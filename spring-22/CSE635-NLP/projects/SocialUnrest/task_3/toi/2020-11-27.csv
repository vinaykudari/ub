0,Education for all: Punjab govt faces an uphill task,"MULLANPUR: The Punjab government plans to achieve lofty targets under the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). All children in the age group of six to 14 years to be enrolled by December 2003, all children in the above age group to have completed five yearâ€™s schooling by 2007 and eight years by 2010 and universal retention by 2010. However, the figures on the ground point out that it will be an uphill task.

Punjab has over three lakh out of school children. The dropout rate in classes sixth to eighth is 27 per cent and as far as nationwide literacy levels are concerned Punjab is placed a low 15 among the states. In fact Punjab is still way behind in achieving the SSAâ€™s goal of education for all.

A family survey conducted by the education department in 2002 pointed out that even though there is a primary school within walking distance (one kilometre) of every village and a health teacher-pupil ratio of less than 40 students per teacher, there had been a decline in the state primary schools in the last five years.

But the officials of the education department claim that the SSA will change all that. It has initiated schemes such as the Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) for promoting education in villages.

â€˜â€˜In a village survey conducted by the department to evaluate the access of elementary education, 10,586 locations having out of school children were identified. These have been chosen to open the EGS centres,â€™â€™ said Baldev Raj, director of SCERT who is also looking after the SSA.

â€˜â€˜Under the EGS we are targeting communities which have out of school children and cannot send them to schools due to some reason even though they would want to. If such community having at least 20 out of school children approaches us we will take the school to them.

The community has to provide a room and some other basic infrastructure and the department will appoint a volunteer who will teach the children at the time they choose,â€™â€™ said Anurag Sidhu, assistant state project director, SSA.

In addition block resource centres are being set up in 140 blocks and 1,500 cluster resource centres will be set up. Under the SSA funds have also been released for training of 84,477 teachers and 1, 54,630 village education development committee members.

1,Corporator told minister to stop slum razing,"MUMBAI: Congress corporator from Antop Hill, Ravi Raja on Thursday admitted that he had approached minister of state for home (rural) Kripa Shankar Singh and asked him to stop the demolition of hutments in Wadala by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority.

As reported by this newspaper, Mr Singh had then telephonically instructed the local police not to provide security cover to the MMRDA staff, who wanted to remove these encroachers in order to construct a new road. Mr Raja also said that he had written to chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde, requesting him to direct the authority to carry out a final survey of those slumdwellers whom the MMRDA had found to be illegal encroachers.

T he 1.5 km proposed road is between IMAX in Wadala and Sion junction. Mr Raja claimed that the MMRDA had not properly verified the documents of about 80 slum families, who had been declared ineligible for alternate accommodation.

Under the state governmentâ€™s slum policy, all hutments constructed prior to January 1, 1995 are deemed protected and their occupants are entitled to free tenements of about 225 sq ft each.

Those shanties which have come up after this cut-off date can be demolished anytime and the encroachers are not entitled to get free houses.

The MMRDA claimed that these 80 shanties were constructed after the cut-off date. However, Mr Raja said, â€œThere were 500 hutments coming in the way of this proposed road. Of these, 350 were found eligible and shifted elsewhere. Most of the remaining unauthorised hutments were demolished. But the whole issue centres around these 80 slum families, who are in possession of proper documents that entitles them to get alternate accommodation,â€™â€™ he claimed.

Raja added that the three member committee appointed by the government to carry out a survey of these slumdwellers did not do a proper job.

â€œOf these 80 slum families, as many as 45 of them are living on municipal land and have got photo passes issued by the BMC way back in 1976,â€™â€™ he said.

The Congress corporator further alleged that the new road was being constructed only to help a private developer, who has not been able to sell his buildings in Wadala.

â€œThere are about 40 buildings, both residential and commercial, in Bhakti Park constructed by this developer. There are no takers for the apartments because there is no proper access road. Once this road is constructed, the property prices in this area will shoot up,â€™â€™ he alleged.

MMRDA officials have debunked Mr Rajaâ€™s allegations. According to them, the government-appointed committee had thrice carried out a survey of the slumdwellers to find out whether they were entitled for rehabilitation or not.

â€œWe have already spent Rs 5 crore to rehouse 340 slum families,â€™â€™ an MMRDA official said. The authority had purchased a building from the housing board in Wadala to resettle these eligible slumdwellers. â€œWork on the road has been held up since June because we have been unable to remove these encroachments,â€™â€™ the official said.

2,Assam govt failed to control violence: Swami,"NEW DELHI: Minister of state for home I D Swami has blamed the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government in Assam for not taking swift action in quelling the anti-Bihari violence in the state.

Speaking to reporters after the CRPF investiture ceremony here on Thursday, Swami said: â€˜â€˜It (the violence) is very unfortunate. Basically anti-social elements and, in particular, ULFA is fanning this violence. Had the state government acted quickly in the beginning itself when the violence erupted, the situation would have been brought under control soon.â€™â€™

He said: â€˜â€˜There was delay in seeking the help of the Army also.â€™â€™

About the state governmentâ€™s complaint of the Centre not sending enough para-military forces, Swami said: â€˜â€˜The government has already deployed sufficient CRPF personnel. There were 113 CRPF companies already in Assam, 25 companies were rushed by the Centre and at least 10 companies are deployed on the Nagaland and Assam border.â€™â€™

4,Battle of sexes at Luta elections,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow University teachers Nishi Pandey and GS Bhadauria are once again face to face, albeit this time for different reason. On Thursday, both filed their nominations for the post of president of Lucknow University Teachers Association (Luta).

The two have been at ''war'' earlier when Dr Bhadauria reprtedly had passed lewd remarks at Dr Pandey in the proctor office in the presence of number of teachers in June 2000. Although the LU executive council had exonerated Bhadauria, who teaches in department of Ancient Indian History (AIH), from the charges, but the matter is still pending with chancellor''s office on the complaint of Dr Pandey, who teaches in department of English and Modern European Languages, LU. Her appointment as director Academic Staff College, UGC, was challenged, but UGC granted her extension.

In 1996, Dr Bhadauria was accused of sexual harassment by girl students and last year he was arrested for alleged involvement in a murderous assault on another teacher, Dr Manoj Dixit. He has been, however, exonerated from the sexual harassment case, but Dixit case was still pending in the court.

Dr Bhadauria raised objection over Dr Pandey''s eligibility for contesting elections, which was overruled by the returning officer Dr BKPN Singh. Dr Pandey''s nomination was proposed by Dr Nishith Rai, director tourism studies and a faculty member of AIH department and Dr Bhadauria''s proposer was Prof VD Pandey, head MIH department and controller of examinations, LU. In their manifestoes, both have promised welfare measures for teachers including pursuing LU authorities to hold selection committees for promotion and recruitment of teachers and make efforts for regularisation of part-time teachers.

Dr Pandey, in her ''16 steps to success'', has promised to make efforts for central status for LU, increase in superannuation age of teachers from 60 to 62 years, inclusion of Luta in policy formulation for university, develop Luta as a centre of consultancy to help teachers in research work and promote them at national and international platform among other things. Dr Bhadauria has promised to ''fight vigorously'' against ""harassment and humiliation"" of teachers, ''government orders'' hampering university''s autonomy and restoration of medical facility for teachers besides ''creating a cordial atmosphere'' on the campus and to end ''Babu Raj'' in university.

5,EC's rider casts shadow over Council polls,"LUCKNOW: Thanks to a recent election panel circular, several representatives of gram panchayats and town-area committees from Sidharthanagar and Mainpuri may not be able to cast votes in the biennial elections to the UP Legislative Council from local authorities constituencies.

The state will elect 35 Council members from such constituencies for the 36 seats on December 1. Banbari Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party has been declared elected unopposed from the Badaun seat.

The unprecedented step was taken by the returning officers of the two districts following a circular issued by the Election Commission that names of those members of local authorities, who have no voting rights in their respective bodies, should not be included in the electoral rolls.

This is in consonance with the decision of the Supreme Court that MLAs who are not allowed to vote in the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly, by reasons of any stay order, etc, should not be allowed to vote in Rajya Sabha polls.

Incidentally, the Karnataka High Court has also ruled in the Shivanna vs State of Karnataka and Others case that ex-officio members like MPs, MLAs etc, could not vote in the local authorities constituencies.

""When a nominated MLA has no voting right in the Assembly, how do they expect to enjoy the same in the local authorities polls?"" asked an EC official.

""In view of the same, names of nominated or ex-officio members, if any, included in the rolls, were deleted,"" said an official of the EC.

""Obviously, this order of the EC has left many MLAs and MPs out of the electoral rolls for the Council poll,"" admitted the official. The returning officers, said the official, were told to comply with the order by November 14.

Ironically, for the 35 Council seats, 209 candidates are still in the fray. And for them, 1.16 lakh voters will caste votes. ""However, as this order of the EC may drastically change the outcome of the poll, eyebrows are being raised in political circles,"" admitted a senior EC official.

6,CM rules out suit against newspapers,"BANGALORE: Chief minister M. Krishna on Thursday clarified that he had no intentions of filing defamation suits against the media for dragging his and some Congress leadersâ€™ names in the fake stamp paper scam.

Conveying the stand, sources quoting Krishna said his target for filing the suit was BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.

â€œThe media is not my target with whom I have a good rapport. Besides, I have nothing against the media and they came into the picture only on technical grounds by carrying Naqviâ€™s statements,â€™â€™ sources added.

On November 25, Krishna, had named Naqvi and four newspapers against whom he planned to file defamation suits for â€œtarnishing his and the Congress leadersâ€™ image,â€™â€™ in the scam. Naqvi had demanded a CBI probe into the issue.

The defamation suit will be filed against Naqvi in the Delhi High Court shortly, sources said.

Poll talks: Krishna, who cancelled all official engagements, spent most part of Thursday at his official residence â€˜Anugrahaâ€™ holding discussions with ministers and party leaders on the Congress prospects in districts in the Council elections on December 1.

He also finalised the candidates for Bangalore mayor and deputy mayor posts, elections to which will be held on Friday. Krishna, later left for Delhi.

7,Mayoral polls today; Cong picks Ramesh,"BANGALORE: The Congress on Thursday cleared the names of V.V. Puram corporator P.R. Ramesh and Mathikere corporator G. Basavaraju for the posts of mayor and deputy mayor, respectively.

The mayoral elections for 2003-04 will be held on Friday. This year, the mayorâ€™s post is reserved for the BCA category and deputy mayor is general. Chief minister S.M. Krishna had convened a meeting of city legislators, KPCC office-bearers and the City, Rural and Urban district chiefs to decide on the candidates.

The high commandâ€™s initial thinking was to choose a candidate from the Bangalore North Lok Sabha constituency and pick Shivajinagar corporator Mumtaz Begum for the mayorâ€™s post. Also, in view of the forthcoming Assembly elections, the party wanted to pick a candidate from the minority community. But this strategy could not be pursued.

The party had to consider Rameshâ€™s candidature as he was denied the post thrice previously. Also, if the government had to consider Ramesh for the post next year, the category will have to be either General or BCA.

â€œThe mayorâ€™s post was reserved for the General category twice and BCA once over the last three years and the same categories cannot be repeated. Also, considering his seniority, Ramesh was the obvious choice,â€™â€™ party sources said.

The party is likely to reserve the mayorâ€™s post for BCA woman next year to accommodate Mumtaz Begum, sources stated. Ramesh, who belongs to the Tigala community, is a third-term corporator and has held various posts in the Council â€” he was the floor leader twice, and chairperson of various standing committees.

Ramesh, 43, is a diploma holder in civil engineering. Basavaraju (55), a first-term corporator, is from the Kuruba community. He has studied up to SSLC.

8,Muslim farmer maps temples,"KOLKATA: He became famous as the symbol of national integration a few years ago when he united people of all communities in Midnapore to preserve remnants of 34 ancient temples.

He also wrote a well-researched book on the history of the Pathra region â€” Mandirmoy Pathrar Itibritta â€” which earned him the Kabir Award from the President of India.

And now, 50-year-old Yasin Pathan has taken several steps at the same time. â€œI have updated my book from the original 100 pages to 350 pages with new findings and a list of 1,061 temples, mosques, churches, Jain temples and castles in undivided Midnapore,â€� said the modest farmer whoâ€™s writing style belies his lack of formal education (he studied till class VIII).

But more importantly, Pathan is now on the verge of completing his second book which will be of immense historical importance â€” a cartographic masterpiece where a series of maps will throw light on the 1,061 ancient structures dotting Midnapore, some almost 2,000 years old.

â€œI have enlisted the services of good cartographers to help me complete the book. All the maps will be accompanied by photographs and artistsâ€™ impressions of the structures, along with a short historical sketch on each. I hope this book also gets the support of the Indian Council of Historical Research when itâ€™s ready,â€� Pathan told TNN.

His earlier book has been partly funded by ICHR and is being marketed by Deyâ€™s Publishing. On Thursday, Pathan met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who formally released the revised second edition of the book.

Pathan had to defy religious bigots to form a committee to preserve the ancient temples.

Later, he launched a movement to make the area a centre of tourism. â€œThings started moving when the Archaeological Survey of India showed interest and the Centre granted Rs 20 lakh to conserve five temples.

Finally in July 2003, the ASI issued a notification taking over 28temples. Today I am a happy man,â€� he said.

9,"Abducted boy freed, 2 arrested","HYDERABAD: A second standard student of St Martin School at Saipuri Colony in Malkajgiri, who was abducted by two persons of the same locality, was rescued by the police on Thursday. The kidnappers, who demanded a ransom of Rs 2.5 lakh for the childâ€™s release, have been arrested.

The arrested persons have been identified as Makdum Ali Khan, 25, and Mukaram Ali Khan, 23. Malkajgiri police said the duo kidnapped Sai Praneet, the son of Venkateswar Rao, while he was returning home from school on Tuesday evening.

The abductors then made calls to Rao and demanded a ransom of Rs 2.5 lakh for the childâ€™s release. They threatened to kill the boy if Rao lodged a complaint with the police. Rao, a middle class railway employee, got frightened and lodged a complaint. The Malkajgiri police laid a trap and arrested the duo near Nagole on Wednesday evening.

During interrogation, the accused revealed that they had kidnapped the boy when he was returning home by using a motor cycle. The duo went around various localities and made ransom calls from different telephone booths.

Both the kidnappers were reportedly facing financial problems, and saw the abduction as a ticket out of the trouble they were in.

10,Govt move for polls of pharmacy council,"PATNA: The state government has initiated measures to hold the election of Bihar State Pharmacy Council after a gap of 48 years. In fact, election to the state pharmacy council had been held only once -- way back in 1955.

The Patna High Court had recently asked the state government to hold the election at the earliest.

The government''s failure to hold pharmacy council elections for such a long period is quite surprising since there are several thousand registered pharmacists in Bihar. In fact, at present there are 22,400 registered pharmacists in Bihar and Jharkhand.

The council was being run by state government nominees all these years though as per the provisions of Pharmacy Act, 1948, there should have always been six elected pharmacists in the council.

The state pharmacy council is constituted by the state government under the Pharmacy Act with the basic objective of registration of pharmacists as per the provisions of the Act.

In view of the Patna High Court order, chief secretary K A H Subramanian recently discussed the issue with medical education secretary Afzal Amanullah and secretary of Bihar State Pharmacy Council Dr D K Singh and asked them to find ways to hold the pharmacy council elections to elect six pharmacists at the earliest.

Amanullah said that the state government has sanctioned Rs 12.5 lakh to the council for holding the elections.

The government will release the fund to the pharmacy council from Bihar Contingency Fund. Amanullah said that the state pharmacy council had initiated measures to prepare draft electoral roll.

Thereafter, he said, objections to the roll, if any, would be be invited. He said that the government would take about six months to hold the election.

The state government had recently constituted a three-member committee headed by additional director, medical education, Dr Aruna Sinha, to probe into complaints of fake registration of pharmacists in the state. The Pharmacy Council of India (PCI), which had been receiving a number of complaints regarding fake registration of pharmacists in Bihar, had on September 26 requested the Bihar chief secretary to order an inquiry into the matter.

11,CBI asks state govt to give question leak details,"PATNA: CBI director P C Sharma has asked Bihar DGP D P Ojha to furnish details of the leakage of question papers of various competitive examinations in the state in recent years.

Consequently, the DGP has directed all SPs to collect details for submission to the CBI for further probe.

Inquiries reveal that several cases of leakage of question papers of competitive exams, including Combined Medical and Dental Test and civil court examination, had come to light in Bihar in recent years. The questions of bank exams had also reportedly leaked.

The case of gross irregularities in the entrance test for medical and dental courses in Bihar first came to light during 1996. According to a finding of the vigilance department, at least 60 per cent seats of the MBBS and PG medical courses were sold out. Besides, at least five per cent seats of these two examinations were reserved by the mafia for distribution free of cost to influential persons of the state, sources said.

Inquiries also reveal that the going rate for an MBBS seat was between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7 lakh while for a PG seat it ranged from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, vigilance department sources said.

For admission to best medical colleges in the state, the rate per student was Rs 7 lakh while for the lower-ranking colleges it was Rs 5 lakh. Similarly, for admission to PG courses in medicine and orthopaedic departments, the rate was Rs 10 lakh.

For non-clinical faculties, the rate per candidate was Rs 5 lakh. Sources also said that there was a well-organised mafia operating in the business of leaking question papers in different parts of the state. If by chance a candidate was caught red-handed while cheating, the gang used to manage the candidate to flee in order to protect the identity of the kingpin.

Police sources also said that the mafia was always in search of â€œtalented scouts (talented students)â€� for grooming such candidates for appearing in various competitive medical examinations in place of bonafide candidates.

After selecting â€œtalented scoutsâ€�, usually called â€œenginesâ€�, the mafia used to provide them â€œfive-star treatmentâ€�, such as accommodation, food and other facilities, at various examination centres for a couple of months. The â€œenginesâ€� were also given advance money for their efforts.The government had submitted this case to the CBI for further investigation way back in 1999. But, due to pre-occupation of the CBI, the matter could not be followed up.

12,"Don't want votes, just chief ministership: Uma","SATAI, Chattarpur: With a smile on her face, she is confidence personified as she arrived by a chopper on her election campaign.

And the first thing BJPâ€™s chief ministerial candidate in Madhya Pradesh Uma Bharti tells her responsive audience is that she has not come to them to seek votes. But she does it all the same in a different way.

â€˜â€˜How can a daughter, a grand-daughter, ask you for votes,â€™â€™ the â€˜â€˜sanyasinâ€™â€™ says striking an emotional chord with the local populace.

She, however, hastens to add, â€˜â€˜Your daughter is going to be the chief minister and so it is for you to protect your prestige (â€˜izzatâ€™).â€™â€™

Telling the audience in this backward constituency that she will not make a long speech, as constant campaigning has taken a toll of her throat, Bharti is at her friendly best.

As if she read Dale Carnegieâ€™s book â€˜â€˜How to win friends and influence peopleâ€™â€™ only yesterday, she goes about giving an impression that she wants to erase the image of being temperamental.

Bharti is at pains to explain why she has chosen this constituency despite being acutely aware of her brother Swami Lodh who represents it had not done justice to it. She said she is contesting from Bada Malhera constituency as she says that by choosing to contest from here she is trying to rectify a wrong.

â€˜â€˜Last time I had asked you that a vote for Swami is a vote for me. Since he did not work for the constituency, I quarrelled with him and now I am repaying the debt,â€™â€™ Bharti said.

In the short speech, Bharti, who also has on her mind the caste arithmetic, said a vote for her would strengthen PM Vajpayee who is a Brahmin. â€œI am also a Kshatriya besides I am also a daughter of a Kisan,â€™â€™ she said. PTI

14,Shinde gives clean chit to his ministers,"NEW DELHI: Accusing the Centre of waking up late in the multi-crore fake stamp paper case, Maharashtra Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde on Friday asserted that none of his Ministers were involved but said if anybody was guilty, he would not be spared.

A day after the indicted police official R S Sharma claimed that some ministers'' names had figured in investigations revealing links with the prime accused, Shinde told reporters here that the Special Investigating Team (SIT) was going into the matter and the Mumbai High Court had reposed confidence in the investigation.

The Chief Minister said no Minister in his Government figured in the scam. Whosoever was found guilty would be sternly dealt with. ""There will be no effort to shield anybody,"" he said.

Stating that the scandal was going on for almost nine to ten years from the time when the Shiv Sena-BJP Government was in power, Shinde said the Centre ""woke up"" to the scam only two months ago.

""The Government should have taken cognisance in 2001 and ordered a CBI probe,"" he said.

Refuting Centre''s charge that the Maharashtra Government was not willing to hand over the case to CBI, Shinde said he could not take the stand outside the court that the matter be referred to CBI. He would have no objecttion if the Court directed a CBI probe.

The Mumbai High Court on Thursday had declined to hand over the case to CBI for the time being and directed the SIT to cooperate with the Central agency if it needed any information regarding the scam.

Shinde expressed surprise that even two months ago the then Additional Solicitor General had said that CBI was not prepared to take over the probe as it was over burdened but now the CBI was ready for the investigation. ""I do not know what has happened during these two months,"" he said.

""The present investigations are on the right track. On what grounds can one doubt the integrity (of SIT),"" he asked and pointed out that even senior officials were not being spared.

To a question, Shinde said the scam would not tarnish the image of his Congress party in Maharashtra or in other states, particularly in the poll-bound states where the stakes of his party are high.

15,Assembly polls will decide future of politics: Naidu,"INDORE: BJP President, M Venkaiah Naidu said here on Friday that the results of Assembly elections in four states would decide the future of politics in the country and pointed out that they could lead to the emergence of a third front.

The BJP president told reporters at the Indore press club that the Congress position would be weakened after the poll results were declared as these would not be in its favour.

Naidu, however, said that the results of the Assembly elections would not affect the NDA government at the Centre.

He said that even after the declaration of results for the Assembly polls, there would be no change in dates for holding the next Lok Sabha polls which shall be held on schedule.

Naidu said that Congress governments had nothing to show on the development front and added that its allegations of corruption against Union ministers had backfired on it.

16,Gujarat govt damns itself!,"GANDHINAGAR: A state government document has questioned the rationale of basing Gujaratâ€™s water resource development strategy on dams.

It emphasises that all large, medium and minor dams constructed on major river systems have led to severe degradation in downstream areas, impacted ground-water recharge, destroyed of flood plain wetlands, increased salinity ingress and damaged natural ecosystems in river estuaries.

Called â€œEnvironmental Action Programme for Gujarat: Problems, Causes and Strategiesâ€�, the draft report prepared for the state government by the Gujarat Ecology Commission (GEC) says â€œAll river systems that have been dammed in the state are experiencing the problem of downstream degradation. But they are particularly acute in the rivers of the semi-arid region of north Gujarat.â€�

Under natural conditions Sabarmati, Banas, Rupen and Saraswati rivers would contribute significantly to the recharge of the alluvial acquifer of the region. The major recharge zones in these areas were the Aravalli foothills on the eastern and northern sides, where these rivers enter the plains, and the expansive flood plains that form the natural course.

â€œThis process of natural recharge was disrupted after the construction of damsâ€�, it says. Giving instances of Dantiwada and Sipu dams on Banas river, it points out that before the dams were constructed, the river had no definite banks.

â€œIt wandered freely over a width of 15-20 miles, the bed slope was less than a foot per mile, and the fertile silt brought by the river and the flood waters yielded a good crop of Rabi wheat. â€œThese dams totally disrupted this process of natural irrigation, soil building and leeching of salts, disrupting the agricultural production of this area.â€�

Kutchâ€™s Banni grassland, the largest in the country, stands destroyed also due to a series of dams on the north flowing rivers, substantially stopping the freshwater runoff to the region, it says. Reduced river flow, the document underlines, has also aggravated the problems of river pollution.

It adds, â€œOften the stretches of rivers downstream dams carry only sewerage and industrial effluents during the non-monsoon period. This problem is particularly severe in Sabarmati, Damanganga, Bhadar and Shetruji.â€�

Yet another impact, the document says, is on riverine and estuarine ecosystems. The reduction of peak flow, when many fish species breed, and the loss of nutrients trapped in the dam reservoirs adversely affect downstream fisheries. The collapse of the Hilsa fishery in the Tapi estuary is directly attributed to the Ukai dam.

Suggesting some of these problems can be solved once the Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) is completed and there inter-basin transfer of Narmada waters from south Gujarat to these regions, the document however warns that many critical problems will remain unresolved.

The main areas of north Gujarat in Mehsana and Sabarkantha districts suffering from alarming depletion of the ground-water aquifers are outside SSP command and will not receive any water for agricultural use. This is also true of large parts Saurashtra, it says.

17,Bank workers rally against privatisation,"AHMEDABAD: The Mahagujarat Bank Employeesâ€™ Association on Thursday staged demonstrations here in protest against the governmentâ€™s move to privatise nationalised banks.

Affiliated to the All-India Bank Employeesâ€™ Association, the MBEA has strongly opposed the governmentâ€™s move to reduce its stake from 51 per cent or more to 33 per cent.

The plan to allow 74 per cent foreign investments in private banks initially is a dangerous one, said an MBEA release.

The restructuring and writing-off of huge non-performing assets by banks due to pressure from the government and politicians is actually loot of the public money, alleged the release.

Instead of recovering dues from rich industrialists, who have diverted their loans for personal use, they are being substantially written off by top managements of banks, the MBEA alleged.

Taking a cue from Iftar parties, BJP and Congress candidates are wooing voters in Vasant Kunj and Rohini with luncheons and dinners. About seven such parties, four by BJP candidate Sat Parkash Rana and Congress candidate Vijay Singh Lochav have already been hosted in Vasant Kunj. Besides, a couple of parties are being hosted exclusively for senior citizens.

For Kulwant Rana, the BJP candidate from Shahbad Daulatpur, the occasion was tailor made. â€˜â€˜Rana invited about 10,000 Rohini residents recently on the occasion of the shradh (death anniversary) of his father. This is the first time in the last 12 years that he has observed it on such a scale. About 7,000 people turned up,â€™â€™ said a resident, requesting anonymity.

Vasant Kunj residents said that on an average, about 1,000 guests make it to such parties, where the menu is â€˜â€˜normalâ€™â€™. Drinks are not â€˜â€˜visibleâ€™â€™, but they are not absent either. One such party was, in fact, held in a swanky motel on the Jaipur highway.

As a resident put it, â€˜â€˜Who cares about the menu? Itâ€™s free andwe attend the parties of both candidates.â€™â€™

Lochav is not far behind and his supporters are throwing parties. The agenda: Attract as many residents as possible.

19,"Scamsters bent rules, changed housing norms","MUMBAI: Six officials, including three Mantralaya staffers, were arrested recently by the state CID for allegedly fabricating documents to swindle funds meant for backward class housing in 1999-2000.

The scamsters sought Rs 1.44 crore as financial assistance from the state government to purchase a 16,000 sq ft plot in Nerul for their â€˜Siti Tower Cooperative Housing Societyâ€™.

Well accustomed with the functioning at Mantralaya and using their official positions, the group of 40-odd Mantralaya staffers secured speedy clearance for their proposal and also got the finance ministry to issue a part payment of Rs 92 lakhs on March 31, 2000, for their housing society.

Interestingly, the Nerul plot was already in possession of 20 CIDCO gardeners, who were gifted the property by the corporation for their housing society.

The CIDCO staffers, who received the plot at a highly subsidised rate of Rs 47.39 lakhs, had proposed the name of their society as â€˜Citi Towerâ€™.

In Marathi, â€˜Sitiâ€™ and â€˜Citiâ€™ are pronounced and written in the same way. Moreover, the Mantralaya officials exploited the fact that all government applications and communications are in Marathi.

The scam came to light after the state authorities decided to check the registration of the controversial housing society before releasing the balance payment.

â€œThe government investigation revealed that Siti Tower cooperative housing society was never registered.We came to know that the Nerul plot was still vacant and that some deal was being worked out by a builder and Mantralaya officials with the CIDCO gardeners for transfer of their plot to Siti Tower society,â€™â€™ a government source said.

Inquiries further revealed that the Mantralaya officials, to achieve their means, cleverly manipulated rules and successfully changed the norms for the backward class housing scheme.

â€œThe earlier criteria demanded that beneficiaries should have an annual income below Rs 96,000 and should also produce caste certificates as proof of their tribal status. However, the income criteria was relaxed and there was no ceiling on income. Moreover, 10 members of their society were not even tribals and hence the entire proposal was faulty,â€™â€™ the official said.

20,State govt yet to get its stamp act together,"MUMBAI: It seems the Maharashtra government isnâ€™t ready to get its act together even after the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam has ravaged the state exchequer.

Six years after the scam was first reported, the Maharashtra government is yet to evolve a fool-proof mechanism for the supply of judicial and non-judicial stamps to citizens.

Inquiries revealed that the Democratic Front government has been hemming and hawing on how to curb the tampering of official documents. Except holding a series of meetings, the Mantralaya officials have done precious little in the last two years to ensure that lâ€™affaire Telgi doesnâ€™t repeat in the state.

Much before the city police seized large consignments of fake stamp papers, the DF government held a routine meeting at Sahyadri, the state government guest house, in November 2001.

The agenda was to consider a proposal for modern technology to avoid duplication and forgery of crucial government documents and certificates.

Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal presided over the conclave, which was attended by a large number of key officials from several departments handling the supply of stamp papers to citizens.

A K Sharma and Sujata Tiwari of Brand Protection also attended the high-powered meeting to hammer out a slew of measures to curb counterfeiting and duplication of important documents, it is learnt.

As a follow up, the inspector general of registration of the state government, Nitin Kareer, wrote to the revenue department and the Indian security press, Nashik, asking them to consider replicating the Israeli experiment of Latent Image technology as a safety measure.

However, the state administration remained inactive till January 2002 when the police seized fake stamp papers valued at Rs 2,100 crore near Bhiwandi. Rattled by the seizure, the state government convened yet another meeting to consider the new technology.

Bhujbal, finance minister Jayant Patil and then revenue minister Ashok Chavan participated in the deliberations on June 27, 2002.

As the fake stamp paper scam had by then bared its fangs across several states, the chief of Nashik security press too was invited to participate in the talks, along with representatives of other central agencies which deal with forgeries.

A D Sawant, a specialist in chemistry, offered his views on the Latent Image technology, while Latent Imageâ€™s Indian representative Rajesh Awachat made a presentation. Transparent polymer films are used in the new technology.

The images, which are totally invisible to the naked eye, become visible only when held under standard polariser. No decision was taken on the new technology.

However, after much dilly-dallying and loss of time, a government resolution was mooted in March 2003. This paved the way for another committee which was asked to decide whether the new technology was compatible with the existing technology used by various state government departments as well as the Nashik security press.

The latest take on the issue is home secretary U K Mukhopadhyayâ€™s letter to the Union home ministry urging the Centre to assess the viability of the Latent Image technology.

21,State govt staffers in CID net,"MUMBAI: The long arm of the law has finally caught up with group of Mantralaya officials and City and Industrial Development Corporation staffers involved in embezzling public funds amounting to Rs 1.44 crore.

Six officials were arrested recently by the state CID for allegedly fabricating documents to swindle funds meant for backward class housing in 1999-2000.

The scam was first reported by this newspaper in August 2000. The arrests of Vasant D. Valvi, Virjim D. Naik and Vijay N. Itkyal, all of whom hold key posts in the state agriculture and finance ministry in Mantralaya, has exposed the nexus between these officers and builders.

The CID officials, led by superintendent of police S.K. Padvi, arrested the trio along with CIDCO staffers Arjun Agaskar, Pandurang Mhatre and N R Patil for pocketing Rs 92 lakhs of the Rs 1.44 crore in March 2000, which was sanctioned as state assistance for a tribalsâ€™ housing plan.

â€œThese are just preliminary arrests. We have to nab the entire team of over 30 Mantralaya officials and some staff of CIDCO who are involved in the fraud,â€™â€™ Mr Padvi told TNN on Thursday. The authorities are also on the lookout for the Navi Mumbai-based builder.

The scam was plotted in 1999 when a group of 40-odd Mantralaya officials conspired with the builder and sought Rs 1.44 crore as financial assistance under the backward class housing plan.The group intended to purchase a 16,000 sq ft plot in Nerul for their â€˜Siti Tower Cooperative Housing Societyâ€™.

22,Norms needed for scribes covering arrests: HC,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday directed the Mumbai police commissioner P S Pasricha to lay down guidelines as to when the police can take journalists along to cover the arrest of an accused.

Justice Shiavax Vajifdar, who passed the order, observed that he was â€œdisturbedâ€™â€™ by the contentions in a suit filed by a city businessman Jasmin Shah for damages against Sony TV and others.

Jasmin Shah, owner of Rupayatan, a building in Vile Parle, had filed a suit against the TV channel, Ramesh Shah, who is one of the directors of Sony Mony Electronics Limited and officers of the D N Nagar police station, Andheri, for televising his arrest in an allegedly false case against him.

Shahâ€™s arrest and his presence at the D.N. Nagar police station last month was filmed by Sony TV for a show called â€˜Crime Patrolâ€™.

The court did not restrain Sony TV from telecasting â€˜Crime Patrolâ€™ at 10.30 p.m. on Friday night since it was broadcast from Singapore.

The judge, however, directed Pasricha to hold an inquiry into the matter. Taking serious note of the fact that the D N Nagar police officers were not present in the court for the hearing, the judge directed them to file an affidavit to explain why Shahâ€™s arrest was allowed to be filmed. Ramesh Shah was also directed to file his affidavit in the matter.

Advocate Mukesh Vashi, who represented Jasmin Shah, said the D N Nagar police officer in alleged collusion with the complainant Ramesh Shah had invited TV reporters to record his clientâ€™s arrest, which amounted to defamation.

He said that Ramesh Shah, who was interested in buying the ground floor premises of Jasmin Shahâ€™s building, had filed a complaint over a property dispute against his client at the D N Nagar police station on October 22.

At 2.30 am the next day, the police along with the TV crew had come to Jasmin Shahâ€™s house to take him to the police station, Vashi said.

Virag Tulzapurkar, counsel for Sony TV, said the channel was only showing facts and hence the contents were not defamatory.

Vashi said Ramesh Shah claimed to have paid Rs 1.5 crore in cash in February 2000 to Jasmin Shah towards buying the ground floor premises which was occupied by a bank.

He said since the bank had not shifted out of the premises, the transaction was delayed and Ramesh Shah filed a complaint that Jasmin had allegedly threatened him not to seek his money back.
