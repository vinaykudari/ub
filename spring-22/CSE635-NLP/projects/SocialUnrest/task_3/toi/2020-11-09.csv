0,It's a party as CM's in trouble,"NEW DELHI: The BJP is launching a two-pronged campaign against Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh as the surveys it has conducted show he is more unpopular than his party, the Congress, party sources say. Madhya Pradesh is the state the BJP rates as the one it is most likely to win.

The first element in the campaign, a senior party leader said on Sunday, was â€” to use advertising parlance â€” â€˜â€˜reposition Digvijay Singhâ€™â€™ by not mentioning him by name or as â€˜â€˜Diggy Rajaâ€™â€™ or as the CM, but as â€˜â€˜Shriman Bantadhar (Mister Destruction)â€™â€™ to drive home the point about lack of development.

Therefore, some of the slogans the party intends using are â€˜â€˜Sarak, bijli aur rozgaar, das saal me bantadhar; loot, khasaut aur bhrashtachar, das saal me bantadhar; apharan, hatya aur balatkaar, das saal me bantadharâ€™â€™ or â€˜â€˜Shriman Bantadhar ko door se namashkaarâ€™â€™ or â€˜â€˜Andheri nagri, chaupat rajaâ€™â€™.

The second element will also be indirectly directed against Digvijay, who is a Rajput. Using the fact that 52 per cent of the population is OBC, it will stress its chief ministerial candidate, Uma Bharati, and the man it has nominated to take on Digvijay, party general secretary Shivraj Singh Chauhan, are both OBCs.

The BJP also intends to make a push to defeat Digvijay in Raghoghar, his constituency, not just by fielding a strong candidate, but by assigning the constituency two powerful election managers â€” former Maharashtra deputy CM Gopinath Munde and senior BJP Bihar leader Sushil Modi.

1,New power policy by month end,"LUCKNOW: A new power policy by November end, development of state-of-the-art townships, involvement of private sector in giving a fillip to the cottage industry and formation of a committee to overlook water problem were some of the major decisions taken at the State Development Council (SDC) meeting here on Sunday.

Addressing a joint press conference, SDC chairman Amar Singh and chief secretary AP Singh said the new power policy would be announced by November end following directives to this effect from chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav ,who was also present at the meet for a short time.

Nine renowned consultants who had worked on the issue presented their proposals on how changes for the betterment of the energy sector could be effected.

The proposals were not only limited to generation, transmission and distribution but also increasing the duration of supply to the rural areas from the existing 14 to 18 hours.

The participants at the meet who included Anil Ambani, Subrata Roy and others were of the view that no development or investment in any sector, particularly agriculture, was possible without adequate and good quality power. Singh said the current power policy was influenced by political considerations.

As regards housing, the NDC took the decision to develop some state-of- the-art townships replete with hospitals, schools, hotels, air strips and other amenities on the pattern of those existing in Bangalore, Hyderabad and some other cities.

The need for this arose as it was found that good quality life was one of the major deterrents for investment in fields like information technology, tourism etc. The growth potential areas for the development of such townships were being identified.

As regards the rich cottage industry of Uttar Pradesh spreading from Moradabad to Gorakhpur, the NDC decided that the designing and display of the products should be handed over to the private sector.

Amar Singh said a committee had been constituted to oversee the drinking water problem in the cities and how good quality water could be provided. Issues like putting a check on wastage of water would be included in its ambit.

The terms and conditions of tenders relating to the disinvestment of sugar mills were also placed befor the SDC, stated the chief secretary.

The chairman specified that the SDC had in no way burdened the government and all the expenditure including the payment to the consultants, the repair work being effected in the building taken on rent for housing the NDC staff, were being borne by the NDC itself.

In response to a query he said people desirous of investing in the state were welcomed but there would be no addition to the core group of the Council.

2,WB terms force govt to fight graft,"HYDERABAD: Itâ€™s at the urging of the World Bank that the state government has announced a series of measures to strengthen the anti-corruption agencies.

Sources in the government told The Times of India that the World Bank has been insisting the government to come good on its anti-corruption pledges and civil service reforms if it is to be eligible for the Rs 1,800 crore structural adjustment loan (SAL).

Though the bank has not set any specific deadline for the purpose, the state government is in dire requirement of the loan, particularly in the light of the possibility of early elections.

The government has made budgetary allocations to various sectors assuming that the SAL funding will accrue to it. It needs the loan to implement the welfare measures now popularly known as Koti Varalu.

As the Assembly is unlikely to be convened before the budget session, the government is weighing the possibility of issuing ordinances to give force to the three anti-corruption bills it has drafted recently. These bills empower the government to confiscate the properties of public servants held corrupt; to retrieve money from officials who cause a loss to the exchequer; and to impart transparency to procurement processes.

The government has also agreed to increase the staff and budget for the Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Vigilance & Enforcement (V&E) wing, as suggested by the World Bank. Both these agencies will get additional allocations of about Rs 2 crore each besides required paraphernalia.

The World Bank has also advised the government to strengthen the office of vigilance commissioner (VC) to vest him with powers to refer corruption cases against IAS, IPS and IFS officers to the ACB without having to get the concurrence of the chief secretary.

Government sources said the chief minister wants all the anti-corruption commitments made to the World Bank while negotiating the SAL last implemented by Nov. 30.

A World Bank team, which was here last week, was reportedly satisfied with the governmentâ€™s efforts and it is likely that the first tranche of the Rs 1,800 crore loan will be released from January next year.

3,Arya Samaj to get politically tough,"HYDERABAD: The Arya Samaj has decided to reorient its outlook and objectives by focussing on socio-political issues in the country.

A declaration to this effect was passed at its Pratinidhi Sabha on Saturday. The samaj has resolved to give a ''political punch'' to its movement in the country. Disclosing this at a press conference on Sunday, Arya Samaj working president Swami

Agnivesh said, ""Unfortunately, we have been sidelined, marginalised and degenerating into a religious movement.

Henceforth, we will give a political punch to our movement with spiritual values in tact.''''

However, he said the samaj would not have a tie up with any political party or contest in elections. ""We will support any political party which is not communal,'''' he said, adding that the samaj would not support pulling down of a mosque or mandir.

The samaj would concentrate on problems like gender discrimination and child labour ""We favour uniform civil code as it is not an issue between any two communities,'''' he said.

4,State export rules put artisans in tight spot,"HYDERABAD: The â€˜black metalâ€™ statue makers in the Old City are facing a severe crisis due to several bureaucratic hurdles prevent them from exporting their merchandise. According to the traders, the customs department has an ''aversion'' to the export of these statues as they closely resemble antique statues.

Despite the fact that the basic constituent of the ''black metal'' statues is aluminium, the sellers are forced to get clearance from the archeological department, the traders complained.

With competitors putting up shops in other parts of the country the situation had become more complex.

According to the statue makers, the trade has been progressively declining over the past five years. Though these statue sellers are facing a tough time in the local market, they are in high demand in several foreign countries, especially the western and Gulf countries.

Despite the black metal sellers having a licence to export, the state government insists that they get permission from archeological department to export the idols. With several antiques being smuggled out of the country, the customs department and the state government do not want to take any chances.

These craftsmen have been working harder for the past two years as they have to depend on the exporters from the other states. The artisans cannot export their pieces directly from the state.

Afsar Khan, who has been in the business for the past 40 years, is irked that the government was permitting them to export these moulded idols that are in great demand in foreign countries. ""The government should facilitate the export of statues and other pieces made of black metal,'''' he insists.

Several black metal statue manufactures are even migrating to Delhi, Meerut and Puna from where they can easily export their creations, Khan added.

Some of these statue makers are also facing resistance from their own community as most of these statues are those of gods belonging to the other community.

Abdul Aziz another black metal whole sale dealer says that the making the statues of gods of a another community is against his religion but he does not have a choice.

""We are deeply involved in this business and that is the only source of income for us. We have been criticised several times by the members of our own community and faced a lot of problems. Still we can not help being this trade as we are helpless,'''' Aziz said.

Narsing Rao, who has been in the business for the past 40 years says, ""Ten years ago there was a good margin in the business but with most of the experienced workers and dealers operating from the other states, the demand for these statues originally started in Hyderabad is slowly decreasing.''''

5,Govt plea to refer disinvestment to larger SC Bench,"INDORE: Union communication, information technology and disinvestment minister Arun Shourie on Saturday said the Centre has requested the Supreme Court to refer the disinvestment of public sector oil companies to a larger Bench of the apex court.

Similar cases pending before different high courts of the country should also be referred to the Bench, he told reporters here on the sidelines of a function organised by the Madhya Pradesh Gourav Pratishthan.

Replying to a question about the governmentâ€™s stand on the issue following the apex court ruling, he said â€˜â€˜the government has requested the chief justice of India for a review of the case and also similar cases like Jessop and Hindustan Copper pending in different high courts of the country by referring them to a larger Benchâ€™â€™.

Only after this the government will decide on the issue of taking the matter to the Parliament, he added.

The apex court had held that Parliamentâ€™s approval was necessary for the disinvestment of public sector oil companies like Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) as they were nationalised with Parliamentâ€™s approval.

Defending the disinvestment policy, he maintained that in the past few months, the public sector companies in the country have attracted disinvestments to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore. He said the production capacity of public sector companies which have been given to private sector companies under the policy, has increased by 250 times in the past three months. He said the Oppositionâ€™s failure to support such a crucial issue will not augur well for the country.

Citing the progress made by the country in the past few years in various sectors, the Union minister said: The countryâ€™s export in the IT sector has touched Rs 60,000 crore mark. In the production of automobile accessories, the country has recorded tremendous growth and within a span of one year, export of agro accessories has touched 1.600 million dollar, he said. Similarly, the mobile subscribers base in the country in the past few months has also increased rapidly and every month, 13 to 15 lakh subscribers are added, going by the statistics of the past five months, he said.

Attributing the lack of development in MP to poor governance, he said the state deserved to come at par with Karnataka, which like MP, is also being ruled by a Congress government. He said the state government lacked visionary ideas which hold the key to development.

He said despite having abundance of cultural and natural wealth, the state was lagging behind as the government had no idea to convert its difficulties into opportunities.

To a question, he said as a cabinet minister he had not criticised the government headed by A K Antony nor said anything against its functioning.

""What I said was only the political point as a politician and that too because of the problems that cropped up in the party and after ""I"" faction was sidelined by the leadership"", he said.
