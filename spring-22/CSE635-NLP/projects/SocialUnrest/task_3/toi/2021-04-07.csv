The issue was sorted out when two senior officials rushed to the Rohini office to placate the employees.

The officials promised that salaries would be disbursed by evening. NDPL spokesperson, however, said that there was no delay in disbursement of salaries.

1,'84 riot victims decry apathy of Distt Admn,"KANPUR: The 1984 Riot Victims Association has expressed dismay at the absence of administrative officials and reporters at its Peace Meeting held here on Saturday.

The meeting aimed to make the media aware of the sluggish pace of development in the city, especially in context to the Lok Sabha polls. Members of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were not present either. However, Samajwadi Party, Swantantra Vyapar Mandal and Communist Party of India (Marxist) have vowed to provide them compensation, including the 200 square meters of land here.

President of the association Sardar Manjeet Singh Anand praised the chief minister. â€œWe will always support him,â€� he added. Even after 20 years, the government had ignored the victims, he further added. He alleged that the Kanpur Development Authority was delaying allotment of the 100 plots that had been sanctioned by the state.

General secretary of the association Sardar Ajit Singh Ahluwaliya said that every Sikh here would carry black flag in protest against the government policies, and scams during the polls.

The Congress had reneged on its promise to provide office to the association in New Delhi, he added. He expressed grief over the recent demise of Sardar Guruchan Singh Tohra.

The meeting was attended by Sardar Harjinder Singh Bhasin, who was awarded the Peace Prize by the Punjab government and the King of Nepal.

2,Safdarjung lacks basic equipment,"NEW DELHI: Senior doctors at Safdarjung Hospital are seething over the fact that the hospital could not spend Rs 5.8 crore out of about Rs 15.6 crore plan fund sanctioned during the 2003-04 financial year.

The money was supposed to be spent on machines and equipment.

According to senior doctors, the functioning of various departments of the hospital is being severely affected for want of several essential equipment like CT-scan machine, hydraulic operation table, neonatal ventilators, audiometer, utomatic ELISA processor and intensive care monitors.

A senior doctor of the ENT department said: ""We are severely handicapped because of the lack of basic equipment like rigid bronchoscope and the oesophagoscope. We cannot even treat cases of air or foodpipe blockage, the management of which if delayed too much, can prove fatal. We have to refer all such cases to other hospitals.""

The hospital''s CT-scan machine, which was brought about seven years ago, is in bad shape.

According to a senior doctor: ""The machine keeps breaking down almost every week and is in such a bad shape that the company has refused to renew the annual maintenance contract. It has lived its life.""

Dr R N Salhan, the medical superintendent, said: ""It is not that the amount has been saved. Procuring equipment takes a while, and we plan to use the money to buy some of the very machines the doctors are talking about. A new CT-scan machine and cobalt treatment units for the radiotherapy department, are being procured by the health directorate.""

Asked about the complaints from various departments over lack of equipment, he said: ""The allegations are baseless.""

3,'I chose politics long ago',"AMETHI: At the Munshiganj guest house, Rahul Gandhi has just been asked why he decided to join politics. He looks up and says, ""I made the decision long ago, while travelling on the train carrying my father''s body. I saw a lot of people running after the train. And I thought I must do something for the people who loved my father. And yes, my father was great. He''s my hero.""

A day after Rahul Gandhi''s heart-stopping political debut at Amethi, journalists who''d waited hours to meet him, were irritable and crabby. All hostility evaporated once Rahul came out accompanied by Priyanka and Sonia.

Mother Sonia apologised for the mismanagement. Rahul dimpled sweetly and said sorry. Sonia described Rahul''s political entry as an emotional journey. She said she had come with her husband in 1980 to Sultanpur. ""When I watched Rahul filing his nomination, those memories came flooding back.""

Once Rahul got talking, it was as if the floodgates had opened. He wouldn''t budge even to Sonia''s ""Rahul, we should leave.""

""You guys have this opinion about me. But I''m not shy or reserved. I want to focus on Amethi and I don''t want to distract myself unnecessarily. That is why I''m hesitant to talk to the national media. Yes, a few days back I thought I would be uncomfortable in politics, but you won''t be if you believe in yourself and the people,"" said Rahul when asked about his apparent makeover.

Did he see himself as heir-apparent to India''s oldest political dynasty? ""No, not at all. However, why should I be defensive about belonging to a political family? I''m not a criminal''s son. My grandmother was PM, my father was PM. They did good things for India.""

What if destiny repeated itself? ""I don''t fear for my life. I used to tell my father that politics was dangerous, but he said that was his life.""

And what about the constant sniping on the foreigner issue? ""When Narendra Modi targets my mother and now us, we know we''re on the right track.""

How does he plan to reverse the steady decline of his party? ""I will not claim I have a magic potion. My job is to be honest.""

4,NDA will unveil formula after polls: Advani,"AYODHYA: Paying obeisance to Ram Lala at the makeshift temple here after seven years, Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani on Tuesday dropped broad hints that the Vajpayee government has already made some â€˜positiveâ€™ headway in evolving a â€˜formulaâ€™ for negotiated settlement to the Ayodhya imbroglio.

Launching the final phase of the BJPâ€™s poll campaign from the temple town on the BJPâ€™s foundation day, Advani, however, refused to disclose details of the proposed formula, including names of parties involved in negotiations, which he claimed was the only â€˜enduringâ€™ solution to settle the dispute amicably.

â€œIn the last six years, the Vajpayee government has made concerted efforts to find an amicable, negotiated settlement...,â€� he claimed at a press conference at Amava temple soon after â€˜darshanâ€™ of Ram Lala. It was on July 4, 1997, when he had last paid obeisance to the presiding deity at the makeshift temple when his â€˜swarna jayanti rath yatraâ€™ had rolled into Ayodhya. Significantly, once hero of Ayodhya Kalyan Singh, who had dumped the temple issue after being thrown out of the party in November 1999, also had â€˜darshanâ€™ after a gap of over four years.

â€œIn the past 6-8 months, we have already made some quiet progress without giving any publicity to the formula being worked out. I am confident that we will be able to reach an agreement involving Hindu and Muslim representatives shortly after the new government is in place,â€� declared Advani.

The DPM emphasised that he was issuing this statement with full responsibility and that the NDA had no objections to the negotiated settlement. He also made it clear that Kashi and Mathura were not on the agenda of the ongoing talks with Muslim representatives.

Advani claimed that there was a perceptible change in the mindset of Muslims in the country. â€œIt would be no exaggeration to say that the principal factor in removing fear from their mind was good governance by the Vajpayee government in the last six years. Negotiated settlement would not only strengthen Hindu-Muslim bonds but also unity and integrity of the country,â€� he emphasised.

5,Choppers to help monitor elections,"HYDERABAD: In addition to the deployed forces, the police department will also have eyes in the sky to monitor the ground situation during elections.

The department will be using five helicopters to monitor the ground situation.

""These choppers will help us conduct surveys in naxalite-infested areas, particularly in remote areas and in deployment of policemen to these areas. They will also assist in thwarting naxalite attacks on any polling stations,"" director general of police S R Sukumara said.

The move is also expected to help police patrol the areas, where landmines may have been laid.

He was speaking at a meet-thepress programme organised by the Andhra Pradesh Union of Working Journalists (APUWJ) at the press club in Basheerbagh on Tuesday. He said that the Indian Air Force would provide five helicopters, of which two would be MI-8 choppers.

While an MI-8 can accommodate around 28 policemen, the ordinary choppers accommodate only about eight personnel. ""We decided to use the choppers by taking a cue from the Chattisgarh police who successfully conducted the Assembly elections last year by using the choppers.""

The DGP said that till now as many as 92 poll-related incidents have taken place in the state. Eleven persons were killed and 18 sustained serious injuries during various attacks made by naxalites.

Six landmines were unearthed in separate places. The police also seized 127 bombs, and 15 firearms including 10 company made and 5 country made weapons.

""It seems that the naxalites have planted land mines in interior and other main roads to disturb the peaceful conduct of the elections in the state. This came to light during an explosion of a landmine at Mahbubnagar district in which a couple of police personnel received serious injuries,"" Sukumara said.

The police have bound over 63,332 people under various sections for their involvement in criminal activities and 9,609 license holders have deposited their weapons with the police.

6,Poll time: jobless youths have a party!,"GULBARGA: Itâ€™s daybreak. Youths of Habal village slowly assemble either under a neem tree or at the playground. They chat, they argue, they joke, they laugh. There is commotion the moment they see a vehicle approaching. If a Congress flag flutters on the vehicle, some youths quickly pin the party badge on their shirts and turn into â€˜loyalâ€™ Congress workers while others wait for other parties to arrive.

Their job: Pasting posters, canvassing for the party, carrying banners. At the end of the day, they get paid for their â€˜loyaltyâ€™.

When this remote village was hit by drought, the jobless youths didnâ€™t pray for rain, they prayed for elections. And then they hit upon a novel idea. They decided to work for whichever party gave them odd jobs. In order to attract the attention of the parties, they decided to assemble at a strategic location. When they saw a BJP vehicle coming, the â€˜BJP menâ€™ among them would offer their services to the party. Similarly, the remaining youths would loyally work for other parties.

They have no party affiliations. They belong to all paying parties. Naturally, there are no clashes or rivalries. â€œWhy should we fight? Our aim is to earn money,â€™â€™ said Vijayakumar, who this time round has turned into a Congress worker.

According to Shivakumar, a rich farmer from the village, youths earn anything between Rs 50 and Rs 100 daily. â€œElections have provided work to these jobless youths,â€™â€™ he said. Kelsa beka? Then follow the Habal youthsâ€™ shining example. You will feel good...at least till the elections are over.

9,"Yet another minister quits, joins JD(U)","PATNA: Bihar minister of state for sports, culture and youth affairs Monajir Hassan on Tuesday quit the ministry and also membership of the legislative assembly in protest against alleged injustice meted out to minorities in the state by Rabri government.

He also announced his decision to join Janata Dal-U.

""The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo, Laloo Prasad Yadav, has been betraying minorities for more than a decade in the state. The state government has forced closure of several educational institutions, including medical and BEd colleges, which were opened for upliftment of minorities,"" Hassan said at a press conference here.

He maintained madarsa teachers are also facing starvation due to the state government''s apathy towards their problems.

""The state government failed to utilise Rs 250 crore allotted to it by the Centre for development of madarsas,"" he said.

Hassan criticised Laloo for not fielding adequate number of minority community candidates in the ensuing parliamentary polls in the state. ""Minorities constitute at least 18 per cent of the total population of Bihar. But Laloo spared only one ticket â€” for M A A Fatmi in Darbhanga,"" he said.

Hassan does not count RJD tickets to Mohd Shahabuddin for Siwan and Taslimuddin for Kishanganj as those to minorities. ""Shahabuddin wins election on his own while only a minority candidate can win election from Kishanganj,"" he explained.

Asked whether he would contest election from Munger, Hassan said if the JD-U leadership decides so, he would accept the decision.

Earlier too, two ministers, Poornamasi Ram and Chhedi Paswan, resigned from the Rabri government to contest polls on tickets of other parties. Another junior minister, Dadan Pehalwan, was dismissed from the government after he filed nomination papers as an Independent candidate from Buxar. Cabinet minister Shivanand Tiwari is the RJD''s official nominee from Buxar LS constituency.

10,All parties call for check on opinion polls,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission''s recommendations on regulation of opinion and exit polls are likely to be announced soon, before the first phase of voting on April 20, sources say.

On Tuesday, there was near unanimity at an all-party meeting convened by the EC on the need to regulate such polls.

At the meeting attended by the CEC, the two election commissioners and representatives of six national and 18 regional parties, the view was while opinion polls should not be conducted after poll dates are notified, results of exit polls should be made public only after the last phase of elections gets over.

Commission sources say many options are being probed. The SC''s 1999 order is being examined. Sources say the SC had not struck down the EC''s 1998 ban on these polls, but asked who would monitor it.

11,US rules out possiblity of 'stepping in' to Pak,"WASHINGTON: Appreciating Islamabad''s anti-terror efforts, United States has ruled out the possibility of ""stepping in"" to Pakistan''s tribal regions to crackdown Taliban and al-Qaeda elements as suggested by US ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad.

""I think that''s an eventuality that, fortunately, we don''t have to deal with at this point,"" State Department Spokesman Adam Ereli told reporters here on Tuesday.

Pakistan, in the last several weeks, have been doing concerted and courageous efforts against terrorists elements in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan, he said.

""We''ve had a good dialogue with Pakistan on the subject of moving against terrorist elements operating on their territory. These actions have involved the loss of considerable Pakistani life,"" he said.

Secretary of State Colin Powell had appreciated the efforts during his recent visit to the country, he added.

""It''s important to note that this is going to be an ongoing effort, that there are deep-rooted and committed terrorists in that part of the world who need to be acted against. Pakistan is doing that. We appreciate that and we''ll continue to work with them in any way that we can to help support that effort.

""It''s not a question of now or never, it''s a question of - we''re both in this for the long haul,"" he said.

The comments came a day after Khalilzad reportedly said US will have to ""step in"" with its troops if Pakistan failed root out Taliban sanctuaries, which prompted an angry reaction from Islamabad.

12,Now farmers decide to contest LS polls,"KOZHIKODE: Perhaps taking a cue from the hapless tribals, who recently decided to contest the parliamentary polls on their own, now it is the turn of the beleagured farmers, reeling under severe drought and facing recovery proceedings, to enter the poll arena in Kerala.

''Farmers Relief Forum,'' a state-level organisation, declared that it would contest at least two Lok Sabha seats-Kozhikode and Kannur, besides supporting independent candidates in the other constituencies, accusing both ruling UDF and opposition LDF of ""ignoring"" their interests and making ""false assurances"" at the time of elections.

""We will show to both the Fronts that the farmers can''t be taken for granted anymore by contesting the polls on our own notwithstanding the huge expenses involved for the campaign,"" Forum''s state General Secretary Thomas Kalappura told a press conference here.

Forum''s state Chairman A C Verkey would be the candidate for Kozhikode, while district Chairman Thomas Manakuzhi would contest from Kannur, he said, adding besides seeking the support of tribals, the Forum would also extend support to independents willing to support their cause in other constituencies.

On the recurring incidents of suicide by farmers owing to bank debts in Wayanad district, from where few assembly segments form part of the Kozhikode parliamentary constituency, he said the Forum would approach ""like-minded people from all walks of life"" to support them during the polls.

14,Ordinance banning exit polls in the offing,"NEW DELHI: An ordinance banning opinion and exit polls may be in the offing in the wake of a unanimous demand made by political parties, following which the Election Commission is understood to have written to the government favouring such a step.

The Election Commission, which had convened an all-party meeting on Tuesday, heard a unanimous demand for a total ban on opinion and exit polls till the last phase of polling.

EC sources said that the poll panel had written to the law ministry on Wednesday conveying the recommendations of the all-party meeting and its comments on the issue.

The sources said that the Commission had reportedly favoured suitable amendments in the Representation of People Act to ban opinion and exit polls.

Since the country was already in an election mode, there might be no option for the government but to choose the ordinance route as the issue had the support of all the parties, they said.

16,Prabhatsinh incident embarrasses BJP,"AHMEDABAD: The arrest of son and other family members of minister of state for cow protection Prabhatsinh Chauhan for violation of the prohibition law has put the BJP in an embarrassing position ahead of the Lok Sabha election.

Though Chief Minister Narendra Modi has sought an explanation from the minister, BJP spokesman Dhirubhai Shah, tried to defend Chauhan pleading that the police case implicated family members and not him. So there was no need for Prabhatsinh to own moral responsibility and offer his resignation.

Asked as to why the minister was not asked to resign even when he was involved in the multi crore co-operative bank scam in Panchmahals, Shah paused for a while and said charges have not been framed against him yet. To a query if the incident would cripple the BJPâ€™s poll prospects, he quipped, â€œI do not think soâ€�.

Shah said that in fact the firm action against the ministerâ€™s son would show that no one was above law and this would be viewed as the bold step of the government.

17,Brutuses preparing for political back-stabbing,"GANDHINAGAR/VADODARA: Just before the December 2002 assembly elections, Congress general-secretary Kamal Nath was talking to Ahmedabad party chief Rajkumar Gupta, persuading him to quit sulking and start campaigning intensively.

Gupta had been sitting at home even a week after the campaign began, mourning the fact that the Congress had spurned his bid for a ticket from Dariapur constituency.

Then Kamal Nath clinched the issue. He told Gupta, Why do you fret over a ticket, we are sure to form the government. I will ensure that you are adjusted somewhere.â€�

Kamal Nath never returned to Gujarat after the BJP swept the elections and Gupta is now the Congress candidate for the Ahmedabad Lok Sabha seat.

Had he sulked his way through the assembly elections, he would have classified been as a saboteur, someone who tacitly or explicitly ensures that his party loses. A look around the electoral arena in Gujarat shows the field packed with saboteurs.

In Kutch, Congress MLA from Anjar, Nimaben Acharya, has reportedly offered the BJP her support after she wrote a letter challenging Sonia Gandhiâ€™s foreign origin.

Ex-CM Keshubhai Patel thinks the Congress may suffer from sabotage in Dahod and Mandvi. In Dahod, seven-time Congress MP Somjibhai Damor has vowed to finish off the party. Another seven-time MP, Chhitubhai Gamit, is making life difficult for Congress Legislature Party leader Amarsinh Chaudharyâ€™s son, Tushar, in Mandvi.

In Sabarkantha, Congress candidate Madhusudan Mistry is wary of sabotage from no less a person than Amarsinh. Relations between the two have soured since Chaudhary brought down Shankersinh Vaghela from the post of GPCC president.

In Valsad, BJP insiders claim, they have the support of former Union minister Uttambhai Patel, who was denied a Congress ticket. The BJP leadership has served a warning to state minister Bavku Unghad,who is said to be working against Dilip Sanghani in Amreli. Incidentally, Unghad belongs to the Keshubhai camp while Sanghani is a Modi supporter.

State BJP campaign committee convenor Suresh Mehta admitted that some party leaders in Amreli were involved in sabotaging Sanghaniâ€™s campaign. The name of another Keshubhai supporter, Becharbhai Bhadani, is being mentioned in this connection.

However, adds Mehta, â€œWe are getting lot of help from the dissidents in the Congress.â€� In Bhavnagar, BJPâ€™s Rajendrasinh Rana does not have the full support of MLAs of the district.

Many eyebrows were raised when disgruntled workers from a factory run by Vadodara BJP candidate Jayaben Thakkarâ€™s family recently turned up at the Congress office, complaining that their salaries were being paid erratically. But pollsters felt this could be the handiwork of sulking BJP members.
