0,Shivani case: IGP's pre-arrest bail plea rejected,"PANCHKULA/NEW DELHI: An additional district and sessions judge in Panchkula on Tuesday declined to grant pre-arrest bail to Haryana inspector-general of police (IG) Ravi Kant Sharma, prime accused in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case.

The court, however, adjourned the hearing of his anticipatory bail application till August 10. Joint commissioner of police (crime) U K Katna said: â€˜â€˜There is no stay on his arrest till the hearing of the anticipatory bail application.â€™â€™

Although the Delhi police did not send a lawyer, a crime branch team was present in court. The application was opposed by lawyers for both the Haryana government and Shivani Bhatnagarâ€™s husband. Katna said: â€˜â€˜We did not send a lawyer on Tuesday because we do not have a locus standi till we receive a notice. But we had requested the Haryana government to allow our officers to brief their state advocate.â€™â€™

Katna, however, added that the Delhi police would be sending an advocate for the hearing on August 10. â€˜â€˜Whoever will give him (Sharma) protection till then will be arrested for harbouring an accused,â€™â€™ he said.

Sharmaâ€™s advocate cited the status of his client in his argument for anticipatory bail. His plea was strongly opposed by counsel for Shivaniâ€™s husband who stated that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application.

1,"Hooda, Barinder skip Haryana Cong rally","CHANDIGARH: The rally of the Haryana Congress held here to felicitate its new president Bhajan Lal, who formally took over on Tuesday, was by all standards an impressive show, but the absence of his arch rivals, outgoing president Bhupinder Singh Hooda and former HPCC president Barinder Singh, has once again proved that Bhajan Lal too will have to grapple with factionalism to establish his supremacy in the party.

Perhaps it was this realisation on their part that compelled AICC general secretary Mohsina Kidwai, former chief minister B D Gupta and former party MP Chirangi Lal Sharma, in their speeches to caution Bhajan Lal that running a government was one thing, and managing an organisation like the Congress another, which demanded considerable sense of accommodation and political skill so as to keep the party free from groupism.

Though Bhajan Lal and Kidwai stated that Hooda could not attend the rally due to the death of someone close to him, sources close to Hooda have, however,denied it.

As was expected, Bhajan Lal in his address assured the central leadership that he would see to it that his performance as the HPCC chief was up to the expectations of party president Sonia Gandhi and the party workers who had been facing the wrath of the present Chautala government for the last three years.

â€˜â€˜This rally is nothing but an alarm bell for the Chautala government, which has failed on all the fronts. People of the state are eager to get rid of it at the earliestâ€�, said Bhajan Lal, adding that he would see to it that the party stood united against the onslaught of the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD).

Claiming that the days of the Chautala government were numbered, he assured the retrenched government employees that as and when the Congress was voted to power in the state, they would be reinstated even if he had to get the law changed for the purpose.

In a scathing attack on the Vajpayee government, Mohsina alleged that the government at the Centre was the government of scams.

First it was the UTI scam and now it was petrol pump scam, said Mohsina, asserting that the mere cancellation of the allotment of petrol pumps would not serve the purpose, the government would have to bring to book those who had made crores of rupees in this scam. â€˜â€˜In fact, it will not be an exaggeration to say that there is hardly a government worth its name at the Centre. These people are yet to learn how to govern,â€� said Mohsina, asking Congress workers to be proud of the fact that they belonged to a party like the Congress.

Among others who addressed the rally were AICC secretary Hanumanth Rao, former MP Ranjit Singh, who is chief minister Chautalaâ€™s younger brother, former HPCC president Shamsher Singh Surjewala, deputy leader of the Congress legislature party Ajay Singh Yadav and Ranbir Singh Mohindra, who is former chief minister and Haryana Vikas Party supremo Bansi Lalâ€™s son. A party worker was heard commenting that the presence of all these leaders of various shades proved that Bhajan Lal might succeed in bringing about unity in the party.

3,"State to build 5,000 godowns to increaase storage capacity","PUNE: In a move aimed at giving farmers better price for their produce and guarantee availability of foodgrains throughout the year, the state government has started the process of constructing 5,000 godowns all over Maharashtra to create a storage capacity of 15 lakh tonnes in the next 15 to 18 months.

The godowns are to be constructed under the central scheme of Gramin Bhandaran Yojana, a plan that is being actively pushed by the state agriculture marketing board (AMB).

The basic objective of the scheme is to enable farmers store their produce to avoid distress sale due to lack of storage facility.

The consumers would also benefit as there would be lesser chances of price fluctuations, even in conditions like drought.

Interestingly, the state would not invest anything as the idea is to make beneficiaries build the godowns with subsidy from the central government and loans to be re-financed by the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (Nabard).

In Maharashtra, the beneficiaries eligible to invest in the construction of godowns would include the 272 agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs), taluka marketing co-operative societies, primary agriculture credit societies, individual farmers and even sugar cooperative factories.

The entire project would be co-ordinated by the state with the agriculture marketing advisor (AMA), New Delhi.

According to sources in the directorate of agriculture marketing, the Centre would give 25 per cent of the capital cost as subsidy, while the owners would be required to give a matching contribution.

The remaining 50 per cent of the project cost can be taken as a loan from any bank which, in turn, would be re-financed by Nabard.

The loan will be made available to the entrepreneur society at a low rate of 8.5 per cent and has to be repaid in 11 years with a yearâ€™s grace period.

Under the scheme, the beneficiaries have been given the flexibility of constructing godowns with storage capacity between 100 tonnes and 10,000 tonnes at the most.

But given the fact that construction cost of smaller godowns (upto 1,000 tonnes) is estimated to be Rs 2,000 per tonne, the AMA and state would rather encourage those bigger in size as the project cost comes down substantially.

Ram Kharche, director of agriculture marketing, while speaking to TNN, said he had already received 500 proposals for construction of the agri-godowns.

â€œMore than 20 meetings in as many districts all over Maharashtra have been held to invite farmers and co-operative societies to invest in the job of creating storage capacity for all types of agri-produce,â€� he added.

In fact, a meeting of 152 APMCs was held on July 31 in the presence of AMA officials from Delhi, he added.

Kharche said the AMA has assured the state that there would be no dearth of funds in case beneficiaries get the loan sanction to raise 50 per cent of the project cost.

â€œThe AMA has promised to release 50 per cent of the subsidy amount immediately to beneficiaries once a bank gives them a loan clearance letter,â€� he added.

4,"Patnaik drops 4, inducts 8 new ministers","BHUBANESWAR: After deferring expansion for months, chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday inducted eight new ministers and dropped four ministers from his two- and-half-year-old government. He went for a major reshuffle of portfolios. â€˜â€˜I would have taken more ministers, but for the drought situation in the state. This was done only to fill up the vacancies. There would be a bigger expansion in a few months,â€™â€™ Patnaik told newsmen after the swearing-in ceremony. The new ministers included four of cabinet rank, two ministers of state (MoS) independent charge and two ministers of state.

Amongst the new ministers, the coalition partner BJP has only one, Himanshu Sekhar Meher, MoS (independent charge), while the rest are from the BJD.

The expansion is widely viewed here as an attempt â€˜â€˜to calm down the growing dissension against the CM,â€™â€™ who had been holding nearly a dozen important departments with him and running the state through bureaucrats.

Though the CM said he would re-deploy the dropped m inisters in party work, few are willing to buy this.

The undercurrent of revolt came to the fore when Duryodhan Majhi (a tribal), one of the dropped cabinet ministers, accused him of being â€˜â€˜novice and inexperiencedâ€™â€™ and a â€˜â€˜prisoner of a caucus of vested interests.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜The CM hardly has any knowledge about the state and its people. This is a government comprising members from royal families and senior bureaucrats. The departments held by the CM are deeply involved in corruption. Now that I am no more in the government, I will expose the government left and right,â€™â€™ Majhi vowed.

Majhi, who held the department of information and public relations, reportedly earned the wrath of the CM when he said that â€˜â€˜Patnaikâ€™s ignorance of Oriya has been posing as the biggest bottleneck in the effective running of the government.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Every time you meet the CM he would send you to his secretary,â€™â€™ he had stated at a public meeting. â€˜â€˜I paid a price for being outspoken,â€™â€™ he added.

5,Samata MLAs differ on development funds,"PATNA: Sharp differences between the MLAs and MLCs of Samata Party seem to have surfaced over the demand by the assembly members that MLCs and Rajya Sabha MPs should give 50 per cent of their development funds for the schemes in the constituencies represented by the party MLAs.

A meeting of all three MLCs of Samata Party, Mangani Lal Mandal, PK Sinha and Vinay Kumar Sinha, held on Monday night rejected the demand and said they would put their views in the joint legislature meet on August 8. PK Sinha said the demand by the party MLAs was unjust and invited punishment for corrupt practices under section 171(b) of the IPC and also invited punishment under the People''s Representative Act.

The party MLCs also dubbed the show cause notice issued to P K Sinha by legislative wing chief Umashankar Singh and chief whip Shrawan Kumar as illegal, insisting that Sinha as the spokesperson was responsible to the party and not to the legislators.

7,Wait till Aug 15 for foodgrains: Centre,"BANGALORE: The Centre is yet to take decision on releasing foodgrains to the state, Chief Minister S.M. Krishna told the Assembly on Tuesday.

Replying to a discussion on the supplementary estimates for 2002-03, Krishna said: â€œIt has been raining in some parts of the country, including Karnataka.

The Centre has informed states to adopt the â€œwait-and-watchâ€™â€™ policy till August 15. We will wait till then before pressuring them for relief.â€™â€™

Announcing that the Centre had extended the last date for farmersâ€™ payment of premium from July 31 to August 31, Krishna said he had urged the Centre to increase corpus under the Central Relief Fund (CRF) at a meeting with Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee last week.

At the meeting of Congress CMs last week, the Centre was also urged to evolve a rural credit policy, specially for drought-stricken states.

â€œThe Centre will get back to us after August 15.â€™â€™

To a complaint from states that foodg rains lifted from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns were unfit for human consumption, the Centre had agreed to conduct a joint inspection, involving a representative from the respective state and one from the FCI, before lifting the foodgrains, Krishna said.

On power tariff: On the oppositionâ€™s demand that the government defer the power tariff hike in view of the drought, Krishna said a decision would be taken after assessing the situation.

â€œIt is vicious circle. If we have to get out of this, some unpleasant decisions should be taken.

Besides, the cost of power generation and purchase going up.â€™â€™

8,No teachers for Kolar law college,"BANGALORE: Imagine a law college not having lecturers from the same faculty.

And imagine the college principal being a post-graduate in chemistry. And again imagine the college functioning from the premises of another college.

The only law college in Kolar district â€” Government Law College â€” has this dubious distinction. And worse, the Bar Council of India (BCI) has accorded permanent recognition to it.

A Bangalore resident, with a masterâ€™s and a doctorate degree in chemistry, has been appointed a full-time principal of the college.

Two others â€” a lecturer in Kannada and a lecturer in historyâ€” are appointed permanent faculty members. The librarian is a commerce graduate.

The college is run in the library building of the Government Arts Science and Commerce College campus in Kolar.

Three rooms are earmarked for the law college â€” a principal-cumteaching and non-teaching room, classroom and store room.

The I and II year LLB classes are conducted in mathematics building of the main college, subject to availability of classrooms.

The college is affiliated to the Bangalore University. Data available for 2000-2001, reveals the law college, with an intake of 370 students with 23 parttime lecturers, majority of whom are practising advocates in Kolar.

Full-time teachers and the nonteaching staff are paid as per the government scales, whereas part-time teachers are paid Rs 75 for each period as per the University regulations.

Though the BCI has accorded permanent recognition, sources decry that the existence of the law college against BCI rules,which insists on appointment of at least a principal and four law teachers.

The State Council, expected to administer colleges in the state, has remained virtually toothless as it shall not do without the BCI permission.

As such, the State Bar Council, represented by V.T. Raya Raddi (former chairman), Abdul Reyaz Khan and Rajendra Desai inspected the college recommended closure.

The investigating team also complained of misuse funds by the college authorities. Representations were sent to BCI, governor, the chief minister, Education and Law Ministries.

â€œMore than a year has passed, but no action has been taken so far. This is showing on the legal education system of country and particularly on the apathy towards law students,â€™â€™ the team has charged.

10,I was able to control Gujarat violence: Gill,"HYDERABAD: Former director-general of Punjab police, K P S Gill, says he was successful in doing the job he was asked to by the Gujarat government: To control violence in the riot-torn state.

Addressing reporters on Monday, Gill, also known as Supercop, affirmed that he had been able to control violence in Gujarat. However, when pointed out that the National Human Rights Commission in its report had stated that Gujarat was not free of violence, Gillâ€™s reply was: â€œMy job in Gujarat was to bring about a cessation of violence there but heralding lasting peace there is the job of the civil society.â€�

13,Tehelka scribe arrested; released on bail,"NEW DELHI: Early Wednesday morning, Delhi Police arrested senior Tehelka scribe Anirudh Bahal in connection with a CBI complaint alleging manhandling by him, but was later granted bail by a local court.

In the morning, policemen from South district arrived at the office of Tehelka news portal to arrest Bahal and took him to the Lodhi Road police station where a senior official questioned him for an hour.

Bahal''s arrest came close on the heels of the Delhi police''s questioning of two employees - Ram Meher (guard) and Brij Bushan (accountant) -- of the portal at length in connection with the case.

The arrest came after CBI Deputy Superintendent of Police N S Kharayat, who is probing a case under the Official Secrets Act involving some scribes of the newsportal and Home Ministry officials, had alleged that Bahal had abused and manhandled him when he had gone to the Tehelka office in connection with the probe on Monday.

Police has registered a case against Bahal under section 186 (voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his public function), 353 (assaulting or using criminal force to any person being a public servant in execution of his duty) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

Later he was produced before Metropolitan Magistrate Reena Singh Nag, who granted him bail on a personal bond of Rs 25,000 and a surety for the like amount besides directing him to surrender his passport.

Emerging out of the court, Bahal compared the NDA-led government with Nazi regime and challenged them to prove charges against him.

Terming the complaint of CBI official as ""outrageous"" and ""concocted"", Bahal said ""this was yet another attempt by the government against us to teach us a lesson.""

Stating that he was shocked over the charges levelled by the CBI, Bahal claimed that he had been ""nice to the official and asked whether he carried any warrant or a notice to question the employees of the news portal.""

He alleged that the present government at the centre was ""very much vindictive in nature"" and was targetting the news portal employees ever since ""we broke the Operation Westend story.""

Kharayat alleged in his complaint that he had visited the office of Tehelka for questioning one of its employees in connection with the case and the appointment for the same had been sought on August 2, with the consent of Bahal.

""When I reached the Tehelka office, I was taken to Bahal''s room where he started hurling choicest of abuses against me, my organisation and our Director and later manhandled me,"" the complainant said.

The OSA case came after the portal put details of a secret and confidential meeting among the top government officials on its website as part of the funding story following which two Home Ministry officials had been suspended.

Bahal and another reporter of the portal Mathew Samuel have been questioned in this connection.

15,Cong rally in Surat may kick-start election campaign,"SURAT: Even though the scheduled rally by the Congress on Friday in the city, with likely participation of over 50,000 workers from different parts of South Gujarat, may kick start the election campaign for the coming Assembly polls, internal bickering within the party are threatening to embarrass the high command which seems keen to project the party''s image as a united one.

The lobby which openly revolted against former GPCC president Amarsinh Chaudhary and succeeded in bringing about a change in GPCC guard has caused much heart-burn in the party. But this successful ''coup'' in the state which installed Shankersinh Vaghela as the new GPCC president, seems to keep alive the hopes of several vested interest groups, say insiders.

According to political analysts, before the party gets its act together to gear up for Assembly elections, the party think-tank must take note of undercurrents through exercises aiming for practical alignment.

Take the case of division among textile traders in the city who not only represent numerical but economic strength to influence voting patterns. In the past fortnight, groups have exposed Congress claims of having made a dent in the BJP bastion, they say. Closed door meetings by some groups within the party are being seen as attempts to derail the party''s endeavour in projecting a united stand.

GPCC economic cell chairman Rupin Patchigar feels that the party needs to be strengthened.

However, the rally on Friday which is to be attended by AICC general secretary and Gujarat in-charge Kamal Nath, GPCC president Shankersinh Vaghela, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, leader of Opposition Amarsinh Chaudhary and many others is being considered as an opportunity to catch the attention of party big-wigs.

GPCC vice-president Kadir Pirzada, who is also the party co-ordinator, told TNN that differences among various sections no longer exist and the rally would be a success. When asked about divisions among textile traders over the issue of support to the rally, he said prejudices prevailed but would not prove damaging.

Interestingly, Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FSTTA) with representation of over 40,000 shops in 92 textile markets has decided to keep shutters open on Friday, according to FSTTA vice- president Dev Kishen Manghani.

17,Adequate money for drought-hit farmers: FC,"LUDHIANA: Putting the apprehensions of lakhs of farmers to rest, financial commissioner, revenue, Bhagat Singh informed the media here that there was adequate money for the droughtaffected farmers. He pointed out that the state already had Rs 230 crore in the kitty of National Calamity Funds left from the past year, and more was expected from the Centre for this year.

Replying to a query as to what would be the parameter to determine drought-affected and needy farmers, he said that a rather cumbersome process was underway to assess each farmer in each village of a particular area.

Giving the details, the financial commissioner said that a special girdawri would be taken up where a patwari in presence of sarpanch and lambardar of a village would personally check each farmerâ€™s land, the crop sown, and the gravity of the problem.

Singh informed that this team would further be supervised by tehsildar and naib tehsildaar, who in turn would be checked by the deputy commissioner. The commissioner was in the city to interact with all the deputy commissioners of the state to get an estimate of the loss in each district. He said that while an agricultural and rural committee under agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal was already reviewing the matter in detail, a further input would be gained through the next survey by the patwaris.

They would be making rounds in the state from August 10 to August 25, 2002. He explained further that during the survey the officers would look into problems related to drought, ground water in the area, rain water during the season, and tube wells, before adjudging the extent of damage in a particular area. This alone would decide the relief fund for the farmers, he maintained.

Considering that there has been 52 per cent less rainfall in the state, he said that there was scarcity of drinking water as well. For meeting this demand, he said, Rs 10 to 15 lakh had been assigned to the DC of each district, of course, that would depend on how grave the situation was in each district.

The movie, also starring Jyothika, will be released on August 22.

Indian cricket stars including G.R. Vishwanath, E.A.S. Prasanna, B.S. Chandrashekar, Javagal Srinath and Vijay Bharadwaj have already confirmed their participation. Sri Lankan cricketers Arjuna Ranatunga, Hasan Tilakaratne, Roshan Mahanama, Sidath Wettimuni and Roy Dias will also participate, courtesy SriLankan Airlines.

Vishnuvardhan''s film line-up is a who''s who of the present Kannada industry. All top heroes Upendra, Shivrajkumar, Ambarish, Ravichandran, Sudeep, Raghavendra Rajkumar, Puneet as well as heroines Bharati Vishnuvardhan, Sumalata, Prema, Tara and Rakshita will battle it out with India''s heroes for the `Nagara Haavu'' cup.

Movie producers Rockline Productions are promoting the film through the entry passes. ``The passes are in about 15,000 randomly selected Nagara Haavu audio cassettes. Those who are lucky enough to buy the cassettes with the passes will be permitted single entry into the stadium,'''' producer Rockline Venkatesh''s brother T.N. Bramaresha told The Times of India on Wednesday.

There are also plans to honour Chandrashekar, Vishwanath and Kapil Dev in the evening. Rockline Productions is planning to invite Chief Minister S.M. Krishna to do the honours, but this has not been finalised yet.

This is the second time in the recent past that film stars have turned cricketers. About two years ago, the Film XI played a benefit match to raise funds for Gujarat earthquake victims. Though this is the first time they will be playing genuine cricketers.

``We wanted an opportunity for people to see cricket as well as film stars. We thought it was a great idea to promote the movie,'''' Bramaresha said.

20,Punjab govt to decentralise powers to panchayat bodies,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government would decentralise powers in a big way to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) so that the elected representatives of people at grassroot level could participate in effective planning and solve their own problems. Stating this here after inaugurating a two-day workshop to create awareness amongst schedule caste sarpanches and panches, minister social security and welfare of schedule castes Santokh Singh Chaudhary said that PRIs would be given supervisory functions in various departments.

Also, in some some departments, even the functioning and budget itself could be transferred to PRIs, albeit in phases. The workshop organised jointly by the Institute for Development and Communications (IDC) and department of social welfare aimed to create awareness among schedule caste sarpanches and panches on their role and functions, about welfare schemes of the Centre and the Punjab government. The focus was on exposing the participants to the various constitutional safeguards, specially on â€˜â€˜Atrocities against Schedule Caste (SC) Act 1989â€™â€™ as most of the atrocities against dalits go unreported. Panches and sarpanches from Ropar district attended the workshop.

Choudhary said that Punjab government would ensure that the Special Component Plan was fully implemented. He said that there are about 3,400 villages - mostly in Doaba and Ferozepur - where the schedule caste population was more than 40 per cent. â€˜â€˜ our endeavour to ensure that all village-oriented development activities should start from these villages and schedule caste bastis are given top priority,â€™â€™ he stressed.

However, he conceded that some of the welfare schemes for the schedule castes were supported by adequate budgetary allocation. â€˜â€˜We are passing through a financial crunch and all these schemes would be taken on priority basis once the fiscal situation improve towards the end of the yearâ€™â€™, he added.

Emphasising the need for awareness, director IDC Pramod Kumar said that dalits face the problems of poverty, discrimination and lack of self-esteem which were the major hurdles. Though Punjab has higher per capita income and improved literacy yet over per cent of its poor are dalits and their literacy rate is far below that of the remaining population.
