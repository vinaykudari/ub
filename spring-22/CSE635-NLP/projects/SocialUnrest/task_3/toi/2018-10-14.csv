0,Private agency faces ‘trauma’ in govt hands,"kolkata: one of the first initiatives of the west bengal government to encourage private participation in health care is about to fizzle out. a private agency had been invited to set up a high-speciality trauma care centre in a government hospital, but the organisation found the government's conditions unacceptable. with this, the future of the project is uncertain. we are giving them our resources and in return we want some beds to be reserved for the government. the agency, however, refused to offer us beds. we had to cancel their initial proposal and asked them to revise it according to our conditions, said state health minister suryakanta mishra. we planned to set up good trauma care centres at nilratan medical college and chittaranjan national medical college and hospital, which the city lacks. we would have selected either of these two or may be both if the funds and plans permitted and had the negotiations succeeded, said health secretary asim barman. according to health officials, the land recovered in the recent eviction drive in hospitals was offered to a private agency involved in the health sector. health department sources revealed that the land was offered to asia heart foundation, with its headquarters in bangalore. the trust currently operates a cardiac super-speciality hospital at mukundapur, south 24-parganas. its main patron being dr devi shetty, the government thought he would be the best person run the project, said an officer. however, a section of city doctors have their reservations. why was no tender floated? on what basis was dr shetty offered the land? asked dr kaushik biswas, general secretary, medical cell of pradesh youth congress. rules were flouted and the government had to eat humble pie, biswas said. according to alok roy, the vice-chairman of asia heart foundation, the project is still at a rudimentary stage. we have not seen the land yet. before that, it is impossible for us to plan anything or offer any concrete proposal. there is no question of acquiring the land now. we expect to see the land later in the month and then decide about it, he said.

1,Opinion poll on Assembly polls raises heat,"lucknow: it was a day of accusations and counter allegations on saturday, as the bjp contested the credibility of an opinion poll on the forthcoming assembly elections that was published in some dailies on friday and the sp gloated on them. the bjp reacted sharply to the opinion poll findings and trashed the results as ""managed and manipulated"". this has been done at the behest of a ""poonjipati"" general secretary of a political party, tandon claimed. questioning the veracity of the poll which had shown samajwadi party as the number one party with 184 seats and the bjp a poor second with 102, the minister said he found the opinion poll ""biased and objectionable"" since it lacked credibility. rattled by the growing popularity graph of bjp, tandon added, political parties were trying to make a futile attempt to mislead the electorate. the minister also added that in times when the entire world was watching the horror of terrorism unfold, political parties were still politicking and indulging in partisan policies. in a separate statement, the state president of bjp kalraj mishra accused the poll pundits of being biased in favour of a political party and that the findings were unfounded when compared to ground realities. this opinion poll, mishra added, also suggested of a scenario that in case of an agreement between the bjp and bsp combine, then too it would not make it to the majority mark. ""though the question of either a pre-poll or a post-poll alliance with the bsp does not arise, the opinion poll is a mischief to cook up such a conjecture"", he added. however, reacting to the allegations hinting at him, sp general secretary amar singh said, ""the bjp had lost its sense of balance and proportion"" and were completely unsettled by the poll. ""i would not like to comment on the credibility of the opinion poll conducted by a private company and a newspaper,"" singh added and pointed out that the newspaper involved was owned by a congress mp vijay darda and was not from his party. ""only people with a conviction that they were in for a major upset at the hustings could make such wild statements,"" he said.

2,BJP's new mantra for coming polls,"lucknow: world's most wanted fugitive osama bin laden seems to have given the state unit of the bjp just what it needed so badly, it real issue which it could take to the electorate with certain elan. not surprisingly, chief minister rajnath singh while condemning terrorism sought the crowd's approval on the ban on simi at a number of rallies he addressed in farukkhabad, hardoi, saharanpur, bhadohi, hamirpur and ghazipur recently. a senior minister conceded that while the bjp considered the issue of terrorism a national and global problem, they would not be shy of ""playing it up if it brings along a windfall of votes."" in that light, samajwadi party's (sp) open support for simi has given the party a handle to beat the former with. the sp is now being propagated by the bjp as ""laden's party"". state bjp president kalraj mishra and urban development minister lalji tandon too have been making such noises in their interactions with the public. the vishwa samvad kendra -- an rss wing -- is launching a special issue of its magazine on jammu and kashmir coming monday in which rss leader hv sheshadri would take part. confirming that terrorism would be on the party's agenda in the forthcoming elections, rajnath singh said that in the post-october 1 (the day the j&k assembly was attacked by ultras) scenario the state populace was looking towards the bjp ""with great hope"". talking to times news network, the cm conceded that going by the massive response to anything that was ""laden and simi related"" in his rallies, there was no doubt that the state would see a sharp polarisation on these lines in the coming months. ""everybody now understands that we are as vulnerable as the people in kashmir and there is an immediate need to rise against such divisive forces. in such times, people, specially the middle class (backbone of the bjp's vote bank), was looking up to the bjp for decisive action,"" singh said. prime minister atal behari vajpayee's assertion in varanasi on thursday that india was mulling on ""all, including military, options"" to finish cross-border terrorism seems to be a step in this direction, party strategists say. urban development minister and senior bjp leader lalji tandon on saturday confirmed that terrorism indeed was the new brahmastra in the party's armoury as the state prepares for the assembly elections. the party, he added, would take the issue of terrorism and support by some political parties to the banned outfit -- simi-- to the masses in the forthcoming polls. ""the open assertion of the sp top brass, including mulayam singh yadav, that they would revoke the ban on simi if voted to power has exposed them,"" mused lalji tandon.

3,Naturopathy for Patel to regain political vigour,"gandhinagar: here is some news. keshubhai patel is now going to do something he has not done for years. he has decided to get physically fit and will soon proceed to the jindal-run naturopathy centre on the outskirts of bangalore to emerge ""fighting fit"". he will be back in a month-and-a-half to ""jump into active politics"" (read: to take the happiness out of the life of chief minister narendra modi). and in what can be described as tit for tat of sorts, sources suggest that modi has initiated a move to ensure that his predecessor is 'banished' from gujarat so long as he stays at the helm. keshubhai had ensured that gujarat remained out of bounds for modi for the last three years, when he ruled the roost. it is believed that the bjp high command is considering a proposal to send keshubhai to rajasthan as governor. ""things will move in this direction within two weeks after the ministry-making and portfolio allocation process ends,"" revealed a bjp source. the only stumbling block in the process, however, could be keshubhai himself. he has apparently decided to stay put in gujarat and, for the time being, take good care of his health. keshubhai has told close aides that he had neglected his health all these years and would like to return ""fighting fit"". it is known that during the operation in new delhi last month leading to his ouster, keshubhai was specifically asked whether he would like to go out of gujarat as governor or as national vice-president of the bjp. ""the talk about making keshubhai a governor or bjp national vice-president was there right from day one, when he was asked to step down,"" confirmed a cabinet minister. patel spurned the offers and told the bjp high command in no uncertain terms that he would not go out of gujarat under any circumstances. ""the party cannot force him to move out, like it did in the case of modi, because keshubhai is still an mla,"" pointed out a senior leader. what worries modi is that keshubhai has made it clear that he would ""take part in active politics"". he has decided to move into bungalow no. k-12, sector 19, next to k-11, the party office. k-11 was keshubhai's residence before he became cm in early 1998. the modi camp believes that keshubhai's interference may not be restricted to ministry-making and portfolio allocation, but may extend into in matters of governance as well. hence it would be better to keep him occupied outside gujarat. however, those in the corridors of power who know keshubhai say he is refusing to go accept the offer of governorship more as a bargaining chip. keshubhai knows that if he agrees to get out of the state forthwith, that would undermine his role in ministry formation. before being sent out, therefore, he wants to make sure that his men enter the new ministry. already, indications have emerged that some of those whom modi did not want to induct into his ministry may have to be allowed in. keshubhai is making it known to aides that he would like to ""rest"" for three months, go in for a ""thorough medical check-up"". once he feels better, and by which time modi would also have settled into the groove, he would be back in business.

4,Land cases cost govt heavy,"hyderabad: if the government decides to regularise the revenue lands under illegal occupation and in litigation, hyderabad district will get no less than rs 1,000 crore from the scheme. the decision to regularise the encroachment had been pending for long and the government had constituted a cabinet sub-committee to study and recommend the procedure after reviewing the urban land ceiling act. in hyderabad district alone, more than 1,000 acre land is under litigation and about 5,000 cases are pending in various courts including the supreme court. land worth crores of rupees is under illegal occupation in bits and pieces at various localities in the city. the district administration had been spending crores of rupees in court cases and administrative expenditure to regain the control over the land. the officials have secured a special software package exclusive to monitor the court cases. once the decision to regularise the encroachments is taken, the officials will be relieved from the protracting court cases and physical verification. the revenue officials are finding it difficult to evacuate the people who have occupied the valuable land. at several places, either constructions have come up or slums. when the officials tried to evacuate the poor from the land near ramanaidu studios, they faced stiff resistance from the public and several organisations. the action of officials was questioned by many who accused them of manhandling women. when contacted hyderabad collector rajeshwar tiwari said the procedure to be adopted for regularisation would be decided only after the cabinet sub-committee submits it recommendations to the government. the time frame and method to be adopted will be decided later, he said. in rangareddy district too, about 3,000 acres of land is estimated to be under illegal occupation. as many as 1,000 cases are pending in various courts. land in the district particularly on the city outskirts has lot of demand from the individuals and builders since many companies are coming up.

5,Crisis of confidence over Modi's by-election?,"ahmedabad: close aides of the chief minister have been scouting around the state for a safe seat to enable him to enter the state assembly through a by-election, even as the state congress has started speculating that an early election. bjp sources said an indication about where modi may like to contest from may be available when he expands his cabinet in the middle of this week. topping the list of likely seats from where modi may like to contest are sarkhej and ellisbridge seats of ahmedabad. sources said the mlas representing these seats, amit shah and haren pandya, are also tipped to become ministers in the first expansion which is likely to be held this week. modi may like to induct both these mlas into the ministry, but if one of them gets left out it will be only because modi has chosen to contest from that seat. the opposition is, however, confident of ambushing him wherever modi chooses to contest from. in fact, gujarat congress president and leader of opposition in the assembly amarsinh chaudhary has predicted that if modi is not too sure of victory, he might go in for mid-term poll. elections are due in gujarat in march 2003, and the congress feels that the dates could be advanced by one year. chaudhary said not a single seat out of 182 seats in the legislative assembly was safe for the new chief minister, and the congress will put all stops to defeat him. chaudhary believes the congress is on a roll after victories in the two recent by-elections to sabarkantha and sabarmati, the results of which brought about a change in the leadership in the state. besides, with the congress having won the panchayat elections decisively last year, even the rural constituencies were no longer safe for the bjp. says madhusudan mistry, who recently won the sabarkantha lok sabha seat for the congress, ""there is a crisis of confidence in the bjp after the defeats. if modi loses a by-election, it may well be the end of his political career. but if he holds early assembly election, it will not be so much of a personal loss because he can still blame it on the legacy of keshubhai patel."" bjp sources, however, said that though about 10 mlas have so far offered to vacate their seats for the chief minister. a decision on where modi would contest from will be taken shortly as he is required to get elected within six months. the party is aware that this is a difficult task considering the party's losses in the elections of late. another seat which is being actively discussed is unjha in mehsana district which has remained a traditional bastion for non-congress parties. it is significant that this will be modi's first entry into active electoral politics. and though he has successfully handled election campaigns for the party in the past, it is yet to be seen how he himself fares at the hustings. bjp sources ruled out the possibility of early elections and said modi would strive to turn the tide by giving real performance to the people over the next 18 months. one bjp leader said: ""why would modi recommend dissolution of the assembly early when he has the time to turn the tables on the congress.""

8,VRS tycoons not govt creations,"hyderabad:the state government is compiling data on the success stories of employees who had opted to take the voluntary retirement scheme (vrs) from stateowned public enterprises. it proposes to highlight these success stories to motivate employees of other sick units to opt for vrs and educate them about the 'brighter side' of it, according to official sources. but the most interesting aspect is that none of the people whose success stories are being collected was trained by the government under its safety net programme. it may be recalled that the government is planning to launch a campaign to locate about 4,000 employees who had sought voluntary retirement but whose whereabouts are not known. the success stories range from people opening mirchi bajji centres to owning a forging unit. the list of success stories includes employees of republic forge company (rfc) who opted for vrs when the company went sick. several of them established forging units at patancheru and cherlapalli and running successfully. there are stories of employees of fisheries corporation running a fast food centre at tank bund in hyderabad successfully while another employee of the same corporation launched fish wholesale marketing unit at kakinada. similarly, an employee of the cooperative spinning mills at rajahmundry started a mirchi bajji shop in front of the closed mill. while encouraging entrepreneurship, the department of public enterprises will provide specialised training in 35 different skills that would help the employees who opt for vrs find an alternative livelihood. business accounting is among the subjects that has found greater favour with the employees according to the implementation secretariat, an autonomous body of the state government. however, it is interesting to note that the major success stories that are available with the secretariat relate to those who had not been trained by the government under the safety net programme.

15,PU dues pile up due to govt apathy,"patna: the patna university senate has taken a strong exception to the reported indifference of the state government towards the revision of the university's statutory grants since 1979 and payment of its dues to the tune of rs 21.36 crore accumulated during the period. presenting the annual budget of the university for the next financial year (2002-03) at a meeting of the pu senate held here on saturday under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor k k jha, pro-vice-chancellor jitendra singh, pointed out that due to non-revision and non-payment of the statutory grants for the last several years the university was unable to pay the dues of the electricity bills (rs 15.35 crore), municipal taxes (rs 2.38 crore) and undertake repair of dilapidated university buildings and ensure proper functioning of its libraries and laboratories. the senate approved a rs 81.30 crore deficit budget for 2002-03. the government's indifference to the university's exercise of formulating its annual budget became quite apparent as none of the ex-officio member from the government side bothered to attend the meeting, opined some of the senators. the officials of the higher education and finance departments happen to be the members of the senate. the senate elected amar nath singh and bharti s kumar (history), ramesh kumar and phulena rajak (bihar college of engineering) to the syndicate from the teachers' constituencies. jitendra sahay, d k isser, mahabir das and rajniti prasad were elected to the syndicate from the non-teachers' constituencies. four teachers, namely, santosh kumar (engineering), akhileshwar prasad (science), vinod kumar singh (medicine) and jayadeo mishra (arts and commerce) were elected to the academic council of the university. addressing the senate, jha highlighted the various academic and development activities of the university during the last one year. he thanked the principals of the colleges for making financial contributions to the university for updating the provident fund account of teachers and non-teaching staff. he said vocational courses under self-financed schemes were being introduced for raising the internal resources of the university. some members of the senate expressed their grave concern over the deteriorating law and order condition in the university and urged the district administration to take immediate steps for improving the situation. prominent among those who participated in the deliberations included g k chaudhary, bharti s kumar, r s arya, l n sharma, jagannath thakur and p n pal. the senate also approved a supplementary budget for the newly started degree courses in information technology and computer science and engineering at the bihar college of engineering. it also passed admission ordinances for b ed, m sc biotechnology and women and child welfare education courses. the annual report was presented by y d prasad. earlier, a section of students tried to disturb the meeting, but the police chased them away.

16,Mega mart to boost farm products export,"gandhinagar: the new bjp dispensation headed by chief minister narendra modi is contemplating on a proposal to set up a mega market for inter-state trade and export of value-added agro products, including high-quality groundnut, castor and fruits like mango and banana, green vegetables and medicinal herbs like isabgul which have good potential in west asia and europe. the proposed infra-structure to sell and export agro products under one roof has been recommended by the expert committee on strengthening and developing agricultural marketing set up by the government of india. this committee has in its report to the centre has suggested setting up of at least 50 mega markets in joint ventures as growth centres, mostly export oriented, along with agri-park nearer to sea and air port and production catchment zones. and two such markets have been sanctioned for gujarat. the union government will provide financial support of rs.500 crore for each market project under which several agriculture park, godowns, cold storage and food processing units will be created for organised marketing of agricultural commodities through a network of regulated markets. experts committee chairman shankerlal guru who hails from unjha in north gujarat having the country's biggest agricultural marketing yard made a strong representation to the new finance minister nitin patel and pleaded that the government should give a serious thought to the proposal as such infra-structure of marketing was crucial for gujarat as its agricultural production was to reach whooping rs.25,000 crore once the narmada project was commissioned. now the state's agricultural production is around rs.10,000 crore but because of non-availability of any marketing network the state`s export is negligible as compared to other states like punjab, uttar pradesh, himachal pradesh and haryana. a three-member committee set up by former chief minister keshubhai patel has made some preliminary study on the proposal. nitin patel who was then entrusted the job told tnn ""we have already studied the suggestions made by the committee for making agriculture economy more vibrant through innovative approach and the state government would take some concrete decisions on the basis of the experts committee report"". the state government, he said, would also sympathetically consider the plea made by guru that all agriculture produce market committees under agriculture department for smooth implementation of new programmes on strengthening of agriculture produce sector. the apmc federation functionaries have requested chief minister narendra modi to decide on the issue soon in the larger interests of the farmers. the karnataka government has made changes in the act and brought apmc under the control of agriculture department. under the proposal farmers will get more remunerative prices for agriculture produce as the committee has recommended that 'allow direct purchase from farmers at his place without licence and government should facilitate rather than control and regulate market system'. the committee has also suggested scrapping of essential commodities act and review of 27 other acts to make them enable free trade and competitive system as in south africa by amending and adapting it to india. the other important recommendation is that 'agriculture, co-operation, food, pds, and consumer affairs should be converged by bringing a convergence bill as proposed in case of prasar bharati, it and communication.

21,Carrot-and-stick policy for industries,"bangalore: in an effort to promote environmental-friendly industrialisation, karnataka will soon introduce incentives for all categories of industries if they adopt ``cleaner production'' techniques. karnataka is the first state in india to set up a cleaner production centre (kcpc) exclusively to develop and propagate pro-environment processes in industry. ``we want to promote the concept further by asking all fresh industry to look at the cleaner production options that we have come up with. we will give incentives like instant clearance from the karnataka state pollution control board (kspcb),'' industrial development commissioner g. gurucharan told the times of india. presently, on an average, it takes about four months to get a clearance from the kspcb to start an industry, even if the entrepreneur has all the required documents. according to industrial representatives, the clearance also essentially involves ``greasing of palms'' so adoption of the cleaner production techniques suggested by the industries department would reduce this time span and the ``hassle'' of going through the kspcb. besides pollution clearance, the kcpc has suggested that financial institutions like karnataka state finance corporation (ksfc) and small industries development bank of india (sidbi) be asked to finance only those projects which are willing to adopt cleaner production techniques. ``we are looking into how feasible this is,'' gurucharan, who also chairs the kcpc governing council, said. the kcpc has been concentrating on low-cost cleaner production measures in existing industries in chemical, food processing, textiles, electroplating, foundry and pharma. ``new industries can put in expensive new technology for cleaner production, but we are optimising resources in the existing industries and showing them how cleaner production saves money for them also,'' kcpc project co-ordinator r. srinivas explained. kcpc has 10 on-going projects, while one project on electro-plating at peenya has successfully saved the small scale unit rs one lakh per month through the cleaner production techniques. ``each project has an individual audit done and different measures are drawn up. at a mango pulp making unit on the kolar-andhra pradesh border, we are aiming to reduce the number of points where mangoes are washed and optimise the use of water,'' srinivas said. cleaner production techniques are also being applied to the unorganised sector like the makers of mondakki (puffed rice) in chitradurga district. ``they use rubber tyres as fuel which is causing immense pollution. we are working with teri to demonstrate gasifiers and promoting the use of smokeless chulas among them,'' srinivas added.

22,Rains douse protest fire,"kolkata : the sudden cloudburst around mid-day on friday may have caught the pedestrian unawares, sending him scurrying for cover, but it certainly saved us president george w bush and british prime minister tony 'bel-air' (as blair was referred to) from being ceremoniously burnt on lenin sarani, in the heart of kolkata. however, the rain could not prevent agitated people from the minority community gathered outside tipu sultan mosque, from beating the effigies of the two leaders with slippers and tearing them into pieces. a peaceful demonstration was staged outside the mosque after midday prayers, against what the assembled people called american terrorism in afghanistan. plainclothes policemen mingled with the crowd as rumours were rife that the demonstrators would raise pro-laden slogans and march with his photographs. though the crowd abstained from any such activity, it was clear from the speech of md nooru rahman barkati, imam of the mosque that the sympathies of the city's minority population lay with laden and the taliban regime. the americans have not produced any concrete proof against laden. if they do manage to get some proof, laden will be tried in an islamic court. the taliban can never hand him over as he is a guest in that country. we do not want jehad but will be forced to fight if america continues to terrorise the muslim world, barkati said. in his opinion, the rss wanted the taliban regime in afghanistan crushed as they had plans to build a temple there and l k advani was in the forefront of its activities. how can rss be allowed to continue with its activities when a students'organisation like simi was banned, he said. i am sure that the hindus will lead the forces of secularism. more than 80 crore indians are against america's terror attacks on the taliban. pakistan has already sold itself to usa but india should not do the same, he said. he also reminded those present that muslims had played an important role in the country's freedom struggle and in wars against pakistan and thereby should be considered as much a part of the country as the hindus.
