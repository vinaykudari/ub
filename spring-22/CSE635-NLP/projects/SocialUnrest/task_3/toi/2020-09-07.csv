0,School teachers not paid since June,"PATIALA: The teachers of the schools upgraded during the last year of Badal regime in Punjab are waiting for their salaries since June this year.

It may be noted that the government has not sanctioned drawing and disbursing (DD) powers to the heads of such 1406 schools during the current financial year, but for the first quarter of the year, the district education officers (DEOs) in the state, using their powers, had released salaries to the teachers for the month of March, April and May this year, but they could not release the salaries for the next three months.

The teachers of Complex Schools attached to the recentlyupgraded schools are also facing the same problem. According to Jagwinder Singh Grewal, a spokesman of the Democratic Teachers Front, the teachers were facing this situation due to the wrong policies adopted by the government. He said that under the policy of the government, the posts of newly upgraded schools were put under the category of Plan posts for a period of five years from the day of upgradation.

For the Plan posts, the government releases the budget and DD powers for every three months while earlier all this was done at least for one financial year, he added. Jagwinder Singh further disclosed that instead of releasing the budget and DD powers in advance, the concerned authorities usually issued necessary orders after the specified period.

He demanded that the old pattern should be revived immediately and till then the budget and DD powers should be released before every effective quarter and the teachers should be given their salaries every month regularly. He also demanded each school should be considered as an independent unit and DD powers must be given to the school heads.

1,RSS fought against Nizam’s rule: BJP,"HYDERABAD: Lashing out at Left-wing parties, the BJP state unit has refuted allegations that it was trying to appropriate credit for liberation of the erstwhile Hyderabad state by organising celebrations on Sept. 17 to mark the occasion.

Talking to reporters on Sunday, BJP state vice-president S V Seshagiri Rao wondered how Left-wing parties could comment that BJP had not participated in the armed struggle against the Nizamâ€™s rule.

Rao categorically stated the RSS and other allied organisations too had participated in the struggle against the Nizam. â€œEven Guruji M S Golwalkar, despite being underground at the time, had played a pivotal role in the movement by rallying people,â€� he said.

Party state unit president N Indrasena Reddy said Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani would inaugurate the memorial for the martyrs the Parkal mutiny, who fought against the rule Nizams at Parkal in Warangal district on Sept. 17 and later participate in the Liberation Day celebrations.

He said statues of the heroes the independence struggle for the integration of the Nizamâ€™s state with the Indian union would be installed in various villages in the area.

Reddy said many of the people who had gathered Parkal on Sept. 2, 1947, hoist the national flag had died at the hands of the Nizamâ€™s soldiers. A souvenir would be published containing details of the martyrs.

2,Vibrant Gujarat: No clarity yet investments,"GANDHINAGAR/AHMEDABAD: Though it is less than three weeks to go for the much-hyped ''Vibrant Gujarat'' business summit, no details are yet available on expected investments or participants from abroad for an event that has so much at stake for the state and Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

A top CMO official said that it is ""still too early to say who will participate"". Another official''s statement was even more vague. ""It would be wrong to quantify likely investments because Vibrant Gujarat isn''t meant for that,"" he said.

Officials of FICCI,which is partnering the government in organising the event, too are tight-lipped. Its Gujarat director Dipankar Roy claimed that FICCI is only a facilitator and its main responsibility is co-ordination of logistics. ""Our job was to promote the event,"" he told TNN.

FICCI''s joint director M Y Reddy said, ""Investment-related matters are being dealt with by Crisil and iNDEXTB.""

Though 140 projects to be offered to participants were unveiled in August, there is no clarity on the number of inquiries. The government, on its part, has decided to bring out a tourism policy on the eve of the event for which the final touches were given on Saturday.

CII (Gujarat) chairman Piruz Khambatta said, ""Most of the interest is expected only in key infrastructure areas of oil and gas, roads, ports and telecom.""

State industries minister Anil Patel said that the summit might do away with the ""competitive route"" for setting up infrastructure projects. As part of the new industrial policy, Gujarat might return to the old method of offering projects to chosen developers.

The thinking is running strong in the corridors of power that the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act''s build-operate-transfer law applicable after competitive bids is a ""hurdle"" in attracting investment in the infrastructure sector.

But despite the ""change"" in emphasis, efforts are on to ensure signing of projects with the Dahej special economic zone project (SEZ) â€”one of the main attractions â€” already seeing nine developers coming forward to show ""expression of interest"".

""The SEZ, a risky proposition for a foreigner, would be developed by an Indian partner at a cost of about Rs 1,500 crore. It would be complete with infrastructure, township, power plant and effluent treatment facility,"" an official said.

An industry source said, ""One doesn''t know how many will actually invest after all this hype. Its success will largely depend on GoG''s post-event follow-up action and initiative taken by entrepreneurs."" But Hasmukh Adhia, the additional principal secretary to the chief minister, insists that there is considerable misconception about the event.

""There will be delegations from all over the world but it will be more of an information exchange house with discussions, surveys, acclimatisation with Gujarati culture and interaction with local enterprises. If one believes that there will be announcements on investment, he is wrong,"" he said.

Back from the US and Canada, Patel sought to draw a parallel with a festival where many couples meet. ""It is not necessary that all those who meet will marry. In fact, you can never say right away when the marriage will take place either.""

But industry sources maintain that it is mainly NRGs and NRIs that have either evinced interest or confirmed their participation and the same could not be said about foreign investors.

Meanwhile, efforts are on to tap every NRG source for participants. The Gujarati Hindu Samaj of Paris has been asked to rope in the chambers of commerce of the French capital and Versailles.

A Canadian firm that has shown interest in investing in pharmaceuticals has been asked to bring along its proposal, and Chinese businessmen in Hong Kong have been showcased sponge iron and ceramic projects in Kutch.

There is also a lurking fear that early announcements about participants may jeopardise Gujarat''s interest competing states Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra might ""lure"" potential investors away.

""There is back-to-Bangalore fever California,"" admits Patel. ""In Australia, I was told mine was the first presentation on Gujarat. Other states, particularly Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, have already made a dent,"" added Adhia.

3,State govt cool to cola firms’ offer,"HYDERABAD: The best-laid plans of Coke and Pepsi to sponsor the Afro-Asian Games in Hyderabad next month may come to nought with the state government in no mood to accept their offer.

The two soft drink companies reportedly wanted to sponsor the games after the Centre for Science and Environment found that their soft-drinks contained pesticide levels far in excess of European Union norms while conforming to Indian standards.

The prestigious games, involving athletes from 98 countries, would be an ideal vehicle for the two companies to launch a charm offensive, and they reportedly communicated their interest to some top officials.

This was their first attempt to sponsor any sport other than cricket.

But official sources told The Times of India that the government is unlikely to let itself be associated with the two companies while a probe by a joint parliamentary committee is going on into the pesticide controversy.

The state government is going ahead with its plans to raise funds for the games. It is planning to get about Rs 30 crore from public sector undertakings and Rs 10 crore from the Indian Olympic Association.

This would be part of the Rs 103 crore promised by the Centre, which includes Rs 63 crore as grant. The state government will mobilise another Rs 15 crore to fund the games.

President A P J Abdul Kalam will attend the opening session and Prime Minister Vajpayee will grace the closing ceremony, as per current plans. There is also a move to invite some â€œthought leadersâ€� from Africa.

The government has appointed Wizcraft, a Mumbai company as event managers for the Afro Asian Games, sources said.

Nearly 400 additional troops of Gorkha Rifles and JKLF were pumped into operation on Sunday to increase the strength to nearly 700 troops alone, the sources said adding CRPF, police and VDCS are also part of this operation.

""There was no firing from the side of militants till this morning for the third consecutive day today,"" the sources said and added militants were still holed up but lying low to target security forces.

10,Minister blames opposition for farmers' suicides,"BANGALORE: Cooperation minister H Vishwanath on Monday blamed the opposition for the spate of farmers'' suicides in the state.

""Instead of appreciating the government''s efforts in trying to tackle the drought situation with the Rs 880 crore package, the opposition has been degrading it. This has only demoralised the farmers and pushed them to end their lives,"" he told reporters here.

Taking a veiled dig at former PM H D Deve Gowda for trashing the package, Vishwanath retorted: ``It does not behove a former PM to behave like a village hoodlum. He should not stoop to that level. It is not healthy either for him or for politics.""

The minister appealed to people to come forward to help the state''s farmers in their time of need. ``In Andhra Pradesh, noted personalities from all walks of life as well as common people, have begun donating in cash and kind for farmers. I urge the people of our state to do something similar,"" he added.

11,Gujarat riots: SC notice to Modi govt,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to the Gujarat government and the Dahod police administration on a petition by a woman belonging to a minority community saying the police had closed her case despite she was raped during the unprecedented Godhra violence in 2002.

A Bench of Justices S Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur asked the concerned authorities to reply to the rape victim''s allegation that her criminal complaint was closed. A final report was submitted to the Limkheda magistrate on technical grounds that her statements were contradictory.

The petitioner was one of the women who were raped by a mob on February 28, a day after the Godhra train carnage.

She said: ""A group consisting 17 Muslim men, women and children including the petitioner from Limkheda taluk of Dahod district were trying to escape the mob, which was targeting the members of minority community.

""However, the mob cornered them at a secluded place near village Panivela and gang-raped and killed most women.""

She was pregnant then when gang raped. ""I was left to die by the mob,"" she told the Supreme Court.

Petitioner''s counsel Harish N Salve said that it was unfortunate that ""such a heinous crime was being pushed under the carpet by the Gujarat police.""

The police filed a closure report for the case before the Limkheda magistrate saying that

there were contradictions in the statement of the victim even when the medical examination of the victim had confirmed commission of rape, Salve said.

Earlier in April, National Human Rights Commission chairperson A S Anand had rendered legal aid to her and appointed former solicitor general Salve and former Supreme Court Bar Association secretary Ashok Arora to represent her before the court.

In her statement to the NHRC she said:``On Bakra Id, I along with my husband and daughter had gone to visit my father for a few days at village Singwad Randhikpur. After the Godhra train carnage, a lot of violence had broken out all over the area and Muslim area were targeted by the majority community.""

Her statement, which was incorporated in the NHRC order on April 29, 2003, also said:``I too was caught by the miscreants and raped. ...I found dead bodies of our group scattered all around. The culprits were to be found nowhere.""

She had named the rapists to the police. She was medically examined also.``I knew the rapists because they belong to my village,"" she said.

``Apart from the physical and emotional trauma that I have undergone and am still suffering, there has been a gross violation of my basic human rights and also my right to live with dignity,"" she had told the NHRC after she failed to get justice from the Gujarat government.

She said:``I have also come to know that the police in its to the court had passed comments and made certain observations and accusations against me. These comments and observations directly questions my integrity and credibility and also affects my right to life and dignity.""

Disgusted with the state police and humiliated by others who were supposed to heed to her complaint, the victim moved the NHRC saying: ""The sensitivity and the sincerity of all the members of NHRC delegation at the relief camp have given me a hope that some day I will get justice.""

She also said ""I have no confidence in the functioning of the local police, the sincerity of the investigation as well as the functioning of various state machineries and functionaries.""

On the victim''s plea, Justice Anand asked NHRC chief rapportuer P H J Nampoothiri to assist the victim ''to pursue legal remedies in her case.''

12,Gujarat not to relax prohibition policy,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has decided not to give any relaxation in the state''s prohibition policy.

A top-level meeting called by Chief Minister Narendra Modi to have a look into the state''s new tourism policy decided to set up at least special entertainment zones on Gujarat coasts, international small townships along the Narmada canal, develop eco-tourism, proposed to bring down sales tax concessions for tourism and travel from 12.5 to four per cent and proposed abolition of the luxury tax.

However, on the crucial question of prohibition, the CM is believed to have made it clear that there could be ""no relaxation"" to the local Gujaratis. Even for those coming from outside the state, mainly foreigners, a better system of informing them on how to get liquor permits should be developed. ""They should be able to get the information at airports and luxury hotels. They should also be able to get permits easily"", said a senior Sachivalaya official participating in the meeting.

The state proposes to hardsell 18 tourism related projects at the Vibrant Gujarat summit worth 3,495 crore. But before these projects are offered to the investors gathered at the big show from September 28 to 30, the state wants the new tourism policy be announced so that those willing to invest do have a clearcut idea of what the state has to offer.

Insisted the CM, there was a ""tremendous potential"" to propagate Gujarat''s culture by developing projects at religious places like Dwarka and Somnath. Even while wanting on having a cruise service along the sea coast, he said, a museum of Gujarat''s ships could be developed, he added. The last tourism policy, put out in 1995, attracted just Rs 1,278 crore of investment till March 2003. ""The government to attract Rs 10,000 crore of investment in the next 10 years under the new tourism policy"", an official said.

At the Vibrant Gujarat summit, special entertainment zones at Ahmedpur-Mandvi, Kutch-Mandvi and along Surat-Navsari coasts are proposed as a major attraction. ""It may attract Rs 400 to Rs 1,000 crore"", an official said. But the just put out document to be distributed at the summit makes no mention of the zones. It just talks of a theme part at Dumas near Surat, and beach development at Gopnath along Saurashtra coast and a tourist corridor taking tourists from Dwarka to Marine National Park.

The Vibrant Gujarat document mentions building a Jurassic Park at Balasinor, pointing out its ""eco-tourism potential is huge."" Two corporate-cum-retreat golf courses are proposed at Hazira and off Vadodara expressway as there is a ""need for recreational entertainment centre for entertaining business guests, expatriate workers in MNCs and families in executives. Then, the archaelogical sites at Dholavira and Lothal are proposed as attractions to Indus Valley ramnants.

13,KPTC seeks reintroduction of incentive scheme,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation (KPTC) on Monday sought permission from the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) to reintroduce an incentive scheme to lure back high tension consumers.

Making a case before the commission, KPTC chairman K.N. Shrivastava said an incentive scheme, providing consumers with power at Rs 3.50 per unit, existed earlier but had now been discontinued.

""As a result, many of the consumers have turned to captive generation. We propose to regain them with a similar scheme rated at Rs 3.80 per unit for a consumption of one lakh units,"" he stated.

The KERC, however, reserved its order on the matter. An order is also awaited on the KPTC''s earlier request for a general power tariff hike to meet a revenue gap of Rs 500 crore. The KPTC had submitted that due to bad monsoons, the availability of hydel power had dropped, thereby necessitating purchase of power from costlier sources.

15,No other minister involved in stamp racket: Goud,"HYDERABAD: No other minister from the state Cabinet was involved in the multi-crore stamp racket involving former minister and TDP legislator C Krishna Yadav, said home minister T Devender Goud.

Reacting to rumours making rounds that some ministers were also involved in the racket, the home minister said that the director general of police and the Maharashtra minister has clarified to the government that no other minister was involved in the racket.

The state CID had no information about the involvement of Krishna Yadav in the racket till the tapes surfaced, the minister told reporters on Monday.

Devender Goud said the police of Karnataka, AP and Maharashtra were coordinating with each other in the case. He refuted the charges that the police did not act on the case even though a case was booked in 1990 and said that he is ready to furnish all the details of the case.

On the issue of leaders with criminal antecedents in the party, the home minister said that action would be taken on such leaders, if their involvement in criminal activities were found. ""We have acted swiftly and had suspended Krishna Yadav from the party,"" he said.

When pointed out by some reporters about Krishna Yadav contributing nearly Rs 80 crore to the party fund, Devender Goud reacted strongly and said: ""no one can this type of questions.""

The home minister also urged the people to cooperate with the police in peaceful and smooth conduct of the Ganesh immersion on Tuesday. He appealed to the people not to heed to rumours and the police has taken all necessary steps for the smooth conduct of immersion.

There was a slight increase in deployment of police force compared to last year, Devender Goud added.

16,Contestants gate crash freshers' party,"CHANDIGARH: Forget about the traditional ways of campaigning, pleading for votes from classrooms to classrooms. Rather catch hold of the vote bank where one can address majority at one go.

In the latest mantra of extending the voter base, the best way the student political parties campaigning for the students elections seem to have found is gate crashing into the freshers parties organised in different departments, mingle with the students, raise party slogans and use is as an image building exercise.

Though much to the chagrin of the students themselves, five minutes are reserved for slogan shouting which otherwise has nothing to do with the celebrations. Moreover the news of celebration of any departmental function spreads instantly, starting a rat race among the parties.

Merely the presence alone does not matter in such parties but its the competition to be the first one to approach too. So when on Monday it was the turn of the Botany department to welcome the freshers to the department, the event turned into a political race for the contestants, who are desperately trying hard to represent students of the campus.

""The PUSU and SOPU activists have already reached the department and are raising slogans. We have to rush,"" announced the ABVP activist at his campaigning tent and in no time the huge cavalcade of cars and jeeps decked up with party posters reached the spot to meet students and raise slogans.

""The fresher parties are the easiest way of campaigning as the real target of the student organisations are the first year students. So what better can be than making way into a party and make your presence felt,"" said Neha of M Sc II of Botany department though added that many regard it an obstruction in real celebrations.

The election of the department representatives on the same day of the elections to the students council is another factor, which makes the politicization of simple departmental activities conducive.

""The candidates standing for the post of DRs have a backing of some party and they are the ones who make it a point that leaders presence is ensured. That ensures their campaigning too,"" said Deepak Verma, a university student.

The mood of the entire campus is focused on elections and talk about who would win dominate all other conversations. It is not department specific but all departmental gatherings have a political colour.

``Even the party thrown for the first year students of chemical engineering departments, the slogan shouting and party inclination was very much a part of it,"" said a student of department of chemical engineering.

17,2 students injured in Pre poll violence,"CHANDIGARH: In a pre-election clash between two rival groups in SGGS college, sector 26, two students were injured when they were attacked by activists of another political party within the college premises on Monday.

The clash began when the activists of Khalsa College Students Union (KCSU) attacked Chandigarh students union (CSU)â€™s presidential candidate Kranti Chopra with rods and bricks. Kranti has sustained injuries on head, ear and superficial injuries all over the body. The incident on Monday is said to be a sequel of the clash between the same groups on Sunday night when they had fought in sector 22.

While Kranti is the CSUâ€™s candidate, the other boy was attacked just within minutes of the first attacked. The eyewitnesses say that after brutally beating up their rival candidate they approached another boy who had come to collect his detailed marks sheet and pounced on him mistaking him to be another CSUâ€™s supporter. The agitated students could only be calmed down by the intervention of a few faculty members.

Within minutes of the outbreak of the incident, the police was called and the students were arrested. The two injured students were rushed to general hospital sector 16, where their condition is said to be stable.

18,NBA evolves stringent rules for colleges,"BANGALORE: In a move aimed at enhancing the quality of higher education specially in professional colleges, the National Board for Accreditation (NBA), an apex body of the Human Resource Ministry has evolved stringent procedures for these institutions to be rated by the board.

Henceforth, it will either be accredited or not accredited. ""We had the system of giving them ranks and points. But we felt that a course or programme in a college is either good or bad. There is nothing in between. So, the rating should be done accordingly,"" NBA member N.R. Shetty said.

Unlike the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), which does quality assessment for institutions, the NBA accredits programmes or courses of each institution.

This is to ensure that a student does not go by the rating of the entire institution, but is only concerned about the course he/she is interested or wishes to pursue.

Sadly, the response from Karnataka colleges to apply for self-assessment has been poor.

According to the NBA, of the 115 engineering colleges only 20 are accredited. ""Somewhere there is a fear that they may not perform well in the eyes of these regulatory bodies. So, many college managements refrain from being assessed,"" Shetty noted.

To top it, there are some private agencies, which rate some institutions very high. But the NBA''s accreditation process does not restrict itself to cut-off percentage and the year of inception of the college. They concenterate on the quality of the academic programmes offered.

With these regulatory agencies relating approval and disaffliation to accreditation, it seems to be a perform-or-perish situation for our institutions.

â€˜â€˜We had information regarding the accusedâ€™s presence in Seemapuri area. The police team nabbed him late on Sunday night,â€™â€™ said additional deputy commissioner of police (east) Alok Kumar. He added that the accused had joined the nursing home a year ago. The victimâ€™s father, a tailor by profession, claimed his daughter was still unwell. â€˜â€˜Her speech is incoherent and she is unable to get up,â€™â€™ he said.

He also alleged that the nursing home had initially refused to treat her but was forced to after their neighbours protested on Sunday. â€˜â€˜The nursing home staff informed me late. They called me up at 9 am after they found my daughter was lying unconscious inside one of the bathrooms which was locked from outside,â€™â€™ he claimed. When he reached there, the victim was sent to Guru Tegh Bahadur hospital (GTB).

After a medical examination, the GTB officials sent her back to Shanti Mukund where her family members were reportedly asked to take her back. â€˜â€˜My neighbours went there and protested following which the nursing home agreed to take care of my daughter.â€™â€™ When asked, Kumar said, â€˜â€˜I was not informed about this.â€™â€™

The nurse was allegedly raped by Bhure on Saturday night. As per the nurseâ€™s statement to the police she was at the hospital as a private nurse taking care of an 80-year-old patient. On Saturday night while the victim was taking care of the patient, the accused entered the room and allegedly dragged the nurse out. When she resisted, the accused beat her up and injured her in the eye. After assaulting her, the accused locked her inside a bathroom. The nurse was found by one of the staff members early on Sunday morning.

20,Smuggled wine can sour party,"NEW DELHI: Guess who came to dinner at the first birthday bash of MG-1, Delhiâ€™s elite designer store, on Friday? A little before midnight, Delhiâ€™s excise department officers gatecrashed the party to arrest the storeâ€™s estate manager B S Rawat for serving smuggled French wine to the cityâ€™s whoâ€™s who.

As the high profile guests made a quiet exit, the officers stayed back to confiscate 48 bottles of premiere Cuvee Borie Vin De Table Francais wine.

According to the first information report (FIR) (number: 422/03, dated September 6, 2003) lodged at Mehrauli police station, Rawat was booked for violating the provisions of the Punjab Excise Act that prohibit Delhiites from serving smuggled liquor at parties. A senior excise officer said MG-1 had obtained L-49A licence (number: 9216) from his department to serve 72 bottles of beer and 39 bottles of Indian-made wine and hard liquor. â€œIn the application, Rawat indicated that he would buy this stock from the government-owned liquor vend at Saket. But we found they were serving wine that was not purchased from the city vends,â€™â€™ he said.

â€˜â€˜By the time we raided the place, the guests had drank 24 bottles of the French wine. An equal number of unopened bottles were found on the bar counter,â€™â€™ said the officer. By the excise law, Rawat, now out on bail, faces three years of imprisonment if the charges are proven. Smuggling of foreign liquor is rampant in Delhi. â€˜â€˜We suspect liquor is stolen from embassies or makes way from duty-free shops to the grey market,â€™â€™ said an officer. Possession of liquor purchased from neighbouring states or foreign countries without the payment of excise duty is illegal.

21,UP govt for goondas: Union minister,"NEW DELHI: The Union minister of state for home, Swami Chinmayanand, thinks that a civil confrontation-like situation prevails in UP.

â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s all because of the politics of revenge,â€™â€™ he says adding that the class of people who were at the receiving end during Mayawatiâ€™s reign, are now flexing their muscles not only to bounce back to political relevance at the grass root level but also to hit back at their alleged tormentors with a vengeance. â€˜â€˜Earlier, it was a government by goondas; now itâ€™s a government for goondas.â€™â€™ That is the only difference, he says.

The swamiji looks worried on yet another account. â€˜â€˜This new government in Lucknow will crumble under its own weight sooner rather than later because of its inherent contradictions,â€™â€™ he says adding that all â€˜â€˜erstwhile enemies have become friends in an alliance of convenienceâ€™â€™. Without taking names he was making an oblique reference to the new troika â€” Mulayam, Kalyan and Ajit.

â€˜â€˜The BJP will do well in the coming election because of the performance of the Vajpayee government,â€™â€™ he said.

24,SC summons Gujarat govt on rape issue,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to the Gujarat government and the Dahod police administration on a petition by a woman belonging to a minority community, alleging that the police had closed the case pertaining to her rape during the unprecedented violence in 2002.

A Bench of Justices S Rajendra Babu and GP Mathur asked the authorities to reply to the rape victimâ€™s allegation that her criminal complaint was closed and a final report was submitted to the Limkheda magistrate on technical grounds that her statements were contradictory.

The petitioner was allegedly one of the women raped by a mob on February 28, 2002, a day after the Godhra train carnage.

She said: ""A group consisting of 17 Muslim men, women and children, including the petitioner, from Limkheda taluka of Dahod district was trying to escape a mob targeting members of the minority community. However, the mob cornered them at a secluded place near Panivela village and gangraped and killed most women.""

She was pregnant when she was gang-raped. ""I was left to die by the mob,"" she said in her petition. Petitionerâ€™s counsel Harish N Salve said it was unfortunate that ""such a heinous crime was being pushed under the carpet by the Gujarat police"".

The police filed a closure report for the case before the Limkheda magistrate saying that there were contradictions in the statement of the victim even when the medical examination of the victim had confirmed that she was raped, Salve said.

Earlier in April, National Human Rights Commission chairperson AS Anand had rendered legal aid to her and appointed former solicitor-general Salve and former Supreme Court Bar Association secretary Ashok Arora to represent her before the court.

In her statement to the NHRC, she said: ""On Bakri Id, I, along with my husband and daughter, had gone to visit my father for a few days at Singwad Randhikpur village. After the Godhra train carnage, a lot of violence had broken out all over the area and Muslim areas were targeted.""

She said: ""I was caught by the miscreants and raped... I found bodies of our group scattered all around. The culprits were nowhere to be found."" She had named the rapists to the police and was also medically examined. ""I knew the rapists because they belong to my village,"" she said.

""Apart from the physical and emotional trauma that I have undergone and am still suffering, there has been a gross violation of my basic human rights and also my right to live with dignity,"" she had told the NHRC after she failed to get justice from the Gujarat government.

She said: ""I have also come to know that the police, in their report to the court, had passed comments and made certain observations and accusations against me. These comments and observations directly question my integrity and credibility and also affect my right to life and dignity.""

The victim had moved the NHRC saying: ""The sensitivity and the sincerity of all the members of NHRC delegation at the relief camp have given me a hope that some day I will get justice."" She also said: ``Obviously I have no confidence in the functioning of the local police, the sincerity of the investigation as well as the functioning of various state machinery and functionaries.''''

On the victim''s plea, Justice Anand had asked NHRC chief rapportuer P H J Nampoothiri to assist the victim ""to pursue legal remedies in her case"".

25,"As polls near, politicos play footsie with celebrities","MUMBAI: The induction of noted sports administrator Rajsingh Dungarpur into the BJP on Sunday is of a piece with the growing trend of luminaries cosying up to netas, and vice versa.

Mr Dungarpur seems to have taken a cue from billiards champion Michael Ferriera,who recently called on Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray ostensibly todeliberate on how to give billiards a leg-up in Mumbai. The meeting triggered speculation that Mr Thackerayâ€™s well-known visitor had been tipped for the Rajya Sabha.

â€œThere is no need to see red if leading sports personalities join active politics or become members of the Rajya Sabha,â€™â€™ said former cricket captain Ajit Wadekar. â€œTheir presence in parliament will mean a lot in terms of policy-planning and the release of more funds for the countryâ€™s sports.â€™â€™

The Congress flagged off the celebrity circus in 1984 with the vivacious Vyjayantimala and superstar Amitabh Bachchan winning Lok Sabha seats. The 1970sâ€™ screen sensation Rajesh Khanna made a belated entry, declaring his â€˜Amar Premâ€™ for New Delhi voters as the Congress nominee for the Lok Sabha.

Not to be left behind, the Sena-BJP also closed in on the sports-entertainment industryâ€”and the â€˜Ramayana-Mahabharataâ€™ soap operasâ€”to keep its Hindutva vote-bank jingling. Deepika â€˜Seetaâ€™ Chikhalia,Nitish â€˜Krishnaâ€™ Bharadwaj and Arvind â€˜Ravanaâ€™ Trivedi basked in the BJP limelight. Film star Govinda, on the other hand, is said to be a staunch Congress supporter.

The BJP recently nominated danseuse-actress Hema Maliniâ€”whose â€˜Seeta Aur Geetaâ€™ and â€˜Andaazâ€™ continue, it is learnt, to delight the Prime Ministerâ€”as the Rajya Sabha member.

She will join the likes of thespians Shabana Azmi, whose term ended last month, Lata Mangeshkar and Dilip Kumar, who have served in the house of elders. Ahead of the state assembly elections in Maharashtra, the Sena-BJP combine seems all set to win over the Page Three crowd.

The Sena, which paraded Dada Kondke, popular Marathi actor-director, at its Dussera meetings in the 1970s, can now boast of a list of VVIP admirers, including Ms Mangeshkar and Sachin Tendulkar.

The BJP has Bollywood heavyweights Shatrughan Sinha and Vinod Khanna on its side. The Big B, on the other hand, is busy doing a tango with the Samajwadi Party.

Mr Bachchan and his family recently attended the swearing-in of Mulayam Singh Yadav as Uttar Pradesh chief minister in Lucknow. â€œFrom all accounts, the ruling DF coalition, which the Congress Party heads, is on a weaker wicket as Maharashtra readies for the assembly elections,â€™â€™ a senior civil servant said.

â€œLittle wonder, then, that the glam-sham brigade is worming its way into the saffron camp.â€™â€™ The celebs are learning the rules of the game as well.Mr Dungarpur, after formally joining the BJP, offered politically-correct soundbytes to the media.

â€œMy adulation and appreciation for Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and my total faith in the BJP have prompted me to join the party,â€™â€™ he said.

26,High court restrains Roshans' arrest,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday restrained the police from arresting film-maker Rakesh Roshan, his actor-son Hrithik and father-in-law J. Omprakash till September 22, in alleged cheating cases, and deferred their plea seeking to quash a lower court order directing the police to probe these cases.

Justice Ranjana Desai and Justice V.M. Kanade took on record the reply filed by Jayantilal Gada of Popular Entertainment Network (PEN) that filed six cases against Roshan Sr, Hrithik and Mr Omprakash for cheating. Mr Gada alleged that the Roshans and Mr Omprakash had committed breach of agreements with regard to merchandising of films.

He prayed that the HC had no jurisdiction to hear this matter under Article 226 of the constitution. Four petitions filed by the Roshans and two petitions filed by Mr Omprakash will be heard together on September 22. Earlier, the HC had suggested the parties should go for an out-of-court settlement.

Accordingly, they met on August 6 but could not work out a compromise and decided to follow the legal course. The Roshans were represented by lawyer Dipesh Mehta while Ashok Sarogi appeared for Gada. The Roshans had entered into agreements with PEN for merchandising their films.

Omprakash also entered into agreements with the same company for marketing films made by him. However, dispute arose over payments. The petitions urged the HC to quash criminal proceedings against the Roshans by Mr Gada, managing director of PEN.

They also urged the court to stay the proceedings and restrain the Khar police from arresting them. The petitions also sought quashing of an order delivered by a magistrate in Bandra in May directing the police to probe the complaint of alleged cheating and criminal breach of trust registered against them.

According to the complaint filed by Mr Gada, the Roshans had entered into a contract with his company for film and TV merchandising rights for Hrithik''s first film â€˜Kaho Na Pyar Hai'' and all forthcoming home production films.

However, the Roshans and their company, Film Kraft Productions (India), did not honour the contract. The complainant alleged that his company had spent crores of rupees in creating a market for Hrithik but the Roshans and their firm had backed out of the contract and began dealing with parties directly.

The Roshans, however, claimed that they had terminated the agreements with PEN early this year for alleged breach of contract and failure to make the payments for TV telecast rights.

The petitions alleged that the matter was of civil nature and the magistrate had erred in ordering the police to investigate the complaints against them.

The petitions contended the magistrate had failed to appreciate that PEN had right of merchandise only for a period of two years, which ended on April 24 last year.

The Roshans alleged that complaints had been filed against them to pressurise settlement with the respondent.

27,RSS for polls in Feb-March,"NEW DELHI: The Sangh Parivar feels that the next general elections should be held either in February-March or on schedule, in September next year. Madandas Devi, joint general secretary of the RSS and ''''in-charge'''' of the BJP, said: ''''The choice of the date of elections is very limited - either February-March or September next year.''''

He says the RSS also wants the BJP to fight the next elections on its own agenda with cow slaughter, Ram Janmabhoomi, Article 370 and uniform civil code as the poll issues. ''''There are other issues also. We will discuss the additions to this agenda with the BJP leadership only after the coming assembly elections,'''' Devi told The Times of India in an interview.

Though the Sangh has made a major generational shift in its organisation, it does not foresee any such change in the government. ''''We have towering personalities in the government, in whom we have great pride. Leadership in the Sangh is like the flow of a river. It cannot be created artificially,'''' said Devi.

He distanced the RSS from the editorial in its weekly Panchajanya that welcomed Mulayam Singh Yadav coming to power in Lucknow. ''''The editorial policy of Panchajanya is not determined by the Sangh, it is the prerogative of the editor. There was no alternative for the BJP other than allowing Mulayam to come to power,'''' said Devi.

Devi explained that Mulayam is still not acceptable to the RSS. The difference of opinion, according to him, is over the Ram Janmabhoomi issue. Yet, Devi said everything would depend on Mulayam''s attitude to the issue. ''''We will request that he does something to resolve it.''''

In terms of choosing a social coalition between the ''''other backward castes'''' represented by Mulayam, Kalyan Singh and the Apna Dal, who have gained power now, and Dalits represented by Mayawati''s BSP, the RSS leader said the Sangh Parivar has no preference. He said an alliance with one section does not imply disharmony with other sections of society.

But he clarified that the BJP has no alliance with either of the sections now. ''''The BJP is now standing aside, without getting into either group or getting involved in the clash that is taking place.''''
