0,"Courting muse, artists clash with ‘visa’ villain","BATHINDA:Punjabi artists here and those whose children are settled in America have yet to recover from the spinoff of the 9/11 WTC attacks. Gurdev Singh is a retired police officer here whose two sons are well-settled in America for the last ten-twelve years. Both sons are green card-holders and Gurdev Singh and his wife Baljeet Kaur visited them a number of times before the tragedy of September 11 last year.

The parents used to visit their sons in the US every year but during the last one year they tried for visa three times but the American embassy refused it each time.

Similar fate has befallen telefilm and documentary artists who had made a number of attempts for visa to America to shoot a film which is pending for the last one year.

These artists have visited the US a number of times in the past for shooting films but post-September 11 the visa has become almost like a mirage.

One woman stage artiste told that she visited the US at least ten times and toured a number of European countries during the last five-six years. â€˜â€˜I was never denied visa in the past but after 9/11 the American embassy turned down my request for visa without giving any reason,â€™â€™ she told.

An employee in Punjab State Electricity Board told that he gave surety of his agriculture property worth Rs 50 lakh to impress upon the authorities at the American embassy but he was denied a visa without mentioning any reason. â€˜â€˜I tried three times but all attempts proved futile,â€™â€™ said the employee.

A studio owner here invested about Rs 30 lakh to purchase a D-35 camera which was to be hired by a Jalandhar-based company for shooting a documentary in the US but for the last three months the camera is lying idle for the company is not being granted visa for the US.

Fearing that their name appearing in newspapers would further slim their chances of getting a visa, those who were interviewed felt that their resemblance with the Afghansâ€™â€™ (in Americansâ€™ eyes) explains the authoritiesâ€™ reluctance to grant them visas.

1,Lawyers to protest on September 18,"CHANDIGARH: Lawyers all over the country will abstain from work in courts and judicial offices on September 18 after the Bar Council of India, in its meeting on September 7, unanimously resolved to mark it as `National Protest Dayâ€™.

Chairman of the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana Dr Anmol Rattan Sidhu told newspersons, on Tuesday, that the call had been given to lodge the protest of the lawyersâ€™ community against the amendments in the Civil Procedure Act (CPA) and the Legal Services Authorities Act (LSAA).

Members of the Bar are upset over the fact that amendments are against the interest of the litigants, and that the apex body of lawyers, the Bar Council, was not consulted and its recommendations not considered while making the changes. The meeting, which was attended by chairman DV Subba Rao and chairmen and members of all the state bar council and presided over by the Attorney General Soli Sorabjee, resolved that if the government did not withdraw the amendments, the Bar Council will meet again on September 28 to decide on the future course of action.

The Bar Council of India has protested against the implementation of amendments in the LSAA Act-2002 since it will reportedly take away the jurisdiction of the consumer courts and many of the services are covered by Consumer Protection Act and Motor Vehicles Act. Chairmen of various Bar Councils were of the view that this will reduce the credibility of the judicial system. A decision was also taken to contest the amendments in the Supreme Court.

2,"Paud police arrest 3, solve murder cases","PUNE: With the arrest of three people, the police claimed to solved two murder cases and a robbery attempt which took place last one year.

Paud police station inspector Arun Walture said the bodies found in both the cases were in a naked condition.

Thus, it became difficult for the police to ascertain their identity. Giving details, Walture said one Rahul Jagtap, who hailed from Latur, use to work at a factory in Pirangut and reside in Lavule village Paud taluka.

Santosh Chandikar, who is currently absconding, also use to work in the same factory. However, Chandikar suspected that Jagtap used to complain against him to the factory owner.

In September 2001, Chandikar, along with his friends Dattatraya Banekar (35), Sandip Deokar (23) and Navnath Allhat (29), hatched a conspiracy murder Chandikar.

Under the pretext of going for a movie, the four took Jagtap to a secluded place outside his village, slit his throat and banged his head with a stone. They then removed his clothes and belongings.

In January last, the gang murdered one Amir Pansare, a resident of Lavule village, and threw his body in a well.

As the well was quite far from the village and covered with bushes, the body was found only on February 7. Land dispute is believed to be the reason for the murder.

â€œAs we were not able to establish the identity of both the corpses, it became difficult to arrest the culprits.

However, we received information about the suspicious movements of the gang. We kept a vigil and after interrogation, they confessed to have committed both the murders,â€�Walture said.

He said Jagtapâ€™s parents are still not aware of his murder and the â€œdifficult task of conveying it to them has fallen upon usâ€�.

The gang also attempted to loot a salesman at Sus Pass in October last. In the ensuing scuffle, the salesmanâ€™s son received stab injuries on the chest. But as the gang saw some people approaching, they fled from the scene,Walture added.

3,"No annual exams for class IV students, says govt","MUMBAI: The state government has decided to cancel the annual school examination for Standard IV students and instead conduct only a state-wide board exam, education minister Ramakrishna More said on Monday.

The board exam will be held in March-April. The Congress-led Democratic Front government is going ahead with the board exams despite Congress president Sonia Gandhi asking chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh to reconsider the proposal. City Congress chief Murli Deora on Monday reiterated his appeal to Mr Deshmukh to scrap the board exam.

The board exams will assess not only a studentâ€™s performance but also that of the teachers, Mr More said. Students will not be given any marks for this exam, he added. â€œStudents will be promoted to the next class on the basis of the average of the marks they score in the three unit tests conducted by the school authorities,â€™â€™ he told journalists at Mantralaya.

The contentious issue of conducting exams for Std IV students was discussed at a high- level meeting chaired by Mr Deshmukh. Mr More, along with school education secretary J.M. Phatak, and other senior state officials attended the meeting. â€œThe state has taken a policy decision to go ahead with the board exams. At Mondayâ€™s meeting, we discussed the issue once again and decided to cancel the annual school exams,â€™â€™ Mr More said, adding that the proposal will be tabled before the state cabinet for its final approval.

Though the stateâ€™s decision to hold board exams has been opposed by Mumbai-based academicians and Parent Teachersâ€™ Associations (PTAs), the state authorities defended their stand.

â€œIt is not an examination to determine the studentsâ€™ ranking in terms of marks. It is an attempt to assess their performance in the last four years of primary school. In many cases, particularly in the rural pockets, we found that many of the students are not familiar with the basics even after having reached Std IV. This exam will ensure a proper evaluation of the studentsâ€™ learning and also assess the teachersâ€™ performance,â€™â€™ a senior Mantralaya official said.

The decision is unlikely to appease parents and teachers, who emphasise that itâ€™s the board exam that should be done away with. â€œThe very fact that itâ€™s a board exam creates fear psychosis among students,â€™â€™ said Arundhati Chavan of the PTA United Forum,which has sent a legal notice to the state government about the issue.

Ms Chavan said that certain schools had even demoted students so that they can get good results in the board exam. The Forum would be going ahead with its litigation plans to force the government to withdraw the board exam. â€œWe will file a public interest litigation next week,â€™â€™ she added.

4,Cable operators protest police harassment,"LUCKNOW: All the five cable operators in Gomtinagar went on a flash strike from Monday evening following alleged high-handedness and misbehaviour of the Gomtinagar police at the instance of the family members of an additional superintendent of police (ASP) posted in an adjoining district. The strike was called off on Tuesday evening on the intervention of the senior superintendent of police.

Reports said that Vardhan Vision cable operator in Gomtinagar had a subscriber residing at 2/175 in Vivek Khand at a monthly charge of Rs 180. This subscriber happens to be the family of an ASP. However, when the workers of the cable operator went to this subscriber on Monday to collect the monthly charge they were offered only Rs 150. When they asked for more, they were allegedly threatened of dire consequences.

The workers allegedly snapped the connection of the subscriber which led to a heated argument. later, Gomtinagar police reached the office of the cable operator and allegedly misbehaved with the woman owner which led to the strike.

5,Leakage of WB letter: Govt probe inconclusive,"LUCKNOW: At a press conference last week, chief minister Mayawati had announced that she was instituting an inquiry into who passed on the World Bank letter to this newspaper. The report submitted by the one-man inquiry panel suggests that investigations have apparently run into a dead-end.

According to unconfirmed sources, the inquiry has absolved Brijendra Yadav, the former agriculture production commissioner, of the charge that he could have passed on the letter to The Times of India.

As the World Bankâ€™s letter was addressed to the chief secretary and the agriculture production commissioner and the director, EPW, the suspicion was that it was Brijendra who could have obliged the newspaper.

However, it was found that he hadnâ€™t even opened the letter. The inquiry then narrowed down to the director, diversified agriculture centre. Here, the copy of the letter was found at a place where it was not originally kept making the officer a suspect.

The inquiry then ran into a roadblock created by frequent transfers. The department has had two directors in a short period of time.

The problem thus lay in finding out which of the two directors could have done it. So far as the inquiry is concerned, who dunnit still remains a mystery.

The letter, which was published by this newspaper, had taken exception to frequent transfers of officials.

6,Fate ruled that they live,"KOLKATA: As many as 177 people narrowly escaped death when they either missed the train or chose to cancel their tickets at the last moment.

Among them was former MP and Bihar Peopleâ€™s Party leader Anand Mohan, who missed the train because he got delayed while giving interviews to the media.

â€œTwo local Hindi newspapers were interviewing me on Monday. I did not realise that it was that late. By the time the interview was over, the train had left,â€� Mohan said. Interestingly, Mohan missed the Rajdhani Express even on Tuesday as he was busy giving interviews to the media on his providential escape.

Like Mohan, Atanu Ghosh and Aloke Samanta, both air-conditioning mechanics, were scheduled to travel on the train but were too ill to travel. â€œI was ill, so I could not travel,â€� said Ghosh. Likewise, an indisposed Samanta chose not to travel at the last moment. There were other politicians travelling by the ill-fated train who also survived. BJP North Dinajpur district secretary Utpalendu Sarkar, his wife and two party colleagues were travelling on AS II but escaped with injuries.

Other politicians on the injured list are Hamidur Rahman, Congress MLA from Chopra in North Dinajpur and former CPM MP from Howrah Sushanta Chakraborty. They have been reportedly admitted to Gaya Hospital.

8,Nitish rules out resigning over disaster,"GAYA: Railway minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday afternoon ruled out his resignation in the wake of one of the worst-ever train accidents, in which more than 100 passengers of the Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express are feared to have been killed.

Talking to TNN at the Gaya railway hospital, Nitish said that he cannot take moral responsibility for, what, to him, appeared to be a case of sabotage. However, he was not categorical about the sabotage theory. He said that prima facie, it appeared to be a case of sabotage as the driver of the ill-fated train has said that the train bumped before taking theplunge. Explaining the phenomenon of the engine going ahead of the breaking point on the bridge, Nitish said that the sheer momentum of the high-speed train may have pushed the engine and the first two coaches far away.

However, he qualified his statement with the observation that only the inquiry conducted by the Commissioner of Railway Safety would establish the real cause of the accident.

However, dismissing the â€œconspiracy and sabotageâ€� theories put forward by Nitish, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav put the blame squarely on the railways. â€œEven a blind man can see that the bridge was dilapidated and hundred years old,â€� he told mediapersons at Patna airport on return from the accident site on Tuesday afternoon. Laloo demanded immediate resignation of the railway minister and punishment to railway officials responsible for the â€œcallous maintenanceâ€� of the bridge.

Chief minister Rabri Devi who, along with Bihar DGP R R Prasad and excise minister Shivanand Tiwari, accompanied Laloo to the site of the disaster, announced an ex gratia payment of Rs 1 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased.

9,Crop insurance scheme fails to enthuse farmers,"HYDERABAD: The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme has failed to inspire small and marginal farmers in the state despite a 50 per cent subsidy in the premium, according to agricultural experts.

The number of farmers covered under the scheme has been declining. While 17.71 lakh farmers were covered during 2000-01 kharif season, in 2001-02 it came down to 15.66 lakh. The situation was no better during rabi crop. The declining trend is also reflected in the area covered under the scheme. During kharif season in 2000, over 23.71 lakh hectares were covered,while it was 23.32 lakh hectares in 2001. In 2001-02 it was 3.09 lakh hectares against 3.19 lakh hectares covered in 2000-01 during rabi season.

When asked about the alleged failure of the government in implementing the crop insurance scheme, a senior official in the agricultural department blamed the implementing agency, the General Insurance Corporation (GIC) for not branching into rural areas. Asked why the GIC was unable to diffuse the scheme to rural areas, a senior official in the GIC attributed it to the lack of sufficient manpower besides non-existence of commission based agency system in the corporation for the crop insurance scheme.

The farmer representatives say that the scheme had failed to win the confidence of the farmers. â€œThe conditions listed in the scheme make it difficult for farmers to go in for insurance,â€� according to Kolli Nageswara Rao, general secretary, Andhra Pradesh Rytu Sangham. He said the system of assessing the crop damage by comparing the past three years average yield was itself erroneous.

â€œExcept 2000-01, the remaining years were affected by drought. So the average yield would definitely be low. Hence, the levels of indemnity should be based on each individual year and not on average of three years,â€� he said. The state government should totally subsidise the premium to encourage farmers by sharing the premium part in the ratio 20:80 with the Centre, he added.

11,Air Chief rules out snags in MiG-21 fighters,"NEW DELHI: Ruling out any major snags in the engine of the upgraded MiG-21 BIS fighters, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal S Krishnaswamy on Wednesday said that the first crash of the new MiGs on Monday could have been caused by the failure of auxillary systems like fuel supply.

Stating that the premlinary cause of the accidents would be known within a week, Krishnaswamy told newsmen on the sidelines of a seminar on armed force''s participation in Disaster relief that ""We don''t expect anything to be wrong with the main engine of the upgraded MiGs"".

In his first comments on the crash of the upgraded fighters christened MiG-21-93 which are yet to be formally inducted into squadron service, the Air Chief said all the upgraded variants had the mandatory new or completely overhauled engines.

He said the fighter which crashed near Ambala, where the upgraded MiG-21 first squadron is coming up, had hardly logged 40 to 50 hours of flying.

Krishnaswamy said after the grounding of entire MiG-21 type75 variant in May the technicians and engineers had recorded a bulletin upgrade of the Russian R-25 engines, which also power the upgraded Mig versions.

The Indian Air Force is in the process of upgrading 125 MiG-21 BIS with Russian and Israeli help. The first of the two Migs, upgraded in Russia, have had faultless trials and the MiG-21 which crashed on Monday had been upgraded at HAL Bangalore.

12,Cong asks Kalam to dismiss Modi govt,"NEW DELHI: At a crowded Press conference here on Wednesday, Gujarat Congress chief Shankersinh Vaghela demanded Presidentâ€™s rule in Gujarat.

He alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Delhi would instigate another â€˜â€˜Kargil type of conflictâ€™â€™ to win the Gujarat elections.

Making a pointed attack on Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, the former BJP chief minister alleged that Advani was the weakest home minister of independent India.

Vaghela charged that it was Advani who had got the â€˜â€˜foreigner issueâ€™â€™ raked up against Sonia Gandhi by Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalitha and Modi.

Vaghela alleged that even though Advani was an MP from Gujarat he had not helped in the development of the state.

He said the BJP leader Arun Jaitley has done a â€˜â€˜disserviceâ€™â€™ to the state by making Modi a chief minister.

â€˜â€˜We have apprehensions that they will start a Kargil war to win Gujarat as part of their politics of vote as they are not yet satisfied with corruption in coffins.â€™â€™

Vaghela alleged that Narendra Modiâ€™s caretaker government was misusing the Government machinery.

He said if the BJP has any morality left it should immediately impose Presidentâ€™s rule in the state.

Later, a Congress delegation with Vaghela and Congress general secretary Kamal Nath met the President A P J Abdul Kalam.

They sought imposition of the Presidentâ€™s rule in the state. Vaghela repeatedly accused the BJP leadership, including Advani, for promoting politics of hatred. He said the Congress has no objection to gaurav yatra if it is held in a peaceful manner. But he warned, if the yatra resulted in riots again, then it would be â€˜â€˜over our dead bodies.â€™â€™

14,BPO policy turns focus on IT training,"BANGALORE: After intense hairsplitting, the Karnataka government has finally released its Millennium BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) policy.

The novelty in an otherwise predictable document is the new focus on training, to be imparted in colleges, schools and to professionals through separate strategies.

The policy aims at establishing 500 new IT Labs in various colleges of the state apart from upgrading the existing ones. ``Each lab will cost around Rs 5 lakh. This infrastructure will be used to improve the listening, comprehension, verbal and written communication skills of students,'''' says IT Secretary Vivek Kulkarni, who released the policy during his recent trip to New York.

The Board for IT Education Standards (Bites), primarily established to enhance IT education standards, will play a prominent role in selecting vendors and formulating syllabi. The Board will also conceptualise and implement training programmes for professionals in major cities of the state.

There are plans to establish a ``high-powered cell'''' in the IT department to promote investment in BPO companies in the state. This cell is expected to advise prospective investors on locations, availability of manpower etc.

``In an attempt to decongest the city, industries which establish their operations outside the limits of the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA), will be encouraged by providing a one-time investment subsidy linked with their employment generation,'''' says IT Minister D.B. Inamdar. Moreover, small scale industries established outside the city limits or those taking up expansion, modernisation and diversification with additional employment generation for BPO activities will be eligible for 100 per cent exemption from payment of stamp duty and registration charges.

Of the 49 BPO companies in the state, 23 were established in 2001-2002. STPI Director B.V. Naidu says: ``Compared to Chennai and Gurgaon, there has been a one year delay in capitalising on the BPO wave. Eight per cent of the Rs 10,000 crore software exports from the state comes from the BPO sector. This could increase to about 20 per cent by next year. The policy is bound to help.''''

Barriers, including employment of women at night, flexible working hours and mandatory weekly offs have been removed by necessary amendments to the relevant Acts. The Labour department will shortly issue notifications to exempt BPO companies from furnishing returns and maintaining certain registers.

On the vexed issues of telecom and power, the document merely recounts what is already known. No quick-fix solutions.

16,Many schools to remain closed due to bandh,"BANGALORE: The state government has not declared a holiday for schools and colleges but several educational institutions have decided to remain closed on Thursday in view of the ``Bangalore bandh'''' call by many pro-Kannada organisations.

17,Badal launches protest against Cong govt,"MUKTSAR: Akali Dal leader and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal launched state-wide demonstrations against the Congress government on Wednesday to counter the persistent netting of his aides by Vigilance Bureau.

The tone and tenor of Badalâ€™s address at an impressive public meeting close to the deputy commissionerâ€™s office here clearly indicated that he would not take Amarinderâ€™s â€˜â€˜offensiveâ€™â€™ against SAD leaders lying down. Badal exhorted people to get ready for a struggle against Amarinderâ€™s style of governance.

Terming Amarinderâ€™s anti-corruption campaign â€˜â€˜hogwash,â€™â€™ Badal, in a veiled threat, warned the chief minister that he might have to pay for his â€˜â€˜persecution campaignâ€™â€™ if SAD returned to power. False and cooked-up cases are being framed against SAD leaders in a mean fashion in order to humiliate them and tarnish their image. Amarinder cannot get away with all this, he said.

Badalâ€™s son Sukhbir Badal said the state government officials engaged in the exercise would have to face the music once SAD returned to power.

He dared Amarinder to register a case of corruption against him adding that if he was found guilty of any corrupt act he could be shot in the open at a roundabout. â€˜â€˜By registering cases of corruption against persons close to me, Amarinder thinks he can catch me in the same net. He is being presumptuous.â€™â€™ Badal challenged him to do so and face the consequences in the state.

Badal said even as Amarinderâ€™s government had failed on all fronts, its one-point agenda seemed to be to drag his family in the VB net. He reiterated his suggestion to appoint a judicial commission to assess the assets of Congress and SAD-BJP ministers, amassed during the last 10 years. He also had a dig at the alleged nexus of Amarinder Singh, Ravi Inder Singh and Gurcharan Singh Tohra which, he said, had lately started targeting gurdwaras and taking over them surreptitiously.

Badal said even if the chief minister claims an inquiry is on into his properties, he would not seek anticipatory bail. He said he was prepared to go to jail anytime. â€˜â€˜The CM just has to let me know of the place where I need to submit myself for whatever interrogation,â€� he said.
