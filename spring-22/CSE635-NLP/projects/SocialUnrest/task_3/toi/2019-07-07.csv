0,Relief camp merger worries riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: The riot-hit are gearing up for a second displacement. This time it was not the fear for life but the government''s insistence to huddle them together at one spot.

Around 12,000 victims from Ahmedabad- who till now have made relief camps their second homes - are anxious about their imminent dislocation. They may have to shift to other camps if the government has its way.

The district administration has drawn up plans to wind up ten camps and merge them all into four camps ''for better co-ordination and upkeep of riot-affected people''. ""Our main concern is to provide proper food, shelter and better management of camps,"" reasons A J Shah, resident deputy collector, Ahmedabad.

The state government was concerned about the plight of these camp inmates; so the plan to integrate various camps for extending better facilities, especially during rains.

The authorities have identified Dudheshwar Municipal School no 1 & 2, Sanklitnagar camp at Juhapura, Haj House at Kalupur and Daryakhan Ghummat camp for merger. ""Some inmates in these camps are staying back out of sheer fear of a flare-up during Rathyatra,"" says Shah adding that the government would run camps for three months.

But dissent is already in the air. Camp organisers and NGOs involved in relief and rehabilitation have opposed such a displacement.

""Government is shying away from rehabilitating riot victims. One can imagine the plight when you huddle 12,000 people in just four camps,"" says Juned Sheikh, co-ordinator, refugee rehabilitation co-ordination committee.

He alleged that the government hastily reduced the number of camps from 79 to 21 and then to 10 to show that rehabilitation was complete. ""Now they want only four camps but this is impossible,"" he adds saying that around 10,000 people are still living in camps though they were formally closed by the government.

""Already 4500 people are staying at Daryakhan Ghummat camp and the government wants to induct 2800 people there,"" says Khalid Sheikh, another camp organiser in walled city areas. He feared that it could aggravate problems for people who have travel from faraway camps to their homes for compensation and other formalities to claim benefits from the government.

However, some camp organisers have hailed the decision to wind up camps and alleged siphoning of relief funds by some counterparts.

""Condition of the some camps was pathetic while camp organisers are interested in the government aid for personal gains,"" says Ataullah Khan, organiser, Daryakhan Ghummat camp.

Another explanation for hurrying up the winding up process was to avoid allotment of alternative site to the victims. ""This will set a very wrong precedent for years to come. Government simply does not want to create another Juhapura,"" says a senior official.

1,Oppn leader blasts RJD govt for waterlogging in city,"PATNA: Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly Sushil Kumar Modi has lambasted the state government for miserably failing to tackle the problem of waterlogging in the state capital.

He said that under the 11th Finance Commission, the Union government has sanctioned an amount of Rs 12.83 crore to the state government for implementing a Rs 25 crore plan for solving the problem of waterlogging in Kankerbagh locality.

The state government had to give matching grant to Biswas Board for the purpose which has not yet been done. As a result this project has not even started. Modi has demanded immediate payment of matching grant to the board for the purpose.

He also said that the state governmentâ€™s claim of clearing drains has been exposed thoroughly as the areas of Kankerbagh, Ashok Nagar, Lohia Nagar, P C Colony, Hanuman Nagar, Sanjay Nagar, Chitragupta Nagar, Bahadurpur Housing Colony, Kumhrar, Kadamkuan and Rajendra Nagar are inundated due to rain for the last few days.

Modi also said that the sump house at Rampur Road is not functioning as power supply of the pump is disconnected since the last six months due to non-payment of dues.

2,"Women protest power cuts, obstruct rail traffic","LUCKNOW: Women residing in 40 Quarter railway colony situated opposite Alambagh police station crossing sat on the tracks near the diesel shed obstructing traffic of the engines moving in for repairs and maintenance on Saturday evening to protest against the pathetic electricity and water supply in the area. The protest continued till the time of filing this report as the protesting housewives blocked the main railway tracks at Alamnagar demanding senior railway officials to visit the site and redress their problems.

It was around 4 pm when hundreds of women residents of the railway colony took to the tracks near the diesel shed and blocked two rail engines. As these engines replace those of the trains arriving and leaving Charbagh, rail traffic was also affected. The protesting women demanded the divisional railway manager or the assistant DRM to come to the site and announce a definite time-frame within which the problems of the residents would be taken care of.

However, neither of the two officers reached the site despite frantic calls by the local police. Later, a senior officer of the engineering wing reached the site but the protesters refused to budge on the ground that during their earlier protest on June 3, officials had assured them that their grievances would be looked into but nothing was done.

Around 8 pm, infuriated over the fact that no senior officer of the railway department bothered to reach the site, the protesting women reached the main railway tracks at Lucknow-Alamnagar line and staged a sit-in. Later, local police and railway employees reached the site and managed to get the tracks cleared. However, the protesting women were still in conversation near the site when the reports last came in.

About a month ago, a similar agitation was launched by the residents of Shantipuram colony housing families of railway employees over poor supply of electricity and water. The agitation was resolved on the intervention of senior officials.

3,SAD leaders may seek tainted partymen's ouster,"LUDHIANA: In order to salvage the image of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which suffered a severe beating as reflected in the local bodies polls and the Delhi Gurdwara Management Committee (DGMC) elections recently, a move is reportedly gaining ground in Akali circles to impress upon SAD supremo Parkash Singh Badal the need for showing the door to tainted former Akali ministers.

According to reliable sources in the party, the issue is likely to be taken up during an important meeting of all the district Akali unit presidents and heads of other state-level party wings, to be convened by Badal at Kalgidhar Niwas, Chandigarh, on Sunday. Though district leaders remained tightlipped about the agenda of this meeting, which is the first one to be held after the partyâ€™s debacle in the DGMC elections, reportedly to deliberate on Panthic affairs in the current political scenario, sources said that there was near unanimity among these leaders to take a categorical stand on the fate of the tainted ministers who had become a â€˜â€˜liabilityâ€� to the party.

Sources pointed out that even though the meeting of the allpowerful Political Affairs Committee, which has some tainted leaders as members, would also be held on the same day, just before Badalâ€™s meeting with district unit presidents, it would not deter the district leaders from raising the issue in the larger interest of the party. All India Youth Wing SAD (Badal) president Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, who is also attending Badalâ€™s meeting, asserted that bold decisions were required at this juncture.

When asked if he supported the issue of dumping the senior leaders allegedly involved in corruption cases, Dhillon said he would leave the decision to the party president, â€˜â€˜if taking such a decision strengthened his handsâ€�. Similar views were aired by a senior district Akali leader who, requesting anonymity, said the decision would certainly enable Badal to keep his flock together amidst reports of â€˜â€˜political poachingâ€� by rival Akali outfits, particularly after the DGMC elections.

4,‘Star presence has become ornamental in politics’,"MUMBAI: The marriage of politics and film has reached its crescendo with the elevation of Vinod Khanna and Shatrughan Sinha as ministers.

The nexus between Bollywood and politics is not as new as it seems. Decades ago, Prithviraj Kapoor and Vyjaintimala were nominated to parliament.

But the dignity of Lok Sabha berths or Rajya Sabha nominations started to be eroded from 1984 when even actors without an exalted social standing began â€˜arrivingâ€™, film industry observers say.

This was because the young Rajiv Gandhi wanted a highly visible, smart team to flash to the millions. â€œPresent developments are both disheartening and ridiculous,â€™â€™ says film historian Feroz Rangoonwala.

â€œStar presence has increasingly become ornamental in politics, especially with the BJP. â€˜â€™ Star lyricist and scriptwriter Javed Akhtar, who has had a long relationship with the countryâ€™s Left, says the trend is more pronounced in regional cinema.

Akhtar argues that politicians have as much right to enter politics as anybody else. His wife, Shabana Azmi, he says, is a social activist who â€œhad to meet politicians and the powers that be to make changesâ€™â€™. He notes, â€œThe problem is not that actors are becoming politicians, but that politicians are becoming actors.â€™â€™

5,Chautala govt sanctions Rs 45 cr for replacing 882 buses,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana transport department has made a provision of Rs 45.85 crore for replacing 882 buses during the current financial year.

Apart from this, the department has also set up training centres for giving post-training certificates drivers of heavy vehicles the driver training institute at Murthal, two workshops the state transport department at Rohtak and Gurgaon and the central workshops Hisar and Karnal.

The profit made by the roadways before paid tax during the year 1999-2000 had been Rs 26.14 crore, which increased to Rs 62.82 crore during the year 2000-01 and the year 2001-02 the profit increased to Rs 105.58 crore, which is the highest in the country.

As compared to the profits, the losses of the roadways after paid taxes stood at Rs 100 crore during 1999-2000, which decreased to Rs 75.19 crore during the year 2000-01 and Rs 46.69 crore during 2001-02.

6,Shiv Sena finally sends out invitations for the party,"MUMBAI: Cartoonist Bal Keshav Thackeray may have loved to hate her. However, the Shiv Sena chief seems to have finally realised that he can do little to wean away his countless followers from the charms of Dame Democracy.

Last Monday, the party embarked on a statewide membership drive in adherence of the diktat of the Election Commission.

This monthlong exercise, which will offer valuable inputs into the Senaâ€™s demographic profile and its socio-economic character, will see senior party functionaries fanning out to the remotest corners of Maharashtra in a bid to swell the Senaâ€™s rank and file to ten lakhs.

The membership marathon will also clear the decks for a major restructuring of the organisation at the grass-roots level, with the accent on younger members, in preparation for the assembly elections, it is learnt. â€œWe will have to target those in their mid-twenties and early thirties. They are the Senaâ€™s torch-bearers of tomorrow,â€™â€™ said a key Sena leader.

For Shiv Sainiks across the state, Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray are the forces to reckon with, never mind the periodic tiffs between the two cousins. â€œWith Uddhavsaab and Raajsaab doing all the legwork and planning, it is clear that the Senaâ€™s accent is on youth,â€™â€™ said a former Sena minister. Thackeray senior keeps himself away from the day-to-day affairs of the Sena.

In another development, Uddhav Thackerayâ€™s wife Rashmi and Raj Thackerayâ€™s wife Sharmila have also enrolled themselves as party members. Smita Jaydeo Thackeray may follow suit, according to party sources.

The Senaâ€™s slow-motion love-affair with democracy is riddled with delicious ironies. Floated in 1968 as a monolithic, cadre-based organisation neatly divided into â€˜shakhasâ€™ (a phrase borrowed from the RSS), the Senaâ€™s raison dâ€™etre, as Mr Bal Thackeray often claimed, was social work. Politics, he explained, was a necessary evil.

However, the first generation of party activistsâ€” Manohar Joshi, Wamanrao Mahadik, Sudhir Joshi, Satish Pradhan and Pramod Navalkarâ€”were soon romancing the ballot box with unbridled enthusiasm.

They were followed by Chhagan Bhujbal (he was then a member of the Sena and was Mr Thackerayâ€™s blue-eyed boy), Narayan Rane, Dattaji Nalavade, Divakar Raote and Anant Gite, to name a few more.

Today, many of them hold crucial offices, both in Maharashtra as well as at the Centre, thus drawing sustenance from the countryâ€™s democratic experiment. Mr Joshi is the Lok Sabha speaker, while Mr Rane is leader of the opposition in the Maharashtra legislative assembly. Both have occupied the chief ministerâ€™s chair.

Mr Gite, who began as Sena corporator in 1985, was recently inducted into the Union cabinet as minister of state for finance. Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil, a former Congress leader from Ahmednagar and a sugar baron who joined the Sena a few years ago, holds cabinet rank in the Union council of ministers.

Desertions, cross-voting, toppling game, power-playâ€” the Sena has tasted the thunder of the â€œnecessary evilâ€™â€™ over the last three decades.

â€œDuring my trip abroad, I am described as the speaker who represents the worldâ€™s largest democracy. This naturally fills my heart with pride,â€™â€™ Mr Joshi said in a recent interview.

Caught between democracy and the Big Daddy from Bandra, how does a Sena functionary divide loyalties? â€œDonâ€™t make a mistake. Our first and foremost devotion is to Balasaheb Thackeray,â€™â€™ said Mr Joshi. The crusty cartoonist thus has the last laugh.

7,"Film, politics ‘sangam’ enters 2002: A Love Story","MUMBAI: The lean, tall rebel of Shaktiâ€” top three buttons of the rough shirt openâ€” hated his father.

But the 60-year-old Amitabh Bachchanâ€”silver goatee, black achkaanâ€”travels hundreds of miles in the campaign-torn and politically throbbing UP heartland to help 64-yearold Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav. The Big B insists, â€œYeh mere pitah ke samaan hai (He is like my dad).â€™â€™

Itâ€™s a phenomenon thatâ€™s picked up steam since the mid-â€™80s. With their image seriously corroded by scams and corruption, politicians have reached for the stars to attract the disillusioned millions.

As a result, people who prance around the fountains of our fantasies have entered politics in unprecedented numbers. They have let themselves be dragged through dusty election trails to address their audiences through gruff loudspeakers. Theyâ€™ve even found cushioned seats for themselves in parliament.

â€œIt seems like parliament has become Bollywood,â€™â€™ flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia says. â€œThe distinctions between the various fields have disappeared. Soon you wonâ€™t have to study to be a doctorâ€” injection le ke mariye.â€™â€™

But even as todayâ€™s drawing room natter chews on just how actors Vinod Khanna and Shatrughan Sinha came to get locked in the cabinet, the marriage of film and politics was consummated a long time ago. Bollywoodâ€™s flirtation with political power can be traced back to Prithviraj Kapoor, Nargis, Sunil Dutt and Vyjantimala, who were nominated to parliament.

Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor had campaigned for Nehruâ€™s aide Krishna Menon as early as the â€™62 Lok Sabha elections from Mumbai.

Dev Anand, his brother Vijay, and others floated the National Party around the Emergency (which died quietly).

9,PPSC ex-secy arrested in Sidhu case,"CHANDIGARH: Vigilance Bureau sleuths arrested senior PCS officer Prithpal Singh, who had been secretary of the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) during the tenure of Ravinder Pal Singh Sidhu as chairman, for allegedly being party to the irregularities in the PPSC selections.

Prithpal is at present posted as district grievances office in Hoshiarpur.

Chief director of the Bureau A P Pandey said the former PPSC secretary was privy many administrative irregularities committed by the then PPSC chairman.

Besides the touts who were associated with Sidhu, Prithpal is the first senior PPSC official to be taken into custody after more than four monthsâ€™ investigation by the Bureau. Pandey said he had been arrested in a separate FIR registered by the Bureau to examine the more than 3,000 selections made in all during the tenure of Sidhu.

Prithpalâ€™s connivance with Sidhu came the fore soon after the arrest of the former chairman when Prithpal had reportedly whisked away five of Sidhuâ€™s pistols and sent them to persons close to him in Ropar and Patiala. Prithpal was earlier questioned by the Vigilance for burning answer scripts and other records of the PPSC about a month before Sidhu was taken into custody.

Prithpal had told the investigating officials that he had taken this step at the instance of Sidhu.

He would be produced in the court on Sunday for further remand.

10,Godhra court acquits 9 accused in riot cases,"GODHRA: A Godhra court has acquitted nine persons, accused in a case of burning and destruction of shops in Lunawada town in Panchmahal district, for lack of evidence.

The incident had taken place on February 27, a few hours after the Godhra train massacre. Sources said the accused were let off following a compromise struck between the shop-keepers and the accused. Significantly, the local BJP MP Bhupendrasinh Solanki was the defence counsel in the case assisted by a panel of lawyers.

Police said the accused had been arrested immediately after the incident from the spot of the crime even though they maintained that they were not involved in any violence.

All the witnesses in the case, apart from the policemen, turned hostile in the court during the hearings because of the compromise. Delivering the judgment in just four months after the incident, additional district and sessions judge Viral Desai, acquitted them observing that the prosecution had failed to prove charges against them in connection with the February 27 incident.

She observed that the case cannot stand merely on the evidence provided by the police and there was a need for independent eye-witnesses to substantiate the police statement.

12,PWG withdraws from talks with Andhra govt,"HYDERABAD: The Peopleâ€™s War emissaries, revolutionary poet Varavara Rao and balladeer Gaddar, have withdrawn from the talks with the government to find a solution to the naxalite problem protesting against the â€œfake encounters and police oppressionâ€� during the ceasefire period.

They also said that they had â€œlost linkâ€� with the PW cadre. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, they said that their role in the peace mission came to an end soon after the third round of talks on June 20. The continuing fake encounters on the PW cadre when they were maintaining ceasefire shows that the government was not sincere in finding a peaceful solution to the problem.

Demanding judicial inquiry into the Nerella encounter on July 2, and other encounters in Warangal, Karimnagar and Warangal districts, the PW emissaries wanted the government to book cases under Section 302 against the police personnel involved in the encounters. They further demanded that a monitoring committee be constituted to help create a conducive atmosphere for talks.

Referring to commercial taxes minister K Vijayarama Raoâ€™s statement that the naxalite issue was a multi-prolonged one, they criticised the government of waging multi-pronged attacks on the PW. The government was killing naxalites in the name of encounters, they said. The two emissaries apprehended that there was a threat to their lives.

The government was hiring surrendered naxalites to eliminate those who took active part in the peace process. A few of the civil liberties leaders were also facing threat from this hired persons, they alleged.

13,Guj govt will have to decide on Assembly polls: Advani,"AHMEDABAD: Agreeing that the situation was not yet normal in Gujarat, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Sunday said it is for the state government to decide when to hold the Assembly elections as its term is coming to an end.

""The people are still gripped by a sense of insecurity and complete peace and normalcy would said to have been restored in the riot-hit Gujarat when there was a sense of security among all sections of the people,"" Advani told a press conference here.

However, he gave credit to Chief Minister Narendra Modi for controlling the unprecedented violence and said, ""the state government performed well to contain the violence. If it had fully controlled the situation within two or three days, it would have been to its credit but it didn''t happen this way.""

""Some vested interests did not want the situation to become normal and I don''t want to spell them out (vested interests). However, after sometime, the situation was brought under control,"" the deputy prime minister said.

To a question if there was going to be any change in Gujarat both at the government and organisational levels on the pattern of the recent reshuffle effected at the Centre, Advani said, ""even state government has to be innovative. Anyway, their term is coming to an end and they will have to face the electorate. They have to decide on when to hold the elections and what kind of governance they propose to give to the people.""

To a question as to what he thought of the peformance of Modi, Advani said, ""removing sense of insecurity among the people was also a part of good governance"" and denied that he was anyway instrumental in the appointment of Modi as Gujarat chief minister.

""Modi was chosen for the post by both the Central BJP and state unit of the party,"" the senior party leader said.

He said, ""in my 50 years in public life I have seen that more often than not communal riots are sparked off by trivial issues. They are difficult to control. The violence in parts of Gujarat was caused by the horrendous incident of February 27 at Godhra when Sabarmati Express train attacked by a mob.""

On appointment of K P S Gill as security advisor to Chief Minister, he said Modi had discussed with him the plan of bringing the former policeman to Gujarat as he (Gill) was known for his down to earth approach.

""Gill has done well to contain the violence after taking over as Security Advisor to Modi,"" Advani quipped.

Asked if the ""leaking"" of the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report appended to the chargesheet against the 54 accused involved in the Godhra train carnage has cast doubts on the so far held belief that the mob had attacked the Sabarmati Express passengers, Advani said there was no doubt whatsoever about anything and added that ""women, children and other passengers who were charred to death after the S-6 coach was set ablaze would not have killed themselves.""

""Some people from the mob had entered the Sabarmati Express'' coach and spilled the inflammable substance inside the compartment before setting it on fire,"" Advani said, adding that the whole thing was pre-planned.

Earlier, inaugurating a primary health centre set up by the health department of Gujarat government at Rupal village in Gandhinagar district, Advani said the BJP''s aim was to provide good administration as the governments could not change ""swaraj into surajya"" even after fifty years and could not provide drinking water or health services.

""We could not even give a better administration and therefore, the BJP''s aim is to provide good administration,"" he said.

He said still, there was a need to put emphasis on three areas of security, education and health which were of primary importance.

Hailing the people of Gujarat, Advani said the expertise of Gujaratis abroad in information technology had helped the people of the country to be on part with the people of Japan and other developed countries in terms of achievements.

At present India was considered a developing country but it should be etablished as a developed country, he said.

Health Minister Ashok Bhatt said this was the first model health centre in the country with intensive care unit and child care unit which had been linked with the Asia''s biggest Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad by computer network.

The government was intending to reduce the death rate among new born babies and mothers, he said and added that a sum of Rs 200 crore had been allotted for healthcare services and various projects worth Rs 600 crore with the help of the World Bank have been taken up for implementation.

19,Weak laws boost VCD piracy: DCP,"NEW DELHI: Piracy of video compact discs (VCDs) appears to be growing rapidly, with illegal copying units coming up in every nook and corner of the city.

â€˜â€˜Thousands of illegal units are producing pirated VCDs of Bollywood and Hollywood films,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police, economic offences wing, Dinesh Bhatt. The profit margins in this business has drawn investments even from the rural belt, he said.

â€˜â€˜A CD writer costs about Rs 60,000 and is capable of copying 10 VCDs simultaneously in about 10 minutes. So a blank CD which costs Rs 12 sells for anything between Rs 50 and Rs 100 once a film is copied on it,â€™â€™ said Bhatt. So an investment of about Rs 60,000 yields upto Rs 2,000 a day. â€˜â€˜Earlier copying CDs required a big unit costing around Rs 4 crore. But with investment requirements going down, even small-time entrepreneurs are involving themselves in the illegal business,â€™â€™ said Bhatt.

â€˜â€˜The network is so strong that if original prints of a movie are not available, the master copies are smuggled from abroad,â€™â€™ said an inspector.

The police said piracy trade is fuelled by a huge demand. â€˜â€˜There is a huge demand for pirated VCDs as original ones are almost three times more expensive,â€™â€™ said the inspector.

Though almost 50,000 pirated VCDs were seized in raids this year, the police claim their action seems to have done little curtail the trade. â€˜â€˜Nobody is afraid of arrest under the Copyrights Act as it invites a punishment upto only six months or a fine of Rs 50,000. The offence is bailable,â€™â€™ said a police officer.

Mostly kingpins involved in the VCD piracy business remain untouched. â€˜â€˜They engage others for writing VCDs. So even if we raid the premises of such units, we never manage to arrest their owners,â€™â€™ said a police officer.

Public awareness can help discourage VCD piracy, claim the police. â€˜â€˜A pirated VCD is an inferior product. If people realise this and donâ€™t demand pirated VCDs, their demand would go down and the business would die a natural death,â€™â€™ said the officer.

20,Alternative routes for trucks not ready,"NEW DELHI: In just about five weeks, trucks not carrying goods meant for Delhi will not be allowed to enter the city. While August 16 has been set as the deadline for these vehicles by the Delhi police commissioner, infrastructure to divert them is yet to be put in place. ''For implementing the apex court's order effectively, the neighbouring states — Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Haryana — should create adequate infrastructure. But the Delhi police commissioner has been asked to enforce the orders,'' said a senior Delhi traffic police officer. Creating infrastructure means building motorable roads, putting up road signs and taking care of congested villages and markets along bypass routes. The commissioner set the deadline on May 16 so that the neighbouring states had ample time to prepare themselves. ''The three-month period was acceptable to all parties involved,'' a transport department official said. ''If the order is enforced without making adequate arrangements, there will be chaos at the city borders,'' said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Satish Golcha. State transport authority officials say the diversions for these trucks have to be at least 10 to 15 km away from the borders so that traffic there is not affected. In the absence of a proper diversion — preferably a ring outside Delhi's periphery — alternative routes have been identified. ''Traffic police officers visited UP and Haryana to trace suitable roads for diverted trucks. They had to coordinate with the local agencies and chalk out alternative routes,'' DCP (New Delhi range traffic) Arun Kampani said. But the personnel who inspected the routes found they were not fit for movement of trucks. ''These roads are simply not made for heavy trucks,'' Kampani said. In fact, the northeast Delhi traffic police had even identified the 46-km stretch which needed improvement. ''We divided the entire stretch into segments. The physical condition of every segment, its width, number of lanes, central verge, road markings and other features like congested villages, markets and railway crossings were assessed. Not a single segment measured up on these parameters,'' he said. Although such assessments were not conducted elsewhere, an assistant commissioner of police who visited some of these alternative routes said: ''The roads are in poor shape. Signs are missing. And at some places, there are bridges that cannot take the load of trucks.''

21,"One killed, 15 injured in rioting at Chhota Udepur","CHHOTA Udepur: One person was killed and 15 others, including nine security personnel, were injured in rioting that took place here late on Saturday night. Rioters went on an arson spree and burnt down at least 15 shops and kiosks in the town.It took merely two hours and a brawl between two school children to disrupt peace in this town which had remained peaceful since the Godhra carnage barring stray incidents. According to police sources, rioters went on a rampage in the town following confusion over the damage to a vehicle during the brawl.The rioting began when miscreants set a kiosk in the main market of the town on fire. ""Rumours started circulating in the town with members of both communities thinking that the kiosk was burnt by the other. With tempers rising on each side several premises were set on fire,"" said special IGP (Vadodara range) Deepak Swaroop.The police fired 69 rounds and 28 teargas shells to control the violence. One person was killed and at least five others injured in the firing. Police sources said the person killed was a 45-year-old man while the injured included two women.According to police sources, two schoolboys had a tiff earlier in the day. ""The boys belonged to the same community. However, one of them took refuge in a tempo when the other overpowered him. The boy outside the vehicle smashed its windscreen and damaged it. What sparked off trouble was the fact that the vehicle belonged to the person of a different community,"" said district superintendent of police Piyush Patel.Residents of the town point out that unlike previous incidents in the region, tribals were not involved in rioting this time. ""The people were from the town itself. We do not know what sparked off the row, but it left my shop charred,"" said Haji Hasanali Dahodwala, whose hardware shop was burnt in the Main Bazar area of the shop.Miscreants also burnt his son Joharali's shop in the Nagarpalika Shopping Centre. Said Joharali, ""At least 15 to 20 shops in the town have been charred. We came to know of the damage only in the morning when we came to see our shops.""Rioters also bashed up deputy mamlatdar Chhatrasinh Rathwa when he came out in the town searching for the sub-divisional magistrate. ""I thought that my presence was necessary on the field due to the trouble. A mob of about 2,000 people of a particular community tried to obstruct my way and started beating me up with blunt objects. However, I managed to escape,"" he said.The dearth of police force in the town was glaring. For the entire town there were only 70 policemen, including State Reserve Police (SRP) jawans. District collector Bhagyesh Jha said that another platoon of SRP was arriving in the town for bandobast. Jha added that the concept of community policing had been launched at the peace committee meeting on Sunday afternoon to take care of any further trouble. ""We have identified 10 sensitive areas which shall be monitored by select persons belonging to both communities. Their job will be to keep tempers under control and help the police,"" he said.

23,"Gujarat trade, industry bandh today in Ambani's honour","AHMEDABAD: For a person who strived all his life to maximise production, it may sound strange that his peers have decided to pay tribute to him by observing Monday as a bandh as a mark of respect.

But that''s the way the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) on Sunday decided to pay tribute to Reliance patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani. It asked the trade and industry in the state to observe a bandh on Monday as a mark of respect to the industrialist who played a pioneering role in the development of industries in Gujarat.

The functionaries of the GCCI and other trade and business associations held an emergency meeting and condoled the death of the Reliance group chairman.

The meeting, held under the presidentship of Mahendra Shah, was attended by leading industrialists and businessmen, who hailed the services rendered by Dhirubhai.

24,Sanor murder case: No arrests yet,"VADODARA: The district police here are yet to make any breakthrough in the murder case of two members of the minority community that took place at Sanor village in Shinor taluka. No arrests have been made in the case so far.

Police sources said that the victims were murdered in the night when they were asleep. ""There are no eye-witnesses to the case. This leaves us with little option, but to rely on circumstantial evidence and the forensic experts'' report,"" said a top police official.

As reported earlier, Ismail Mohammed Mansuri and his son Noormohammed Mansuri were clubbed to death by unidentified persons in their house on Thursday night and their bodies recovered later.

The police have, however, ruled out of any communal angle to the incident. ""There are other families of the minority community staying in the village. However, they did not face any trouble. It seems that they were murdered due to other reasons,"" said district superintendent of police Piyush Patel.

Patel said that the police have launched a major manhunt to locate the persons who reportedly had enmity with the deceased and their family.

25,State govt drafts peace package for Maoists,"MUMBAI: In response to the continuing violence in the Naxalite-dominated districts of the state, the state government has drafted a policy offering a comprehensive package to Maoist rebels laying down their arms.

Life insurance, housing under the Indira Awaas Yojana, jobs under the Prime Ministerâ€™s Employment Scheme, monetary incentives for self- employment and cash rewards upto Rs 50,000 are some of the highlights the surrender policy offers, senior government officials said.

The policy will be implemented in Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia, Yavatmal and Nanded district which have been described as â€˜â€˜Naxalite-proneâ€™â€™. Intelligence reports state that Gadchiroli has been completely taken over by the Naxalites. The government now seeks satellite surveillance to track down their movements.

The government hopes to counter the violence by inviting Naxalites to join the mainstream. As such, the government will give Rs 50,000 to a Naxalite who surrenders with a rocket launcher, Rs 30,000 for those with AK-series rifles, Rs 15,000 for someone giving up with a 9 mm carbine or a 7.62 mm self-loading rifle and Rs 6,000 for those laying down .303 rifles, pistols and revolvers.

Amounts ranging between Rs 1,000 and Rs 6,000 will be paid to those surrendering with remote controlled devices, rockets, explosives, grenades and wireless sets.

Though the government will award various incentives to a Naxalite, it will not withdraw criminal cases against him or her. A Naxalite may surrender before the district superintendent of police, his deputy or even the police station in- charge but intelligence agencies will confirm that the Naxalite is doing so of his own will and is not a â€˜plantâ€™ or a mole in the official circles.

If the activities of a Naxalite who has surrendered are found suspicious later on, the government will withdraw all facilities extended to him or her.

26,8 BJP leaders charged with anti-party activities,"KANPUR: Taking a serious note of complaints of party leaders regarding anti-party activities, the disciplinary committee of the Bharatiya Janata Party has decided to issue notices to eight local leaders including a former MLA in the city.

These leaders have been charged with working against the interests of the party during the last assembly elections.

Insiders said that BJP leaders Balchandra Mishra and K C Sonkar, who were candidates from the Govind Nagar and Sisamau constituencies had held the disgruntled group of the party responsible for their defeat in the last assembly elections and urged the party organisation to take action against erring party leaders.

The state organisation later personally talked to complainants and asked them to present the proof against insurgents. This issue was seriously discussed at the review meeting after the elections and those who had lost the elections had raked up the issue strongly at the meeting.

Acting upon the complaints regarding anti-party activities by the disgruntled group, the state organisation had now decided to issue notices to eight leaders including one former MLA and a senior office bearers of the Kanpur South unit.

Sources said that the state leaders found that these leaders were unhappy over the denial of party tickets to them and they joined hands with candidates of the opposite parties due to their political rivalry with leaders of their own party. The state organisation was very upset over the poor performance of the party in Kanpur during the last assembly elections as senior leaders felt that the party lost two important seats â€” Govind Nagar and Sisamau â€” due to inner-party groupism.

Sources said that state leaders were serious about taking action against the insurgents in view of the forthcoming Parliamentary elections as the party organisation felt that it was high time that erring party workers got a clear message from the high command. Leaders opined that action was a must against the disgruntled group otherwise they might repeat similar acts in the future also.

27,All-party meet on electoral reforms today,"NEW DELHI: The crucial all-party meeting on the Supreme Courtâ€™s May 2 directive to the Election Commission to seek on affidavit antecedents of the poll candidates will be held on Monday.

The government is planning to raise â€˜â€˜crucial doubtsâ€™â€™ on the order and evolve a consensus on introducing safeguards. Informal talks with the NDA allies and the Congress began earlier to apprise them of the stand the government will take in the all-party meeting.

On Friday, newly-appointed minister of state for law Ravi Shankar Prasad met Manmohan Singh and Shivraj Patil of the Congress in this regard.

â€˜â€˜So far, there is a positive response,â€™â€™ said Prasad. Though he maintained that â€˜â€˜if there is a popular urge to rectify something, the political establishment should react through legislative interventionâ€™â€™.

Prasad raised issues which looked certain to dominate the all-party meeting. â€˜â€˜These are my prima facie views in the light of the understanding of the SC directive. The formal government response would have to wait till the July 8 meeting,â€™â€™ he explained.

â€˜â€˜Police cases emerging out of political activity should be seggregated from corruption, rape, kidnapping and other cases,â€™â€™ he said.

â€˜â€˜Another areaâ€™â€™, said Prasad, â€˜â€˜to be debated is the consequences arising out of filing incorrect information.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜There is the chance of a deviant returning officer rejecting the nomination papers on technical grounds. An otherwise laudable objective may become a tool to oust a serious candidate right at the threshold,â€™â€™ Prasad said.

Another legal issue the meeting will have to grapple with is how to implement the new set of qualifications. â€˜â€˜The Peopleâ€™s Representation Act provides for qualifactions and disqualifications. We have to evolve a consensus on whether additional sets can be added by executive order or amendment,â€™â€™ Prasad said.

28,"BJP, SP activists clash over pradhan’s death in Bithoor","KANPUR: At least two dozen persons suffered injuries in a clash between BJP and Samajwadi Party supporters in Gambheerpur Kachara village in Bithoor police circle on Sunday at noon.

However, timely intervention by the district police averted the scene from going of hand. The police had to resort to lathi charge to control the mob. Trouble started in Gambheerpur village following the murder of a BJP leader Ramkripal allegedly by supporters of the Samajwadi Party. Ramkripalâ€™s wife Rambeti had won the gram pradhan elections in the village with the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party. After Ramkripalâ€™s murder, the village was politically divided between the two groups â€” one led by Yadavas and other by the Nonia community.

Fresh tension was sparked off in Gambheerpur and adjoining areas when rumours gripped in the area that yadavs were being beaten up by a group of the Nonia community. A huge crowd of Yadavs from Ramel village reached Gambheerpur to take revenge on the rival community. Both the groups hurled stones and bricks at each other leaving about two dozen injured.

Rival groups also bashed each other with canes and this bloody scene continued for about half an hour. Meanwhile, a police force reached the spot and resorted to lathi charge to control the frenzied mob.

Reportedly, trouble started when the family members of the deceased who were returning after cremation of Ram Kripal beat up one Prem Singh severely. Reports added that Prem Singh of Ramel village was the relative of Malkhan Singh who was named in the FIR. The family members were so agitated that they snatched the tractor of Prem Singh and scolded him.

29,Politicians in Bihar protest EC move,"PATNA: Biharâ€™s political circles are aflutter after the Election Commission issued a notice (EC) regarding the implementation of the Supreme Court orders on the electorateâ€™s right to know about the criminal antecedents and financial assets of a candidate.

Many agree the changes brought in the nomination papers for parliamentary and state legislature polls are â€œexplosiveâ€�. â€œThrough media reports the electorate knows the background of a candidate even before he files his nomination papers,â€� said JD(U) leader Ganesh Prasad Yadav. He, however, conceded the notification can have an effect on corruption if â€œit is followed upâ€�. â€œCharges of corruption can be framed against politicians on the basis of the affidavits given by them while filing their nomination papers.â€�

BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi stressed the notification does not address the real problems. â€œDeclaration of movable and immovable assets should have also been made applicable,â€� he said.

â€œIf declaration of assets is applicable in the case of politicians, why not for the judiciary?â€� asked RJD spokesman Shivanand Tiwari. Modi and Tiwari may have sharp political differences, but both of them agree that giving powers to officials to reject nomination papers on the ground of furnishing â€œwrong or incomplete informationâ€� or â€œsuppression of any material informationâ€� is dangerous.
