0,Prudential depositor commits suicide,"HYDERABAD: A depositor of the Prudential Co-operative Urban Bank committed suicide after the bank refused to return his deposit.

M A Basith, a retired employee of the Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), was in need of money to perform his daughter''s marriage and wanted to withdraw Rs 2 lakh he had deposited at the bank''s Shahalibanda branch.

According to police, Basith set himself ablaze at his house in Chatrinaka on January 25. He was rushed to the Owaisi Hospital where he succumbed to his burns on Saturday morning. Basith had four daughters and two sons. He had married off three daughters and was planning to conduct his last daughter''s marriage in February.

The bank officials failed to return the money though it had already matured by March 2003. He went to the bank on several occasions requesting the officials to return the money, but in vain. Basith was a diabetes patient and in a dilemma for the last few days as he could not get the money for his daughter''s marriage. That could be the reason behind the step, his brother Waheb said.

According to another relative, Basith was in a state of depression ever since the Prudential Bank scam came to light.

""His hard-earned money was mismanaged by the bank leading to his death,"" Aleem Baig said.

However, a bank official said that they were unable to allow the depositors to draw more than Rs 1,000 due to a Reserve Bank of India stricture. The RBI had imposed section 35A to this effect, after the financial scandal came to light, the official said.

The steering committee of the bank officials had recovered Rs 108 crore in nine months, he added. In a similar case on January 22, Mohammed Siddique, a depositor of the Charminar Co-operative Urban bank died as he could not afford a heart surgery after the bank failed to return his money.

1,BKS sends letter to government for talks,"GANDHINAGAR: While the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) sent a letter on Saturday to the Narendra Modi government, finally agreeing to hold talks with the five-person ministerial group on ""contentious farmers'' issues"" on February 3, the state officialdom seemed unwilling to bring down the hike in power tariff â€” the main BKS demand.

The state was busy with preparing a package deal for farmers,providing surface irrigation waters as the main offer. Setting aside its past belligerent mood, the BKS letter, sent to state energy minister Saurabh Patel, listed seven ""talking points"". They included meeting the government half-way on tariff rate instead of the past demand for total withdrawal, withdrawal of the four per cent sales tax on tractors imposed a year ago, providing power connections to the pending applicants â€” numbering 2.84 lakh â€” within a year and disbursing Rs 600 crore against crop insurance.

Talking to TNN, a senior minister of the Modi-appointed team for talks with the BKS said, ""The farmers should realise that any move to allow them to use more power at a time when the ground water levels were depleting, has no meaning."" Underlining the same, state water resources minister Narottam Patel said, ""Pumping water is becoming increasingly costly. We have worked out detailed plans for North Gujarat as an alternative.""

Revealing details, he said, ""If the Rs 2,504-crore project to take storm waters from the Narmada canal via 15 pipes to fill up Dharoi, Sipu, Dantiwada, Mukteshwar, Guhai, Hathmati, Meshwo, Mazham and Vatrak dams is under implementation, we are planning a new project worth Rs 465 crore connecting all 21 North Gujarat rivers via a recharge canal taking excess storm waters from the Kadana dam.""

""Currently, North Gujarat farmers use nearly 2,000 MW of power to extract scarce underground water for irrigation. This power would be saved once the two projects, costing nearly Rs 3,000 crore, are completed,"" Narottam said. Agreeing that the 15 pipelines to be laid to take Narmada water upstream to the nine dams too would require power, he claimed, ""The electricity to be consumed would be just 250 MW.""

Though Narottam said that the two projects together would bring under surface irrigation 2.17 lakh hectares within the next five years, the BKS, suspect state officials, may want an ""interim"" arrangement in an effort to pressurise the government to bring down the tariff-hike. Though plans include forming 273 checkdams too, doubts exist on when the two projects would be finished.

Continuing for the last two years, so far the government has not even been able to lay down a single pipeline of the 15 to fill up nine North Gujarat dams, which are never filled up beyond 50 per cent of their capacity. ""The first pipeline, at a cost of Rs 311 crore, taking waters to Dharoi will take another three months to complete,"" the minister said. This, despite the fact that 70 per cent of the project is funded by National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (Nabard).

As for the Rs 465-crore recharge canal, an official said, ""The water resources department has demanded Rs 70 crore, but we are not sure how much would be allocated for 2004-05."" Then, the amount of water to be made available from Kadana is just 2,000 cubic metres per second (cusecs) for 80 to 130 days in a year. ""Even this water will be available provided there is a more economical use of water in Kadana''s command area,"" he added.

4,'Laloo kin' men clash with residents,"PATNA: At least three persons received gunshot injuries when a group of people allegedly associated with Nagendra Rai, a nephew of RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav, clashed with the residents and businessmen of the Raja Bazaar, Samanpura and Ashiana Nagar area agitating near the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here on Bailey Road late on Saturday evening.

The residents and businessmen continued to block the road near the IGIMS till late night. When contacted, city SP Ganesh Kumar confirmed that three persons identified as Ashraf Khan, Chhotu and Jishan were injured in the firing.

A section of the businessmen, however, alleged that four persons received injuries when Nagendra''s supporters opened fire.

According to a section of the agitators, the trouble began in the area when one Javed went to a shop and demanded ""rangdari"" (extortion) money from the shopkeeper.

It finally led to a clash between Javed and the shopkeeper. Other businessmen came in support of the shopkeeper and beat up Javed.

However, the police maintained that Javed had gone to the shop to return some clothes he had purchased there. Javed lodged a complaint with the Shastrinagar police station in this regard.

The matter took a serious turn when a large number of businessmen reached the police station to lodge a counter FIR against Javed and his associates, who are alleged to be supporters of Nagendra. The businessmen alleged that the police refused to register their complaint.

""In the meantime, Nagendra along with his supporters reached the police station. His supporters clashed with the businessmen on the police station premises. We were forced by the police to leave the police station,"" said an agitator while explaining the circumstances leading to the road blockade by them near the IGIMS.

The businessmen accused the police of extending ""support"" to the Nagendra group during the clash with them on the police station premises.

""Hamlogon ko khadera gaya, use kursi di gayi,"" said another agitator near the blockade site, adding that the police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the businessmen on the police station premises.

The police opted to be a mute spectator at the time of road blockade by the businessmen. The riot control vehicle ""Vajra"" and fire brigade units were also pressed into service late in the evening.

Earlier, irate businessmen announced their decision to continue with their agitation on Sunday. They will gather on the same spot on Sunday morning, according to an announcement made on the spot by the businessmen.

The police have intensified patrolling in the area. A large contingent of police force remained deployed there till late Saturday night.

On the basis of the information, the chartered accountant, Satya Prakash, was arrested on Sunday. During his interrogation, he confirmed his role in the I-T official''s operations.
