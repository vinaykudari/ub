0,Me-first is the rule of the highway,"PANCHKULA: Picture a Nisan Patrol attempting to overtake a Tata Sumo, which is overtaking a tractor-trolley, on a single carr i a g e highway.

Punjab Roadways bus swerves dangerously while going past a heavily laden truck, forcing a two-wheeler rider off the road. Most commercial vehicle drivers could care less about the safety of others and their own as they pound brakes and accelerate mindlessly.

The Panchkula-Surajpur section of national highway 22, is a nightmare for both drivers and pedestrians, for whom safety comes first.With just about everyone being in a desperate hurry to leave the others behind, road safety on this stretch does not mean a thing.

Some policemen stationed at Chandimandir police station go to the extent saying that they themselves tread the road when itâ€™s absolutely unavoidable. Accidents on this high traffic corridor have cut short many a life, but rash motorists have not learnt a lesson. Unmindful of the consequences of not attaching importance to road safety, rash and negligent motorists continue to pose serious traffic hazards on the road.

A policeman posted at the Chandimandir police station says most accidents take place when two or more vehicles try to overtake another vehicle simultaneously. Taking into consideration that the road is highly accident prone, the police has fixed roadside billboards at regular intervals bearing emergency telephone numbers for the benefit of accident victims.

The policeman points out, â€˜â€˜Motorists are aware of the fact that the road is accident prone. Nevertheless, they do not refrain from dangerous overtaking and overspeeding.â€™â€™

What makes matters worse is that some twowheeler riders do not put on helmets, as there are no traffic policemen in attendance along the stretch to enforce rules.

2,One arrested in ICICI Bank robbery,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police claims to have cracked the year-old ICICI Bank robbery case and have arrested the main accused.

On July 23, 2001, about Rs 2 crore of the Connaught Place branch of ICICI Bank was robbed by four persons.

Three others accused in the bank robbery are still absconding.

The police said transport company Brinks Arya used to transport the cash in vans to various ATMs.

During one such transaction, the guard Jaswant, a cashier and the driver Dharamvir were present in the van.

Once the van left the CP branch, the driver and guard allegedly overpowered the cashier. They drove the van to Sonepat where they met their accomplices Jitender and Jagbir.

The four drove further to Brijwasan and transferred the cash into big boxes which were buried in a farmhouse. Subsequently, the robbers parted ways.

Later, they hired a tractor trolley and transported the cash boxes to Najafgarh. The accused reportedly told the police the robbed money had been spent on buying properties.

The police said Jitender alias Champu was also wanted in an attempt to murder case in Sonepat.

He was a proclaimed offender in the case but surrendered last week.

A Delhi Police team on October 5 arrested Jitender from Sonepat and brought him to Delhi on transit remand. They had sought a police remand up to October 19.

The police have also arrested four associates of Jitender but they were not involved in the ICICI robbery. They include Dalbir Singh, Angrez Singh, Chand Singh and Sri Kishan.

3,RSS dassera rally to be held earlier,"NAGPUR: The Rashtriya Swaya m s e -wak Sangh (RSS) may be known for its u n b e n d i n g stance on ideological matters.

However, the Hindu monolith has in recent past shown pragmatism. This year, the RSS will break one more tradition by advancing its Vijaya Dashami rally and the Sarsanghachalakâ€™s address by two days. An unprecedented security arrangement, with the deployment of the state reserve police force (SRPF), to ward of any terrorist attack, will mark the occasion. For the last 77 years, the RSS chief â€™s address on the morning of Vijaya Dashami day is being keenly studied by politicians.

After Swayamsewaks in full uniform wielding their trademark stick perform the drill and demonstrate the awe-inspiring martial arts, the Sarsanghachalak addresses them. The speech on the occasion normally reflects the RSSâ€™s views on current affairs of the nation and also outlines the organisationâ€™s line of action for the year ahead.

This year, the RSS rally will be held on Sunday (October 13), two days before the Vijaya Dashami day. And the fifth RSS chief, K.S. Sudarshan, will address the rally in the evening instead of the early morning schedule. Surprisingly, the tradition is being broken for the only reason that a Sunday would draw more Swayamsewaks and people to participate in the rally.

According to city unit chief Dilip Gupta, many activists had been finding it difficult to make it to the rally because they were busy with Dasera celebrations. But by advancing the event, the RSS is targeting a 10,000-strong participation, The change is ostensibly to avoid a clash between the family celebrations and the commitment of the RSS activists to the organisation. But for some years, the falling attendance at the Vijaya Dashami rally as also the daily â€˜shakhasâ€™ has been a matter of concern and debate among the top echelons of the Sanghâ€™s rigid hierarchy.

The Sangh leaders have even attributed the poor attendance to the changing urban lifestyle and the negative influence of the television. Sudarshan may have a large Sunday audience and draw more media attention this Vijaya Dashami in the backdrop of his differences with the BJP-led government and Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee over economic issues.

According to Sangh sources, despite efforts, no truce has been arrived at between the BJP and its mentor, the RSS, at recent meetings in New Delhi. The RSS chief is expected to express his strong opposition to the NDA governmentâ€™s disinvestment policy as well as the soft approach in dealing with cross-border terrorism.

4,BJP plans ‘hisab do’ rally,"PATNA: The BJP has decided to organise â€˜Janata ko hisab doâ€™ rally at all the district headquarters between October 20 and October 30 to highlight the failure of the RJD government to spend central funds worth Rs 12,481 crore during the past 10 years.

The rally will also highlight the partyâ€™s second phase of â€˜Gaon Chaloâ€™ programme starting from October 20. Talking to mediapersons, the state BJP chief Nand Kishore Yadav on Thursday said that the BJP leaders including several Union ministers visited 26,273 villages of the state during the first phase of its â€˜Gaon Chaloâ€™ programme which began on September 25 and concluded on October 6. Describing the first phase of the programme as a major success, Nand Kishore Yadav said that the party has succeeded in reaching millions of people below the poverty line during the 12-day programme.

He said that since the party had launched the programme when there is still two years left for the next Lok Sabha elections, people turn up in large number at all the village level meetings to listen to the BJP leaders besides narrating their woes to them.

He said that the people are now convinced that BJP leaders are not indulging in any election gimmick. The BJP chief said that the party activists had collected the status of various development projects from the villagers and would submit the same to district magistrates of the concerned districts during the second phase of its â€˜Gaon Chaloâ€™ programme.

He said that 3,522 teams of the party had visited 26,273 villages falling under 6,482 panchayats during the programme. Remaining 1,500 panchayats would be covered during the second phase, said Yadav.

Nand Kishore Yadav while alleging serious irregularities in the implementation of Indira Awas Yojna (IAY) said that the beneficiaries have to grease the palms of the concerned officials to get a house under the scheme. He said that IAY houses had also been allotted to even well off people. The state government is also yet to identify the beneficiaries under Antyodaya and Annapurna programmes.

Referring to RJD governmentâ€™s failure to spend the central grants during the last ten years, The BJP chief also said that of Rs 11,546 crore released by the Centre during 1992-97 the state government could spend only Rs 5,507 crore. Similarly, he said, the state government spend only Rs 10,237 crore of the Rs 16,680 crore released by the Centre during 1997-2002.

He also criticised Rabri government for its failure to give financial powers to the local bodies.

5,Ranvir Sena makes a mockery of law; holds meeting,"ARA: The irony could not have been more pronounced, the outlawed Ranvir Sena held a function to celebrate its eighth foundation day under the banner of its frontal organisation, Rashtravadi Kisan Sangthan, at Belaur village under the Udwant Nagar Police station of Bhojpur district on Tuesday while the custodians of law maintained ""order"" at the meeting venue and remained mute spectators.

Founded at the same Belaur village on October 8, 1994, the Sena was banned by the state government in August, 1995, following the Sarathna massacre in which six Dalits of Musahar Caste were gunned down after midnight on July 25-26, 1995, by the Sena men.

This year''s function was held in the absence of former Sena chief Brahmeshwar Singh alias Mukhiyajee as he is behind the bars following his arrest by the Patna police on August 29 this year.

Tuesday''s celebrations started with ""puja"" at Baba Ranvir temple located at Belaur where delegates from different parts of the state participated. They vowed to complete the construction of Baba''s temple.

Speakers, at the meeting held later, expressed their anguish over the arrest of Sena chief and the administrative failure in safeguarding the interests of the farmers. One of the speakers, Chandrama Chaudhary, said: ""Our youths have given many sacrifices as a result of which we are known Ranvir Sena. We have pride on our strength.""

Amidst thunderous applause, he said Mukhiyajee will be released from jail soon. He maintained that some vested interests have joined the Sena but the Sena would not be disbanded.

Mahendra Roy of village Kurmuri said: ""If the government and the district administration believes us as extremists, then we are Ranvirs, while we are patriotic farmers is a true sense.""

Sarita Devi of village Sehari (Gaya) referred to the Sena chief as Hanuman and said: ""Now we have to snatch our rights from the administration."" Parvati Devi of Jehanabad said that women have to play the role of ""Jhansi Ki Rani"" to wage a war against oppression and atrocity on them. Presiding over the meet, Vijendra Choudhary alleged that the extremist of the CPI(ML) were moving freely under the patronage of the district administration and police were harassing the innocent farmers instead. No efforts are being made by the administration to arrest the ""ML extremists"", he alleged.

Earlier, the meet began with the presentation of a ""revolutionary"" songs by Ranjan Choudhary. Former block pramukh of Udwantnagar Bhuneshwar Singh, mukhiya of Belaur panchayat Shiv Bhushan Chudhary, mukhiya of Bagwan panchayat Vinod Singh, president of RKS, Gaya unit, Ram Janam Sharma, member of the Bhojpur district board, Chandradeo Ram and several others addressed the meet in the presence of police force.

6,Saw mill owners are sore over govt directive,"BHAGALPUR: The district forest officer (DFO) of the Banka forest division, Sunil Kumar Thakur, has created a record of sorts by issuing the licence for a saw mill to a five-year-old boy Vikram Singh of Dhoraiya village under the Rajoun block of the Banka district.Whereas the DFO has shown exemplary promptness in issuing license to the child, the licence of a pre-independence saw mill located in the personal forest of the Khadi Gramodyog have not been renewed and it is closed. Besides, the saw mill of a riot-afflicted widow Bibi Mustari Begum near Bhikhanpur was also reportedly closed without giving any show cause notice in this connection. Incidentally, Mustari's Bharat Saw Mill is the only mill allotted to a woman in the district.If the saw mill owners from the Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Katihar and Khagaria districts are to be believed, the forest officials in these districts are taking advantage of the recent directives of the state government to lower down the number of saw mills by providing the new licences in the rural and urban areas proportional to the population and wood availability of the related areas.The recent directives of the state government for closure of the saw mills on the basis of population density has created discontent among the sawmill owners here.According to the sources, the recent directives restrict the number of saw mill to one for 80,000 people in a block. In the municipal as well as notified areas, one sawmill is allowed for 20,000 population. The sources further said that earlier the number of saw mills were quite high.Recently, a dharna was staged under the auspices of Vishwakarma Kayastha Shilpi Vikas Samiti at the Bhagalpur collectorate premises, in which the disgruntled saw mill owners charged the Banka district magistrate as well as the district forest officer, for adopting double standards while renewing the permits of the old saw mills.Ramsewak Sharma, the state secretary of the Vishwakarma Kayastha Shilpi Vikas Samiti, said recently saw mill license no. 1/26.8.2002 and 2/26.8.2002 were issued against the directives of the state government. Rajendra Yadav, the district unit chief of the organisation, said that earlier there were more than 60 mills in the Bhagalpur district, which is now reduced to 45.

7,Three murdered in separate incidents,"HYDERABAD: Unrequited love, marital discord and business rivalry resulted in the murder of three persons, including two women, in separate incidents here on Thursday. Two of the victims were killed in daylight at public places.

8,Cong to discuss govt formation in J&K on Friday,"NEW DELHI: With the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls throwing up a hung verdict, the Congress Working Committee is meeting here on Friday night to discuss the issue of government formation in the state.

Congress, which has secured 20 seats and emerged as the second largest party, is expected to deliberate on the nitty-gritty of government formation at the meeting to be presided by party president Sonia Gandhi.

Gandhi left for Rajasthan on Friday morning and is expected to be back by evening to attend the CWC meeting. She would return to Rajasthan on Saturday morning to complete her two-day tour to the desert state, party sources said.

J&K PCC president Gulam Nabi Azad is also expected to arrive in the capital by evening for consultation with central leaders.

Congress leaders have been cautious on the issue of government formation as also who will be the chief minister despite the fact that the party had projected Azad as its chief ministerial candidate during the elections.

However, it maintained that there would be no problem in government formation along with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed led People''s Democratic Party and with the help of other likeminded parties and Independents.

With 28 members, the NC does not appear to be in any position to form the next government.

The Congress, riding on a wave in the Jammu region, and PDP with 16 seats, emerged as the likely coalition partners, but they will require at least eight MLAs from among the independents and smaller parties to touch the majority figure of 44 in the 87-member assembly.

10,Panthers Party too joins race for J&K govt formation,"JAMMU: In an interesting development, Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP) on Friday joined the race for government formation, saying it would seek support from like-minded parties for this purpose.

""We will like to seek support from secular parties like the Congress, People''s Democratic Party (PDP) and CPM in forming government though our strength is just four in the newly-elected assembly,"" JKNPP president Bhim Singh told reporters here.

Asked whether his party had received any feelers from the Congress or PDP in formation of the government, he said these matters would be first discussed in the party''s executive.

He said that in the event of any differences between the Congress and PDP on the issue of chief ministership, JKNPP could be a deciding factor in resolving the crisis.

Attributing the defeat of National Conference to rejection of Kashmiri leadership, Singh said that the party''s misgovernance led to alienation and resentment among the common people.

""Our party''s main thrust will be on tackling militancy, giving due share to all three regions of the state and creation of Jammu Himalayan state,"" he added.

11,CWC to discuss party's J&K strategy,"NEW DELHI: With the focus in Jammu and Kashmir shifting to government formation, the Congress Working Committee will discuss the partyâ€™s strategy in the state on Friday evening.

A Congress-Peoples Democratic Party alliance is on the cards, but it is early days yet. For one, the two parties together have 36 seats in the 87-member J&K Assembly, still eight short of the halfway mark and will need the support of smaller parties and independents. Several of these have, however, already indicated they are ready to talk.

Panthers Party chief Bhim Singh met Congress president Sonia Gandhi here after the election results . Bhim Singhâ€™s party has four seats in the new Assembly.

The chief ministership in a possible coalition is a crucial issue, with the PDP hinting that the person at the helm of affairs should be from the Kashmir Valley. The Congress has got most of its seats from the Jammu region.

In Srinagar, both Azad and PDP Vice-President Mehbooba Mufti told newspersons that the chief ministership issue would not be a problem. The Congressâ€™ man of the moment is in the Capital now for the CWC meet after initial confabulations in the Valley.

The partyâ€™s highest decision making body will meet at 8 pm to discuss how to go about government formation. There are various views on the issue in the party, especially given the present fluid situation. While most leaders believe that the party should form the government with a CM of its own, given the fact that it will be the senior partner in the coalition with 20 seats, there are some sections that feel the party could consider offering outside support to a PDP-led government.

The argument for this is that J&K is untested grounds for the party, which had given the National Conference a long rope for all the time that it (the Congress) was in power at the Centre. The militancy issue is tricky and, some leaders feel, the PDP may be better equipped to deal with the feeling of alienation in the Valley.

Sonia Gandhi, who will preside over the CWC meeting, left for Rajasthan on Friday and will return in the evening, only to go back to Rajasthan on Saturday morning. She is on a two-day tour of the state.

14,KAT order on civil service selection list set aside,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka High Court on Friday allowed in part the writ petitions filed by Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC), and set aside the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal (KAT) order nullifying the selection list notified by KPSC for appointment of gazetted A and B posts in the state civil service.

Justice R.V. Raveendran and Justice K.L. Manjunath on Friday partly allowed the writ petitions and directed the KPSC to redo the selection on the basis of moderation of marks and revaluation of answerscripts of candidates in the competitive exam held for the selection. The bench set detailed guidelines for the same.

On March 9, 1998, the KPSC notified 415 posts of gazetted A and B posts in the the state civil service and invited applications from candidates. Thereafter, it held a competitive exam and finally published the list of selected candidates on September 28, 2001.

K. Linganna and other unsuccessful candidates questioned the legality and propriety of the selections before the High Court in writ petitions, and they were transferred to KAT for disposal. The KAT, after a hearing, allowed the applications on February 2, 2002, and quashed the list, directing KPSC to redo the list after revaluation of answer scripts.

The KPSC and some of the selected candidates challenged the KAT order in the HC, contending that the direction to revalue answer scripts was illegal and that the selected candidates were not made parties before the KAT and no opportunity was afforded to before the tribunal.

The principal opposition to the selection was that valuation was illegal and irregular. For instance, the petitioners alleged that four top ranks were given to the members of one family.

After discussion, the Bench set guidelines to redo the selection. The court said the KAT secretary has to moderate on the subjects listed in the judgment on a two-tier system selecting examiners for the purpose, as per the memo submitted to the court on March 27, 2002, and thereafter notify selections as per law.

16,Gujaratis look forward to UK increase in foreign workers,"AHMEDABAD: Plans for a big increase in the number of foreign workers allowed legally into Britain will act as a new gateway to thousands of people seeking to settle in the UK, says a press note by MigrationWatch UK, an independent and non-political body established in October 2001.

The UK home office has announced that it hopes to issue a record number of 1,75,000 work permits next year. This compares to around 30,000 annually throughout most of the 1990s, though the numbers have risen dramatically in recent years. The UK government wants this upward trend to continue, opening up the country to legitimate economic migration to boost growth and to deter those who are using asylum as a back-door route into the country.

UK home office statistics issued this week show more work permit holders coming to UK show that 108,825 work permit holders and their dependants admitted in 2001, 19 per cent higher than in 2000 and continuing the historical upward trend, and 339,000 students were admitted in 2001, 8 per cent more than in 2000. More than 51,415, that is 65 per cent more than the last year were granted extensions of stay for work.

Commenting on the statistics, the UK''s immigration minister Beverley Hughes said, ""These statistics should help dispel the myth of a Fortress Britain. They are testimony to the effectiveness of the UK''s modernised and streamlined work permits system, which enables increasing numbers of non-EEA nationals to come here to work legally,"" home office press note says.

Summary on Work Permits and Immigration by Migration Watch notes that it is expected that approximately 134,000 permits will be issued in 2002. Migration Watch UK estimates that the 2002 levels of permits issue will lead to approximately 62,000 people (permit holders and their dependants) settling in the UK. If the Government reaches its target of issuing 175,000 permits in 2003 the resultant number of people settling in 2007 could be as many as 81,000 compared to 9,500 in recent years. The officials of Migrationwatch UK, however say that this policy will not help to decrease inflow of illegal immigrants as the government hopes. The Government has simply not thought through their policy, they say.

The expansion in work permits has been criticised both for failing to tackle skills shortages in Britain and for encouraging trained workers to leave the third world countries that need them most. However, the Government is determined to streamline the work permit system so that it could ensure that the UK has the people it needs to prosper in the world economy. And to open up opportunities to allow people who want to work in the UK.

The broad eligibility criteria for obtaining a work permit are that employers need to demonstrate they have a trading presence in the UK and there must be a genuine vacancy in the UK.

With this, there has been a reduction in the time for processing applications, a much lower application rejection rate and a significant proportion of permits being approved for shortage occupations. In 2000 the primary occupation of those granted work permits was health professionals and associate professionals which is 24 per cent of the total applications processed. 21 per cent were for managers and administrators, 16 per cent for computer analysts and programmers, 10 per cent for engineers and technologists, 8 per cent were for business and financial professionals and 7 per cent for teachers.

17,Man posing as CBI officer arrested,"AHMEDABAD: The Naranpura police on Friday arrested one Himanshu Kantilal Rawal (40), for posing as a CBI official. Rawal was caught when he was trying to dupe officials at the Bavda Co-operative Bank in Naranpura.

Rawal first visited the bank on Wednesday, where he flashed his fake identity card, which showed him as a ""special investigating officer"" with the CBI, New Delhi. He told the bank officials that his job was to crack the fake currency notes racket encompassing co-operative banks in Gujarat.

Convinced by his act the bank authorities allowed Rawal to check currency notes with the bank. Rawal pretended that he had detected flaws in 66 Rs 100 notes and one Rs 500 note. These he set aside and told the bank authorities that these notes will have to be taken to New Delhi as ""evidences"" for further testing.

In return for the custody of these ""fake"" notes, Rawal gave the bank authorities a letter on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. However when Rawal returned on Friday to collect the booty, a team of police officials, led by the Naranpura police inspector V D Vanar and PSI M N Vankar arrested him.

A toy pistol, a fake ID card and some fake documents were recovered from Rawal''s possession. Police investigations have revealed that Rawal, a resident of Memnagar, has been working as the keeper of a factory godown at Patel Estate in Aslali.

Police say that prior to this, Rawal had tried to loot audio-cassette shops in the Satellite area posing as a police constable. In the past, he had been arrested for similar offences in Maninagar and Karanj police station areas.

18,Local body elections postponed again in Gujarat,"GANDHINAGAR: The BJP government on Friday again used their powers to postpone the elections for 88 municipalities, two district panchayats (Kheda and Banaskantha) and 15 taluka panchayats for four more months. The important decision acquires significance as it comes one day after the crushing defeat of the BJP in the J&K assembly elections.

Two separate notifications, issued by the state urban development department and the panchayat department on Friday, said that the revision of the electoral rolls currently being undertaken by the Central Election Commission was the reason behind the postponement. The last time the polls for the municipalities and the panchayats were postponed was in June 2002, citing ""ensuing monsoon"" as the reason.

While the municipality elections were postponed for the fifth time, those of the panachayats were postponed for the third time. The municipal elections were postponed first in November 2000 using drought as the pretext, then in March 2001 due to the earthquake, again in March 2002 due to the riots and finally in June 2002. The panchayat polls have not been held since March 2001.

Top Sachivalaya officials conceded that the polls were postponed despite the fact that the bureaucrats had recommended that the elections could be held immediately. The polls for municipalities will now be held after 25 months. ""The government took the decision for postponement despite the official view to the contrary,"" an insider told TNN here on condition of anonymity.

Officials said, after the electoral rolls are finalised, a separate revision would have to be undertaken for the municipality and panchayat constituencies, and this would take time. The Central Election Commission has suggested that it would finalise the rolls by October 15. According to the two notifications issued on Friday, there would be no municipality or panchayat polls till February 11, next year.

Sources in the Sachivalaya suspect that the state BJP rulers'' reason for postponing the polls is to see how the BJP fares in the assembly elections, before going in for municipality and panchayat elections. The state government held gram panchayat polls a few months back as here political parties do not play a major role.

19,State awards 31 projects for core sector development,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has awarded a total of 31 projects estimated at Rs 42,935 crore to private sector and joint sector for infrastructure implementation under the ''Vision 2010 programme''. These 31 projects are out of a total of 383 projects worth Rs 1,16,993 crore as envisaged.

Already, nearly 13 projects costing Rs 2,269 crore have been implemented, stated Rajesh Kishore, CEO of Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board (GIDB) while delivering the key-note address at a seminar on ''Facilitating Infrastructure: Action Agenda for Gujarat''. The seminar was organised by the Gujarat Council of Confederation of Indian Industry and GIDB.

Besides, nearly 124 projects outside the ''Vision 2010 programme'' require investments to the tune of Rs 22,098 crore. ""The ''Vision 2010 programme'' was chalked out based on the costs and requirements that were prevailing during 1998 and a review on both the fronts is required now,"" he added.

Nitin Shukla, chairman of CII Gujarat, said that the goal of eight per cent GDP growth and increasing India''s share of global trade from 2 to 4 per cent can be achieved only if proper infrastructure is put in place. Gujarat was the pioneer in introducing the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act in October 1999. But, lot more needs to be done to improve infrastructure. As the reforms process at the state level has slowed down, there is scarcity of funds and there is still no one-point agency for speedy clearance for setting up industries.

Nayan Parikh, chairman of CII Gujarat''s infrastructure group, said that the state has done very well in development of ports but it has a long way to go in power and other infrastructure areas. ""As against Rs 12,288 crore investments in ports planned by 2010 under the ''Vision 2010 programme'', the state has already seen inflows of Rs 17,000 crore. Now, the need is not for more ports, but greater efficiency at existing ones and road linkages to Punjab in the north,"" he said.

P N Roychowdhury, CEO of Gujarat Maritime Board, said that the port sector in the state has met with good success even before the BOT laws were put in place. ""Total traffic handled by ports in Gujarat has risen from 20-23 million tonnes five years back to 90 million tonnes currently. Captive jetties were the major contributor for this growth. Private ports at Mundra and Pipavav have also added to this growth. Substantial growth will come in future with the completion of the LNG terminals and ports by Shell and Petronet LNG,"" he said.

Sanjay Sinha, director of Crisil, said that while India spends around 5.5 per cent of its GDP on infrastructure, the East Asian countries use about 10 per cent of GDP. ""In India, nearly 80 per cent of infrastructure investments are made by government organisations and PSUs. More participation from the private sector is required,"" he added.

20,"State govt snaps phone connections of cops, babus","AHMEDABAD: The state government gave a rude shock to bureaucrats at the Secretariat and IPS officials at the Police Bhavan on Thursday by snapping off all their phone connections subscribed from BSNL, reportedly on account of ""austerity measures"".

While the shock only confirmed the state government''s financial condition, several officers from the Sachivalaya as well as the Police Bhavan are said to have protested the move since ""it had virtually cut them off from the public"". Top sources in the Sachivalaya hinted at extreme pressures from the finance department to cancel the STD connections of these officials.

Instead, the state government has got installed some 6,000 connection of the Tata telecom services ""which exempts the rental charges and renders the calls between two Tata lines absolutely free"", sources told TNN.

""A decision has been taken to cancel all lines of the Department of Telecom (DoT) and replace them with Tata lines,"" sources said.

The General Administration Department is said to have forwarded at the outset, a list of at least 400 numbers of various departments of the government to the BSNL for cancellation of the connections. However, top sources revealed that these connections had been restored at the secretary level of IAS and Inspector-General level of IPS officers.

When contacted, sources in the GAD said that ""it was a part of the austerity measures"", although no official was willing to talk about it openly. The move is expected to save upto Rs 2 crore for the state government.

By Friday, only one BSNL line of the Director-General of Police K Chakravarthi was working apart from the control rooms of the state and the Intelligence Bureau. However, police officials maintained that ""only some of the lines had been snapped"".

When contacted, Chakravarthi said, ""We''ll look into it."" According to Secretariat sources, all officers from the level of deputy secretary and above had been given STD lines where the deputy secretaries were allowed 1,000 calls while secretaries were allowed indefinite calls.

Sources disclosed that the state government had considered the benefits offered by the private firm and opted for it. ""At least 60 per cent of the calls are internal and they will be absolutely free, and STD rates will be charged only on calls made from Tata lines to DoT,"" an official disclosed. Right now the state government was paying Rs 360 as bi-monthly rentals on each BSNL line. However, officers were heard complaining about the difficult maintenance of the Tata phone lines vis-a-vis the DoT lines.
