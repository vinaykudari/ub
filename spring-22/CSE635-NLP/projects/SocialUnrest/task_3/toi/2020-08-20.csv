0,"MSRDC delays flyover, traffic snarls increase","PUNE: Delay in construction of the much-hyped Rs 6.66 crore flyover on Shankarseth Road is resulting into frequent traffic snarls and accidents on the heavily congested road. A brainchild of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), the flyover was supposed to be open for public in May 2003.

Worse still, lashing rains, deadly potholes and construction rubble jutting out at various points along the flyover has made driving a dreadful experience on the ill-maintained Shankarseth Road.

MSRDC executive engineer A S Pande told TNN on Wednesday that construction works of flyover began on January 17, 2002. â€œWe were supposed to complete the flyover within 15 months. But work has been delayed because the civic authorities had not shifted the underground water, telephone and electricity lines,â€� Pande said.

Meanwhile, irate daily commuters and residents complained that they were left to the mercy of noise pollution, dust clouds, construction rubble and arrogant officials for last one year.

A teacher from Moledina High School told TNN that for the past one year, they were bogged down by dust clouds and noise pollution. â€œEvery few hours, the classrooms and writing desks get covered with dust. Being a national highway, the traffic scene is horrendous from morning to night, particularly from 9 am to 11.30 am and from 5.30 pm to 10.30 pm in the evening,â€� the teacher said.

Suhas Gaikwad, a daily commuter who met with an accident last month owing to an unattended pothole, said that, MSRDC should expedite the construction work of the flyover. â€œLikewise, Pune Municipal Corporation should embrace their responsibility and at least have the decency to maintain the existing road, unless they want some more fatal accidents,â€� Gaikwad said.

Admitting the inconvenience caused to daily commuters, Pande said MSRDC would complete the flyover by October 2003. â€œWe are in the final stage of completing the flyover. Now, only the central box girder work is remaining,â€� Pande said.

Total cost of the four-lane flyover which is 624.24 meter in length and 17.2 metre in width is Rs 6.66 crore. And so far, MSRDC has spent approximately Rs 5. 59 crore.

1,Power projects in limbo due to govt apathy,"PATNA: Four Centrally-sponsored mega power projects of Bihar worth nearly Rs 1,156 crore are likely to remain in limbo due to the apathetic attitude of the state government.

These four projects are: strengthening of the power transmission network and reforming the distribution sector in the north and south Bihar plains, Mahatma Gandhi Setu cable-laying project (132 kV) connecting north Bihar, electrification of 2,600 villages in Vaishali and Muzaffarpur districts and ""cent per cent metering"" of 15 circles under the Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme.

All the four projects are to be executed by the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL). The funds meant for these projects would be directly routed through the PGCIL. Due to the inordinate delay in the implementation of these projects, their estimated cost is likely to increase due to price escalation.

These power projects are awaiting clearance from the state government. Only last week, the government raised some objections to the consultancy fee to be charged by the PGCIL.

In view of the importance of the projects, the PGCIL has already assigned its two executive directors at the headquarters to monitor the developments, besides setting up a separate office at Nageshwar Colony in Patna.

According to sources, construction work on the strengthening of power transmission network, which was scheduled to start by the first week of March, has got delayed due to the delay in signing of the MoU. The tenders for the project have already been finalised. The Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) will supervise and monitor the project.

The Planning Commission has already agreed to give a grant of Rs 367 crore, including the service charge of 15 per cent, to the PGCIL for the project''s implementation.

The PGCIL has agreed to complete the project within a year and a half from the day of its launching. Under this project, 1,100 km of lines will be laid, including 22 new ones, and 18 new power sub-stations set up in different parts of the state.

According to the PGCIL proposal, Rs 225.29 crore will be spent in north Bihar and Rs 80.01 crore in south Bihar. Central funds will be routed through the PGCIL.

The ambitious project of ""cent per cent metering"" in 15 power circles of Bihar, including two of the Patna Electric Supply Undertaking, is yet to take off due the non-signing of MoU. The PGCIL has been assigned the job of executing the ""100 per cent metering"" project on behalf of the BSEB, and the funds for the project would be routed through the PGCIL, said an official.

The rural electrification in Vaishali and Muzaffarpur districts is also held up due to the non-signing of MoU with the state government. The estimated cost of this project is Rs 120 crore.

2,Stir verdict: Unions to plan protests,"HYDERABAD: Major trade unions will be meeting in Delhi on Friday to firm up protest plans against the recent Supreme Court''s observation on strikes, according to All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta.

Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Dasgupta said that their stand was vindicated by attorney general Soli J Sorabjee''s observation that: ""Apex court judgment was beyond comprehension. Right to strike was recognised by many democratic countries."" ""The Supreme Court might have been influenced by the economic policies being pursued by the government and its pronouncement was biased as it did not take the plight of workers and causes of strike into consideration for its observations,"" he said.

The AITUC leader said that the judgment ""negates the statutory provisions of the Industrial disputes Act and the ILO convention."" The AITUC would raise the issue at the ILO conference. The government should amend Constitution to facilitate provision for â€˜collective bargaining'' and negate the court''s observations, Dasgupta added.

Dasgupta said the trade unions would wage a relentless battle to secure workers their ""due rights."" The SC observations would rob the workers their right to protest and nobody can take away the rights of workers, he added. The Centre should also make its position clear on the apex court''s observations, the AITUC leader said.

AITUC deputy general secretary H Mahadevan, AITUC (AP council) general secretary Potluri Nageswara Rao were present.

3,BJP criticises Krishna's statement on farmers,"BANGALORE: The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday took exception to Chief Minister S M Krishna''s statement that his government cannot issue a `farmaan'' (dictum) asking farmers not to borrow loans and said it smacked of callousness.

Speaking to reporters, leader of the opposition the legislative assembly, Jagadish Shettar said the statement was unbecoming of a chief minister. Instead of intiating confidence building measures, Krishna is only trying to shift the blame.

""Despite farmers committing suicides in large numbers, the government is not responding to their plight. No government representative has visited any of the farmers families. It shows how indifferent the government is about farmers issues,"" he said. The government should investigate the reasons for the suicides and take appropriate action.

On Tuesday, Krishna said farmers should have the confidence to repay loans after borrowing loans. The government cannot ask farmers not to borrow loans.

Shettar said the government did not clarify its stand on protecting the interest of the employees who have been axed after the Supreme Court scrapped rural weightage based employment. It was also not clear in its stand on resolving the CET admission imbroglio.

""This reflects the state government''s lack of clarity in resolving burning problems of the people,"" he added.

4,HC pulls up govt on panchayat issue,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Tuesday directed the state government to allow the threetier panchayat raj institutions (PRIs) to function as local self-government as per constitutional provisions or face the constitutional consequences.

Hearing on a PIL filed by the Bihar Rajya Panchayat Parishad for allocation of 29 subjects mentioned in the 11th Schedule of the Constitution and Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 1993, with devolution of powers/rights and funds, a division bench, comprising of CJ Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh, gave two weeks'' time to the state government with the warning that the time has come when the court has to order in writing that the state government is not functioning as per the constitutional provisions.

On the next date of hearing, the state government has to submit before the court that it has handed over all the 29 subjects to the PRIs, the CJ said.

Earlier, the bench did not appear to be satisfied with the contents of the counter affidavit filed by rural development department (panchayat raj) secretary Jayant Dasgupta and observed that the PRIs have still been deprived of its rights/responsibilities and necessary funds for the execution of different developmental schemes by the state government.

Standing counsel Alamdar Hussain said that Dasgupta has clearly stated in his counter affidavit that after elections of the PRIs in April-May 2001-02, the departments of the state government have already devolved powers and functions to the PRIs on 25 of the 29 subjects mentioned in the Constitution.

6,Singhal ties holy threads to party workers,"MOHANLALGANJ, Lucknow: The event was unexpected and unplanned. True. Till then, not many knew what Ram Raksha Sootra was all about. But the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) international working president Ashok Singhal seemed more than prepared when he handed a bag containing a stout bunch of Kalawa (holy threads worn around the wrist) to a party worker.

""We all carry this with us when ever we visit Awadh Prant,"" he said smilingly as he began to outline then mood of the village folks on the Ram temple issue. ""You come with us and yourself see how angry they (village folks) are on the hidnrances in the way of temple construction,"" he said adding that the VHP plans to pass the Ram Raksha Sootra to 8000 of the 13500 known villages of Awadh Prant, which engulfs the temple city of Ayodhya and continue to fan out to the rest of the nation and even beyond till the temple is brought up at the Ram Janam Bhoomi site.

But why this sudden decision to hold the event unannounced? Singhal was clear as BN Shukla, the Awadh Prant working president elaborated, ""Purchased from Allahabad in truck loads, the Kalewa was taken to Ayodhya over a month ago when a Yagya was being performed there."" Shukla said that the Kalawa was included in the Pujan and then sent to all the provinces across the nation. ""So this is not an unplanned event,"" Singhal clearified.

On what prompted to start the campaign from Lucknow and that too on Janamashthami, Singhal revealed, ""It was this day in 1964 that VHP was founded and what better a way can there be than starting such a sacred movement to mark the Sthapna Diwas of the Parishad."" ""And interestingly, the day VHP was founded in 1964, Janam Ashthami was celebrated on August 20 and today also is the same calender date,"" pointed out organising secretary of the Awadh Prant unit of the Parishad.

About the choice of village, the VHP international working president informed, ""In the days to come all major events of the VHP will originate from Lucknow itself and as the senior leaders would visit this place and so can monitor the pace of the Ram Raksha Sootra campaign as well."" On the programmes slated to be held, Singhal said that an Uchya Adhikari Samiti Baithak along with the Marg Darshak Samiti has been convened on September 13 next to finalise the events and the programme schedule.

7,"Uplinking rules to be reworked, says govt","NEW DELHI: The government is to rework the guidelines governing uplinking facilities to be granted to foreign television networks. Changing the FDI norms for firms engaged in Indian operations is also on the cards taking the experience with Star as the yardstick. Star was the first applicant under this category.

Under the FDI norms applicable to the print media, an Indian entity needs to have at least 51 per cent stake. The message that went out of the first meeting of the group of ministers (GoM) on Wednesday was that the guidelines should ensure adherence ""in letter and spirit"" and avoid any circumvention.

At the GoM meeting, finance minister Jaswant Singh and law minister Arun Jaitley were understood to have conveyed the government''s broad intention to information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the third GoM member.

Prasad''s ministry, which has identified several areas of concern in Star''s application, will undertake the task of reworking the guidelines on uplinking to make it ""foolproof"", sources said. Pending completion of the exercise, Star News would continue to uplink its material from its headquarters in Hong Kong as per the current arrangement.

The government also expects Star to utilise the time to alter its corporate infrastructure in India to adhere to the norms decided as per the guidelines framed in March this year, sources said.

The GoM is likely to meet again shortly to examine the reworked guidelines. There may also be consultations with the PMO.

The PM and his deputy have been involved in the deliberations at different stages. Both have received representations from Star, as also other media organisations on the issue.

The government has been wary of the firm MCCS, floated by Star, as a front company with no editorial control and power to appoint or raise equity. Star''s voluminous response to the government''s queries have so far not led to clarity. The government feels there is almost a conclusive circumvention of the guidelines through a series of ``interesting financial arrangements'''' through backend companies, sources alleged.

8,Anti-bandh CU workers halt work a day early,"KOLKATA: Stalling work protest against a possible suspension of work the next day can only happen in Calcutta University, where the work culture is not something to write home about.

Between 2 pm and 4 pm Wednesday, several departments of the universityâ€™s College Street campus wore a deserted look. The reason: the employees, under the banner of Calcutta University Employees Association, were busy rallying support against the Bangla bandh Thursday called by the SUCI.

While the members of the association urged their colleagues to come to work Thursday and foil the Bangla bandh, over 100 employees participated in the demonstration.

There was no respite even for students appearing for examinations in the Darbhanga and Ashutosh Building as the protesters shouted slogans and marched through the university corridors.

Work was suspended for over two hours due to the protest march followed speeches by association members. In the registration, migration and controller examination departments, only a fraction of the staff were present. The library, too, was short-staffed. Teachers, who were on examination duty, were appalled by the behaviour the university staff. â€œThey should have at least spared thought for the students appearing for exams,â€� said teacher on invigilation duty in Ashutosh Building.

9,"Transporters, govt gear up for showdown","KOLKATA: The West Bengal government and transport owners are gearing up for a showdown as transport minister Subhas Chakroborty on Wednesday asked bus and mini bus workers â€˜to defy owners and foilâ€™ the 72 hour- transport strike from August 26.

As talks failed between the two sides on the new motor vehicles tax re-gime, Chakroborty threatened in Kolkata to take over private buses and mini buses in â€˜public interestâ€™ if the transporters remain â€˜stubborn on the unjustified strikeâ€™.

Leaders of 11 transport unions said they would go ahead with the pro-posed 72-hour strike as they were â€˜unhappy and angry with the ministerâ€™s â€œlack of honest effortâ€� to end the deadlock. The transporters met Chakraborty, as well as senior home department and olice officials during the day.

â€œThe transporters had complained about police and motor vehicles harassment. The meeting was arranged for mutual understanding. Some of their grievances were not baseless and would be redressed suitably,â€™â€™ said the minister.

He also announced the formation of aa 17 member committee comprising transporters and departmental representatives to review the new vehicle taxes. The committee will submit the report by September and the gov-ernment would decide its stand on by September 10.

Chakroborty also indicated that he would be ready to roll back some of the new tax slabs while justifying the rest of the increase as reasonable. â€œThough I have taken such initiatives, the transporters did not bother to think over my appeal to call off the strike. I do not like it and urge the workers involved in passengers transport to defy their stubborn owners and run the vehicles to foil the strike in public interest,â€™â€™ he said. A visibly peeved minister declared that government would take all possible legal steps to ensure public conveyance.

10,HC tells cops to enforce parking rules,"KOLKATA: To ensure free movement of traffic and for safety of the public, the Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed the authorities to maintain and enforce no parking rules in Kolkata.

Disposing of a writ petition by Ujjwal Dutta, an advocate of the Calcutta High Court, alleging violation of no parking rules at the busy four-point intersection of Chandi Ghosh Road, Chanditala Lane and M.N. Sen Lane in South Kolkata, justice Maharaja Sinha directed the police, particularly traffic inspector of Jadavpur Traffic Guard to adopt permanent measures to maintain no parking signs and and enforce no parking rules.

Near the four-point intersection there were more than one educational institutions for boys and girls.

For illegal parking of vehicles, particularly taxis, severe traffic jam occurred frequently, causing trouble to commuters.

They lodged several complaints with police, but no action was taken by them.

They even gave representation to the deputy commissioner traffic but in vein. Vehicles continued to park in the area, Roy alleged.

11,"Bengal, Bihar bandhs to severely hit train services","KOLKATA : There are difficult times in store for long distance train passengers passing through Bihar and West Bengal on Thursday, because of a bandh call in both the states.

Among the major long distance trains likely to be held up at various points are the Rajdhani Express, Purva Express and Kalka Mail from Delhi.

The Gitanjali Express and other trains from Mumbai, the Coromandel Express from Chennai and Shatabdi and Jan Shatabdi Expresses to Ranchi, from Patna and Malda are also likely to be affected.

â€œWe are not cancelling any train at the moment. However, normal services will depend upon the timely arrival of rakes,â€� South Eastern Railway officials said.

Of the suburban services, the Sealdah division of Eastern Railway is likely to be the worst hit. â€œThe areas around Joynagar and other stations in South 24-Parganas have a history of disruption during bandhs. Banana leaves are thrown on overhead traction lines and bandh supporters squat on tracks.,â€� Eastern Railway sources said.

The disruption is likely to be worse in Bihar where the CPI(M-L) Liberation has called a Bihar bandh. The party is also supporting the SUCI â€” sponsored bandh in West Bengal.

12,‘Rangdars’ rule the roost,"GAYA: The dare-devil manner in which extortionists whisked away a telephone booth owner at gun point from a busy commercial area following his refusal to pay Rs 20,000 as protection money and the series of explosions in different localities of the town to terrorise the recipients of demand notes has come as a major challenge to the Gaya police as the town has virtually been held to ransom by the new breed of criminals targeting even low income group people for a few thousand rupees.

Kidnapping of the telephone booth owner on Monday is not an isolated incident. Earlier, series of explosions created panic in the Swarajpuri Road and Bari Road areas as they were aimed at terrorising a petty medicine retailer, owners of a dhaba and a hair-cutting saloon, all of whom have received demand notes from the new recruits of the crime world.

Besides the kidnapping of the telephone booth operator and explosions outside some business establishments, the criminals on Saturday evening robbed a college teacher and some others near the Railway Quarters.

The victims of the criminals also include a visitor who was robbed of nearly Rs 16,000 near the Creane School on Saturday morning.

Conceding that the activities of the criminals were a cause of concern and the new trend of extorting money even from the not-so-affluent, Gaya superintendent of police Sanjay Singh complained that the victims were not lending the desired cooperation to the police. Without public cooperation, particularly the cooperation of the recipients of the demand notes and other victims, the police can not achieve good results, he said.

Refuting the SPâ€™s complaint, activist Shree Bhagwan Bhaskar says that if people do not go to the police and reveal their trauma, it means that they do not have enough confidence in policemen. In many cases, the woes of the victims only goes up if they approach the police and enough has not been done to win their confidence, added Bhaskar.

Sanjay Singh also claimed that he was trying his best to rein in the criminals but shortage of police personnel and the narrowness of Gaya lanes and bylanes came in the way of effective policing.

Even by the police head quarter parameters, the district did have 500 less policemen than the minimum requirement, he said.

The CPM has described the bandh as ""uncalled for and politically-motivated"".

The Trinamul Congress has provided tacit support to the bandh saying, it supported the issues over which it had been called.

18,Normal life affected by Bengal bandh,"KOLKATA: Normal life was affected in Kolkata on Thursday because of a 24-hour West Bengal bandh called by the Socialist Unity Centre of India. The CPI(M-L) Liberation also issued a parallel bandh call during the day.

The police said that a total of 150 SUCI supporters were arrested in different parts of the city for trying to obstruct traffic. SUCI supporters marched in processions and started squatting on important road junctions like Hazra Road crossing, Chandni Chowk, Shyambazar and Baguiati. Waiting policemen swung into action and chased them away.

Shops and markets were mostly closed in the city and traffic on the roads was thin. State buses and trams plied in large numbers, some private buses and mini buses also operated.

Taxis were, however, absent from the roads. Schools and colleges were mostly closed. Though bank branches were open, there were hardly any customers. Train services were disrupted in the Sealdah South section.

The SUCI had called the bandh against ""anti-people measures of the ruling Left Front,"" like increasing hospital charges, electricity tariff and tuition fees in colleges and the introduction of capitation fee in medical education.

The ruling CPM had opposed the bandh call. In fact, groups of CPM supporters were present in street corners during the day, to foil the bandh. The Trinamul Congress had extended a tacit support, stating they agreed with the issues on which the bandh had been called and would do nothing to oppose the bandh.

19,Simultaneous polls unconstitutional: Chautala,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala has described Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s proposal regarding holding of Lok Sabha and Assembly elections simultaneously as ""unconstitutional"".

The Chief Minister, who was speaking at a press conference here on Thursday, observed that even the amendment of the Constitution for the purpose would not be an easy task because the Centre would have to have the consent of state governments.

""Every government is elected for a period of five years and it is their constitutional right to remain in power for that period. And no state government will like its term to be cut short,"" said Chautala.

Meanwhile, when asked as to what was the latest position regarding the Satluj-Yamuna Link Canal (SYL) controversy, Chautala said that the Haryana government had sent its proposals to the Supreme Court under which it had urged the apex court that the Centre should get the Punjab portion of the canal completed through Border Roads Organisation (BRO) under a time-bound programme.

The court has now given four weeks to both the Centre and Punjab government to decide as to how best the canal could be made functional.

21,Book criminal case against minister:YSR,"HYDERABAD: Opposition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy has demanded that the government book criminal case against employment generation minister B Gopalakrishna Reddy for instigating the police to manhandle APCC secretary B Karunakar Reddy.

The Opposition leader was reacting to the police action against the all-party leaders on Wednesday at Tirupati when they tried to submit a representation to Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu asking him to withdraw the GO 781.

22,AIADMK-DMK clash in Rajya Sabha,"NEW DELHI: Even the empty Rajya Sabha benches did not deter the traditional Dravidian rivals from clashing over Tamil Nadu politics on Thursday.

While discussing a money bill of the Union government, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam member N Jyothi referred to the amount that was being spent on financial institutions that would go for subsidising bad debts. He said a Union cabinet minister owed around Rs 30 to a public sector bank and the minister has not repayed the amount yet.

When other members asked him to name the minister, Jyothi said he could but then he did not want to be accused of raking up Tamil Nadu politics in the house.

There was uncharacteristic silence from the DMK members. But when his turn came to speak on the bill, the DMK leader Viduthalai Virumb while winding up his speech said that the government should probe an investment made in the Cayman islands to the tune of Rs 600 crores by an Indian, and also about the FERA violations worth Rs 30 crore by a member of Parliament and the courts'' directions to recover Rs 28 crore from a chief minister.

Jyothi and his AIADMK colleagues almost rushed to the well shouting that a DMK minister owed money to the Indian bank. The scene turned ugly with Jyothi and Virumbi shouting at each other from the front benche. The BJP member SS Ahluwalia tried to pacify and separate them.

Meanwhile, Virumbi ran to the back benches and grabbed the hand of a fellow DMK MP and claimed that he has only four fingers because he was violently attacked by the AIADMK. This prompted shouts of `murderer'' at the DMK by the AIADMK. Finallay Ahluwalia was successful separating the fighting regional party members.

The elusive Maharaj, whose real name is Santosh Naik (29), was arrested in Mulund assistant inspector Ravindranath Angre August 17. He has been accused of controlling the activities of the dreaded Suresh Manchekar gang from his hideout in Parel.

It was Maharaj through whom the police were able to track down Manchekar and kill the don in an encounter in Kolhapur on August 15, officials said. Maharaj was the only person who knew Manchekar''s whereabouts, these officials added.

More than Manchekar''s killing, it was Maharaj''s arrest that put the brakes on the gang''s activities. ""Maharaj was the key controller of the gang,"" said a senior officer. While Manchekar preferred to remain at hideouts like Goa, Belgaum and Indore, Maharaj was in charge of recruiting shooters in Mumbai, collecting information on extortion victims, issuing threats using various mobile SIM cards, sending boys for collecting money and making final settlements on extortion sums with victims.""

The police feared that after Manchekar''s killing, Maharaj could have reorganised the gang and restarted his extortion activities in the Mumbai region. ""But with his arrest, the gang is as good as finished,""Mr Angre said. Arresting Maharaj was not easy. A few months ago, he had threatened a builder and asked him to cough up a few lakh rupees.

The money was to be paid in Thane, where the policemen laid a trap. They were surprised to see a woman collect the cash from the victim. They followed the car in which the woman made off. They followed her up to Parel, where the car stopped in front of a building. The woman got down and headed towards a flat, where she delivered the money.

She then left in the car. The next day, a posse of policemen, disguised as telephone wiremen, came to check the MTNL connection in the building. They went to the flat where the money had been delivered the previous day. The occupant was a young woman who allowed them to check her telephone. The police obtained the number and monitored all outgoing and incoming calls.

During the phone tapping, the police learnt that the woman was in constant touch with her husband,whom the police suspected to be Maharaj. During one conversation, the police came across certain telephone numbers through which they were able to trace Manchekar''s whereabouts, officials said.

A trap was laid on the highway near the ST stand in Kolhapur and Manchekar was killed as he alighted from a Tata Sumo. Two days later, the police monitored calls at the Parel apartment and learnt that Maharaj would be coming to Thane via the check naka on LBS Marg in Mulund. Mr Angre laid a trap and arrested him.He confessed to being Manchekar''s lieutenant.

24,DF ministers irked at being left out of meeting,"MUMBAI: Tension is building between chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde and several ministers and ruling party MLAs from Mumbai who complained that the CM ignored them when fine-tuning the agenda for Thursday''s crucial meeting with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in Parliament House.

""We represent the city and we ought to have been consulted for any plans on revival or improving on the existing infrastructure,"" said a minister in the Democratic Front (DF) government. ""But we have been kept at a safe distance and the entire presentation was made by officials without any inputs from us.""

DF ministers from the city were not included in the all-party state delegation led by Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi. The delegation included Mr Shinde, deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, former chief minister Narayan Rane, BJP leader Gopinath Munde and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar.

Ruling party MLAs were equally peeved with the CM for ""failing to build consensus with partymen"" and for his ""style of taking decisions unilaterally"". ""Politically also it will come as a setback for the Congress and the NCP MLAs from Mumbai,"" one MLA warned.

""With Mr Joshi leading the delegation, the Shiv Sena-BJP is bound to make it a political statement about their concern for Mumbai."" He said they were not given any information about the projects presented before the PM and the kind of funds that were to be asked for.""

MMRDA joint commissioner T. Chandrashekhar prepared the blueprint for the meeting, which was finalised after a power-point presentation with the chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar. But the ministers and the local DF MLAs representing Mumbai were not invited for the presentation. The ministers are peeved that even the guardian ministers for Mumbai and suburban Mumbai were not invited for the meeting.

Though Mr Bhujbal was present at the meeting with the PM, it was not as a guardian minister for Mumbai city but as a deputy chief minister. Kripashanker Singh, who is the guardian minister for suburban Mumbai, was not invited for the meeting as also for any briefings on the plan, a ruling party MLA said.

He said that though the PM was informed about a scheme for slum rehabilitation in Dharavi, the local MLA was not in the know about the contents of the scheme.
