1,"CM incompetent to rule, says Renuka","HYDERABAD: Khammam MP Renuka Chowdhury on Wednesday took a swipe at chief minister Chandrababu Naidu for â€œencouraging violenceâ€� against farmers.

Referring to the spate of incidents relating to alleged police excesses on farmers in the state, the Congress leader said that Naidu was â€˜incompetentâ€™ to rule the state.

â€œThe government instead of taking care of the farmersâ€™ needs is trying to complicate things. It takes every opportunity to blame the Centre for any shortcomings on the part of the state and it is unfortunate that the chief minister has very little or poor understanding of the farmer and his needs,â€� she said. The Congress leader said that Naidu heads a government that fails to supply adequate kharif seed, fertiliser, power and also check sale of spurious seed and fertiliser.

An action plan would be chalked out in consultation with the PCC and the CLP against the governmentâ€™s apathy towards farmers, she said and added that the government was yet to release its share of crop insurance to the affected farmers.

2,Hazare’s PIL: HC gives govt three weeks time,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday granted the state government three weeks time to file its affidavit in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare seeking action against senior police officers, including Mumbai police chief R.S. Sharma, indicted for dereliction of duty in the investigation of the Rs 2,000-crore fake stamp paper scam.

The advocate-general also said that the then state director-general of police O.P. Baliâ€™s report would also be shown as well as the stateâ€™s action taken report (ATR).

He said he would give details of action taken by the state against police officers indicted by Mr Jaiswal and clarify why no action was taken if such was the case.

3,Sena MLAs get inputs on polls at conclave,"MUMBAI: Top Shiv Sena leaders on Wednesday put the party MLAs through the paces in preparation of early assembly elections in Maharashtra.

A two-day conclave of Sena MLAs and senior functionaries, which was inaugurated by leader of the opposition Narayan Rane, is a clear indication that the Sena is all set to gear up with election machinery. The conclave is being held at Keshav Srushti, a Sangh complex, near Uttan in Bhayander.

â€œWe want to double our present strength of MLAs. If each MLA adopts a neighbouring constituency where the Sena had to suffer a defeat in the 1999 assembly elections, the party will be close to its goal,â€™â€™ Mr Rane told media persons.

The Sena leadership is also exploring the possibility of launching a stir against the Democratic Front government on a host of issues, including price rise, water scarcity, the deteriorating law and order situation and the multi-crore stamp duty scam.

4,Engg colleges told not to flout admission rules,"MUMBAI: The Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) has threatened to take action against minority-run engineering colleges that have decided not to follow the centralised admission procedure.

The DTE on Wednesday informed Bandraâ€™s Thadomal Shahani Engineering College and Worliâ€™s Watumull Institute of Electronic Engineering and Computer Technology that they will be penalised if they flouted government norms.

Both these colleges, which are run by the Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board, had announced that they would not admit students on the basis of the state merit list. Instead, they opted to conduct independent admissions for their Bachelor of Engineering courses.

The colleges contended that the state governmentâ€™s insistence on centralised admissions violated the autonomy granted to them by a supreme court order in 2002 that permitted private colleges to conduct their own admissions.

Thadomal Shahaniâ€™s principal, Krishna Kumar, refused to comment. â€œThe decision to conduct independent admissions was taken by the boardâ€™â€™ that governs both the institutions, he said. The board, on the other hand, has decided to adopt a wait-andwatch policy. â€œWe are still to receive the DTE letter,â€™â€™ said board secretary J.K. Bhambhani.

â€œOnce we get it, then we will apply our mind to it.â€™â€™ Both the colleges have not yet begun admitting students. Despite the supreme court order, the state government decided to hold centralised admissions to spare students the hassle of running from college to college and filling out forms.

Educationists said the issue hinged on the interpretation of the court order. â€œIf the DTE takes action against colleges conducting their own admissions, colleges could drag the matter to court,â€™â€™ the principal of a private college said.

At this rate, engineering admissions seem to be heading the same way as medical admissions. A bunch of medical colleges has challenged the stateâ€™s plan to conduct a common entrance test for medical admissions.

A Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court recently ruled in an interim order that colleges were not bound to follow the common entrance test. The matter is being heard by the Bombay high court.

5,MUDA to make changes in development plan,"MANGALORE: The Mangalore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) is contemplating on bringing about wide-ranging changes in its comprehensive development plan for Mangalore.

In this direction, the MUDA had organised a seminar on revision of comprehensive development plan-2002 here on Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters at the end of the seminar, Tejomaya, chairman of MUDA, said experts had deliberated on various issues like bye-laws and other issues, which, he said, needed changes in the present context.

He said all suggestions would be incorporated and sent to the Town and Country Planning Authority for approval. He sought inputs from the public which would be included in the plan. Suggestions, if any, could be sent to the MUDA office within a fortnight.

V.M. Hegde, director, Town Planning, who was also present, said the changes were necessitated as the plan for Mangalore had many lacuna, which would be plugged.

The MUDA is also planning to give relaxation in some areas like Floor Area Ratio (FAR), if the property owner gave space for widening the roads.

Tejomaya also said rain water harvesting (RWH) could also be made a basic requirement while giving permission for construction of houses.

6,Pune rickshawmen flout tariff card rule,"PUNE: Like their counterparts in the suburbs, many autorickshaw drivers in the city have stopped carrying and displaying the mandatory tariff card.

For a few months after the tariffs were revised in November 2002, auto rickshaw drivers actually displayed cards on the rear side of the driverâ€™s seat. Not any more.

L.P. Khade, regional transport officer (RTO), Pune region, told TNN, â€œIt is mandatory for every autorickshaw driver to carry a tariff card. If he is found without a card, he is liable to be fined for Rs 100 by an RTO inspector or a police sub-inspector.â€� When asked about rickshaw drivers in the suburbs (Pimpri-Chinchwad areas) regularly flouting the pay-bymeter rule, Khade said, â€œThe issue is being examined.â€�

â€œThe problem is compounded by the fact, that the drivers in Pimpri-Chinchwad, offer a â€˜share-an-autoâ€™ service to their passengers. This is not legal and we are examining the issue,â€� he said.

According to Khade, it was not the RTOâ€™s responsibility to print the tariff card (see latest card printed below). â€œAfter the rate revision in November 2002,we published the tariff card in newspapers.The onus is on the autorickshaw drivers to procure them,â€� Khade said.

When contacted, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Anant Shinde, said that he would find out why the city autorickshaw drivers had stopped carrying tariff cards.

Baba Adhav, president, Rickshaw Panchayat, the largest autorickshaw union in the city, denied that members of his union were not displaying tariff cards. Some of them cannot display the cards because the copies have worn out, he said.

However, Inspector Prakash Deshmukh pointed out, â€œThe cards are now available in the market for Rs 2. Auto drivers, therefore, have no excuse for not carrying them.â€�

8,Govt working on new policy for grains' export,"NEW DELHI: The Government on Thursday said it has adopted a cautious approach over falling stocks of rice and is working on a new grains'' exports policy which will be announced by the end of this month.

The current policy for export of wheat and rice will be reviewed after July 15 and if need be, the ministry will approach the Cabinet for an alternate course of action, Food Minister Sharad Yadav said on Thursday.

The minister was addressing a meeting of senior FCI officials on Food Management System of the country.

After the meeting he said, ""We are cautious over falling rice stocks. They will not be allowed to go below 100 lakh tonnes, what am I there for? a new policy for grains export is being given finishing touches,""

Rice stocks have dipped 43 per cent in June to 132 lakh tonnes from 234 lakh tonnes in the same month last year. Under the current grain export norms, at no point of time should rice stocks be below 100 lakh tonnes.

Officials said within the next two weeks, monsoon trends will be clearer. The Ministry will also be in a better position to analyse the kharif rice sowing scenario based on which the future policy for exports can be chalked out.

Under the proposed new Grains Export and Import Policy, an idea has been mooted under which traders will directly purchase from the market for exports while their expenses will be reimbursed to the extent permissible under WTO regime.

A major chunk of the stocks lifted from Central Pool are for export purposes. In the 2002-03 fiscal, 69.35 lakh tonnes rice and 54.5 lakh tonnes wheat were lifted for exports.

9,"SC rejects TN govt plea on CMC, Vellore","NEW DELHI: The Tamil Nadu government suffered a jolt on Thursday when the Supreme Court rejected its plea that it should be allowed to fill 15 seats meant for non-minority students in the prestigious Christian Medical College (CMC) at Vellore.

Through an interim order, a vacation Bench of Justices R C Lahoti and Brijesh Kumar allowed CMC to fill up all the 60 seats for the MBBS course. Of these seats, 45 seats will be reserved for Christian students, seven for open merit, three for scheduled caste and scheduled tribes, four seats for economically disadvantaged students and one seat for a Central government nominee.

The CMC had moved the apex court against the Jayalalithaa government''s order which sought to interfere with the administration and the admission of students in the institution despite a court verdict in 2002.

CMC''s counsel P H Parekh said the state government had acted in violation of the ``rights of the minority institutions guaranteed under Article 30 of the Constitution''''.

Parekh explained that Thursday''s order entails that CMC would continue to make appointments on the basis of an all-India competitive test held by it in disregard to the state government''s order.
