0,Drama in Bankshall Court over MMIC arrest,"KOLKATA: There was high drama at Bankshall Court on Tuesday over the arrest of seven mayor-in-council members of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and their subsequent release.

The seven councillors â€” Anup Chatterjee, Mala Roy, Javed Khan, Swapan Samaddar, Shamsuzzaman Ansari, Moinul Haq Choudhury and Pradip Ghosh â€” were arrested earlier in the day by the city police for assaulting municipal commissioner Debasis Som on Monday.

The MMICs were charged under different sections of the CrPC, including 342 (wrongful confinement), 332 (disturbing discharge of official duty), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention), all bailable offences.

The next hearing has been scheduled for June 24.

The police had a tough time arresting the MMICs.

Samaddar led a procession to the court and then went to the Lalbazar police headquarters to turn himself in.

Roy turned down the offer of the police to be released on a personal release bond and preferred to be arrested. Trinamul Congress supporters also blocked the road, led by party leader Sanjay Bakshi.

Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee donned an advocateâ€™s dress and attended the court hearing but did not plead for the accused. Before the chief metropolitan magistrate could issue PR bonds to all seven arrested MMICs, senior Trinamul leaders staged a demonstration in front of the court, protesting the arrests.

The harassed CMM ordered the police to organise the hearing in the balcony in front of his room after the police and the administration failed to restrain Trinamul supporters from shouting slogans and creating pandemonium inside the court room.

The court proceedings were delayed by over two hours and cases of police remand had to be rescheduled.

Trinamul leaders Tapas Roy and Saugata Roy, as well as MMICs like Rajib Deb and Shovan Chatterjee, attended the proceedings. Officers-incharge of five police stations, who arrested the MMICs from their homes, were also present.

On Tuesday, the Trinamul camp seemed united in supporting the MMICs.

1,Security intensified for MCC bandh,"RANCHI: Normal life was largely unaffected during the 48-hour Jharkhand bandh, called by the banned Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), which began on Tuesday morning with the ultras attempting to disrupt train services at a couple of railway stations.

A group of extremists locked up the chamber of the station master of Rai railway station after driving him out of his room in the wee hours, police sources said. They left the place after forces from the nearest Khelari police station reached the spot and broke open the lock.

In another incident, the ultras barged into the station masterâ€™s office at Barlanga station, between Ranchi and Hazaribag. They destroyed some registers and documents and snapped telephone wires. Police has identified some railway stations as troubled spots and security has been tightened around them and added the state police was coordinating with the Railway Protection Force to ensure the safety and security of passengers and the railway property.

Most of the bus operators have cancelled long route services in the wake of the bandh call given by the MCC in protest against alleged police atrocities.

Official source in Jamshedpur said MCC ultras had torched a truck near Bundu in Ranchi district on National Highway 33 in the morning.

Fearing similar attack, most of the busses on the Ranchi-Jamshedpur route stayed off the road on Tuesday. The officials informed the bandh was near total in the MCC infested areas of Gua, Manoharpur,Goilkera, Sonua in the West Singhbhum district.

Most of the shops remained closed and vehicular traffic also remained off the road in the area.

However, no untoward incident was reported from any part of the district so far as elaborate security arrangements were in place and police patrolling was intensified in the vulnerable areas.

2,Suburb gets a shock with arrest of teenage robbers,"KOLKATA: Residents of Kadarhat in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, could not believe their eyes when police raided the area and picked up seven â€œinnocent-looking boysâ€� from their neighbourhood on charges of robbery and snatching.

Police said the seven had unleashed terror in Garia, Sonarpur, Regent Park and Bagha Jatin area, and committed a series of robberies. â€œWe have recovered a six-chamber pipegun, two bullets, two daggers from them,â€� additional SP (industrial) Rajesh Singh said.

All aged between 14 and 16, the boys were sent to the juvenile justice court at Salt Lake on Monday.

â€œThese boys, from under-privileged families in Garia, Sonarpur, Bagha Jatin and Regent Park, indulged in stray delinquent practices quite early in their life. But one of them, a sixteen-and-half year-old, brought them under one umbrella,â€� an investigator said.

They went to Kadarhat area and took a house on rent. They aroused minimal suspicion as they projected themselves as workers of a factory.

They used to sleep all through the day and leave home in the evening on the pretext of night duty, police said.

â€œThese boys were extremely good-natured and helpful to us. They even used to do odd jobs voluntarily,â€� Amiya Dafadar, a shocked neighbour, said.

â€œBut they used to avoid questions relating to their background,â€� he added.

Investigation into some recent robberies in Garia, Sonarpur, Regent Park area revealed that the miscreants were unusually young.

â€œBut the professional finesse of their work completely foxed us. We thought some matured brain was pulling the string and controlling some young boys. But after the raid, we were surprised to find that it was a gang run and controlled completely by teenagers,â€� a Sonarpur police station officer said.

3,A 'powerful' pinch for common man,"LUCKNOW: With a 20 paise per unit increase in the domestic power rates announced by the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC), due from the June 20, the city denizens are perturbed. While on one hand the residents have an ever-increasing list of complaints, ranging from low voltage to frequent power cuts, a further increase in the power tariff has certainly added to their woes.

Reacting to the new tariff, Shailendra Dubey, secretary general, All India Power Engineersâ€™ Federation, said that the increase in power rates was becoming commonplace and power consumers have already seen a 55-60 per cent increase during last couple of years. With the privatisation of the power sector, there was bound to be a further increase, he added. â€œConsidering that the common man is already heavily taxed, this increase is improper to say the least,â€� he opined.

Atul Tandon, a shopkeeper, highlighted the problem further: â€œThe household budget is bound to suffer. For a middle class family, which is hard-pressed to save even Rs 100 a month, this uncalled for increase is certainly a bad news. The ultimate sufferer will be the consumer as shopkeepers and businessmen will make profits by increasing costs.â€�

Sandra Brown, a teacher, said: â€œSince Iâ€™m a working woman, my budget is already tight. With an increase in the power rates, Iâ€™m bound to suffer. What, however, irritates me is while I have to pay the ever-increasing bill, I see people around who unabashedly steal power. Nevertheless, as a conscious citizen we all have to fulfil our civic duties.â€�

Usha Bansal, a housewife, reacts sharply too. â€œThe major share of power is consumed by those sections who in any case are stealing it and that is the primary cause of low revenue generation. Increasing the power tariff will hardly solve the problem as pilfering will in any case continueâ€�.

4,BPCC chief to discuss party polls with Sonia,"PATNA: The appointment of Ram Jatan Sinha as the new BPCC chief has been hailed by party leaders.

According to Congress sources, Sinha is expected back from Delhi on Friday. Sadaquat Ashram will organise a function to felicitate him. Sinha, said the party leaders, will also hold talks with AICC president Sonia Gandhi on the organisational polls scheduled to be held soon.

The change of guard is being widely viewed as â€˜a step towards the direction of snapping ties with the RJDâ€™ a demand which has been repeatedly made by majority of Congress leaders here. ""None of the Congress ministers inform the district chiefs about their arrival and visit to respective districts,"" said a senior Congress leader expressing hope that Sinha would be able to bring more interaction between the ministers and party workers.

The vice president of the state Congress, Padmasha Jha, has expressed hope that the upper caste votes, which had eluded the Congress in recent years, will return to the party fold under Sinha. She said the upper castes had been feeling neglected by the present RJD government and due to the alliance they remained out of the party fold. BPCC secretary Srikant Satyadarshi and former MLA Raj Rajendra Pratap Dev have also greeted this move and said he can revitalise the party.

Former MP Mahendra Mohan Mishra said Sinha represented both the young and as well as old Congressmen. ""His tenacity and determination will help the party to regain a foothold,"" said Mishra. Others who hailed Sinha''s appointment included Gopalganj district chief Shaukat Ali, AICC member Khalid Rashid Saba, president of the Congress teachers'' cell Ramayan Prasad Yadav and former minister Shakeeluzzama.

6,"Rains cheer up weary officials, ministers","HYDERABAD: The long wait for the rains came to an end on Tuesday. It also managed to divert the attention of officials and ministers alike.

The drizzle began as collectors were debating water conservation methods, Neeru-Meeru and the need to increase the green cover in the state.

But soon it turned into a heavy downpour. And when the temptation to watch the rains became too strong to resist, ministers and officials were seen leaving the conference hall to have peek at it. Sometime later a drenched law minister P Chandrasekhar was seen coming to the meeting. The downpour lasted for nearly an hour.

The drizzle started in the premises of Jubilee Hall when the meeting was about to begin after the lunch break. The chief minister was speaking on the need to conserve water, revenue (secretary) and relief commissioner D Rosaiah came rushing in to inform Naidu about the rains. On seeing Rosaiahâ€™s excitement, a visibly happy Naidu quipped: â€œOur Rosaiah is pleased about rains.â€� In another development, officials have said that thundershowers are likely in parts of Hyderabad during the next 48 hours.

7,Curbs on farm land deals for 10 years,"BANGALORE: In a bid to check large-scale exploitation of farmers in the Command Area Development Authority (CADA) land, the Karnataka government on Tuesday restricted sale, lease, mortgage, exchange, transfer or alienating of these areas for 10 years.

Announcing this at a news conference here, water resources minister H.K. Patil said the Karnataka Irrigation (Amendment) Ordinance 2003 was necessitated owing to exploitation of farmers in the Krishna basin, where fertile and irrigation land was purchased by landlords for a pittance. The ordinance was issued on June 6.

Patil explained the situation had reached an extent where marginal farmers who sold their land, were reduced to agricultural labourers.

â€œFarmers are the target audience of our irrigation projects. If they sell land for a small amount, our objective is defeated. We invest Rs 17,000 to irrigate one acre while the same land is sold to landlords from Karnataka as well as other states for a meagre Rs 5,000 per acre,â€™â€™ Patil maintained.

Citing an example, he said 16,858 hectares of land in Shahpur in Gulbarga district in CADA of Upper Krishna Project (UKP) had already been sold by farmers to landlords.

â€œMore than 80 per cent of this land has been purchased by non-Karnataka residents. This is an alarming trend.â€™â€™

About 6.22 lakh hectares would be brought under irrigation in UKP. â€œAs of now, 4.50 lakh hectares have been brought under irrigation. The remaining areas will be covered in the next 15 months. We want farmers to enjoy the benefits of the irrigation project,â€™â€™ he added.

The notification was issued as recommended by a committee, headed by Dharwad University of Agricultural Sciences Vice-Chancellor S.C. Patil, to study the matter. â€œThe panel, which submitted its interim report, suggested imposition of restrictions on sale of irrigation land,â€™â€™ he said.

Relaxation: However, there is a relaxation on the ordinance. Farmers can sell land with prior permission from the designated â€˜irrigation officerâ€™.

Patil maintained the clause could not be misused as a senior officer would be appointed â€˜irrigation officerâ€™. â€œIf a farmer intends to sell his land, an application has to be submitted to the officer. It will be thoroughly scrutinised before taking any decision.â€™â€™

8,BJP threatens stir against coalition govt in J&K,"SRINAGAR: The Bharatiya Janata Party has threatened to launch an agitation against the PDP-led coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir against its policy of ""healing touch"".

Talking to the reporters here, state BJP chief Nirmal Singh accused the government of misleading the people by its healing touch policy and said: ""The PDP-Congress combine is misleading the people of the state. They are politicising the jobs given to the victims of militancy. In fact those people are being offered jobs who have links with PDP or Congress. What sort of healing touch is it?""

Lambasting the PDP and its alliance partners, he said, there was an inherent contradiction within the alliance partners.

""All the alliance partners fought elections on different planks. Congress and Panthers Party relied on regional feelings while the PDP raised the issue of human rights violations,"" said the BJP state unit president.

Singh said that the BJP welcomed the Prime Minister''s peace initiative and felt that it has gone well with the Kashmiri people here. He hoped that the initiative would usher in new era of peace and tranquility in the state.

14,"Gujarat BJP minister, MLAs named in fraud","VADODARA: Minister of state for cow protection and pilgrim centres development Prabhatsinh Chauhan and two sitting BJP MLAs among others, have been accused of misappropriating Rs 128 crore from the Godhra-based Panchmahals District Co-operative Bank (PDCB) in a police complaint filed on Wednesday.

Chauhan was the vicechairman of the bank before it was superceded recently.

The sitting BJP MLAs, who have been named in the complaint are Mahesh Bhuria of Limdi and Bhura Katara of Jhalod, were directors of the bank. The PDCB case is a sequel to a string of cases registered against BJP leaders in Gujarat for bank frauds.

PDCBâ€™s new managing committee has filed the complaint at the Fatehpura police station of Dahod district. The committee had superceded the board of directors after the bank withdrew from the RBIâ€™s clearing house citing â€œliquidityâ€� crisis as reason.

Police officials at Fatehpura said altogether 29 people have been accused of giving loans to farmers in the region on basis of fake documents.

There is a slew of former MPs and MLAs who have been named in the complaint including BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Godhra and former chairman of the bank Gopalsinh Solanki, former Congress Santrampur MLA Mansinh Bhamat, former Congress MLA from Jhalod Ditabhai Machar, former Congress from Godhra Rajendra Patel and former Congress MLA from Limdi Bachubhai Kishori.

Among others who make up the list are the district registrar of co-operatives for Panchmahals, present and former managers of some of the branches of PDCB, and officials of some of the village credit societies.

The crisis has been so severe that PDCB was forced to even withdraw their deposits with the Gujarat State Co-operative Bank, which is essential for maintaining the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR).

The bank had a deposit base of only Rs 192 crore, but made advances worth Rs 372 crore.

â€œWe filed the complaint at the Fatehpura police station as most of the misappropriated funds have been lent to credit societies in its jurisdiction,â€� said PDCBâ€™s managing director H J Mehta.

According to police officials, the accused allegedly first misappropriated Rs 87 crore and then another Rs 41 crore from the bank between 2001 and 2003. The two main beneficiaries who received the money were the Sukhpar Co-operative Credit Society and Nani Bhugedi Co-operative Credit Society, both of which are in the Fatehpura region. Bhuria is chairman of the Sukhpar society while Katara was chairman of the Bhugedi society.

Speaking to TNN, Gopalsinh Solanki insisted that the complaint was politically motivated. â€œFactions from within the BJP may be behind the complaint,â€� he said. â€œSome of the employees of the bank and credit societies have indulged in malpractice and I have even issued show-cause notices to them. For this, you canâ€™t hold the directors responsible.â€�

Solanki holds nearly 400 credit societies affiliated to the bank responsible for the liquidity crisis.

Prabhatsinh, on being contacted, said despite being vice chairman, he never attended meetings of the board. â€œAsk Gopalsinh Solanki about all this, he was running the show,â€� he remarked.

15,SFI approaches HC for reviewing college politics' judgment,"KOCHI: The Students Federation of India, the CPI-M''s student body, on Wednesday approached the Kerala High Court, seeking review of its earlier judgment holding that educational institutions in the state had the right to prohibit political activities in college campuses and restrict students from organising or attending political meetings within the college premises.

This is the third petition being filed seeking review of the May 26 judgment. The CPI''s students wing-- All India Students Federation (AISF) had approached the court earlier.

The petitioner, SFI state president, P K Biju, contended that observations and declarations of far reaching consequences and ramifictions have been made by the court without hearing the student community. None of the students organisations have been made party to the writ appeal on which the judgment was delivered.

Political activism and politics have not been defined anywhere in the judgment. Equating students rights with that of a government servant were ""totally misconceived,"" the petitioner contended.
