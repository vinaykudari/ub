0,Clock ticks for garbage trucks,"MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sought one-year extension from the Bombay high court to systematically phase out its fleet of compactors or garbage trucks.

The BMC compactorsâ€” most of which are 12 to 13 yearsâ€™ old â€” would not be able to ply on the city roads once the high court deadline for eight-year-old heavy vehicles expires on January 5.

While dispensing a case on vehicular pollution in Mumbai, the high court had directed that all eight-year-old heavy vehicles have to be either phased out or converted to clean fuels like compressed natural gas (CNG) by January 1, 2004.

The apex court has extended the deadline to January 5. The high court has allowed the BMC to operate their garbage trucks on city roads till January 15.

1,Amarinder govt will fall: Badal,"FATEHGARH SAHIB: As expected, Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) reiterated its call for an anti-repression morcha against the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government at its political conference on Thursday. But, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) went in for a two-pronged attack: identifying SAD (B) as its main target and the Congress party as the main enemy of Sikhs.

Significantly, Sukhbir Badal was presented as the third main leader of the party and the ""Young leader of Akalis"" by none other than former finance minister Kanwaljit Singh,who once had crossed swords with him.

Predicting that the Amarinder Singh government would fall due to internal crises, Badal said the chief minister had no moral right to continue when 16 of his cabinet colleagues were opposing him. He appealed to the people to reject the Congress in the next Lok Sabha elections.

Pursuing the partyâ€™s oft-repeated line, Badal said the Congress was responsible for Operation Bluestar and anti-Sikh riots in 1984 and no true Sikh should vote for the party.

Badal praised Atal Bihari Vajpayee saying that he was the only prime minister who had extended all-out help for the development of Punjab and even extended an amount of Rs 100 crore for tercentenary celebrations of the birth of Khalsa.

He asked the Akali workers to prepare themselves for Lok Sabha and SGPC elections. SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra asked the people to strengthen Badalâ€™s position and defeat the Congress party. Paying tributes to the Sahibzadas, he expressed his happiness for getting an opportunity to speak from the SAD (Badal) stage after four years.

Two former SGPC presidents Kirpal Singh Badungar, Bibi Jagir Kaur and senior leader Balwinder Singh Bhundar were among the speakers. No senior BJP leader were present due to the birthday celebrations of the prime minister.

The political conferences organised by different political parties were an opportunity to show their strength. But the SAD (B) show attracted large numbers. Perhaps betraying its soft corner for chief minister Amarinder Singh, SAD (Amritsar) cautioned Parkash Singh Badal against joining hands with Congress leader Rajinder Kaur Bhattal to form a government in Punjab. The reason: ""Bhattal was equally responsible for the genocide of Sikhs during Beant Singh government as she was a minister in his cabinet"".

Slamming the Akal Takht jathedar for giving siropas to Badals, who were facing trial under charges of corruption and had brought a bad name to Sikhs, he said that even great Sikhs like Hari Singh Nalwa and Sham Singh Atari were never honoured by the Akal Takht.

The party announced that it would contest all seats in the SGPC elections and criticized the Union Government for not conducting these elections though these have been due since 2001. In a resolution, the SAD (Amritsar) said that the Supreme Court had no right to settle water disputes according to the Riparian International Law, and if the decision of the court went against the interests of Punjab, the Sikhs would not approve it and would resort to revolt.

The Dal Khalsa, Akali Dal (Ravi Inder) and Lok Bhalai Morcha also organised their political conferences in the Mela.

2,"LS polls: BJP, Cong make conflicting claims","CHANDIGARH: There seems to be no end to the hectic political activity going on in the city which began with the announcement of panchayat elections in the beginning of this month.

After the panchayat elections, it was the election for the post of mayor. Now political parties have shifted focus to the ensuing Lok Sabha elections and are gearing up for the â€˜big fight'' scheduled next year.

Rival political parties, BJP and Congress have already started making claims and counter-claims about their support and strength. Both the two parties are claiming that a maximum number of elected sarpanches are aligned with their party.

Yashpal Mahajan, president of local unit of BJP, claims that nine elected sarpanches and 88 panches in 17 gram panchayats are affiliated to BJP. Congress is also taking credit of its high presence among the elected sarpanches and panches as party leaders maintain that 13 sarpanches and over 100 panches are aligned with their party.

Senior functionaries of both the parties say that good presence in villages will definitely help them in making their position strong in Lok Sabha elections.

In mayor elections, Congress party had four eligible candidates for the post which is reserved for scheduled caste person this time. But BJP played its role by instigating one of the councillors to contest as an Independent.

The Congress move to field Kamlesh as mayor candidate is being seen as a â€˜political gimmick'' to attract BSP voters, who belong to her caste, for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Political observers say that Congress has tried to balance the vote-bank of â€˜Valmikis'' by proposing Geeta Rani''s name for deputy mayor for the second term.

On the other side, BJP is ready to take benefit from the Congress''s decision. Senior leaders of BJP say that the â€˜Valmiki'' community is unhappy with Congress for not choosing the mayor candidate out of three â€˜Valmiki'' candidates.

BJP leaders are also claiming that the party has not fielded anyone against Geeta Rani, who has filed nominations for deputy mayor, because their party wants that â€˜Valimikis'' should get their share.

In another significant move, BJP and SAD alliance in the corporation has again revived. A SAD leader has announced that councillor Harjinder Kaur is a member of the SAD and Rajesh Gupta''s name for the post of senior deputy mayor has been proposed through BJP-SAD alliance.

Meanwhile, the infighting in the local unit of the BJP also seems to have got a relief with Gyan Chand Gupta being appointed as cashier of Haryana BJP. The dissident group in the party is likely to mellow down with Gupta shifting base of politics from the city.

4,Laugh riot all the way,"BANGALORE: Albert Einstein was trying to enter heaven. He was asked by the guard to prove his identity. Einstein wrote out equations. Then came Picasso, who drew a painting. Then George Bush landed up. â€œI am Bush,â€™â€™ he told the guard.

The guard said insistently: â€œ Even Einstien and Picasso were asked prove their identity, so prove yours.â€™â€™

â€œEinstein? Picasso? Who are they?â€™â€™ asked Bush. â€œOh, you must be Bush!â€™â€™ the guard exclaimed.

â€¢ It was a contest on who could tell the biggest lie. The one that stole the cake was: â€œMy father lay down on the railway track. His head was severed. His guru frantically ran around and found a cow, whose head he cut off and instead attached my fatherâ€™s to it. My father is fine and daily gives two litres of milk.â€™â€™

â€¢ Two neighbourhood samosa shops were doing business. One put a board claiming: â€œWe supply samosas to the the queen.â€™â€™ The other one countered: â€œGod save the queenâ€™â€™ It was a day of jokes and laughter for nearly 4,000 odd people on Thursday at â€˜Hasyothsava 2K3â€™, an annual event for laughter at H.N. Kalakshetra, National College, Jayanagar.

Amidst them was chief minister S.M.Krishna, who set aside his official engagements for nearly an hour and spent time amidst laughter, along with his wife Prema.

The event started off on a sombre note, for film director G.V. Iyer â€” who died on Sunday â€” was supposed to inaugurate it. But litterateur Srinivasa Vaidya did the honours and had the audience rollicking with self-deprecating jokes. â€œSome people in Dharwad gave me an award. So colleagues said â€” well, they must have given it only because of your advanced age.

Others said: whose feet did you fall at to get it? Teach us also. And some others said â€” at least now that you have got the award, we hope you will write well..â€™â€™ This yearâ€™s Hasyothsava was organised in memory of editors Y.N. Krishnamurthy and T.S. Ramachandra. Comedians like Mimicry Dayananda, R.K. Padmanabhan, A.Ra. Mitra, educationist H. Narasimhaiah and Richard Louis participated.

5,Ojha to address rally on Friday,"BEGUSARAI: The decision of Bihar''s former director general of police D P Ojha to address his first public rally at Bihat on December 26, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of late Chandrashekhar Prasad Singh, a veteran CPI leader, has given rise to speculation in the political circles here.

Speculation is rife that the former DGP may join the CPI in his pursuit to expose the much talked about criminal-politician-police nexus in the state. Singh had been one of the founding pillars of the communist party in the post-independent era. Most of the people feel that Bihat has traditionally been the stronghold of the communists here and to start his crusade against the nexus from this very place lent strength to these speculations.

Moreover, people here remember the speech delivered by the former DGP last time here at a police-public meeting as the state DGP then. At that time, he had talked about his special bond shared with the leftists stream of thought and had also said that the thoughts and actions of the veteran communist leader had left an indelible mark on his life. He had attributed his ingrained associations with a left based student outfit during his student days.

Commenting on the rising speculations, district BJP chief Shankar Singh said that though it had been learnt that there would not be the customary CPI flags and festoons on the occasion, but the fact remained that it had traditionally been a CPI affair. Claiming the support lent to the former DGP in his bid to expose the criminal-politician-police nexus as issue based, he further said that the activists of BJP would not be a part of the occasion.

However, when this reporter talked to former CPI MP and a prominent leader of the party, Shatrughan Prasad Singh, on this issue he termed these speculations as ""premature'''' and said that the present decision could only be attributed to Ojha''s wish made in this regard before some party leaders during his last visit here as the state DGP. He, however, also left the doors for these speculations open by saying that ""let them keep undeciphered till Friday''''. Samata leader Chitaranjan Prasad Singh said that on the basis of the talks held by him with the former DGP in this regard, he could say that the occasion would not be a single-party affair.

Singh said that in response to the apprehensions expressed by him to the former DGP, he said that he was coming here on an invitation extended to him by the CPI MLA from Matihani, Rajendra Rajan. He added that the former DGP said that going by the stature of the veteran communist leader, the occasion should not confined to one party, particularly in view of the contributions made by the veteran leader of building a corruption-free society in the state.

6,"Woman officer, three others commit suicide","NEW DELHI/GHAZIABAD: Four suicides were reported in the city and Ghaziabad. A 30-year-old woman committed suicide by hanging herself at her Vasant Vihar home on Thursday morning.

The police said, Alka Jha was unmarried and worked as an immigration officer at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. She was on deputation from the Intelligence Bureau.

â€˜â€˜In her suicide note, she has claimed that she was fed up and therefore wanted to end her life,â€™â€™ said a police officer.

Alka parents had come down from Bokharo to stay with their daughter who had taken a CPWD flat on rent. â€˜â€˜On Thursday morning, her mother entered Alkaâ€™s room and found her hanging with a dupatta from a window grill,â€™â€™ the officer added.

In Ghaziabad, a married man and his sister-in-law committed suicide by consuming poison on Wednesday night. The police said the two, Jitendra and Kavita, wanted to marry but their families opposed the decision.

Jitendra, a transporter, was married to Babita for five years. ago. â€˜â€˜About six months back, Babita called her sister to nurse her during her second pregnancy,â€™â€™ said area police circle officer Dinesh Yadav. Kavita and Jitendra, apparently developed an intimate relationship and decided to get married, he added.

The decision was strongly opposed by their families. The two consumed aluminium phosphide, an agricultural fumigant, at about 9 pm. They were rushed to the hospital by their relatives but died there.

In another incident, an Indian Air Force Lance Naik committed suicide by hanging himself in his home at the Hindon Air Force base. Lance Naik R P Singh did not leave behind any suicide note.

7,Poor sales tax collections put govt in quandary,"NEW DELHI: A review of revenue collection by the Delhi finance minister Dr A K Walia on Wednesday revealed that it is falling short of the target by nearly Rs 700 crore. With the budget only three months away, this spells bad news for the government.

The government, say revenue experts, will be reluctant to impose any new taxes with 2004 being the election year for the Lok Sabha. Balancing the books before the March 2004 budget session would indeed be a tedious task, they claim.

The total receipts of the government are about Rs 7,000 crore, out of which sales tax contributes about Rs 4,000 crore.

The problem, claim officals in the finance department, lies in the sales tax collection in Delhi, which has been slacking this year. The total sales tax collection till November 30, 2003 stood at only Rs 290 crore. Officials point out that even a concerted drive to step up collections in the last three months cannot make it cross Rs 4150 crore, a good Rs 250 crore behind the Rs 4,400 crore-target last budget.

Excise collection, however, have been closer to the mark, with the department having already collected Rs 680 crore out of a projected target of Rs 850 crore set for the fiscal. â€˜â€˜But, excise contributes only 20 per cent or even less to the total revenue. Itâ€™s the sales tax which is worrying,â€™â€™ said an official.

Several reasons have been cited for causing poor sales tax collection, including extremely cumbersome procedures evolved for filing the tax. â€˜â€˜The summary assessment scheme for those whose sales tax collection is under Rs 2 crore has failed spectacularly with only 2 per cent of traders coming forward,â€™â€™ said an official.

Finance minister Dr A K Walia, however, sounded optimistic: â€˜â€˜The government does not follow a corporate business model. This is certainly not something that will trigger a crisis.â€™â€™ There are still three months left before the financial year ends, he added.

8,Tech varsity VC quits over tiff with minister,"KOLKATA: Just when the West Bengal University of Technology was trying to discipline the 67-odd professional colleges under it, its vice-chancellor and renowned scientist Bikash Sinha chose to quit, apparently over differences with higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakrabarty.

Sinha put in his papers to chancellor Viren J Shah earlier this week. Hardly a year ago, the governor had insisted that Sinha accept the assignment. Now, the state to save itself from embarrassment, has found Asoke Thakur for the pro-vice chancellorâ€™s post.

Thakur, who was the pro-vicechancellor of Jadavpur University till Monday was asked to quit his office and join the technology university on the same post.

Sinha had taken over as VC as an additional charge apart from his being the director of the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre. That explains why Sinha didnâ€™t take any benefits from the technology university.

When TNN contacted him at his residence, Sinha said, ""I had to leave office because of some procedural complication. I canâ€™t serve the Central government and a local government institution simultaneously.

I had brought it to the stateâ€™s notice and wanted the authorities to sort it out. But it didnâ€™t happen,"" said Sinha.

But the ""official reason"" does not sound too convincing. Sinhaâ€™s assignment with the Central government is not new. He was in charge of both these institutions when he was offered the VCâ€™s chair. In fact, Delhi had given a go ahead to Sinhaâ€™s taking over as vice-chancellor.

According to university sources, Sinha was not in the best of terms with higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakrabarty. He did not subscribe to the ""mushrooming of private engineering colleges and new courses of dubious academic standards."" There are allegations that during his tenure as vice-chancellor, Sinha was not always aware of the new colleges getting affiliation from the university.

He came to know of them only when the papers came to him for ratification.

9,Principals will pay for lack of amenities,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is preparing a list of â€˜â€˜100 worst schoolsâ€™â€™ in terms of cleanliness, and availability of water coolers, toilets and playgrounds.

The education department will hold the principals of the defaulting schools responsible for the state of the schools and penalise them.

To improve the basic sanitation services within the schools, the government is also considering to privatise maintenance of school toilets. Delhi education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely admitted that some schools lack even basic facilities like toilets and drinking water. Of the 965 schools running in about 650 buildings, 10 per cent do not even have proper electrification, while 19 schools still run from tinsheds.

Lovely said: â€˜â€˜We will soon review the schoolsâ€™ infrastructure and disbursement of funds done under Vidyalaya Kalyan Samiti. The principals found guilty of under-utilisation of funds will face strict action.â€™â€™ Senior officials said every school was provided with Rs 1.20 lakh last year. It has been found during inspections that some of the schools have not â€˜â€˜utilised the funds properly.â€™â€™

Lovely observed during his inspections that low-height urinals and washbasins for students of primary sections have not been provided. â€˜â€˜To begin with, the department must ensure that all girlsâ€™ schools have clean and hygienic toilets. Besides water coolers, the school administration must replace all broken windows to save students from the cold,â€™â€™ he said.

The department is also considering engaging agencies, other than the public works depart-ment (PWD), to carry out repairs and construction of school buildings. â€˜â€˜The PWD is too occupied with major projects and that delays the infrastrcture-related work,â€™â€™ he said.

In another development, the education department has given the go ahead to recruit staff for teaching Urdu and Punjabi in government schools.

â€˜â€˜Twenty teachers each for Urdu and Punjabi would start teaching in our schools from next academic year. The first batch is already undergoing training,â€™â€™ he said.

Since Urdu and Punjabi were recognised as second languages by the government, the concept to introduce it in school curriculum never to`ok off due to lack of well-versed teachers. The government has been hiring staff from private academies. â€˜â€˜Two schools in each of the nine zones would be identified where the scheme will be introduced,â€™â€™ Lovely said.

10,Anti-conversion laws yet to be framed,"GANDHINAGAR: The controversial Freedom of Religion Act, passed by the Gujarat assembly in March 2003, may still take some time for implementation.

Law and parliamentary affairs minister Ashok Bhatt told newspersons on Wednesday that rules under the Act, which had come under attack from the US State Department, have not yet been framed.

""The Act will come into force during the next assembly session after rules are finalised,"" he declared.

While launching his Siddhi yatra at Phagvel last week, Chief Minister Narendra Modi had named the Act as one of the main â€˜achievementsâ€™ of his governmentâ€™s one year in office.

The state assembly is likely to have budget session in February 2004. ""We are studying the anti-conversion laws of Tamil Nadu,Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. Once the process is over, rules will be put out.""

Asked why rules had not been finalised in nine months, Bhatt said, ""It is a complicated matter.We are consulting the advocategeneral."" Minister of state for home Amit Shah holds the view that no permission for conversion is needed in case of Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs as they come under the Hindu personal law. However, any conversion to Islam or Christianity would need permission as these religions follow separate personal laws.
