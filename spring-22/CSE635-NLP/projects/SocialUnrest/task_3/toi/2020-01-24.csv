0,"For the minister, ignorance is bliss","LUCKNOW: Ignorance is bliss. At least for the minister for higher education Shyam Sundar Sharma, who isn''t even aware of the decisions already taken by his ministry. Or is it that his staff wants him to bask in publicity even when it is not due?

On Wednesday, the minister told a delegation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled tribes that the government will consider the reduction 50 per cent marks requirement for the SC\ST applicants for the post of lecturers at graduation level in universities and degree colleges, National Eligibility Test(NET) and State Lecturer Eligibility Test( SLET).

Sharma said that the directives of the UGC, which say that ""50 per cent requirement"" at graduation level is necessary for getting the job of a lecturer, might be removed for the benefit of SC\ST candidates.

The minister also said that a number of vacancies existed but they were not being filled for want of suitable candidates.

When TNN tried to get more details about the provision an official just laughed at him and the way the minister had tried to fool the people.

""You want more details about this proposal?"" he asked mischievously and added that it was no longer in the realm of a proposal. A GO has already been issued allowing relaxation of 5 per cent marks, he said.

However, this relaxation was applicable only when the candidates fulfilled other requirements. The official said that the decision was taken to facilitate SC candidates secure jobs and it did help them.

1,SEC lauds people for panchayat polls,"PATNA: In its recently-published book â€œGrassroot Democracy Incarnateâ€�, the State Election Commission (SEC) has expressed gratitude to the common people in rural areas for the peaceful conduct of panchayat elections which were held in the state after 23 years.

Terming the common man in rural areas as the â€œlittle manâ€�, a phrase coined by Winston Churchill, the SEC said that they clearly and decisively sealed the destiny of the candidates for the three-tier panchayati raj institutions â€œby their silent but decisive battle through the ballotâ€�. The common man had the last laugh, it added.

The SEC was a nascent body before holding the panchayat elections. This being its first exercise to hold elections at the grass-roots level, it had to prepare afresh the BDOs to face and solve the complexity of the problem in holding elections at the grass-roots level.

â€œMoreover, there was a threat of large-scale violence and bloodshed during the elections as appearing in the media. But the so-called informed people were proved wrong. The illiterate and so-called uninformed voters of the rural areas had come out triumphant demolishing the assessment of the self-made opinion-makers about political awareness of the rural population,â€� it added.

The rural people had shown â€œcommendable alertness and alacrity with a discerning mind in election of mukhiyas of gram panchayats, the members of gram panchayats and panchayat samitis and the members of zila parishadâ€�, the SEC added.

The SEC found that the district civil administration and police administration had proved beyond doubt that the district machinery concerned with elections could deliver results â€œif there is clear and unambiguous direction from the topâ€�.

But the casual approach of the state government and very poor response to the SECâ€™s certain recommendations for taking administrative action against certain state officials disturbed the SEC which was trying to hold free and fair elections. The SEC had complained about some officers and recommended to the state government action against them â€œfor their having shown deliberate and partial attitude to settle their personal scores by rejecting nominations of certain candidates without any valid reason and against the specific instruction of the SECâ€�.

In such cases, the SEC had recommended immediate transfer of the erring officers. â€œIn some cases, the government had transferred the officers but after a long time gap, with the result that other delinquent officers could not learn any lesson. In such cases, prompt transfers would have acted as a deterrent for other officers with similar propensityâ€�.

â€œThis casual approach of the state government had forced the SEC to debar such officers from election duty,â€� the SEC says in the book.

This was possible because the elections were held on the basis of constitutional provision made in the 73rd amendment and the relevant changes made in the Bihar Gram Panchayati Raj Act.

2,"Energy minister, JSEB chairman involved in war of attrition","RANCHI: Even as the Jharkhand State Electricity Board member (technical), S N Akhouri has been charged with forgery under different sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act by the boardâ€™s vigilance in connection with tenders for construction of power sub-stations following which an FIR was lodged at the Hatia police station here on December 28, the matter has once again boiled down to a mere war of words and game of one-upmanship between the boards chairman, Rajib Ranjan and state power minister, Lalchand Mahto.

The minister has raised objections against the unceremonious handing over additional charges of member (technical) to the member (finance) of the board, C Merwar on Januray 9, after Akhouri went on unauthorised leave from December 30.

According to the minister, all appointing and transfer powers were vested with the ministry under the Bihar Electricity Supply Act and the JSEB do not have the authority in this regard.

On the other hand, Ranjan claimed that under the Section 11 of the said Act, the board had the power to reallocate jobs on the basis of performance of its members.

The JSEB in a letter to the secretary, ministry of power, on December 30 had sought directions on the matter while informing him that even though Akhouriâ€™s leave application was rejected, he had proceeded on leave and his whereabouts were not known to the Board during the period.

The letter also said that the member was implicated in a number of vigilance cases and feared that the member could tamper with evidences if he was allowed to continue on his post.

On Wednesday, while Akhouri reported for duty, he was not allowed to join by the Board even as the chairman has sought an explanation from him about his whereabouts during the period.

3,'Agri intelligence' a fillip to farmers,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh will be the second state in the country after Maharashtra, to have an ''agriculture marketing intelligence system''. The move, aimed at benefiting the farming community in the state, will link all the mandis across the state, letting farmers have access to information about the price of their produce.

Stating this at a workshop on ''Enterprise wide information system and supply chain management for organisational efficiency'', organised by the Progress Harmony Development (PHD) chamber of commerce and industry, principal secretary (agriculture industry and agriculture export promotion) Rai Singh, said the set-up would be of immense importance to the farmers, especially in the sphere of trading, as it would enable them to know the exact rates, quantum and other details of the food grains in the various mandis of the state.

He added that the consultancy would entail an expenditure of only Rs 4-5 lakh and talks on this have already reached an advanced stage.

Referring to another major decision taken by the government, Singh said the government has introduced the contract farming system through the mandi samitis. Farmers can now go in for contract farming, which would benefit both the producers as well as the industrialists.

Singh lamented that the country is importing fruits and vegetables worth Rs 930 crore and pointed out that if there was a better chain supply, this could be avoided. He added that the nation is also suffering a net loss of Rs 35,000 crore in agriculture, for the want of storage, processing and transportation facilities for agricultural produce.

The secretary said that the country had an export potential worth Rs 3,000 crore for sesame, but UP was only able to export sesame worth Rs 27 crore. Likewise, there was a great demand for white onions in the US and Germany, but this was not being exploited.

The supply chain management set-up could play an important role in improving agriculture efficiency, he stated.

Referring to the mobile cold storage brought from Chennai to UP, the principal secretary said it would help in redressing the grievances of those who wanted to export their goods.

It was in the interactive session, that Rai said the bureaucracy was the biggest hurdle in the development of the country, and an important reason why FDI was not coming to the country. Even for small things, a person has to run from pillar to post, he lamented.

He said that efforts are on to redress the grievances of entrepreneurs, exporters, etc. These grievances are mostly related to the power situation, labour issues, infrastructure facilities and the prevailing corruption, he pointed out.

6,"Mayawati to throw open government jobs for SC, ST","LUCKNOW: Aiming to implement her Dalit agenda in the state, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati is contemplating throwing open government jobs for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The government had earlier announced a freeze on government jobs and had even signed an agreement with the World Bank under ''Administrative Restructural Project'' to reduce its workforce annually by 2 per cent.

""Cocking a snook at the existing freeze and agreement with the World Bank, the government has decided to fill SC/ST vacancies,"" a senior IAS officer said, adding that initial indications suggest that the government would fill over 2,700 reserved vacancies.

The ball was set rolling earlier this week, with the chief minister asking Chief Secretary D S Bagga to convene a meeting of officials to assess existing backlog in vacancies under reserved quota, a highly placed source said.

In a terse message, Bagga asked principal secretaries and heads of different departments to furnish details of the backlog in SC/ST vacancies.

After some initial meetings, officers were asked to submit their reports by Thursday evening and the officers complied with the orders, a senior IAS officer said here on Friday.

Promises to grant jobs have always had a political overtone and to cash in on it erstwhile Chief Minister Rajnath Singh had announced over 40,000 jobs, under Group C clerical grade, but his decision was put on hold following a Supreme Court order.

Justifying Mayawati''s decision a senior IAS officer in chief minister''s secretariat said the government was not creating new jobs per se but had decided to fill the posts under reserved category which had either fallen vacant or were not filled earlier.

""The government is contemplating to start a campaign to fill reserved posts and if need be the World Bank would be taken into confidence before starting this campaign,"" he said.

In the political circles, Mayawati''s move is seen as an attempt to implement her Dalit agenda after her ambitious Ambedkar Village Development Project failed to make a political mark following lack of funds to carry out development projects in the state.

""As Ambedkar Gram Project hangs in a limbo, a promise to Dalits to give them government jobs could help Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati to sensitise her vote bank,"" said Dr S P Singh, a social scientist of Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Social Studies.
