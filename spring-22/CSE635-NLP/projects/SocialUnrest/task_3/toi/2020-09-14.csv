0,Successive govts have neglected Old City: Qureshi,"HYDERABAD: The reason why successive governments have not paid attention to the Old City and neglected its development is that its MLA happens to be from opposition parties and governments do not readily develop an area belonging to an opposition member.

â€œThe peopleâ€™s complaint of step-motherly treatment by the governments is not baseless,â€™â€™ says Mohammed Abdul Rahim Qureshi, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) secretary.

Qureshi, who is also the president of All India Majlis Tameer-e-Millat, holds the post of AIMPLB official spokesperson. He is credited with being an authority on the controversial Ram Janmabhoomi and Babri Masjid issue.

He says poor educational standards of most of the people is one of the main reasons for their backwardness. Further, some of the forced ceremonies and a growing tendency for huge spending on marriages have been pushing the people deep into trouble. Lack of civic sense among the people has led to their backwardness. But on the other hand, the governmentâ€™s inadequate efforts to develop their localities further added problems, Qureshi says.

The Old City heads the list of â€œmost dropped outâ€™â€™ zones when it comes to school education. The reason is that most of these children earn a living already. Also because most of their parents are peddlers, thelawalas, rickshaw pullers, autorickshaw drivers and casual labourers and they cannot meet educational expenses, Qureshi says with anguish.

One way to overcome their lack of education, he says, is for the government to implement Article 45 of the Constitution to ensure â€œfree and compulsoryâ€™â€™ education for all children below 14 years. â€œSet up KG to middle-level schools in large numbers in Urdu and English media and appoint teachers on contract basis, besides encouraging standard private schools to come up in these areas,â€™â€™ is Qureshiâ€™s prescription to the problem.

The government should stop the trend of shifting its offices from the Old City to other parts of Hyderabad and instead reverse the process. The government should demolish old structures of erstwhile police commissionerâ€™s office and municipal headquarters and use available spaces to construct massive multi-storied buildings to set up important offices, Qureshi suggests.

Youngsters should be involved in various socio-economic activities by providing them self-employment opportunities and giving them training in various fields so that the problems being created on account of unemployment are prevented.

Civic sense should be encouraged so that the people support the government in going ahead with its developmental projects. The government should draw a comprehensive development plan as it has done for Kukatpally and Pocharam areas.

However, Qureshi has words that also please the government. Expressing support to the plan of widening the roads, he says, â€œThe main roads in the Old City should be widened and narrow lanes must be expanded by taking some harsh decisions.â€™â€™

More public utility centres should be set up and community centres and playgrounds must be built, besides creating public parks and recreational facilities to provide a healthy atmosphere.

1,Situation worst in Bihar: Union power minister,"PATNA: ""The power situation in Bihar is the worst in the country and it is a matter of great concern for everyone,"" Union power minister Anant G Geete said on Sunday and added that he was not saying this out of any political prejudice. ""We cannot ignore the truth,"" he said.

Geete was in the city on way to Barh to inaugurate the site office of Barh Super Thermal Power Project of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and lay the stone for a training centre.

In an interview with The Times of India, the Union minister said there is an urgent need for power reforms in Bihar for which the Centre is ready to provide all kinds of assistance.

Geete said the generation, distribution and transmission networks in the state are in a very bad shape. ""Yeh chinta ka vishaya hai.""

He also expressed concern over the fact that Bihar owed a huge sum of energy bills to the NTPC. For final settlement of the dues, he said, the power ministry has evolved a mechanism to give some concessions to states.

The minister said the state government has agreed to commission the Powergrid Corporation of India for strengthening the transmission and distribution networks in north and south Bihar.

The Union energy secretary, R V Shahi, has already held a talk with the chief minister in this regard, he said.

Geete admitted that the much-publicised Barh super thermal power project has been delayed. But it will be completed by 2008, he said, adding earlier it was scheduled to be completed by 2007.

Talking about the Nabinagar (Aurangabad) power project of 1000 MW of railways and NTPC, he said it would be completed in time.

Expressing concern over the transmission and distribution (T&D) losses in the country, he said it is roughly around 30 to 40 per cent of the total generation. Of this, 22 per cent losses can be ascribed to the power theft.

The minister laughed when asked about the rank of Bihar in this regard.

He said the Centre is committed to electrifying all the villages by 2007 AD for which ""we have to generate an additional one lakh MW power"".

""We have fixed a target of generating 41,000 MW in the 10th five-year plan and the rest in the 11th plan,"" he said.

Asked about the Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited ownership issue, he said the matter is pending before the Union home ministry.

""It would be not appropriate to speak at this moment,"" he said.

2,Engineers sore at govt decision,"PATNA: While the state will celebrate the 143rd birth anniversary of renowned engineer and Bharat Ratna, Dr M Vishveshwaraiya, on Monday, the engineers are unhappy over the state government''s decision to hand over 75-acre land of one of the premier irrigation research institutes of the country, Bihar Institute of Hydraulic and Applied Research (BIHAR), for the proposed hospital to be constructed on the pattern of AIIMS in the state capital.

Engineers welcome the decision of the Centre to build an AIIMS-type hospital in Patna, but are hurt by the move of the state government for playing with the pride of the state. Some other land could have been allotted for the hospital, said former president of Bihar Engineering Services Association Shyamnandan Prasad Singh. The land should not have been given at the cost of BIHAR, which had done pioneering research work in the past.

According to engineers, the importance of BIHAR could well be gauged from the fact that the Central Board of Irrigation and Power, a unit of Union government, had authorised BIHAR to design Gravel Pack for Tubewell Manuals. The tubewell irrigation parameters prepared by BIHAR later became mandatory for all the states.

This apart, BIHAR was the centre for model testing for studying the behavioural pattern of rivers including Koshi, Gandak and Sone, research and analysis on silt, and mixed analysis of concrete structures of dams and other structures. Besides, BIHAR also houses a metereological centre for its own purpose.

With the construction of the hospital, the glorious history of BIHAR, which was established in 1956, would come to an end.

4,Gujarat riot witness names councillor,"AHMEDABAD: A witness deposing before the Nanavati-Shah Commission, which is probing into the riots in Gujarat last year, said that an independent municipal councillor from Gomtipur, Iqbal Sheikh, was leading a mob which dragged and killed a Sales Tax officer.

Mahesh Parmar, a resident of Gomtipur, told the two retired High Court judges who began the fourth phase of hearings on the Ahmedabad riots, that the mob was heavily armed and even the police could not do much to control it.

The body of the Sales Tax officer, Devanand Solanki, was recovered with 28 stab injuries several days after he was dragged away.

This incident was corroborated by two other witnesses, Prakash Parmar and Geeta Ujjaini. They said another person named Vasant was dragged into the congested localities by the mob which was also firing with weapons.

Another witness, Rizwan Khan Pathan said that the sequence of events was well orchestrated to put the Muslims on the defensive. He said even when he and other residents shifted to a riot relief camp at the Char Tola Kabristan, neighbouring residents used to call up the police to complain that the residents of the camps were preparing to attack them. The police used to turn up in huge numbers and threaten the residents of the camps.

Jitendra Solanki, who claimed he was witness to the killing of a police constable Amar Patil in Gomtipur said that even other policemen who were in the vicinity could not save their colleague from being lynched.

He said that the police used to come often to his locality in Davit Chali and harass the residents unnecessarily for involvement in the riots.

5,Tea gardens bonus talks end inconclusively,"KOLKATA: The two-day bonus negotiations between the tea industry and the workersâ€™ unions in North Bengal concluded on Sunday without arriving at any solution. While the planters expressed their inability to pay more than 8.75 per cent, the unions were reluctant to climb down below 11 per cent.

In view of the ongoing acute cash flow problem faced bu the industry, the planters have expressed their inability to pay anything beyond 8.75 per cent as bonus. It is learnt that the major opposition to pay more than 8.75 per cent came from Duncan Industries Ltd, which has the maximum number of gardens in the Dooars as it is reeeling under severe financial crunch.

Last year, Category A gardens paid 12 per cent bonus.

The meeting also discussed the issue of inclusion of Tata Tea Ltd (TTL) in the bipartite bonus issue. This was for the first time that TTL had expressed its desire to settle the bonus issue at a bipartite level. Though there was stiff resistance by the unions initally over TTLâ€™s inclusion, later they agreed to the proposal.

Sources said there is a possibility of another round of meetings in the coming week over the now-inconclusive bonus issue.

6,Siddaramaiah fasts against anti-farmer policies,"MYSORE: Hundreds of Janata Dal(S) workers led by their state party chief Siddaramaiah staged a day long dharna and fast protesting the alleged anti-farmers policies of the state government.

JDS workers who descended here from various taluks and city areas at the deputy commissionerâ€™s office in the morning itself sat along with their leaders raising slogans against the Krishna-led Congress government.

Many of the former ministers and MLAs from the district also participated in this day long fast and dharna .

Later addressing the gathering Siddaramaiah in his scathing attack on Krishna government said Congress government in the state has become totally anti-farmer and drought conditions have come in handy for the Congress leaders to mint money by allegedly mis-utilizing the relief money meant for the rural areas.

â€œLife in rural areas has become miserable for the farmers with the anti-farmer policies of the state government which is interested in only developing IT sector and urban areasâ€� he charged adding that despite all these shortcomings Congress leaders are not bothered about rural areas, especially the farmers.

Questioning the foreign trips by ministers , particularly the home minister Mallikarjun Kharge who is head of the cabinet sub- committee on drought, JDS leaders said it indicated the anti-farmer orientation of the Congress leaders.

JDS cannot sit quiet when the farmers are suffering as it is a party nurtured by the farming community, he claimed and said JDS is determined to stand by the suffering farmers till Krishna led Congress government is thrown out of power.

Criticizing Krishna for his alleged follies in governing the state and in failing to come to the rescue of the farmers, Siddaramaiah wanted to know where had the heroic gestures of Krishna gone who, at the height of Cauvery agitation, declared that he is ready for blood-shed but would not release a drop of water .

Referring to Krishna and Poojariâ€™s statements on drought and farmers'' suicides the JDS leader said now with the elections to the state assembly fast approaching , both have started speaking about farmers. â€œPoojariâ€™s warning to the ministers and legislators itself indicated that so far they have not bothered about farmersâ€� he said adding that Poojari is admitting the party governmentâ€™s failure on the farmerâ€™s front by warning the legislators .

â€œMood among the farmers is one of determination - to throw out the Krishna government and this they will do in the next assembly electionsâ€� he said and predicted Congress being bundled out of power in the coming days .

District JDS president G T Devegowda, former minister D T Jaykumar, Venkatesh, ZP president Vanajakshi, and many other leaders including former MLAs , former mayors, corporators, Taluk Panchayt presidents and Zilla Panchayat members participated in this day long dharna.

7,Sena protests rail fare surcharge,"MUMBAI: Scores of Shiv Sainiks on Monday commuted on Mumbai''s suburban railway section without tickets to oppose the surcharge on suburban train tickets.

The surcharge of Re 1 on II class ticket and Rs 2 on I class fare came into force on Monday. The surcharge is aimed at raising funds for the Mumbai urban transport project.

Sena''s working president Uddhav Thackeray and senior party functionaries travelled ticketless between Churchgate and Bandra as part of the indefinite stir which is seen as the Sena''s yet another broadside against the BJP-led Centre.

""The Sena is a part of the ruling coalition at the Centre. Why did it not prevent the government from imposing the surcharge?,"" a commuter asked.

The Sena went ahead with its protest without its poll partner, the BJP, by its side. ""We have informed the Mumbai BJP to join the stir. We hope our ally will respond to our appeal in a positive manner,"" Mr Thackeray told TNN before the ''free rail journey'' began amid noisy demonstrations at Churchgate station during the peak hour.

""So what if the Sena stir is targetted against the Centre? The party''s committment to Mumbai''s commuters is incontrovertible. The Centre should have thought hundred times before imposing the surcharge. The Rail Bhavan didn''t clamp this draconian levy on Kolkata and New Delhi commuters,"" Thackeray said.

Meanwhile, the city BJP unit got in touch with the railway ministry on Monday immediately after the Sena started its rail-show.

""The BJP leaders from Mumbai will soon meet railway minister Nitish Kumar and ask him to put the surcharge on hold till the MUTP works enter a decisive phase. Money can be asked from Mumbaikars only if the MUTP showcases some tangible gains,"" said BJP MLC Vinod Tawde.

Sena MP Mohan Rawle said a high-level Sena delegation will submit a memorandum to Railway Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday seeking the abolition of the surcharge.

However, railway observers point out that the Sena''campaign against the surcharge is a case of too little too late. Railway sources told TNN that the idea of surcharge was mooted around the year 1998.

Incidentally, Sena-BJP were in power in Maharashtra at that time too. The memorandum of understanding for the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) a body to oversee the implementation of the rail projects under MUTP, was signed in the same year by the then chief minister Manohar Joshi and railway minister Nitish Kumar.

""Why did the Shiv Sena not opposed the surcharge issue at the outset?,"" an official questioned. The World Bank approved Rs 2600 crores for the MUTP last June but Sena was silent on the issue even then.

The levy surcharge is a part of World Bank''s loan condition to the Centre and state government.

8,UTI Bank to fund farming near Bhadrachalam,"MUMBAI: UTI Bank has on Monday entered into an agreement with Enterplan, UK to support a project to fund eucalyptus plantation farming near Bhadrachalam in Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh, which would involve lending to small and marginal farmers.

The project will be financially supported in the form of a capacity building grant (on a matching funds basis towards the overall infrastructure and set-up costs to be incurred on the project) by the Financial Deepening Challenge Fund set up by the UK Government''s Department for International Development.

The objective of FDCF is to support projects that are designed to extend financial products and services to very low-income sections of society.

UTI Bank''s agreement with Enterplan Limited, UK, (which is appointed by DFID, UK to manage FDCF worldwide, alongwith Deloitte & Touche), will enable a grant of GBP 92,083 to be made to the Bank over the next three years (by which time the project is expected to have become self-sustainable).

Dr. P J Nayak, Chairman and Managing Director, UTI Bank and Robert Neil Fitch, Chief Executive of Enterplan signed the contract today in Mumbai. Dileep Choksi, National Director for Financial Advisory Services, Deloitte Haskins & Sells, was also present for the signing ceremony.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Nayak said, ""This is a another step in augmenting the Bank''s priority sector lending and more so in direct agriculture, reaching out to small and marginal farmers who stand to be considerably benefited by this project.""

Fitch said, ""We are pleased to associate FDCF with UTI Bank in this venture. The project proves how a common mission can bring together various organizations, each with different corporate objectives.""

The project involves UTI Bank providing a long-term loan for five years to small and marginal farmers through a Plantation Farmers Cooperative Society formed at villages around Bhadrachalam for the purposes of undertaking contract farming under a social forestry project.

A corporate house will provide assistance in agri-extension activities such as procurement and supply of agri-inputs at low costs, technical advice in plantation and productivity, training to farmers and identification and screening of borrowers.

At the end of five years the corporate house will buy back the harvested tree produce, as part of their raw material requirement, from the farmers at an earlier contracted price and remit the loan repayments to the Bank directly.

The farmers would benefit in terms of availability of low cost organised credit and stability in harvest price realisation.

10,VHP to raise Ayodhya heat in polls,"NEW DELHI: The Sangh Parivar will get into the agitational mode during the heat of the coming assembly elections. The VHP on Monday said it will launch an agitation for the Ram temple construction on October 15.

After the monks'' conference, the VHP leader addressed a press conference here to announce that it would hold simultaneous protest demonstrations in Lucknow and Delhi on October 15 and then there would be a march towards Ayodhya by lakhs of Rambhakts. The march would end on October 17 in Ayodhya.

The VHP has asked the government to call a special session of Parliament before their agitation programme in order to pass the legislation. The purported aim for the demonstration and the march to Ayodhya, according to VHP working president Ashok Singhal is to ask all political parties to bring in the legislation for temple construction.

Basing all its arguments on the Archeological Survey of India''s report on excavations on the Babri site, the VHP claimed that it had waited enough but the Muslim bodies would continue the litigation for another 25 years and hence it is launching the agitation.

When asked why the VHP wants to march to Ayodhya while political parties would be busy with electioneering and why it cannot wait till Parliament''s winter session, Singhal said the organisation could no longer wait and said there was no election in Uttar Pradesh. But Delhi goes to polls along with three north Indian states that would be affected by the nationwide VHP campaign. The campaign for the programme begins on October 6 for a week till October 12 with 85 groups of monks spreading across the country to hold Sankalp Sabha through which the VHP claims it would reach out to two crore people in all the villages.

The president of the body of VHP monks, Mahant Avaidyanath referred to the 1990-91 temple agitation and December 1992 in particular when Babri Masjid was destroyed. He said ``We had showed our strength then and we would show it again.""

However the Parivar doublespeak was in evidence when Singhal said that the agitation this time would be peaceful and what the Mahant referred to was that the Rambhakts would show up in huge numbers as in 1992. This time around the VHP is not calling its cadre karsevak because, ""destruction can happen in five hours, but construction will take five years, that is why we need a piece of legislation,"" said the Mahant.

Singhal said that the march to Ayodhya would be peaceful and that his organisation would not break laws: ""But we don''t know what Mulayam Singh would do. Last time he had opened fire but this time we don''t think he would use force."" But when asked what the VHP would do if prohibitory orders are passed against the October 15 march, Singhal said that the VHP would have to break them.

11,Belgian firm to slowdown investment in India,"PUNE: This is another one India is losing to China. Bekaert Industries Private, manufacturer of steel products, has decided to freeze further investments into India.

The Belgian company is planning to cut down its production in the country by diverting about a 1000 tonne, of its current production capacity of 3500 tonne a year in its Pune facility, to China. It is also planning to import 3000 tonne of steel products from its facilities in China to India.

""The company has decided to slowdown its investments into India,"" Arnold Camelbeke, executive director of Bekaert told TNN. The advantage of low labour costs in India is totally offset by the price of power in the country, he said.

While labour costs in India are one-third of that in Belgium, the power costs in India are nearly three times of what it is in Belgium and are poised to go up even further, he added.

In addition, there is no guarantee of continuous and reliable power supply, according to Camelbeke. The company has faced 32 interruptions due to power failure in the first six months of this year, compared to 45 inturreptions in the year 2002.

""Even if a single ma-chine breaks down, it causes us huge losses in production efficiency,"" he said.

The decision to slowdown investments into the country is governed by the fact that power is the second largest head under operational cost for a steel company.

""We had originally planned to double our capacity in the country by this year, if power costs and import duties on our equipment (over 30 per cent currently) didnâ€™t continue to be so prohibitive,"" said Camelbeke.

The company has so far invested over $10 million in the country. Incidentally, it has two facilities in China to one in India and is planning a third to cater to the export demands.

This makes sense as both power costs and import duties in China are much lower, compared to India, said Camelbeke.

Bekaert manufactures 250 different steel and wire products including steel coats that reinforce radial tyres, hose reinforcements and nylon coated steel wires.

12,More arrests likley in stamp paper racket,"PUNE: The special investigation team, probing the Rs 3,000-crore fake stamp paper scam, on Monday indicated that more public servants are likely to be arrested.

""More people are involved. But we would not disclose who they are at this stage,"" special public prosecutor Raja Thakare told reporters after filing supplementary chargesheets against 16 accused in the case in the court of special judge S M Shembole.

He said the scam had a wider angle and alleged that many police officials had received money from Rashid Kulkarni, counsel for Abdul Karim Telgi, the alleged kingpin in the racket.

To a question if the SIT was trying to bring back Telgi, Thakare said the special judge had asked them to approach the Karnataka government through the Maharashtra government for his transfer.

He added that the SIT has also filed an application in the court, requesting its permission for filing another supplementary chargesheet and to conduct further investigations.

The SIT was now trying to get the case diary of the investigations from the Mumbai police.

The supplementary chargesheet filed on Monday was around 3,000 pages and the 16 accused include two official stamp vendors, one assistant police inspector, an advocate, and a sitting MLA.

Prominent persons who were chargesheeted were Samajwadi Janata Party MLA, Anil Gote, API Dilip Kamat and Rashid Kulkarni. Statements of 182 people were recorded, he said.

They have been booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), Stamps Act and Prevention of Corruption Act.

Of the 54 people to be arrested so far, only five more persons remain to be chargesheeted. They include TDP MLA, C Krishna Yadav, PI Dattarya Dhal and Abdul Wahid, who used to take care of Telgiâ€™s finances.

Dinesh Nabiyar and Hemant Bhogale, who made the positives for making the fake stamps, are also to be arrested.

Meanwhile, the bail applications of Gote and Kamat would come up for hearing on September 23. The case will come up for hearing on October 30.

13,Students' groups protest fee hike,"PUNE: Different students'' organisations in the city on Monday continued with their agitation against the prevailing uncertainty over the delay in admission and the fee structure to the engineering as well as medical courses.

While the Students'' Federation of India (SFI) gheraoed the joint director of technical education, SK Mahajan at his office, and demanded that the government take immediate steps to admit students on last year''s fee structure, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha said it would continue with its banner-poster protest throughout the city till the issue is resolved.

The Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena, on the other hand, announced that its members would beg for alms on Wednesday in front of Alka Talkies and hand over the contributions to chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to pay the fees for poor students, seeking admission to the engineering and medical courses.

""The government has miserably failed to protect the interests of poor students, and the new fee structure as proposed by private unaided colleges would only push the students and their families towards a debt trap,"" said BVS member Ganesh Satpute.

Meanwhile, college students in the city sported black badges in protest against the ongoing chaos in admissions to engineering and medical colleges.

The Shiv Sena had earlier appeal to the students'' community to wear black badges as a mark of protest against the state government for acting as ""an agent of the shikshan samrats.""

14,Haryana seeks greater bank credit for farmers,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government has urged NABARD and other banks to prepare schemes to provide credit to farmers for the purchase of modern implements like zero till-cum-fertilizer drill, bed planter,rotavators and straw reaper in view of the ensuing Rabi season and to promote diversification of crops.

State Director for agriculture, Rajeev Arora, who had a meeting here with senior officers of NABARD over the need of credit flow to farm sector, said that the thrust areas of farm sector were discussed in detail. These included land development, minor irrigation resource-conserving technologies, farm mechanisation, conjuctive use of brackish grondwater, organic farming, post-harvesting handling, primary processing, packaging and marketing.

He said that in view of WTO, the agriculture sector in Haryana would have to undergo commercialisation for which there was a need for precision farming, conservation of natural resources and giving a new look to the technologies of production. As such, the farmers would need more credit from banking institutions, he added.

15,Akshardham victims take arrests with pinch of salt,"AHMEDABAD: For most people closely following the investigations into the Akshardham attack last year, every bit of news about breakthroughs made by police in Gujarat and Kashmir just adds to confusion. More so for families of victims who died in that attack on September 24 last year.

They would like the culprits of the carnage, in which 33 lives were lost before the two terrorists were gunned down, to be brought to book.

But they do not know which story to believe as conflicting evidence is thrown up by police forces of the two states. If J & K police says it has landed a prize catch in Chand Khan, the person who admits he escorted the two terrorists to Ahmedabad, the Detection of Crime Branch (DCB), Ahmedabad, has booked five local persons who, it claims, master-minded the attack.

""The investigation into Akshardham attack is one big political stunt,"" says a bitter Rakesh Haathi,who lost his parents and three-and-half year old nephew Maulik in the attack.

Haathi feels that the government had derived political mileage out of the Akshardham incident and should be â€˜ashamed of the way it has failed to nab the real culprits for so longâ€™.

""For all you know, the police could be parading anybody as Akshardham accused and try to save the state governmentâ€™s face,"" says Haathi, who strongly feels that justice would have been done only if the two terrorists had been captured alive. Haathi is especially cross with the way the BJP government projected it as an attack on Hindutva but failed to keep its promise to pay Rs 50,000 ex-gratia promised by Prime Minister Vajpayee.

""I donâ€™t want the money but this apathy is just indicative of the hypocrisy of the government"", he says.

Randeep Chhabra, a victim of the Akshardham attack, is more cautious.

A resident of Kalol, Chhabra was at the temple along with his father Harvinder Singh Chhabra and cousin Gurmeet Singh Bagga. Harvinder Singh died in the attack while Randeep and Gurmeet were hit in their legs by flying shrapnel of grenades lobbed by the terrorists.

""The arrests and progress in investigation seems more like the reaction of a government working under pressure. It has been a year since the attack and now the five arrests suddenly crop up. But, if the link to the 9/11 attack at WTC can be rooted in Afghanistan then these arrests too may be genuine,"" said Chhabra.

Among the victims of the Akshardham attack was Ramvilas Jain, a resident of Uchana Mandi in Haryana. His cousin Sureshkumar Jain told TNN over telephone: ""I have my doubts over the investigation. If the right persons are being arrested then how does such incidents keep recurring ?""

Retired subedar of the Indian Army Gokul Singh still mourns the death of his son--NSG commando Subedar Suresh Kumar Yadav. His main grievance is that he is yet to be allotted a piece of land and petrol pump by the Rajasthan government as compensation for his sonâ€™s death. ""The real culprits should be caught and given the same treatment that they gave to devotees in Akshardham. Everyday I pray that my sonâ€™s death is avenged.""

16,BJP accuses govt of succumbing to pressure,"BANGALORE: The BJP on Monday accused the state government of succumbing to pressure from private managements of professional colleges on the seat allotment issue.

Speaking to reporters, opposition leader Jagadish Shettar and BJP MLA S. Suresh Kumar said:

""The 75:25 ratio for seat allotment through CET was a hoax. We were certain that there was a tacit understanding between the government and the managements and it has come to light.""

The leaders contended that by transferring all unfilled seats to the management, government has given its nod for selling seats. ""Profit has been recognised officially as the single motive of education in these colleges in clear violation of the Supreme Court directions. It is an irony that the notification for casual vacancy round is only for government and aided colleges and not for unfilled in private colleges,"" they said.

The BJP asked education minister G. Parameshwara to act in the interest of students or quit from his post.

17,No political meanings should be read into gesture: Thomas,"KOCHI: Even as a controversy is brewing over tourism minister, K V Thomas, presenting a memento to Israeli Prime minister, Ariel Sharon, during his recent Delhi visit, an unperturbed Thomas said on Monday that no political meanings should be read into the gesture.

Thomas told reporters here that the PMO wanted the mementos to be sent to Delhi to be handed over to Sharon, following which it was sent. During the Israeli dignitary''s visit, Thomas said he was in Delhi and was invited by the centre to attend a dinner hosted for Sharon, to which he had agreed.

At the function, Thomas said he was asked by Prime Minister A B Vajpayee, to hand over the gift to Sharon and he obliged.

He said he had not gone to the function as a representative of the state government.

Meanwhile, opposition leader V S Achuthanandan said that Thomas had brought `disgrace'' to the country and the state by meeting and presenting a memento to Sharon.

Thomas also came under heavy attack from Left parties and a section in the Congress for presenting the memento.

KPCC president K Muraleedharan told reporters at Thiruvananthapuram that the meeting was `unfortunate'' and would be brought to the notice of the High Command.

CPI state secretary Veliyam Bhargavan asked Antony to clarify if Thomas had cabinet approval to meet Sharon.The meet was ''fraught with mystery'' and if it had taken place without the ministry''s knowledge,he should be dropped from the cabinet

Thomas had presented Sharon a replica of fourth century documents of Maharaja of Cochin, allowing the Jewish community to reside and do business in Kerala.

18,CM urges farmers not to lose their composure,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Monday urged the farming community to take heart from the fact that the people of the entire state were firmly behind them and urged them not to resort to such extreme measures as suicides.

Speaking at the end of a meeting with intellectuals, academicians, psychologists and farmers here, the CM said: ""Suicides are an indication that not all is well with society. However, I wish to tell the farmers that the government and the people of the state are committed to removing their problems.""

Taking a philosophical stance, Krishna said: ""Suicides will not solve the problem. If anything it will only worsen the situation. The family will have to face additional problems.""

Hailing the farmer as a hardworker and one responsible for nurturing society, the CM called on everybody to empathise with the farmer''s plight. ""It is our duty to help him in his time of need. It is time to galvanise people to talk to farmers and instil courage,"" he stated.

Cooperation minister H. Vishwanath said the government had begun support price operations from Monday. ""For the first time we waived interest to the tune of Rs 127 crore and announced a Rs 880 crore package for farmers. It is regrettable that parties are using the suicides for political gains,"" he said.
