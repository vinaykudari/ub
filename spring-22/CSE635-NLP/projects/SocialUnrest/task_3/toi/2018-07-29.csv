0,Transco blames it all on farm sector,"hyderabad: if the industrial sector has been and continues to be the milch cow of sorts for the power sector managers in the state, then the agriculture sector continues to be ap transmission corporation limited's favourite whipping boy and a peg on which the company hangs all its losses. in fact, in its presentation to the ap electricity regulatory commission as part of the tariff hearings for the year 2001-2002, transco said as much stating that its losses would essentially be on account of excess agriculture consumption. there are nearly 20 lakh such connections of which 2.83 lakh are awaiting regularisation by the government. however, to be fair to transco, it also said some of these losses would be on account of lower than projected high tension sales. in fact, the agriculture sector has been in the eye of the storm ever since n t rama rao came to power and announced free electricity to the farmers. the farmers, who were paying rs 50 per horse power of pumpset capacity after free power was withdrawn, began paying, over the years, rs 250 per hp for pumpsets above 3 hp and below 5 hp. after the reform process took root, the rates for farm connections changed to rs 250 to rs 600 per hp per year. incidentally, transco has no means of determining the actual power consumed by this sector every year and the aim of having all farm connections metered is yet to be achieved, basically owing to the sensitive political nature of this constituency. the farm sector, which was among those hopefuls who were promised quality power in the post reforms era, still manages to get just about nine hours of power every day. in this sense, the reforms have hardly helped the sector either in terms of quality or quantity of supply. while transco and the state government, which owns the company, constantly claim that the farm sector does get nine hours of supply, the reality in many parts of the state is otherwise. interestingly, transco was told by aperc that it should take steps to meet the `technical performance standards set by the commission with respect to the quality of power. not only has the commission wanted the installation of capacitors for pumpsets ensured but also wanted the distribution companies to ensure nine hours of supply in one spell against the two or three instalments that is in practice. with respect to metering of agriculture connections, the present situation appears to be loaded against any such move on a large scale as this would immediately turn the heat on transco to cut down its transmission & distribution losses, a major portion of which have been for years conveniently clubbed with agricultural consumption.

3,More investment decision making powers for BSNL mooted,"new delhi: the communication ministry has favoured enhanced investment and financial-decision making powers for bharat sanchar nigam ltd (bsnl) than that bestowed on any navratna psu for speedier execution of expansion plans to face competition. ""we have had preliminary discussion with the department of public enterprises (dpe) and based on these discusions a proposal is being prepared by bsnl... in fact, they should get more powers than the navratna status,"" communication minister ram vilas paswan told newsmen in an interactive session. bsnl was the largest psu with double the asset base of any other corporation in the country, the minister said, adding ""bsnl being a service providing organisation, it needs to make quick decisions and sizeable investments calling for greater flexibility in investments."" with the investment limit fixed at rs 200 crore now for navratna psus, there was an urgent need to increase this limit for bsnl in view of severe competition in the telecom sector, the minister added. bsnl, which is currently a basic telecom service provider in the country except mumbai and delhi, is in the process of rolling out its cellular operations as well as basic services with limited mobility using wireless in local loop (wll) technology. paswan said that a status beyond navratna to bsnl was essential as the corporation was carrying social responsibility of connecting the rural area and at the same time competing with the private sector organisation. ""bsnl is present in many circles, which are not commercially viable and they say that with these obligations, either there should be some government assistance or some power should be given to take appropriate investment decisions,"" he said. bsnl has already finalised tender for procuring equipment for its proposed entry into cellular telephony by the year end, paswan said, adding pilot projects of bsnl were already going on in various cities. for wll operations throughout the country, especially in the rural areas, the corporation was in the process of inviting tenders for procuring the equipment.

4,BJP tells govt what to do,"new delhi: for the first time since coming to power at the centre as the head of a coalition in 1998, the bjp has asserted itself, virtually setting the agenda for the government at the party's three-day national executive. if party chief k jana krishnamurthy, in his address, did not mince words, the national executive's three resolutions --on the economy, the agra summit and the north-east--were all strongly-worded and critical of many aspects of government functioning. related stories also, after many years--possibly since l k advani's presidentship when the party grew enormously--there appeared to be a serious effort to tackle the organisational weaknesses that have crept in. advani, in his concluding address, focused on the building up of an organisation equipped to cope with the needs of the 21st century. he said the party should modernise itself and ensure that the workers were given the necessary intellectual inputs. the bjp--which, together with its earlier avtar as the jana sangh, will complete 50 years in october this year --spent so many years in the opposition, he said, that now it needed to make an effort to acquire the mindset of a ruling party. later, responding to criticism from certain quarters in the government that some of his comments had been too harsh, krishnamurthy stressed, ``we are not just the ruling party. we are a democratic party. if we don't express the feelings of the people and the cadres, how will the government know the reactions of the people?'' he was at pains to stress that the bjp's criticism of the government was different from that of the opposition as the former's ``feedback'' and ``suggestions'' --particularly on the economy and manipur--were intended to help the government. he said the ministers concerned had responded positively, and without resentment, by explaining governmental decisions and that this had helped in developing a better understanding between the party and the government. indeed, if the party hawks forced the pm to make a strident speech against pakistan on saturday, he was pushed by krishnamurthy's oblique criticism of pmk's re-entry into the nda into saying there should be norms for re-joining the ruling coalition and, further, that the pmk's entry would be confirmed only after a meeting of the nda. krishnamurthy on sunday said that an entry into the nda should not be regarded as synonymous with ministerial berths. he was, however, hardpressed to explain the entry of the rashtriya lok dal into the nda with the induction of ajit singh into the cabinet. finance minister yashwant sinha's handling of the us-64 issue also came in for criticism on the first day of the meeting. the government functioning came in for bitter criticism, in view of the us-64 mess, the failed agra summit, the u-turn on the naga ceasefire; more so because the bjp needs to gear up for key elections in uttar pradesh and punjab next year.

8,Violence likely to mar UP polls,"new delhi: if phoolan devi's murder is any indication, assembly elections in uttar pradesh are going to be a bloody affair. in the absence of an overriding issue, many observers believe the coming months will witness a blood trail follow the trajectory of electoral politics. it is apprehended that the poll campaign is likely to result in intense individual rivalry among candidates. this view is strengthened by the perception that the election outcome will depend more on the skills of the contending parties and their candidates rather than on the appeal of a cause or programme. ``it is apparent that the ayodhya issue cannot be revived any longer, nor is caste aspect that relevant, economic issues are going to dominate the political agenda. in such a scenario, violence can be unleashed by vested interests,"" former prime minister v. p. singh said. though it is not yet clear whether phoolan's killing had a political dimension or had been spurred by personal enmity, it has sent a sinister message that even high-profile politicians are vulnerable to the assassin's bullet. chief minister rajnath singh has agreed to review the security of all politicians in the state and promised strong measures to maintain law and order. samajwadi party chief mulayam singh yadav, whose party phoolan had represented in the lok sabha, has warned against the cult of violence. ``a spate of killings has been witnessed in different parts of up. incidents of violence are taking place almost everyday,"" he said. in the recent past, violent incidents with clear caste and communal overtones have erupted in different parts of the state. bsp leader mayawati has alleged that dalits are being terrorised. ``atrocities on dalits have suddenly increased,"" she claimed. with the assembly elections being seen as a direct confrontation between the ruling bjp and its rivals in its stronghold, candidates are likely to go all out to get the upper hand. and if the trends are any indication, the guns will rule much before the vote is cast.
