0,Al-Jehad terrorist arrested,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police crime branch on Tuesday claimed to have arrested an Al-Jehad terrorist, Peer Abdul Hai, from Adarsh Nagar in northwest Delhi.

According to the police, the outfit had sent Hai here to set up a base.

""He was ostensibly running a small eatery at Adarsh Nagar. This was, however, being used to conduct meetings with his associates. We have seized a Spanish pistol of 7.65 bore with three live cartridges along with Korean and Pakistani currency from him,"" said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Dependra Pathak. He added that Hai also used to deal in drugs and explosives.

The police said that Hai had a lavish lifestyle. They grew suspicious after they noticed a number of Kashmiri youths visiting him.

The police apparently accosted him in the Azadpur area on Monday evening. He was detained after he was found carrying the pistol and foreign currency.

""He had been staying here for the last six years. A number of Pakistani visa papers and other documents were recovered from him. He was closely associated with Abdul Majeed Dar, an area commander with the Hizbul Mujahideen. He is also the brother of Nasiruddin Malik, who died in an encounter with security forces near the Hazratbal shrine in 1995,"" added Pathak.

Hai had obtained a diploma in radiography from a private institute in Uttam Nagar.

The police said that earlier, Hai along with another Al-Jehad member, had crossed over to Pakistan where they met Afghan mercenaries. ""There, he learnt to handle weapons which included rocket launchers. He came back to Kashmir with 15 kg heroin which was supplied to buyers in Delhi,"" said Pathak.

Hai is being interrogated jointly by the Intelligence Bureau, military officials and the special cell of Delhi Police.

2,Traders bandh unsuccessful,"LUCKNOW: The state-wide bandh called upon by the Akhil Bharatiya Udyog Vyapaar Mandal (ABUVM) on Tuesday proved to be a damp squib due to factionalism. Traders supporting convener of the mandal Sandeep Bansal supported it; while those affiliated to the Lucknow Vyapaar Mandal (LVM) stayed away.

The bandh was called in protest against the alleged, deteriorating law and order, harassment of traders on the pretext of surveys and raids, imposition of CP tax and government''s decision to revive Section 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act.

Traders at Charbagh, Naka, Latousche Road, Alambagh, Thakurganj, and Sadar did business. And those under the Hazratganj Traders Association (HTA) also did not support the bandh. President of the HTA and senior vice-president of the LVM Kishen Chand Bhambwani informed Times News Network here on Tuesday: ""We closed shops for only an hour due to nuisance of processions, and security reasons; we do not support Bansal or his action.""

General secretary of the LVM and president of the Yahiyaganj Vyapaar Mandal Dinesh Kumar Agarwal termed the bandh as a flop show. The traders were satisfied with the Mulayam government, he added. The Petrol Pump Dealers Association also half-heartedly supported the bandh.

However, Bansal said, ""We took the action because the government did not solve traders'' long-pending problems. The traders completely supported the bandh.""

3,"OCR death: It's suicide, say police","LUCKNOW: Police say it is a routine case. Residents insist there is something fishy. And, in between, youngsters continue to fall to death from the twin towers of the OCR in Hussainganj more frequently than ever.

Little wonder, the police on Tuesday virtually closed the investigations into the latest case in which a teenaged girl ''fell to death'' from a top floor of OCR B-block on Monday. This incident has been dismissed as a mere ''accident'' or ''suicide'' by the police even as residents continue to be haunted by an uneasy calm enveloping the locality.

Over half a dozen persons have died during the last three years after hitting the ground from one of the top floors of the twin towers, two of whom were teenaged girls. Though there were two instances where the victims were found carrying suicide notes on their person, the deaths of two teenaged girls remained a mystery.

Interestingly, while sending the body of the girl who died on Monday for autopsy, police had claimed that they would seek a specific comment on the sexual status of the deceased by experts conducting the post-mortem examination. This came following pointed queries by mediapersons.

However, on Tuesday, police outrightly denied having made any such commitment and claimed that there was no such need as the kin of the deceased had not expressed any such suspicion. The case appear to be an open and shut one.

4,HC rubbishes govt plea on teachers issue,"PATNA: A division bench of the Patna High Court on Tuesday brushed aside the written and verbal contention of the Bihar government regarding relaxation in the minimum qualification for appointment of elementary (primary) school teachers in the state for which it has sought the approval of the National Council for Teachers'' Education (NCTE) and described it (state government''s contention) as ""rubbish"". The division bench comprised Chief Justice (CJ) Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh.

Advocate general Shashi Anugrah Narayan failed to answer the repeated queries of the CJ as to what were the special circumstances under which the state government sought NCTE''s approval for relaxation in the minimum qualification for the posts of elementary school teachers. Seeking NCTE''s approval for relaxation in the minimum qualification for appointment of teachers under the Bihar Elementary Teachers'' Appointment Rules, 2003 cannot be the special circumstances, the CJ said, adding that since 1991 the state government had been doing nothing for the appointment of elementary school teachers and approval of its proposal by the NCTE.

""Now, since the Union government wants the national programme of â€˜Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan'' to be implemented in all the states, the Bihar government, which was caught unawares, appears to be in a hurry to implement it,"" the CJ said.

Quoting the figures given by the Bihar government in its documents, the CJ asked the advocate general as to how the number of vacancies for elementary school teachers, which stood at 49,000 in 2001, dropped suddenly to 34,000 in 2003. The CJ described the government figures as ""rubbish"". He stated that the existing vacancies should be in the form of ""debit"" and ""credit"" of accountancy, detailing total sanctioned posts, vacancies filled and the ""balance"".

He said the Supreme Court order passed by Justice S C Agrawal had not been implemented by the state government till date. The state government did not even inform the apex court that it had already published an advertisement for appointment of elementary school teachers relaxing the minimum qualification for the posts, he added.

6,M&A round the corner: Principal talks to Alliance,"MUMBAI: The mutual fund (MF) industry is ringing with M&A activity. Principal MF is learnt to be in talks with Alliance Capital Management LP, USA, to buy out all schemes of Alliance Capital MF in India. This development follows close on the heels of UTI Mutual Fundâ€™s recent acquisition of IL&FS MFâ€™s schemes.

It is learnt that initial discussions were held between the Hong Kong subsidiary of Principal MF and Alliance Capital Management LP in Hong Kong. Sources said ABN Amro, Hong Kong, has been appointed by Principal to negotiate the deal. Alliance MF is controlled by its US parent through subsidiaries and holding companies.

Sanjay Sachdev, managing director of Principal MF, however, denied any buy-out talks with Alliance, whose officials also could not be contacted to confirm the development.

According to sources, the negotiations are being held in New York and the Indian management is not in the loop. â€˜â€˜After the fiasco last year when Allianceâ€™s plan to exit India was leaked, the parent company is not taking any chances,â€™â€™ a source said.

Alliance MFâ€™s former fund manager Samir Arora was banned by Sebi last year for allegedly trading on inside information. Sebi concluded that Arora had reached an understanding with Henderson Global Investors to buy out all the Alliance MF schemes. According to the Sebi order, a successful bid would have translated into immediate personal gain of Rs 10 lakh and another Rs 20 crore for Arora in 5 years. Arora has moved Securities Appellate Tribunal against Sebi order. According to Sebi, he had also threatened to quit working for Alliance MF if its schemes were not sold to Henderson.

As of January 31, Principal MF had total assets under management of Rs 3,656 crore while Alliance MF had Rs 2.306 crore.

8,Khanna blamed for misleading public over development projects,"PATHANKOT: Debunking the feel good factor of the BJP and claiming that Minister of State for External Affairs Vinod Khanna is ""misleading the people of Gurdaspur over development projects launched by him during the last six year,"" PPCC member and ex-president of Gurdaspur DCC Chanderpal Singh said on Wednesday that he was ""manipulating the facts and figures relating to MP Local Area Development funds."" However, BJP camp said money was sanctioned but the funds were not being released by local administration.

""Sudden announcement of Lok Sabha elections have woken up Khanna out of deep slumber and he has started making claims about various development grants,"" said Chander Pal in his statement.

Chander Pal who is the sitting vice president of DCC and kin of expected Congress candidate former minister Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder alleged that Khanna failed to utilise MPLAD funds. ""Khanna has not drawn till today even a single penny out of Rs 4 crore earmarked for the financial years 2003-03 and 2003-04. Nor did he submit any proposal to the district administration till January 28, 2004. Even an amount of Rs 51.47 lakhs pertaining to the year 2001-02 has been left unutilised.""

Chanderpal further said even utilisation certificates to the tune of Rs 274.54 lakhs have not been submitted which raises serious doubts about the utility and timely completion of of various projects. ""Vinod Khannaji himself acknowledged these facts when he attended the meeting of vigilance and monitoring committee held at Panchayat Bhawan in Gurdaspur on January 21 ,2004,"" the PPCC member said.

According to Chanderpal Khanna who submitted few proposals out of MPLADs funds on January 29, 2004 to the district administration only after the announcement of the Union Government about the dissolution of of Lok Sabha on Feburary 6, 2004 and publication.

On the contrary, BJP leaders in Pathankot alleged that while the Centre had sanctioned the MPLADS funds long time ago, the district administration was not releasing the funds being hand in glove with the ruling Congress government in Punjab.

Speaking at a SAD-BJP rally organised at Sekhwan on Monday, Khanna had also alleged that while Vajpayee government had sanctioned multi-crore funds under PM road yojna and majority of the road projects were completed in the last six years but the state government was taking credit for construction of the roads and manipulating credit by putting up sign boards of the state government and its minister while these roads were built with the Central funds.

Khanna said he had taken serious note of this and will bring to the notice of the concerned authorities to put the proper signboards at these roads that these were built under PM road yojna.

Having announced that he will be contesting Gurdaspur constituency as the common candidate of BJP-SAD on the poll plank of Able governance of Vajpayee and development, Khanna has been taking credit for construction of Mukerianâ€“Gurdaspur Bridge at Naushehra Pattan and Civil Airport at Pathankot and revival of the Dhariwal woollen mill but on the other hand Bhinder and her associates here have been claiming that the work was initiated during the tenure of erstwhile Congress government.

10,J&K govt paved way for Indo-Pak thaw: Azad,"JAMMU: The state Congress chief Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday said the credit for restoration of near normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir and the thaw in Indo-Pak relations should go to the PDP-led ruling coalition in the state and not the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

12,Mulayam makes education free in govt schools,"LUCKNOW: While no fresh taxes were proposed in the state''s annual budget for 2004-05, presented in the Vidhan Sabha on Wednesday, Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav amply tried to address his constituents by announcing a series of radical measures, predictably to compete with the BJP''s feel good factor in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

The budgetary gifts included free education up to class 12 in all government schools, appointment of 3000 assistant Urdu teachers, 2,300 science teachers under the madarsa modernisation programme and Urdu-Persian university at Rampur. Setting up of UP Arabic-Persian Madarsa Board, pension and gratuity benefit for teachers of Arabic-Persian madarsas which are on the grants-in-aid list and Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar Research Institute, also in Rampur, reduction in interest rate from six to three per cent on margin money loan scheme for miorities and cost-free computers to aided madarsas.

The government announced a host of schemes for farmers also. These included an insurance cover of Rs one lakh for farmers who would not be required to pay any premium. The budget allocated Rs 1664 crore for new schemes aimed at the development of rural areas.

The chief minister did not forget those of his fraternity and liberally increased the vidhayak nidhi (legislators'' discretionary fund) from the existing Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore.

While making the budgetary provisions the government clearly had an eye on the coming Lok Sabha elections. It turned a blind eye to the worrisome state of its borrowings. During 2003-04, the government''s debt burden is estimated to be Rs 107922.4 crore, which is 49.5 per cent of the state''s GDP. The borrowings are estimated to climb to Rs 115254.6 crore in 2004-05.

Despite the massive debt burden the budget showed an estimated net saving of Rs 456.59 crore after taking into account all the revenue transactions in 2004-05. This is the first time in a decade that the government is projecting a net saving.

Yet, because of the adjustments against the carry over burden of Rs 1074.7 crore, there is a yawning deficit of Rs 618 crore which was left uncovered.

Mulayam promised to reduce the deficit and said that the disbanding of nine districts and four divisions would save an unproductive capital investment of over Rs 4000 crore and a recurring expenditure of over Rs 500 crore annually.

Out of the plan outlay of Rs 8500 crore, Rs 1664 crore have been earmarked for new schemes in rural areas. Of the new schemes, 88 per cent are for capital investment.

At his post-budget press conference, Yadav said: ""Austerity measures would be taken to control expenditure and trade tax recovery would be stepped up by checking tax evasion. As the announcement on free education came as a last minute addition, its cost to the exchequer was not immediately known.

But Yadav said that funds would not be allowed to come in the way of free education, a policy to which his government was committed.

The budget contained several dramatic steps, but managed to hide more than it revealed. For example, it was not immediately clear from where the additional resources would be mobilised by the government to meet its projected target of revenue receipts of around Rs 61264.92 crore and reduce the borrowings which is constantly swelling.

The budget brief prepared by the finance department, however pinned its hope on revenue receipts of Rs 37,258.62 crore and Rs 23345.81 crore as capital receipts. Apart from this, it also indicated a target to secure external assistance at cheap interest rates and also hoped to reduce the debt burden successively by raising internal resources.

13,Mulayam govt to fall soon: Kalyan,"LUCKNOW: The newly-appointed chairman of the 14-member BJP Poll Management Committee Kalyan Singh on Wednesday caused a flutter by announcing that the mid-term Assembly polls could be held in Uttar Pradesh alongwith Lok Sabha.

""Political situation in Uttar Pradesh was changing fast. People were fed up with the misrule of the present government which may fall sooner than expected,"" declared Kalyan during the joint working committee and state council meeting at Ravindralaya on Wednesday.

Launching an attack on the rainbow coalition, Kalyan said that it has failed on all fronts. ""The crime graph was spiralling on each passing day. The government has done nothing to redress grievances of farmers. There is total anarchy in the state,"" said Kalyan, who was part of the coalition till last month.

Changing track soon after his homecoming, it was for the first time that Kalyan came out in open against Mulayam-led coalition government keeping in mind that his party''s main fight would be with the Samajwadi Party followed by BSP and Congress.

The BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan too made it clear that Samajwadi Party and BSP were their main opponents in the state as the Congress was nowhere in the contest in Uttar Pradesh. ""Congress was no challenge to BJP in Uttar Pradesh. Samajwadi Party and BSP are main opponents,"" he told.

Thus, the advice was to mount attack on the Mulayam government and use the anti-incumbency factor in favour of the Lotus. Accordingly, highlights of Katiyar''s inaugural and Kalyan''s speeches were misrule of Mulayam government besides rendering of `Atal mantra''.

A word of caution came from the Union minister Sangh Priya Gautam. ""The party state ladership should put up a united front to achieve the target,"" advised Gautam causing a flutter by openly taking names of leaders who were responsible for party''s debacle in 1999.

Taking cue from the party high command, the BJP state unit on Wednesday passed on the `Atal mantra'' to party leaders and workers for sailing through the Lok Sabha polls.

Atal, Atal and Atal, speeches of party state president Vinay Katiyar, newly-appointed chairman of 14-member Poll Management Committee Kalyan Singh as well Union Agriculture minister Rajnath Singh, state incharge Kalraj Mishra and other party leaders during the joint working committee and state council meeting on Wednesday revolved in glorifying Vajpayee and achievments of his government.

Directions were issued accordingly to party workers. The message was to keep fluid political situation in the state also in mind while launching campaign for Lok Sabha polls.

The party has chalked out a two-pronged strategy -- step up attack on Mulayam-led coalition and take the `Atal sandesh'' to people to counter whatever little effect Gandhi family has on masses in the state.

To achieve the target, the party has oragnised a series of seven more rallies in February and planned to take out Atal Sandesh yatras and meetings in all 80 Lok Sabha constituencies by March.

14,Poacher arrested for selling leopard pelts,"GHAZIABAD: The police on Tuesday night arrested a poacher, Jagat, who was trying to sell leopard pelts near the state housing board guest house at Vasundhara.

Two pelts have been recovered from him. The buyer, however, did not appear at the spot. Jagat who hails from Himachal Pradesh told the police that over the past four years, he had killed and sold the pelts of about 20 leopards and other carnivores.

Ghaziabad superintendent of police (city) Umesh Srivastava said, â€˜â€˜He has revealed that he used to kill these animals by rubbing poison onto the backs of sheep or goats so that a carnivore eating these animals would die.â€™â€™

Srivastava said Jagat used to sell leopard skins to buyers in Moradabad and Delhi at prices ranging from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh. It is suspected the buyers used to sell these in the international market for higher prices.

15,"A different policy for Sainik Farms, Neb Sarai","NEW DELHI: The road running between Sainik Farms and Neb Sarai divides the colonies into two worlds. While part of Neb Sarai is likely to be regularised under the current set of guidelines, properties across the road in Sainik Farms are not that lucky.

The spate of contradictory statements have left residents even more anxious. â€˜â€˜There are colonies like Freedom Fighters Enclave, Neb Valley and Saudulajahib where residents have constructed palatial homes. There is no clear line demarcating Sainik Farms from these neighbouring colonies, but there are different policies for us,â€™â€™ said Sainik Farmsâ€™ Residents Welfare Association president, Om Pathak.

According to a recent statement made by the Union urban development minister, Sainik Farms is unlikely to be regularised because it is on private land, while those who have encroached on public land will have to pay development charges, depending on the category they belong to.

Residents complain that despite taking care of all civic needs they have received the short end of the stick from authorities. â€˜â€˜Economic status cannot be an enabling or disabling factor. We do not take any facility from any civic body and yet we have been put in Category B under the unit area method of property tax. Why should we pay such high tax?â€™â€™ Pathak asked.

According to residents, both the state and Centre are unclear about the land use. â€˜â€˜The Centre has said that it is a green belt while the DDA has submitted an affidavit saying Sainik Farms is agriculture land. We are willing to pay development charges but when the authorities themselves are not clear about what use the land is to be put to, how can they accuse us of misuse?â€™â€™ a resident added.
