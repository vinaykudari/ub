1,SJM flays govt for ignoring BKS,"AHMEDABAD: The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, which criticised the Modi government for not initiating dialogue with the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh towards an amicable settlement, said the delay in dialogue with the agitating farmers may further aggravate the situation.

SJM''s national convenor Prof. Murlidhar Rao and Bhagvati Prasad Sharma, who were here to participate in three-day national convention said on Sunday, ""It was improper on part of the state government to ignore the genuine problems of farmers for such a long time"" Demanding that the government immediately invite BKS representatives to sort out the problems through negotiations, the manch hoped that the confrontation ended in the larger interests of the agriculturists.

While referring to the resolutions adopted at the convention, they said that the manch would continue its agitation against policies of globalisation being pursued as a part of WTO agreement.

""Under no circumstances the government should open the service sector mainly the retail trade financial services under GATT-2000 negotiations,"" it said. The meeting also adopted a resolution urging the centre to invoke a moratorium on the GATT-2000 negotiations in the larger interests of the country.

""The SJM has pleaded that government be cautious against the designs of International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and multilateral development institutions trying to rope in multinational firms in the service of the public sector and in services where government departments have a role in deciding the service provider.""

The manch demanded that the government conduct a full assesment of the impact of a GATT regime on India''s social, environmental and economic performance, policies and programmes. At the same time, efforts should be made to develop mechanisms for effective participation of nationalist organisations and formulations of the government position and negotiations.

In another resolution passed at the convention, the SJM expressed serious concern over increasing unemployment in all sectors and demanded that the centre implement the recommendations made by S P Gupta Committee appointed at the instance of planning commission.

Calling upon the people to form pressurise groups against the multi-national companies aimed at weakening the country''s sovergnity, the manch said necessary amendments were needed in the agreements.

2,Surat police arrest 12 in diamond loot case,"SURAT: With the arrest of 12 miscreants, including six of an Agra-based gang, the city police on Sunday claimed to have cracked the sensational diamond robbery which took place on October 7 last. Police has also recovered diamonds, vehicles and cash amounting to Rs 41.21 lakh from the accused held in the case.

Two employees of a diamond firm were attacked by three unidentified persons near Umiyadham and a bag containing diamonds worth Rs 50 lakh snatched from them.

The diamond robbery, conducted in broad day light, had sent shock waves through the diamond industry and with no clinching evidences left behind by the culprits, police had to grope in the dark for nearly three months.

However, police were on trail of some four gangs with track-record of such offences and even unearthed another diamond loot case of Rs 7.50 lakh in the process. Three miscreants, namely Harsukh Patel, Mangalsinh Gaiga and Kalu Gaiga were nabbed in the raid in Umergaon in Valsad, said police commissioner V K Gupta here.

Around Diwali last year, the crime branch was tipped about the involvement of one Narsinh Naran Patel and Ranchhod Dhola in the diamond loot case at Umiyadham.

A close watch was being kept at their residences in Katargam and their movements were being tracked by the police, Gupta added A police team even followed the duo to Malad Diamond Trading Centre in Mumbai and seized diamonds worth over Rs 2 lakh and Rs 21,700 in cash from them on Monday last, Gupta revealed.

Interrogations led to arrest of four local accomplices Babu alias Bharat Nasit, Bharat Patel, Jagdish Galani and Manoj alias Munna Dhakeya, who were all held by the crime branch here.

Further interrogations revealed that Jagdish Galani was earlier working with the diamond firm whose employees the gang looted on October 7. Galani was terminated after his involvement in an earlier diamond theft case came to light, crime branch inspector Jhala informed.

Galani along with five others planned to loot an â€˜angadiyaâ€™ and accordingly, they engaged the services of an Agra-based gang. Accordingly, Amar Yadav, Kishan Jat, Tejsingh Sardar, Jaipraksah Sharanidhar, Rajeshwari and Ramadeviâ€”all from Agra and nearby areas in Uttar Pradeshâ€”were employed for the job, said Gupta.

The gangsters from UP had checked in at one Dimple guest house here four days before the incident, officials revealed.

All of them were taken custody by the city police team in Agra on Friday and are presently in police remand here upto Januray 20, he added.

Terming it a major success, Gupta said that attempts were on to arrest an absconder named Sanjay and recover rest of the looted diamonds.

3,Saibaba temple: DF govt seeks control again,"MUMBAI: The Democratic Front government is making yet another attempt to take over the management of Saibaba temple at Shirdi by issuing an ordinance.

Law and judiciary minister Govindrao Adik told TNN on Saturday that the government was planning to get a fresh cabinet approval for a revised draft ordinance in order to transfer the management of the temple to a government-controlled body.

The Shri Saibaba Sansthan, which currently runs the temple, has surplus funds of Rs 180 crore, making it the richest temple trust in the state.

Last year, the Vilasrao Deshmukh government had prepared a draft ordinance but could not get it approved by the governor in time. The government headed by Sush i l kumar Shinde was forced to then seek a legislative passage of the draft in the form of a bill during the monsoon session.

However, within a few days of moving the bill in the legislative council, the government was forced to withdraw it for want of general consent.

Mr Adik said, ""I had withdrawn the bill to take the views of all parties in the interest of better management of the temple.""

Now, NCP president Sharad Pawar has suggested some changes in the draft ordinance, with a thrust on representation of backward classes in the managing committee and reducing of government control in day-to-day workings of the temple.

Mr Adik said the changes proposed by Mr Pawar were ""minor"" and have been incorporated in the revised draft. ""This draft will now have to be re-approved by the Cabinet,"" he said, without giving a time-frame for the clearance.

If the move succeeds, the Shri Saibaba Sansthan trust will join the ranks of the Siddhi Vinayak temple in Mumbai, Mahalaxmi Devsthan at Kolhapur and the Vithal temple at Pandharpur, which have statutory trusts and separate laws governing them.

The attempt to push through an ordinance one more time after the first one couldnâ€™t make it has drawn criticism from the incumbent trustees and some devotees as well.They wonder at the urgency to push through the ordinance, especially when the term of the incumbent trust expires in August 2004.

""Why canâ€™t it wait till then?"" demanded a trustee. ""The government is in the election mode and probably wants to help themselves to our funds to boost their poll prospects,"" he alleged.

Indeed, many fear misuse of the templeâ€™s surplus funds. A trustee said that in order to pre-empt any attempt by the government to have a say in the use of these funds, certain prerequisi tes were necessary in the ordinance.

""The disbursement of funds should be made in accordance with Section 35 of the Bombay Public Trust Act which currently applies to the management of the temple,"" he said. ""If the funds are diverted for bailing out, say, some public sector units running at a loss, it would be a disservice to the devoteesâ€™s sentiments.""

If the ordinance really aims at ""better management of the templeâ€™s affairs"", as the government claims, trustees say it should contain a clear enunciation of the aims and objectives of the new managing committee.

The investment of funds should not be on the dictates of the state government, they said. Another trustee feared diversion of funds to charity institutions run by politicians as is allegedly being done with the Siddhi Vinayak temple trust.

""The new committee should follow a transparent process of selecting voluntary agencies for donations,"" he said.

4,LS elections may be held in March or May: Badal,"SEKHWAN: Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal, on Sunday, speculated that the Lok Sabha elections could be held as early as March or in May and evinced hope that the SAD-BJP alliance would win all the 13 seats in Punjab.

Extolling the virtues of Vajpayee as a ""astute politician"" and calling AICC president Sonia Gandhi as a weak candidate for Prime Ministership, Badal, at a rally organised by Sucha Singh Langah and Nirmal Singh Kahlon here, reminded his party rank and file that Vajpayee always bailed out Punjab out of every crisis and extended liberal financial help.

The Congress had worked against the interests of Punjab and Punjabis settled elsewhere in the country, alleged Badal adding that Soniaâ€™s foreign origin could also be a big poll issue.

""As evident from the results of assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajashtan and Chattisgarh, she may prove to be a liability for the Congress and its alliance partners, as she cannot take them to the victory stand,"" said the former chief minister.

Lambasting the Amarinder Singh government, Badal said that the Congress government was a â€˜spent forceâ€™ for not having executed any development in Punjab.

5,RLD to go with SP in LS elections,"LUCKNOW: The state unit of the Rashtriya Lok Dal will hold a Kisan Sankalp Jan Jagaran fortnight beginning February 1.

The party has also decided not to be part of any coalition for the impending parliamentary elections which does not have Mulayam Singh Yadav''s Samajwadi Party as its constituent.

Addressing a press conference, RLD MLC Munna Singh Chauhan said no political conclusion should be drawn from the meeting between party president Ajit Singh and Congress Party president Sonia Gandhi.

He discounted any talks of a Congress-RLD pact for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls and said the party was currently engaged in making the present coalition strong.

The MLC said the RLD would be part of only such a coalition which had the Samajwadi Party as its constituent and that the two would be contesting the polls together.

He said the party would hold a fortnight-long Kisan Sankalp Jan Jagran programme where chaupals would be held in every village and the people would be told about the pro-farmer steps taken by Ajit Singh during his tenure as the Union agriculture minister.

He added the RLD was totally committed to the cause of farmers.

Slamming the central government the MLC said it was indifferent to the causes and issues which concerned farmers the most. While sops in various forms were being doled out to industrialists the government maintained it had no money for farmers.

The fact was that there was no shortage of money with the government but it fell short on the issue of ''niyat'' (intention).

Elaborating, he said when the Union government decided to fix the sugarcane price it consulted mill owners but did not hold a meeting with the representatives of the sugarcane growers.

8,BJP targets Sonia in political resolution,"HYDERABAD: Recommending Lok Sabha polls as early as possible, BJP on Monday said it deserved a second term as it did not get â€˜sufficient timeâ€™ to accomplish its mission in five years and the opposition is cleaved by â€˜disunity and distrust.â€™

Targeting the Congress specially and the foreign origin of its president Sonia Gandhi, the party''s political resolution adopted on the concluding day of the two-day National Executive here attended by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, said â€˜as far as the BJP is concerned, we are firmly of the view that only India-born Indian citizens should occupy the country''s top positions.â€™

It said the Congress, panicked by the prospect of suffering another defeat in the Lok Sabha election, has become a â€˜sudden convertâ€™ to the virtues of coalition politics. However, its moves lack credibility since everyone knows that the Congress is doing this out of compulsion.

""The Congress is not seen as a trustworthy party as it has a history of destabilizing unfriendly governments,"" the resolution said.

9,Dowry laws apply to void marriages: SC,"NEW DELHI: In a significant judgement, the Supreme Court has ruled that a husband could be punished for demanding dowry during a second marriage even if he proves that the second marriage was not a valid marriage as he had not divorced his first wife.

Setting aside a Punjab and Haryana High Court order rejecting the application of an unfortunate wife, a Bench comprising Justice Doraiswamy Raju and Justice Arijit Pasayat asked the High Court to reconsider the matter again.

Writing for the Bench, Justice Pasayat said the objective behind the enaction of Dowry Prohibition Act was to prevent harassment to a woman who enters into a marital relationship with a person and later on, becomes a victim of the greed for money.

""Can a person who enters into a marital arrangement be allowed to take a shelter behind a smokescreen to contend that since there was no valid marriage, the question of dowry does not arise?,"" he observed.

Justice Pasayat said when the legislature had enacted laws relating to legitimacy of children born out of invalid marriages, could it be conceived that they ""closed their eyes to the plight of a woman who unknowingly or unconscious of the legal consequences entered into the marital relations.""

10,Mamata bends govt policies to win hearts,"KOLKATA: Barely three days into her ministry, Mamata Banerjee scored a political point by averting a strike at Coal India headquarters on Monday.

But, in the process she made promises which could reverse some of the important policy decisions which the Centre had been pursuing for quite some time.

""There will be no strike in Coal India,"" she announced in a Press conference after a meeting with CIL officials and trade unions. Amid cheers from assembled employees, she announced a 15 per cent interim relief for CIL workers, pending wage negotiations which could take about six monthsâ€™ time.

In the bargain, however, she made sweeping announcements, formalised as a written agreement between the CIL management, trade union representatives and the coal ministry.

Among them were a protective tariff on imported coal and the setting aside of the Coal Mines Nationalisation (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which provided for handing over coal blocks to private parties for developing mines and selling coal in the open market.

The Bill had not been placed, however, in the Rajya Sabha for lack of requisite support. Trade unions had also been demanding that customs duty on imported coal be restored to the pre - 1991 level.

She also announced that no coal mine would be closed in the Eastern Coalfields, the Bharat Coking Coal, the Central Coalfields and the North Eastern Coalfields and there would be no retrenchment of workers. Annulling the Central decision to close 64 ECL mines which would have rendered jobless nearly 60,000 workers, she thundered, ""No mine anywhere will be allowed to be closed and none will be rendered jobless.""

Assuming office as coal minister when the Lok Sabha election is virtually knocking at the door, the immediate challenge that she had faced was the impending week-long coal strike from February 23, for which five major trade unions affiliated to the INTUC, the BMS, the AITUC, the CITU and the HMS had served a notice.

The unions ensured, however, that three of the major demands in the eight-point charter of demands presented in the strike notice were accepted by the minister. They had demanded interim relief of 25 per cent, but finally settled for 15 per cent.

Some of the assembled union leaders were visibly impressed with the stand of the minister. â€œShe has a positive approach. She has promised that she will look after the interest of workers and also expedite the wage negotiations,â€� INTUC organizing secretary Amal Banerjee said.

11,Dowry laws apply to no marriages: SC,"NEW DELHI: A man who breaks his marriage proposal over demand for dowry is also liable to face the charges under the various anti dowry penal laws, the Supreme Court has ruled.

The laws meant to curb the menace of dowry or harassment to women are applicable to such a man and also whose marriage is void in law, such as second ""marriage"" while the first one is subsisting.

In a major ruling also which gives new dimension to the penal laws relating to dowry prohibition in the country, a Bench of Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Pasayat wondered, ""can a person who enters into a marital arrangement be allowed to take a shelter behind a smokescreen to contend that since there was no valid marriage the question of dowry does not arise?""

The judges said: ""Such legalistic niceties would destroy the purpose of the provision.""

The judges further said: ""Such hairsplitting legalistic approach would encourage harassment to a woman over demand of money.""

The apex court explained that, ""the nomenclature dowry does have any magic charm written over it. It is just a label to demand of money in relation to marital relationship.""

Setting aside a Punjab and Haryana High Court order rejecting the application of an unfortunate wife, the Bench asked the high court to reconsider her matter again.

The petitioner wife committed suicide over dowry allegedly by her in laws. But the trial court and the high court held that her marriage with one Anupam was void as his first marriage was subsisting. Therefore, the accused not be tried and convicted under the anti-dowry laws.

When the legislature had enacted laws relating to legitimacy of children born out of invalid marriages, could it be conceived that they ""closed their eyes to the plight of a woman who unknowingly or unconscious of the legal consequences entered into the marital relations.""

The court also said that in the absence of a definition of word ""husband"" to specifically include such persons whose first marriages were subsisting could not be a ground to exclude them from the purview of sections 304B or 498a of the Indian Penal Code.

13,"PMK quits NDA, calls back ministers","CHENNAI: Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) on Monday quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and joined the proposed ''progressive front'', leaving the BJP devoid of all its coalition partners in Tamil Nadu.

Announcing the decision after an hour long political affairs committee meeting here in the evening the PMK founder leader S Ramadoss also said that two of its minister in the Union government, Minister of State for Railways A K Moorthy and Minister of State for Food Processing N T Shanmugam, would also be called back. They would submit their resignations to the Prime Minister A B Vajpayee on Tuesday.

It may be recalled that last month the DMK, leader of the alliance in Tamil Nadu pulled out, followed soon after by the MDMK. However, PMK was not keen on withdrawing from the alliance immediately as Ramadoss felt that it was too early and that the election was far off.

However, on Monday, with the BJP national conference favouring an early election, most likely in April, the PMK, with four MPs, decided to pull out of the alliance.

The DMK president M Karunanidhi, who is spearheading a likely front, named ''progressive front'', along with the Congress at the Centre, to polarise all parties against the ruling AIADMK had been appealing to the PMK to come out of the NDA and had even expressed optimism that the PMK would join the front he is building up.

""We are getting ready to teach a lesson to the ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu and we do not want to go against the will of the people,"" said Ramadoss after the meeting. He clarified that his party was quitting because the vote against the AIADMK should not be split: ""We are parting company as friends.""

He charged the AIADMK of adopting ""anti-people policies"" and contended that though Vajpayee had not deviated from the national agenda of governance, he did not pay due attention to the various issues affecting the people of Tamil Nadu, such as the Cauvery issue. His party, therefore, wished to join the ""secular progressive front.""

Saying this Ramadoss rushed to meet Karunanidhi. After the two met, Karunanidhi said that the new front would contest all 40 seats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry and his front would sweep. Ramdoss agreed: ""It will be a clean sweep for us in both Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry."" They said that the seat sharing would be worked out later.

14,Sonia's visit puts govt officers in tight spot,"BATHINDA: For Congress leaders in this area January 15 visit of AICC president Sonia Gandhi is a defining moment. But for the government officers who have been given the responsibility of making the programme a huge success in a period of five days it a really a harsh time.

The Congress is hoping to put a gathering of one lakh people at the rally. More over, the state government in no uncertain terms conveyed to the administrations of the neighbouring seven districts-Muktsar, Moga, Faridkot Mansa, Sangrur and Bathinda- to make all arrangements of ferrying one lakh people to the rally venue on January 15.

Every panchayat secretary, block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) and district development and panchayat officers (DDPO) have been given the responsibility of herding a particular quota of people of their areas to the rally.

The district transport authorities of the area have been directed to make arrangements of trucks and buses. To every village, two trucks would be sent on January 14 to ferry party workers on January 15 to the rally venue, told KP Brar, ADC Bathinda while giving details of preparations in a meeting convened by Rajinder Kaur Bhattal here on Tuesday. For Bathinda district alone 600 trucks are required.

Bhattal said BDPO, DDPO and ADC would be responsible to see that vehicles reached every village on January 14 evening. Bhattal said she would reach Bathinda January 14 to monitor arrangements herself.

Despite the fact that state government has released Rs 36 lakh on Monday to rural development department to make expenditure for January 15 rally but the authorities are still facing financial problem in arranging many programmes.

The senior party leaders wanted that singer of stature like Gurdas Mann or Hans Raj Hans be engaged to amuse the people at the rally but sources revealed that no artist of reputation was ready to perform at the rally for the government a bad paying master.

As most of the artist have had outstanding dues toward government so they have one pretension or the other to not perform at the rally. One artist has agreed after she was given in advance Rs 25,000 on Monday.

During Monday meeting, Surinder Singla directed the district authorities to purchase huge garlands, to welcome Sonia Gandhi, from a south state. The MLA suggested the administration to bring also the life-size cutouts of Sonia Gandhi from Delhi and decorate the city with these on January 15.

As the state government wants to get the newly built district administration complex inaugurated from Sonia, so the plantation is being carried out at large speed near the building .

This is despite the fact that the district administration does not want Sonia to inaugurate the building because of the poor condition of the roads approaching the building and parking problem. But in the meeting, if Bhattal said the approach road could be laid in few hours, a party MLA said helicopter could be used to bring Sonia to the building.
