0,Stay on Ketan Mehta’s arrest,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked film maker Ketan Mehta to appear before the Crime Branch on March 4 and co-operate with the investigating agency probing a three-year-old cheating case against him.

Mehta and four others have been accused of defrauding the Prasar Bharati of more than Rs 12.10 crore. Justice R S Sodhi passed the order while putting a stay on a non-bailable warrant (NBW) issued against Mehta. Sodhi told Mehtaâ€™s advocate that the stay would remain till March 4.

Mehta had approached the high court against an NBW issued against him and four more persons in the cheating case. The state counsel V K Malik said:â€˜â€˜The accused were not appearing before the police despite several reminders.â€™â€™

The police, thereafter, filed an application before the court of metropolitan magistrate Digvinay Singh who issued the NBW against Mehta on October 14. While appearing on behalf of Mehta, Sandeep Sethi argued for the film-makerâ€™s representative to appear before the police and answer their queries.

Sethi claimed the film-maker was busy with his schedules and prior commitments. As per the case registered against Mehtaâ€™s Maya Entertainment and four other companies, they had entered into a contract with Prasar Bharati for the telecast of Hindi films on 52 Saturdays on Doordarshan.

They submitted fixed deposits and bank guarantees of Rs 12.10 crore to Prasar Bharati. The bank guarantees belonged to a weak bank whose paid-up capital was even less than Rs 70 lakh. â€˜â€˜The bank did not have such a huge amount as per the instructions issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The anticipatory bail application of one of the accused, Neelesh Dalal, has already been dismissed by the high court,â€™â€™ said Malik.

1,US dreams caught in adoption laws,"HYDERABAD: Sachin and Satish want to be in the US. There are many like them at Tender Loving Care Home (TLCH), a private adoption home at Sanatnagar.

Trouble is, neither 11-year-old Satish nor 14-year-old Sachin know that the courts have clearly stated that foreigners come only second in the adoption line. Indians get the first priority. Still, Satish and Sachin want to be in homes in the US, Italy or even in Holland.

But when they were moved into the TLCH, they never wanted to be in some foreign home. They were told that somebody from a distant land would come and take them away. Besides, all these days they''ve had Americans, Britons or even a stray Hollander come and shower them with gifts. So many such couples have called on them, pampered them and vanished.

Not for once did the tender mind at the adoption home know that outside, a legal battle was raging on about who should have the first right to adopt a child.

One of 31 children at the TLCH, Satish,who used to suffer from frequent fits, still dreams of a home in the US. ""That day, mummy came from the US and someday, I''ll go there. I love animals and learning the tables,"" he says.

""The boy had been suffering from tuberculosis and slight epilepsy. We got him treated. He''s an intelligent child and sharp with numbers,"" TLCH director Sister Maria Teresa said.

""Several Indian parents have come to see Satish. That was when he was much smaller. They didn''t take him. So, we proposed an inter-country adoption for him. We even got an NOC for his case. But when a US couple came forward to accept him, the courts came in the way,"" she said.

Similar is the case with Sachin. He was told that his Italian parents were waiting to take him home. ""Sachin was five when we got him here. He had been abandoned. He was a reluctant learner, but constant counselling improved him and today, he goes to Birdie, a Don Bosco training centre at Golconda. He''s interested in painting, speaks a smattering of English and has picked up a bit of Italian as well.

He has a knack for repairing electrical gadgets,"" Sister Teresa says. But what stops Sachin and Satish from finding Indian parents? ""Procedural delays,"" says Rami Reddy, director, women and child welfare department.

Besides, there are several cases pending in the courts. Indeed, there are as many as 300 couples wanting to adopt children. So, there''s no dearth of parents.

""True, but we are very careful about the abilities and intentions of the couples wanting to adopt our children,"" says Sister Teresa. Her home has given out as many as 600 children for adoption in the past few years.

""It really doesn''t matter if the parents are from the country or from abroad. Our only concern is the care they get in their new homes. There are so many couples who come calling, promise to fulfil our needs and simply vanish. There are also those from foreign countries who still want to take the children, but are kept back from doing so because Indian families are in the queue.

So, the dreams of Sachin and Satish could take some more time to come true.

2,Economy shifting from farm to manufacturing sector,"CHANDIGARH: If the composition of Haryanaâ€™s Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is any indication, stateâ€™s economy is shifting from agriculture to manufacturing and services sectors.

Haryanaâ€™s Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) at constant (1993-94) prices has recorded a growth of 5.2 per cent, i.e. from Rs 35,062 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 36,876 crore in 2002-03. Saying this, stateâ€™s economic survey (2003-04) points out that at current prices, GSDP is estimated at Rs 65,837 crore in 2002-03 as against Rs 60,212 crore in 2001-02, registering an increase of 9.3 per cent.

The sectoral analysis revealed that in 2002-03, while the contribution of primary sector in GSDP fell marginally by 0.8 per cent, contribution by secondary and tertiary sectors rose by 5.8 per cent and 9.2 per cent, respectively.

The structural composition of the stateâ€™s economy reveals that primary sector, including agriculture, continued to be the dominant sector, despite the fact that its contribution had declined to 29.4 per cent in 2002-03 from 42 per cent in 1993-94. The contribution of secondary and tertiary sectors increased to 28 per cent and 42.6 per cent, respectively, in 2002-03 from 26.2 per cent and 31.3 per cent in 1993-94. This is a good indicator of the growth of stateâ€™s economy.

Manufacturing sector, which occupied the second important place in the stateâ€™s economy after agriculture and allied sectors, witnessed a considerable improvement in its share. Its contribution has increased from 18.7 per cent in 1993-94 to 20.9 per cent in 2002-03, reflecting a healthy sign of industrialisation in the state.

Tertiary sector, a combination of different services like trade, transport, banking, public administration, education, health and the like, also witnessed a significant increase in its share.

The survey points out that the state had been focussing on the development of infrastructure in both urban and rural areas out of its own resources. The revenue deficit has fallen from the peak of Rs 1,540 crore in 1998-99 to Rs 685.11 crore in 2002-03.

In terms of GSDP, the revenue deficit reduced from 3.5 per cent in 1998-99 to 1.04 per cent in 2002-03.

3,"Budget anti-farmer, directionless: Hooda","CHANDIGARH: Leader of the opposition in Haryana assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda has described stateâ€™s proposed budget for 2004-05 as ""antipeople"" and ""directionless"".

Chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, however, emphasised that the new budget was development-oriented.

The budget proposals were presented in the assembly on Thursday by finance minister Sampat Singh, who observed that the focus of the budget was on development of infrastructure.

Chautala said every section of the society would like this budget because no new taxes had been levied and the government would see to it that development continued at a faster pace.

BJP legislature party leader Kishan Pal Gurjar dubbed it as anti-people and anti-farmer and said that his party would make every effort to expose the hollow claims of development of the Chautala government.

4,'Secular' govt draws flak from HC,"PATNA: The state government came in for severe criticism by the Patna high Court on Thursday for discriminating among religious trust boards even as it claims to be ""a secular government"".

Hearing a writ petition filed by office-bearers of the employees'' association of Board of Religious Trust, a single bench presided over by Justice R S Garg directed the finance secretary to file a personal affidavit in the matter.

The finance secretary has to inform the high court whether the Sunni Waqf Board and Shia Waqf Board are getting some money from the state government.

And if yes, why step-motherly treatment has been given to the Hindu trust board. The complaint of the office-bearers was that they had not been getting salaries for past several months.

The judge also directed the state government to file an affidavit stating therein whether it had taken possession of the 33,000 bighas of land belonging to different registered trusts. If yes, under what authority of law has it done so and whether or not compensation for such acquisition has been paid to the Trust Board/the registered trust.

The state was also directed to verify if the land belonging to different registered trust has been acquired under the provisions of the Land Ceiling Act. The judge fixed March 15 as the next date of hearing the matter.

The counsel for the petitioner submitted that some landed property of the registered Board of Religious Trust was taken over by the state government without paying a single paisa to the board, as a result of which the board has been suffering a loss of about Rs 15 lakh per year.

The state government, on the other hand, is making an ex-gratia payment of about Rs 15 lakh to the Sunni Waqf Board and about Rs 8 lakh to Shia Waqf Board, he submitted.

5,"Wedding party waylaid, robbers molest women","KOLKATA: In a near rerun of last year''s Dhantola incident, robbers waylaid a wedding party in North 24-Parganas early on Thursday, snatched all their belongings and allegedly molested the women.

The incident took place at Haroa Ghoshpukur, yards from the Laugachi police outpost, the cops blissfully unaware.

However, they later arrested five persons in daylong raids.

The victims were returning from a wedding in Bhojerhat, South 24-Parganas. The groom, Krishnapada, is the brother of Dinesh Barui, a CPM leader from Malancha village, Minakha. Police said that sometime after midnight, the 11-vehicle convoy was heading towards Minakha. At the Bhangor-Ghusighata crossing, two vehicles broke away from the convoy.

A few minutes later their vehicles screeched to a halt at the sight of tree trunks laid diagonally across the road. Suddenly a group of 16 armed men materialised and surrounded the two vehicles.

Brandishing knives, they dragged out the 17 persons cowering inside and asked them to hand over their belongings.

They snatched away whatever the women wore and misbehaved with them. The victims'' ordeal might have lasted longer had not the other vehicles of the wedding party appeared and beamed their headlights at the robbers.

The other vehicles then returned to Bhangor police station to inform the cops, but not before the robbers had made off with nearly Rs 3,000 and 70 grams of gold ornaments.

The officers at Bhangor and Minakha police stations dashed to the spot but were over an hour late. By then the only people present were the traumatised victims.

Dinesh later lodged an FIR with Haroa police station. North 24-Parganas SP Basudeb Bag justified the late reaction by the police by saying the scene of the crime was on the border of the two 24-Parganas districts. ""Senior officials have arrested five persons. We hope to arrest the other members of the gang and recover the loot,"" said Bag.

Thursday''s incident recalled a similar outrage in Dhantola on February 6 last year where CPM leader Sanat Dhali''s relatives were attacked.

6,State govt employees’ union demands DA hike,"MUMBAI: The state government employeesâ€™ union on Wednesday demanded an increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for the 20 lakh-plus staffers and asked chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to merge 50 per cent of the DA with their basic salary.

The Maharashtra State Gazetted Officers Mahasangh, a representative body of the state employees, demanded that the DA should be increased to 59 per cent from the existing 55 per cent.

At a function held in Mantralaya on Wednesday to mark the 18th anniversary of the Mahasangh, the representatives said the Democratic Front government should emulate the Centre and announce that 50 per cent of the DA would be merged with basic pay.

The annual salary bill of the state employees is over Rs 20,000 crore and another Rs 4,500 crore is spent on payment of pensions. The cash-starved state government is already struggling to repay debts to the tune of Rs 94,000 crore.

The Mahasangh also announced its decision to donate one dayâ€™s salary of the employees (amounting to Rs 5 crore) to the chief ministersâ€™ relief fund in the wake of the worst-ever drought in Maharashtra.

8,State withdraws rioting cases,"MUMBAI: The Democratic Front (DF) government on Friday decided to withdraw cases against 51,442 persons, involved in cases of rioting or street agitations for political or social reasons.

As many as 868 cases which were pending prior to December 2002 against political and social activists across the state would be shortly withdrawn, state home minister R.R. Patil said in Mantralaya.

Observers said the move is yet another attempt by the DF government to win sympathy in the wake of the forthcoming parliamentary elections.

Of the 868 cases to be withdrawn, 24 cases pertain to the macabre riots that rocked the state following the desecration of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkarâ€™s statue at Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in north-east Mumbai in 1998.

Mr Patil has instructed home department officials to call off the cases against those named in these riots.

As many as 20 cases concerning labour agitations have also been ordered to be withdrawn.

10,Rane demands arrest of Deshmukh and Bhujbal,"MUMBAI: Demanding the immediate arrest of former Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and former Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal for their alleged involvement in the multi-crore fake stamp-paper scam, Opposition Leader Narayan Rane on Friday said that DF government should resign owning moral responsibility and seek fresh mandate.

The prime accused Abdul Karim Telgi has reportedly named Deshmukh and Bhujbal during his narco-analysis and brain mapping tests, Rane said and demanded that ""as IPS officers were arrested for their alleged involvement in the scam, these political leaders must be put behind bars.""

Both Deshmukh and Bhujbal have already denied any involvement in the stamp scam.

""Why there is a separate yardstick for police officials and political leaders,"" Rane questioned.

""With both former CM and former DCM were involved in the scam, this DF government do not have any moral right to continue and should resign,"" the opposition leader said.

The former chief minister also lashed out at the ""leading Maharashtra"" campaign of the state government. The government has already withdrawn Rs 25 crore worth publicity blitz.

Entire state is ""feeling horrible"" only those in the government are ""feeling good"", he remarked.

He pooh-poohed Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde''s claim that state would be able to draw electricity from Dabhol Power Company within four months. ""Phase I itself would take at least nine months to start, while it would take 16 months to start both phases of 2,148 MW project,"" he claimed.

11,Hindu College principal faces no-confidence motion,"NEW DELHI: Teachers at Hindu College have passed a no-confidence resolution against the college principal, Kavita Sharma. Members of the college staff association say that the college has had an unfair attitude towards the re-appointment of teachers, which has â€˜â€˜demoralisedâ€™â€™ them.

â€˜â€˜It is true that the staff association has passed a no-confidence resolution. But we are hoping to solve the issue with college authorities in an amiable manner,â€™â€™ said Hindu staff association president SB Singh.

The main cause of conflict is the re-appointment of college teachers after they reach retirement age. According to University rules, colleges can recommend names of â€˜â€˜distinguishedâ€™â€™ teachers for re-appointment. Along with names of the chosen teachers, authorities are also required to assess whether or not a teacher has rendered â€˜â€˜distinguished academic servicesâ€™â€™. The college then sends a recommendation requesting the university to re-appoint the specified teacher whether his/her services are considered valuable to the institution.

According to Hindu teachers, the principal has been only sending names to the university without the necessary recommendation from the college.

â€˜â€˜There is resentment among teachers over the issue and we have now passed a resolution of no-confidence to put moral pressure on the principal. The next step would be to discuss the matter with the governing body chairman,â€™â€™ said one staff association member.

While the principal said she would not like to comment on the issue, college authorities say the teachersâ€™ move is unjustified.

â€˜â€˜According to rules, re-appointment applies only to distinguished teachers. However, every one wants to continue in service. The college canâ€™t recommend every teacherâ€™s name,â€™â€™ said one official.

12,CBI chargesheet politically motivated: Soren,"RANCHI: The JMM supremo Sibu Soren on Friday said the CBI chargesheet against him was politically motivated by the BJP-led NDA government as its effort to include the JMM in its alliance had failed.

""The BJP has tried to force me to join the NDA but I withstood it. When I won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat with an overwhelming margin the BJP got unnerved. It has no candidate to put up against me, so this is the tactics it has employed"", Soren told a press conference here.

Soren, who had been chargesheeted on Thursday by the CBI in a disproportionate case, said he would not be cowed down by such ''tactics''.

""The Delhi High Court has quashed all the allegations against me and I have full faith in the judiciary. This time also I will come clear"", he said. The JMM leader claimed he had told the investigating agency that the funds in his account were from the donations the party received from the poor during the 35 years of statehood struggle.

""I am being harassed, just because I am a poor tribal"", he said, claiming the CBI had approached the Lok Sabha Speaker a dozen times for action against him, despite being clearly told that it was not within his (Speaker''s) jurisdiction.

""They waited this long to use it just before the elections"", Soren alleged.

However to a question whether this meant slamming doors on BJP for a poll tie-up with it, Soren significantly said ""my doors are always open. Anybody can come anytime for talks, for there is no permanent friend or foe in politics"".
