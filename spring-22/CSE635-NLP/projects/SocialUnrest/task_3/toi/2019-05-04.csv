1,Mulayam lambasts Mayawati govt,"SAHARSA: Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav has welcomed the Supreme Court verdict making it compulsory for a candidate to declare details of his criminal record before filing his nomination papers but has expressed reservations about the credibility of police records in this regard.

While talking to newsmen here before leaving for Madhepura, Yadav said that Samajwadi Party had taken the initiative to curb criminalisation of politics in the country and the Supreme Court has only vindicated his party''s stand. The only new thing that the SC has added is that the candidates will have to declare their assets too, which he supported whole-heartedly.

Mulayam Singh Yadav, who reached here by a special plane from Lucknow to attend the marriage of his party worker''s sister at Madhepura, claimed that a political worker could not be branded a criminal only because his name figured in police record. The ultimate decision has to be given by the people''s court.

The Samajwadi Party chief dubbed the BSP-BJP coalition government in UP as an opportunistic alliance devoid of any political ethics, and said that cracks would surface soon as not less than two dozen alleged mafia dons, who have been elected, would start demanding their pound of flesh in the government. The most damaging part of this coalition government is that the credibility of politicians had suffered immensely in the eyes of the electorate.

Although he supported his party general secretary Amar Singh''s allegations that the Congress alone was responsible for the formation of the BSP-BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam vowed to expose all those responsible for this unholy alliance. Their only aim was to keep the Samajwadi Party away from power as it was the lone party they were afraid of in Delhi.

Referring to the BJP government''s support to the opposition-sponsored motion on Gujarat riots in the Rajya Sabha, Mulayam Singh Yadav said it was merely a face-saving device for the government as it knew well that the opposition was in majority there. He castigated Prime Minister Vajpayee for his silence on the removal of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and said the Prime Minister had sent a wrong message to the country that the protection of a state government was more important for him than the country itself.

2,Govt yet to make rules on plastic bags,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state government has banned the manufacture and use of coloured plastic bags, without even formulating the rules to prosecute defaulters.

So when the state environment department recently found 20 factories manufacturing the banned bags, it had little clue on what action to take.

It has been six months since the state government banned the manufacture and use of coloured plastic bags, thinner than 20 microns, under its much-publicised Delhi Plastic Bags (Manufacture, Sale and Usage) and Non-Bio-Degradable Garbage (Control) Act.

However, due to an absence of rules on enforcement and prosecution, the environment department is yet to act on the ban. Environment minister Deep Chand Bandhu said the rules for the Act have been formulated, but require lt-governor Vijai Kapoorâ€™s assent.

""Action will be taken against the defaulters after the rules for prosecution are notified. The complete ban on plastic bags would come into force as soon as the L-G gives his approval,"" he said.

While the environment department has to notify the rules, the prosecution and fine for going against the ban has been stipulated in the Plastic Act.

Any person violating the Act is liable to imprisonment, from three months to one year, or a fine of Rs 25,000.

Besides the ban, the Plastic Act also makes segregation of non-biodegradable waste mandatory for all Delhiites and civic agencies.

The Act also has a provision for punitive action on individuals who are caught throwing garbage and polybags in public places.

Bandhu said the officials responsible for enforcing the ban have been identified. The state government has entrusted the task to sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs).

The raiding teams would be led by SDMs and accompanied by the police. According to the Act, civic bodies would be responsible for ensuring segregation of waste.

Bandhu said the Delhi municipal corporation (MCD), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Delhi Cantonment Board (DCB) are also waiting for the government rules.

The Act also says that the MCD, NDMC, DCB and public works department (PWD) would be responsible for enforcing the ban on littering.

The Act gives powers to assistant engineers to impose fines. Each agency will be responsible for enforcing the ban in areas under its jurisdiction. The PWD would be responsible for manning its roads and open drains.

3,Court commissioner to check land rules violation,"MUMBAI:The co-operative court has appointed a court commissioner to inspect the alleged violation of development control rules by some members of New Sagar Darshan Cooperative Housing Society on Bhulabhai Desai Road.

The dispute, taken to court by Ardesher Mehta and a few other members of the society against another member, Rajnikant Choksi and six others, alleges conversion of a garden into a car park, giving out garage space for shops and plans to put up an unauthorised hoarding in the compound.

On April 5, the judge, Mr A B Nargude, appointed advocate, S M Nadgauda, as court commissioner and directed him to inspect the premises and take photographs to ascertain the truth.

The inspection took place on April 21 and the court commissioner is expected to submit the report by May 6.

Mr Mehta, who is the chairperson of the society, alleges in his suit that the garden at the entrance of the two buildings of the society was demolished and converted into a car park.

This amounted to a violation of mandatory provisions made under the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act 1888 for providing playgrounds and gardens.

The opponents have claimed that there was no garden. In their reply, they have claimed there was only a tree, which was cut after taking the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporationâ€™s permission and the approval of the societyâ€™s general body.

The suit has further alleged that five garages in the buildings have been converted into shops in gross violation of FSI and development control rules.

In response to this, the opponents have said that only two of the garages have been converted in this manner and this was done many years ago.

4,"Vikas, Vishal seek time to engage lawyers","GHAZIABAD: Vikas and Vishal Yadav, accused of abducting and killing Nitish Katara, on Friday sought time to engage lawyers to defend them during the framing of charges.

The case came up before Ghaziabad district judge R P Mishra, who adjourned the hearing to May 17.

6,To say ‘go and die’ is not abetment to suicide: SC,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday quashed the chargesheet against the brother-in-law of a person who committed suicide on being told by him to â€˜â€˜go and dieâ€™â€™ and was thus charged with abetment to suicide. The deceased, who was known to be a drunkard, had committed suicide after two days of the prick when he had gone to get back his estranged wife.

â€˜â€˜To say â€˜Go and dieâ€™ itself does not constitute the ingredient of instigationâ€™â€™, the court said, adding â€˜â€˜it is common knowledge that the words uttered in a quarrel or on a spur of moment cannot be taken to be uttered with mens rea (motive)â€™â€™.

A Bench comprising Justice M B Shah and Justice H K Sema said, â€˜â€˜Such words are uttered in a fit of anger and emotionâ€™â€™.

Taking note of the statement by the deceasedâ€™s wife that he was jobless, quarrelsome and always in a drunken state, the Bench said, â€˜â€˜It is a common knowledge that excessive drinking leads one to debauchery.

It clearly appeared, therefore, that the deceased was a victim of his own conduct unconnected with the quarrel that had ensued on July 25, 1998, when the petitioner is stated to have used abusive languageâ€™â€™.

10,Meet throws light on suicides,"BANGALORE: India is one of the few countries in the world where suicide is considered a criminal offence. While in India, the home and police departments handle cases and statistics of suicides, in other countries the numbers are collated by the health and welfare department.

A WHO-sponsored workshop on `Suicide Prevention and Capacity-building Strategies for Police Personnel'' was organised by Nimhans on Friday. The workshop presented two books by Dr G. Gururaj, department of epidemiology, and Dr Mohan K. Isaac, department of psychiatry, Nimhans. The facts and figures presented about Bangalore in the two reports convey the trend of suicides.

A total of 3,718 suicides were reported between January 1996 and December 1998 with an increase of 150 per cent from 1996-97 to 133 per cent from 1997-98. During 1999, 1,938 suicides had been reported as per official reports.

South Bangalore recorded a high of 27.5 per cent while Central Bangalore recorded the lowest of 7 per cent in the distribution of suicides across Bangalore city.

Dr Gururaj said one-third of the people contemplating suicides give clues about the act. He surmised that lack of coping skills and social support systems is the main reason for people to commit suicide.

The reasons for high rate of suicides in some areas could be ascribed to presence of high slum population, lower socio-economic status, economic deprivation, migrated population, increased alcohol and crime rates and large families. Areas with low suicide rates were mainly central business areas of the city, with less residential population.

In Bangalore, the percentage of suicides in different age groups is as follows: Below 15 years (2.6 per cent), 15-29 years (53.1 per cent), 30-49 years (34.5 per cent), 50-59 years (5.6 per cent) and 60 plus (3.5 per cent).

Dr Isaac said it was important to give attention to survivors of suicide attempts and the victims who were the cause for the act. He maintained that while ``suicidal ideation is present in all of us, the ambivalent thought of wanting to commit suicide can be prevented if one is willing to give a patient listening to the person under pressure''''.

Hema Deshpande, coordinator of Vanitha Sahaya Vani, said 10 per cent of the attempted cases of suicide they receive on the helpline are due to dowry harassment. ``The husband refuses to accept the wife once he becomes aware that she has attempted suicide. So we are confused whether to divulge the information at all,'''' she said.

Usha, a volunteer from the senior citizen helpline, said they get distress calls from elders and need to be equipped with strategies to handle suicide prevention.

Policemen at the meet expressed the need for a suicide prevention cell, list of counsellors who can handle calls from those wanting to commit suicide and skills in moral counselling.

The workshop was attended by Police Commissioner H.T. Sangliana, DCP (Crime) Ravindra Prasad, Joint Commissioner J.P. Mirji and Dr Joga Rao, consultant, Pegasus Health Consultants.

11,Trade unions to protest on May 15,"AHMEDABAD: Communist party of India MP Gurudas Dasgupta has said there was a wide gap between the ''promise and practice'' by the Narendra Modi government on relief and rehabilitation for the riot affected.

""Mr Modi has his own way of doing things. He is the prime minister of Gujarat,"" said Dasgupta addressing reporters. ""Modi is defying the PM in a sweet and covert manner.""

He demanded Modi''s trial before a court of law for failing to discharge his constitutional obligations as a chief minister.

Holding Modi directly responsible for the slow pace of rehabilitation, he said Modi was outside the ''orbit of the prime minister''s influence''. Dasgupta, who is also general secretary of All India Trade Union Congress, was in the city on a day''s visit as a trade union representative to assess the situation at relief camps.

He said the trade unions all over the country would protest against the ''genocide in Gujarat'' on May 15, while the day would be observed as ''National Harmony Day'' in the state.

He said there were serious attempts on the state government''s part to withdraw relief by reducing quantity of ration supplied to victims drastically. The Rs 150-crore rehabilitation package announced by the prime minister was grossly ""inadequate"" and just ""a drop in the ocean"", he added.

""Allocation has been done without making proper assessment of damage to property and life,"" he said demanding a Rs 1,000-crore relief and rehabilitation package for the riot victims.

12,Violent protests stall eviction drive in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: An eviction drive to clear railway property at Lake Gardens here was called off on Friday following violent protests by shanty dwellers who set ablaze four vehicles and a number of huts even as Trinamool Congress activists put up several road blockades in the city demanding their rehabilitation.

The drive, at the request of the Eastern Railway to clear railway property here, was put off temporarily as it was feared that it could have led to a ""serious law and order problem,"" a city police official said.

The trouble started early in the day as a large posse of policemen backed by the Rapid Action Force arrived at the site to demolish shanties along the railway track.

At least four vehicles, including a bus, were torched and a number of huts gutted by the angry shanty dwellers, police said.

Tension was building up in the area since Thursday night. Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee after arriving from Delhi drove straight to the site and sat on a dharna demanding rehabilitation of the people before the eviction drive began.

TC activists led by senior leaders also set up blockades at different places in the metropolis throwing traffic out of gear. The protestors, who held up road and rail traffic in the area, hurled bombs and brickbats at the police causing minor injuries to two people.

However, there was no damage to railway property.

Earlier, the Calcutta High Court had ordered eviction of illegal settlers on railway property before April 30.

Mamata Banerjee, addressing a meeting at Lake Gardens, said that her party has challenged the high court order on the eviction in Supreme Court.

She offered to contribute from her MP fund towards rehabilitation of the shanty dwellers if the West Bengal government had a shortage of funds.

The former railway minister said, in the past she had faced court cases for evictions, ""but I had arranged for the rehabilitation of the affected before undertaking such eviction.""

Banerjee said she had talked with Railway Minister Nitish Kumar on the issue.

Peak hour traffic at Moulali crossing in central Kolkata came to a halt as Trinamool Congress protestors led by MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay shouted slogans and staged a massive road blockade.

15,Rise above party lines for country's progress: PM,"GWALIOR: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday night appealed to all political parties to work unitedly for the security and development of the nation.

Addressing a public meeting after unveiling a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj atop a horse Vajpayee said unity among political parties was the need of the hour.

He said in a democracy real power rested with the people, who ultimately took all the decisions.

But he cautioned that care should be taken to ensure that democracy does not degenerate into a mobocracy.

The Prime Minister recalled that Shivaji had never discriminated between Hindus and Muslims and treated all communities as equal.

Vajpayee said a king cannot and should not distinguish between Hindus and Muslims and must work for ensuring the protection of all sections of society.

He said Shivaji had followed Raj Dharam and pointed out that the late ruler''s ideals and principles continued to be relevant even today.

The Prime Minister said Shivaji had fought against the rulers in Delhi in his time and had not only established the rule of Hindus but also given prestige to India''s name. PTI

16,Award for outstanding tobacco farmers,"MYSORE: Karnataka Agriculture Minister T.B. Jayachandra will present Tobacco Farmers'' Award at Tobacco Institute Research Station in Hunsur on Sunday. District Ministers H. Vishwanath and M. Shivanna will also participate.

The award instituted by the Tobacco Institute of India, is given to farmers who perform outstandingly in the cultivation of flue-cured Virginia Tobacco. It carries a cash award of Rs 10,000, a silver plaque and a shawl.

Amit Sarkar, the director of the institute, said the award was to encourage tobacco farmers to improve productivity and adopt progressive agro-practices.

A panel of judges from key organisations and government agencies associated with tobacco cultivation, including the Tobacco Board and Tobacco Institute, have selected the winners of the award.

He said the farmers were shortlisted on the basis of the practices adopted by them. Fuel efficiency, use of approved pesticides and yield per acre, were among the factors taken into account.

Sarkar said the award was important because the state had 50,000 acres of rain-fed land where about 40,000 farmers cultivated premium quality tobacco.

They are generating Rs 300 crore in terms of excise duty.

The ""Mysore Style"" flue cured Virginia Tobacco was exported to Algeria, Belgium, Germany, Russia, Singapore and UK, Ukraine, Bangladesh, Nepal, Egypt and other countries.

17,Cong rally bays for Modi's blood,"BELLARY: The District Congress Committee (DCC) on Saturday demanded that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi be dismissed immediately.

The rally, led by DCC president Siraj Sheikh, began from Durgamma Temple and went round the busy Double Road and Royal Circle before culminating at the Deputy Commissioner''s office.

The rally had some party stalwarts like former Rajya Sabha member K.C. Kondaiah, MP Kolur Basavana Goud, legislators M. Shankar Reddy (Siruguppa), Bhagirathi Maralu Siddana Gowda (Kottur), Nandihalli Halappa (Hadagali), Legislative Council member K. Niranjan Naidu, Zilla Panchayat president Sanna Hanumakka, her deputy K.S.L. Swamy, former ZP chairman Venkatrao Ghorpade, District Youth Congress president B. Ramprasad, and zilla and taluk panchayat members.

The memorandum, addressed to President K.R. Narayanan, stated that the situation prevailing in Gujarat is serving to refresh memories of the bloody days of Partition, and reopen old wounds.

The carnage had tarnished the secular image of India in the international community. ""Are we prepared to allow communal fascism to govern this vast and socially pluralistic, culturally diverse, secular and democratic society?"" the memorandum questioned.

The leaders warned that the ""powerful communal bomb"" exploding in Gujarat would take its toll. Indiscriminate killings and violence directed against a particular community, with the apparent complicity of government machinery, is haunting Indian society and polity, they said.

Blaming the Centre for inaction, they said the government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party has failed to perform its duty. The Narendra Modi government had utterly failed to control the violence and mass killings.

Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee is refusing to remove Narendra Modi or restore peace constitutionally, instead he is trying to defend the indefensible, they deplored.

Under these circumstances, they demanded that the President take a firm stand on Gujarat, and impose Central rule immediately. This will restore confidence in the minds of the minorities. Headquarters Assistant P. Achchanna received the memorandum.

District Congress Committee president Siraj Shaikh submits a memorandum to P. Acchanna, headquarters assistant, demanding that President K.R. Naryanan dismiss the Narendra Modi government. K. Niranjan Naidu, MLC; former RS member K.C. Kondaiah, MP Kolur Basavana Goud, M. Shankar Reddy, Siruguppa legislator, and others look on.

18,Farmers' body flays govt's approach,"KOCHI: The Indian Farmers'' Movement on Saturday alleged that the United Democratic Front government''s approach towards the agriculture sector, after coming to power in Kerala, was disappointing.

Addressing a press meet here, Dr M C George, Infarm national trustee and publicity convener, said the UDF government had violated several promises given to the farmers in the election manifesto including a fair price for all their products. The government, instead of implementing the assurances, had increased the misery of the farmers by imposing new taxes and hiking the bus and electricity charges.

The prices of arecanut, coffee and pepper had fallen steeply and though government had announced various measures to help the farmers, it had not really ""helped"" them.

The Centre had kept its promise of paying subsidy for the rubber exports done by Infarm, he said, and alleged that the state government had not paid the subsidy amounting to Rs 56 lakh.

To expose the state government''s anti-farmer policies, Infarm had decided to organise an awareness campaign and public meetings in all panchayats from May 6 to 14 and on the next day it would hold dharnas in front of all sub-registrar offices, he said.
