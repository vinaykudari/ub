0,Rly minister lands at station for a surprise check,"NEW DELHI: A beam ready to fall over passengers, a missing portion of the roof of a platform, broken taps, old stocks of bottled water, a dirty track, delinquent workers and much more.

The scene presented a living nightmare. At the Old Delhi railway station, minister of state for railways A K Moorthy on Thursday had a taste of what ordinary passengers encounter every day. Moorthy was on a surprise visit to the railway station to monitor the facilities during the â€˜â€˜passenger comfort yearâ€™â€™.

As if the state of the railway station was not enough, bottles of the Railwaysâ€™ prestigious packaged drinking water, Rail Neer, were found with damaged seals. Cartons of old stock of the drinking water were also seized by the ministry staff. It seems the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation has failed to monitor the sales of its product even in the few stations it has chosen to sell Rail Neer.

1,NCP leaders sacked for anti-party moves,"MUMBAI: Acting on a complaint from the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has sacked president of its Solapur district unit Shankar Patil and 25 other activists for anti-party activities.

NCP spokesperson Vasant Chavan stated here on Thursday that Patil was sacked for supporting the BJP candidate Pratapsinh Mohite Patil who is contesting the Lok Sabha by-election from Solapur constituency scheduled for Friday.

Dairy development minister Anandrao Deokate of the Congress is pitted against Mohite Patil. The poll was necessitated by the resignation of Sushilkumar Shinde following his appointment as chief minister by the Congress high command. The election is being projected by the opposition BJP-Sena combine as referendum on the performance of the Democratic Front government led by Shinde. Significantly, the BJP nominee is the brother of NCP minister Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil.

Chavan said NCP president Sharad Pawar had asked three NCP ministers from Solapur, Vijaysinh Mohite Patil, Dilip Sopal and Laxman Dhoble and entire party unit in the district to work for the Congress candidate. Since Shankar Patil and 25 others defied the directive they were sacked.

2,Presidential govt only solution: Nayar,"LUDHIANA: Advocating the presidential form of government, noted journalist and former MP Kuldip Nayar on Wednesday asserted that it was the only way out of the present mess the country was in.

He made a fervent appeal to give the idea a chance to test its effectiveness in stemming the rot set across the political spectrum.

Nayar made these remarks while addressing members of the Ludhiana Management Association on the theme â€˜India of my dreamsâ€™ on Wednesday. The idea, if worked, could effectively rid the country of vote bank politics and the resultant appeasement of self-centric regional political leaders seeking their pound of flesh due to compulsions thrown up by the coalition politics, he said.

Stating that the present day scenario in the country was not what people of his generation had dreamt of, he elaborated on how the coalition government had to compromise on principles to stay afloat for the five-year tenure. Similar situation was prevailing at the state level too, he said, substantiating his observation by citing examples of the chief ministers doling out largesse to the MLAs to keep their chairs secure.

He alleged that such compulsions led to criminals becoming MLAs and MPs. Even though the idea was fraught with danger of the person at the helm of affairs misusing his position in the proposed setup, but this idea should be given a chance, he said.

A strong votary of friendly relations with Pakistan, Nayar saw no hope of any lasting improvement in the relation between both the countries till military regime continued.

Speaking about his experience after visiting Pakistan a number of times, he said the people on both sides of the border were keen to establish good relations. He also advocated formation of South Asian union on the lines of European Union for peace and development in South Asian region.

About 300 industrialists, entrepreneurs, management professionals and academicians attended the meeting.

3,RBI’s 'clean note' policy meets with unclean habits,"PUNE: What is the status of the ''clean note'' policy launched by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) four years ago? A September 6 advertisement put out in a daily by the apex bank bares it all. The ad goes: Aplyala kalpana aahe ka? (Do you know) that the RBI has directed all banks not to staple notes and use paper bands, rubber bands or threats to bundle them.

Four years down the line, the message is yet to percolate down to most banks. Six out 10 surveyed have either not implemented the directive, or have implemented it partially. Others have given up on it after finding it ""not feasible"" in their day-to-day business. The reasons are varied: Some banks say implementing the policy is expensive; others say keeping currency notes clean in the Indian setting is a lengthy process.

M.G. Uruskar, deputy general manager, Cosmos Bank, which claims to have implemented the policy in only 50 per cent of its branches, said unless the mindset of people is changed, the policy could not be implemented in total. People are still to come to grips with the new system â€” so are banks. A stapled bundle of Rs-100 notes is still a symbol of reliability, Uruskar said.

Also, the cost of speedy cash disposal in high-transaction banks is quite high: while a money-counting machine costs approximately Rs 50,000, a currency binding machine costs Rs 30,000.

The manager at Baramati co-operative bank''s Paud road branch said co-operative banks were economically too weak to sustain the burden of installing counting and binding machines. The bank, which has nearly 15 branches, is trying its level-best to adhere to the RBI policy and claims to have implemented it at its main branches, albeit with mixed success. Calling for a revision of the policy, he suggested, ""Instead, the apex bank should make the use of machines to detect fake notes mandatory."" P.G. Kamath, assistant general manager, Saraswat Bank, also blamed the partial success of the system on the ""Indian mindset"". The bank, which claims to have implemented the policy in 70 per cent of its 78 branches, initially faced opposition from the employees'' union as well as customers. ""Now, however, people have begun taking the system in their stride,"" Kamath said.

A.N. Magadum, a senior manager with the Canara Bank, which again claims to have implemented the policy in toto, was also not fully satisfied with the policy. ""It is necessary in urban areas where we have ATMs galore (ATMs do not accept mutilated notes), but why unnecessarily penalise the rural folk,"" he said, adding that the new system was time-consuming. Adds Magadum: ""Another problem is that counting machines cannot detect fake notes. They even count a piece of paper of a note''s size as genuine currency. After all, machines cannot match humans!""

Prabhakar Gaikwad, a chief manager with the State Bank of India, however, begged to differ. ""We have placed our note-counting machines in such a way that both the cashier and the customer are able to keep an eye on their functioning. We have also installed small, economical machines (costing around Rs 20,000), which make the job easier.""

A.W. Sheikh, manager at the Development Credit bank, off Apte road, recalled that the problems with the system were similar to those encountered when cheques were introduced. The only problem with the new system is that they cannot be counted without tearing the paper flap. The IDBI''s retail banking head (Pune region), Shridhar Iyer, too, blamed the delay in implementation of the system on the mentality of sticking to the familiar. The policy also poses problems at the time of bulk remittance, he said. ""It''s different abroad, where most transactions take place through credit cards.

This is India where, even today, houses are brought cash,"" he remarked. But the RBI isn''t ready buy any of these ""excuses"". Said a senior officer with the bank''s department of currency management in Mumbai: ""There will be no repeal of the policy."" Asked about the problems faced by banks, particularly the ones in the co-operative sector, he said the apex bank had not received any complaints in writing. ""If we receive any complaint, we will definitely redress it,"" he said. But isn''t it the RBI''s duty to volunteer and understand the problems of smaller banks? A question to which the RBI officer did not have an answer.

4,Experts to discuss increase in diabetics,"LUCKNOW: Experts hold that out of every ten diabetes patients across the world, one is an Indian. They project that by 2025, there will be an Indian among every five diabetes patient in the world.

In this context, the Uttar Pradesh Diabetes Association (UPDA) is holding its annual conference (UPDACON 2003) on September 27 and 28 to promote diabetes awareness.

Doctors say that diabetes is of two kinds: Type 1 is the rarer one which can be cured only with insulin and type 2 is the more common one which occurs due to environmental factors, besides genetic susceptibility.

â€œWhile just 5 per cent suffer from type 1 which causes immediate harm, a vast number suffering from the asymptomatic or type 2 diabetes are not even aware of their ailment and discover it accidentally.

Delving on the causes of diabetes, Lt-Col MK Garg, endocrinologist in Command Hospital said that obesity was a predominant reason for diabetes as it lead to insulin resistance in cells. Once the body develops this resistance, the glucose level rises, he added.

The increased glucose which should be transferred to the cells from the blood remains unused as its carrier, the insulin is deficit. He pointed out that fatigue and high urination were among other symptoms of diabetes.

6,"SC issues notices to govt, VKSU VC","SASARAM: After hearing the special leave petition of former principal of Gram Bharati College at Ramgarh of Kaimur district Dharm Raj Singh, whose appointment as principal was quashed by the Patna High Court in July, the Supreme Court recently issued notices to the state government, vice chancellor of VKS university, Ara, and College Service Commission, Bihar.

The HC had quashed the appointment of Dharm Raj Singh as the principal on the ground that he did not have the requisite qualification to be appointed as principal.

Against the order of the HC, the aggrieved principal filed a special leave petition in the SC claiming that the quashing of his appointment by the HC was against the decision of SC, which on October 12, 2001 had made it clear that the service of the teaching and non-teaching staff of the colleges of the state shall not be disturbed when matters are being probed into.

The SC had directed an inquiry be held by retired SC judge S C Agarwal into the appointments of all the teaching and non-teaching staff of newly constituted colleges of the state.

Dharm Raj Singh, in his petition, also claimed that the inquiry by the former justice is yet to be completed, but the HC quashed his appointment despite the instruction of the SC.

7,Bengal unveils new IT policy,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government on Friday announced an updated IT policy with an emphasis on easing the procedural hurdles in the way of investments to achieve its aim of helping the state garner 15 per cent of the country''s total IT revenues by the end of the decade.

The ''Information Technology Policy, 2003'' - which comes three years after the state first announced an IT policy - grants all IT companies the status of ''public utility service'' providers so that they were not subject to a maze of labour legislations that could come in the way of faster operations, and also not fall a victim to wildcat strikes and bandhs.

""In IT where human resource inputs are highly flexible and mobile, the government recognizes the need to simplify procedural framework under the existing labour laws. Accordingly, the government is committed to move from a regulated administration framework to a promotional framework to facilitate smooth functioning of the business,"" the policy said.

""It is the first time that IT companies have been given the status of public utility service providers by any state,"" West Bengal IT minister Manab Mukherjee said.

The updated policy - declared by West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the CII national council meeting at Kolkata - also removes a major irritant for IT companies operating in the state by allowing self-certification in various cases.

Infotech firms would henceforth be allowed to use the new self-certification norms with regard to the Payment of Wages Act, Minimum Wages Act, Contract Labour (Regulations & Abolition) Act and Employees State Insurance Act, among others.

The new policy - which Mukherjee described as a ""living policy"" that would constantly be evaluated and revised keeping in mind the changing business environment - moreover provides for the creation of a high-powered committee of government secretaries headed by the chief secretary to speed up the process of clearances.

Issues that cannot be solved at the level of the secretaries would be forwarded to the state''s cabinet committee on IT.

The state IT secretary would personally supervise investments of over Rs 5 crore.

From the fiscal incentives point of view, the new policy states that IT companies would be eligible for one-time benefits in terms of exemption from consumption tax and exemption on expenditure incurred on acquiring specified quality standards.

For mega projects that require investments exceeding Rs 25 crore and employ over 750 people in the first year of operation, the government would consider a special package of incentives on a case-by-case basis.

""Specifically, for companies with plans to set up large centres, the state may consider a graded incentive package that would increase the incentives offered per employee with an increase in the planned size for the centre,"" it said.

""IT has remained largely urban-centric. We would like to take this to the villages and gram panchayats in a big way,"" Mukherjee said, while outlining his vision of using the new policy to network the whole government apparatus.

8,Kalam urges CEOs to play pivotal role in development,"KOCHI: President A P J Abdul Kalam on Friday made an impassioned plea to Indian entrepreneurs - both in the country and abroad - to share their knowledge and expertise to help start a ""well synchronised"" economic revolution and make India a developed nation.

""The global Indian family of talented entrepreneurs should participate in this movement towards a developed India by using their knowledge and experience,"" Kalam said addressing over 100 CEOs, gathered here to discuss ways to transform India into an ""economically secure and spiritually strong country"".

Pointing out that nearly 26 per cent of the 260 million people were below the poverty line, he said steps should be taken to double the GDP from the present 4.5 per cent.

""The fundamental sectoral contributions to GDP of different countries should be studied to understand how advanced countries had transformed themselves into an ''era of prosperity and strength''.

""The key to rapid growth lies in empowering the rural society with knowledge,"" Kalam said, adding agriculture and food processing, education and health care have been identified as the thrust areas.

He said steps should be taken to develop all the 580,000 villages which missed out on both industrial and IT revolution.

Pointing out that India lacked transparency in governance, he said, ""as India moves towards being a developed nation and economic superpower with an empowered management,"" there is a need to have ""spiritual connectivity"" besides leaders with high morale.

Kalam said that our economic growth strategy should focus on enhancing wealth generation from the services sector.

""By 2020, the contribution of the service sector should be 64 per cent of the GDP while agriculture sector should also increase its share in the total GDP from the present 25 per cent,"" he said.

On river networking challenges, he said the population not having access to safe water would increase over the next two decade from one billion to two billion and nearly five billion people will be affected in the next two decades.
