0,Lives lost as laws flouted,"CHANDIGARH: Thirteen-year-old Vikas might have lived had enforcement agencies been serious about implementing the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act regarding the seating configuration applicable to auto-rickshaws.

But the class VIII student died a tragic death on Thursday because auto-rickshaw drivers continue to flout rules unabashedly, never mind if precious lives are endangered in the process.

All things considered, it is for the UT administration to take strict action against these violators, failing which such recurrences cannot be ruled out. Going by what is officially permitted, auto-rickshaws cannot carry more than four passengers, including the driver.

However, the manner in which this provision is being implemented is for all to see on the city roads. Sadly, the worst affected in this case are school students whose personal safety is at stake, all for a few extra bucks. In fact, the auto in which Vikas was travelling to school on Thursday morning was ferrying eight students, twice the number permitted. State Transport Authority (STA) officials admitted that a large number of autos and school buses that ferry schoolchildren violate norms.

An official said, â€˜â€˜We have been challaning and even impounding autos and buses on a regular basis for flouting rules. But the fact is that we have our own constraints in terms of manpower. Traffic police personnel, who are present in every nook and corner of the city, need to become proactive to clamp down on these violators.â€� Under the Motor Vehicles Act, both the STA and traffic police were the enforcement agencies for implementing rules.

Several parents of schoolchildren, who Times News Network spoke to, said it was about time for the official machinery to wake up to hard reality before more lives were sacrificed on the altar of official inaction and inefficiency. â€˜â€˜The administration has to take responsibility,â€� a parent said.

2,Report on minister's tantrums soon,"BHAGALPUR: Bhagalpur district magistrate and superintendent of police would submit a joint report on state minister Rama Devi and her armed supporters, who were detained on Wednesday evening for forcibly occupying a room in the Bhagalpur circuit house, to the state government.

According to official sources, two rooms of the circuit house were reserved for Justice Chandramauli Prasad and Justice Nagendra Rai and the district administration handed over those rooms to the local judicial authorities concerned so that they could arrange the room as per the need.

While Justice Prasad had already checked-in, Justice Rai was supposed to come on Friday. Sources said that Rama Devi and her supporters, who were coming from Sultanganj, arrived at the circuit house, on Wednesday evening. The officials of the circuit house said that though she was allotted a room, she did not find it fit and started yelling ""Mera kamra ganda hai, kya is jile ke collector ko pata nahin hai ki hum sarkar hain.""

Eyewitnesses said that the minister''s supporters roughed up the circuit house staff and intruded in the room reserved for Justice Rai. ""The minister''s supporters rebuked and thrashed us,"" said an employee of the local circuit house.

The DM, who was standing near the minister that time along with the SP, told the minister that she should not forget that her men have committed an offence and for that they have to face stern actions.

Later, he asked the SP to detain all armed supporters there, said a circuit house staff, preferring anonymity.

Some RJD men, who were present there, told TNN that the minister talked with the RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav.

""But, instead of sympathising with the minister, Lalooji scolded her and asked her to return Patna as soon as possible,"" said an RJD supporter.

Meanwhile, DM KP Ramaiah and SP R Sankaran told TNN on Thursday that they would send a joint report to the state government about the whole incident.

According to them, the situation was under control.

3,Public calls will pinch the purse,"KOLKATA: Brace up to pay twice the amount for making calls from public telephone booths from Saturday as the pulse for local calls is being brought down to 90 seconds from 180 seconds.

If that is harsh on your pocket, there is relief for making calls to cellular phones from PCOs as these calls too will have a pulse of 90 seconds. Following this pulse rate revamp by CalTel, callers get 30 per cent more talk-time when making calls to cellphones from PCOs than from homes. However, when making calls to land lines, domestic phones offer 100 per cent more talk-time than PCOs.

â€œItâ€™s great news for us. Weâ€™ve really been losing money ever since STD charges were slashed. Calcutta Telephoneâ€™s delay in resuming PCO-to-cell services was another blow. The rationalised pulse rate will help recover some of the losses,â€� central Kolkata PCO owner Jogesh Roy said. Roy is one of the few who are aware of the impending changes. A vast majority of the 20,000-odd PCOs in the CalTel circle remain ignorant. That could lead to a lot of confusion, especially because the display units and printers at the PCO-end will register the revamped rates from Saturday.

â€œWe have begun informing the PCO owners, by either a direct call or through interactive voice response service. We will issue an advertisement in newspapers on February 21, the switchover date,â€� CalTel general manager (customer service) S.K. Bhaduri said. Admitting that the problem of switching from a uniform three-minute pusle to multi-pulse system had foxed technicians, the official said the issue had been sorted out Earlier, calls from PCOs to landlines and WLL services had a pulse of 180 seconds. Before withdrawing the service to call cellular customers, even these calls had a pulse of 180 seconds. The service was withdrawn following a TRAI ruling which stated that calls from landlines to cell phones would have a pulse of 60 seconds.

4,AISA to show black flags to HRD minister,"PATNA: The All India Students'' Association (AISA) will show black flags to Union minister for human resources development, Murli Manohar Joshi, as a mark of protest for his decision to make a ''Model Act'' in an attempt to privatise education and educational institutes in the country.

The ''Model Act'' would make colleges and universities to rely less on government aid and more on establishing relationships with NGOs, private companies and foreign funding agencies for generating financial resource, AISA leaders said in Patna on Thursday.

AISA said that Joshi was trying to privatise the entire education system and added that with the new Act, only haves would enjoy the benefit of higher education while the have-nots would automatically be debarred because of high cost of higher education.

They said that curtailment of fees of IIMs was an eyewash.

AISA also criticised the recommendations of the U R Rao Committee and added that the conversion of the Bihar College of Engineering, Patna into a National Institute of Technology (NIT) was only an election stunt.

5,"Policemen hurt in clash, rifles looted","SASARAM: Six police personnel, including an officer in-charge and one ASI, were injured, and four police rifles were looted by an irate mob at Newras village under the Kudra police station of Kaimur district on Wednesday afternoon. Several other persons were also injured.

The police opened about 25 rounds of fire in self-defence.

After the incident, senior police officers reached the spot with additional police force and started raids to recover the looted rifles. All the injured have been admitted to a hospital.

Sources said that the local unit of the CPI(M-L) held a rally in protest against the assault of its cadres by the local mukhiya some days back, over the fishing right in a public pond. The meeting was organised adjacent to the residence of the mukhiya, Jay Prakash Singh.

As a precautionary measure, police force led by the OC and local BDO were deployed to maintain law and order. But the BDO was absent on the spot at the time of the incident.

The sources said that the ML leaders'' speeches provoked the mukhiya''s family members, who started firing at those present in the meeting.

The police also opened fire, leading to stampede. According to police, the ML supporters also opened fire. As a result, four police personnel, including the OC, received bullet injuries.

Police reportedly opened more then 25 round of fire, which injured about one dozen persons, including the mukhiya''s son, Vivek Singh.

Police said that when additional forces reached the spot, some persons attacked it and snatched rifles.

Later, police said, two rifles were recovered and raids are going on to recover the remaining rifles. No arrest has been made so far while an FIR has been lodged with the Kudra police station in this connection. Tension still prevails in the area.

6,New divorce law gives wife an edge,"MUMBAI: The newly amended matrimonial laws, while empowering the woman, appear to discriminate against men, say lawyers.

The amendment has been hailed by women activists who have long sought such a change in the law.

Earlier, under these two Acts, the wife and husband could file matrimonial proceedings only at the place where they last resided together or where their marriage had been solemnised.

Take for instance a couple who married in far-flung Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, resided in Bangalore and later parted ways with the wife moving to Mumbai.

The new law allows her to file a case in the family court at Bandra. ""She will be saved the rigours of numerous trips to Bangalore or Barabanki for each court hearing,"" said advocate Shrikant Bhat.

""So far, it was only under the Criminal Procedure Code that a wife could seek maintenance in a court located where she currently resided.""

""The earlier provisions in the Hindu and Special Marriage Acts seriously inconvenienced wives who were forced to file cases in cities or towns where they no longer resided,"" said former corporator and lawyer Kranti Sathe, welcoming the new law.

""In the absence of statutory provisions we had to move the high court or supreme court to transfer cases to family courts located in the areas where the estranged wife resided. This process was time-consuming and expensive.""

On the flip side, the new provisions are ""brazenly discriminatory"" against the husbands, said lawyer Shrikant Bhat. Husbands will still have to move the court where his marriage was solemnised or where he last resided with his wife. Also, the benefit does not extend to couples seeking consensual divorce.

The amendment is ""slightly discriminatory"" to men, said Ms Sathe, but added that since husbands rarely changed their residence, it would not affect them so much.

Advocate Shahrukh Khatawalla, who handles matrimonialmatters, pointed out that although women are entitled to claim payment from their husbands for the legal proceedings in family courts, they often do not get it as cases drag on for years.

""Husbands use this as a pressure tactic to get the wife living in another city to agree to their terms,"" he said. A second amendment to the matrimonial laws stipulates that an appeal in a divorce case can now be filed within 90 days instead of the existing 30 days.

""This will be a big boon for both parties. After the appeal period lapses, the spouses can remarry. At present, in contested divorce cases, if the divorce is granted on false premises and an appeal is delayed, remarriage by one party can cause chaos since a third person''s right comes into the picture,"" said Mr Khatawalla.

Although the enactment was published in the government gazette of December 23, 2003, most of its beneficiaries are still unaware of it. Mr Bhat said the government should do more to publicise new laws instead of merely publishing them in the gazette.

7,Taj case: UP govt denies reinstating the tainted,"LUCKNOW: The state government on Thursday denied passing any order to reinstate two senior IAS officers, P L Punia and V K Gupta, accused in the Taj Heritage Corridor (THC) scam.

There were rumours for the past two days that the Mulayam government has reinstated Punia, former principal secretary to the then chief minister, and former secretary, environment, V K Gupta, who were suspended on September 27 last year in connection with the scam, with former state chief secretary D S Bagga.

But chief secretary V K Diwan has categorically denied any such decision having been taken. ""No decision has been taken by the state government,"" he stated.

When asked if any such move was on, he said, ""Anything may happen but no decision has been taken till date.""

It was speculated that a decision to revoke the suspension of Punia and Gupta was being taken after nothing was found against them on the charges of dereliction of duty and corruption by the two-member probe committee, comprising A K Rastogi and V K Mittal.

8,Arif caught in political crossfire,"NEW DELHI: The case of former Union civil aviation minister Arif Mohammad Khan â€” who was scheduled to join the BJP on Thursday, but failed to turn up â€” may well turn out to be a test case for whether Muslim animosity against the party has been neutralised or not.

Caught in the crossfire between Muslims who are unhappy with his decision, and the BJP which wants him to join rather than have him merely campaign for it, Khan has been forced to take a fresh look at how to play his new equation with the BJP.

On Thursday, he met general secretary Pramod Mahajan to explain his predicament, stress that he wants no position and to ask for a few days more to talk to his supporters before he joins up.

On Friday, Khan is going to Bahraich, his constituency in UP, to talk to the maulanas and other Muslims there. Sources close to Khan say the news of his decision to join the BJP has provoked anger among the Muslims, with some youths even threatening to immolate themselves.

The local clerics have also conveyed to him that any decision regarding the BJP must be made in Bahraich.

The line Khan plans to take with Muslims is that since the Congress''s secular credentials are suspect, the BSP could join the BJP at any stage and reports suggest that the Samajwadi Party and the BJP are working in tandem, it is better to have a direct relationship with the BJP, and work towards changing the mindset of that party towards Muslims.

The BJP is confident that Khan will join the party, but Khan clearly wants the community''s approval to do so.

For the BJP, Khan''s joining the party â€” and his stated desire to neutralise Muslim animosity against the BJP â€” fits in well with its efforts over the last six years.

A BJP minister says, ""We don''t expect Muslims to vote for us, but we want to prevent them enthusiastically voting against us. So, look at our record: Barring Gujarat, the country has been, by and large, free of communal violence. We held a successful election in Kashmir, and are working to resolve the problem there; then there is the PM''s Pakistan peace initiative. Finally, post 9/11, the global Christian-Muslim animus has helped neutralise Muslims here.""

Additionally, he said, textiles minister Syed Shahanawaz Hussain and general secretary Mukthar Abbas Naqvi â€” unlike Sikandar Bakth â€” have been projected as ""real"" rather than ""token"" Muslims, and encouraged to wear their ""Muslimness"" on their sleeves.

It is against this background that Khan''s joining the BJP would be ""useful'', party sources said.

Khan says that since he does not wish to contest the elections, it is immaterial whether he actually joins the BJP or not.

9,New names in Sena list for LS polls,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena strategists are ready to throw up several new names for the Lok Sabha elections.

""There may be three to four firsttimers in the Sena list,"" a key party leader told TNN on Tuesday.

Out of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, the Sena''s share is 22, while its poll ally, the BJP, will contest 26 seats. Nashik mayor Dashrath Patil is being tipped to replaceMr Uttamrao Dhikle, who, alarmed by the Nashik constituency''s notoriety in not repeating its MP, is not keen on a second term.

Former minister and Sena MLA Leeladhar Dake is likely to be fielded from Raigad Lok Sabha constituency opposite former Maharashtra chief minister and veteran Congressman A.R. Antulay.

With Sena MP Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil joining Congress, the Thackeray party is on a look-out for a ''new'' face for the Kopargaon Lok Sabha constituency in Ahmednagar districtâ€”the ''akhaada'' of Congress in-fighting for decades.

Known as the czar of the cashrich co-operative movement, Mr Vikhe-Patil and his son, Radhakrishna, joined the Sena a couple of years ago.

While Radhakrishna became a minister in the Sena-BJP government, Vikhe-Patil Sr. was inducted in the Union cabinet in 1999 only to be dropped three years later.

""We have powerful candidates to take on Mr Vikhe-Patil,"" said Sena''s ''samparka-pramukh'' for Ahmednagar Arvind Nerkar.

The Shiv Sena''s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Nirupam is all set to contest from Congress MP Sunil Dutt''s Mumbai north-west constituency which has a remarkable presence of filmland personalities.

10,"Police scrutinise election funds of Gawli, Nikhalje","MUMBAI: The sleuths in the Mumbai police are keeping close tabs on the funding sources of underworld gangs given that members who have links with the underworld are readying for the elections.

With ''bhai'' Arun Gawli and Chhota Rajan''s brother Deepak Nikhalje planning to contest the forthcoming Lok Sabha and assembly elections respectively, the police are trying to ascertain the source of their funds.

Sources said Dawood Ibrahim''s brother, Iqbal Kaskar, who is currently in Arthur Road Jail, may run for the assembly polls from Nagpada or Umerkhadi constituency.

Election law debars only those persons who have been convicted and whose appeal is pending before a court.

""We suspect that the Gawli and Rajan gangs have stepped up extortion to fund their poll campaigns,"" said a crime branch officer.

In February 2002, Gawli aide Sunil Ghate successfully contested theMumbai corporation elections from ward number 28 (where Gawli''s home, Dagdi chawl, is situated), defeating his Shiv Sena rival by a huge margin.

Ghate is the only corporator from Gawli''s political outfit, Akhil Bharatiya Sena (ABS). Deepak Nikhalje was recently summoned to the crime branch unit in Ghatkopar for questioning.

The police asked him whether he was involved in the extortion activities of his brother''s gang. Sources said the police also grilled him about the various benami properties owned by Rajan in Mumbai.

In Gawli''s case, the police have deployed several constables in plainclothes to keep tabs on persons visiting Dagdi chawl, Gawli''s fortress in Byculla.

Said a crime branch officer, ""There are reports of some Gawlimembers restarting extortion in central Mumbai."" ''Daddy'' Gawli may deny that he is involved in criminal activity but the police are keeping tabs on the gang members and are even tapping their mobile phones.

A senior crime branch officer said, ""Gawli has even demanded police protection once he starts campaigning. Why should we give him protection? If he fears for his life, it is only because of his criminal past.""

While Nikhalje is set to contest from Chembur on a Republican Party of India (Ramdas Athavale faction) ticket, Gawli will represent the Akhil Bharatiya Sena for the Lok Sabha seat from south central Mumbai.

11,Bengal govt agency to teach staff communication skills,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has decided to go in for an image makeover within its ranks, in the belief that having good talkers in the organisation would help in attracting big investments.

As a result, for the first time in its history, the WBIDC has decided to formally teach some of its key employees how to communicate better.

A team from ""Shilpa Bandhu"" â€” the WBIDC''s single-window cell â€” and its public relations wing will soon be sent to a management institute at Gurgaon to pick up tips on how to make better presentations to prospective investors. Besides learning how to become aggressive listeners.

""The need for such a workshop for our staff has been felt for quite some time. In the competitive scenario in which we have to operate, it is most essential that the message we send out is understood exactly the way we would like it to,"" a top WBIDC source told TNN on Friday.

""Initially, four people would be sent for a proper course in communications at the Management Development Institute some time in April and we are hopeful that the move would pay rich dividends. We are sure our people thereafter would be able to use every available opportunity to hardsell the state,"" he pointed out.

The source said the corporation was also ""examining"" the possibility of having these communication courses in place for the highest-levels at the corporation. ""At the top-most levels, however, we may invite communication experts to conduct these courses here itself,"" he added.

West Bengal, it may be noted, is currently one of the fastest-growing Indian states and expects to receive investments of Rs 2,500 crore in the current fiscal.

The source said Frito Lay would soon start construction on its facility at Sankrail in Howrah. The US firmâ€™s coming in would prompt more companies to enter the food processing arena here. Dabur, incidentally, is setting up a facility in north Bengal.

12,Teachers' re-employment: DUTA on bandh,"NEW DELHI: There seems to be no end to the controversy over re-appointment of teachers in Delhi University. After declaring it would â€˜â€˜socially boycottâ€™â€™ vice-chancellor (VC), Deepak Nayyar, the Delhi University Teachersâ€™ Association (DUTA) held a university bandh on Friday.

Teachers have been alleging that the VC has been running the university in an â€˜â€˜arbitraryâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜dictatorialâ€™â€™ manner. University authorities, however, say that certain groups are unnecessarily creating controversy and trying to politicise the campus.

In the eye of the storm is the issue of re-appointment of DU teachers who are entitled to be re-employed for a period of three years after they reach retirement age.

â€˜â€˜We are bound by the Supreme Courtâ€™s directives which clearly state that re-employment must be given only to teachers who are proven to be â€˜distinguishedâ€™,â€™â€™ said DU pro vice-chancellor C R Babu.The court had also added that the universityâ€™s executive council (EC) guidelines were to be strictly followed in shortlisting candidates.

Teachers are upset as the university has not given re-appointment to all candidates this year. The main spark said to have led to the flare-up is the re-appointment of a prominent DU activist S S Rathi. The professor, who has also been heading a teachers body, has been denied re-appointment.

According to EC guidelines, a teachers is considered â€˜â€˜distinguishedâ€™â€™ on the basis of research work done, publications to his name, contribution to journals and other co-curricular activities.

â€˜â€˜The university prepared a comprehensive performa based on the EC guidelines. The document contains a number of parameters on which candidates from different academic streams are assessed,â€™â€™ said dean of colleges, Kiran Datar.

Campus Crossfire

* DU teachers upset over the universityâ€™s denial of re-appointment to some teachers

* Rejection of a prominent DU teacher activistâ€™s application said to be the main spark in the controversy

* DU authorities say they have followed SC guidelines which clearly say that only distinguished teachers should be re-appointed

13,It'll be four-phase elections,"NEW DELHI: It''s now certain: The Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in four states will be held in four phases.

At the outset of his daily briefing, Election Commission spokesperson A N Jha told reporters on Friday that the polls would be held in four phases. But he refused to say anything about the probable dates.

""We will tell you at the appropriate time,"" is all that he said.

Giving a detailed account of the poll preparations so far, Jha said that discussions at all levels were almost complete.

The EC has met the chief electoral officers, the chief secretaries and directors-general of police of all states, the Union home secretary and representatives of recognised political parties.

The requirement of security forces in different states is known. Only the dates remained to be announced for which, Jha said, the EC was factoring in the examination schedules, festivals, weather conditions and the harvest season.

On the meeting with representatives of political parties held on Friday, Jha said that a number of issues came up. Many parties, he said, wanted the model code of conduct to come into force immediately.

Asked about the EC''s stand, Jha said that Chief Election Commissioner T S Krishnamurty''s views on the subject were already known.

The parties, he said, also complained about drawbacks in the electoral rolls in various states. To this, the EC promised action immediately on specific complaints.

Some parties raised the issue of location of polling stations for weaker sections and also the timing of election dates.

Advertisements by the government, exit polls and opinion surveys by the electronic and print media were also discussed, Jha said.

The EC spokesperson denied reports of apprehensions about electronic voting machines (EVMs) and promised to circulate the report of an expert committee so that all misgivings on this score were set at rest.

In all, 10.75 lakh EVMs have been readied for the general and Assembly elections. These include nearly seven lakh EVMs for the booths, a mandatory reserve of 12 per cent EVMs and 3 per cent for training (to be used for staff training but which can be pressed into action any time).

About security forces, Jha said that the final figure had not been worked out. But he said it had been decided to use personnel from the state armed police.

The demand for more forces by states like Jharkhand, MP, AP, Orissa and Maharashtra, which facing extremist violence, has been given due consideration.

On the sidelines of the briefing, Jha said that it was practically impossible for the EC to meet the demand by some political parties asking for forces from outside a state on the ground that the state police would work in favour of the party in power.

Jha further said that the EC''s verdict on the fight within the NCP would be announced soon.

14,Haryana Govt announces new excise policy,"CHANDIGARH: Under the new excise policy of the Haryana government, the possession limit for the defence personnel and ex-servicemen has been increased from the existing six bottles per person to the specified quota in the Army order, which is 18 bottles.

The excise policy for the year 2004-05, which was approved by the state cabinet on Friday, has also done away with integrated quota system. And the quota for the next year has been fixed at 425 lakh proof litre and 175 lakh proof litre for country liquor(CL) and Indian Made Foreign Liquor(IMFL), respectively, with a facility to get up to 10 per cent of the CL quota convertible to that of IMFL.

Besides, quota of lifting has been been fixed at 25 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 25 per cent for the four quarters of the year.

In addition, the restriction of one ""ahata"" for 10 liquor vends has been lifted. It also provides for sale of liquor in pouches in addition to the sale in glasses and pet bottles, for illicit and smuggling prone areas of the state to be notified by the excise commissioner.

The bars can now sell medium range of IMFL along with Bacardi, Rum, Vodka etc., a facility which was withdrawn in the last policy. Besides, a new category of bar licence has been added with an enhanced licence fee of Rs 10 lakh where imported foreign liquor can also be served. This has been done keeping in view the fast changing corporate culture in Gurgaon and other places around Delhi and Panchkula.

The label fee has also been reduced to encourage the availability of greater variety in the market. Keeping in view the enhanced economic status of rural folks, the sale of IMFL has been permitted at rural vends. Besides, the export fee has been marginally increased and the licence fee of distilleries, breweries and wholesale liquor vends has been increased.

15,HP BJP chief asks party workers to unite for polls,"JWALAMUKHI: Himachal Pradesh BJP president Suresh Bharadwaj, on Friday, asked party workers to unite for the Lok Sabha polls to defeat Congress and capture all the four LS seats in the state.

This was the first state executive meeting of BJP after Bharadwaj took over the reins of the party. All 51 executive members, including O P Kohli, BJP national secretary and incharge HP affairs, former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, former Union rural development minister Shanta Kumar and Kangra district unit president Ramesh Dhawala attended the meeting.

However, contrary to speculation in some circles that the meeting could be a stormy affair and a repeat of the ugly 1997 episode, it went off peacefully with supporters of both Dhumal and Shanta displaying restrain.

Bharadwaj hinted that party rebels including those who formed Mittar Millan and had been expelled from the party could be taken back to strengthen the organisational network of the party in the state. Bharadwaj said that the rebels willing to come back into the party fold would have to apply to their respective mandal (block) for their readmission.

He said their re-admission request would be routed by the concerned district unit to the state unit accordingly.

Former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal underlined the need for strengthening the organisational structure of the party in the state.

Earlier, the state executive of the BJP also passed two resolutions in its meeting. In the first resolution, it alleged that no development had been made in the state in the past ten months after the present Congress regime took over.

The state BJP executive also alleged that Virbhadra government was ordering transfers of government employees on political considerations.

The second resolution passed by BJP executive demanded resignation of chief minister Virbhadra Singh for his alleged attempts to force the Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission chairman to resign from his post.

16,"Thakur, Kumari rally behind Virbhadra","SHIMLA: Himachal Pradesh industries minister Ram Lal Thakur and education minister Asha Kumari, on Friday, ridiculed the statement of former health minister J P Nadda in which he had said that chief minister Virbhadra Singh lacks vision.

Terming it as an immature statement from those who during their five year-term in office did nothing but indulge in scandals and drain the state economy for personal interests, they said that all the BJP leaders at the helm of affairs not only brought developmental works to a grinding halt, but shattered the economy.

They said it was rather astonishing that those very persons, should speak in such terms for a man who had steered the state for 13 long years, and during whose tenure HP had witnessed spectacular achievements and all-round development on all fronts.

The two ministers said that it was due to the gross financial mismanagement of the previous BJP government that the debt burden of the state had crossed the Rs 15,000 crore mark.

Alleging that the BJP leaders neither did anything constructive themselves nor were they allowing others to do so, they said that when the present Congress government was taking various decisions aimed at improving the socio-economic welfare of the people and accelerating the pace of development, the BJP leaders were coming out with mischievous and politically motivated statements.

Asking Nadda what he had done as health minister in the previous government for providing better health facilities to the people, Ram Lal and Asha Kumari alleged that Nadda had added to the woes of the masses by imposing user charges in hospitals, which the present government had withdrawn.
