0,"Militants targeting women, children, says J&K govt","new delhi: the jammu and kashmir government on thursday said the militants, at the behest of their masters from across the border, have been the only abusers of human rights in the state and have not spared even women and children. according to figures, the government said militants had so far gunned down 9,684 civilians since the inception of militancy, which included 97 children. the militants, at the behest of their masters from across the border, have been violating every norm of human rights and sending the word 'humanity' for a toss by not even sparing women and children, according to a newsletter of the state government. it said the pakistan-sponsored militants have so far killed at least 585 women and 97 children in the state ever since the outbreak of militancy. the killing of women and children by militants continues even now notwithstanding an orchestrated campaign by some elements about alleged excesses of security forces in the state, it said. it said this year alone 49 women and 16 children had so far become victims of militants' brutality as a part of their strategy to make people submit to their diktats and silence the possible voice of dissent. the decade-long militancy has also claimed the secular ethos and shrines of the valley, it added.

1,AJYCP to go ahead with 12-hour Assam bandh,"guwahati: the asom jatiyatabadi yuba chatra parishad (ajycp) will go ahead with its proposed 12-hour assam bandh on july 16 to protest the naga ceasefire extension despite chief minister tarun gogoi's appeal to call off the bandh. ''we stand by our call for a 12-hour bandh as the centre's promise to review the ceasefire agreement with the nscn (im) is a vague one and past experiences have taught us not to take promises of central leaders at face value,'' ajycp president, apurba kumar bhattacharya, said here on thursday. the student leader accused the centre of adopting a divisive policy and wondered what was preventing the centre from declaring a unilateral ceasefire with the ulfa and the national democratic front of bodoland. bhattacharya said that the ajycp's decision to call a bandh was necessary to draw the attention of the people of the state to the decisions taken on such important issues on the north-east from new delhi. the chief minister had earlier appealed to the ajycp to call off its proposed bandh in view of the announcement made by the prime minister regarding the review of the ceasefire extension and also because bandhs harm the state's economy.

2,SC upholds govt order on international seminars,"new delhi: the union government on thursday received a shot in the arm with the supreme court putting its stamp to the controversial home ministry order making it mandatory for the organisers of international seminars related to human rights or having participants from pakistan, china, afghanistan, bangladesh or sri lanka to seek prior clearance from the home and external affairs ministries. a bench comprising chief justice a s anand, justice r c lahoti and justice brijesh kumar observed that the restrictions imposed were perfectly justified as the sovereignty of the country was concerned. there were several instances where under the cover of international seminars large amount of illegal money had flowed into the country, the bench said while dismissing a public interest petition filed by the people's union for civil liberties (pucl). the bench further said: ``when the security of the country was in question, the government has the right to put certain restrictions on the organisation of international conferences.'' the petition filed by sanjay parikh had challenged the september 2000 office memorandum issued by the foreigners' division of the union home ministry and said the office memorandum was a restriction on the fundamental rights of organisations which wanted to seek information from participants abroad. pucl lawyer rajinder sachar said the fundamental right to expression not only included the freedom of expression but also the right to receive information. sachar said that under the constitution, a fundamental right could be curtailed only by means of a law enacted by parliament and not through an executive order like the office memorandum issued by the vajpayee government. the court clarified that the constitution did not make any difference between an enacted law and government order as far as imposition of restrictions were concerned. it said the office memorandum only prescribed a procedure to be followed by the organisers of international conferences and hence it saw nothing wrong in it. the memorandum says that it would be necessary to obtain prior approval and clearance of the home ministry for holding an international conference, seminar or workshop if the subject matter is ``political, semi-political, communal or religious in nature or is related to human rights.'' the order also applies to conferences on any subject proposed to be held in areas covered under the protected/restricted/inner line regime or which include participants from afghanistan, bangladesh, china, pakistan or sri lanka.

""a work programme to increase the recovery on an average by four to five per cent in the first stage has been drawn up for 15 fields. this work identified into 19 schemes is scheduled to be completed in the next five to six years with a cost of rs 10,000 crore,"" raha said here after a two-day meeting of the executive committee of ongc. the committee reviewed all the major projects with the focus on upgrading the technology, raha said, adding the company has also decided to hire hcl perot as a consultant to give an expert-review of the system. ""basically, the committee discussed about the need of technology upgradation and winding up of obsolete and redundant technologies,"" he said. he said the company also looked up for exploration strategies -- both long term and short-term -- in india and abroad and decided to set up an internal group of action. on the exploration front, he said the ongc has decided to hold more surveys in the country and obtain new data in this regard. ""we want to keep data for 50 years and preserving data is very crucial in oil business,"" raha said. ongc is looking for more tie-ups and opportunities abroad and talks are at a ""very delicate level"". success in mumbai high is central to any significant improvement in crude oil production in the next few years. efforts in this field involved detailed studies and review at different levels with the assistance of m/s gaffney cline and associates, a reputed international consultant. a multi-disciplinary team his been constituted to manage and oversee the project execution further. a board level sub-committee has also been set up to review progress and approve changes/modifications. the studies in mumbai high field in the last two years have proved conclusively that the quality of the materials and equipment has a direct bearing on well performance. hence, some special dispensations from government for ensuring the best in equipment and services acquired from outside sources would have to be considered vis-a-vis the practice of tendering for the lowest bidder, raha said.
