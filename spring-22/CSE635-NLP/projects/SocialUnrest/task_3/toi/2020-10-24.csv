5,Govt seeks consensus on rally ban verdict,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government is convening an all-party meeting on Wednesday to try and have a consensus on restrictions for political rallies in Kolkata.

The Trinamul Congress would first like to know what proposal the state government had worked out, before deciding on whether to attend the Wednesday meeting or not, Opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee said on Friday.

""We will write to the chief secretary on Monday, asking for the background paper of the meeting. We want to discuss it in the party before we go to the meeting,"" Banerjee said. ""For, the state government is preparing its stand in consultation with the Left Front partners and they will come prepared.""

The letter it got from the state chief secretary said the government had called the meeting to arrive at a consensus on the issue of processions and meetings. ""This by itself is inadequate,"" he said.

He says the state government should have called such a meeting before going to the division bench of the high court, challenging the single judgeâ€™s order in this regard. ""They are calling the meeting now because the government finds itself in a tight corner on the issue,"" he said.

Other important decisions had been taken without consulting Opposition parties, like increasing the price of milk and how to tackle the situation in government hospitals.

Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya, too, said the state governmentâ€™s offer would have to be decided within the party before the Congress took a decision on attending it. SUCI leader Provas Ghosh said his party would attend the meeting, but would not accept restrictions on holding of rallies and processions.

6,HC dubs Bihar govt 'heartless',"PATNA: Observing that the Bihar government was ""heartless"", the Patna High Court on Friday pilloried the state government for not initiating steps for early disbursement of Rs 50 crore deposited in the court for distribution among the employees of 19 sick public sector undertakings.

""The employees of these closed PSUs are dying of hunger. Their children are being deprived of celebrating festivals for want of money. But, the state government is sitting pretty and not even providing office and secretariat staff to a three-member committee constituted by the court for the disbursement of money among the staff. It appears the state government has become heartless,"" a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh observed.

When registrar general of the court informed the Bench that the state''s chief secretary, K A H Subramanian, felt a meeting between the chief minister and the Chief Justice could resolve the issue, Dhavan asked the registrar general to convey to the CS that he was prepared for talks with the chief minister anytime and anywhere.

7,Addl charge of many govt bodies makes IAS a totem,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government, it seems, is beginning to reach a point where it does not require full-time IAS bureaucrats to run important administrative divisions situated outside the Sachivalaya.

The latest addition to the long list is the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Ltd (TCGL), where DK Rao, IAS officer of the 1980 batch, was suddenly stripped of the post of managing-director.

D Jagatheesa Pandian, CEO, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) has been asked to additionally look after the post, which acquired importance during the Vibrant Gujarat business summit.

While internal departmental issues might have led to Rao''s ouster, including his refusal to ''submit'' to his immediate boss, industries secretary D Rajagopalan, during the business summit, the view is quite strong in the Sachivalaya that this is what happens if one tries to be too close to chief minister Narendra Modi.

Sidelined ever since his name figured in the infamous tandoori murder case despite having come off unscathed, Rao did an excellent job, from the CM''s angle, by ensuring early closure of several important post-communal riots relief camps.

Rao was rehabilitated. He became tourism commissioner and MD of TCGL, the posts held by current chief secretary PK Laheri for months after Modi came to power on October 7, 2001. Now devoid of a portfolio, none knows when would be get a new appointment.

But TCGL is just one more government body without a permanent IAS officer heading it. The search has been on for long to have CM''s ''trusted'' person to be posted on many of them, yet with little success so far. The task is even more difficult as some competent officials do not wish to remain in Gujarat, unlike in the past.

Failing to find competent IAS officials, the list of those holding additional charges is long. It starts with the CM''s principal secretary PK Mishra, who has for long been additionally looking after the Gujarat Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA), a statutory body.

Yet there is little effort to free it from the tentacles of the CM office. The additional CEO of GSDMA is also a part-time appointee.A. Bhattacharya''s full time job is secretary, urban housing, in the Sachivalaya.

The Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) saw a full-time appointee in GK Murmu, one of the CM''s most trusted persons.

However, Murmu lasted on the important post for just five months. He has now gone abroad to be trained in public administration. The post has been additionally given to CL Meena, whose full time job is of geology and mining commissioner.

The GMB combines the work of a regulator of the private ports with a corporate entity looking after the state''s 40-odd small ports. And it''s a full time job to restructure the mammoth body, by splitting the two activities, on agenda for five years.

The Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC), another mammoth body responsible for developing industrial estates, both in government and private sector, and also special economic zones, is also being looked after additionally by Hasmukh Adhia.

A Gujarati IAS official, which considered Adhia''s important qualification to be full-time additional principal secretary to the CM, he is also part-time CEO of the GIDC. The GIDC, like the GMB, urgently requires restructuring. It also combines regulatory and corporate functions, and plans to split the two have been pending for five years.

Similarly, there are no fulltimers to head the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board, Trade Commission, Fisheries Commission, Gujarat Industrial Investment Corporation (GIIC), Gujarat Export Corporation, the list is long, even as 28 state cadre IAS officials ""some of them cream of Gujarat"" are on Central deputation, unwilling to return.Two more have been just added to the list.

Women and child development secretary Rita Teotia has been posted as joint secretary, ministry of health, Government of India, and MK Mankad has got the posting of controller, Space Applications Centre.

8,Diwali: A clash of tradition and health concerns?,"VADODARA: Festivals are fun, but only so long as people keep tab on celebrations. Every Diwali, the fire men spend anxious moments, while a handful of doctors on duty fear inflow of critically ill patients.

Despite the Supreme Court ban on bursting crackers beyond 10 pm and use of crackers producing sound greater than 120 dB, there''s no stopping midnight blasts even in the residential and silent zones.

""All norms are flouted. As Diwali has social, economical and religious implications, stricter implementation of the law has not been possible,"" says Parul Trivedi, a commerce student. Like any festival, even during Diwali the tradition clashes with health and safety concerns. Fire incidents during Diwali have risen over the years forcing the Fire Brigade personnel to stay on alert for a week during Diwali.

Says Chief Fire Officer DA Patel, ""During Diwali, we get 15-20 fire calls, out of which at least two are major ones. Of late, we have started getting calls from the city outskirts, too. A major reason for the mishaps is sheer carelessness.""

""About 50 additional firemen from the Fire Academy have been roped in this year. Hoardings on fire safety have been put up to educate the masses,"" adds Patel.

Scientific data suggests that noise pollution can lead to hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart attack, respiratory disorders and sleep disturbances, say doctors.

""The most vulnerable section of the society are infants and the elderly. Senior citizens tend to have multi-system problems and higher noise level aggravates the same. Often, old people develop cardiac problems but are rushed to the hospital late, as the family is busy holidaying or celebrating Diwali. It is time we gave a serious thought to being considerate,"" says cardiologist Parvinder Singh.

""The widespread effect of noise is psycho-social one. Continual exposure to noise disturbs sleep patterns. Both short and long term exposure to noise can cause hypertension, hearing loss, lack of concentration in children,"" says psychiatrist Venkat Iyer.

""Even children who are not born get shivers in the womb if exposed to loud noise. In some cases it can affect the bowels of an infant,"" adds Iyer. According to the Supreme Court ruling ambient air quality standards in respect of noise should be 55 decibels in residential areas during the daytime (between 6 am and 10 pm) and 45 decibels in the night (between 10 pm and 6 am).

The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 has a specific insertion which makes an exception stating, ""The state government may, subject to terms and conditions as are necessary to reduce noise pollution, permit use of loudspeakers or public address systems during night hours (between 10 pm and midnight) on or during any cultural or religious occasion of a limited duration not exceeding 15 days in all during a calendar year.""

Also under the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) an erring party can be fined Rs 1 lakh and jailed up to five years. If public utilities are noise pollutants, their top executives can be prosecuted.
