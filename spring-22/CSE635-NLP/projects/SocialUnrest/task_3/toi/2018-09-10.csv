1,More financial powers for state govt,"new delhi: an amendment to the national capital territory act made by lok sabha a fortnight back will enable the city government to give guarantees for up and coming power projects on behalf of public sector undertakings functioning under it. with this, a major hurdle in the privatisation of the delhi vidyut board has been cleared. the amendment was proposed by the union ministry of home affairs. now, the government would also be able to take loans from the market for infrastructural development without seeking prior permission from the union government. bestowed limited powers, the delhi government was previously denied these privileges. finance is still not a state subject but with amendments to the nct act, the city government's limited financial powers have been enhanced. the privatisation of power generation was in limbo for the last few years due to the state government's inability to give counter guarantees. even as the government showed willingness to invite private players for investment in the power sector, private companies were reluctant to come forward due to the government's failure to offer financial security. power minister narendra nath said the government had been asking the centre for more financial powers to sanction power projects in the city. ``the issue was taken up in the chief ministers' conference held recently. now we will have a free hand in privatising the power sector in the city,'' he said. the delhi government has already tied up with bhel for setting up the 330 mw pragati power project. nath said the plant will start generating 100 mw from early next year. the government also has bawana i and ii projects in the pipeline. according to an official, the government would now be able to borrow money from the power finance corporation for setting up these projects.

2,Mamata alleges CESC-SEB-govt link,"kolkata: trinamul congress chief mamata banerjee feels that the cesc, wbseb and the state government are acting in collusion in the power tariff face-off. she also said that the three parties are deliberately fanning the controversy to justify a hike in tariff that has already been agreed upon. ""we have definite information that the cesc is going to increase power tariff by 30 per cent. this time if it is hiked on the pretext of reaching an amicable solution, the trinamul congress will take to the streets and bring things to a standstill,"" said mamata. talking to the media, banerjee said that all political parties were welcome to join the movement. ""if nobody else comes forward, the trinamul will take up the matter on its own,"" she remarked. banerjee pointed out that earlier too, her party had organised a 14-day dharna against the cesc. she said that the current face-off between the cesc and seb was contrived. the trinamul chief reacted strongly to the chief minister's proposal to hold an all-party meeting to curb blockades that disrupt public life. ""what was the cm doing all these years?"" she asked. ""why did not the party realise this when jyoti basu was the chief minister? having ruined two generations, now they are talking about all-party meetings. we will definitely express our opinion as and when such a meeting is convened,"" said mamata.

3,Officers pen plans to combat riots,"lucknow: communal riots, hardware, software. strange equations, one may think. but hardware here is described as the structure of the society and software the mechanism of weaving the social fabric. for instance let's say: communal riots in uttar pradesh is not so much a problem of the hardware as it is of the software. part of a comprehensive thesis on 'management strategies in combating communal riots', these conclusions have been made by an ips officer, ap maheshwari. he was recently conferred with a doctorate on the thesis. the compilation is based on surveys of 500 odd samples selected at random from seven important districts of the state. the study incorporates case study of communal riots in moradabad where maheshwari was posted. according to the survey, 93 per cent of the subjects stated that responsible citizens could help control communal riots, while 90 per cent agreed that these riots were often engineered. the study observes that it would be more closer to reality to assert that the indian state is constitutionally secular than to harp that indian state is secular. on the leadership crisis, the thesis outlines that the communal problem in the indian society is basically due to wrong leadership influences and social groups have been victims of power politics and devoid of effective leadership. the study elaborates on how the germs of divergent and conflicting interests were developed to the fullest by the british and how the partition of the country on communal lines provided a fertile breeding ground for communalism. framing the part played by the media in communal flare-ups, the ips officer notes that means of mass communication have a crucial role in tilting the human cognition and response pattern. quoting historical analysis, he adds that this powerful 'tool' has been exploited by vested interests despite strong ethical codes. approving of the fact that communalism is the problem within the system, the study states that it made its grip stronger either through elected representatives or civil servants or in the form of public response on communal lines. developed on the basis of management experience and intrinsic strength of workable concepts, the study focuses upon six significant strategies including development based strategies with a thrust on economic and social transformation, mass communication, evolving social cognition and intervention strategies based on 'competence' and 'compatibility' of the third party in the form of state functionaries or joint committee of various communities called mohalla samitis. apart from a caution against violation of human rights, the study concludes with justifying the need of 'harsh police action' during volatile situations of communal violence. when the situation on the spot worsens like the critical patient at icu or the internal resistance of the system goes down sharply and any limb becomes poisonous so much so that it becomes fatal for the rest of the body, an immediate surgery is called for. it is justifiable on grounds of avoiding greater evil. at times, the limit of 'reasonableness' are subject to 'unbounded rationalities', the thesis states.

6,'Taking policy decisions is no cakewalk',"new delhi: ishita chaudhary, a class 12 student of shri ram school, now realises that it is not easy to be an mp. after being appointed as president of the indian model of the un general assembly here, she has realised how much hard work goes into taking decisions which have a far- reaching impact. ""we are so quick to condemn them. but watching the proceedings of the 'general assembly' and the 'security council', albeit the indian model, i have realised how tough it is to govern,"" she said, on day two of the first session of the indian model united nations being held here. the three-day inmun has been organised by the ryan international & st xavier's group of schools which runs 65 schools all over the country. attended by nearly 600 students from 82 schools from all over the country, the exercise seems to be an enriching one. ""now, international news makes more sense to me,"" says ishita, who wants to become a diplomat one day. and for piyush jain, class 11 science student from ryan international school, vasant kunj, who is also the vice-chairperson of the inmun security council and ""hopes to rule the world"", the exposure to how the world operates, would definitely come handy one day. and some exposure it is. the 'security council' is busy discussing international terrorism. the ukrainian delegate, siddharth sunder from apeejay school, saket, for one, wants to know how to differentiate between a state sponsoring terrorism and one whose behaviour is objectionable yet cannot be termed a terrorist state. the example at hand is pakistan. adhering to the typical us stance, the 'us delegate', nikhlesh chand from vasant valley, butts in, ""pakistan cannot be called a terrorist state because it has cooperated with the un on many occasions to prevent terrorism even though it has terrorist training camps."" while the 'council' is yet to discuss the production, and stockpiling of bacteriological, chemical and toxic weapons, and palestine, the 'economic and social council' is grappling with debt relief, euthanasia and trafficking in women and the committees are on to the production and trade of genetically engineered food and more. however, the next project on their agenda, says grace pinto, director, ryan international & st xavier's group of schools, is a country-wide model parliament. ""parliamentarians of our generation never had a chance to practice their skills in model parliaments, but we want to make sure the next generation is well versed with how to represent their constituency and take decisions for the benefit of millions,"" she says.

7,Security alert against suicide attacks in J&K,"srinagar: security forces in kashmir are putting up mobile barricades, brick walls and booby-trapped fencing to deter suicide attacks by separatist militants, senior officers said monday. ""we have intensified the security and planned a number of strategies to meet the situation,"" inspector general of border security force (bsf), g.s. gill said monday. hardline separatist groups began suicide attacks last year, with the latest incident occurring just last week when a kashmiri militant drove a truck laden with explosives at a security camp, killing himself and two other people. ""these attacks are a manifestation of acute frustration on the part of the militants,"" said gill. ""my troops are now prepared to meet any such situation."" while gill declined to give details of the new security measures, another senior bsf official said mobile barricades had been positioned at the entrance to all security installations. ""plain-clothed bsf personnel have been deployed outside the entrances to keep a watch for possible suicide attackers,"" said the official who declined to be identified. explosive charges have also been rigged to existing barbed wire defences, which are in turn being replaced by brick perimeters. gill argued that most young kashmiris were turning their backs on the armed militant struggle, forcing the separatist groups to recruit an increasing number of foreign mercenaries. ""our intelligence inputs suggest that local militants are getting sick of the foreigners,"" he added.

""considering our size in the world economy, it was possible to insulate ourselves from it and frame our own strategies to strengthen the domestic economy,"" sinha said. he added that the economists wanted the government to take a number of steps, including speeding up privatisation of psus, downsizing of government as recommended by the expenditure reforms commission (erc), launching of food for work programme and encouraging further investments in sectors like construction and housing.

13,SC tightens bail rules in drug offences,"new delhi: making the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances (ndps) act further stringent, the supreme court has ruled that persons accused of offences which invite at least a five-year term should generally not be granted bail. ""a perusal of section 37 of the ndpsa leaves no doubt in the mind of the court that a person accused of an offence, punishable for a term of imprisonment of five years or more, shall generally be not released on bail,"" a bench comprising justice m b shah and justice s n variava said. the judgment is a fallout of an appeal by the madhya pradesh government challenging the high court order granting bail to one kajad who was carrying seven kg of opium. kajad was booked under ndpsa. the trial court rejected his bail plea and his appeal was also dismissed by the high court. without mentioning any change in the circumstances, the accused moved another application in the high court in august 2000, which was adjourned from time to time and ultimately he was granted bail. upholding the appeal, the bench said ""negation of the bail is the rule"" and its grant under exceptional circumstances were enumerated under section 37(1). the bench said ""for granting the bail the court must, on the basis of the record produced before it, be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offences with which he is charged and further that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail"". quashing the bail granted to kajad, the bench said ""liberal approach in the matter of bail under the ndpsa is uncalled for"". in the instant case, the high court judge had granted bail on his own sense of observation regarding the course of conduct adopted by the accused at the time of his interception and arrest. the bench said: ""section 37 of the ndpsa had been referred in the judge's order not for the purposes of showing of its compliance but to justify the passing of an apparently wrong order."" taking a highly critical view of the high court order granting bail to the accused, the bench said: ""`if, besides referring to section 37 of the ndpsa, the learned judge would have referred to its provisions, he would have not fallen prey to the ulterior designs of the accused."" on the successive bail applications of the accused, the apex court said: ""it is true that successive bail applications are permissible under the changed circumstances. but without the change in the circumstances, the second application would be deemed to be seeking review of the earlier judgment which is not permissible under criminal law.""

14,State govt moves Supreme Court in PCCF case,"ahmedabad: gujarat government has moved an appeal in the supreme court of india against the order of gujarat high court to appoint chief conservator of forests (social forestry) ashok kumar to the post of principal chief conservator of forests. dr sanat chavan, the chief conservator of forests (narmada), was appointed to the post of the pccf from august 1, following retirement of d p s verma. however, kumar who is senior to chavan, had objected to the appointment and moved the high court. he was chosen for the post by the departmental promotion committee (dpc) last year but he was not appointed. once again, the committee met on july 31, 2001, despite the pending recommendation of the earlier dpc. kumar was not appointed after the meeting but was instead handed over a charge-sheet and chavan, also an indian forest service officer of 1968 batch as kumar, was appointed. the charge levelled against him was that when he was conservator of forests of mehsana, in capacity of a disciplinary authority, he had not given sufficient punishment to a range forest officer for forging the documents regarding payment of salary to a beat guard. kumar had submitted that he was victimised and was denied promotion by manipulation, which was upheld by the court. highly placed sources in the forest department claim that there were number of charges pending against kumar and the file was with the forest and environment minister, kanjibhai patel, who had not forwarded it to the chief minister for initiating action. it is also believed that a charge-sheet based on just one of the several charges was prepared and handed in a haste. moreover, the state government has also set up an inquiry by retired ias officer c r biswas into the report submitted by the state vigilance commission on charges against kumar. the report is expected sometime later this month. considering the fact that kumar was due for retirement on september 31, the state was not allowed a stay on the order in order to approach the supreme court. the high court had asked the state government to immediately appoint him but the state preferred to move the apex court. following this a contempt petition was also filed in the high court, on which the high court issued notice to additional chief secretary for environment and forests p k ghosh to remain personally present before the court on september 14, to purge the notice. the high court had described the charge-sheet as ""stale"" and observed that the only reason for it was to deny him the legitimate right to be promoted and posted as pccf of gujarat. it was also questioned that though there were two posts of the pccf, the other one being that of the managing director of the gujarat state forest development corporation, why was the other post downgraded.

15,Wary govt bars teachers from by-election duty,"ahmedabad: teachers who took part in the strike are likely to lose out on the extra bread that usually followed an election with the sabarkantha and ahmedabad district administration having reportedly 'barred' them from duty in the by-elections scheduled on september 20. instead the sabarkantha district education officer has invited guardians to run schools on a daily allowance of rs 200! the temporary office created is that of a 'visiting teacher', who, according to the release, should be eligible to perform the duties of a teacher. observers feel that this teaching duty could also stretch on to 'polling duty'. as if this was not enough, the ahmedabad district administration would conduct an 'audit' on the teachers and evaluate how best have school premises and the grants been used. teams would visit each school beginning tuesday and assess 'possible violations'. in a smart move on monday, sabarkantha deo in a press release invited guardians to form a committee and help manage schools. every candidate would be paid rs 200. congress leaders who had questioned the budget proposal in the assembly to recruit vidya vyavsay preraks in schools and vidya sahayaks for promoting literacy in tribal areas said the decision on 'visiting teachers' was "" another move to rig elections by using unfair means as the bjp knows it is losing"". interestingly, these moves have been made only in districts that go to polls in less than a fortnight, thus indicating a possible nexus between the strike and the elections. the office of the chief election officer, however, does not feel that this will affect elections in any way. according to deputy election officer jp jadeja, ""polling duty is basically for primary teachers who are not on strike and secondary teachers are roped in only as the last resort"". he added that the election office would rope in the services of the panchayat and central employees. officials say that at least 8,000 people would be employed on polling duty in the sabarkantha parliamentary constituency while 2,000 will be deployed in the sabarmati assembly constituency. officials from the ahmedabad collectorate were also assured that polling would not be affected by the strike. ""we have begun our training programmes for those who will be on election duty and each participant will be paid rs 225 "", an official said. according to an official in the sabarkantha deo, the teachers who have repeatedly revealed their anti-bjp stand, have virtually lost the confidence of the people and their integrity is not beyond apprehension. the returning officers, both of sabarkantha and banaskantha as four talukas of banaskantha (danta, vadagam, amirgadh and 58 villages of palanpur) come under the sabarkantha constituency) are believed to have received instructions to this effect. bjp workers during their electioneering meeting are learnt to have demanded that teachers be kept away from the work of presiding or polling officers in view of their anti-party statements repeatedly made during their agitation. even college teachers from both the districts are being enlisted for election duties, the official said.

16,Concern over transfer of Kandla land to state govt,"gandhidham: trade and industry circles in gandhidham and kandla have expressed concern over a reported move by the state government to take over land from the kandla port trust and establish its complete control over the land. the area in kpt complex includes kandla, gandhidham, adipur and surrounding areas which was acquired for the development the port. the kandla port was developed after partition in view of the loss of karachi port to pakistan. the ownership of the land in and around kandla was vested in the president of india, and its administration was placed under kandla port trust. a portion of the land was given to the sindhu resettlement corporation (src). some other plots of land were allotted to individuals on a 99-year lease. the lease-holders of this land have been demanding that the land which was given to them on lease should be converted into a free-hold land, and they should be vested with ownership rights. while there has been no response from the authorities on the demand by the lease-holders, the kpt has been charging the allottees, from time to time, revised rent. and, huge transfer fees have been levied for transfer of lease-hold rights. this transfer fee was introduced in the name of ""unearned increment on development cost'' for transfer of leased land. in addition to this, the kpt used to levy mortgage fee in case the lease-holder intended to mortgage the land. while the lease-holders have yet to sort out their problem with the kpt authorities, there is a proposal to hand over the land in and around kandla to the state government. leading citizens and the lease-holders have opposed this proposal. trade and industry sources as well as leading citizens argue that before handing over the land to the state government, the kpt should transfer the ownership of the land to the lease-holders. these circles are also not happy with the way the state government has treated this area over the years. for instance, there are central government's public sector undertakings like iffco, special economic zone and oil companies situated in the complex. all these areas have not received proper attention from the state government over the years because some of the responsibility, particularly providing basic amenities like water supply and drainage, vests with the state government. the state government, they pointed out, has not provided basic amenities like water supply from machhu-2 dam and water supply through pipeline from the narmada project. lease-holders say the government did not handle the cyclone of 1998 and the earthquake satisfactorily. as a result, the lease-holders feel that if the ownership of kandla land is handed over to the state government, it would further complicate matters for them. the total land at the control of the kandla port trust is 2,20,416 acres of submerged land, and 2,175 acres of shore land. even a section of kpt is opposed to the transfer of land to the state government, for whenever the state government needs land it gets it from the kpt, whether for the purpose of building housing colonies by the gujarat housing board for the kpt staff, for guest houses and for that matter any other purpose. the lease-holders also point out that the land ownership was originally vested in the president of india, but after 1974 the draft lease agreement mentioned the name of trustees of the port of kandla, instead of president of india. the lease-holders question if at all the union ministry of surface transport has the right to hand over the ownership of the land at kandla to the state government. the administration of kpt at present is being looked after by two ias officers of gujarat cadre who are on deputation to the union government. these officials, the lease-holders feel, do not function in an impartial manner in dealing with their problems as they are repatriated after their tenure ends with the kpt. while the kpt earns good revenue from the land, it does not shoulder the responsibility providing basic amenities to gandhidham town. these functions are looked after by the gandhidham municipality, state water supply and sewerage board. as a result of multiplicity of authority, residents and industrial units do not get proper civic services. a section of the lease-holders feel that the powerful builder lobby has an eye on the vast kandla land. once it is transferred to the state government, the builder lobby would purchase it and jack up the price. at present, it is very difficult for anyone to get land from the kpt on lease. a section of the lease-holders even demand that entire kutch should be given the status of a union territory, as was envisaged in the constitution, for its better administration which would benefit even kandla port and its surrounding areas.

19,Even Nehru was not a patriot: VHP,"kochi: the viswa hindu parishad (vhp) believes that the first prime minister jawaharlal nehru was not patriotic. the parishad's opinion came out when it joined issue with cardinal mar varkey vithayathil who has admonished chief minister a.k. antony for the statement that ""saffron"" reflected ancient indian ethos and should not be used in derogatory spirit. antony had rapped the cpm of chanting the ""saffronisation"" mantra for all acts of the bjp-led nda. he said the manner of marxians holding the saffron colour in contempt was born out of ignorance. all those who wear saffron clothes were not adherents of the bjp-rss. some christian priests also wore saffron robes. antony, it is pertinent, had not sent any representative to the cpm-sponsored meeting at new delhi to denounce ""saffronisation of education."" the cardinal felt offended at antony's defence of the saffron. antony, according to the christian head, was not upholding secularism when he appeared to be defending ""hindu fundamentalism"". a vhp secretary, d. manikantan, said in a statement that some leftist ""intellectuals"" and church had shown a tendency to accuse the bjp-led government at the centre of ""saffronising education"". the intemperate language used against even the prime minister of the country was symbolic of arrogance shown by some spiritual heads in india, said the parishad functionary. ""we accept the fact that the christian priests are conducting various educational institutions throughout the country. it is our firm belief that the products coming out of those institutions lack a deep sense of patriotism or attachment to the motherland. even our first prime minister can be accused of such an attitude"", the statement averred. the parishad has sounded a warning that if the attitude is not changed, it could provoke the majority community.
