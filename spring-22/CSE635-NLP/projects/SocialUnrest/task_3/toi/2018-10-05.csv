1,Airport was on hijack alert since Oct 1,"new delhi: the alliance air hijack drama started minutes before a three-day alert at indira gandhi international airport regarding a possible hijack was to end on thursday. security agencies at the airport had been warned by intelligence agencies against a possible hijack on the mumbai-delhi sector between october 1 and october 3. the anonymous call informing the airport about the ''hijack'' of alliance air's flight cd 7444 was received at 11.22 pm — 38 minutes before the alert was to end. the alert was sounded on the basis of specific intelligence inputs that an indian airlines flight on the sector could be hijacked between october 1 and october 3. alliance air is a subsidiary of indian airlines. the situation turned tense in the air traffic control tower—the only communication link with the ''hijacked'' plane—when the pilot of flight cd 7444 conveyed his suspicions about trouble aboard the aircraft. the air traffic controllers tried to reconfirm the message with the pilot in code. ''the pilot confirmed the message but he didn't use the code, apparently because he had ensured the cockpit was inaccessible to anyone else,'' an official said. the control tower was taken over by officials the intelligence bureau soon after the ''hijack'' message was confirmed. ''from this point on, a pre-defined drill was followed. the air traffic controllers took orders from the intelligence bureau officials who had arrived on the scene,'' the official added. even before the ''hijacked'' plane touched down in the capital, the security personnel had studied the list of passengers aboard the plane and listed possible ''hijackers''. officials said all agencies at the airport are regularly briefed about their role in case of an emergency. ''we are just part of a very large exercise which is coordinated by the intelligence bureau,'' an air traffic controller said. secrecy is the key to the success of a mock emergency drill. and hijack is just one of five mock exercises practised by various airport security agencies. one of the most significant mock hijacks was conducted in 1986. the exercise, codenamed sour grapes, involved the mock hijack of an indian airlines plane. the permission for mock exercise had come from the prime minister's office. the purpose behind the exercise was to expose the security chinks at delhi airport. airport sources said a mock drill, though kept secret till the last minute, requires approval from the civil aviation ministry and, specifically, the bureau of civil aviation security.

5,Brit cops dish out advice on laws they left behind,"vijayawada:two british police consultants representing the individual and organisational development and assessment (ioda) agency opined that the existing indian police laws framed by the britishers have ""outlived their utility and have become obsolete to enable the people the service they deserve."" addressing a press conference along with the city commissioner of police n v surendra babu here on thursday, richard mellers and rick wood of ioda pointed out that the indian police act of 1861 was framed by the british to serve a particular purpose during their regime here. it no longer served the interests of the people of independent india, they said. richard and wood were here to interact with the members of the community policing groups (mythri) and non-governmental organisations on the policing methods being adopted here. surendra babu was one of the nine senior police officials from the state to visit the uk to study the policing methods there. the ioda consultants were currently touring the state to study how the nine police officials were following the better policing procedures. richard and wood pointed out that andhra pradesh has emerged as a benchmark state in the country with regard to policing by adopting a positive approach."" the approach to policing has changed dramatically in ap with a team spirit developing among top police officers.there is a better police-public relationship and co-ordination now under the leadership of director general of police h j dora,"" they pointed out. the policing here has changed from personality-based to systems and procedures-based ensuring access to justice to poor. the british consultants lamented that police here have been working in extreme circumstances braving several odds like poor amenities in police stations, poor pay scales and lack of other basic facilities. the living conditions of police in the state were also worse. ""despite all these the policemen are doing a commendable work,"" they complimented. with public support, things would eventually improve, they felt. the foreign and commonwealth office (fco) of the uk, ioda and the national human rights commission of india have jointly launched a training programme for 1000 police personnel from across the country to bring about a behavioural change. ""the police brutality has become a cause for great concern as 70 per cent of the complaints to nhrc relate to custodial deaths. hence there is an urgent need to reform the police behavioural approach,"" wood and richards said. the training programme would be a continuous process and would cover all police officers and men in the country. they lauded the efforts of the ap police who introduced behavioural change as part of training.

6,SP not SIMI behind Lucknow violence: Bajrang Dal,"bahraich: the bajrang dal leader of awadh pranth, mr ramesh mani tripathi, said that the samajwadi party (sp) and not the student islamic movement of india (simi) was responsible for the recent violence in the state capital in which many innocent lives were lost. talking to newspersons here recently, the bajrang dal leader said that in indian constitution every citizen had a right to express his views. but it did not permit anybody to indulge in anti-national activities and the simi by extending its support to osama bin laden had disgraced those who had sacrificed their lives for the motherland, he said. accusing some political parties of following appeasement policy to win the confidence of members of a particular community, he regretted that not a single politician had expressed sorrow over the killing of adm pathak who was shot dead by terrorists during kanpur riots. he said that the dal would not spare all those who were working against the country's interest. regarding the building of the ram temple in ayodhya, mr tripathi said that the dal would start the construction work anytime after maha shivratri. ""now we will not tolerate any hindrance in the construction of ram temple,"" he said. claiming that the dal would also deploy bajrangis on the indo-nepal border to check the infiltration of anti-social elements, he said that they had already chalked out a strategy in this regard and the issue would be finalised in the next meeting of the dal. meanwhile, the co-organiser of the bajrang dal, mr manoj jaiswal, said that they had enrolled 3,500 youths in this region against the target of 10,000 so far. the membership drive would be intensified to meet the target at the earliest, he added.

7,Deras to play key role in polls,"jalandhar: there is talk that deras will play a decisive role in the vidhan sabha elections apart from money. besides, given the character of the doaba region, nris are also expected to play a role not only by contributing money but mobilising their relatives and fellow villagers. having tasted uncertainty, especially after the recent backlash against sikhs, they would like to strengthen their hold at home. the grapevine is rife with rumours that bahujan samaj party's kanshi ram, who has rented a house at jalandhar, is in touch with the sants of an influential dera near the city. chief minister parkash singh badal has also begun doing the rounds of some key deras of doaba who can influence their large following to vote for party candidates.the deras can also be mobilised to neutralise rivals who owe allegiance to other deras and a war of words between sants and mahants is on the cards. as for the fortunes of various political parties, it is being said by veterans that the congress will be doomed if it succumbs to the 'taichicase' culture of giving tickets to rich candidates. congress veterans, who are not being consulted by the present leadership, feel that tickets must be given on merit and criticise the entry of the rich into the political arena. another weakness is the lack of a ""strategy cell"", something that is key to the old congress tradition. the anti-incumbency factor will be important this time in the absence of a wave or burning issues. in that case the ""tonnes of money"" being distributed in sangat darshans while the prospective akali candidate from that particular constituency sits on stage will not have the desired effect. besides panthic morcha leaders simranjit singh mann and gurcharan singh tohra are working round-the-clock to prove theirs is the real akali dal. should they succeed a new-look akali dal will emerge. another crucial factor in the doaba is the dalit vote. if kanshi ram is able to convince the dalits that without the bsp's support the akalis will not be able to form a government, he could translate their numbers into seats.

9,Outspoken minister miffs city doctors,"kolkata: state health minister surya kanta mishra's observation that doctors are not well-trained evoked mixed response in the city's medical circles. though doctors admitted the deteriorating standards of medical education, most of them squarely blamed the state government for the sorry state of affairs. the doctors are ill-trained. half the younger generation post-graduate doctors cannot even perform surgeries on their own. this lack of confidence stems mainly from the fact that most doctors have left the teaching profession after the introduction of the contract system the decision to debar doctors from private practice, said dr bijnan bera, secretary, medical services centre, a voluntary health organisation. there is little incentive for the teaching staff. moreover, infrastructural support is totally lacking and all these years, nobody has even tried to build the infrastructure, said arnab sengupta, reader, chittaranjan national medical college and a member of medical teacher's association. for example, the library remains open only from 11 am to 4 pm. now this is totally illogical as most of the classes are also held between these hours. this might be a small instance, but it goes a long way to show what kind of importance we give to medical education, he said. the mta had earlier submitted a memorandum to the governor seeking his intervention to check irregularities in medical education, but little has been done yet, the doctors claim. we have only taken the initial steps in the right direction. we have not been able to solve all the basic problems concerning public health, he comments.

15,Pakistani spy arrested in UP,"varanasi: a pakistani national, jalaluddin alias jalal, who had been spying at several places including the cantonment areas of kolkata, army establishments of the north-east and varanasi, was arrested by the police from ghazipur district and sent to jail on wednesday. jalal can speak urdu, arabic, english and hindi. he had been passing information and maps of cantonments through e-mail to pakistan for about a year. he has already ''covered'' cantonments of fort william in kolkata, meghalaya, aizwal, gangtok and varanasi. jalal was caught red-handed from a cyber cafe while sending information with a map of the visakhapatanam naval base. jalal, who was produced before the press on wednesday evening, said he visited only kolkata. he also visited delhi thrice to take money from pakistani agents. born in 1972 in rajshahi (bangladesh), jalal and his family shifted to pakistan in 1974. after completing his matriculation, he frequently visited dhaka for trading purposes. in 1999, he landed in kolkata and after staying there for a week, left the city. ssp anil agrawal said jalal told the police that his visits were business trips, but it seems that he was involved in smuggling. during interrogation, he said that he had taken a loan of rs 60,000 and had no means to repay it. when working as a middleman at passport office in pakistan, a youth took him to a pakistani army official, who asked jalal to work as a spy in india. he was assured that his debts would be cleared by the army in return for his services. jalal then started preparations for coming to india , but could not get a visa. he therefore stole the passport of an indian national, zubair of meerut, who never returned home after june, 2001, changed the photograph and came to delhi on june 9. after sending information on the ne and kolkata army bases, he reached ghazipur. his target was the varanasi cantonment. jalal's network across the country is also interesting. the members of his network share the same password and username. instead of sending information through e-mail, they save the composed matter in the draft section of the mail. this way, the other user can see the message. jalal also recorded messages in code words in his personal diary. several phone numbers of pakistani army officials are also mentioned in the diary. agrawal said the police haven't been able to detect the names and addresses of other members of this network as yet.

16,The prince who will be king,"new delhi: his former housemaster at doon school, sumer singh, recalls 30-year-old jyotiraditya scindia as being completely unaware of his wealth. ''in fact, when he came home, he would even wash the dirty dishes in the sink. in my office, he would often sort out the pens on my desk.'' always more studious than sporty, he became captain of jaipur house, but his first real rebellion occurred when he was leaving school. his father wanted him to go to his alma mater, new college, oxford. ''jyotir came to me and said he wanted to go to harvard and not to oxford where the admission had been fixed by his father. he always wanted to impress his father because he admired him a lot. when he got in to harvard, his father called me up to say he was delighted that his son was taking his own decisions,'' says singh. in a sense, jyotiraditya's break with tradition occurred earlier, when he was sent to doon, instead of scindia school, which his grandfather jivajirao established in 1897. the story goes that a seven-year-old madhavrao was once sent back from a three- day break as punishment because he had forgotten to thank his headmistress. at harvard, where he worked 18-hour days, jyotiraditya had an even more famous classmate, rahul gandhi. he worked for financial consultancies, among them morgan stanley in mumbai. in 1994, he married 19-year-old, welham-educated priyadarshini, daughter of sangram sinhji gaekwad of baroda, and they have a six-year-old son. he then left for stanford for an mba, returning to india only over a month ago. ''but politics was inevitable,'' says dhiren chauhan, congress member and brother-in-law of his sister chitrangada. having helped in his father's past few campaigns — even organising scooter rallies in 1998 — he had announced his decision to be based in gwalior last month. and he had invited the public to approach him with problems, in a clear threat to the sitting bjp mp, jaibhan singh. in fact, even as mourners gathered to pay their last respects to madhavrao scindia, posters announcing a mini-marathon for october 6, dubbed unity day, were plastered all over gwalior. this was to be jyotiraditya's first official acknowledgement of his new vocation. now with guna, his father's constituency, falling vacant, his political baptism has come in circumstances that the soon-to- be-anointed head of the house of scindia could have never desired.

""the allegations were false and contrived by nigam to impress upon a foreign company which was looking for a representative in india,"" he said. nigam had also similarly submitted in an affidavit before venkataswami commission that the allegations against pathak were ""false"" and he had only said it to impress upon the foreign company. in a letter to mahesh jethmalani, tarun tejpal said when tehelka.com published the transcripts relating to hiren pathak there was no reason to disbelieve the utterances made by nigam. ""his retraction today is a subsequent event. therefore, the website was under a bonafide belief that what was said on the tapes was correct."" ""the story published by us was in public interest and not to target any individual. if rakesh nigam has lied, as he now pleads, it is regretful that we gave him space on our website.""

""although jogi claims to be a tribal, he had introduced an anti-tribal excise policy and started teaching english in primary schools even when shiksha karmis had not been paid salaries for the last seven months"", he said.

19,Anti-terrorism law will have safeguards,"new delhi: the anti-terrorism ordinance being prepared by the law ministry will have enough safeguards, says a senior official of the law ministry. ""it will not be as stringent as tada. in fact, our aim is to focus on new methods adopted by terrorists world over, including india. we are concerned about the almost-universal language of terrorists,"" he said. talking about the safeguards, the official says, ""in tada there is a provision that till prosecution agrees there will be no bail. in the ordinance we are suggesting that this provision should be loosened. there will be an element of discretion now."" unlike tada which made confession before police admissible, the ordinance will make it compulsory that accused reiterates his statement before a judicial authority. another highlight of the ordinance, says the official, is that review of retention will take periodically. ""we are being careful about human rights to avoid the ordinance from becoming controversial,"" he explained. the ordinance being finalised in close coordination with the home ministry will be promulgated ""soon.""
