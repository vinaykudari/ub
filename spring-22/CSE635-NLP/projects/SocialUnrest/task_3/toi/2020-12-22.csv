1,ABN Amro is new airport development consultant,"NEW DELHI: The civil aviation ministry has shortlisted ABN-Amro Financial Services as the financial consultant for the governmentâ€™s mega privatisation plan for Delhi and Mumbai airports. ABN Amro was selected among the 11 parties who had submitted bids in the second round of bidding.

This decision will now be conveyed to the group of ministers (GoM) and their final consent sought this week, a senior government official told The Times of India.

The GoM is expected to meet this week to finalise the appointment.

This would kickstart the airport privatisation process that had hit a small turbulence after the GoM decided to scrap the initial bids invited for the consultant. The GoM had also directed the civil aviation ministry to redraft the tender document for the financial consultant. Under the fresh guidelines, the consultant would be chosen on the basis of its technical expertise rather than the financial aspect, the official said.

The redrafted document put greater weight on the financial qualification of the company.

""The earlier document also included a clause that said the interested company should have an Indian experience in handling infrastructure projects. Such a clause is not necessary and may filter out some good companies. So, we have decided to scrap this clause. Also, the earlier document restricted firms from holding roadshows,"" the official added.

Under the new guidelines, the government has decided to set a fee for the financial consultant and decide the appointment on the merit of the companyâ€™s past experience. ""With this, participating firms would know what they would be paid for the exercise and they can either be part of the process or not,"" the official added.

Officials pointed out that the bids were scrapped on the insistence of finance minister Jaswant Singh, who had expressed his displeasure at the process followed to select the financial consultant.

""The government had followed its age-old norms of selecting the lowest bidder rather than weighing its technical expertise. It is too big and too prestigious a project to be handed over to the lowest bidder. We want the best firm to handle this project.""

While all the 12 firms, which had initially bid for the exercise, were invited for second round, officials said Ernst and Young (which was the lowest bidder in the first round) did not submit its bid this time round. The other bidders includes Tata Economic Services, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and KPMG.

According to nephrologists here, compared to Kerala, the transplant rules were more ''relaxed'' in Tamil Nadu. Those wanting a ''Malayali'', ''Muslim'' or a ''Hindu'' kidney can get the same in Tamil Nadu, while it was impossible here, they say.

In Kerala, the approximate expense for renal transplant is between Rs 1.5 to Rs two lakh, while it was over Rs three lakh in neighbouring states, doctors here say.

5,Bars protest against CAT abolition move,"LUCKNOW: A meeting of presidents and secretaries of all the bar associations of Lucknow was held here on Monday to oppose the proposed amendment in the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985.

RC Saxena, president of the Central Administrative Tribunal Bar Association, presided over the meeting. The meeting took a decision that members of all bar associations would abstain from judicial work on December 24 to oppose the Bill.

The meeting lodged its protest against the government move for having brought the Bill on October 24, 2003 to amend the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 by adding Chapter IV (A), an enabling provision for abolition of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) or any of its benches by notification of the executive Central government) if it (the Central government) was satisfied that the existence of the CAT or any of its benches was not necessary.

According to AP Singh, secretary of the CAT Bar Association, as per the provisions of the Bill, the government might make a provision in the notification for transfer and disposal of cases pending before the CAT in any of its benches immediately before such abolition to some other authority.

6,Cement price spiral costs govt Rs 100 cr,"HYDERABAD: With cement prices touching the skies, the state exchequer is saddled with an additional burden of Rs 100 crore.

All the government departments put together use a minimum of 1.5 million tonnes of cement annually.

Institutions such as the Andhra Pradesh Housing Corporation source their material directly but the irrigation, roads, building and panchayat raj departments prepare budget estimates for their projects, depending on the market prices.

Government sources said the AP Housing Corporation recently placed orders for about 2 lakh tonnes of cement for its weaker sections sections housing project. But the department did not reckon that cement prices would rise from Rs 100 per a 50 kg bag a couple of months ago to Rs 150-160.

Assuming that cement firms quote a lower price for bulk consumers like government departments, the corporation is coughing up about Rs 12-15 crore more.

The panchayat raj and municipal administration wings are building about 35 lakh toilets, of which they have completed half the number. Each toilet needs a minimum of three bags of cement.

With the government deciding not to hike the Rs 2,750 subsidy component for each toilet, the increase in cement prices is likely to cast a Rs 20 crore burden on either the executing department or the end users.

The irrigation and roads & buildings departments, both bulk consumers of cement, are not directly affected by the price rise. But the departments'' engineers prepare estimates on the basis of the market prices of inputs.

""We are under pressure from our contractors to increase the standard schedule rates for cement and steel. If we refuse, they will compromise on quality,"" a top official said.

8,'Laloo knew of move to arrest Siwan MP',"PATNA: Ousted DGP D P Ojha continued his attack on the RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and Siwan MP Mohd Shahabuddin on Monday. Talking to mediapersons, he said that the RJD chief had prior information about the steps taken by the Bihar police against Shahabuddin. ""Everything in Bihar has to have his prior knowledge"", remarked Ojha.

Recalling the days when he had ordered the arrest of Siwan MP in connection with the kidnapping of a CPI-ML supporter, Ojha claimed that he also had prior knowledge about the moves against him (Ojha) in the RJD. ""That was the drama,"" he remarked.

Ojha was however quick to claim that he had not ordered the arrest of Shahabuddin on the dictates of Laloo. ""But prior information was given to him about the police''s move,"" he said. However, after Laloo and Shahabuddin reached an understanding, he (Ojha) and other officials like the IG and SP were not willing to give the MP any concessions.

He asserted that he would move court for the transfer of ongoing cases against the MP outside the state and reopening of 14 criminal cases in which the MP had been acquitted because the evidences and the witnesses in the cases had been tampered with. He said that he would also seek handing over of three fresh cases against Shahabuddin, related to the Pratappur episode, to to the CBI. ""The Bihar police will treat the cases in the manner Shahabuddin wants them to be handled,"" he remarked.

Political observers feel that Ojha''s statement indicates that Laloo wanted to cut down the Siwan MP to size, as the latter was showing defiance, especially during hosting of the ""Lathi Rally"" at Gandhi Maidan. They say even when Ojha issued the orders to arrest Shahabuddin, there was a general perception within the RJD that the supremo wanted to cut down the Siwan MP to size.

Ojha, on his part, now claims that the Laloo''s anti-Shahabuddin venture received a setback after Muslims did not vote for the RJD''s Muslim candidate in the Sitamarhi bypolls. It was after this setback that the RJD chief started building bridges with Shahabuddin again.

The recent statements of Ojha are seen by RJD circles as a ploy to create differences between Laloo and Shahabuddin. ""Ojha is working at the behest of BJP. During his tenure as DGP, he repeatedly said that he was working without any pressure and not at the behest of anyone,"" senior RJD leader Ram Kripal Yadav pointed out.

9,Kayastha Mahasabha for change in quota policy,"PATNA: The youth wing of the Akhil Bharatiya Kayastha Mahasabha (ABKM) has demanded change in reservation policy which should be given on the basis of economic criteria.

Those who are economically weak should only be given the benefit of reservation while those who belong to the creamy layer should be denied such comfort, the ABKM said.

Talking to mediapersons, the national president of youth wing of the Kayastha Mahasabha, Ajay Srivastava ''Neelu'' said that it was unfortunate that the reservation policy was introduced for ten years only to jack up the status of the backward castes.

Now since most of people belonging to lower strata of the society have become economically strong they should be denied such relief, that too, at the cost of other people.

State chief of the Kayastha Mahasabha, Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, said on the occasion that all

district units of the Mahasabha had been abolished.

A fresh membership drive had been launched which would continue till January 15.

The mahasabha is aimed at organising a state convention in July. Besides, the mahasabha is planning to open job-oriented training centres at district headquarters for the unemployed youths, he added.

12,"A govt file has to cross 267 hurdles, says Jalan","NEW DELHI: A file moves 267 points (from one official to another) in the Planning Commission and mostly without any answer. This was newly-nominated Rajya Sabha member Bimal Jalan explaining what was wrong in the Indian bureaucracy in a discussion on the Appropriations Bill, 2003.

Jalan claimed that the economy would improve by one to 1.5 per cent of the GDP just by getting rid of institutional, legal and procedural complexities. He quoted attorney-general Soli Sorabjee to point out that Indian tax laws were the most complex ones with the maximum number of sections, sub-sections and provisos which need to be halved.

The usual way out of any crisis, Jalan said, was to set up a new committee or to make a new law without scrapping the existing ones. He gave the example of the telecom sector: telecom commission, the ministry, the regulatory authority, the appellate tribunal (TDSAT) and the group of ministers. In power, there were the Union and state ministries, the Central Electricity Authority, the state boards, the Central Regulatory Authority and state authorities.

He said this ""moss"" of 50 years, if removed, would itself result in economic growth.
