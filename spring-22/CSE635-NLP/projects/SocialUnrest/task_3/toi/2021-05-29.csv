0,New govt takes charge in Karnataka,"BANGALORE: The scene was unruly, the tension among workers, palpable. But, N Dharam Singh of Congress and Siddaramaiah of JD(S) on Friday promised to bury their differences and were sworn in chief minister and deputy chief minister of Karnatakaâ€™s first coalition.

With this, Singh becomes the 17th chief minister of the state, the third backward classes representative to occupy the post. For Siddaramaiah, this is the second innings as DyCM, a post he occupied from 1996-99, in J H Patelâ€™s regime.

The duo tried to present a united front, both at Raj Bhavan and at Vidhana Soudha, but with party workers shouting slogans against each other and flexing muscles at the slightest opportunity, discomfort in the forced, uneasy coalition was evident.

Singh said: ""Siddaramaiah led agitations against us. I, as KPCC chief, led others against them. But despite political differences, we have come together to prevent growth of communal forces.""

1,Pavna bank gets RBI nod for elections,"PUNE: The Chinchwad-based Pavna co-operative bank, whose board of directors was superseded in the wake of the Industrial Development Bank of India securities scam in 2002, has been cleared by the Reserve Bank of India for conducting elections.

Highly-placed sources told TNN on Friday that the RBI clearance will be issued shortly through the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra, and elections will be held in June-July so that an elected board of directors can take charge.

A large group of banks â€” Nagpur, Wardha and Osmanabad district central co-operative banks (DCCBs), as well as the Amravati Peopleâ€™s, Raghuvanshi, Sadguru Jangli Maharaj and Suvarnayug co-operative banks â€” were embroiled in a similar Rs 260-crore Home Trade securities scam.

Pavna bank was the first among the tainted banks to recover its money, along with interest, in June last. It had paid Rs 59.22 lakh to Harischandra Gat and Company, a brokerage firm in Mumbai, for investing in IDBI-2011 bonds. The firm took the money, but failed to give the bonds to the bank, compelling the bank to file a criminal case against the bankâ€™s then chief executive officer, Krishna Kolekar, and Arvind Bhide, director of the brokerage firm.

Bhide, however, repaid Rs 59.22 lakh to the bank along with Rs 6 lakh as interest and another Rs 1.50 lakh in lieu of the expenses incurred by the bank in filing the case. The bank withdrew the case after the payments were made. Official sources said the bank has become financially healthier since then. Current deposits stand at Rs 35.07 crore, loan disbursement at Rs 22.14 crore and net non-performing assets at zero per cent. The bank earned a profit of Rs 1.13 crore in the fiscal ended March 31, 2004. Sources said the department of cooperation reviewed all the co-operative banks put under the rule of administrators from February 2002 onwards.

â€œPavna, Sri Sadguru Jangli Maharaj co-operative bank, Peopleâ€™s co-operative bank and Suvarnayug cooperative bank have done well, while Citizens, Rupee and Agrasen co-operative banks are still struggling, although we have succeeded in arresting further decline,â€� they said.

While the Jangli Maharaj co-operative bank has reduced its losses from Rs 45 crore to Rs 15 crore, the Peopleâ€™s co-operative bank has made over its loss and earned net profit. â€œRecovery from big and bulk borrowers of Rupee bank is still pending, but the bank has done well in surpassing its recovery target for 2003-04,â€� sources said, adding that, as against the recovery target of Rs 110 crore, the bank had recovered Rs 122 crore.

The Rupee bank has also succeeded in maintaining its prescribed statutory liquidity ratio and cash reserve ratio for two consecutive quarters. â€œIn fact, the bank earned operational profit during 2003-04, and its performance was much better as compared to 2002-03,â€� sources added.

Of the 12 DCCBs, which were put under â€œtroubled categoryâ€� by the cooperation department, as per section 11 of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, seven have reversed their decline.

3,"Mantra in vogue: Work hard, party harder","CHANDIGARH: It''s parties, movies, shopping and hanging out with friends...

Having done well in the first major test of their lives, Class X students are now looking forward to a noholds-barred celebration following the mantra â€˜nothing succeeds like excess''.

Madhvi Sharma of DAVPS-8, who scored 89.4 per cent, is thrilled about a â€˜â€˜richly-deserved break''''. â€˜â€˜I plan to catch up on films that I missed while I was slogging hard for the exams. Fun Republic will be the destination for me,'''' she says excitedly.

Partying has all of a sudden become the buzzword for these students, who were tensely waiting for results to be declared. Take the case of Manvi Singh of Carmel Convent, who is among the top scorers in her school with a score of 96 per cent. She says, â€˜â€˜It''s time to chill out. I plan to have a ball, though I am not yet decided on how to celebrate. For a start, I will go out with my family tonight.''''

With 92.2 per cent under his belt, revelries have just begun for Bhanuj Kappal of St John''s. He says, â€˜â€˜I have not planned anything. My celebrations will be spontaneous''''.

Splurging at shopping malls, eating out with family and friends and having a weekend blast came across as the key pleasure options for the majority of students.

However, for a section of students, things haven''t changed even a wee bit despite scoring impressive marks. Tuitions are far more important than indulging themselves, relaxing and having fun. Aditya Arora of DAVPS-8 has scored 85 per cent.

Yet, partying is not for him. He says, â€˜â€˜If I skip my tuitions for a day, I will not be allowed to attend classes the day after. Right now, the priority is to finish the Class XI syllabus. A lot of my friends haven''t planned anything after the results.''''

4,Sonia loyalists in party mood,"NEW DELHI: Perhaps for the first time, Congress president has a higher profile and greater political authority than its Prime Minister.

With this reality seeping in, the party organisation has suddenly become more important than the government for some party functionaries. A closer proximity to Sonia Gandhi is being considered by many a wiser option.

First, the loyalist brigade led by party general-secretary Ambika Soni announced its decision to remain out of the government and rally around Gandhi for the party work.

""The fundamentalist forces have been beaten, but not demolished, not yet,"" says Soni suggesting closer encounters with the BJP in near future.

Assembly elections in Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand within a year will perhaps test the party''s battle worthiness.

Then came the turn of Generation Next to show its enthusiasm about breaking its political teeth in the organisation.

""For the young MPs, it will be a great opportunity to work with the Congress president in the party,"" remarks Jyotiraditya Scindia, one of the babalog group who represents Guna in Lok Sabha.

Soni, Gandhi''s close confidant, has confirmed that young blood is being infused into the party set-up to prepare it for the future battles. ""Some of the younger elements will have a role to play in the party apparatus,"" she told The Times of India on Friday.

Giving a hint of the current thinking about the organisational revamp, she said the party structure has to be stretched up to the booth management committee to make the party''s electoral challenge more effective.

Another idea Gandhi is apparently toying with is raising a corps of trained party functionaries ready to propagate the Congress viewpoint and counter the opponents'' propaganda.

The party''s special training department is being revived to organise training camps. Gandhi''s gutsy campaign against heavy odds in the elections seems to have stressed the importance of the organisation once again.

""It''s important for us to bear in mind that the Congress president led the party upfront,"" Soni said.

The import of that struggle will have a bearing on the party when it holds organisational elections later this year. The membership drive for the party poll will accelerate now that the general election and government-making are over.

6,Naidu set to revamp party,"HYDERABAD: Conceding that there was no internal democracy in TDP, its president N Chandrababu Naidu has asserted that his first step would be to revamp, democratise and decentralise the party and prepare it for the next elections.

Naidu also admitted there was a wide gulf between the party workers and himself.

Now, I will meet you regularly till we come back to power,"" he said addressing the party cadres on the second and final day of Mahanadu on Friday.

7,HC reserves verdict in Punjab DSP selection case,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana High Court has reserved its judgement on the public interest litigation (PIL) petitions preferred against the controversial selection and appointment of some persons made by the Punjab government directly as the deputy superintendent of police(DSP) under the sports quota amid allegations of irregularities and illegalities with a view to favour some of those known to be close to the present regime ignoring sports persons with better merit, achievements and the record.

The judgement came to be reserved at the conclusion of arguments on Friday by the counsel for the petitioners and the respondents before the full bench comprising the Chief Justice Binod Kumar Roy, Justices Surya Kant and Rajive Bhalla.

The petitioners among other have sought a CBI probe into the entire gamut of selection of the persons with comparatively low merit which included among others Bikram Inderjit Singh Chahal the son of Bharat Inder Singh Chahal the media advisor to the chief minister Capt. Amarinder Singh.

Significantly, it was pointed out by a counsel for the petitioners that ban on fresh recruitment had been imposed in Punjab as per the communication of the chief secretary of February 10, while the applicants had been asked to appear before the selection committee on February 13 and 17 indicating the glaring violation of the ban by the home secretary who headed the selection committee. The counsel sought that a copy of the chief secretaryâ€™s communication intimating ban on recruitment be placed on the record.

Peacock Poaching The action to be taken against Puneet Goel an officer belonging to the Punjab civil service(PCS) who was till recently posted as the sub divisional magistrate Pathankot (Gurdaspur) and had been allegedly involved in the poaching of the national bird peacock in Hoshiarpur forest range, is under the3 consideration of the state chief secretary, the counsel for the state of Punjab informed the division bench of the Chief Justice Binod Kumar Roy and Justice Surya Kant of the Punjab and Haryana High Court during the resumed hearing on the matter which has been treated as a petition by the court itself.

The court has also sought to known how an officer allegedly involved in such an incident was given a posting regarded better than the one he held earlier. On transfer , Goel has been posted as /deputy secretary/ joint secretary in the state public works department.

In a related matter, it was also brought to the notice of the court that the security guard given to the honorary forest guard who had been responsible for discovering the poaching incident along with the killed birds from the official vehicle of the officer, could hardly be viewed as a security of any kind since the weapon given to the guard was defective due to rust and could not be put to use.

The bench has sought the response in this regard from the Punjab government while adjourning the hearing till Saturday. Cost Imposed on Haryana The division bench of Justices G S Singhvi and Nirmal Singh of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday imposed a cost of Rs.20,000(twenty thousand) on the Haryana government for its decision of December 24, 2002 to have removed Zareena as a member of the Gram Panchayat village Nangal Khurd tehsil and district Sonipat. While allowing her petition against the government decision and ordering her to be restored as a member of the panchayat, the bench has also directed that after depositing the cost the state government should recover same from the deputy commissioner concerned who had passed orders of her removal.

The deputy commissioner Sonipat had removed Zareena as her husband had allegedly been accused of grabbing some panchayat land. It was the contention of the petitioner that she could not be penalised for what had allegedly been done by her husband , especially when the authorities could very well proceed against him. Journalist murder The central bureau of investigations (CBI) has sought six months extension to complete the investigation into the murder of Ram Chander Chhatrapati a Sirsa-based journalist who had been attacked by some persons nearly two years ago. An application in this regard was submitted by Rajan Gupta the CBI standing counsel before the special division bench of the Chief Justice Binod Kumar Roy and Justice Swatanter Kumar of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday which adjourned the matter to July 13.

The high court had entrusted the probe to the CBI on the petition of Anshul Chhatrapati the son of the deceased. Some person belonging to the Dera Sacha Sauda , Sirsa are among those allegedly involved in the murder. The adjournment came after the bench had been informed that the apex court recently granted stay on the proceedings.

9,Call all party meet on drought issue: BJP,"THIRUVANANTHAPURM: The BJP on Saturday asked the Kerala government to convene an all party meeting to discuss efforts for getting drought relief of Rs.1200 crores and Rs.580 crores lapsed during 2003-2004.

Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here, party''s state unit president Sreedharan Pillai said an amount of Rs.580 crores on various account already sanctioned by the Centre during last year had not been utilised by the state due to different reasons.

The UDF partners and LDF, which backed the UPA government at the Centre, should take initiative for getting the funds through a special order, he said adding that his party would co-operate with the government in this regard.

He wanted the government to reject the fee structure for self-financing professional colleges announced by Justice K T Thomas Committee and said the new fees structure has triggered a crisis in the education filed particularly in professional courses.

To avoid further problems in the education sector, he said government should take steps to reject the committee report on fee structure.

He said the victory of NDA candidates in Muvatupuzha and Lakshawdeed had proved that BJP has gained acceptability among the minorities.

10,Lapses in UDF's policy implementation: Antony,"THRISSUR: Conceding that there had been ""lapses"" in the implementation of UDF policies during the last three years, Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony on Saturday said the failings would be rectified.

The lapses would be rectified by discussing the matters in the UDF and cabinet, Anthony told reporters here.

Antony attributed the defeat of Congress in the Lok Sabha polls to the ""dissatisfaction"" of the people in the implementation of the policy.

Antony said UDF government decided to give functional freedom to policemen with a view to avoid ""political interference"" and to ensure justice to all sections especially the weaker and poor in the society.

Majority of policemen utilized the functional freedom impartially and sincerely. But, a section of policemen, however misused the functional freedom for their personal interest which had created wrong impression among common man about the government, Antony said.

He said not only in police department, officials in some other departments like education also misused the freedom given to them.

Justice Thomas Committee report on fee structure in self financing professional colleges would be approved only after detailed discussions with all concerned, he said.

Earlier, Antony inaugurated the Kerala Police Academy''s building at nearby Ramavarampuram.

Antony also took salute at the passing out parade of 210 women police constables.

Speaking on the occasion, he said the strength of women police would be enhanced to 10 per cent of total police force.
