0,EC promises 'extraordinary steps' for fair polls,"KOLKATA: The Election Commission will take â€œextraordinary measuresâ€� to ensure free and fair elections in the state.

In keeping with the demand of Opposition parties, chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy said on Wednesday that 50 per cent of polling personnel in a district would be brought from outside the district.

Officials who know Bengali will be brought from outside the state. And Central paramilitary forces â€œwill not be confined to barracks. This is to remove the impression that the local police are biasedâ€�.

In response to complaints that sufficient time was not available to campaign because of a Pollution Control Board order banning use of microphones till April 26, he said he would ask the state to request the HC for a â€œlimited relaxationâ€� of the order.

Krishnamurthy also took note of a complaint relating to distribution of Minority Development Finance Corporation loan applications at political meetings.

â€œItâ€™s a serious allegation. I have asked for more facts,â€� he said.Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee had lodged a complaint in this regard against the CPMâ€™s Mohammed Salim.

1,"Open US market, say lawyers, CAs","NEW DELHI: Indian law degrees are not recognised in the US and an Indian lawyer in US can only practise Indian law.

""But they want to open their shops here and practise Indian law,"" says Lalit Bhasin, president of Society of Indian Law Firms and secretary-general of the Bar Association.

""This is what some of their law firms were doing in a clandestine manner four years ago until the Bombay High Court put a stop to it.""

For CAs too, reciprocity seems to be the key. ""Unless US opens its market in a true sense for Indian accountants, we should not give any concession to US counterparts to practise here,"" says Sunil Goel, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

""In fact, in maintaining reciprocity, the Indian government must ensure US opens its market in a real sense for Indians. There is no use giving us permission to operate in US market if visas are not given.""

Under WTO arrangements, the developed countries want to accelerate opening up of professional services so that they can also extend their presence to developing countries, says N V Iyer, co-chairman, Deloitte Haskins and Sells.

This matter gets complicated with local sovereignty considerations.

2,Cricket equipment sales zoom,"CHANDIGARH: The game does not just leave goodwill in its wake, it also fosters a host of content sports goods sellers.

Cricket gear constitutes as much as 75 per cent of the total daily movement of sports products in city shops. The Indo-Pak series craze is spelling hard cash for the equipment industry.

â€˜â€˜We are selling 50 to 75 junior bats a day. Along with, five to six dozen tennis balls. The softer balls allow cricket to be played just about anywhere,"" claims Harkesh Kathuria of Chandigarh Sports, Sector 17.

With the exams of the junior classes just over and the splurge of cricket across the span of media, interest in the game, and consequent equipment sales, have mushroomed. â€˜â€˜Ten to 15 team T-shirts are sold everyday. The craze is such that we even stock colours of different nations,"" continues Kathuria.

Ranging from Rs 130 to 500 vis a vis the quality of the cloth used, the apparel demand zooms the day of the match.

â€˜â€˜The culture of watching cricket in a group, especially on large screens in clubs or pubs seems to have enforced a certain dress code. Youngsters vie to dress like their stars and that translates into good sales,"" Kahuria adds.

Sunil Kathuria of Sports Corner, Sector 22, has launched a scratch card scheme to lure cricket lovers. â€˜â€˜Every buy earns the customers a card. These, in turn, yield prizes of cricket equipment,"" he says.

The response has seen him look towards extending the scheme till the end of the series. Customers have been growing with each match.

â€˜â€˜With exams ending for different age-groups as the series progresses, we expect sales to grow even more,"" opines Rajesh Bajaj, proprietor Prime Sports, Sector 7.

The emphasis is more towards glitz and customers seem indifferent to the quality of the products. â€˜â€˜The junior segment has more of kids trying to ape their stars. As such, products similar to what players like Tendulkar and Dravid sport fly off the shelves,"" Harkesh says.

Bats featuring endorsements of the better players find particular favour. The serious player segment, however, stays aloof from the spurt. The high-end products clientele has not seen any changes.

Retailers claim a 25 per cent spurt in sales since last month. As far as they are concerned the more cricket Team India plays, the better their business fortunes.

4,No grade for civic chief post: govt,"MUMBAI: The state government told the Bombay high court on Wednesday that there was no particular grade for the Mumbai municipal commissioner post.

â€œIf a secretary or a principal secretary is appointed as a civic chief, he continues to draw the same pay,â€™â€™ the stateâ€™s affidavit said.

The state was defending its choice of Johny Joseph as civic chief against two PILs, one of which was filed by former municipal chief S S Tinaikar.

Tinaikar wants Josephâ€™s appointment quashed on grounds that he was too junior for the post. The advocate general refuted the contention that only officers in the rank of additional chief secretary were appointed as civic chief.

The state listed 21 past instances where officers of the rank of principal secretary were appointed to the post, including Tinaikar himself.

5,Medha launches PPF party to fight polls,"MUMBAI: Activist Medha Patkar has announced the formation of the Peopleâ€™s Political Front (PPF), which will contest a limited number of seats either in the Lok Sabha or assembly elections.

She told newspersons here on Wednesday that the PPF has been jointly launched by different movements in the country which come under the umbrella of the National Alliance of Peopleâ€™s Movements.

Patkar said the first priority of the PPF would be to defeat the National Democratic Alliance, which is led by the â€œcommunal and fundamentalistâ€™â€™ Bharatiya Janata Party. She said the PPF was politically close to Left parties but not averse to the Congress since its strategy was to prevent the splintering of secular votes.

Patkar said no decision had been taken on whether she would contest the Lok Sabha polls against Suresh Prabhu of the Shiv Sena in Maharashtraâ€™s Rajapur constituency. Prabhu heads the task force that is implementing the river inter-linking project, to which Patkar is opposed.

Meanwhile, Patkar on Wednesday condemned the Narmada Control Authorityâ€™s decision to raise the Sardar Sarovar dam height, saying it was a violation of the election code of conduct by the Gujarat government.

Eighteen-year-old Sabyasachi Das, a student of Hare School, hanged himself at his Cossipore residence in north Kolkata, unable to bear the pressure of the impending higher secondary examinations.

Investigations revealed that Sabyasachi had done very well in his Madhyamik examinations, two years ago, and there was high expectations from him this time too.

But in the past one month, he had been telling his parents how difficult it was to meet the tremendous expectation level. According to reports, Sabyasachi used to say that the science stream of the higher secondary examination were proving to be tough for him.

Son of a WBIDC officer Masudhan Das, Sabysachi was said to be very introvert. His cousin was apparently his only close friend.

In another incident, 17-year-old Sutapa Thakur, a Madhyamik examinee, committed suicide by hanging herself in Suri on Wednesday morning.

Police retrieved a suicide note where she held four local youths responsible for driving her to suicide, additional SP (Birbhum) S K Maity said. Sutapa was supposed to get married soon after her exams. According to her note, four youths of her village broke into her house when her father was away on Tuesday night.

8,Sonal says she'll commit suicide if...,"PATNA: â€œGlobalisation means Americanism should prevail everywhere. You wear scantily-clad dresses, eat burgers and forget your countryâ€™s rich culture. If the American invasion on our culture is complete, people may ask me to perform dance, wearing such revealing clothes. That day, I will commit suicide,â€� says legendary Bharat Natyam and Odissi dance exponent Sonal Mansingh here on Wednesday.

She repeats that she will commit suicide if the American invasion on Indian culture is complete.

She said that the Indian art imbibes the elements of rich Indian philosophy whereas the western art today lacks this very thing. â€œAfter two world wars, the western culture lost its link with the past. Now what you see in western art is something which remains after the world wars. The earlier elements are lost now,â€� she said.

Sonal was all praise for the rich cultural heritage of Bihar, but she said that in recent times, something has gone wrong somewhere in the state. â€œI arrived in the state after a long time. I wanted to come here but my co-artists refused to come here. They had some bad memories of the state. I still remember when we were invited to Barauni for a show. We were ill-treated. We stayed at a dirty hotel, were provided horrible food and the train journey was a nightmare,â€� she said.

Sonal is the third woman chairperson of Sangeet Natak Academy. She said the academy is ready to provide all possible help to revive the rich cultural heritage of the state, provided the state government is willing to take initiative. She said that the secretary of the Sangeet Natak Academy, Jayant, is from Bihar and he would offer all possible help.

Sonal promised that a young musicians and a young directorsâ€™ festival will be held in the state this year.

Taking a dig at Doordarshan, she said: â€œDoordarshan has become â€˜door darshanâ€™ nowadays. It shows only distant things, something unrelated to our culture.â€� Bharat Natyam or Odissi. Which she likes more? She replies, flashing her dancing eyes: â€œThey are like my two eyes. I love both of them.â€�

She, however, admitted that the popular art form, like films, attracts people more than classical music.

â€œBut, it is nothing new. People have always been attracted to popular films. Classical music is not meant for the masses,â€� she said.

9,Taxi driver's naivete led to his arrest,"NEW DELHI: The taxi driver Jyotish Prasad, who allegedly raped the Australian tourist, was arrested probably because he was naive enough to go back to sleep at home in Shahbad village, barely a few hundred metres away from the spot where he dumped the body.

Had Prasad, who was driving a taxi registered with the Airport Authority of India (AAI), cared to escape out of the city, the police would have been left with slim chances of nabbing him.

As it turned out, the owner of the taxi had not bothered to keep a record of the antecedents of the driver. ""The union of taxi operators should have ensured that all drivers are registered with them,"" said a police officer.

That''s just the proverbial tip of the problem though. About 600 pre-paid taxis ply from the airport under the supervision of the police. Their operators pay a licence fee to the AAI.

This is over and above the taxis run by ITDC, Delhi Tourism and a private operator which happen to be more expensive.

Many pre-paid taxi drivers are averse to waiting for their chance during rush hours in the night.

They often persuade foreign tourists to travel with them without getting a slip from the pre-paid counter by offering them a concession. However, they don''t just end up charging more but also haggle for a tip.

The complicity of the booth staff cannot be ruled out as well.

""I approached the pre-paid counter when I arrived from Dubai last month. A man standing near the booth asked me for Rs 400 for Karol Bagh. The staff seemed to be acting in complicity with him. I had to insist on getting a pre-paid slip,"" said Arun Kumar Pandey, a resident of Karol Bagh.

Obviously, it''s not just the foreigners. The drivers are also known to take tourists to hotels which give them a commission.

Even before the taxi drivers, the tourists have to wade their way through a bevy of authorised loaders who actually act as touts. These touts gain entry by buying passes worth Rs 50 meant for visitors.

These men are known to harass and even intimidate passengers while ostensibly carrying their belongings. Hundreds of such touts have been arrested in the last few months from the airport.

However, all of them were released on bail as they were merely booked under the Delhi Police Act.

""The accused, most of whom are residents of adjoining villages, come back and start functioning with impunity,"" said an airport official.

Meanwhile, the CISF on Thursday denied that there was a laxity in dealing with touts at the airport.

Commandant Y N Sharma, who heads the CISF at the airport, said: ""More than 1,000 touts have been held in the last 10 months. Many errant taxi drivers have been challaned with the help from traffic police. We also have a help counter for all passengers.""

10,Autopsy rules out sexual assault,"NEW DELHI: The autopsy of Australian tourist, Dawn Griggs, has ruled out a sexual assault on her. The report, prepared by a panel of three doctors - Sarvesh Tandon, A K Sharma and Komal Singh - at Safdarjung hospital, confirmed that Griggs died due to strangulation.

Although the report is yet to be handed over to the police, the result was verbally communicated to them. For further medical test the police have, however, preserved samples from the autopsy.

The police said that the taxi driver Jyotish Prasad brutally murdered Griggs inside his taxi and also wiped off the blood stains from the car.

""Even the circumstances point towards the fact that Prasad wanted to rob her. The cleaner who was paid Rs 10 by Prasad has confirmed this,"" said a police officer.

After the Australian loaded her luggage into Prasad''s taxi the latter took a right turn towards Dwarka. Two kilometres later he drove into the jungle. Prasad stopped the car and switched off the lights.

He was aware that a police control room (PCR) van takes a round of the area. A car with its headlights on could have attracted the PCR''s attention.

With the lights off, Griggs suspected something was wrong. She started shouting for help. Scared of being caught, Prasad immediately took out a screw driver and stabbed her between the right eye and nose. The second stab was on the corner of the same eye.

Prasad did not want to leave clues in his car. He, therefore dragged Griggs''s body out. Although he wanted to take the body near the well, from where the victim''s belongings were discovered later, he could not do so.

When Prasad realised that Griggs had survived being stabbed, he then stangled her. She was then gagged and suffocated by Prasad which ultimately caused the victim''s death.

Prasad immediately robbed Griggs of her money and then dumped her luggage into the nearby 50 feet deep dry well. Within an hour of the incident, he returned to the airport.

Before parking his taxi in the queue for the pre-paid booth, he got it washed by a cleaner. Prasad knew his turn would not arrive before next evening. The police team caught him sleping at his home in Shahbad diary.

Meanwhile, a city court on Thursday sent Prasad to police custody for eight days. Metropolitan magistrate S K Sharma granted the police custody in order to facilitate his interrogation. The co-accused is yet to be arrested.

Joint commissioner of police (operations) S K Chowdhury said: ""Her body has been given to the Australian High Commission who have ascertained her address in Brisbane. They will make arrangements to fly the body back to her hometown.""

11,Safdarjung Encl residents protest over faulty bills,"NEW DELHI: Safdarjung Enclave residents have taken up cudgels against faulty electricity bills and disconnection notices sent to them in the past two months.

On Thursday, 14 residents'' associations from the area met to discuss their problems and threatened to stage a dharna.

Complaining against the unhelpful attitude of BSES and DERC, Pankaj Agarwal, a resident said, ""We have explored all avenues, whether it is complaining to the power minister, or seeking an appointment with the commission. Now we are going on strike so that our demands are heard.""

""We are served wrong bills, then teams land up every day to disconnect our electricity connection,"" he added.

MLA Kiran Walia present at the meeting said: ""If electricity charges increase by over 20% with a new meter then there is something wrong. We will request BSES to give residents time till March 30 instead of March 20 to pay their bills,"" Walia said.

Residents have demanded that meters be checked by an independent agency and a grievance redressal mechanism should be set up.

BSES CEO Rakesh Agarwal said that he would schedule a meeting with the residents'' representative immediately and settle the issue.

12,No anticipatory bail for in-laws in air hostess case,"NEW DELHI: A city court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the in-laws of an air hostess in connection with a dowry harassment case.

Neetu, 26, an air hostess with the Indian Airlines, had alleged in her complaint that she was harassed for dowry by her husband, Jitender, her in-laws and their relative, Satwanti. Jitender is employed with the Airport Authority of India.

Additional sessions judge Rekha Sharma dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Neetu''s father in-law, Dharambir Singh, mother in-law, Sushila, and Satwanti.

The complainant''s advocate, Vinod Rawat, said: ""Jitender is still absconding and the court agreed with our contention that in view of the serious nature of allegations, anticipatory bail could not be granted.""

Neetu alleged in her complaint that her husband attempted to kill her brother at INA Colony on February 28.

She also alleged that he set her parent''s Mandir Marg house ablaze the next day, when all of them had gone to a hospital.

She also alleged that he made threatening calls to their residence. She had left her in-laws'' INA Colony house in January due to marital discord.
