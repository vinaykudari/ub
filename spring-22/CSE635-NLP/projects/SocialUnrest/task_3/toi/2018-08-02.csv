0,Officers unmoved by transfer policy,"lucknow: call it the up's provincial civil service (pcs) or the lucknow civil service-- it makes no difference to those posted in lucknow for decades in gross violation of the state's transfer policy. taking a serious exception to this, the allahabad high court in its observation has described the transfers and postings as an ""industry"" in the state. no doubt, this has adversely affected the administration, admits an official. but then he does not seem to have any solution. the snags that plague the pcs cadre have rendered it divided. those able to remain in lucknow and others who just struggle to do so in vain. it is true in the case of diwakar tripathi, who at present holds the coveted post of vice-chairman, lucknow development authority (lda). now promoted to an ias cadre, tripathi began his career as a city magistrate when he joined the pcs in 1972. he held various posts in district administration here prior to his present posting. all through 29 years of service, he has almost uninterrupted stint in lucknow. whichever party came to power, he always called the shot. this is just not a case in isolation. the list is long enough. and top among these privileged pcs officers are arvind narain mishra, arun kumar chaturvedi, sunita chaturvedi, pramod kumar pandey, sp singh, atul gupta, rekha gupta, prabhat sinha, sripal verma, sambhu singh yadav, rajiv chandra, madhukar dwevedi, pn batham, ashok duggal and a host of others. all of them have been posted here for the last 10 to 20 years. similarly, a lot many officers stayed put in places like allahabad, meerut, ghaziabad and gorakhpur. thus this way the pcs cadre seems to lose its character of state service due to division on the basis of regions. interestingly, these officers have overshadowed the much-vaunted transfer policy announced by the rajnath singh government. it clearly states that no pcs officer can stay more than a decade in the same district and in the same post for more than two to three years. but the policy comes cropper when judged against the recent transfers of nearly 400 out of total 1300 pcs officers in the state. in fact, the chief minister did exactly what his predecessors had done - first announcing the transfer policy and then flouting it blatantly. the policy in fact is a total farce, observed baba hardeo singh, president of the up pcs officers'association. ""there should be rules and regulations for the transfer and postings and this should be made out with an emphasis on the career and cadre management point of view"", he added. the issue, he said, had been raised time and again with the successive governments, but all in vain. this was discussed at a high level meetings presided over by chief secretaries and agreed upon in principle to formulate rules and regulations. but it's just an empty promise, he quipped.

2,Naidu calls for stringent law to check scams,"hyderabad: throwing his weight behind the nda government on the issue of uti muddle, andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu on wednesday called for stringent laws enabling confiscation of properties of those involved in the financial scandals but disapproved of the way the issue was sought to be 'politicised'.

3,Chunna's arrest: More harm than good,"kolkata: those in tiljala's sapgachhi first lane, who were winess to the abduction of khadim's director partha roy burman on july 25, have decided to keep their lips sealed after the arrest of md. taslim, alias chunna, by the cid. ""tor naam ki (what is your name),"" a cid officer asked a boy sitting in his cigarette shop cum std booth near the abduction site on wednesday, a week after the incident. the boy simply pointed to the signboard outside. this meant that the only information he would provide was the name of the shop. on further persuation he revealed the name of the proprietor, his brother. ""tor naam ami thik bar kore nebo (i will find out your name),"" with this warning, the officer went on to the next shop. however, there, too, he met with the same fate. policemen from tiljala police station who accompanied the cid officer beckoned to the owner of a snacks corner on the opposite pavement. the man grudgingly walked over but refused to disclose much. ""it all happened very fast. by the time i got there they had picked up their victim and were already on their way,"" he said. the officer from tiljala police station, accompanying the cid officer is of no help either. ""the cid have taken up the investigation. moreover, i have joined duty only on tuesday,"" was all he said. the only people interested in the activities going on were little children, with nothing better to do. another cigarette shop owner, a few yards away pointed to the spot where all the action had taken place. ""i heard the report of a gun and got busy shutting down my shop, fearing violence. i did not see what happened,"" he told the toins. the walls on either side are covered with posters, demanding the release of their ""beloved"" chunnu. meanwhile, at around noon on wednesday, more than 3,000 residents of tijala, most of them women, took out a procession in the area demanding chunnu's release. the procession was led by his mother, praying for the well being of her son. the residents, under the banner of citizens' forum, also carried banners and a large photograph of chunnu playing football. ""chunnu is a social worker and has always stood by the residents. all the people have come out spontaneously,"" said md ibrahim, a processionist. all the tiljala police can say about the arrest is, ""the cid must have reasons for their action."" however, they do agree that it was unusual for a man with chunnu's record to organise a crime so near to his house, knowing fully well that all fingers of suspicion would point to him. ""the crime may have been committed by someone he knows,"" is all the local police manage to say.

4,"'Technology, infrastructure main thrust of industrial policy'","bangalore: industries minister r v deshpande on wednesday said karnataka was the first state in the country to introduce industry deregulation measures, as well as setting aside massive funds for infrastructure and technology upgradation. replying to a question in the legislative council by d h shankara murthy (bjp) on the new industrial policy, deshpande said the karnataka udyog mitra, which had been made the nodal agency to implement deregulation measures, would be given more powers for better coordination and discharge of functions. ""the thrust of the new policy is on hrd, infrastructure, technology upgradation and research orientation. we have set aside rs 100 crore for infrastructure and rs 5 crore for technology upgradation. there is a recession due to the overall economic slowdown, but it will pick up,"" he stated. as for concessions, deshpande said no sales tax exemption would be given for new industries except for those in the pipeline, whereas entry tax exemptions, upto 50 per cent exemption on stamp duties and subsidies for some industries were given to create a level playing field,"" he said. to a question on the global investors meet (gim) raised by m v rajashekaran (cong), b l shankar (jd), b s yediyurappa (bjp) and basavaraj bommai (jds), deshpande said there had been a delay in setting up the industries because the gestation period between signing agreements and the physical set up coming up was between 18 months and three years. ""we have devised fast track mechanism whereby instead of over 30 procedures, it has been reduced to just three. approval for industries is given within 35 days, or if nothing is forthcoming from the department, permission deemed to have been given after this period,"" he informed. of the 254 agreements signed during gim, 36 had already been started, 76 were in different stages of implementation and 119 were in the process of being approved. deshpande agreed industries were, at the moment, concentrated in and around bangalore, with over 120 approved during gim. ""we are making efforts to attract investment in other parts of the state. under the new policy we have put bangalore in `a' zone which enjoys no exemptions or concessions, and yet investors want to set up units here. how can we turn them down?"" he asked. on accusations that the government was neglecting the agriculture sector, deshpande said 26 agro-based industries had been approved leading to an investment of nearly rs 780 crore. ""the state intends to establish five food processing parks out of which the centre has granted permission to set up two in bagalkot and malur,"" he added.

5,Govt playing vote bank politics: VHP chief,"new delhi: the sangh parivar's displeasure with the bjp-led government at the centre surfaced again on thursday with vhp president vishnu hari dalmiya accusing it of indulging in vote-bank politics. speaking to reporters after appearing before the liberhan commission, the vhp president accused the bjp at the centre of appeasing minorities in pursuit of political gains, saying: ""our eyes are not closed. what have they done in the past two-and-a-half years."" dalmiya said the government had hiked haj subsidy and done other things for the minorities but had done nothing for the hindu community. ""when asked they try to explain it away by saying they are bound by being part of the nda"", he said. that, he said, was merely an excuse. taking an aggressive stance, dalmiya said to a question that the vhp and dharam sansad were sticking by their resolve to begin temple construction after shivratri in march next year, regardless of the bjp's stand on it. ""the stones are ready, so is the plan. we will begin construction after shivratri,"" he said. the vhp would begin a public awareness programme in september to cover over two lakh villages in the country to prepare people for the construction, he said. earlier, in his appearance before the commission, spent for most part explaining the antecedents of the vhp, dalmiya said the vhp had come into being to safeguard the interest of hindus which had been neglected by every government, including the present one, in their pursuit of minority appeasement. ""even today there is a big terrosrist threat to the whole of india and our government is not able to pick up the courage to put it down with a heavy hand only as part of vote bank politics"", he said pointedly. it was this policy that had sparked a hindu backlash, the vhp leader added. he said hindus had been at the receiving end of all communal riots in the country. in a written statement to the commission, the vhp leader said he wished to ""clarify the myth that the structure which was brought down by the irate kar sewaks on 6 december 1992 was really a mosque. this has been falsely propagated by the pseudo-secularists as apart of their vote bank politics."" ""the irate kar sevaks pulled down this humiliating structure even though it was a functioning temple, to pave the way for the construction of a magnificent temple of lord ram, and as a stop-gap arrangement, erected a small make-shift temple, where the existing idols could be installed,"" dalmiya said. he said it was only a ""victory monument constructed by a foreign invader after destroying the existing hindu temple at the same place only to humiliate hindus"". much as lk advani and other bjp leaders have done before the commission, the vhp leader distanced his organisation from the bjp saying the two were distinct, with contact only on a personal level between leaders and members. he admitted that the kar sewaks had gathered in ayodhya in december 1992 under the unified command of the vhp, which had been responsible for the entire logistics and operation there. later asked by a reporter if this included the demolition, dalmiya chose not to answer.

""this was bound to happen,"" said director, pg admissions, prof rs mishra. ""girls have always been more sincere and dedicated than boys, that's why they fared well in all the board examinations,"" he said. ""i will not go far, in my house itself my daughter has been a topper throughout with self studies, while my son has to be pushed for studies,"" he said. director ug admissions, prof rr singh said that with more girls on the campus, ""law and order"" situation will improve. ""this proves that the fairer sex has arrived,"" said prof nishi pandey, director academic staff college. however, now the university should look forward to constructing some more girl hostels, she suggested. there should also be more facilities like toilets and common rooms for the them. assistant proctor mallika saxena said ""it good to see girls all around, at least that would help groom boys into becoming 'gentleman'."" if one talks of statistics: in mcom girls have bagged 52 out of 102 seats, in msc (botany) there are 43 girls on 51 seats, in msc (zoology) 43 out of 53, in msc (chemistry) 52 out of 89, in msc (environmental science) 24 out of 33, in msc (plant science) 32 out of 40, in ma (composite history) 20 out of 36, in ma (education) 13 out of 16, in ma (mih) 45 out of 91, in ma (political science) 82 out 130. besides, in ma (sanskrit) girls have bagged 108 seats out 141, in ma (political science) 82 out of 130, in ma (economics) 68 out of 104, in ma (psychology) 30 out of 38 and in ma (english) 135 out of 199. in under-graduate courses too the statistics are similar, in bsc (biology) girls have dominating by occupying around 70 per cent of total 250 seats. they have also made a dent in the boys dominated bsc (maths) where the girls have occupied over 50 per cent seats. in ba and bcom too, the girls' share is between 50-55 per cent.

13,"State, teachers clash over contract","kolkata: the state government and teachers' organisations are at loggerheads on the future of lecturers who have been appointed on contract in government colleges. a section of teachers are also agitated over the issue of allowing private colleges to opt for the contractual system. on thursday, state higher education minister satya sadhan chakraborty ruled out the possibility of any improvement in the service conditions of teachers on contract. however, west bengal college and university teachers' association general secretary anil bhattacharya said that it was a matter of time before these teachers were given provident fund and annual increment. he warned that the wbcuta would probably make a formal demand for more benefits. chakraborty, however, assured that with the state public service commission speeding up the process of appointment, the need for appointing teachers on contract would go down. he described the teachers on contract as ad hoc appointees. according to him, it was clearly mentioned in their contracts that these would be terminated as soon as the psc managed to send regular teachers in the posts they were now holding. the minister also ruled out the possibility of the appointment of teachers on contract being extended to private colleges. ""we have no such plan,"" he said. bhattacharya, on the other hand, said that the wbcuta would have no objection if teachers were appointed on contract in private colleges, too, to tide over the staff shortage. according to bhattacharya, for the teaching of newly introduced subjects like microbiology, computer science and electronics, there was little choice but to appoint teachers on contract. there were few qualified teachers available for these subjects. ""candidates qualified in these subjects rarely want to take up teaching,"" he pointed out. in the state, computer science was being taught in 90 college now, two of them being government colleges, electronics in 60 colleges and microbiology in about 15 colleges. but, because of delays in psc appointments, teachers were being appointed on contract even in other subjects. contracts were also necessary because teachers appointed by the psc often did not want to posting in colleges located in outlying areas, like in north bengal. ""everyone wants a job in kolkata,"" said the minister. private colleges were often forced to appoint part-time teachers in subjects like english where there was a serious shortage of qualified teachers, bhattacharya said. often, posts could not be filled up because of the current rules of job reservation. part-time teachers were to get rs 2,000 a month, but many colleges did not pay this amount, even after increasing fees. the wbcuta general secretary said that there were about 100 teachers on contract in 15 government colleges, which had a total teachers' strength of about 1,500. in the private colleges, there were about 3,000 part-time teachers while the total number of teachers was about 12,000.
