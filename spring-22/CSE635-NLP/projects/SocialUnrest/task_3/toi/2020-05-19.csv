0,Chandigarh's per capita income goes up by 8 pc,"CHANDIGARH: State income data currently being tabulated by the UT directorate of economics and statistics points to about eight per cent growth in the per capita income (PCI) of Chandigarh for 2001-02 over the previous year. While the city's PCI at current prices stood at Rs 44,397 in 2000-01, the income per person is projected to be about Rs 47,950 for the subsequent year. The directorate is tabularising the final figures and is expected to release the results by the end of this month. The growth in PCI during 2001-02 is higher compared to the 4.68 per cent growth recorded in 2000-01. A UT administration official said the city had surpassed the national target of recording a 5 to 6 per cent increase in GDP as set down by the National Development Council. Income per person is calculated by dividing the state domestic product (SDP) with the population. The SDP or state income represents the value of goods and services produced in a state or UT and measures the changes in the level of the economic performance. State income determines the PCI and is an index of the standard of living of the people. A PCI of about Rs 47,950 for 2001-02 represents a net SDP of Rs 4,31,550 lakh. Figures compiled by the directorate also reveal that the PCI at constant prices, with 1993-94 as the base year, has gone up by about 5 per cent. PCI at constant prices does not take into account the effect of inflation. Like the previous year, the tertiary sector continues to be the main growth engine of the local economy.

1,New farming tech to help save water,"PATIALA: Farm-level experiments on a new technique of paddy plantation are on in different districts of Punjab. Experts are claiming that this new technique would help in saving around 50 per cent of the water used to irrigate paddy. Under the new technique, the paddy would be planted on edges raised parallel to each other in the fields and the crop would be irrigated through the channels between the raised edges. Patiala chief agricultural officer Balwinder Singh Sohal told Times News Network that the technique was developed by scientists from Punjab Agriculture University, after which the experiments were extended to the farm-level. Sohal said that around 20 farmers had voluntarily provided small chunks of land for carrying out the experiments. If the government grants some financial aid, the benefits accruing from the new technique would be extended to these farmers. The agriculture department is planting in these fields paddy varieties, including PUSA-44, PR-116, PR-118, Basmati 370, Basmati 386, PUSA-I, PUSA-II, PUSA-III, PUSA Sugandh-II and PUSA Sugandh-III. Sohal said he was positive that this technique would not result in decrease in yield. He claimed that the rice grains would be better in quality as the crop would get better light and air owing to proper spacing. Sohal said that the crop would be more resistant to diseases and hence the new technique would result in decrease in the use of pesticides. A progressive farmer, Gurvinder Singh, said that this technique, if it succeeds, would be very beneficial to farmers and the state's economy. ''It would reduce the consumption of power and diesel by up to 50 per cent and would help in maintaining the ground water level. We had water just enough to irrigate 14 lakh hectares of land, but now we are able to irrigate around 24 lakh hectares of land, all thanks to the improved technique,'' he said.

2,Woman lawyer demands probe,"LUCKNOW: An unsavoury controversy involving a sitting judge is brewing in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court here. It all began with rumours that over 200 lawyers had sent an application to the Chief Justice of the high court alleging that the judge favoured a woman lawyer of the court. The sitting judge later raised the issue in an open court and said that he will not hear the cases in which the woman lawyer appeared. Nothing was heard of the application until Monday, when the woman lawyer Yogita Chandra, moved an application addressed to the Chief Justice of India. Yogita has stated in the application, a copy of which has been marked to all the judges of the Supreme Court and the Allahabad High Court, that certain disgruntled persons have submitted an application to Hon'ble Chief Justice forging the signatures of more than 200 advocates, that the sitting judge favours her. Demanding an impartial inquiry into the allegations levelled against her, Yogita said she was anguished that her opponents had maligned her without giving opportunity of hearing to me and without scrutinising the truthfulness of the allegations and genuineness of the signatures of advocates on the alleged complaint. The application also refers to an ugly incident which took place on July 3, last year. Out of jealousy and ill-will some lawyers assaulted me ...within the court premises against whom I lodged an FIR and filed an application before the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh under Section 35 of the Advocates Act. The application also throws light on the goings on in the judiciary in UP. I have visualised that some lawyers, having their approach with politicians and high-ups, try to influence the judiciary and when the hon'ble judge act impartially and do not succumb to their pressure, they try to malign them. Yogita has also alleged that the office bearers of the bar associations also expect favour and special treatments from the court failing which their superiority complex is hit, then they indulge in nefarious activities to malign the concerned judge. The application says that if the practice is allowed to continue, meritorious advocates and particularly lady advocates are bound to suffer immensely. Certain persons do not want to see a lady advocate grow, Yogita says and adds that it is very easy make allegations concerning reputation and prestige of a lady advocate. She has prayed that till your lordship take a final decision in the matter the registry of the Lucknow Bench be directed that the cases of those advocates who are alleged to have signed the said complaint be not listed before the particular sitting judge. Confirming that he also had recieved a copy of the application, Dr LP Mishra, president, Avadh Bar Association, said that it was not proper for him to comment on it. As president I will take whatever action is proper at the right forum.

3,UP govt bid to hush up fertiliser scam,"LUCKNOW: The Mayawati government is apparently trying to hush up the Rs 1,200 crore fertilizer subsidy scam. The investigating agency probing the scam was disbanded four-and-half months ago. Now, the government seems disinclined to issue a GO for handing over pending cases and documents to the vigilance directorate for further probe and initiating action against the guilty. The scam was unearthed in January 2000 when the Central government noticed that the subsidy taken by 29 fertliser units in UP suddenly shot up manifold between 1998-2000. When an inquiry was ordered, special investigation branch, agricultre and economic offence wing caught 29 units siphoning off over Rs 1,200 cr in form of subsidy during the period by showing fake production and bogus supply of thousand tonnes of single super phosphate.

4,CII discusses development with Modi,"AHMEDABAD: The Confederation of Indian Industry's efforts to mend fences with chief minister Narendra Modi seem to be finally paying off. After the high-profile spat, CII director general Tarun Das had to come down to apologise. Modi finally agreed to meet CII's Gujarat officials on Friday. Ways and means to push Gujarat as an attractive investment destination and put it back on the fast track for growth were discussed during the 40-minute meeting. According to CII officials, the chief minister agreed to work with CII to draft an economic agenda for the state and has expressed his willingness to delegate a senior official for the exercise. Modi suggested that Singapore's Sentosa Island type of fun city mooted by CII be put up in or around the Science City and said efforts should be made to push religious tourism in the state by packaging it with fun tourism. CII officials said Modi also asked for inputs on development of biotechnology. The meeting assumes significance in the light of the recent cozying up of rival Federation of Chambers of Commerce & Industry with the Gujarat government. FICCI has been aggressively wooing Modi. It has put up a stronger presence in the state by moving offices from Vadodara to Ahmedabad.

5,"Explosion at Habsiguda, 1 arrested","HYDERABAD: Two persons suffered minor injuries in an explosion at Habsiguda on Monday morning. The injured persons - Narsimha and Gopal Reddy - were treated at the Gandhi Hospital and discharged. Police arrested one person, Venkat Reddy, in connection with the blast. According to Osmania University police, the explosion occurred when MCH sweeper Narsimha set fire to garbage he had collected from Street No 8 of Jaisantoshnagar Colony in Habsiguda. Narsimha and one of the colony residents, Gopal Reddy, who was watching him set fire to the garbage, received minor injuries. A Clues team was immediately pressed into service to collect samples for analysis. The officials recovered an unexploded detonator from the spot and sent it to the AP Forensic Science Laboratory for analysis. Preliminary investigations revealed that most of the waste material was thrown out by a contractor Venkat Reddy on Sunday evening, just before vacating his house. He had taken the house on rent from Gopal Reddy. Venkat Reddy had secured a drainage work contract at Habsiguda a year ago, and had finished the work a few days back. After finishing the work, Reddy went back to his native town Nalgonda on Sunday night. Investigations also revealed that Reddy used detonators for blasting rocks and two detonators were mistakenly thrown out along with the waste material. Police said that Reddy has a licence to use detonators, but has no licence to store them in the house. A case under section 337 IPC (causing hurt by an act which endangers life) and under the Explosives Substances Act was registered against Reddy, police said.

7,BJP calls for Patna bandh on May 21,"PATNA: The state BJP on Monday gave a call for Patna bandh on May 21 to protest against the increase in kidnapping cases across the state and specially in Patna which has been rocked by the abduction of a trader and a doctor within a couple of days. The state BJP has appealed to citizens to make the bandh a success to register their voice against the criminals and the powers that give patronage to the former, according to BJP state media in-charge, Sanjay Mayukh. The leader of the opposition in state legislative council, Ganga Prasad, in a statement expressed concern at the kidnapping of eminent neurosurgeon Dr Ramesh Chandra. He said that Bihar had gone completely in the hands of criminals. Anti-social elements are running a parallel government in the state, he said. He alleged that the Laloo-Rabri government has sacrificed the people of the state in lieu of criminals' support to the government. Meanwhile, the Samata Party, while supporting the ongoing agitation of doctors of the state, said it would launch a public awareness programme in support of doctors' cause.

8,Ranbaxy in deal for anti-malaria drug development,"NEW DELHI: Ranbaxy Laboratories has entered into an alliance with Geneva-based Medicines for Malaria Venture for developing affordable synthetic peroxide anti-malaria drug. Ranbaxy will replace Roche Pharma as MMV's partner to develop this drug. Roche was MMV's partner for three years. Besides pharmaceutical and clinical development, Ranbaxy will have worldwide rights for the registration and commercialisation of the product. The partners expect the new drug will reduce the malaria treatment period to three days and cost much less than available drugs. This is a chance to bring a drug to the market at a price not as high as in the West. It is commercially viable for us, DS Brar, MD, Ranbaxy said. This Synthetic Peroxide Project is one of the principal projects in MMV's current portfolio. Dr Christopher Hentschel, CEO, MMV said, Ranbaxy has expertise to discover and develop drugs from new molecules. Its presence in several African countries will help MMV to realise the mission to develop and deliver medicines to the disease endemic countries, at affordable cost. The no-profit MMV, founded in 1999, is dedicated to finding new affordable anti-malaria drugs through collaborations between the public and private sectors. Its financiers include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Exxon Mobil Corporation, World Bank and WHO. Ranbaxy expects to develop the drug in four to five years. MMV's synthetic peroxide malaria project has two molecules with potential, of which one will be taken forward, Brar said. Ranbaxy's shares closed down 0.67 per cent at Rs 638.55 on BSE.

9,Mittal hints at increase in cell tariffs,"HYDERABAD: The cellular tariffs may now undergo an upward revision, though not very significantly. In the next 10 months, the tariffs would start moving northwards and the addition may be to the extent of 10 to 20 paise per minute, Bharti Enterprises chairman and group managing director Sunil Bharti Mittal said on Monday. ''The cellular tariffs have already hit rockbottom. The current prices are a cause for concern. Some kind of tariff stability is bound to happen,'' Mittal said. The cellular players are already working on pooling up the volumes for their revenues. Though the movement in prices is only in basic denomination, the rise in 10 to 20 paise would work out for most of the companies focusing on volumes. The good news is that the airtime usage has gone up, for instance, in the post-paid category the usage has gone up from 60 to 70 minutes a month to about 200 minutes, Mittal said. Though the companies continue to incur significant capital expenditure for upgrading or expanding their networks, the cost of production per minute is going down which, in turn, is helping companies work on their tariff structures though the tariffs in the Indian market today are lowest in the world, he pointed out. Bharti, which offers Airtel-branded cellular services, plans to double its cellular subscriber base this year too. The company would have a user base of 24 million by the end of the current year and reach 70 million by 2005-06. However, Mittal said the state-owned BSNL's approach towards the cellular market was not based on a positive note. ''BSNL used the free-incoming issue to attract customers. Nowhere in the world would governments have allowed this.'' But both BSNL and MTNL have lost significantly in long-distance telephony business.

11,UP govt insensitive towards human rights: NHRC,"NEW DELHI: National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government for ""insensitivity in cases of human rights violation in general and custodial crimes in particular,"" in respect of granting relief to victims of such violation. In a strongly-worded directive to the state government, NHRC said ""it is in anguish and not in anger that we say we are disturbed by the insensitivity of the state government in cases of violation of human rights of the citizen in general and custodial crimes in particular."" Considering the response of the state in case of one Zameer Ahmed Khan, an alleged victim of police, for whom the Commission had recommended payment of Rs 20,000 as immediate interim relief, NHRC said ""it appears that the state has conveniently forgotten the observations of the Supreme Court that custodial crime is perhaps one of the worst crimes in civilised society."" ""It is an obligation of the state, to ensure that there is no infringement of the indefeasible rights of a citizen to life, except in accordance with law while the citizen is in its custody,"" the NHRC said after its full Commission meeting, headed by Chairman A S Anand. It also appears that the concerned authorities of the state government tend to overlook the purpose of grant of ""immediate interim relief"" under Protection of Human Rights Act, in spite of having been told so by the Commission on earlier occasions and the clear exposition of law on the subject by the Supreme Court, it said.

12,"R K Sharma's mother flays son, daughter-in-law","CHANDIGARH: The woes of ailed Haryana Police official and prime accused in journalist Shivani Bhatnagar's murder case Ravi Kant Sharma multiplied on Tuesday with his mother accusing him of making her sign some papers when she had gone to meet him in Tihar jail recently. The 80-year-old widow, Kamla Sharma, accused Ravi Kant and her daughter-in-law Madhu Sharma of trying to keep her away from the house she owns in Panchkula near here in Haryana. ""My son made me sign some papers when I met him in Tihar jail. His attitude towards me was not very good...later when he had come to Panchkula in connection with his daughter's marriage I told him to ask Madhu to vacate the house, but he did not give a positive reply,"" Kamla told reporters here. She accused Madhu Sharma of ill-treating her. ""She has forcibly occupied my house which my husband G D Sharma had left in my name. Whenever I go there Madhu and her daughter Komal treat me badly. Several times I told Madhu to vacate my house, but she never listens and rebukes me,"" Kamla, who now lives with her daughter Sudha Joshi, said. Saying she had suffered two heart attacks in the recent past, Kamla said she did not want to take legal action against Madhu or Ravi Kant to get her back house. ""I don't have any strength left in me. However, if they don't vacate my house, I will be writing to Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, Haryana Police DGP and to Prime Minister and urge them to help restore my house to me,"" she said. Kamla said the house - Govind Niwas - had been constructed for her in 1978 by her husband who expired in 1999. Kamla Sharma alleged that the Fixed Deposits and some certificates amounting to Rs 2.5 lakh which were in her name had also been taken away from her by Madhu and Ravi Kant Sharma. She said she was forced to live with her daughter at Manimajra here. Kamla said she has two sons and two daughters, out of whom R K Sharma and Sudha were residing in India while two others were abroad. Asked whom she would stay with if her Sector six house at Panchkula, which had hogged the headlines about a year back in connection with R K Sharma's alleged involvement in Shivani murder case, was restored to her, Kamla said her neighbours would be her family. ""I will be happy to pass my last days in peace with them (neighbours). I don't want anyone else there,"" she said. Asked if she had ever known about R K Sharma's alleged involvement with Shivani, she said she was never aware of it. However, she said her husband had taken the news with great pain when the name of his son figured in the Shivani murder case. Surcharged with emotions, when a journalist asked her that did she ever suspect that her son could be involved in a murder, she said, ""I think Madhu Sharma is behind it (the Shivani Bhatnagar muder)."" Madhu Sharma was not available for comments at the Sector six residence, as guards told reporters that she had gone out of station.

13,Army increasing anti-insurgency deployment near LoC,"NEW DELHI: As Islamabad on Tuesday claimed to have imposed restrictions on militant groups operating in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, army is increasing its anti-insurgency deployment to strengthen certain key areas near the Line of Control to maintain pressure on terrorists.

14,"Habib Miyan: Age 132, pensioner since 1938","JAIPUR: Rahim Khan, a clarinet player of the erstwhile Jaipur state forces band, celebrated his 132nd birthday on Tuesday. He is fondly called Habib Miyan by his great-grandchildren and neighbours. An officer of the State Bank of India, which gives him a pension, says a first class magistrate of Jaipur had certified that Habib Miyan was born on May 20, 1878. The basis of the certification was Habib Miyan's pension records. Therefore, going by the magistrate's certificate, Habib Miyan is 125 years old. Scores of great grandchildren wished Habib Miyan a happy birthday at his small dingy room in a colony here. Soon, the neighbours joined them with garlands in their hands. Habib has been receiving pension since 1938. Initially, the amount was Rs 2 per month. Over the years, the amount went up to Rs 2,300. There are many who dispute Habib Miyan's age, but he just laughs at them. SBI branch manager (Transport Nagar) Paritosh Tripathi said, ''We deliver the pension at his home as a humane gesture as there is no other person, at least in the SBI's record book, who had been drawing pension for over 65 years now. He is a very special customer for us.'' Habib Miyan lost his vision 50 years ago. But he has no hearing problem. ''I really don't know how I survived so long. Many of my grandsons and granddaughters and their offsprings, too, have died. I am staying with my brother's great-grandchildren and they look after me well. ''I spend my time offering prayers. I wonder why people doubt my age. I try to convince them by telling them about how the Maharajas of Jaipur ascended the throne and died, and how the coronations took place. Jaipur has grown or rather overgrown, but I have not been able to see anything after losing my vision.'' His last wish is to go to Haj. But he wants a sponsor.

15,Trade Union bandh unlikely to affect city,"MUMBAI: With Shiv Senacontrolled trade unions unwilling to participate in the Left-sponsored all-India bandh scheduled on Wednesday, normal life is unlikely to be affected in Mumbai, Thane and other nearby regions. In any case, the railways, BEST buses, taxis and autorickshaws have all been exempted from the strike and drivers will ply their vehicles in regular numbers, according to Sharad Rao, who controls the Mumbai Municipal Union (MMU) and other labour organisations. Even in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, only non-essential sections will strike work, which means that emergency services, like hospitals and the fire brigade, will remain unaffected, Mr Rao said. University of Mumbai officials said exams scheduled for Wednesday will be held and L K Agnihotri, the controller of examinations, Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, said all medical exams would also be held on schedule. The Sena's non-participation has also resulted in deep cracks appearing in the redsaffron alliance, formed in the larger interests of the proletariat. The one-day Bharat Bandh is the Left unions' protest against the Centre's antilabour'' reforms, an issue that has stirred the Sena to hum the Marxist melody in the past. However, former MP Madhukar Sarpotdar, who heads the federation of Sena-controlled trade bodies, told TNN on Monday, This time around, the Left leaders did not consult the Sena. They, in fact, unilaterally announced the bandh plan. We have no other alternative but to stay away from their agitation. But we will not sabotage the bandh as we believe in the solidarity of the working class.'' Ramakant More, chief of the Bharatiya Kamgar Sena, the Sena's union flagship, told TNN on Monday, We will extend moral support to the bandh, but there is no question of participating in it.'' Mr Sarpotdar said discussions with Left trade unionists last week were infructuous'', as they came to us after having finalised everything. The Left combine has its share of strength and we wish it all the best. However, if they talk of the unity of the working class, then they should have taken the Senacontrolled unions into confidence before finalising the bandh,'' he added. Earlier, in April 2001, the decks had been cleared for the Sena's participation in a nationwide industrial strike after talks between Left trade unionists and Sena chief Bal Thackeray. The combined operation of April 2001 had brightened hopes of the ideological opposites fashioning out a broader programmatic unity in the interests of the working class''. The Sena has under its belt 62 trade unions, which cut a swathe across a range of sectors, including aviation, hospitality, banking, textile, insurance and engineering. The party thus has an edge over the Left, particularly in Mumbai, where the BKS and Sthaneeya Lokadhkiar Samiti boast an impressive following. Meanwhile, the Sena plans to gather more steam'' with the Centre on the issue of labour reforms. A high-level delegation of Sena trade unionists held talks with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in New Delhi last month on a range of issues, including disinvestment and amendments to labour legislation. In a memorandum to the prime minister, the Sena suggested immediately dismantling the Board of Industrial Finance and Reconstruction and a review of the Centre's disinvestment policy, it is learnt. A resolution opposing Voluntary Retirement Schemes, the rampant disinvestment of PSUs and the Centre's antilabour'' reforms was unanimously passed at the behest of Mr Thackeray at the Sena's Mahabaleshwar conclave in January this year.

16,No action against Sena protesters,"MUMBAI: The police seem to have taken a soft stand against Shiv Sainiks who demonstrated outside the Warden Road residence of ad man Alyque Padamsee on Monday afternoon. The Gamdevi police have still not registered a case against the 150-odd demonstrators. The Sainiks were objecting to Mr Padamsee calling Mumbai as Bombay. The demonstration was said to be part of the Sena's 'Mee Mumbaikar campaign.' An officer from the Gamdevi police station said the police had recorded the incident and were conducting inquiries.'' Asked why no case was registered, he replied that a demonstration was held inside a private property and the police had not received any complaints against the Sainiks from the residents. There was no violence or breach of peace'', he said. The Shiv Sena had intimated to the police about their meeting with Mr Padamsee,'' the officer said. The police claim that the number of demonstrators was quite less than what was being claimed by the Sena. It may be recalled that the Sainiks dispersed only after taking a written apology from Mr Padamsee.
