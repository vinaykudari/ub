1,Punjab govt proposes to create conducive climate for industry,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab proposes to create a conducive investment climate through infrastructure creation, reduced regulations and general facilitation in order to rejuvenate the sagging industry in the state.

Director, industries, SK Sandhu, addressing a seminar on industrial development in the region at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development here on Saturday, harped on various aspects of the new industrial policy released by the state government this month and said special effort would be focussed on making competitive existing industry, particularly in the small scale sector, through improved technology, product quality and marketing.

He said the state industries were poised for a stiff challenge in view of trade liberalisation and the new industrial policy would ensure direct financial incentives in form of subsidies and tax exemptions or deferment to infuse new life in industries. Sandhu said effort would be made to create special thrust in areas where Punjab had an edge in terms of cost and competitiveness. He said the new policy proposed to open a new chapter for the industries in the state. Sandhu discounted speculations about the possible shifting of industrial units from Punjab to Himachal Pradesh in view of new concessions granted by the centre for the hill state saying that the concessions were meant for new units. Moreover the facilities and infrastructure provided by Punjab was far better than what the neighbouring states, he contended.

Chairing the seminar Dr SP Gupta, member, Planning Commission, lauded the Punjab governmentâ€™s efforts to do away with â€˜â€˜inspector rajâ€� in industries, but said that industrial development had failed to take place at desired pace because of inadequate infrastructural facilities, particularly power supply. Gupta said there was a need for paradigm shift in the approach to industrial development. He cautioned that Punjab, with increasing rate of literacy, faced a peculiar challenge of increasing unemployment with very few jobs being created for the local youth.

Gupta said in view of liberalisation and globalisation it would be necessary to review the existing industrial policies and related institutional mechanisms with a view to bring about a more dynamic approach to attract private investments and to establish industries with high growth potentials. Rashpal Malhotra, director of CRRID, stressed on the need for a wider debate on the planning commission document, â€˜â€˜India Vision 2020â€�. He said Gupta, who had been a guiding force behind the document, had provided great insight into the emerging technological and social changes and their potential to make India a strong viable globally integrated economic power.

2,Tada court turns down govt. appeal on Kalani,"PUNE: Designated Tada court judge N.M. Gilani on Saturday rejected the state governmentâ€™s application to drop Tada charges against Ulhasnagar MLA Pappu Kalani.

The rejection by the court, which is the first of its kind in the state, is being seen as a slap on the face of the government by many legal experts in the city. The state government had appointed a committee to review all Tada cases in Maharashtra, as per the directions by the supreme court last year. The committee had recommended dropping of Tada charges against Kalani.

Accepting the recommendations, the state government decided to drop the charges against Kalani. An application to this effect was moved by special public prosecutor Nitin Pradhan in Gilaniâ€™s court last week. However, Manda Jadhav, wife of Maruti Jadhav, who has been allegedly murdered by Kalani, objected to the state governmentâ€™s decision.

In an order, Gilani observed that the state governmentâ€™s recommendation to drop the charges against Kalani would neither serve any public interest or advance the cause of justice. â€œThe supreme court has already observed that both the Jadhav and Anna Shetty murder cases fit into the definition of Tada as given by the law,â€� he said.

The judge also observed that the confessions of the accused persons are admissible pieces of evidence under Tada and these confessions clearly revealed how plans to murder Shetty and Jadhav were hatched and hence it was difficult to drop the charges against Kalani.

It might be recalled that Kalaniâ€™s uncle, Dunichand Kalani, who was the president of Ulhasnagar Taluka Congress Committee, was murdered on April 9, 1989. Subsequently, the two accused, Jadhav and Shetty, were murdered in 1992 by the Kalani gang. Kalani was booked under Tada and was lodged in the Yerwada jail till 2001, when he was released on bail.

3,5 arrested in attack case on PCMC leader,"PUNE: In a significant breakthrough, the Pune police have taken into custody five persons suspected to be involved in a dacoity at the residence of Yogesh Bahal, leader of the ruling party, in the Pimpri-Chincwhad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) on Saturday.

Commissioner of police A.N. Roy confirmed that the police had taken five people, suspected to be involved in the attack, into custody. However, he said that he would be in a position to give more details on Sunday. He said that robbery was the main motive behind the attack. It may be recalled that, on March 5, unidentified men broke into the residence of Bahal in the wee hours and killed his brother Rajesh and critically wounded Rajeshâ€™s wife, Nilima, with a cricket stump and then fled the scene with Rs 30,050.

On the murder of BJP corporator Satish Misal, he said that there was no significant progress in the case. Roy added that the conspirators were known to the police and business rivalry and not extortion was behind the murder. â€œThere were as many as four assailants who attacked Misal,â€� he said.

When asked if Misalâ€™s death would affect the investigation, he said the police were not dependent on him for investigation. Meanwhile, Misalâ€™s car driver, Santosh Bhalerao, who was undergoing treatment in a hospital, was discharged on Saturday.

5,It's a Chinese riot this Holi for kids,"LUCKNOW: It promises to be a â€˜differentâ€™ Holi for the kids this season. With Chinese-made â€˜Shaka-laka-boom-boomâ€™ water cannons (pitchkaris) hitting the market, kids can now look forward to painting more than just the town, in the colour of their choice.

With shops flooded with Chinese-made pitchkaris in the form of musical guns, dinosaurs, dragons, penguins and fishes, and even â€˜Gauri missile sprinklersâ€™ and â€˜superpower 400 missile sprinklersâ€™, its chow chow time alright. And for those caught up in cricket fever, there is an array of world cup sprinklers to choose from. Of course, these sprinklers can set you back by up to Rs 500, but then, which parent would want to spoil the fun?

Warsi Toys of Aminabad, which has stocked its shelves with Chinese goods since the past three years, has goodies which can set you back by up to Rs 1,300. â€œPeople come and buy Chinese sprinklers because these products are of a superior quality. The finishing is excellent and they are cheaper than their Indian models too,â€� says the shop owner. Even the guns and missiles sold here, are exact replicas of the real ones, claims the shopkeeper.

â€œIndian water cannons are not even asked for,â€� said the shopkeeper of Malhotra Stores in Aminabad. The gulals donâ€™t appear to be lagging far behind either. From the desi to arrowroot and even the herbal gulals, the range on sale promises to make your face light up. The desi gulal comes for Rs 20 a kilo, whereas the arrowroot gulal can cost up to Rs 5 per 100 gm of colourful fun. The herbal gulal, which is new to the market, costs up to Rs 15 for 100 gm.

Explaining the harmful effects of chemical gulals, Dr VP Kapoor, an National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) scientist, said that chemical gulals are made from banned or harmful dyes, which result in a burning sensation when applied on oneâ€™s skin. The chemical gulal also causes rashes and allergies. NBRI came out with a herbal gulal, which hit the market last Holi, and now other companies like KK (Krishna Kumar) are following suit, selling their own brand of herbal gulal. This eco-friendly gulal is made from vegetable dyes and is even soothing when applied on the skin, owing to its low granulation and natural ingredients.

6,Traders strike to protest against VAT,"KOLKATA: Traders in the city chose Saturday, the National Consumersâ€™ Day, to observe a bandh to press for their demands.

All shops and business establishments remained closed in protest against the hike in electricity charges, the imminent implementation of the valueadded tax (VAT) system and the alleged discrepancies in trade licence fees. ""I have been trying to find a grocery shop to buy some things for a party at my home this evening. After driving around the city from Gariahat to Manicktala, I found none open. Now, I will have to cancel the party as itâ€™ll be too expensive to order all the food,"" said Chaiti Ghosh from Ballygunge. ""Itâ€™s incomprehensible. I read about the Consumersâ€™ Day in the newspapers and was expecting a more polite behaviour from traders.

But it is ironic that they have chosen this day to inconvenience customers,"" Rajat Saha of Beliaghata said. The 24-hour strike was called by the Joint Committee of West Bengal Trade Bodies. The JTBWB will also organise a march to Assembly on March 25 and present a memorandum to state finance minister Asim Dasgupta. Though the committee had discussed its problems with Dasgupta, the latter has not yet made any concessions on the VAT issue.

VAT is likely to be introduced from April 1. Talks with civic bodies including the Kolkata Municipal Corporation on a uniform rate for trade licence throughout the state have also not got any response.

7,One shot dead in Muharram violence,"PATNA: One person was shot dead while two others, including a music band member, received bullet injuries following a violent clash between two groups of people taking out Tazia processions on Ashok Rajpath near the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) on Saturday evening. The processions were on their way to the Dargah area in Patna City.

The deceased has been identified as Riyaz. The injured have been admitted to the PMCH.

When contacted, city SP O N Bhaskar said the incident was not related to the Muharram processions. The incident took place in a lane off Ashok Rajpath, he maintained. A case has been lodged on the basis of the statement made by the deceased Riyazâ€™s brother. According to Bhaskar, one of the injured is a close relative of the deceased.

According to the police, trouble began when two groups of people from the Dujra and Karbigahiya areas taking out Tazia processions clashed near the PMCH in the process of overtaking each other. Locals said people in the processions also lobbed at least three bombs.

Senior police officers and a team of the district administration arrived at the spot with additional reinforcement. But the processions had moved away. It took more than an hour for the administration to locate the deceased and two others.

8,Engineers not to celebrate Holi in protest,"PATNA: The engineers of Bihar will not celebrate Holi this year in protest against the kidnapping and killing of a large number of engineers in the state. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the Engineering Service Coordination Committee here on Saturday.

Talking to mediapersons, committee president Gopal Narayan Singh said with the recent kidnapping of Rohit Kumar Jha and

Kedar Nath, the total number of engineers missing or killed in the state has gone up to 72, adding that these incidents have made the wife, children and other relatives of every engineer posted in Bihar fear for his safety.

Singh said a symbolic â€œfuneral processionâ€� will be taken out to Raj Bhavan on March 22 in which there will be 72 â€œarthisâ€� representing all the kidnapped or murdered engineers. This will be followed by complete stoppage of water and power supply in the state from March 28, he added.

He said the situation has deteriorated so much so that one cannot be sure of returning home safe when one goes to work in morning due to the rising crime graph. The police entrusted with the job of providing protection to the people have become inactive as a result of which the number of crimes is going up, he maintained.

Singh said all their efforts to get the kidnapped engineers rescued have proved futile. â€œHow can we celebrate the festival when our colleaguesâ€™ families are passing through a severe trauma?â€� he asked.

The Power Junior Engineersâ€™ Association has extended its unconditional support to the agitation programme of the committee.

9,'Mulund blast was aimed at sparking communal riots',"MUMBAI: The explosion on a suburban train in Mulund on Thursday nightâ€”the fourth in the last three monthsâ€”was aimed at provoking communal violence in the metropolis, officials in the security agencies claimed.

They alleged that since the first blast near Ghatkopar railway station on December 2, Pakistan''s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) had been trying to spark violence in the city through front organisations such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Students'' Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).

""There cannot be any other motive behind these blasts which are significantly not aimed at political targets, but at innocent people, including women,"" a police official said. ""It is to the credit of the people of Mumbai that they have not fallen for the bait.""

It is learnt that the state government has informally appealed to parties and organisations such as the Shiv Sena and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad not to complicate the situation by issuing provocative statements.

Although SIMI does not have a mass base in the city, it has the capacity to create trouble, officials said. The police on Friday night rounded up a few persons from Ghatkopar and Saki Naka for questioning in connection with the Mulund blast.

SIMI is believed to have a number of full-timer membersâ€”called ''ansars''â€”who are active despite a ban on the organisation. Railway police commissioner Rakesh Maria said his team had some leads in the case.

He said that forensic reports state that the explosive contained a mixture of ammonium nitrate, potassium chlorate and sulphuric acid. It was kept in a container and triggered with a timer device.

During preliminary investigations, the police had said that the explosive had been placed on the rack of a women''s first-class compartment. But forensic experts said that the bomb was planted on the rack in the adjacent second-class general compartment.

Crime branch officials said that a team had drawn a sketch of a suspect on the basis of eye-witness accounts. ""A person had alighted from the train in a hurry at Ghatkopar station,"" a senior police officer said. ""This person even had an argument with a passenger who was blocking his way while getting out of the train.""

Police commissioner Ranjit Sharma has proposed to the state government that a special squad within the Mumbai police should handle all terrorist strikes in the city. ""The proposal is being considered by the government,"" Mr Sharma told mediapersons on Saturday.

He said the government had already sanctioned a quick response team,which would be set up in a week. The team and the special squad commandos will coordinate with state and central intelligence agencies and focus on organisations like the LeT and SIMI.

In case of future blasts, the scene of the crime will be out of bounds for politicians, mediapersons and even officers from other intelligence departments until the squad picks up all vital clues from the spot, Mr Sharma said.

A crime branch officer said that the police had failed to pick up any vital clues from the mangled compartment of the Mulund train because a large number of press photographers, politicians and even policemen had touched the interior of the compartment.

ISI using Lashkar, SIMI to foment trouble in city, say intelligence officials Police round up a few persons from Ghatkopar and Saki Naka Sketch of suspect drawn on basis of eye-witness accounts

10,Vasavi bank scam accused alleges political vendetta,"HYDERABAD: Even as the 13 present and former directors of the Vasavi Cooperative Urban Bank were remanded to judicial custody on Saturday, one of the accused, G Rajamouli Gupta, termed it as political vendetta.

Talking to reporters before being taken to the Chanchalguda Central Prison, Rajamouli Gupta, who is the general secretary of the All-India Arya Vysya Samaj, said the arrest was part of a ""political ploy"".

""Unlike others who fled just before a few cooperative banks crumbled, we have expressed our readiness to repay the money borrowed from the bank. Despite our assurance, the police arrested us as part of a political game plan,"" Rajamouli Gupta said.

He, however, refused to name those behind the alleged political game plan.

Rajamouli Gupta, considered a staunch Congress supporter, had recently organised Vysya Sankharavam, a meeting of Vysyas where the speakers demanded greater importance for the Vysya community in politics, with an eye on the next elections.

Incidentally, senior Congress leader K Rosaiah and the managing director of a Telugu daily had met the accused on Friday and also the CID officials reportedly seeking a ''compromise''.

The accused were produced before the metropolitan sessions judge G V Seethapathy at Nampally criminal courts complex at around 10.30 am on Saturday who ordered them to judicial custody till March 28.

11,Knowledge must power development: Kalam,"HYDERABAD: President A P J Abdul Kalam on Saturday said knowledge must power rural development as it will transform the country into a knowledge superpower.

Speaking after releasing the software ''Reading Aid for the Visually Impaired'' at a function organised by the International Institute for Information Technology (IIIT) here, he said that minimum requirement for this feat would be high bandwidth rural connectivity to take education, health care and economic dynamism to rural India.

Knowledge must be the primary production resource instead of capital and labour, he added. Kalam said, if IT could address problems of the visually-impaired people, it would be great as they would have an equal urge for studies.

The aid allows the computer to speak out what was on the screen. As the inability of a blind person disables him from reading e-mail, documents, Web pages and others, the text-to-speech technology is used to bridge the gap, IIIT director Rajeev Sangal said.

Such solutions exist for English. IIIT Hyderabad with funding from Satyam Computers had developed a text-to-speech engine for Hindi and Telugu too, he added. It would produce comprehensible speech with natural quality, he said.

Congratulating the team, Kalam said that the networking of institutions would be beneficial for the IIIT and called upon students of the institute, who had an interactive session with him to think big and set higher goals.

The president also launched a joint programme of IIIT and CARE Foundation on robotic surgery, where the faculty and students could avail the facility of robotic surgery for research and analysis.

Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said the state was determined to be one of the foremost knowledge societies in the world.

""In a knowledge economy, we need institutions of excellence in education and research and development,"" he said.

""Recognising this, the government is also planning to establish an institute of life sciences, besides Sylvan is building a world-class educational campus in Hyderabad,"" he said. The state had 220 engineering colleges with 65,000 seats as compared to just 32 engineering colleges with less than 8,000 seats in 1995, he said.

14,Has govt gone soft on tuitions?,"LUDHIANA: Last year, the very mention of private tuitions would send a chill down many spines. Should teachers of governmentaided schools be barred from giving tuition â€” was what the debate had been about. Teachersâ€™ associations had never been ready to comply with the order right from the start. Many dharnas were also staged in the state in protest against the ban.

Teachers had been picked up during vigilance bureau raids. Many teachers fearing that they would not escape the long arm of the law had shut down their practice. â€˜â€˜A government teacher giving tuitions is no more a cause for raising eyebrows, as it had been a few months ago,â€™â€™ says Beena Rao, an educationist, who strongly opposes the practice.

Recently appointed Punjab education minister Harman Das Johar, on Saturday, said that he was fairly new to the ministry, and would require a fortnight to go through the data, before being able to reply to queries of the media. District Education Officer (Ludhiana) Bachittar Singh, on the other hand, said that once teachers from Government College of Boys and Arya College, besides some schools were nailed, the others realised that giving tuitions was not really worth it. He said the only reason that the subject is no longer in the news is because teachers are no longer giving tuitions. Bachittar Singh added that the practice still continued in private schools, but in government-aided institutes the menace had been wiped out.

The DEO, nonetheless, went on to add that presently final examinations were underway and they would find out only in May if teachers are continuing with the practice. A student who featured on the merit list this year told Times News Network, â€˜â€˜The syllabus is never completed in the classroom. Moreover, if you want that extra edge, you need private tutors.â€™â€™
