0,Pota court seeks list of lawyers,"AHMEDABAD: The special Pota court on Tuesday directed the registrar of the city civil court here to place before it a list of lawyers on the legal aid panel so that they can be engaged for the 23 Godhra accused who are yet to find a counsel for themselves.

Special judge Sonia Gokani passed the order observing that as most of the accused are undertrials, lodged in jail for more than 18 months now, it would be desirable to proceed with trial without further delay. Charges would be framed once the procedure is completed.

Maulvi Ibrahim Hasan Haji Umarji, alleged to be the prime conspirator of the Sabarmati Express carnage, assured the court that he would engage a lawyer by the fourth week of August. The court said that â€œsufficient time has been already made available to the accused in the course of the last two-and-a-half monthsâ€�.

The directions came following a submission by an advocate appearing for many of the accused that it was not certain as to how long it would take these 23 accused to arrange lawyers for themselves.

Directing that the 23 accused be provided legal aid, the court also held that the accused were at liberty to engage private lawyers at any stage of the trial â€” in case they are able to arrange one for themselves. The court said that it was dutybound to provide legal aid for the accused considering the seriousness of the case and â€œsenior advocates from the bar shall be considered for being appointed as defence lawyersâ€�.

1,Engine derails at Chinchwad,"PUNE: A CSM railway engine belonging to the Pune division, which is used in track ballast operations, derailed near the Chinchwad station rail yard at 3.55 pm on Monday.

Although there was no disruption in rail traffic, passengers and senior citizens had a tough time boarding the Pune-Lonavla-Pune local trains between 4 pm and 6 pm because the trains ran on main railway lines.

Danny Thomas, a daily commuter, said some senior citizens found it difficult to board the local trains due to the height between the train doorway and the main tracks.

Pune divisional traffic manager Brijendra Kumar said, â€œWe had to divert some of the Pune-Lonavla-Pune local trains on the main express train lines, near the Chinchwad station. However, we had made arrangements for senior citizens to board the trains. Likewise, we made frequent announcements of the same on the public address system.â€�

The CSM engine was put back on the railway track by 6.16 pm, he added.

2,2 more farmers end lives,"MANDYA/HASSAN: Unable to repay their debts, two farmers, one in Mandya and the other in Hassan, ended their lives, the police said on Tuesday.

K.S. Ramesh (24), a farmer of Karadakerein, Maddur taluk, hanged himself here on Monday. According to the police, Ramesh had to repay Rs 80,000. This included the amount incurred by his brother Shivalingaiah. Worried about the repayment, he had confined himself to the house since the last four days.

This is the second suicide by a farmer in Mandya. Last week, Hanumegowda of Bidarahosalli consumed pesticide since he was unable to clear his debts.

In Hassan, a farmer from Chanarapatna taluk ended his life. The police said on Saturday, Krishnaegowda of Chaudanaehalli consumed pesticide. He was rushed to the Adichunchanagiri Hospital at Bellur in Mandya district. However, he succumbed on Tuesday, the police added.

3,"'New molecular designs inspired by instinct, nature'","PUNE: The molecular carbon cages called Fullerenes are expected to have uses in drug delivery to check HIV, as superconductor material and as micro-lubricants.

The geodesic dome designed by renowned architect Buckminster Fuller inspired the discovery of spherical carbon molecule Fullerene C-60 and ushered a revolution in molecular design.

The geometrical pattern of a bunch of Walnut fruits on a tree or cannonballs stored symmetrically by Napoleonâ€™s soldiers can inspire newer designs of molecules, said Govardhan Mehta, the director of Indian Institute of Science.

He was delivering the National Chemical Laboratory research foundationâ€™s Prof K Venkataraman memorial lecture on Tuesday in Pune.

Well, what other familiar and not so familiar things are inspiring scientists to strive for newer molecular structures?

Mehta pointed out that ladders and bowls are the shapes scientists are trying to emulate in molecular design.

He said that experiments were successful in creating ladderenes (ladder-shaped molecules). In a rare case of human intuition anticipating molecular structures already existing in nature, Mehta said, â€œNearly ten years later, the first natural ladderene molecule was isolated form the anammox bacteria as reported in the recent issue of Nature.â€�

Ladderenes are considered to be excellent, rigid, modular spacers for energy and electron transfer and thus find application as conductors in electronics. Ladderenes are created by oligomerisation of square-shaped cyclobutadienes.

Mehta also elaborated a number of strategies to create bowl-shaped molecular structures. Mehta asked, â€œWhy not slice the fullerene with a knife?â€� Symmetry-driven slicing could create hydro-carbon bowls.

He also explained a three-step strategy of using Wittig Reaction, electrocyclisation and thermal activation would lead to bucky-bowls.

Scientists have conducted various experiments to create bowl-shaped molecular design but without success so far.

He said the young scientists should boldly explore new and exciting molecular design possibilities, seeking inspiration from nature and human instinct.",PUNE
4,"23 years, 15 probes and govt inaction","BANGALORE: As many as 15 commissions of inquiry. Eleven reports accepted. Action taken in only two instances. All this in 23 years. And the cost? Rs 3 crore.

For successive governments in the state, the formula has been simple: when in trouble order a probe. Be it a riot or a case of corruption, when it comes to political fire-fighting nothing works as well as setting up a commission of inquiry. As for action, once the heat is off, who cares.

Take for instance, the communal clashes that rocked Bhatkal in 1993, which left 17 dead and 90 injured. The government ordered a judicial inquiry. Justice K. Jagannatha Shetty who headed the Commission, submitted his report, but to date it has not been tabled in the legislature.

In another case, the police opened fire on a â€˜violentâ€™ mob in February, 1997, at Hejjala in Ramanagaram taluk in Bangalore rural district resulting in the death of three persons. The Justice D.P. Hiremath Commission indicted the police. But no action has been taken.

Only two reports have been tabled in the legislature so far. Everything is so hush hush that a government, which trumpets about â€˜transparencyâ€™, did not even furnish the list of Commissions constituted till date to this newspaper. When this correspondent approached additional chief secretary (home) Adhip Chaudhuri, he was told that the list is â€œnot giveable for various reasonsâ€™â€™.

Former law minister M.C. Nanaiah pointed out that reports are put on the back burner as the term of the Commissions is extended several times. â€œIt is also because of the sensitive nature of the findings,â€™â€™ he added.

â€œBy the time, a judicial commission completes its work, the party which ordered the inquiry is often out of power. And the issue is put in cold storage,â€™â€™ he stated. This year the state government extended the term of two commissions: the Justice R.G. Vaidyanatha Commission probing the circumstances leading to the death of former minister H. Nagappa in the captivity of forest brigand Veerappan and Justice Mohammed Anwar Commission probing the death of farmer Guruswamy, who jumped into the Kabini river during the Cauvery agitation.

A minimum of Rs 13 lakh is spent on each Commission. The highest spent so far was on the Justice D.P. Hiremath Commission (Rs 41.49 lakh). However, law and parliamentary affairs minister D.B. Chandre Gowda does not believe that this is a drain on public money.

â€œIn fact, inquiry commissions are of immense assistance to the government. The report findings give a very clear picture on any incident. Even if the report is not implemented, the recommendations are useful for corrective actions,â€™â€™ he added.

5,VHP bandh evokes poor response,"HAJIPUR: The bandh call given by the VHP on Tuesday failed to evoke any response at Hajipur. Vaishali SP Shobha Ohatker said that about 24 VHP volunteers were arrested as soon as they arrived at Gandhi Chowk.

The schools, offices and business establishments remained open. Three injured: Three people were injured in a bus-truck collision at the Mahatma Gandhi setu on Tuesday. The injured were admitted to the Sadar hospital here. Traffic at the bridge remained blocked for some time following the accident.

6,CPI-ML rues treason charge against party activists,"PATNA: The CPI(ML) has decried the government move to charge its activists with treason for showing black flags to the deputy prime minister L K Advani in Darbhanga and said that it was highly anti-democratic.

Member of the Central Committee of the CPI(ML) Dhirendra Kumar said that the state government earlier booked party activists in Jehanabad under Tada and now treason charges were being brought against them in Darbhanga. It reflected the mental bankruptcy of the government.

He said surprisingly the state government, which had arrested Advani in Samastipur for allegedly spreading communalism, was given a red carpet welcome in Darbhanga and those who dared to oppose him were lathicharged and then charged with treason. The ground reality was that the Rabri government was not fighting communalism at any place. The externment of VHP leader Praveen Togadia from the airport was a sham, Kumar added.

7,VHP's N Bihar bandh a flop show,"Patna: The north Bihar bandh, called by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), had little impact on Tuesday. According to information received from Bhagalpur, Saharsa and other places, life was normal with commercial establishments and schools running smoothly.

The bandh was called against the externment of senior VHP leaders Praveen Togadia and Acharya Giriraj Kishore by the state government immediately after their arrival at Patna airport on August 15 and 16 respectively. The only district which witnessed disturbaces during the bandh was Muzaffarpur.

VHP supporters made frantic attempts to disrupt rail traffic in Muzaffarpur but they were chased away by securitymen. The VHP and Bajrang Dal activists stopped Vaishali Express at Siho station for some time. They also blocked Muzaffarpur-Darbhanga road for four hours at Bhabbi.

8,Priests to go by rule book for weddings,"KOLKATA: Priests of Kolkata have put their foot down against performing marriage ceremonies without proper legal and medical documents. The initiative which started as an effort of the Maniktala tol and few other priests have now become the â€˜mantraâ€™ for almost every priest in the city.

From now, a priest can refuse to perform marriage ceremonies, unless legal documents like age and marriage registration certificates are produced.

Netai Chakraborty from the Vaidic Pandit Purohit Mahamilan Kendra said â€œI will keep in mind these formalities when performing the next marriage ceremony. I have asked my jajman to produce blood reports and the registration certificate if he wants me to perform the wedding. He has agreed.â€�

Chakrabortyâ€™s jajman Dilip Das has arranged for his daughterâ€™s wedding in February. He has agreed to provide blood reports and register the marriage before Chakraborty will perform the ceremony according to Hindu rituals.

Chakraborty adds, â€œPeople will understand we are insisting on this for their own good, to save them from future complications whether medical or legal. Even if we manage to convince one family now it will be the start of a healthy trend.â€�

The priests have also decided to organise a refresher camp just before the Durga Puja, where they are expecting to get at least 200 to 300 priests to join the campaign and spread the word.

The fraternity of priests in the city believes that the recent high court order that had made registered marriages mandatory will give the necessary boost for their initiative.

9,Stay on Mulayam's arrest till Oct 15,"LUCKNOW: The high court here on Tuesday, while extending the interim order, stayed the entire proceedings including the arrest of Mulayam Singh Yadav in the misuse of chief ministerâ€™s discretionary fund case and fixed October 15 next for further order. The bench, comprising Justice Vishnu Sahai and Justice Abdul Mateen, passed the above order on a writ petition filed on behalf of Mulayam Singh Yadav by senior advocate Virendra Bhatia, challenging the validity of the FIR lodged against him at Hazratganj police station.

The court, on the request of state counsel Jyotindra Misra and LP Misra, counsel for Mayawati, allowed further one-week time to file counter affidavits on their behalf and, thereafter, four weeksâ€™ time was allowed to Mulayam to file a rejoinder affidavit, if any.

On May 7 last, while posting the petition for August 19, the bench had restrained the respondents from proceeding with further investigation including the arrest in connection with any of the 67 FIRs or 148 cases filed in connection with the exercise of discretion by the petitioner in making grants from the CMDF during his tenure as chief minister of UP from December 5, 1989 to June 24, 1991 and December 4, 1993 to June 3, 1995.

It was stated on behalf of the petitioner that false FIRs had been lodged at the instance of Mayawati, there was a yawning gap of at least eight years between the date of incident and the lodging of FIR and, hence, the move was malafide.

10,Illicit love affair ends in suicide,"HOWRAH: Looking at the smiling photograph of Piyali Banerjee that her mother had placed on her living room shelf, no one would have ever imagined that the 28-year-old could end her life.

Piyali, who attempted suicide on August 12, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Howrah. According to her relatives, Piyali was in a dilemma about her affair with a married man with children, who lived in the neighbourhood.

Of late, he and his friends had been pressuring her to elope, which she refused if he did not divorce his wife. â€œOn August 12, she locked her room on the pretext of taking an afternoon nap.

We became suspicious when she did not respond to the knocks on the door. When the door was broken open we found her hanging from the ceiling fan with her dupatta,â€� said her mother Chhabi Banerjee.

The philosophy honours student from Howrahâ€™s Narasingha Dutta College had a good academic record. She had rejected a number of marriage proposals because of her affair. â€œOf late, she had become depressed. He had also put pressure on her to demand money from us so that they could rent a flat and live together,â€� said her mother.

11,August 25 rally crucial for BSP,"LUCKNOW: On August 25, when the Bahujan Samaj Party holds its national conference in Lucknow, chief minister Mayawati and party national president Kanshi Ram may give fresh guidelines to party workers to deal with the BJP and the Samajwadi Party.

At a meeting held earlier in Lucknow, the chief minister asked the 12 state chiefs of the BSP to send strong contingents of workers from their respective states. In view of the vidhan sabha session beginning three days after the conference, homilies of Kanshi Ram and Mayawati to party workers will be crucial for MLAs and partymen.

By holding this conference, the chief minister will convey the message that the Bahuajan Samaj now has resources enough to take on the mainstream political parties. In Swabhiman, Dhikkar and Pardafaash rallies held on January 14, September 28 and April 14, respectively, the BSP had already demonstrated its mass-mobilising capacity. Party sources told TNN that while contesting vidhan sabha elections in the four states going to polls by the end of the year, the BSP would target the 2004 parliamentary elections. Aware of the fact that the partyâ€™s pact with the BJP might not last long, the leadership was likely to unfold its plan for the coming days, said a party worker.

The UP unit of the BSP, sources said, had told the Rajasthan unit to send impressive contingent from the state. The recent truce struck between Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mayawati had proved to be a boon for the Bihar BSP which was planning to send a big contingent from the state, said sources in the party. A few months ago, relations between Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mayawati had soured when the Bihar strongman gobbled up the entire BSP in his state. Interestingly, the Samajwadi Partyâ€™s youth wing is also holding its protest march the same day the hike in school and college fees and bad law and order in the state. This meeting is to be addressed by Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav. According to reports, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party workers had minor scuffle in the past few days at several places while pasting posters of their leaders. A government official told this correspondent that the administration was keeping a watch on such activities so that the two party workers did not indulge in a clash.

12,Power minister to hold talks with agitating employees,"LUCKNOW: In an attempt to break the ongoing impasse energy minister Ramveer Upadhaya will hold talks with office-bearers of Vidyut Karamchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti on Wednesday.

The talks come after a 6-day work boycott by power employees and a threat of agitation being prolonged if their demands were not met. The employees including engineers have been agitating over the governmentâ€™s one-sided decision to set up four distribution companies and the subsequent enforcement of the new transfer scheme. The handing over of Kesco to NTPC is also another major issue.

The last round of talks between the energy minister and samiti members on these issues had been held on July 21. The talks ended with the assurance that another round would be held to resolve pending issues. However, instead of holding talks, the government chose to implement the new transfer scheme on August 12. The very next day the power employees launched their work boycott agitation.

13,State lawyers gear up for the big fight,"LUCKNOW: It is a case of a strange role reversal for UP judges who find themselves in the dock. Putting a big question mark on the credibility of judicial officers both form the subordinate courts and high court are lawyers who seem to have dug in their heels for a pitched battle.

The state-wide strike on Monday by the clan over ""alleged corruption among judges"" - an unprecedented event in the judicial history of UP- could only be the first salvo.

Even as there is much exultation in the lawyers'' camp for pulling the issue out of the closet at long last, UP Bar Council readies itself to demand constitutional amendments to ""stem the rot plaguing the exalted office"".

Talking to The Times of India on Tuesday, chairman of state Bar Council PK Singh said that the all-India judicial conference convened by the council on October 18 and 19 will have three-point agenda. ""Firstly, instead of two-third majority required, the impeachment of a judge should be allowed by a simple majority of the house. Secondly, the criminal contempt proceedings should be done away with altogether. The third point seeks abolition of special protection for judiciary against raids.

The council, says Singh, is sending out invitation to all MPs along with members of bar councils of different states. ""With corruption in UP judiciary touching 95 per cent mark, it is time to catch the bull by the horn,"" said Singh.

The Council, he said, had already lodged formal complaints with the chief justice of the Allahabad High Court for alleged misconduct of judges in district courts specially in Kanpur, Mainpuri and Saharanpur.

In one of the districts, a lawyer and a victim of a murderous assault by a drug lord, had named the ADJ and the DJ in an FIR under 120 B, he said. The case involved seizure of morphine worth crores.

The CJ, he said, had been supplied with documentary evidence- including copies of doctored judgment sheets by the subordinate judiciary ""where fresh paper was pasted on original order sheet"".

The president of Avadh Bar Council, LP Mishra claimed that"" he has been receiving complaints of nepotism monetary wheeling dealing against judges practically everyday. However, lawyers demure to put it in black and white fearing judicial backlash.""

An advocate questioned the selection procedure of the high court judges. The advocate incidentally had filed a writ before the Lucknow bench claiming that out of the 13 names cleared for the high court collegium for elevation in 2000 eight candidates had sitting judges as relatives.

Though the writ was dismissed the then law minister Ram Jethmalani instituted an inquiry to discover that 90 out of 151 candidates for elevation were kith and kin of high court or supreme court judges.

""We have a woman friend of a sitting judge wrestling with a lawyer in the courtroom,"" said a young woman lawyer. Things are turning out to be too murky and judiciary could do with a bit of image building, she opined.

14,No-trust move failure highlights Cong' strategic incapacity,"NEW DELHI: Two days of debate in the Lok Sabha, featuring over 30 speakers from as many political parties, failed to make any point either for or against the government. Neither did it shift any political goal posts.

The ruling coalition remains where it is, with a reasonably comfortable majority, while the opposition remains where it has been, still not quite united and lacking that killer instinct that makes for a winner.

All that the two-day talkathon achieved is to confirm that the country is up for a general election that promises to set records for plumbing the depths of viciousness and slander. Both sides sought to capture the high ground on ``national security'''', but all they did was to write another chapter in exploiting the memory of the unfortunate jawans who died in the Kargil war.

The ``low ground'''' was easily reached, with one accusing the other of making money on the ``blood of the Kargil martyrs'''' while the other side focused its attack on Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin.

The main actors, Prime Minister Vajpayee, his deputy L K Advani, George Fernandes and Sonia Gandhi, said what they had to along expected lines.

But the tone and tenor of the debate was set by lesser actors. To begin from bottom up: The most soporific speech was delivered by former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda who went on and on about his own role in the security of India, including his role as a tank expert who wanted the Army to buy a tank other than the T-90s that it did. Uma Bharti and Vasundhara Raje were fielded because of the coming elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, but the two putative chief ministers were neither incendiary, nor edifying.

The Congress'' use of the parliamentary brahmastra was to get some electoral wind rather than to effect the collapse of the government.

This is where its basic weakness lay and it failed because it has neither successfully indicted the government''s record, nor shaken the political coalition on which the government has been built. In fact, if anything it may have had the effect of solidifying the ruling coalition.

The Congress'' failure is all the more palpable because Kargil was a result of an intelligence failure for which the government of the day cannot escape responsibility.

Neither could the government have easily walked away from the failure of ``Operation Parakaram'''' last year, when more people died in a misconceived mass mobilisation of the Army, than those killed in Kargil.

The opposition''s inability to capitalise on the government''s many known failures on other fronts, especially Gujarat, speaks more of the Congress'' strategic incapacity which will not be overcome by tactical moves like the no-confidence motions.

15,Baghdad suicide blast rattles UN's resolve,"UNITED NATIONS: Concern was much in evidence among top echelons of world body that the devastating blast at its Baghdad headquarters, which killed at least 17 people including a top envoy, might not be an isolated incident but a deliberate decision by terrorists to target of the international staff.

The mood among the staff at the headquarters was that of mourning as the victims had friends and colleagues here. And now, questions were being raised whether it is worthwhile risking lives in Iraq when adequate security is not available.

The UN flag was lowered to half-mast at its headquarters in New York in memory of top UN envoy to Iraq, Sergio Viera de Mello, who was among those killed in the blast in Baghdad on Tuesday.

Reflecting that mood, the Staff Council''s security committee angrily demanded that Annan suspend all operations in Iraq till the security could be guaranteed and called for ""full inquiry"" as to why the adequate security was not in place.

Diplomats see a change of strategy of whosoever is organising the attacks to hit foreigners and infrastructure to create a sense of insecurity and to send the message that the United States is incapable of guaranteeing either safety or development of the country.

The idea behind targeting international staff could be, they say, to scare them away and disrupt the humanitarian assistance progarmme as also reconstruction process.

That would hurt the Iraqi people and thus increase the already rising anti-American sentiments.

16,SUCI calls for Bangla bandh on Aug 21,"KOLKATA: Left wing Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI) has called for a 24-hour West Bengal bandh on Thursday in protest against recent steps of the state government, like raising tuition fees in colleges, introduction of capitation fee in medical education, a sharp increase in electricity bills and imposition of various kinds of taxes.

SUCI leader Provas Ghosh said in Kolkata on Wednesday that essential services would be left out of the purview of the bandh. The SUCI would make no effort to enforce the bandh forcibly, he promised.

The CPI-ML (Liberation), a Naxalite faction, too, had issued a bandh call on the same day on similar issues, though Ghosh claimed that there was no co-ordination between the two parties.

Trinamul Congress, the main Opposition party in the state, would not oppose the bandh call, though it would not extend active support to it either, Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee said.

Opposing the bandh call, the ruling CPM has requested the people to keep life normal. The state government, too, has promised to make sufficient arrangements for this.

Public transport would ply and security forces would be present in adequate numbers to foil attempts to enforce the bandh.

17,Sahitya Sammelan election plan announced,"PUNE: The process for electing president of the 77th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, the prestigious all India Marathi literary meet, has been set in motion.

The election programme was announced on Wednesday by Raja Phadnis, election officer of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal, the apex Marathi literary body on the backdrop of the recent controversy over validity of author Subhash Bhende''s election as president of the 76th meet held in Karad earlier this year.

The joint charity commissioner in Mumbai recently declared Bhende''s election invalid on ground that a list of voters was not made available. Author Jawahar Mutha, who lost against Bhende, had filed the petition challenging the election process.

The joint charity commissioner also asked Bhende to work as defacto trustee on the Sahitya Mahamandal - a public trust, and not as a defacto chairman as per convention. The Sahitya Mahamandal has already challenged the verdict.

Addressing a news conference here, Phadnis said that the list of 523 voters was published on Wednesday. Interested candidates can send their names through member and affiliated literary institutions of the Sahitya Mahamandal and those co-opted as members till September 4 by 5 pm. Candidatures can be withdrawn till 5 pm on September 11.

Phadnis stated that ballot papers would be sent through post from September 22. Ballot papers duly filled should reach the Sahitya Mahamandal by 5 pm on October 20. Results of the elections will be announced on the same day after 5 pm.

Elaborating on the process, Phadnis said that people who proposed and seconded the name of presidential candidate should have been members of the Maharashtra Sahitya Parishad for at least one year.

The candidate should be member of the member, affiliated or co-opted literary institute and also furnish his consent letter. All these documents should reach the Maharashtra Sahitya Parishad by 5 pm on August 30. The documents would be scrutinised by September 4.

Since the past many years, the Sahitya Sammelans have become centres of controversy on issues ranging from whether politicians should be invited to the literary meets to whether money should be accepted from the government for organising the meet.

The 75th Sammelan at Pune was in the eye of the storm due to the Marathi vs IT battle. It has also been a fashion to hold parallel literary meets by dubbing the conventional Sammelan as pro-Brahmin.

18,2 incomes for EPF subscribers soon,"NEW DELHI: The 3.2 crore Employees Profident Fund (EPF) subscribers will soon be able to earn a substantive pension for life time from two sources -- the existing EPS ''95 as well as from the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojna, recently announced by Prime Minister Vajpayee, Labour ministry source here said.

The Varishtha Pension Bima Yojna (VPBY) is a pension scheme which is meant for citizens who have attained the age of 55 years. The scheme which is operated by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), guarantees a return of 9 per cent. The Labour Minister Sahib Singh Verma will be explaining this scheme at a briefing on Thursday, labour ministry sources said.

Under the scheme, a lump sum deposit of Rs 2.66 lakhs guarantee''s a monthly income of Rs 2,000 per month till the life time of the investor and on his death the principal amount will be refunded to the nominees. But this scheme is applicable to the EPF subscribers only, an insider of the Central Board of Trustees which deals with Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), said.

It was felt that since the final settlement in case of most EPF employees is very low, as members tend to make early withdrawals, there was a need from some more scheme. ""Moreover, the aging population in various countries including India pose policy challenges which hinge on finding ways and means of insulating worker''s from extreme poverty in old age,"" the source said.

Hence, it was felt that it would be appropriate to allow EPF members who had attained the age of 55 years to draw money from their provident fund balances for investment in the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojna. ""This will set up, for such class of workers, a second monthly income stream apart from the pension under the EPS'' 95. The 9 per cent rate of return will guarantee a higher return than the investment made by EPF under the pattern of investment,"" he said.

He further said, ""Tthe advantage will be that lump sum payment taken out of provident fund after retirement and which is often frittered away will be checked.""

20,"India, China unite to counter US-EU farm plan","NEW DELHI: India and China joined 12 other major developing nations in the WTO negotiations on agriculture trade in Geneva on Wednesday and tabled a counter-proposal to the last week''s US-EU farm plan.

The joint proposal of India plus 13 has far-reaching implications, according to trade diplomats here, but its immediate impact would be to halt the powerful US-EU combine from running away with the WTO farm negotiations.

No sooner than Brazil and China had introduced the joint paper in Geneva on Wednesday afternoon, commerce and industry minister Arun Jaitley announced its content in a news conference in New Delhi and explained how the latest move is aimed at protecting the interests of India''s 650 million farm sector population.

""We are seeking to fully sagegard India''s food security and livelihood of our large farm-dependent population. We are also seeking to substantially reduce the subsidies the rich countries give on farm products so that our farmers are able to export their produce,"" he said.

21,"India, China unite to counter US-EU farm plan","NEW DELHI: India and China joined 12 other major developing nations in the WTO negotiations on agriculture trade in Geneva on Wednesday and tabled a counter-proposal to the last week''s US-EU farm plan.

The joint proposal of India plus 13 has far-reaching implications, according to trade diplomats here, but its immediate impact would be to halt the powerful US-EU combine from running away with the WTO farm negotiations.

No sooner than Brazil and China had introduced the joint paper in Geneva on Wednesday afternoon, commerce and industry minister Arun Jaitley announced its content in a news conference in New Delhi and explained how the latest move is aimed at protecting the interests of India''s 650 million farm sector population.

""We are seeking to fully sagegard India''s food security and livelihood of our large farm-dependent population. We are also seeking to substantially reduce the subsidies the rich countries give on farm products so that our farmers are able to export their produce,"" he said.

Before the proposal was moved in Geneva, Jaitley had got the group of ministers (GOM) comprising, among others finance and agriculture ministers, approve the document. He dismissed all talks of differences with agriculture minister Rajnath Singh, saying the government works in complete unison.

22,Criticism of Bengal education system upsets minister,"KOLKATA: West Bengal higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakrabartyâ€™s statement that students from the state to migrate elsewhere to study do so only after having failed to secure admission to the best institutions in the state have raised a few eyebrows.

Speaking at a programme organised by the Bengal Initiative at the state assembly to release its report on â€˜Education in Bengalâ€™, Chakrabarty said, â€œThose who get into universities like the JNU are not our best students. These universities have quotas for every state and students who fail to secure admission to the best universities or institutes here, go to JNU and other placesâ€�.

The statement raised several eyebrows in the audience, which included the likes of scientists Bikash Sinha and Sushanta Dutta Gupta, economist Anup Sinha, linguist Pabitra Sarkar, Bengal Initiative chairman Amiya Gooptu and many others.

The higher education scene in the state came in for criticisms from senior and well known academics at the meet -â€” which did not go down well with the state higher education minister.

Elaborating on the report, â€œFocus on Education in Bengalâ€™ which highlights the drawbacks and strengths of the stateâ€™s system, compares it with the more successful system in Kerala and suggests several ways out, convenor of Bengal Initiativeâ€™s education group and IIMC professor Surendra Munshi said, â€œwe hope that this report will go some way in helping the state regain some of its lost glory in the field of educationâ€�.

West Bengal University of Technology vice chancellor Bikash Sinha expressed surprise that while students from West Bengal were definitely the best in India, the state lacked good faculty. â€œThe acute shortage of faculty here is baffling. Something is going wrong somewhere,â€� he said.

Sarkar spoke on the need to â€œimprove matters and to improve the standard of English language in colleges,â€� while Datta Gupta expressed the need to â€œnetworkâ€� between different institutions of higher education to â€œutilise and exploit the best that Bengal hasâ€�.

The ministerâ€™s reply caught the academics off guard. â€œWhy are you unnecessarily painting a bad picture. Things are much better than you say. We have taken several steps to improve matters. Today when UGC teams come visiting they tell me our system is good. And we still produce the best students. I see no reason for some of the harsh words spoken today. However, the report will definitely be of great help and I will read it,â€� he said.

23,"Talks between govt, transporters fail","KOLKATA: The West Bengal government and transport owners are gearing up for a showdown as Transport Minister Subhas Chakroborty on Wednesday asked bus and mini bus workers ''to defy owners and foil'' the 72-hour transport strike from August 26.

As talks failed between the two sides on the new motor vehicles tax regime, Chakroborty threatened to take over private buses and mini buses in â€˜public interestâ€™ if the transporters remain â€˜stubborn on the unjustified strikeâ€™.

Leaders of 11 transport unions said they would go ahead with the proposed 72-hour strike as they were unhappy and angry with the ministerâ€™s ""lack of honest effort"" to end the deadlock.

The transporters met Chakraborty as well as senior home department and police officials during the day.

""The transporters had complained about police and motor vehicles harassment. The meeting was arranged for mutual understanding. Some of their grievances were not baseless and would be redressed suitably,"" said the minister.

He also announced the formation of a 17-member committee comprising transporters and departmental representatives to review the new vehicle taxes. The committee will submit the report by September and the government would decide its stand by September 10.

Chakroborty also indicated that he would be ready to roll back some of the new tax slabs while justifying the rest of the increase as reasonable. ""Though I have taken such initiatives, the transporters did not bother to think over my appeal to call off the strike. I do not like it and urge the workers involved in passengers transport to defy their stubborn owners and run the vehicles to foil the strike in public interest,"" he said.

A visibly peeved minister declared that government would take all possible legal steps to ensure public conveyance. ""The law empowers the government to acquire or put the private vehicles on requisition,"" he added.

""We placed our accusations about police harassment in the meeting. However, Chakrabarty merely said he would look into matters,"" said Bengal Bus Syndicate representative Swarnakamal Saha.

Leaders of Bengal Minibus Owners Syndicate and Minibus Co-ordination Committee were hardly impressed with the formation a review committee. ""We see no potion but to carry on with or plan or 72-hour strike, if the state government continues to act in such a high-handed manner,"" said Progressive Taximens Union leader Madan Mitra.

25,HC restrains Hrithik Roshan's arrest,"MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court on Wednesday restrained the Khar police from arresting actor Hrithik Roshan, his filmmaker father Rakesh Roshan and his maternal grandfather J Omprakash till September 4 in a criminal case of alleged cheating and criminal breach of trust.

The court adjourned to September 3, a bunch of petitions filed by the Roshans seeking to quash lower court orders directing police to probe the alleged cheating cases.

Six cases of alleged cheating were filed by Jayantilal Gada managing director of Popular Entertainment Network against the Roshans and Mr Omprakash alleging breach of agreements for merchandising of certain films.

Advocates Ashok Mundargi and Dipesh Mehta representing the Roshans and Mr Omprakash told a division bench comprising Justice Ranjana Desai and Justice V M Kanade that neither the complaints against the actor nor the first information report registered by the police disclose any criminal offence.

They said Mr Gada''s complaints against the Roshans was a harassment tactic. They added that a purely civil dispute was being treated as a criminal case.

But senior counsel A Y Sakhare representing Mr Gada said his client had spent Rs 2 crore to promote the actor and that the Roshans had deliberately backed out of the contract. He said the Roshans always intended to renege from the contract and hence a criminal case of cheating was made out.

28,Delhi govt is now keen to trim 'bulges',"NEW DELHI: Winds of change will soon be sweeping the cobwebby corridors of Delhi''s babudom.

The administrative reforms department of the Delhi government has been asked by the Chief Secretary''s office to carry out an employee audit. The order came on August 5.

The move was initiated after the latest statistics on Delhi government employees were collated. The numbers and the ''bulges'' in certain departments were enough to set off alarm bells within the government.

""It is the effort of the government as a whole and of all departments to trim the bulge in various departments,"" said Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra. According to sources, the move was prompted by a seminar earlier this year on trimmer governments. IT secretary Prakash Kumar had presented a paper at the seminar from where the idea germinated. The statistics made it imperative.

Departments have been issued forms with three basic questions. To identify posts which have become redundant, which have lain vacant for over a year, and pin point areas where outsourcing can be possible.

According to officials, the departments under special scrutiny would be that of labour, employment, rehabilitation and various government hospitals.

""Take the example of the department of labour, and the Delhi Shops and Establishment Act that they have to enforce. The job can be done by a market association more efficiently than an inspector from the department,"" said an official involved in the project.

Also on the axing list will be hospitals, especially the security and cleaning staff. While the government has been cautious not to mention the danger word ""retrenchment"", the obvious fear is that the move may lead to it. Even Class I officers have been sent detailed forms asking them to detail their work, how much time they spend on each task and their accomplishments in a given financial year.

""It is like an assessment form, I''ve received one for the first time,"" said an official, busy filling the form.
