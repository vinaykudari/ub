0,SC notice to UP govt on Ansari gun deal,"NEW DELHI: Taking note of a petition seeking CBI probe into the alleged attempt by an army deserter to sell a light machine gun (LMG) to UP legislator Mukhtar Ansari for Rs 1 crore, the Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to the Central and UP governments and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

In a public interest petition, Rohit Pandey alleged that the officers of the Special Task Force (STF), who arrested the army deserter, were being victimised by the state government to protect Ansari.

A Bench of Justices S N Variava and H K Sema issued the notices after hearing Pandeyâ€™s counsel D K Garg. He said that the STF had arrested the army deserter at Varanasi on January 24, 2004. The STF had learnt that the LMG and its cartridges he was carrying were meant to be sold to Ansari for Rs 1 crore.

The STF detained the deserter and his relatives under Pota and recommended invocation of the stringent anti-terrorist law against Ansari, but the state government rejected its suggestion.

The UP government even put pressure on STF members to withdraw the recommendation, Garg argued. Thereafter, almost all members of the STF were transferred and one deputy superintendent of police Shailendra Singh submitted his resignation refusing to buckle under the pressure.

The petitioner sought a thorough CBI inquiry as the chief minister had categorically stated that Pota would not be invoked against Ansari.

2,A desert nibbles away at Anantapur farmlands,"ANANTAPUR: Good news for film producers and location hunters. You need not go to another state in search of a desert.

The desert has come closer to you. Take a bus to Anantapur, which is 400 km away from Hyderabad, and you will see thousands of acres filled with fine sand dotted with desert plants.

The desert in Anantapur, popularly called â€˜Isuka Dibbaluâ€™ are located at Kannekal mandal and is about 100 km from Anantapur town and spreads over thousands of acres. According to the residents of the locality, the desert is fast spreading to adjoining villages. The sand has already crossed beyond few villages like Darga Hannur, Meedla Palli among others. In fact, movie directors have already found these sand dunes perfect for desert scenes. Recently a Telugu film Jayam Manadera, had its desert scenes shot from the sand dunes spread along Darga Hannur village.

â€œThe sand is slowly spreading all over the place. This has particularly become very active in the recent years,â€� B Govinda of Darga Hannur village said.

â€œOur fields are buried under these sand dunes. I remember some four decades ago there used to be a thin layer of sand along a small stream about two kilometres away from the village but now it has spread everywhere,â€� he added.

â€œI own 15 acres of land and nearly five acres have already gone under the sand,â€� he said. There are nearly 100 houses at this village. About a decade ago 1000 people used to live here but now half of them have migrated to cities like Mumbai, Bangalore leaving old people to fend for themselves, he said.

â€œIt does not make any difference to which party we vote since no one is going to help us out of this situation. The politicians only make promises but they never keep them,â€� Govinda said.

It is high time that everyone left the village otherwise it is difficult to survive in these sands and government has not even taken note of the dangerous situation that the district is falling in, B Gopal, another villager said.

Even the road which was laid connecting the villages in the area is getting covered under the sand and regularly it need to be removed, he said. â€œWe have been facing sever drought for the past seven years. This year too there are no crops. We donâ€™t know what is in store for us,â€� he said. Fortunately there is one hand pump for drinking water purposes Even the road which was laid connecting the villages in the area is getting covered under the sand and regularly it need to be removed, he said. â€œWe have been facing sever drought for the past seven years. This year too there are no crops. We donâ€™t know what is in store for us,â€� he said.

Fortunately there is one hand pump for drinking water purposes in the village, he added. It is impossible to stay in the village from June to August because of heavy sand storms, he said. There are so many schemes but nothing reaches us, another villager said. â€œWe have not benefited from any of the schemes government has announced so far,â€� he added. The district collector has visited the village once and asked the villagers to start planting trees to stop the desert from spreading all over the place. Ironically, there is no water for planting trees and the government has done nothing to develop greenery.

3,Senate okays landmark US unborn victims law,"WASHINGTON: The US Senate on Thursday approved legislation that would recognise a foetus as a victim separate from its mother during a violent crime.

Lawmakers voted 61-38 to approve a measure called the ""Unborn Victims of Violence Act,"" which was passed in the House of Representatives last month. The two chambers now must iron out their differences and then send the measure to president George W Bush.

Under current US law, an individual who commits a crime of violence against a pregnant woman receives no additional punishment for killing or injuring the woman''s unborn child.

Twenty-nine states already have laws to that effect on the books, but no such federal statute exists.

Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist lauded the vote.

""This bill recognises that when a criminal attacks a pregnant woman and kills her unborn child, he has claimed not just one, but two precious human lives. It ensures that those who prey upon a pregnant woman and her child will pay a heavy price,"" he said.

Opponents have criticised the bill as a backdoor effort by conservatives to confer greater rights on the unborn child, thereby opening the door to an eventual ban on abortion.

""This is a concerted strategy that is aimed at weakening Roe v. Wade,"" said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, referring to the landmark 1973 SC decision giving US women a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy if they wish.

""If you can establish a beachhead right in federal criminal law here ... you give the Supreme Court the ability to say, ''it is in law that embryos have certain rights'',"" Feinstein said on the Senate floor.

""It''s got nothing to do with abortion,"" Pennsylvania Republican Rick Santorum countered. ""The issue is ... do we recognise the humanity of the child,"" he said.

The Republican-led house last month passed its version of the bill by a vote of 254 to 163.

The House also passed similar legislation in 1999 and 2001, but Thursday''s debate marks the first time that the Senate has taken up the bill.

The legislation defines an ""unborn child"" as a child in utero, which it says ""means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.""

""This bill recognises that there are two victims,"" said Senator Mike DeWine, a chief sponsor. Americans, he said, ""intuitively know that there is a victim besides the mother.""

4,Security increased on airport stretch,"MUMBAI: Following a series of articles in this newspaper about the waylaying of tourists on the highway between the airport and Mahim, police commissioner A N Roy has stepped up patrolling on this stretch, police sources said.

All the six police stations between Sahar airport and Mahim causeway have been directed to ensure that the stretch on the Western Express Highway in their jurisdictions is patrolled at night.

Each police station has two jeeps and two motorcycles which will now be deployed on the Sahar-Mahim stretch. The two flyovers on this stretch are a favourite haunt of highway robbers. Tourists are often waylaid on the flyover,where no one can witness the robbery.

Over the last two decades, several gangs have been operating on the airport stretch. Their nexus with the local police allowed them to flourish till it became a big menace.

In the 1990s, the police eliminated the ring leaders in encounters but fresh gangs cropped up. Of late, even out-of-work gangsters have taken to highway robbery.

Police pickets were kept at strategic points on the highway till 2002, after which the practice was discontinued for lack of staff.

This time the stress is on patrolling by motorcycle-borne marshalls.

5,Family of 4 in suicide pact,"MUMBAI: Four members of an iron traderâ€™s family were found dead in their Kandivli apartment on Friday.

Police believe Ketan Anuwadia and his family may have committed suicide by consuming potassium cynaide, since he was unable to pay back huge loans.

Covered in spotless white bedsheets from head to toe, the bodies of Ketan (40), his wife Keena (33) and sons Rishi (10) and Devansh (5) were found by a family friend at about 2.30 pm.

The friend had rushed to the flat after the Anuwadiasâ€™ maid informed him about a note pasted on the door of her employersâ€™ first-floor flat in Nikunj Chhaya building on Mathuradas Road. The note said, â€œPlease do not touch with naked hand. It might be poison (potassiumcyanide).â€™â€™

Deputy commissioner of police R D Shinde said that the friend also heard the Gayatrimantra being played in the background when he entered the bedroom where the bodies lay. Police have also found a three-page note in Gujarati, the contents of which are not yet known.

In a similar incident at Thane in December last year, Santosh Surve of the chit fund company, Kalpavruksha Finance, shot dead his wife and two daughters aged five and seven. Surve took the extreme step as he was unable to repay the investors.

Again,onJanuary 26,afamily of four was found hanged to death near the Wadala railway station after they were unable to repay a loan.

7,Four suspects arrested in Dake murder case,"PUNE: The Sahakarnagar police, in a pre-dawn raid on Friday on a Dhaba on Saswad road, arrested four suspects in the Dake murder case.

The four accused, allegedly involved in the sensational murders of Shiv Sena activists Tushar and Atul Dake at Bibvewadi on Thursday, have been sentenced to police custody till April 1 by judicial magistrate first class A.A.A. Sheikh.

The four, Vishal Vinay Kadam (21) of Sukhsagarnagar, Bibvewadi, Yogesh Dhore (25) of Shewalewadi in Phursungi, Rahul Sonawane (24) and Bhiku Valmiki (30) of Talegaon, were arrested from Sahyadri Dhaba near Vadki Naka.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone II) Vijaysinha Jadhav, while speaking to reporters, said the accused had confessed to the crime and that the two motorcycles used in the attack had been seized.

According to the police, the fatherson duo of Vinay and Nilesh Kadam was still at large. Vinay is a relative of Congress corporator Suresh Kadam. The murder is suspected to be a fallout of political rivalry as Tushar (25), a former Congress worker, had established a Shiv Sena unit on February 22, enraging the Kadams, who viewed it as a challenge to their dominance. While Tushar was killed in a hotel near his residence, his brother Atul was hacked to death in his house.

In the court, the prosecution said the accused had allegedly murdered the two out of political rivalry and asked for police custody to be granted for further investigation. The prosecution said the police were still to seize, among other things, the clothes worn by the accused during the attack and the revolver used by them to threaten the deceased. Prosecution lawyer D.T. Sonar said the police were also looking into the possibility of a larger conspiracy behind the killings.

Defence lawyer N.D. Pawar said Sonawane, one of the accused, had his hand in a bandage and that there was a â€œpossibilityâ€� that he was â€œassaultedâ€� while in police custody. Asking for the hospitalisation of the injured, he pleaded for minimum police custody to all the accused. However, Jadhav, while speaking to reporters, said that two of the accused were injured during the attack itself.

Stating that Kadam and Dhore had no known criminal records, Jadhav said they were probing the same about Sonawane and Valmiki. He added that there was no apparent role of the Congress corporator, Suresh Kadam, in the attack.

8,Ananth faces wrath of irate party workers,"BANGALORE: Dissidence has raised its head in the Karnataka BJP unit with supporters of those being denied tickets nearly manhandling state chief Ananth Kumar here on Friday.

The drama started on Thursday evening, when a group of workers from Shiggaon, in Haveri district, descended on the campaign office Panchavati, demanding a ticket be given to their leader Rajashekar Sindoor, who recently left the Congress to join BJP. The state election committee, however, has already announced the name of BJP man Somanna Bevinamarad for the constituency.

Sindoorâ€™s supporters staged a dharna, shouted slogans and refused to leave the premises unless a state leader heard them. Although, MLC Mukhyamantri Chandru met them on Thursday, the supporters were not convinced.

All activity at Panchavati was disrupted on Friday, till Kumar arrived around 5 pm. Sources said they grouped around him, shouted slogans and nearly manhandled him.

Kumar is said to have told them: â€œWe have 224 constituencies to consider, we cannot keep making changes in everything. You have to accept our decision and continue as loyal workers of the party.â€™â€™

The agitating party workers dispersed after this, but are still said to be unhappy. Sources said Sindoor might contest as an independent or join the JD(S).

Meanwhile, there is widespread dissatisfaction in the party over tickets distribution, while the alliance with JD(U) has caused a lot of heartburn.

In Mangalore, workers are unhappy that the Baindur seat has been given to the JD(U), while supporters of former Union minister V. Dhananjay Kumar are angry of his being denied the MP ticket.

Similar dissatisfaction is there in Shimoga, Hassan, Chikmagalur, Dharwad, Kolar and Mandya, where seats have been given to the JD(U). Seats given to entrants from other parties has also caused dissent among party workers, even in places like Chitradurga and Udupi, sources added.

The only solace for the party is that it is â€œexpectingâ€™â€™ similar dissidence in the Congress when it announces its list. Kumar left for New Delhi on Friday and the next list of candidates is expected to be announced on Saturday.

9,Lecture on honour killings takes political hue,"CHANDIGARH: The message that a seminar on honour killings and inter-caste marriages wanted to convey was diluted due to lack of facts and too much of rhetoric.

Organised at Panjab University on Friday, the discussion, in later course, took political hue and overtones, much to the dismay of the audience.

The speech that was far away from reality could not drive home the point for which the seminar was organised, disappointing the students'' forum, Critique, the organiser.

Jagmati Sangwan, who is president of the All-India Democratic Women''s Association (AIDWA), Haryana, made some pointed references to the ruling BJP government and its allies for not doing enough to eradicate the social evils.

This ensued heated discussions after the lecture, and the embarrassed organisers had to remind the audience that ""discussions are not aimed to target political parties, but to remove the social stigma associated with inter-caste marriages.""

""Be it the government machinery, administrators or women''s organisations, all are equally to blame. No one is helping the cause,"" said Sangwan, who is also a lecturer at Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak. She, however, added that it was only the communist parties, which were playing their role well.

In fact, her direct references to the BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal for not doing much had a section of audience fuming.

""It is sad that the killing of young persons is not even considered a crime,"" she said, adding that generally it was the marriage of an upper-caste girl and a lower-caste boy which irks the society leaders more.

""This leads to killings, as elders fear that girls would ask for their right in property and the status of lower caste boys would get elevated in the process,"" said Sangwan. ""Killing one''s children is painful for parents, but pressure from feudal leaders forces them to do it,"" she added.
