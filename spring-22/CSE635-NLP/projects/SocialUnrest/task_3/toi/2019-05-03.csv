0,No rules violated: Hoarding owners,"MUMBAI: The hoarding war picked up momentum on Thursday, with the hoarding owners' association counsel Rafiq Dada urging the division bench of Chief Justice C.K. Thakker and Justice S. Radhakrishnan not to punish the hoarding owners as they had not violated any guideline.The association has been opposing the sweeping interim order passed by the high court stopping all hoarding activity.Agreeing that hoarding contractors ought to be punished for violating guidelines, Mr Dada maintained that the interim blanket ban would affect those who were innocent.Countering him, senior counsel Iqbal Chagla, representing city gynaecologist Anahita Pandol who had filed a public interest litigation against the hoarding menace, remarked that heavens would not fall if the interim order was to continue for a month, through the court's summer vacation. He said lifting of the order would definitely result in trees being felled. The matter was adjourned to Friday, the last working day before the court breaks for a month-long summer vacation.Earlier, Mr Chagla systematically demolished BEST's claim that it had not flouted the hoarding guidelines. In fact, he had pictures to prove his claim that the undertaking had not respected the policies.Mr Chagla also pointed out that prohibited colours like red, green and amber had been used in the advertisements.BEST, which had signed a Rs 59-crore hoarding contract on April 24 after the court restrained any new permission, sought an exception pleading that it was not aware of the order passed on April 17.Appearing for BEST, advocate Venkatesh Dhond said in the new contract, BEST would scrupulously follow all the conditions.Arguing that an across the board order restraining permission to all hoarding was incorrect, senior counsel K K Singhvi, appearing for the BMC, sought time to file reply to the PIL. However, when asked by the judges to show the notice issued to defaulters, he could produce only one dated April 22, 2002. Advocate Joaquim Reis, appearing for hoarding firm Jyoti Publicity, said M P Publicity, its sister concern, was in no way connected to the hoardings in FPH compound which were alleged to have violated HC guidelines.Mercury soars in state NAGPUR: Pusad was the hottest town in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra on Thursday recording 46.6 degree Celsius as heatwave conditions continued unabated in the state. Mercury rose to 44.8 degree Celsius in the city.According to the regional meteorological centre, temperatures recorded at other places in Vidarbha included Amravati 42 degrees C, Akola 45.5, Chandrapur-44, Gondia-44.1 and Yavatmal-42.4.

1,BMC hoardings disregard for rules,"MUMBAI: Throwing the rule books into the sea, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporationâ€™s licence department has not only violated the BMC Act of 1888 and the policy guidelines on granting permission for hoardings but also shown disregard for the Coastal Regulation Zone rules that forbid construction within 500 metres of the high tide line.

A hoarding on the northern-end of the Haji Ali waterfront provides a glaring example of how the CRZ regulation has been violated.

Concrete plinths have been sunk into the sand and huge iron pillars have been erected to support the billboard, which blocks the view of the sea and the Haji Ali dargah, a heritage structure.

Clause 16 of the policy guidelines for granting permission for hoardings clearly says that ""no new hoarding framework should be permitted inside mangroves, creek or sea or within 500 metres of the high tide line"".

Rule no 59 of the development control (DC) rules also prohibits hoardings to be erected in the sea.

This hoarding has stood here for several years and the BMC continues to renew its licence.

In another related incident a year ago, former additional municipal commissioner, Vijaysingh Mathankarâ€”who was in-charge of the licence departmentâ€” approved a proposal forwarded by his son to erect a hoarding in the premises of a fire station near the new Bandra flyover.

Ajay Mathankar, the proprietor of Star advertising agency, obtained permission even though fire brigade officials had opposed the plan.

Ajay Mathankar confirmed that his father was in office when his proposal was approved, but added, ""My father was abroad when I got the contract.""

Rule no 33 of the code of discipline and conduct for government employees says that they should not give contracts to their relatives.

Mr Mathankar claimed that he had followed the necessary procedures before getting permission. ""The contract was not given arbitrarily to me and tenders were called for,"" he said.

Mr Vijaysinh Mathankar currently the divisional commissioner of Nashik. In another violation of the rules, a huge hoarding has been erected the Lala Lajpatrai garden in Worli.

Civic officials said the permission for the hoarding was granted to Mittal advertisement agency exchange for maintaining the garden.

However, the rules do not permit the erection of scaffoldings in gardens and the BMC had even issued a circular to this effect some time ago.

Sources point out that hoarding contractors rake in lakhs of rupees and for this they have to spend very small amount to maintain the gardens.

Superintendent of licences B S Gholap declined to comment on the issue.

2,Charity show for riot-hit: Udhas,"GORAKHPUR: Renowned ghazal singer Pankaj Udhas, expressing concern at Gujarat riots, said that musicians of the country would organise a charity show in Mumbai in the last week of May for the riot-hit.

Talking to mediapersons here on Thursday, he regretted the rising tendency among Indian composers for aping the west. â€œPop songs cannot replace classical music,â€� he added. The ghazal singer also criticised the younger generation for not doing riyaz properly.

3,Gays seek repeal of harsh law,"KOLHAPUR: When gay couple Rakesh Bora and Ismail Ansari expressed their love for each other in a public garden, they were beaten black and blue by local goons.

In the case of 21-year-old Noel Paul (name changed), it was the local policemen who blackmailed him, forced him to perform anal sex and later threatened time and again to book him under section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.

â€œWe have regularly been victims of sexual discrimination,â€� rued Paul as tears trickled down his cheeks.

Being gay is like being an â€œoutcastâ€�, particularly in a country where homosexuality is outlawed.

However, of late, several nongovernmental organisations and men-seeking-men groups have cropped up to let sexually-marginalised people express their thoughts, feelings and ideas freely, without any inhibition.

In fact, the Aids Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan, which organised the first public demonstration in defence of gay rights in India in 1992, could be considered a â€œmilestone of visibilityâ€�.

Through the ages, homosexuality has been essayed in several optimistic forms in India.

The best examples could be the frescoes adorning ancient temples depicting love between the same sex and a few chapters in Kamasutra, which are perhaps the earliest documentation of â€œsame-sexâ€� love in Indian culture.

Nonetheless, section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (1860) criminalises homosexual acts.

The law states: â€œUnnatural offences - whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.â€�

The law continues to be loosely interpreted and misused by families, police and ruffians for intimidation and harassment of lesbians, gays, bisexual and transvestites.

Attempts to repeal section 377 have been made by the Indian law commission.

â€œSection 377 has been challenged by ABVA in the Delhi high court in 1994 and also by Naz Foundation India in 2001. Both matters came up for hearing on April 23, 2002,â€� said lawyer Anand Grover, while speaking to the Times News Network.

â€œHowever, conversations with members of the present government make it clear that they will not repeal it,â€� he added.

The total number of cases registered under section 377 from 1860 to 2002 would be impossible to tell as many go unreported, since there is no consolidated database in India.

â€œNevertheless, approximately 65 cases under section 377 have reached appeal from lower courts to high courts/supreme court and been reported in law journals since 1860,â€� said Grover.

4,Surat a jackpot for political fund seekers,"SURAT: Strange but certainly not unbelievable that the city of silks and diamonds has been a jackpot for many a national-level politician for the past several years, not for any political reasons but for collecting funds in the name of party.

No wonder, visit by any national-level leader to this city generates enough dust among the commoners that the purpose could be solely monetary gains, in the garb of some social or political functions.

Hence, it would not be surprising at all as the national-level leaders often oblige someone by being celebrity guest in his house and letting the impression of the politician''s closeness to the guest, for mutual benefits.

Interestingly, the Union minister for human resource development Dr Murli Manohar Joshi held a ''press meet'' (read get-together not conference) at the residence of someone, projected to be close him. Much to the irritation of the media persons present there, the drawing hall of the bungalow was packed with others than reporters.

Moreover, the press meet, which also had a question answer session over the sensitive issue of communal violence in Gujarat and the previous day''s high pitched debate in the Lok Sabha, did not stretch beyond eight minutes. Joshi left the press meet in hurried manner, to join a closed-door gathering over lunch.

The visit by the union defence minister George Fernandes to Surat on April 28, as part of his four-day fact-finding mission, raised doubts among all, including the top police and district administration officials, as Surat was not affected by the communal fury, except for some isolated cases in the beginning.

Visits by politicians from as far as Bihar and Orissa are also common here and often they come to take part in some social functions. Social analysts say the city has migrant population in majority and often they are connected with their state of origins and even for political favours, they are often dependent on the politicians of their states.

On condition of anonymity, one banker with connections in Delhi admitted that he often doles out money to political big-wigs and gets assurance in back for getting works done.

A senior-level IPS official earlier posted in Surat said TNN that sometimes they too get requests through friendly contacts for fund raising purposes, particularly at times of elections.

Nearer the power corridor, easier to get the work done, courtesy ''connections'' and for this even if one has to pay in the name of party fund, one is ever eager to oblige and get obliged in turn, agrees one middleman, on condition of anonymity, who has laboured enough through the years to win enough confidence to maintain Surat-Delhi contacts.

Sources in bureaucracy informed that even sometimes these contacts are used through the ''brokers'' for favourite postings in the state. In one case one senior police official transferred on a shunting post was asked to dole out Rs 5 lakh for sympathetic consideration of his case, through influences in Delhi.

Even during crisis, it is Delhi than Gandhinagar, that plays a significant role, as it happened in the recent communal turbulence in the city. Sources in district administration revealed that more calls were received from Delhi than Gandhinagar for appropriate measures for safety to life and property.

Even ''contacts'' in the Prime Minister''s Office (PMO) became handy for many here to impress upon the local heavyweights in the political circles and public offices to ''rush'' immediate assistance to the callers from Surat.

For example, when miscreants put the Udhana-based dying and printing mill on fire around midnight of February 2, the owner lost no time to get in ''touch'' with the PMO, initially bypassing the local channels of authorities for adequate safety measures.

Interestingly, a secretary of former Lok Sabha speaker G M C Balayogi kept himself posted with the developments in some particular cases even on the day his boss died in a chopper crash, sources in industries informed.

When asked, higher police and district administration officials admitted of ''influences'' from Delhi. But then, in the hours of crisis, right information from any corner were more than welcome for rushing assistance to quell the fury, a senior official said.

Many among the business community here are having their regular contacts in Delhi for business purposes and it is quite natural that those ''contacts'' are used during crisis as well, according to Kadir Pirzada, vice-president of Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee.

When asked about not Gandhinagar but Delhi being closer to Surat, many of the local politicians admitted, among other things, that pulling strings in Delhi for resultant impact has always been an easier option compared to Gandhinagar, as the city of silks and diamonds ranks high in matters of political funding and refusals are hard to come by.

6,Traders plan demonstration,"LUCKNOW: The traders are in combative mood against the trade tax department. On Thursday, UP Yuva Udhyog Vyapar Mandal (UPYUVM) announced to hold massive demonstrations all over the state on May 13 to protest alleged victimisation of traders by the power officials and trade tax department and form â€˜trader flying squadsâ€™ to catch corrupt officials.

UPYUVM president Sandeep Bansal told newspersons that power officials were illegally taking money from the traders and industrialists in the name of power revenue realisation drive. Similarly, he said that the state government decision to lodge FIRs in the case of unauthorised transportation of goods has been misused by the officers of the trade tax department. Bansal said that demonstrations will be held in front of all the district headquarters on May 13 to protest the victimisation.

He said that flying squads will be formed by the end of this month to catch corrupt officials and expose their misdeeds.

7,Packaging rehab with development,"AHMEDABAD: Kutch needs a long-term disaster-mitigation and drought-proofing programme and not mere relief and rehabilitation.

The British agencies that came to the region after last year''s earthquake have discovered dovetailing relief and rehabilitation with development as the best practice.

As many as 12 of the 14 organisations under the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) have not stopped the relief and rehabilitation exercise after the initial phases. They prolonged their stay to help reduce vulnerability of the region and are planning to continue their work for at least another couple of years.

The umbrella organisation, which collected funds worth 24-million pounds from the Brits for Kutch, has recently come up with a report on ''Best Practices in Gujarat Earthquake Response Programme''. It points out the experience and evolution of the practices the agencies have identified and sets out the standards for humanitarian aids.

""This is indeed a best practice aimed at dovetailing relief with development, a recommendation oft made by the development practitioners. Another hallmark of the approach was the ambition of the agencies to improve,"" the report says.

These agencies, in the earlier phase itself, have realised that the rehabilitation and reconstruction must be seized as an opportunity to transform the underdeveloped region.

""We considered this as an opportunity for long-term disaster mitigation and drought proofing. We are into roof-top water harvesting and training village artisans for its installation, we constructed sub-surface dams, installed ground-water recharge structures and helped setting-up village development committees and village modernisation committees,"" says Usha Mishra-Joshi of Oxfam.

The agencies also learnt that besides being prone to several types of natural disasters - like drought, cyclone, flood and earthquake - the social structure of Kutch was complex with influence of caste system and communal dynamism. The agencies claim that they also focused on addressing issues related to reducing both geographical and socio-economic vulnerabilities.

The response to the earthquake was unique and cannot be compartmentalised as relief and rescue in strict sense, the agencies believed. Installation of water distribution systems and water harvesting structures and supply of fodder to cattle, which happened at the later part of the relief phase, cannot be categorised as activities of relief alone, they say.

The new areas which the agencies are focusing now include institutionalisation of health, water distribution systems and water harvesting structures.

The agencies also exercised caution in imposing alien and inappropriate practices. For disaster preparedness, a Community Disaster Mitigation Fund was set-up and seismic safety features were built in the shelters.

""Initially we did not have primary details and data of the region. It would have been better if we had gathered data... Besides, it would have been good had the donors been told as to what was really needed,"" says Donald Manish Burges of the Worldvision.

Some of the organisations have come up with three-to-four years of strategic development programmes as they want their efforts not to discontinue immediately after they leave. ""Our relations have improved with the government and we have learnt how to work together. After the initial effort, we are now focusing on sustainable development,"" says Randel Leek of Save the Children.

Concerted attempts at mitigating the chronic drought conditions and vulnerability to other natural disasters in this semi-arid region seem to continue for sometime.

8,Land sharks inciting riots,"VADODARA: Most believe cosmopolitanism breeds in localities where standard of living is good and literacy is high. But a small pocket in city where residents are illiterate, live in shanties and struggle for two square meals has proved to be more broad-minded.

Sulemani Chawl, a locality of 430 shanties on the Ajwa and Waghodia road junction, is in stark contrast to its communally sensitive surroundings. Hindus and Muslims in the chawl live in harmony. Very few here are literate, most work as daily wage labourers, push carts and rickshaws to survive.

Last night when police cracked its whip here, beating up poor residents including women, smashed a couple of rickshaws, residents living in peace here for over 25 years were taken aback.

""Somebody hurled a crude bomb. A 17-year-old boy got injured in the explosion. We heard the noise and came out to see what had happened but police thought we created trouble and picked up boys from our locality,"" said Ram Kanojia, a peanut vendor.

He said Hindus and Muslims in the chawl have been living in peace for decades and even in the current spate of communal violence did not break the bond of love between two communities. ""We eat and live together. It is the outsiders who hurl petrol bombs on us and create problems. They can''t digest the fact that Hindus and Muslims in the chawl are united,"" Kanojia said.

A common contention among residents is that land sharks are eyeing the plot on which the chawl stands. ""Builders in the area want us to vacate this plot. There is a building complex nearby but it is vacant. Builders feel that the chawl is a black spot on the landscape. Moreover, the chawl is on a prime location and if it is wiped off, the builders who can lay their hands on this land can make a good fortune,"" said Iqbal Mirza, another resident.

He said on March 16, the then deputy commissioner of police Piyush Patel had visited the chawl. Patel shared tea with residents there and appreciated their unity.

""But on Tuesday night we became the victims of police. They did not bother to confirm whether we were the ones who were involved in the riots or we were the victims of riots. They beat us up, smashed our doors and did not even spare the women,"" said SSC student of Nalanda Vidyalaya staying in the chawl Poonam Thakor.

""We are poor people. We don''t have any clout. They overlooked the fact that in this chawl the Hindus and Muslims live in peace and it is the outside elements that want to disturb this unity. Even now our pleas are ignored,"" said Ashok Chauhan, a rickshaw driver.

Mahesh Patel, a factory worker said since curfew has been clamped in the area, the residents are finding it difficult to survive. ""We don''t have anything to eat. The biggest question is how to survive,"" Patel said. ""We urge the police to consider our unity. Instead of targeting us the police should book those who are guilty of fomenting trouble,"" said Premnath Mane, a migrant from Maharashtra.

Residents living in the chawl suspect that a noted builder in Waghodia road is playing mischief. But the residents say that they neither have the resources nor the influence to make a legal case.

Meanwhile, the fabric of unity remains intact in the chawl with Hindu and Muslim residents coming to each other''s aid and nursing wounds.

9,New ponds for prawn farming,"PATNA: Farming of prawns in fresh water is gaining momentum in Bihar. Bihar Scampi Farmersâ€™ Association (BSFA) under the guidelines of Marine Product Export Development Authority (MPEDA), ministry of commerce of the Union government, has initiated prawn farming in fresh water in several north Bihar districts.

Apart from the ongoing development of big ponds for such farming in Barkagaon under Kanti block of Muzaffarpur, Simri under Keoti block of Darbhanga district and Runnisaidpur in Sitamarhi district, the BSFA has started fresh water farming in Bikhari-Chapra under Pakari-Dayal block near Motihari in East Champaran district. The average production is one tonne per hectare in Bikhari-Chapra village. In Motihari alone, the BSFA has exported 3.25 tonnes of fresh water prawns, the weight of each ranging between 100 grams to 175 grams, to Calcutta in the last three months at the rate of Rs 300 to Rs 450 per kg.

BSFA secretary Dilip Kumar Singh, who is leading the prawn revolution in north Bihar, claimed that the districts in north Bihar â€” Darbhanga, Saharsa, Madhubani, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Seohar, Samastipur, Purnia, Supaul and East and West Champaran â€” have perennial sources of water and thus are ideal for fresh water prawn aqua-culture. Farming of fresh water prawns have been successfully carried out in Motihari in ponds developed for this purpose. Now ponds are being developed in Darbhanga in 12. 50 acres of land, in Runnisaidpur in 3.25 acres and Barkagaon in Kanti in Muzaffarpur in six acres. The association has also selected 25 other sites to develop ponds in many places in north Bihar districts.

MPEDA deputy director A K Upadhaya said the MPEDA has carried out a survey of fresh water prawn farming in Bihar and has found that the state has vast potential for such farming. â€œDevelopment of even a portion of available resources in Bihar for fresh water prawn farming can fetch million dollars besides providing employment opportunities to lakhs of people,â€� he added.

Agriculture scientist M P Srivastava, who is associated with the association, said, â€œWe are producing one tonne of prawn in one acre of pond and the harvesting time is only six months, he said.

â€œIf these ponds are properly developed, prawn farming may bring revenue up to Rs 1,000 crore every year,â€� he added.

10,Concern over violence in Gujarat,"PATNA: The Human Rights Association of Bihar has expressed anguish over the continuing communal violence and circulation of pamphlets asking the Hindus not to have any dealing with the Muslims and to crush them economically. The association while appealing to the conscience of the nation to save the country from disintegrating, has demanded an immediate ban on printing and possession of such pamphlets.

The governing body of the association consists of eminent citizens like former chief secretary L Dayal. The association has also said a sitting judge of the Supreme Court should probe all the incidents of violence under the Commission of Inquiries Act. It further stated that the one-judge commission must submit its report in six months and that the report should be made public. The commission should look into the genesis of events, their ratifications, the role played by different individuals, groups, their leaders and state authorities against whom there are serious charges of partisanship.

The association also demanded adequate relief and rehabilitation measures and compensation to the victims.

11,"Rigging, clashes mar council poll","PATNA: Booth capturing, rigging and clashes marked the polling in the eight graduate and teachersâ€™ constituencies of the legislative council on Thursday.

Samata Party MLA Sunil Pandey, along with his 22 supporters, was arrested here at the B N College centre under the Pirbahore police station.

According to official sources, the election to eight council seats from teachers and graduates constituencies passed off peacefully with 60 to 65 per cent voter turnout.

Inspector general of police (operation) Neelmani said the supporters of two rival candidates clashed at the B N College polling booth here and exchanged fire and lobbed bombs. However, no one was injured in the clash. Pandey was released after the completion of the poll, he said.

Over 130 people were taken into custody for disturbing the poll process in four divisionsâ€” Patna, Tirhut, Darbhanga and Saran, he said. As many as 114 contestants were in the fray for the eight council seats.

The polling was held in 112 polling centres of the eight graduates and teachersâ€™ constituencies in Patna. According to assistant returning officer (ARO), Deepak Prasad, who is also the Patna DM, 36 persons, including an MLA, were arrested for disturbing the poll.He said 50 to 60 per cent of polling was registered in Patna district. The counting will be held on May 5 at the B N College centre, he added. The counting of the votes of both Nalanda and Nawada centres (total 74) will also be held at the same centre.

Booth-capturing was reported from several polling centres, including DAV School, Rajbanshi Nagar; Rajkiya Balika High School, Gardanibagh; Dayanand Balika High School, Mithapur; St Michaelâ€™s High School, Digha and Employment Exchange office located along the Bailey Road.

According to reports reaching here, the police seized a jeep at Bihta. Four people were arrested for different reasons in Bihta.

The polling centre located at the Wheeler Senate Hall (booth no 63) wore a deserted look because of the low turnout of voters. There were only 30 voters in this polling centre of the teachersâ€™ constituency. A large number of teachers of Patna University complained of the exclusion of their names from the votersâ€™ list.

12,HC pulls up Bihar ministers,"PATNA: The Patna High Court is likely to take up on Monday, Bihar government''s petition seeking withdrawal of the notice of contempt of court for not obeying its earlier order for payment of dues worth around Rs 1.18 crore to the teachers and non-teaching staff of SPM college at Udantpuri in Nalanda district.

The state cabinet had on Sunday decided to pay the dues to the college to avoid a constitutional crisis in the light of the contempt notice served on it by the High Court on April 26.

State Advocate General Shashi Anugaraha Narayan had on April 29 prayed before the bench of Justice Radha Mohan Prasad for recall of its order on notice for contempt of court as the state cabinet had already decided to sanction and disburse the amount determined by the Accountant General (Rs 1.18 crore) to the university for payment to the college employees.

The bench had, however, observed that as the matter had been fixed for May 6, any application filed by the state would be considered on the same day.

14,Policy moots increase in primary health outlay,"NEW DELHI: A national health policy, revised after almost two decades, aims to revive the ailing health system as it proposes to increase the primary health sector outlay and suggests a term requirement for medical graduates to PHCs.

The government has set for itself a goal of an increased outlay of 55 per cent in the primary health sector, 35 per cent in the secondary, and only 10 per cent increase in the area of specialised care. At the same time, it says it would encourage private sector participation, now limited to the profitable tertiary sector, in primary health care as well.

The Union health and family welfare minister, who released the revised health policy on Friday, said the last policy was formulated in 1983 and since then the health scene has changed dramatically requiring a more exhaustive approach. The policy was recently approved by the Union cabinet.

So, the policy envisages the setting up of an organised urban primary health structure to meet increased needs. It suggests a two-tiered structure, with the primary health centre providing the first tier and a second tier of a government general hospital.

For improvement of the public health infrastructure it suggests the following:

Revival of the primary health system by providing essential drugs.

Levying of user charges for certain secondary and tertiary public health care services for those who can afford to pay.

Expanding the pool of medical practitioners.

Simplification of the recruitment procedures for contract employment.

For funding and upgrading existing government medical and dental colleges, it has suggested setting up of a Medical Grants Commission. Even the curriculum, it has said, should be modified to make it more need-based.

It has suggested specialisation in public health, which has been a neglected area, both for medical doctors and non-medical graduates from allied fields.

To boost medical research, it has suggested that government-funded medical research be increased to a level of one per cent of the total health spending by 2005 and upto 2 per cent by 2010.

15,Environment dept clash over pipeline project,"MUMBAI: A controversial Indian Oil pipeline project for transporting hazardous chemicals in the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust area, has brought the environment departments of the Union and state governments into conflict.

The pipeline project will reportedly run through mangrove areas falling under the coastal regulation zone, where development is restricted.

While the project was cleared by the Union ministry of environment and forests in December 2001, it still has to receive clearances from the state environment department and the pollution control board.

But state environment officials say they are under great pressure to give the CRZ clearance without going through the proper evaluation process.

An official told this newspaper that there were seven to eight proposals for construction in the JNPT area which required CRZ clearance but had been pending for more than a year because the coastal zone management plan for the locality had not been finalised.

â€œBut suddenly, we were told to give this project top priority,â€™â€™ an official said. State environment officials point out that the Union governmentâ€™s clearance came just a few months after the application was made.

The ministryâ€™s clearance process usually takes a notoriously long time. The project, which is being undertaken by Indian Oiltanking, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corporation and Oiltanking Indian GmbH, a German storage terminalling company, involves transporting naptha from Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust to storage tanks in Navghar.

The contract was given to the company by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. This is not the first time the project is running into trouble.

Last October, the state government stopped work on the project after it was found that the project had commenced without getting permissions from various authorities.

The pollution control board had also issued a stop work notice. At around the same time, a public interest litigation was filed against the project by an NGO, EnvironSafe Foundation, which alleged that the pipeline would destroy mangroves and violate the CRZ rules.

â€œA pipeline cannot be allowed in CRZ areas unless it is meant for foreshore or waterfront activities,â€™â€™ says D.R.Rasal, a former member secretary of the pollution control board and now with EnvironSafe.

â€œIn any case, how could they start the project without getting the permission?â€™â€™ However, Indian Oiltanking refutes the allegations. Officials claim they did not start construction work before permissions were given.

â€œWe only invested in the pipeline and appointed the contractor,â€™â€™ said an official.

He adds that the pipeline follows an existing route where there are no mangroves.

The company, along with the environment ministry and ONGC, have filed a response to the petition, asking it to be dismissed. Company officials cite a risk assessment report done for the company by the Center for Earth Sciences, Kerala, an agency authorised by the central government.

The report concluded that there will be moderate adverse impact during the implementation of the project.

It records that the pipeline will be landward of the high tide line (construction is categorically forbidden on the seaward side) but will pass through the mangrove buffer zone, a protective 50 metre belt which must be maintained around any major patch of mangroves.

But if the project is carefully planned, the report says, and mitigation measures taken, the impact can be minimised and even reversed.

16,Plan body rues lack of development in east,"KOLKATA: The Planning Commission is worried about the skewed growth of the Indian economy that has led to a sharp divide between eastern states and the rest of the country. With Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa trailing behind others in all major parameters that indicate the robustness of the economy, the plan body hopes to find a solution to bring about an equilibrium.

â€œIndia moves forward in a divided way. While some states make substantial contributions to the gross domestic product, others fall to the wayside. This is not acceptable. The states in the east have to move forward. Otherwise, these large demographic entities will not allow India to chalk out the eight per cent GDP growth envisaged during the Tenth Plan,â€� Planning Commission member N.K. Singh told industry chiefs in the city on Wednesday.

However, the gloomy scenario that Singh advocated was based on outdated data. Referring to figures that were nearly five years old, the former revenue secretary hit out at the three pariah states for their substandard ranking in areas like poverty alleviation, growth in industry, growth in state domestic product, power usage, teledensity and infrastructure.

Parallel to the punches thrown at West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa were accolades for Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Singh even dismissed talk of the Gujarat riots affecting Indiaâ€™s GDP ambitions of 6.5 per cent in 2002-03. â€œThe events will iron themselves out and will not have any long-term effect on the economy,â€� Singh said.

While Singh admitted that neglect by the Centre was one of the reasons behind lopsided development, he said the states were also to blame for poor resource utilisation. â€œThe states in the east have poor fiscal management and governance. In the infrastructure indices, the states rank below most. All that needs to be changed,â€� he said.

Currently engaged in discussions with states to finalise the Tenth Plan, Singh and other members of the Planning Commission are trying to figure out if further incentives can be doled out to states that perform while slapping penalties on those that donâ€™t. â€œWe will definitely come out with innovative schemes and projects to allow backward districts and states to join the mainstream. But there are issues that need to be resolved,â€� Singh said.

These include growing fiscal deficit of the states, impetus for power sector development and reforms, agriculture reforms, urban sector development, accelerated irrigation activity and growth in GDP and its reflection in the index to human development. â€œKolkata and Bengal must revive its eminent status as a centre of learning and academic excellence. Human resource and knowledge power coupled with the arithmetic capabilities of the people in this region make them a great asset that needs to be harnessed,â€� he said.

17,City principals get a test of KQ,"KOLKATA: It was Eureka time for the principals of various city schools as the Archimedes of quizzing, Derek Oâ€™ Brien, took to the water to prove his theory.

Brien, the suave maestro of IQ, rarely does anything the usual way. So on Thursday at the Dalhousie Institute, he dropped his trousers for a pair of swimming bermudas, herded the eager heads of schools around the lovely pool and summarily showed what KQ could do to students.

â€œWe came to Kolkata at the end of our all India scouting, as the parents in the city are not all that keen on an experimental form of training involving a bit of expense,â€� said Oâ€™ Brien at the launch of his KQ School Advantage.

The specialized training programme has benefited 5000 children from schools in eight cities.

â€œI was never a bright student and it was my mother who assured me that there is not even any need to be one.What is important is a channelisation,â€� explained Oâ€™ Brien. So even as the school heads were being given an extensive demonstration of the KQ Advantage, trained experts of the programme were visiting schools involving the real participants.

KQ which for the uninitiated is the abbreviation of knowledge quotient, has now become a scale or frame of reference at par with IQ.

It was formulated with the help of a former professor of mathematics at the Jadavpur University, Deb Kumar Mitra in 1999 and has been patented at the US.

KQ score seeks to place the knowledge or skills of a child in relation to other participants, thereby helping the child know where exactly he is situated competitionwise.

It is not a negative indicator however as innate to the process is development of skills.

The process will immediately know which areas to focus on in the case of each child.

The skills measured vary from speaking well, people skills, creativity, memory, general knowledge, habits, reading and writing.

The gamut of areas is not very different from the traditional testers.

But all of it has been scaled and put in a microcosm of comparison.

â€œThe programme is actually a series of interactive video sessions wherein a trained colleague will be present in person to complement what I will be demonstrating or explaining on screen,â€� explained Oâ€™ Brien. Despite being sceptical about Kolkata parents and their eagerness for such innovations, the quiz master is all set to start the KQ advantage sessions at schools in the city from May 15.

The host schools are La Martinere for Boys School, St Jamesâ€™ School and MP Birla Foundation HS School.

18,"Trinamul, BJP may tie up for panchayat polls","KOLKATA: Kolkata mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Friday hinted at the possibility of a tie-up between the Trinamul Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party in the coming panchayat and municipal polls in the state.

He also admitted that the party had committed a mistake in the recent assembly polls by tying up with the Congress.

Mukherjee was talking to newspersons at the state secretariat after a meeting with state municipal affairs minister Ashok Bhattacharya. â€œThere is a strong possibility of a tie-up with the BJP the polls,â€� he said.

Admitted the partyâ€™s mistake in the recent assembly polls, he said,â€œWhen a mistake has been done, we should try to correct it when the time comes.â€�

The mayor strongly defended the partyâ€™s move to support the BJP on the censure motion in Parliament.

""Our move was politically correct. Since there were communal riots in Gujarat, we had demanded that the chief minister step down on moral grounds. At the same time, we could not have played into the hands of the CPM and Congress by supporting their motion,â€� he said.

Mukherjee felt that the Trinamul Congressâ€™ secular credentials were above question.â€œWe do not need to learn secularism from Sonia Gandhi. She is a newcomer to politics. What will she teach us, those who have been in politics for 30 years,â€� he queried.
