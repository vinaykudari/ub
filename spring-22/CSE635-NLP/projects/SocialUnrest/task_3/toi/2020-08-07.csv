0,PAC Jawans stop traffic to protest co-worker's death,"GHAZIABAD: About a hundred jawans of the Provincial Armed Constabulary stopped traffic at the Dabur crossing for over two hours, on Thursday morning. They had over 200 of their family members with them.

This demonstration came in the wake of the death of a PAC head constable, who was allegedly poisoned. Constable Devramâ€™s wife, Hansi, claimed he was poisoned by some PAC officers who had been borrowing large amounts of money from petty cash, without signing receipts for it. Devram was handling cash in the accounts department. â€˜The officers even destroyed the â€˜Yaadgarâ€™ register in which he made some notes on the details of the money taken,â€™ said Hansi. The total amount missing was reportedly close to Rs.5.90 lakh.

But, district police chief, Chandra Prakash, said, â€˜â€˜We learn that Devram was suspected of embezzling funds. And, he had been transferred to the 44th Battalion of the PAC, in Meerut. He was to join on Wednesday. So, he poisoned himself on Wednesday morning. He died in the hospital, at night.â€�

Claiming that senior PAC officials had falsely implicated Devram for embezzlement, the protesters demanded that Devramâ€™s wife and three children be allowed to stay on at the PAC grounds, and his next of kin be given his complete pension and other dues. The demands were eventually agreed to.

2,"BEFI, HMS protest against SC Verdict","KOCHI: The Kerala unit of the Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI), on Thursday said the Supreme Court verdict, banning strike by government employees, was against the ""logical and natural culmination of the collective bargaining process permitted by the law of land"".

Strike was often undertaken by a trade union as a last resort when all other avenues for a reasonable settlement of their genuine grievances were exhausted, BEFI Secretar, K V George, said in a statement here.

When the employer or the management failed to negotiate and discuss with the agitating workforce, they were then compelled to resort to higher forms of direct action, including strikes, he said.

The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, conferred this right to the workmen and their unions. The act also provided for institution of conciliation machinery under the Labour Ministry, who were empowered to intervene and prosecute the workers in the event of an illegal strike. There was no rationale to declare that even a strike, observed after complying with the due process of law, was ''illegal and immoral'', he said.

The chief vigilance officer of the GEB said that they have also arrested a number of their own employees who were caught red-handed.

Among them are Labhshankar Pandya and his son Nareshkumar Pandya from Kalol who had used sophisticated equipment to make changes in transformers. They were providing direct power supply to units like the Neelkanth Oil Mill at Mansa and the A-One Craft Paper Mill at Barejadi, which was not metered. Both units were found to be involved in theft worth lakhs of rupees.

The GEB has also arrested a gang involved in reversing meters and reducing readings for industrial units in the Makarpura GIDC. One of them, Haresh Shah is a GEB employee. They were caught red-handed while trying to tamper with meters.

The police officers recovered from the gang equipment used in reversing meters, nearly 30 duplicate GEB seals, 25 new meters, 18 old meters and six seal covers for meters. They have been accused of tampering meters of Jay Ambe Electrical and Shiv Plastics.

4,Farmers stay away from talks with Modi govt,"GANDHINAGAR: The second round of talks between the Gujarat government and farmers'' representatives failed to take off on Thursday as neither the Congresssupported farmer bodies nor the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) turned up.

The first round, for reducing the 2.5 times power tariff hike announced recently, had taken place on Wednesday. State revenue minister Kaushik Patel and energy minister Saurabh Patel waited for about half-an-hour, but as none of the representatives showed up, they left the venue at 12.45 pm.

""We will inform Chief Minister Narendra Modi about what happened in the negotiations on Wednesday. It is for the CM to take a final decision,"" said Kaushik Patel, while departing from the committee room of the Circuit House here, which was the venue of the negotiations.

""The Congress, and other organisations supported by it, had promised us on Wednesday to turn up for the next round. It seems they are not interested in talks. They just want to draw political mileage out of the tariff hike,"" he added.

Taking a softer view of the BKS, a RSS body, failing to turn up, Patel, who was earlier state energy minister, said, ""The BKS has requested us, through a formal letter, to give certain clarifications for taking the negotiations forward. We hope, they would return to the negotiating table within the next two or three days after they get our reply. However, the Congress, which has decided to go ahead with the agitational programme of August 8, is just interested in anarchy.""

When contacted, BKS spokesperson Kanubhai Patel said, the Sangh-sponsored farmers'' body has asked the state government to come up with a solution that would bring about a permanent solution to the problem of power tariff hike, linking it with remunerative prices for the farmers'' produce. After all, the farmers can pay in accordance with their capacity, not more.""

However, Patel refused to reveal details of the ""clarifications"" sought from the government.

Revealing the reason for failing to turn up for the negotiations, the BKS leader said, ""Ours is an organisation that genuinely represents farmers'' interests. Currently, sowing operations are on because of the rains. Our leaders are in the farms. We would need prior intimation for restarting the negotiations. Besides, one cannot increase power tariff and then start reducing it. This has no meaning. The government should first bring down the hike and then negotiate on what it proposes to improve the facilities for farmers.""

The BKS leader further said that the government must, without any condition, withdraw the fixed charges levied on the new power tariff, such as the five per cent electricity duty,which is over and above the Rs 1,200 per horse power per year fixed recently.

""Pending talks, our agitational programmes will continue.We plan to hold district-level rallies on August 11, against the hike. But we do not wish to create the type of anarchy that the Congress wants,"" he added.

5,RJD MP invites arrest for threatening DGP: Modi,"PATNA: Leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi on Thursday said that the statement of Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin that he would fight his battle with DGP D P Ojha after the latterâ€™s retirement and make him bite the dust itself amounted to criminal breach of order inviting arrest.

Modi said that Shahabuddin should be arrested under Biharâ€™s own law framed on the pattern of Pota so that he does not come out of the jail. Stating that he had links with international terrorists, Modi said that special responsibility devolved on the state government to arrest him so that faith in the public order and law enforcing agencies remained intact.

A separate case should be lodged against Shahabuddin in the light of his statement made against the DGP, and accordingly, he should be immediately arrested, Modi said.

According to him, earlier too, Shahabuddin had hurled threats at other officials in Siwan and Gopalganj to weaken their morale. These officials and police personnel included S K Singhal, Bachchu Singh Meena, Ashwini Kumar Sinha, Sanjeev Kumar, Sohaib Akhtar and Alauddin, Modi added.

Since the district and sessionâ€™s judge at Siwan had rejected his anticipatory bail petition, the state government is duty bound to arrest him in the larger public interest, Modi said.

He upbraided RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav for calling Shahabuddin his â€œyounger brotherâ€�, and also for his remark that no one should be deemed as a criminal unless proved so in the court of law. â€œAll this only helps in protecting criminals and causes weakening of the police morale,â€� Modi said.

As far back as 1999, a criminal, Nand Gopal Pandey, arrested in Rohtas, had claimed that of the 33 AK-47 rifles he procured from terrorists in a Kashmir village, Shahabuddin had purchased 10. The then Rohtas SP, A K Ambedkar, had submitted a detailed report on it to the police headquarters, but no follow-up action was made, Modi said.

In the circumstances, Modi made a fervent appeal to the DGP and other police officials to arrest Shahabuddin without coming under the pressure of Laloo, or without coming under the threats of Shahabuddin.

Modi said that people of the state were with them, since Shahabuddin was a threat to national security and also a threat to the public order in Bihar. The people of the state would never forgive Laloo for according protection to criminal elements, he added.

6,"State govt is anti-poor, say teachers","PATNA: Hundreds of government primary and middle school teachers, under the banner of the Bihar Non-Gazetted Elementary Teachersâ€™ Association (BNETA), sat on a daylong dharna at the Income-Tax roundabout here on Thursday.

Their main demands included promotion against the vacancies available, filling up of vacancies of school teachers across the state, the minimum pay-scale of Rs. 5000-8000 for primary teachers as per Central government rules and â€œmatric-trained pay-scaleâ€� to untrained teachers but having higher qualifications in the light of Fitment Committee recommendations.

The agitating teachers charged the state government with being â€œanti-poorâ€�. They said it was evident from the fact that during the last one decade a majority of the primary and middle school teachers were engaged in non-teaching jobs like electoral roll preparations, census work and polio vaccination drive, leading to the virtual closure of schools.

The figures do not include those Biharis who have passed the secondary examinations conducted by the CBSE and ICSE.

Jha said Biharis who have set-tled in Delhi during the last 15 years, particularly those belon-ging to the north Bihar region, have set up their own Khora colo-ny of 125 houses on the Delhi-UP border near Noida.

They have also built a guest house for providing accommodation to Biharis searching for jobs in Delhi, he added.

14,No threat to Assam govt: Gogoi,"GUWAHATI: Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Friday asserted that there was no threat to his two-year-old Congress government, claiming the BJP and its allies in the state were not in a position to repeat the recent political developments in Arunachal Pradesh.

Charging that the BJP had an unholy nexus with the AGP, Gogoi said that their electoral alliance in the last Assembly election had proved a complete failure as the people saw through their ploy.

Claiming that his government in the last over two years had been able to gain the confidence of the people, the Chief Minister said various developmental projects were taken up and the state''s economy was on the upswing.

15,Comedy of errors in court leads to cop's arrest,"MUMBAI: What happens if a suspect has to be produced in the court and he is in the toilet? The cops produce his father instead.

This is not a comedy scene from a Bollywood masala movie, but a real situation that occurred in the Mazgaon court on Wednesday.

The 17th magistrateâ€™s court had issued arrest warrant against Aziz Pittalwala.

Constable Anant Kadam, who was posted at the MIDC police station, was entrusted with the task of executing the warrant and bringing Pittalwala to the court. Asgarbhai accompanied his son to the court.

However, as there was some time for their turn to come, Pittalwala asked Kadam if he could go to the toilet. Kadam permitted him as his father stayed back with him. While Pittalwala was in the toilet, his name was called out and Kadam was asked to produce him before the magistrate. A scared Kadam produced Pittalwalaâ€™s father Asgarbhai before the magistrate.

However, the complainant, Pervez Khan, pointed out that he was not the person wanted in the case. The magistrate asked the cops to register a case against Kadam and arrest him. Judicial clerk Urmila Joshi became the complainant and filed a case with the Byculla police which registered cases under Sections 416 (falsifying evidence), 419 (impersonation) and 225 (negligence by a government servant through which the ends of justice are being defeated).

Kadam was arrested on Thursday and was released on a bail of Rs 5,000. Interestingly, Pittalwala reached the court room, but it was too late.

â€œI am seeing a case like this after ages,â€� says Ahmad Javed, Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order). He says that if Kadam is convicted, he will lose his job.

On a plea by advocate Dipesh Mehta, the Court allowed the Roshans and J Omprakash to amend their petitions so that the matter could be heard by a division bench as police had registered offences against them after completing probe as directed by a magistrate.

In view of this development, four petitions filed by the Roshans and two petitions filed by J Omprakash would now be heard together by a division bench comprising Justice Ranjana Desai and Justice V M Kanade.

Six cases of alleged cheating and criminal breach of trust have been filed by Jayantilal Gada of M/S Popular Entertainment Network against the Roshans and J Omprakash alleging breach of agreements for merchandising of films.

Earlier, the High Court had suggested that the parties go for an out-of-court settlement. Accordingly, they met on August, 6 but the compromise did not work out and they decided to follow the legal course.

The Roshans had entered into agreements with M/S Popular Entertainment Network for mechandising their past and future films, including ""Kaho Na Pyar Hai.""

J Omprakash also entered into agreements with the same company for marketing films made by him. However, dispute arose over payments.

21,Quiet reception planned for face of Gujarat riots,"KOLKATA: The narrow lane east of Park Circus maidan was oblivious of the spotlight awaiting them. Come Saturday, and Qutubuddin Ansari, the face of the Gujarat riots, would set up home there.

The news of his arrival has been kept under wraps. Even his would-be neighbours do not know that Qutubuddin is leaving Gujarat for good and would be living amongst them with his family. Qutubuddin''s tear-stained face and folded hands pleading for his life in the face of a mob during the communal riots, is etched in Rashid''s memory. ""He is coming to live in our mohalla,"" he exclaimed.

After the riots, wide publicity of Qutubuddin''s photograph made it difficult for him to move around in his hometown Ahmedabad. He was too scared to go out as he was easily recognised wherever he went. He shifted to Mumbai but that did not help matters either. Finally, he decided to take the offer made by West Bengal minister Mohammed Salim to set up home in Kolkata.

To keep him away from the media spotlight which had chased him out of his home in Ahmedabad, efforts are being made to keep all information about him under wraps.

""Members of various mass organisations have been working for the past month and a half to find a secure home for Qutubuddin. After he settles down here, we will help him find work according to his skills,"" said Salim.

A two-roomed rented accommodation has been earmarked for him. ""We collected money to the tune of Rs 75,000 to pay the advance for the flat,"" said Shanawar Hussain of DYFI. The Ganatantrik Mahila Samity have bought utensils and bedding for his family, said Jayshree Deb Nandy, member of the district committee of the women''s organisation.

Wahida Khatoon, who lives nearby, is eager to welcome the family. ""They would be too tired to cook dinner or breakfast the next day,"" said her husband Mohammed Ali. So, she has been asked to arrange for food for Qutubuddin''s family. And, Wahida does not mind. ""I often have to cook for my husband''s friend,"" she said.

Depending on whether they are used to having roti or chawal for dinner, Wahida would cook for the family.

Local businessman Mohammed Hashmat is eager to lend a helping hand to his new neighbour. ""When we heard of the riots, we could do nothing except feel sad. Now, I would be only too happy if I can do something to help them,"" said Hashmat.

On Saturday, a reception has been planned for Qutubuddin and family in the neighbourhood. ""After their horrifying experience in Gujarat, we want to make them feel at home here. We want to assure them that they are secure here,"" said Hussain.

Indicating that it would possibly monitor the trial of these cases, the court asked the Gujarat government to provide security to the witnesses. At least 41 witnesses had turned ''''hostile'''' in the Bakery case, resulting in the acquittal of 21 persons accused of burning alive 14 persons in Vadodara on March 1, 2002.

During the proceedings in a crowded court room, Zahira Sheikh â€” a key witness in the Bakery case who had turned ''''hostile'''' under pressure â€” also sought retrial of the case outside Gujarat, alleging that ''''crucial evidence was shut out through threats and intimidation'''' given on behalf of accused.

Converting the NHRC''s special leave petition as a petition in the public interest, a Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare, Justices S B Sinha and Arun Kumar asked the state government to submit within two weeks details of the statements made by the witnesses in the Bakery case both before the police and the trial court.

It also sought details of the grounds on which the state government had challenged the Bakery case judgment by a Vadodara fast track court.

Though the NHRC counsel said the Gujarat government''s appeal on the eve of the hearing of the NHRC''s petition was ''''an eyewash'''', the Supreme Court said ''''we cannot undermine our courts and the high court in Gujarat''''. However, CJI Khare said that the state government''s appeal in the Bakery case would not be allowed to be an ''''eyewash''''.

''''Furnish the grounds of appeal before us. If we find that it was a mere eyewash, we will allow the NHRC to intervene in the appeal before the high court,'''' said the Bench.
