0,PUCL's riot report indicts Baroda cops,"VADODARA: An independent report on violence in Vadodara following the Godhra carnage, released here on Tuesday has severely indicted the state government, the city police and local politicians for instigating and committing violence against the Muslims here. The report has been compiled and brought out by the People''s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and Vadodara Shanti Abhiyan (VSA) an organisation of city-based NGOs working together during riots. The report contains details and modus operandi of violence that started in the city from February 27, the day the Godhra carnage occurred. ""The report is based on a compilation and analysis of 1,800 forms filled by riot victims in the city"", says VSA member Rohit Prajapati. ""The aim of the report is to put on record what the man on the street had to say about the riots. The eye witness accounts of the riot victims and the people they saw instigating and committing acts of violence. Many of these accounts have not been lodged as FIRs as the police have not recorded them properly and in some cases the victims too have refrained from giving details out of fear,"" he said. The report names several policemen and prominent politicians as being party to the violence. The report gives detailed accounts of how violence occurred in city areas and the modus operandi behind each, it quotes locals enumerating who their attackers were. It also analyses the role of the city police. It enumerates women''s experiences during riots and a profile of the city and its history of violence. The PUCL has also come out with three other reports. ""Carnage in Gujarat - A public health crisis"" is a report on the medical condition in relief camps and provision of health care for riots victims. It also has a special report ""At receiving end - Women''s experience of violence in Vadodara"". The third report is ""Dateline Godhra"" drawn up by activist Jyoti Punwani and prepared by Nirbhay Bano Andolan. It tries to corroborate the theory that VHP volunteers travelling on Sabarmati Express on February 27 had misbehaved with a 17-year-old Muslim girl, which could have led to the attack on the train.

1,RLD threatens to withdraw from govt,"ALIGARH: Senior Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Tejpal Singh on Tuesday threatened that his party would pull its ministers out of the Mayawati government if it did not withdraw the case against a district panchayat official in connection with the attack on Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh.

â€œThe UP ministers belonging to our party would have no option but to resign from the government if the case against Tejveer Singh Guddu was not withdrawn,â€� said Singh, an MLA, addressing an indefinite dharna by party workers in front of the DMâ€™s residence here.

Tejpal said so far, his party has limited its agitation just to Aligarh but if their demand was not conceded then they would enlarge the stir across the state. Hundreds of RLD workers have been squatting outside the DMâ€™s residence here for the past four days. Three women party workers have launched an â€œindefiniteâ€� hunger strike.

Guddu was charged on June 17 with allegedly assaulting and seriously injuring noted environmentalist Rajendra Singh during a seminar here recently.

2,Police probe into farmers' deaths,"PATNA: The reports of four farmers committing suicide due to the failure of onion crops in the Jalla area of Patna City could not be confirmed as the police are yet to register a case of suicide for the death of Subhash Chandra Singh of Karamlichak village and Raghunath Mahto, Srawani Mahto and Ramchandra Prasad of Begampur village.

â€œThe family members of the deceased have not reported any case of suicide nor has anyone else,â€� stated an officer of the Chauk police station. However following the media reports, the police officials say that they would investigate the case.

Onion crops in the Jalla area have failed due to the unseasonal rain. The rain has had an adverse effect on the crops as unsold damaged onions can be seen lying at several places in the area, including those near the Patna Saheb railway station.

The state government is yet to come out with a statement on the issue. However, the state council of the CPI alleged that farmers are committing suicide because they are unable to pay the money taken as loan. It compared the situation with that prevailing earlier in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra when farmers there were forced to commit suicide.

The CPI asked the government to announce immediate relief to the farmers in the Jalla area. The state CPM has made a similar demand. Senior JD(U) leader Mundrika Prasad Yadav expressed his concern over the reports of farmers committing suicide in the Patna City area and demanded payment of Rs 5 lakh as compensation to each of the bereaved families.

3,Rly officials in a fix over minister’s remark,"DANAPUR: A piquant situation has arisen for the Railway Board over the statement of minister of state for railways, O Rajagopal, made on Sunday in Kolkata that the bifurcation of the Eastern Railway is not yet final.

Senior railway officials of Eastern Railway, on condition of anonymity, however, said that the ministerâ€™s statement was â€œunfortunate at this stageâ€�. Perhaps, it was made to placate a section of the agitating railway employees and local political leaders opposing the bifurcation.

Otherwise the entire procedure to bifurcate the Eastern Railway and make the newly-created East Central (CC) railway functional at Hajipur from October 1, 2002, came to an end with the gazette notification to this effect on June 14 this month, they said. According to sources, the move to set up a zonal office in Bihar was long due for the state. An old timer who had served the railways for considerably longer period, admitted that Bihar was alloted a zonal office of the railways soon after the countryâ€™s independence when Jagjiwan Ram was the railway minister.

But it could not materialise for one reason or other and as such, the zonal office of the Eastern Railway was then shifted to Kolkata, he said adding that the matter for opening a zonal office of Eastern Railway in Patna had branched up again during the tenure of L N Mishra, but to no avail due to his untimely death.

The sources said the present move to bifurcate the Eastern Railway and set the EC railway in motion at Hajipur, was not on overnight decision. In fact the Railway Reform Committee which was set up in 1981, had recommended creation of a zonal office of the railways in the state bifurcating the Eastern Railway.

Thus, re-organisation of the Eastern Railway was due for long in the state, sources said. Besides, the Railway Board and all technical experts had already given their consent to the issue of bifurcation of the Eastern Railway.

4,Rift in Rabri govt widens,"PATNA: The rift between cabinet and junior ministers in the Rabri Devi government took an interesting turn with ministers of state openly airing their views against the cabinet ministers.

â€œMinisters of state should form an association under the patronage of (RJD supremo) Laloo Prasad Yadav and expose the deeds of their cabinet ministers. Why is there a hue and cry raised by the cabinet ministers about the files pending with the ministers of state?â€� said minister of state for sports and youth affairs Monajir Hussain. Hussain has been at the receiving end of his cabinet minister Ashok Singh. He also demanded a vigilance or even a CBI probe into the role of cabinet ministers.

The sharp reaction of the junior ministers against their cabinet ministers is due to the remarks of health minister Shakuni Choudhary against his junior minister Akhilesh Singh for allegedly not forwarding a file relating to the transfer of 1,400 doctors. â€œThe file is not related to any policy decision to be taken by the cabinet minister. Why this hurry to get the file?

The file will be forwarded in due time,â€� observed Akhilesh. RJD cabinet ministers appeared to be evasive while replying to the questions relating to the growing confrontation with their junior ministers. â€œDifference of opinion between ministers is a normal thing in any democratically elected government. It should not be interpreted as confrontation,â€� said water resources minister Jagadanand Singh.

Minister for small and medium industries Ravindra Charan Yadav stressed that he has had no problem with any of his junior ministers. He pointed out that he has worked with high-profile junior ministers like Shyam Rajak. â€œAs long as there is no ego problem between the cabinet and state ministers, there is no hassle,â€� he remarked.

However, former minister Shankar Prasad Tekriwal said the confrontation between the cabinet and junior ministers is growing because the RJD chief is promoting it. â€œThis has become the order of the day,â€� he maintained.

Leader of the opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi stated that the jumbo-size Rabri ministry is facing internal contradictions because Lalooâ€™s authority is waning and on some occasions the RJD chief himself promoted them to keep a tight rein on some of his ministers.

â€œThe result is anarchy. Several key decisions like a new excise policy have not been taken due to this conflict, and this has cost the state revenue amounting to over Rs 100 crore,â€� Modi remarked.

5,Centre to decide on inclusion of SC/ST in list,"NEW DELHI: The Centre would now give the final decision on inclusion of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the SC/ST list.

This follows changes in the procedures for inclusion or exclusion of castes and tribes in the SC/ST list approved by the Cabinet Committee on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on Tuesday.

""The Centre will now have the power to accept or reject the recommendations from state governments in this regard,"" Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram said after the meeting of the Committee at the Prime Minister''s residence.

Earlier, state governments would recommend inclusion or exclusion of castes or tribes to the SC/ST list and the Registrar General of India (RGI) would examine the cases.

If the RGI was not satisfied with the explanation, it would send the recommendation back to the concerned state, which would again approach the RGI, Oram said, adding sometimes the correspondence would continue endlessly.

The minister said that with today''s changes, the RGI would now onwards refer such matters to the Centre for a final decision.

The Committee also approved the Minority Commission''s report and the related Action Taken Report to be tabled in Parliament.

Home Minister L K Advani, Human Resource Development Minister Murli Manohar Joshi, Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Satyanarayan Jatiya and Law Minister Arun Jaitley were also present at the meeting.

6,Troop pullout to be political decision: Army,"NEW DELHI: Stressing that no immediate pull-back of troops from the Indo-Pak border was being contemplated at present, the Army says any decision to de-escalate or thin out troops was a â€˜â€˜political decisionâ€™â€™ and would be taken by the government at the â€˜â€˜appropriate timeâ€™â€™.

The Army also feels that it is too early to conclusively establish whether infiltration across the Line of Control in J&K has actually come down. â€˜â€˜We will have to monitor the situation over a period of time before coming to any definitive conclusion,â€™â€™ said Army deputy chief (training and coordination) Lt-Gen R S Kadyan on Tuesday.

Speaking on the sidelines of a function to flag-off the fresh Army contingent earmarked to replace the existing Indian battalion with the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia-Eritrea (UNMEE), Lt-Gen Kadyan said the morale of the troops deployed along the border continued to be â€˜â€˜very highâ€™â€™.

Though the Army is in the process of re-starting some of the important training courses it had earlier deferred, this would not entail any sizable pull-back of officers and personnel from the border.

The deployment in itself is very good operational training, according to Lt-Gen Kadyan. Unlike Pakistan, India has no plans to scale down its UN peace-keeping commitment. India, in fact, might take on another peace-keeping mission in Congo after its experience in Lebanon and UNMEE.

India had sent 1,549 personnel to join UNMEE when it commenced in March 2001.

7,Youth charged in cheating case commits suicide,"BANGALORE: A 22-year-old youth from Bihar, caught in connection with a cheating case along with four of his accomplices, committed suicide in Karnataka''s northern district of Bidar, police said on Wednesday.

The man, identified as Sanjay, had visited some houses in Katakchincholi in the district on the pretext of cleaning gold jewellery in the absence of male members and either ran away with the gold by diverting attention of inmates or used some acid which led to melting of the yellow metal, they said.

On suspicion, villagers caught him and handed him over to police on June 21. There were similar cases reported in Bidar city also and subsequently his four accomplices, all from Bihar, were taken into custody from a city lodge.

Police said the five were taken to houses where they committed the crime and the inmates identified them but none of them came forward to lodge a complaint.

Sanjay, who was being questioned by the police last night, suddenly consumed a ""white substance"" suspected to be cyanide. He was rushed to hospital, where he was declared dead, police added.

8,"Militants say NC autonomy demand ""political ploy""","SRINAGAR: Two radical militant outfits on Wednesday criticised ruling National Conference for raking up autonomy issue terming the move as ""a political ploy aimed at just strengthening the roots of the National Conference in the state"".

Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen (JUM) and Tehreek-e-Jehad in separate statements said ''''acceptance of internal autonomy is out of question and disgrace for the militants who are struggling for complete freedom from India.''''

JUM termed NC as a ""black dot on the identity of Muslims"" and said ""priority of our jehad is to remove the black dot"".

""Without losing time activists of the outfit are eliminating NC activists and it is not worth our while to claim responsibility for it every time"", Deputy Commander-in-chief of JUM, Tahirul Islam said in a statement.

NC has damaged the ongoing struggle the most, Islam said, adding ""NC will never be forgiven for its betrayal.""

On Omar Abdullah assuming presidentship of National Conference, Islam said JUM has vowed not to allow these ""pro-Indians to remain in peace.""

Amir-e-alla (chief) of TEJ, Wasim Ahmad Beig termed NC''s demand of autonomy as a ""political card"".

""It is the result of historic betrayal of NC that innocents are being killed in Kashmir.. now NC wants to use the political card to win elections in the state"", Beig said.

He said, ""Kashmiris have not rendered the sacrifices of 80,000 people just for internal autonomy but for a complete freedom from India.""

9,All Karnataka ministers resign for ministry reshuffle,"BANGALORE: Karnataka Chief Minister S M Krishna would reshuffle his ministry Thursday after the ministers resigned en masse, giving him a free hand to carry out the exercise.

The ministers submitted their resignations at a meeting here in a development that capped two weeks of intense speculation over such a move to give a free hand to Krishna to undertake the ministry restructuring.

Senior minister K H Ranganath floated the idea of resignation by ministers to strengthen the hands of the chief minister and it was readily accepted by them, according to ministerial sources.

Ranganath, sources said, told his colleagues that the time had come for evaluating the performance of the government and the ministers ever since the Congress came to power in 1999.

This is the second meeting of the council of ministers convened by Krishna since last week to set the stage for the reshuffle of his 42-member ministry. Speculations were rife that the restructuring would happen last week but Krishna apparently put his plans on hold.

Krishna had indicated earlier that the ministry had to be recast to ensure representation to some sections and unrepresented regions, including new districts, such as Chamarajnagar and Udupi.

10,New industrial policy soon: Amarinder,"NABIPUR: The new industrial policy would be announced very soon, said Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh while talking to mediapersons at the Coca Cola factory here on Wednesday.

He said the committee headed by former chief secretary Ajit Singh Chatha had submitted its interim report to him and after considering its recommendations the government would announce the policy as soon as possible.

The chief minister said that efforts would be made to boost the small-scale industry in the state as this sector had immense potential.

He said it was sad that during the last two decades no efforts had been made to protect the interests of smallscale units.

He said that agro-based industry was the need of the hour in the state, which was going to diversify from the present wheat-paddy rotation.

Talking about the proposed closure of some boards and corporations under the disinvestment policy, Amarinder said that there were only a few such units where merely 600 persons were working.

He said if these units were closed the government would either adjust its staff or adopt the policy of ''''golden handshake"".

He said that running businesses was not the business of the government.

The duty of the government was to provide basic infrastructure for industrial units and his government was making all efforts to facilitate entrepreneurs, he added.

Later, Amarinder Singh flagged off an ambulance van donated by Kandhari Beverages to Rajindra Hospital Patiala.
