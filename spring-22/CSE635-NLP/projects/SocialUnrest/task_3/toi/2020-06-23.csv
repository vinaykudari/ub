0,Rains play havoc in govt office,"MUMBAI: For the past four days, the employees of the co-operative societies department in Malhotra House have been busy salvaging their office records rather than attending to the public. The sixth-floor office is flooded with rain water seeping in from the ceiling.

The office has records of co-operative societies registered in Mumbai and elsewhere in the state. Asked how 170 staff members worked in such conditions, an office superintendent merely shrugged and said, ""How do you think people can work? It is difficult even to sit here.""

The co-operative department works directly under the chief ministerâ€™s office.

1,Vapi policeman commits suicide,"AHMEDABAD: Uttam Vasantji, a head constable posted at Vapi police station, committed suicide on Saturday. In the suicide note, Vasantji held senior police inspector T T Chauhan responsible for driving him to take the extreme step.

Valsad SP P K Roushan has ordered an inquiry into the incident, which is to be conducted by DySP H K Gaekwad. Vasantji hung himself from the fan hook in the balcony of his residence in Valsad town.

Vasantji (45), who is survived by his wife and an adopted daughter,was â€œquite disturbedâ€� for the past few days and had requested for a transfer to a police station closer to his home in Valsad town.

When contacted, Roushan said, â€œHe met me a week ago and requested for a transfer, and I shifted him to Pardi police station.â€� Vasantjiâ€™s wife is a nurse in the civil hospital at Valsad. That is why he wanted to be posted closer to home. However, Vasantji could not join his new posting as he was not relieved by Chauhan.

In his suicide note, Vasantji stated that Chauhan caused him a lot of â€œmental torture and harassmentâ€� and feared that his senior would never relieve him.

Vasantji was posted in Valsad district for three years and was posted in Vapi police station for the last six months. Roushan said that before being posted out of Vapi, Vasantji was supposed to submit all case papers in his custody within a stipulated time. â€œIt seems that he could not trace one of the case papers, which got him anguished,â€� Roushan said.

He said that the investigations will now probe whether the allegations made by Vasantji are true. As of now,Vasantjiâ€™s case is being treated as an unnatural death, Roushan added.

4,'SAD-BJP candidate's papers rejected at minister's behest',"PATHANKOT: Even as more than 256 panchayats in Gurdaspur district have been elected unanimously and the election staff on duty has said the administration has not played any partisan role, former BJP minister Satya Pal Saini has alleged that papers of the SADBJP nominee for the post of sarpanch from Madhopur, Jagir Singh have been arbitrarily rejected at the behest of a Congress minister.

According to Saini, Jagir Singh was arrested on fake charges of theft by the Pathankot Sadar police but they had to release him after minister of state for external affairs Vinod Khanna took up the issue with district electoral officer KAP Sinha and SSP RPS Brar. The move was aimed at preventing him from filing his nomination papers, alleged Saini.

However, despite the fact that Jagir Singh managed to file his nomination papers on the last day, his papers were rejected by the RO without any reason even as he fulfilled all the clauses.

When contacted ADC (D) Bahadur Singh, who is incharge of the panchayat elections in Gurdaspur, he said papers of Jagir Singh were rejected on the ground that last time he was elected member of Jamalpur panchayat and before filing nominations from Madhopur village, he should have resigned from the Jamalpur panchayat post.

5,Unnitti takes up contract farming of medicinal plants,"PATHANKOT: Even as the Punjab government is yet to set up a medicinal plant board or Bio-Tech Park, a silent revolution to grow herbs and medicinal plants on commercial scale is taking place in Kandi areas of Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur districts.

The Unnitti Cooperative Marketingcum-Processing Society Ltd, Talwara, under the ongoing IWDP (Hills 11) programmes in Pathankot and Dasuya Kandi areas, has decided to go in for contract farming of medicinal plants in 150 acres of land. The society comprises of a number of scientists, agriculturists and environmentalists. While the IWDP (Hills 11) authorities act as facilitators, the Unnitti management is providing farmers with the seeds, technical know how and expertise.

Talking to TNN on Monday, president of the Unnitti Cooperative Marketing-cum-Processing Society, Jyoti Swaroop Sharma said, â€œWhile the wealth of medicinal plants in the Kandi area of Punjab has been receding over the years, with their increasing global demand we decided to grow these plants on commercial basis for the current season after the trials last year.â€� The agro climatic conditions of semi-arid and rain-fed areas of Dhar Kalan and Dasuya were most suited for these medicinal plants, Sharma said. â€œFarmers can enhance their economic status in these two districts and other submountenous regions of the state by taking to the cultivation of these medicinal plants.â€�

Unnitti makes buy-back agreement with the farmers of all their produce to sell the same to pharma units in the country and abroad. â€œTo begin with this year we have signed agreements with farmers to grow 150 acres of medicinal plants,â€� said Sharma. Unnitti Cooperative Society, which is negotiating a tie-up with Biosys Group of UK for cultivation of Amla in Punjab and HP, has also been engaged in procurement of Desi Amla available in the forests through farmer groups. â€œIf the MoU is signed, as the Biosys experts will be visiting us soon, we will go in for contract cultivation of Amla in a big way in the region,â€� said Sharma.

With the Centre for Advancement of Sustainable Agriculture (CASA), New Delhi guidelines as part of the global focus on organic farming, Unnitti will shortly start organic farming in the Kandi area as soil is least spoiled by fertiliser use as elsewhere in Punjab, added Sharma. Unnitti is also working in the field of biofuels. In a tie-up with the Punjab Government, a survey is being conducted in 125 villages of Ludhiana to grow castor, neem and crunj, which are rich in oil and could be used as an alternative to diesel, said Sharma.

6,PTU de-reserves seats by violating rules,"LUDHIANA: In gross violation of rules, Punjab Technical University (PTU) has de-reserved the hundreds of seats under the reserved category without seeking mandatory approval from the state welfare department.

The reserved category seats form 48 per cent of the total seats. As per the university notice published in newspapers, general category candidates would fill all the vacant reserved seats during the second phase of counselling tentatively slated for July 23. When asked, special secretary welfare department and incharge de-reservation branch, Harjit Singh told TNN over telephone that the university did not seek the approval as per rules.

The officials said that it was a serious anomaly on part of the university, as no seat can be de-reserved without the sanction of the department. The rules state that prior sanction was binding to effect de-reservation in respect of admission, recruitment and promotion. According to PTU registrar SK Bhatia, they took the decision in view of large number of seats remaining unfilled due to poor response from reserved category candidates almost every year.

â€œAgainst the quota of 2,200 seats for scheduled caste category alone, only 605 candidates have deposited fee so far.â€� Interestingly, Punjab SC/ST confederation general secretary Jasbir Singh Pal contested the claim saying that 935 SC candidates had appeared for counselling that concluded on June 13. Pal accused the university of discriminating against the reserved category candidates. He claimed to have exchanged heated arguments with certain PTU official on Monday about this.

Stating that this was not the first instance, Pal alleged that the university had recently acted against the interests of reserved category candidates by bringing about abrupt change in the fee payment schedule. As per the change, the candidates were asked to deposit the fee within five days of publication of a notice on June 18 but the same was not applicable to the general category candidates. The original date for depositing the fee was July 21. It was only after matter was highlighted by The TNN and his personal talk with the technical education minister Mohinder Singh Kaypee that the university announced the same fee deposit schedule for all categories, he said.

Kaypee had directed the secretary of technical education department to enquire about this. Bhatia said the reservation rules would apply to the 15 per cent admission quota granted to the managements of the affiliated colleges. The colleges would also charge as per the existing fee structure of the university, he said. The colleges would start admitting students from this session after submitting details of unfilled seats at the conclusion of the first counselling on July 16, Bhatia said, adding that the colleges must ensure merit based admissions.

8,Centre is anti-farmer: Ajit Singh,"HYDERABAD: Former Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh came down heavily on the Centre''s agriculture policy and said that his exit from the Union cabinet was the result of a ""continuous conflict"" with the finance minister and other BJP leaders.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, he alleged that the Centre was biased against farmers. ""Ever since I joined the NDA government, I raised issues concerning farmers. I had to confront the finance minister and BJP leaders at cabinet meetings whenever such issues were raised,"" he said.

The Centre has allocated Rs 2,201 crore for drought relief to farmers under the National Calamity Contingency Fund while Rs 2,869 crore was released for industrial development through financial institutions like IDBI for the benefit of a few industrialists. This shows the bias against the farming sector, he alleged.

Similarly, it has allocated Rs 22,000 crore for the restructuring of commercial banks, while totally neglecting the cooperative banks which provide 50 per cent of loans to farmers.

""This proves that the Centre is serving the rich and powerful sections rather than the needy,"" he alleged.

Singh contradicted the claims of the finance minister that subsidies for fertilisers have been increased and claimed that the Centre has actually cut down Rs 1,800 crore subsidy on fertilisers in the last three years.

Ajit Singh, who is also the president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal, said the Mayawati led BSPBJP combine in Uttar Pradesh would not survive for long as it did not have the required numbers for a majority. The 14-member RLD has recently withdrawn its support to the Mayawati government.

On the Ayodhya issue, the former Union minister said that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal were raking up the issue just for their existence as they have no other agenda to exist.

He also welcomed the efforts being made by the Kanchi Shankaracharya and the All-India Muslim Personal Board, to resolve the issue.

Conflicts over agri policy led to my exit, says Ajit ""The Centre has allocated Rs 22,000 crore for the restructuring of commercial banks, while neglecting the co-operative banks which provide 50 per cent of loans to farmers. This proves that it is serving the rich rather than the needy.""

9,BJP dharna for CBI probe into Marad violence,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Hundreds of BJP workers on Monday staged dharnas all over Kerala in support of their demand for a CBI probe into the Marad violence in Kozhikode last month that claimed nine lives.

Meanwhile, state BJP secretary P P Mukundan reiterated the demand for a CBI probe and said BJP would not co-operate with any government initiative including peace talks until the demand was met.

Talking to reporters here, he alleged that efforts were on to scuttle the crime branch probe by persons who wanted to protect the real culprits. A special police force to tackle the activities of extremists in the state should be set up, he said.

On the seizure of arms from various parts of the state, he said government should order a probe into it.

11,"Prepare for polls, Naidu tells ministers","HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has asked his cabinet colleagues to be prepared to face Parliament elections ahead of schedule.

He wanted them to speed up implementation of welfare schemes and target them better. The issue of Parliament elections figured prominently in the cabinet meeting chaired by the chief minister on monday.

Sources said Naidu told the ministers that there was â€œspeculation'''' that elections to the Lok Sabha may be advanced. The BJP-led NDA government was looking at the outcome of the Assembly elections to the four states later this year before announcing elections to the Lok Sabha, he reportedly said.

The chief minister''s statement assumed significance in view of his recent visit to New Delhi and interaction with Prime Minister Vajpayee. Naidu reportedly told the ministers to ensure that all programmes announced by the government were grounded immediately to preempt the election code of conduct.

The attention of the ministers would be diverted once the polls were announced and the elections to the state Assembly would follow subsequently, he said.

The TDP supremo, however, informed the ministers that the government still has 14 months and it is unlikely that he would go with parliament elections. The chief minister instructed the ministers to review the implementation of the schemes on a weekly basis.

The progress would be discussed in the cabinet. The issue of covering more castes in the welfare scheme announced by the government was also discussed and the cabinet subcommittee was told to prepare appropriate guidelines.

White ration cards would be distributed within two months after verification of the data collected by the multi purpose household survey and Velugu project team.

The government orders on the interest waiver on agricultural loans would also be issued before the forthcoming Janmabhoomi programme scheduled from July 1. Naidu insisted that the ministers attend the TDP extended-party meet scheduled on June 26 and 27 to discuss the government programmes.

12,Police arrest 3 in crackdown,"PATNA: Taking a lesson from the incidents of firing during political processions and rallies in Patna in the recent past, the Patna police on Monday undertook a special drive to arrest the criminals reaching the district collectorate premises in order to oblige their ""political masters"" on the last day of filing nomination papers for election to the legislative council seats.

In a dramatic move, the police arrested three persons, including alleged notorious criminal Salahuddin alias Tannu Mian, on the collectorate premises. ""Tannu was wanted by the police in many cases of murder and loot,"" said Town DSP R K Dubey. According to him, the police seized one countrymade pistol and six live cartridges from the possession of other two criminals.

Earlier, the administration had erected barricades at three different entrance points of the collectorate. Policemen were deployed in and around the collectorate in civil dress for identifying the criminals among the participants in different processions.

The police also ""detained"" two candidates, including one Sanket Gope, a resident of Phulwari area. ""He is an accused in at least six cases. We asked him to produce documents to substantiate his claim that he had been granted bail by the courts concerned in these cases. We got the papers verified and subsequently allowed him to go,"" said Dubey.

Meanwhile, officials at the Gandhi Maidan police station had to face a tough time in dealing with some aspirants for the Council seats. With folded hands, one candidate approached a senior police office to get one of his arrested supporter released, saying ""sir, MLC banana hai. Election pura swaha ho jayega (I want to become an MLC. The election prospects will be completely ruined by the arrest). My supporter''s arrest will send a wrong message among my followers. Please release him"".

Earlier, the police had arrested a mukhiya, Laxmi Roy, from the premises of district collectorate on Saturday.

The move of the police apparently yielded good results and supporters of candidates, carrying guns and rifles, hastily left the collectorate campus.

13,Togadia calls for Hindu party,"HYDERABAD: Coming down heavily on the BJP and Congress, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) international general secretary Praveen Togadia on Monday called on Hindus to float a party to protect their interests.

Talking to reporters here, Togadia said Hindu society cannot remain a political orphan for long and it was high time for Hindus to have a party of their own. However, the VHP would not float a party of its own, he added.

Hitting out at the Congress, he said any party which tried to hurt the Hindu sentiments would be defeated in elections. Citing the example of the Congress, he said whenever the party ignored Hindus it was routed at the hustings.

Criticising the BJP, the firebrand VHP leader said it failed to implement its core agenda saying that it had no mandate. â€œDid the party have majority at the time of the Rath Yatra undertaken by L K Advani?â€� he shot back.

Togadia warned that if the birthplace of Lord Ram was not handed over to the Hindus unconditionally, people would start an agitation which could change the course of national politics.

On Sunday, the outspoken VHP leader accused Prime Minister Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani of changing their stance on the concept of a Hindu Rashtra after coming to power. He said at a public meeting that the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site at Ayodhya would be the basis for re-establishing Hindu Rashtra in the country.

Commenting on Kanchi seerâ€™s parleys to settle the Ayodhya tangle, he said the nation had the right to know the details of the new formula suggested by the Sankaracharya.

He objected to the secret discussions to resolve the issue as it was not related to a private limited company.

Asked about the seerâ€™s remarks that the solution to the Ayodhya dispute would be found by July first week, Togadia said, â€œAll Hindu Sankaracharyas as well as we (VHP) are confident that a temple will be built at the birthplace of Lord Ram.â€�

â€œKanchi seer is our Sankaracharya and we have the highest regard for him, but unfortunately the seer does not know what the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office is doing,â€� he added. Any proposal that compromises the self-respect of Hindus would not be acceptable even to â€œour dead bodies and we want Ram temple at any cost and any methodâ€�, he said.

He rejected the idea of building mosque alongside the proposed temple at Ayodhya and said, â€œ that is the case, let them first build a temple near the Mecca masjid. it can be done, then we have no problem in allowing construction of a mosque at Ayodhya.â€�

Togadia said the VHP national executive meeting, to be held at Raipur on June 27 and 28, would deliberate on the future course of the agitation for the temple.

A meeting of sants, slated for the first week of July,would decide the course of the agitation. The VHP would ask its cadre to be ready for a prolonged agitation, he added.

14,Forces manhandled me: J&K minister,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Minister of State for Power Javia Mustafa Mir on Tuesday alleged that security forces manhandled him at Chadoora in Budgam district ""for protesting against their highhandedness with civilians"".

""The BSF and the Rashtriya Rifles were using abusive language and beating up the civilians at Chadoora. When I intervened, they entered into an argument and even pushed me around,"" he said.

Mir said he was trying to reason with the security forces to behave with the people as the Centre had promised good treatment with those not involved in militancy.

""People came out to vote (during last year''s assembly elections) and if this is what they are going to get in return things are not going to improve,"" Mir, who represents Chadoora assembly constituency, said.

He said he has filed an application at the concerned police station against the army major and informed the district superintendent of police, deputy commissioner and state chief secretary about the incident.

However, SP Budgam Satish Khandare said there was no untoward incident with the minister.

There was a cordon going on and Mir was stopped. When he identified himself as the minister, the matter was referred to the commanding officer who allowed him to pass through, Khandare said.

Defence PRO Lt Col Mukhtar Singh said he had no information about the incident.

15,18-year-old commits suicide,"NOIDA: An 18-year-old resident of Gautam Budh Nagar committed suicide on Monday night after failing in his mathematics paper.

17,BJP heading for political disaster: VHP,"RAIPUR: Reiterating his remarks on the need for Prime Minister Vajpayee to step aside, Vishva Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal said the Bharatiya Janata Party is heading for a political disaster if it continued with the â€˜â€˜politics of appeasement.â€™â€™

Speaking on the sidelines of the VHP meeting, Singhal said he hoped Deputy PM Advani would take the initiative and mobilise the BJP to get a Bill passed for building a temple at Ayodhya. It is better, he said, for the party to leave the NDA coalition and seek a fresh mandate on the issue.

Vajpayee, he said, had opposed Advaniâ€™s â€˜rath yatraâ€™ of 1990, which ignited the issue to the VHPâ€™s satisfaction. â€˜â€˜I have no hopes from Vajpayee,â€™â€™ Singhal said. He went on to blast the â€˜clandestine dealâ€™ Vajpayee is allegedly encouraging to compromise the Ayodhya issue, and give up claims to temples at Mathura and Varanasi as well.

And, he said, Vajpayee was compromising on another front â€” Pakistan. Restoration of bus and train links will only mean more terrorists coming in.
