0,Ministers may be asked to contest LS polls,"MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar and chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde have decided to kill two birds with one stone by asking ministers to contest the ensuing Lok Sabha elections from Maharashtra.

Both the leaders will be forced to drop many ministers from the cabinet as a result of an amendment to the constitution which restricts the size of the cabinet to 15 per cent of the strength of the legislative assembly. Mr Shinde will be required to bring down the number of ministers from 69 to 43 after June 1.

Instead of waiting for the deadline, both the Congress and NCP, who are the main constituents of the Democratic Front (DF) coalition, have decided to downsize the ministry well in advance and ask the ministers to contest the parliamentary polls.

However, both Mr Shinde and Mr Pawar face the difficult task of preparing the list of ministers whom they want to axe. Most ministers are reluctant to forgo the perks of their office.

Also, it is felt that the political climate is not in favour of the DF government in the state and hence the possibility of their winning the LS polls are rather slim.

According to informed sources, cabinet minister Laxman Dhoble (NCP) may be asked to contest from Pandharpur, which is now represented by Republican Party of India (RPI) leader Ramdas Athavale. Minister for tourism Jaidatta Kshirsagar (NCP) is actively being considered for the Beed seat.

Controversial minister for civil supply Suresh Jain (NCP) has already expressed his desire to contest from his backyard, Jalgaon. In any case, social activists want him sacked from the ministry for alleged corruption. Minister of state for revenue Ramraje Nimbalkar (NCP) may be fielded in Satara.

Minister of state for home (rural) Kripashankar Singh (Congress) is being considered for the Mumbai North constituency against petroleum minister Ram Naik of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

In view of the fragile health of Prakash Patil, who represents Sangli, the Congress is toying with the idea of fielding industries minister Patangrao Kadam.

1,"State free of bird flu, says minister","HYDERABAD:The bird flu virus, which had hit poultry in Pakistan, has not touched the state, according to animal husbandry minister Nimmala Kistappa.

The Centre has banned the imports from Pakistan and measures are being taken to prevent smuggling of chicken and eggs into the country, the minister told reporters on Friday.

Meanwhile, medical and health minister Kodela Sivaprasada Rao, in a statement, said that the chicken meat and eggs were free from bird flu virus in the country. The management practices adopted in the poultry industry in the country, particularly in the state, are very much advanced and comparable to that of developed nations, the minister said.

He advised the public not to compare the Indian poultry with that of Vietnam. He said that the eggs and chicken could be eaten without any inhibitions as the Indian poultry is absolutely free from any such disease that has spread panic in other Asian countries.

Rao said that the Indian style of cooking, which involves deep frying and hard boiling, is safe. ""Since the food items are cooked at temperature above 70 degrees Celsius, all types of bacteria or virus get eliminated.

2,Parked trucks come in handy for anti-socials,"HYDERABAD: Trucks being parked on the road beside the Nampally railway shed are being used by some anti-social elements to carry on their activities unhindered.

Local people allege that one can see over a dozen trucks parked on the road either in the day or night, and the same have become a safe place for some people to indulge in anti-social activities.

The trucks are parked on the back side of the Nampally railway station. The road connects Yousufain Bazar and City Criminal Courts complex at Nampally.

The trucks occupy better part of the 30-feet wide road and hinder traffic movement.

If not the drivers or cleaners of the trucks, others gather at the spot in evenings for gambling.

The place has become a permanent parking lot for lorry owners and a safe place for gamblers and miscreants. One can see people drinking sitting in and under the lorries everyday.

The gamblers fight among themselves and create nuisance for people living in the vicinity. These people also tease road users, particularly women. They flung empty liquor bottle at passers-by and beat up those who dare to object to their activities.

Women rarely dare to walk on the road due to the presence of these anti-social elements. J Mahender Reddy, a resident of Red Hills,who uses the road to go to his shop in Moazam Jahi Market as he can save 10 minutes since it is the shortest route, says: ""Even I am scared of using the road in the night,"" he said adding one cannot guess what happens as the anti-social elements are on the prowl all the time.

Mohammed Saifullah, a resident of Yousufain Bazar, said the place is not only used for gambling, but some people also use it for prostitution.

""We complained to the local police several times, but nothing has been done to rein in the anti-social elements,"" he added.

The police should swing into action immediately and put an to this nuisance, Saifullah said.

3,2 women lawyers murdered,"HYDERABAD: Two women advocates were done to death by unidentified assailants at different locations under the Vanasthalipuram and LB Nagar police stations limits on Friday.

Police suspect that sexual jealousy might have led to the murders.

The two â€” identified as Swarnakumari, 32, and Satyavathi, 27, residents of Pratapnagar in Chintalbasthi near Khairatabad â€” were practising advocates at the Nampally criminal courts. Satyavathi had joined Swarnakumari as an assistant four days ago, according to the Cyberabad police.

Police said Swarnakumari was killed by slitting her throat and cutting off her nose with a knife in an open plot in survey number 60 at Devakamma Thota under the LB Nagar police station limits. Satyavathi''s body was found strangulated with a rope at an isolated place near the Matrushri Engineering College at Nadargul under the Vanasthalipuram police station limits.

The bodies were found within three km of each other. Both were found with their black capes on. Passersby noticed Swarnakumari''s body at 9.45 am while Satyavathi''s body was found at 10.45 am, the police said.

While Swarnakumari''s husband Yedukondalu is a police constable with the Santoshnagar police station, Satyavathi''s husband Vamsi Krishna is a software engineer with a private firm in Ameerpet. She was married three months ago.

Clues team and fingerprint experts collected evidence from the spots where the bodies were found.

Cyberabad police commissioner M Mahender Reddy, deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Krupanand Tripathi Ujela and other senior officials visited the spot.

Inquiries by the police have revealed that Swarnakumari and Satyavathi left the Nampally criminal courts on Thursday at around 3.30 pm informing their colleague Rupa Singh that they were going to a court in Bhongir to attend a case.

""We suspect that sexual jealousy might have led to the incident. We are questioning Yedukondalu to collect some information about his wife,"" Mahender Reddy said.

4,Bharti to ring $400 million equipment deal,"NEW DELHI: Bharti is expected to announce up to $400 million worth of equipment contracts for its cellular services (Airtel) over the next few days.

Bharti has decided to sign up Ericsson, Motorola and Siemens as its main vendors â€” both for expansion of the existing 15 telecom circles as well as setting up new projects in six circles for which it has bought licences. Bulk of the funds will go for expanding existing networks.

â€˜â€˜Bharti is looking at investing about $400-500 million over the next 12-14 months and up to 80 per cent of it could go into cellular projects,â€™â€™ said a source familiar with the negotiations. â€˜â€˜The final value of the deals will depend on a range of issues that are still being discussed,â€™â€™ he said.

Ericsson will be the biggest gainer from the contracts because it already supplies telecom equipment to Bharti in 10 circles. Of the rest, three circles are with Motorola.

These will be three-year contracts and the first one is expected to be signed with Ericsson, according to sources. â€˜â€˜This contract may be about $250 million,â€™â€™ said one source. Ericsson is also looking at contracts to operate, maintain and upgrade networks, which will be over the equipment deal. Setting up infrastructure in the six circles is expected to cost about $100 million. Sources said the exact details of who gets how much and where are still being worked out and the final deals would depend on several factors under consideration.

The expansion as well as new networks will be EDGE (enhanced data rates for GSM evolution) capable, to allow high speed data and video on mobiles, an area all phone companies are looking at for enhancing revenues.

6,'Amend laws for women',"LUCKNOW: Everybody wants a Tulsi, a Sita, a Parvati or a Savitri and all our laws and parliamentary Acts support status quo in maintaining this social construct, perpetuating the myth of these self-effacing paragons of virtue.

Realms have been written in praise of the ''sacrificing, coy Bharatiya nari'' wherein the aspiration of every woman is supposed to emulate and mould herself according to this patriarchal model of the good girl. Symptomatic of the winds of change is the fact that in 2001, 36 per cent women opted for being single as opposed to 4 pc in 1947.

Arvind Jain, advocate, Supreme Court during a workshop on ''Women and Law'' organised by the philosophy and women''s studies department said that to meet the new needs of emancipated women these antiquated laws had to be overhauled. Otherwise, the trend of dysfunctional families would continue as women would refuse to be the ''second sex'', he added.

""Most of the laws relating to inheritance, adoption and divorce are geared to protect the patriarchal system of male hegemony. It is not as if the law-makers have inadvertently forgotten to plug these lacunae. They are there for re-interpretation and exploitation by lawyers. A gender-sensitive approach cannot be expected when they are made by male parliamentarians and interpreted and executed by a male-dominated law enforcement agency,"" he said.

A UN report suggests that 98 per cent of the world''s property is controlled by men. The inheritance laws continue to exemplify the ''male preference''. The Hindu Undivided Family Act ensures that only the male members are a co-partitioner of property. It is only in case of a male patriarch dying without making a will that the family property shared with the mother, daughters and wife.

Again the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act ensures that the perpetrator or client goes scot-free while the victim or prostitute is prosecuted.

7,Courts can't rule on extended Session,"NEW DELHI: Though a section of the Opposition parties in Parliament is contemplating moving the Supreme Court against the Lok Sabha Speaker''s ruling allowing the Vajpayee government to go ahead with the extended winter session, various provisions of the Constitution prohibit judicial interference in the proceedings of any law-making body.

Under the Constitution, the Speaker of a legislative assembly or the Lok Sabha is the sole authority to conduct the proceedings and his orders shall not be open for judicial review.

But wherever the Speaker passes an order as a quasi-judicial authority, such as under the anti-defection law, his order is open for judicial intervention.

Speaker Manohar Joshi''s ruling on the government''s motion to place the interim budget is not a quasi-judicial verdict, but a parliamentary approval.

It was CPM''s Somnath Chatterjee who threatened to move the court against Speaker''s ruling, citing a verdict of the Kolkata High Court. Though a lawyer himself, Chatterjee has not followed through his declaration, making political circles suspect that he might have given up on the idea of seeking judicial intervention.

Article 85 authorises the President or governor, as the case may be, to convene the session, prorogue it or dissolve the House on the expiry of its term or on the advice of the council of ministers.

8,Sangh pressure causes delay in BJP chief selection,"GANDHINAGAR: The Sangh Parivar''s rather strong pressure in favour of a person who could in check the Narendra Modi government and also ensure coordination with the Sanghâ€™s different components led by the RSS has emerged as the main stumbling block for the failure of the BJP high command to have a new state party chief. In fact, increasing number of party leaders have begun to say that, but for the Sangh, a decision would have been taken by now.

Though the current party chief, Rajendrasinh Ranaâ€™s term expired a year ago, senior party leaders in the state are still unsure when the crucial decision might be taken. â€œIf a decision is not taken by Tuesday, things will be pushed to well beyond the Lok Sabha pollsâ€�, said a top BJP leader, admitting, â€œThe high command perhaps does not want to risk a man if he causes a factional rift before the polls.â€�

In fact, the hope of state party leaders over a decision in the matter in Delhi -- where top Central leaders met on Friday to anoint M Venakaiah Naidu as the next BJP president -- were dashed as nothing happened. State party functionaries were keeping a close watch, with some even saying -- â€œwho knows, something might happen.â€�

Indeed, the opinion on who should be the next state party president, remains as sharply divided now as was several months ago. This despite the fact that several state BJP leaders concede, the high command has short-listed two names -- ex-agriculture minister Purshottam Rupala and the current revenue minister in the Modi cabinet Kaushik Patel.

Rupala''s name has the sanction of Modi yet, powerful Sangh lobbies consider the ex-agriculture minister as too much of an independent person. â€œSangh is the main hurdle, lest why couldn''t Rupala''s name be announced till now is not clearâ€�, said a senior leader.

A strong opponent of ex-CM Keshubhai Patel, Rupala failed to make it to the state cabinet under Keshubhai in 1998 as he failed to get a crucial Sangh sanction.

Coming from Amreli district of Saurashtra region, Rupala has never made two bones about why he couldnâ€™t win a poll in the December 2002 assembly elections. A novice in politics, Paresh Dhanani of the Congress defeated Rupala with a huge margin allegedly due to caste politics played under Keshubhaiâ€™s guidance. Rupala is a Kadva Patel, and majority of the Patel voters in Amreli are Leuva Patels, a community to which both Keshubhai and Dhanani belong.

Say party sources, the Sangh may not have specified any names, yet ""favours"" Kaushik Patel, whose relations are â€œreasonably goodâ€� with Modi, Keshubhai and the Sangh. â€œThe Sangh wouldnâ€™t, there-fore, object to Kaushikâ€™s nameâ€�, a senior party leader said, adding, however, â€œWhy his name has not been agreed upon is Modi wants a man at the top whom he can trust better -- preferably Amreli MP Dilip Sanghani, or else Rupala.â€�

Party sources say, after the recent turmoil surrounding the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) campaign against Modi -- which could be solved only after the active intervention from top Sangh men led by senior RSS functionary coordinating with the NDA Madandas Devi and Union law minister Arun Jaitley -- the Sangh has become particularly wary.

â€œIt was with great difficulty that Sangh could convince Modi about the need to concede to the BKS demand to slash the hiked power tar-iffâ€�, a senior party leader said. â€œHence, to have an independent minded person known for his guts to sidestep the Sangh -- Purshat-tam Rupala -- as party chief may be risky.â€� The need, therefore, from the Sangh angle, is to have a person who could put the government in check and coordinates with the Sangh.

10,Rohini case: Husband arrested for murder,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police have arrested the husband of Sonia (22) who was found murdered in her house in Sector-5, Rohini on Thursday evening.

Ashwani confessed before the police that he had strangled his wife for having an extra-marital relationship. Deputy Commissioner of police (north-west) Sanjay Singh said: â€˜â€˜Ashwani was arrested from near Sanjay Gandhi Hospital on Friday. He told the police he killed Sonia on Wednesday after he found her in a compromising position with her former employer.â€™â€™

The special team constituted after the murder had conducted raids at various places. The police had also positioned their men at bus stops and railway stations.

Ashwani told the police he had got married to Sonia in 1999. After living in Yamuna Nagar for two years, the couple moved to Delhi with their two daughters, Singh said. While Sonia joined Rama Finance Company in Vardhman Complex, Pitampura, Ashwani too took up a job.

Three months ago, he started his own audio cassette shop. Although Sonia left her job, she reportedly developed a relationship with her employer.

â€˜â€˜Ashwami claims he suspected his wife was having an affair but never spoke of it. On Wednesday, however, he confronted Sonia. There was an argument following which he killed her,â€™â€™ Singh said.

11,Feel-good Sonia ready for her share of political hugs,"NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday rubbished the NDA claim to go to the polls making Prime Minister Vajpayee their USP saying, ""Vajpayee is all that they have. What else do they have to show?""

Her bristling comment, along with numerous others, made with broad smiles and even occasional giggles, came at the lunch she hosted for the media at her residence.

Acutely conscious that the Bofors gun could fire both ways as it had done with regard to her husband Rajiv, Sonia made it clear that it would not become a poll issue, even if the BJP wanted to make it.

The latter part of her comment was in the context of her accusation that ""they have not given up (on Bofors) for years; they will not give up"" trying to prevent the formation of an alliance of Opposition parties. Who were â€˜they'' and was she referring to Mayawati? ""Ask Mayawati,"" Gandhi said.

Congressmen realise that if they are not careful the issue could prevent the formation of a pre-poll national Opposition alliance to match the ruling NDA. That alone could guarantee a reckoning in Rashtrapati Bhavan''s assessment for the Opposition, assuming that the general elections would throw up a â€˜hung'' House.

Asked how she would deal with some of her husband''s critics, who are now her allies, Gandhi said, ""I hope those who are with us have regretted (their past stand). But now we don''t have to look at the past. We have to move on.""

She also ridiculed the ''dynasty'' charge, since practically every BJP ally was practising it. She even mentioned the Chautala, Bansi Lal, Naidu and Abdullah families.
