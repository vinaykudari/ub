The complainantâ€™s brother was recently involved in a rioting incident at Tunga village in Powai. The police had registered a FIR against him. However, Munde approached the family and demanded a bribe of Rs 7,000 for not taking action against the accused. The first instalment of Rs 1,500 was paid to him at the police station on Sunday.

1,Baranagar youth commits suicide over results fear,"KOLKATA: Arindam Nandy was convinced he would not score more than 60 per cent in his Higher Secondary physics paper. Unable to share his feelings with his parents and depressed at his performance, the 18-year-old decided to end his life. Arindam was found hanging in his house Atapara in Baranagar by his father on Monday evening when he went to call his son for tea. Additional SP (Barrackpore) K. Jairaman said Arindam was a student of the Ramakrishna Sangha Higher Secondary School.

On Monday evening, he was resting in his room on the first floor. Around 6.30 pm, his father Pulak Nandy, a state government employee, returned from office and called him for tea. But, there was no reply. He went up to find the door locked. Breaking open the door, he saw his son hanging from the fan. According to Jairaman, a suicide note was recovered where the boy said he had expected to score 80 per cent in physics. But, after the test he realised that he could not get more than 60 per cent, which would not help him fulfil his ambition.

Meanwhile, officials of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education denied rumours that the chemistry paper for Tuesdayâ€™s Higher Secondary examination had been leaked on Monday morning. They said it was just a â€œhoaxâ€� and part of a â€œtutorial racketâ€�.

Initial reports from Burdwan and Midnapore on Monday suggested that chemistry question papers were being sold in several places. Later similar rumours were heard in the city as well. â€œWe told our regional offices in Burdwan and Midnapore to send a copy to us. On checking, we found that the whole thing was a hoax,â€� council secretary Dibyendu Chakraborty said.

2,No special court to impose DJB laws,"NEW DELHI: In the absence of a special court to deal with the offences related to water supply, the much hyped water conservation plans of the Delhi Jal Board continue to suffer.

DJB is the only civic agency in the city which does not have a court to deal with some of the most recurring offences like tampering of water supply, pilferage and contamination.

All other civic agencies, like the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and New Delhi Municipal Council, have special courts to deal with disputes related to their services.

â€˜â€˜We avoid taking offenders to regular courts which are already burdened with cases of more serious offences,â€™â€™ says P K Tripathi, the chief executive officer of DJB. â€˜â€˜Long dates, long wait and adjournments etc are the limiting factors for prosecuting offenders,â€™â€™ Tripathi said. Though he admitted that a dedicated court was the need of the hour.

Unlike planned cities like Chandigarh, where use of drinking water for the purpose of washing cars is an offence, it is not so in Delhi.

An attempt to separate drinking water from garden water has not been successful here. â€˜â€˜We tried to supply separate water, from Yamuna, for using it on cars and lawns in some areas of the NDMC. But the river water is so polluted and stinks unbearably that people stopped using it,â€™â€™ said the DJB spokesperson.

â€˜â€˜The law enforcement is also very lax. For instance we donâ€™t have any law on the misuse of water in the Delhi Jal Board Act, 1999,â€™â€™ says standing counsel of the DJB Gita Mittal.

â€˜â€˜In fact very few cases reach the court. The amendments in the Act were suggested about two years back. But they are still pending before the legislature,â€™â€™ the standing counsel said.

Legal experts feel the initiative of setting up special court lies with the government. â€˜â€˜It is upto the Delhi government, whose chief minister also heads the board, to approach the Delhi high court if it is serious enough to curtail offences and ensure water conservation and safety,â€� said high court advocate R K Saini. Only the high court can appoint magistrates, he added.

But there are some people who feel harsh measures like court cases on people should be avoided. â€˜â€˜The special court will certainly help containing the supply loss, but still we have some soft corner for people which keeps us from taking action,â€™â€™ said boardâ€™s vice-chairman Shadi Ram, who is also a Congress MLA.

6,"Bihar ready for VAT, says minister","PATNA: Biharâ€™s commercial taxes minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui on Tuesday made it clear at the meeting of the empowered committee of state finance ministers in New Delhi that the state was ready to implement the value-added tax (VAT) system. â€œI said at the meeting that Bihar was ready to enforce VAT on April 1, 2002 itself.

But due to politicisation of the issue, the Centre itself has not been able to go through the formalities of enforcing the system,â€� he said while speaking to TNN. He pointed out that the Centre had mentioned implementation of VAT in its budget declaration, but the BJPâ€™s national executive was opposing it.

He, however, said that the implementation of VAT in Bihar would be meaningless until its neighbouring states, including UP, implemented it. â€œI also pleaded that the turnover threshold limit for registration of traders under the VAT system be increased from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per annum and compounding of taxes be done above Rs 25-lakh mark to protect the interests of small businessmen,â€� he said.

â€œI also advocated the removal of the clause stipulating a jail term of upto three years for the erring traders,â€� he added. He said he had pointed out at the meeting that Bihar had sent its draft Bill on VAT to the Centre on March 13 after the cabinet approval. But the Union government had sent about one dozen queries. â€œI saidthat the Centre should respond fast to the replies sent by the state to it.â€� Over 20 states had sent their draft Bills to the Centre.

However, states like Himachal and Delhi are yet to send in their draft Bills. He also pointed out that the Centre was yet to make amendments to the laws related to central sales tax.

7,HC raps govt on water,"PATNA: Bihar State Housing Board MD was directed by the Patna high court on Tuesday to furnish by April 29 the details about the water supply pipes of Bahadurpur housing colony and other colonies, since contaminated water is being supplied to the residents and that too in inadequate quantity.

Hearing on a contempt of court filed by the Council for the Protection of Public Rights and Welfare for non-compliance of earlier order , for the supply of pure drinking water in adequate quantity to Patna residents, a division bench comprising Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice R S Garg sought details on when the water supply pipes were laid, from where they were purchased and since when they have been functioning. The MD reiterated his stand that the BSHB has already handed over the water supply of Bahadurpur colony to Patna Water Board.

The PWB representative present in the court submitted that water supply of Bahadurpur housing colony is entrusted to it, but since the BSHB had laid down inferior quality of supply pipes, they got worn out beyond repair and replacement is the only solution for the supply of pure water in adequate quantity.

The bench observed that the pipes would be examined to ascertain whether they were supplied as per specification or not. In a PIL filed by RJD leader Chandrika Prasad Yadav another division bench issued notices on Tuesday to the secretary of the cultural ministry, ASI and the Bihar government to explain within two weeks the steps taken by them for the protection of archaeological spots. of rich heritage.

8,Kidnapping case: Minister gets arrest warrant,"PATNA/GAYA: With a Gaya court on Tuesday issuing non-bailable warrants of arrest against junior minister for excise Surindra Prasad Yadav and two others in connection with the kidnapping case registered against them at the Rampur police station of Gaya, there was hectic activity at 1, Anne Marg in the state capital.

RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav rushed back to Patna from New Delhi to take stock of the situation. According to RJD sources, Laloo has asked the minister to resign. However, Raj Bhavan sources stated that the resignation letter of the minister had not been received till late Tuesday evening.

Earlier in the day, additional chief judicial magistrate of Gaya issued non-bailable warrants on an application moved by the Gaya police. Apart from Surindra, warrants were issued against MLC Azad Gandhi and Pappu Yadav, brother-in-law of Subhash Yadav, who is the brother of chief minister Rabri Devi. The case was registered under Sections 364, 341, 224, 225, 353, 323, 324 of the CrPC and Section 120(B) of the Indian Penal Code.

The minister is alleged to have played a key role in the kidnapping, wrongful confinement and torture of three policemen and an accused, Atul Prakash, in transit from Gujarat to Bihar. The case took another new turn around Tuesday midnight with Gaya police arresting the sub-inspector of Patna Kotwali, Rama Kant Ram, and two constables Neyaz Khan and Mahendra Singh, who took Atul Prakash to the residence of Surindra Yadav in Gaya instead of bringing him to Patna where a criminal case was listed against him (Atul). Sources from Gaya also indicated that action is also likely against some police officials of Patna district for allegedly conspiring with Subhash Yadav and Azad Gandhi in getting a case registered against Atul Prakash and also showing overenthusiasm in sending police team to Vadodara for bringing Atul to Patna.

They further said that warrants of arrest would also be procured against two persons â€” Mohan Srivastava, private assistant of the minister, and Bachcha Rai, an associate of Pappu Yadav and Subhash Yadav, both MLCs. The sources further said that the role of some police officials who supervised the case is also being examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether these officials also conspired with the two MLCs and the minister in getting a case registered against Atul at the Kotwali police station in Patna under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. The loyalty of these officials to the MLCs is suspected from the fact that to expedite the arrest of Atul, who was staying in Anand in Gujarat, these police officials sent sub-inspector Rama Kant Ram and the two constables to Gujarat by plane. The police team left for Delhi by plane and from there they were sent to Vadodara by AC first class in Rajdhani Express.

Likewise, the police team returned to Delhi by plane on April 2 and from there travelled to Gaya in AC first class in Rajdhani Express. Police sources suspect that Atul was involved in money laundering. About two years back, Atulâ€™s brother had withdrawn a sum of Rs 1 crore from the Raj Bhavan branch of the SBI in Patna before the clearing of a cheque.

9,"GO 94, Pota jolt for govt","HYDERABAD: The retreat made by the government on the controversy surrounding its new recruitment policy and the Pota case against a Congress legislator within a gap of less than a week, exposed the lacunae in the administration and caused acute embarrassment to chief minister Chandrababu Naidu.

Senior officers recalled that, never in the recent past, the government was caught on a wrong foot and made such an about turn on its decisions. In the past, Naidu had successfully withstood the agitation against the hike in power tariff and other issues. Even before the government could recover from the embarrassment it suffered due to mishandling of Pota case involving Congress legislator Konda Surekha and her husband, the chief minister had to bow to the pressure from the student groups and unemployed people and withdraw the order on its new employment policy.

The officials are pointing fingers at principal finance secretary S K Arora, who was instrumental in drafting the GO 94 on new recruitment policy consequent to the directive of the High Court which was seized of cases pertaining to jobs involving at least half a dozen government departments. The GO, even though purely administrative in nature, should have been discussed by the cabinet before approving it as it involved lakhs of unemployed young men, a senior minister felt. Top government sources told The Times of India that the draft order was approved by Naidu at the instance of the officer without much discussion.

Even in the case of Pota also, the decision was taken by a police officer in the absence of the chief minister, who was away on foreign tour. The government did not anticipate such a strong reaction and resentment from the student community, as most of the guidelines announced in the GO are part of existing recruitment policy. The government was apparently alarmed when large number of students took to the streets.

During the initial stages, the government wanted to put up a strong defence of its job order, but on noticing the lukewarm response from cabinet ministers and party leaders, who were hesitant to defend the order, the chief minister thought it fit to withdraw the GO. Naidu held a meeting with Arora and other senior officials on Tuesday morning before leaving for Visakhapatnam and after discussing the pros and cons, decided to withdraw the order.

The general administration department is expected to issue another order replacing the GO 94. A section of officials felt that the government should have filed an affidavit in court on the new policy. Referring to the fiasco, a top government official said â€œboth these incidents show that every thing is not well with the administration and it is better for the chief minister to put the house in order.â€�

10,Partial response to PW bandh,"HYDERABAD: The statewide bandh called by the Peopleâ€™s War on Tuesday to protest the encounter killing of its senior leader P Sudarshan Reddy alias RK last month had little impact in urban areas, while normal life was affected in rural areas.

The naxalites resorted to large-scale violence on Monday night as a prelude to the bandh, blowing up a railway station in Anantapur, torching buses and other vehicles in Kurnool, and damaging government property in Guntur and Warangal districts.

Reports reaching the state capital said the bandh had a partial impact in Warangal, Karimnagar, Adilabad, and Nizamabad, all extremist-affected districts, while it was business as usual in the twin cities,Vijayawada,Visakhapatnam, Guntur, and Tirupati. The state transport utility, APSRTC did not operate buses in the extremist-affected areas. A report from Kurnool said the bandh was partial in villages where the PW has a hold. In Anantapur, where the naxalites blasted a railway station at Narayanapuram, the bandh had a partial impact.

The bandh did not have many takers in north coastal Andhra. Meanwhile, a 29-year-old fair price shop dealer, Gopal, was shot dead by Peopleâ€™s War naxalites on Tuesday at Chandracharla village in Kanaganipalli mandal of Anantapur district.

11,Criticism forces state govt to scrap GO 94,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The controversial GO 94, which decreed that all future government recruitments would be on contract basis, has been withdrawn. The decision was announced by the chief minister on Tuesday while speaking to reporters at the Vizag airport en route to Sabbavaram mandal to participate in a Jalachaitanyam programme.

Naidu said: â€œWe issued the GO with a good intention in view of the poor financial condition of the state. As the unemployed are opposing the GO, we will withdraw it.â€� All recruitment would continue to be done as in the past, he said. Launching a scathing attack on the Congress for politicising the issue, the chief minister said, â€œThey (Congress leaders) are distorting every government decision.â€�

He said that when the Congress was in power, it had miserably failed to address the unemployment problem. It was only after the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) came to power that as many as two lakh teacher posts were filled, attaining the very desirable teacher: student ratio of 1:40, he claimed, adding that the state governmentâ€™s innovative employment policies had become a role model for other states. The Joint Action Committee of Students and Youth Associations has, however, described the withdrawal of GO 94 by the government as a victory for students organisations which had agitated against the decree.

The JAC, which includes the Students Federation of India (SFI), Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), All-India Youth Federation (AIYF), All-India Students Federation (AISF), National Students Union of India (NSUI) and Progressive Democratic Students Union (PDSU) said their agitation forced the government to withdraw the GO.

12,SC pulls up Maya govt on Dalit issue,"NEW DELHI: The ""pro-dalit"" Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh has been severely criticised by the Supreme Court for acting against the legitimate rights of landless scheduled caste and scheduled tribe people in the state.

While upholding the right to own village land by a landless labourer belonging to the deprived class, the court expressed ``surprise''''at the fact that the state government and its revenue officials had challenged the labourer''s entitlement before the high court.

``It seems to be a clear case of non-application of mind on the part of authorities concerned... who are supposed to effectuate the socio-economic objective of the legislation'''', a Bench of Justices K G Balakrishnan and P Venkataraman Reddi said. About five years ago, Manohar petitioned the apex court against the Allahabad high court which had deprived him of 2.45 acres of `gaon sabha'' land which he had been cultivating for about 15 years then.

The Sub Divisional Officer had allotted him the piece of land under the relevant provision of the UP Zamidari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, section 122B (4F) of which says that a landless SC/ST was entitled to possession of the land if he was continuously in its possession prior to June 30, 1975. Manohar had been cultivating the land for about 15 years when he applied for its ownership in 1990. Later, the state government challenged the allotment and got it cancelled.

The apex court has dealt with the legislation and its objective. It said it was the bounden duty of the concerned revenue authorities to make necessary entries in revenue records to give effect to the statutory mandate of the Act. The Board of Revenue and the high court should not have cancelled the allotment made in favour Manohar, the Bench said while restoring possession of land to the petitioner.

""You should not expect me to usurp the authority of the review committee. I have taken cognizance of the allegations,"" Advani said replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour.

Shabana Azmi (NOM) asked Advani whether it was true that many were booked under Pota for the Godhra carnage but no one was arrested for the ""bloodshed"" that followed in Gujarat.

This led to charges of misuse of Pota by many opposition members with Manmohan Singh (Cong) questioning the reason for a change in the government affidavit in the Supreme Court on the issue of arrest of MDMK leader Vaiko under Pota.

Advani said the Centre had constituted the review committee in the wake of allegations of misuse of the act.

""I am sure this review committee will take a comprehensive view of the entire gamut and even make recommendations if it feels so,"" he said.

Though standing by the controversial Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act, which was also voted by the MDMK in Parliament, attorney general Soli J Sorabjee said that the Centre''s earlier affidavit was ""based on a misapprehension of the stand of the government of India"". He requested the court to treat as deleted paragraphs 12 and 13 of the said affidavit that justified Vaiko''s arrest.

Addressing a Bench of Justices S Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur, currently hearing arguments on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of controversial Pota, Sorabjee clarified that ""the speech delivered by Vaiko....If properly interpreted and read in the entire context of the speech and the surrounding circumstances does not attract the provisions of section 21 of Pota"".

In its first affidavit filed on March 28 last, the Centre supported Tamil Nadu government''s decision to invoke Pota against Vaiko.

It had said that by giving a public speech in support of banned LTTE, Vaiko had committed an offence under section 21 of Pota.

Vaiko has challenged the validity of section 21 of Pota contending it violated his fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 (1) of the Constitution.

Nair, is pitted against AICC''s official candidates Vayalar Ravi and Thennala Blakrishna Pillai for the April 14 Rajya Sabha poll.

21,Infighting takes backseat as Cong protests war,"MANGALORE: About 4,000 Congressmen led by AICC general secretary Ved Prakash and KPCC president B. Janardhana Poojary took out a protest rally organised by the Dakshina Kannada District Congress Committee to condemn US attack on Iraq.

This is the second time after Poojary assumed office as KPCC president, that the local Congress leaders, including MLA Vijaykumar Shetty, KPCC general secretary Manjunath Bhandary, DCC president Blasius M. Dâ€™Souza, KCDC chairman Kallige Tharanath Shetty, Mangalore mayor Shashidhar Hegde, MUDA chairman Tejomaya among others shared a single dais, amidst the factional politics in Congress in the district.

Addressing partymen, Poojary lambasted the Union government for failing on all fronts, be it outright condemnation of US aggression on Iraq or the massacre of Kashmiri Pandits due to cross-border terrorism.

â€œThe Centre has clearly projected itself as weak, spineless and voiceless, instead of showing a brave and daring stand to categorically condemn the attacks,â€™â€™ he said.

â€œWhile the governmentâ€™s stand on the US-Iraq issue is rather â€œdisheartening,â€™â€™ despite the resolution to condemn the attack, as a responsible opposition, the Congress is committed to the cause of humanity and United Nationâ€™s Charter resolution, and hence through a protest rally wish to send a message to the world community that India unitedly condemns the US aggression and that global terrorism propagated by the US cannot be toleratedâ€�.

23,Special tickets for pardafaash rally,"LUCKNOW: The Railways have started taking token payment for booking tickets. But, hold on, you do not fall in the slot. The special arrangements are available only for those close to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).

The BSP has booked four special trains with the Northern Railway to ferry party workers to Lucknow for the proposed pardafaash rally from different parts of the state. The trains will ply between Lucknow and Meerut, Saharanpur, Ghaziabad and Varanasi.

An advanced payment of Rs 6 lakh was made for the trains earlier this month. The total cost of hiring four special trains, at the rate of Rs 4.5 lakh each, however, comes to around Rs 18 lakh.

When asked what happened to the balance of Rs 12 lakh, a Northern Railway official said: â€˜â€˜Rs 6 lakh is just the token payment. The full payment for the service has to be made at least two days in advance.â€™â€™

But, interestingly, the Northern Railway is yet to receive the payment for the special trains it ran in the aftermath of the stampede after dhikkar rally on September 28.

â€˜â€˜We cannot risk the lives of people for a few lakhs. Special trains would be run. We hope the payment will be made sooner or later,â€™â€™ the official said.

As for the previous payment, he clarified that the bill had been raised and sent to the railway ministry for approval.

Further, the railway authorities are clearly set to cover that extra mile to satisfy the BSP. Apart from arranging special trains, railway officials here are finalising other details, too.

On Tuesday, DM Navneet Sehgal and SSP A K Agarwal met DRM (NR) R K Bansal to finalise the details of crowd management on the D-day. According to sources, two of the four special trains will run from the Manak Nagar railway station to avoid over-crowding at the Charbagh railway station.

To further avoid congestion at the Charbagh railway station, the staff will stop dumping parcels at the station from a couple of days in advance.

For those not boarding the specials, additional ticket counters are likely to be set up. It has been assessed that more special trains may be required, sources say. But until the rally organisers make such a demand, the railways will not do anything on its own, added sources.

However, the authorities are geared up to meet any eventuality.
