0,Delhi govt housing on shaky ground,"NEW DELHI: At a time when the cityâ€™s politicians are on an inauguration spree, the state government is doing little to resolve the housing problem of its own employees.

There are about 95,000 employees in Delhi government, but the available accommodation is for only 6,602 people. Worse, for its ministers. Due to lack of official accommodation, three state ministers are living in private houses and even for secretary level officials, there is a crunch of C and D category houses.

A senior official said: â€˜â€˜Even the available accommodation is located in far flung areas of north, northwest and west Delhi. Commuting to office is a problem and affects the work performance.â€™â€™

Urban development minister A K Walia said his ministry has raised the issue time and again and has requested Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to provide some land for construction of houses. But instead of providing land, the Central government took our houses.â€™â€™

Walia was forced to vacate the official accommodation at Deen Dayal Upadhaya Marg and had to move into his house in east Delhiâ€™s Bharti Nagar following an eviction order from then Union urban development ministry.

A senior official said: â€˜â€˜Due to inadequate housing, the satisfaction level is poor among the staff, many of whom are always interested in getting a transfer nearer their house. The situation particularly applies to our women staff, who are in a hurry to leave office by 5 pm.â€™â€™

The officer said the government cannot provide accommodation to everyone, but if it gets the land from the Central government, atleast housing for women staff can be resolved to some extent.

Walia said a demand has been made for providing eight acres of land on Deen Dayal Upadhaya Marg in and around ITO as the area is close to most of the Delhi government offices. â€˜â€˜We plan to construct multi-storeyed buildings and provide housing to ministers and officials there,â€™â€™ he said.

Some government officials complained that the Delhi government lacked farsightedness in creating residential properties in posh localities of south and New Delhi, which other civic bodies like the MCD, DDA and the NDMC have done, surprisingly.

1,"32 cases solved, 3 arrested","NEW DELHI: With the arrest of three persons, the south district police claimed to have solved 32 cases of burglary and theft in the city. The police said stolen goods, including gold and diamond jewellery, worth over Rs 8 lakh had been seized from the accused.

The arrest has reportedly helped police solve the robbery which took place in the house of a private television channel employee in the Malviya Nagar area earlier this year. â€˜â€˜A special team had been constituted to nab the criminals after many such incidents were reported in the district. The modus operandi of the accused was closely looked at and all clues about their whereabouts were followed which led to their arrest,â€™â€™ stated deputy commissioner of police (south) Vivek Gogia.

The three were arrested at their hideout in the Sarai Kale Khan area after a tip-off was received by the police. The police said that the main accused, Bholu, was a resident of Kolkata.

The accused allegedly used to hire an autorickshaw to reach their target. They would bundle all the stolen goods in a bed sheet and flee.

2,Women not safe in govt offices,"NEW DELHI: The helpline operated by the Delhi Commission for Women has been getting some rare calls this year.

According to figures available with the department, cases of sexual harassment from within government departments have shown an increase this year. â€˜â€˜Last year we hardly had any case from government departments, this year we have already received 9 cases from them,â€™â€™ said a counsellor.

Although nine cases may not seem like much, but the point to remember is that these cases have already been examined by committees set up in the respective departments. â€˜â€˜Evidently, the verdicts of these departmental committees have not satisfied the victims, hence the cases are referred here,â€™â€™ said a senior legal adviser with the Commission.

Three of these case are from the transport department of the Delhi government, while two are from the education department. Two cases are from the Delhi Development Authority and one case each from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Safdarjung Hospital.

â€˜â€˜People think that since government jobs are secure, finding witnesses to testify in cases of sexual harassment in government departments is easy, but that is not so,â€™â€™ said the legal adviser.

â€˜â€˜It is difficult to get people to testify, especially in cases where the harassment has been verbal, as in the cases from the education department,â€™â€™ she added. In most departmental enquiries, it was found, both parties had been punished. â€˜â€˜This is unfair, as the perpetrator is equated with the victim. In many cases, both have been transferred out,"" she said. The message that goes out is that both parties are at fault.

DCW chairperson Anjali Rai, however, does not find anything significant in the rising number of cases from government departments. â€˜â€˜Government offices, like other places are inhabited by humans, these things happen,â€™â€™ she says.

She adds that it is not that sexual harassment has exploded in government offices. â€˜â€˜It is just that thereâ€™s been a rise in the reporting of these cases. Delhi, anyway, has a bad record when it comes to crime against women,â€™â€™ she says.

4,Lok Ayukta's notice to ex-minister,"LUCKNOW: Lok Ayukta Justice SC Verma has issued show cause notices to a former BJP minister and two IAS officers for contempt of court, favouritism and forging government documents.

In a case relating to allotment of kerosene depot in Gorakhpur, Justice Verma has pulled up former revenue minister Ravi Gautam, principal secretary revenue Dinesh Rai and special secretary Chandra Nigam for issuing a GO in violation of a high court order.

RS Yadav, a resident of Gopiapar in Basti, had filed a complaint with the Lok Ayukta alleging that a kerosene oil depot in Gorakhpur was allotted to one Sangeeta Singh fraudulently. Yadav had alleged in his petition that Sangeeta, a resident of Barhalganj Gorakhpur, had given fake and misleading information in her application.

Despite giving a fake address, she was allotted the depot. Failing to get a reprieve from the authorities, Yadav challenged the allotment in the high court (case No 33145/2001). The court, in its order dated November 13, 2002, had sought cancellation of the allotment.

But the then revenue minister Ravi Gautam and the revenue department officials went out of way to help the woman. Ignoring the high court order, they issued a GO (3908/1-9-2002-76-4LC) dated December 18, 2002 verifying the address given by Sangeeta Singh to uphold allotment in her favour.

Inquiries made by the Lok Ayukta revealed that the special secretary Chandra Nigam had claimed that legal opinion was sought from the law department and the order was issued only after getting approval from the then revenue minister Ravi Gautam and principal secretary Dinesh Rai.

During the course of investigation, the Lok Ayukta office, however, found that either no legal opinion was sought or the law department was not properly briefed about the existence of the high court order dated November 13, 2002.

â€œIt seems the minister and the revenue department officials deliberately ignored the HC court order and verified the address for some extraneous reasons to help the allottee while the allotment was illegal as per rules,â€� observed the Lok Ayukta in his report.

When the Lok Ayukta sent the report to the Mayawati government, the fraudulent allotment was finally cancelled on May 9, 2003 by the orders of the then principal secretary Sujit Bannerji.

Taking serious note of the matter, the Lok Ayukta has shot off notices on September 5, 2003 and sought explanations from the former revenue minister Ravi Gautam, Dinesh Rai and Chandra Nigam for ignoring the court order and faking notings to shower favours.

â€œItâ€™s a clear case of contempt of court. Those officers who gave importance to ministerâ€™s orders to defy the court order will find it difficult to explain,â€� stated a senior officer at Lok Ayukta.

6,Telgi's trade got govt 'stamp',"HYDERABAD: The fake stamp paper racket prime accused Abdul Karim Telgi, was given authorisation by the stamps department way back in August 1995 to sell non judicial stamps with the help of Sadashiv alias Siva.

The business was carried out in the name of M/s Venkateshwara Enterprises, but Telgi stopped trading between December 1998 and January 1999 due to harassment by two men, Shyam Sunder Prasad and Raju Srivastava.

After apparently settling the issue, he started trading in stamps in February 1999. He was arrested later in the year.

Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said that Telgiâ€™s gang was involved in about 27 cases in nine states.

7,"Woo the voter, watch the party","HYDERABAD: The TDP is going for a two-way mirror strategy to pull in the votes. The party plans to nominate public relations coordinators who will double as watchdogs in its latest image building exercise.

While developmental activities taken up by the government would help get fifty percent votes, good PR will help it get the balance of fifty percent votes, Chandrababu Naidu told partymen here on Tuesday. â€œGone are the days when slogans would fetch votes,â€™â€™ he said.

So, from September 12, the party would have one representative per 100 voters, or 35 families, the chief minister said. These representatives will try to build up relations with the public by giving them a view of the partyâ€™s activities. At the same time, these representatives will turn their attention back on the TDP and observe party activities.

They will give â€œobjective reportsâ€� to the leadership every fortnight about the functioning of MLAs, ministers from the districts and the minister in charge of the district. The report would contain the problems in party activities, suggest solutions and the action taken to rectify any defect. The report would also pick out issues which involve financial clearances and would inform voters on the various developmental and welfare schemes taken up by the government. This information would be an important tool to work out party strategy and strengthen it where ever necessary before next elections, Naidu said.

In their PR role, the representatives would have to spend about 10 minutes with each family.

They should find out the problems, note them and create confidence that they would be attended to. Target neutral voters, get closer to them and win them over Naidu told partymen.

8,MSR may fly northward to election states,"HYDERABAD: Former PCC president M Satyanarayana Rao, who flew to New Delhi on September 5 following summons from the party high command, is likely to be appointed as party observer in one of the four northern states where Assembly elections are slated to be held soon. He is likely to head the state election committee of one of the four states.

Rao, who met some of the senior most leaders of AICC during his visit, is likely to go to New Delhi in another weekâ€™s time as he could not meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi during his stay in New Delhi. Sonia was busy with her trip to some of the northern states.

When contacted, MSR told The Times of India that he had not gone to Delhi seeking any post. â€œI went to meet my friends not for a post in AICC,â€� he said.

9,Fake stamps racket busted; 8 arrested,"GUNTUR: Police on Tuesday busted a fake judicial stamps racket and seized court fee stamps and welfare stamps, all worth Rs 5.5 lakh, from the eight-member gang.

The arrested persons include Ambati Rammohan Rao of Eluru, Sesham Venkateswarlu of Darsi in Prakasam district, Ramesh (a Vijayawada-based printer), Srinivasa Rao (a stamp vensor based in Chilakaluripet), Thota Murali, Pinapati Wilson, Yesudas and Mallela Chandramohan (all from Guntur).

District SP Ravishankar Ayyanar told reporters on Tuesday that a person named Hakeem, resident of Kolkata, has been identified as the kingpin of the gang who was circulating fake judicial stamps in the state through a network in various districts.

In fact, the Hyderabad task force police had arrested Hakeem in Dec. 2002 and six of the eight members arrested on Tuesday, in March for selling fake judicial stamps. All the accused, who succeeded in getting bail, then shifted to Guntur. The police had then seized fake stamps worth Rs 7.5 lakh from them.

Curiously, one of the accused Sesham Venkateswarlu said that the task force police had earlier arrested and set him free without seizing the balance fake stamps.

The Guntur police have registered cases against all the accused under the AP Organised Crimes Control Act (APOCCA). The SP said that Hakeem supplied fake judicial stamps to Ambati Rammohan of Eluru who established connections with Sesham Venkateswarlu of Darsi, a former employee of APSRTC and others. An Ongole court had suspended the licence of Srinivasa Rao as stamp vendor on suspicion for supplying fake stamps. Later, the gang started printing stamps locally with the help of printers.

However, the SP clarified that the racket had no connection with the Karim Lala gang which is involved in the fake stamp paper scam.

10,Five pseudo naxalites arrested,"HYDERABAD: Shivampet police on Monday arrested a five-member gang of pseudo naxalites and recovered 5.5 tolas of gold, 20 tolas of silver, a watch, an electric motor and five jungle patch uniforms from their possession.

Sadu Anjaneyulu, 30, a resident of Allikpur; Karre Srinu, 22; Chintakindi Gopal, 21; Dakuri Pochaiah, 22, an auto driver and Mangali Mallesham, an agricultural labourer, were the pseudo naxalites who were arrested.

Of the five, Anjaneyulu was a Peopleâ€™s War sympathiser and was involved in the murder of Tammali Hanmaiah, a resident of Bramhanapally, who was suspected to be a police informer.

On June 15, the gang along with one Nimmala Narsimlu demolished a Baptist Church at Allipur village. A case is pending at the Shivampet police station in this regard.

On April 12, Anjaneyulu, Srinu, Gopal and Pochaiah went to the house of one Muramshetti Yadagiri of Venkatapur village in Kowdipally mandal and beat up Yadagiri, his wife and daughter. They took away gold ornaments and cash worth Rs 30,000.

The gang was also reportedly involved in may extortion and robbery cases. On April 4 this year, they robbed a rice mill owner, K Satyanarayana at Mangalparthy of Rs 500 and a watch.

In another incident, on August 28, Anjaneyulu along with Chintakindi Gopal, Dakuri Pochaiah and Manne Laxmia, who is a resident of Venkatapur, went to the Mahalaxmi Binni rice mill belonging to Vanjara Narsimha Rao at Bramhanapally in Narsapur Mandal armed with axes and extorted Rs 7,500 posing as extremists.

The five gang members were remanded to judicial custody on Tuesday. The arrest was undertaken by Shivampet sub-inspector R Ramchander.

12,Pre-surgery chemo increases survival rates,"HOUSTON: Researchers after 11 years of extensive study, have found a new standard of care that involves chemotherapy first and then surgery for advanced bladder cancer. Advanced bladder cancer is a tobacco-related disease, which is very difficult to treat.

In a study of people, with locally advanced bladder cancer -- tumors that had invaded the bladder walls or nearby tissue, but not other organs -- those who received a combination of four drugs before having their bladders removed had a median survival of 77 months, as opposed to 46 months in patients who had surgery alone.

""Treatment of this disease varies across the country, but we believe neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be used more frequently to treat patients with locally advanced bladder cancer,"" says study''s principal investigator, H Barton Grossman, MD, professor of urology at M D Anderson Center in Houston.

The study will encourage the use of a combined treatment: chemotherapy and surgery in patients who are at high risk. ""Most patients treated with advanced bladder cancer today receive only surgery, and for many that means loss of the bladder. The new regimen would mandate chemotherapy first to shrink the tumor followed by bladder-sparing surgery.

Bladder cancer is a major public health concern both in the US and worldwide. The disease affects about 57,000 people a year, according to the American Cancer Society, and is responsible for about 12,500 deaths. The disease is also the fourth most common cause of cancer in men and the eighth most common in women.

The bladder cancer is worst in the countries, where cigarette smoking is most chronic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has targeted bladder cancer as one to be eradicated over the next few decades. WHO estimates the disease annually affects 330,000 people worldwide.

The new analysis, which involved 307 patients, showed that about three years of survival could be added to the lives of patients. And, the patients treated with surgery alone were 66 per cent more likely to die than those who received combined treatment.

The median survival for patients who received chemo and surgery was 77 months, the study showed. While for those who got surgery alone, median survival was only 41 months.

The forms of chemotherapy administered in the project, involved drugs commonly used in the treatment of a variety of cancers: methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin, commonly known as M-VAC.

Results of the study, which Grossman hopes will unify the standard of care nationwide, is reported in August 28 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

""This study does demonstrate that there is a potential for longer survival,"" Grossman says.

According to Dr Grossman, ""People are not so familiar with bladder cancer and its direct link to smoking. People usually think of lung cancer when a smoking-related cancer comes to mind.""

Cigarettes contain carbon monoxide, tars and nicotine that flood the bloodstream. While those toxins flow through the lungs, the blood becomes the conduit, through which these compounds reach the kidneys, and ultimately, the bladder. These carcinogens are excreted in the urine, says Grossman.

""But urine tends to concentrate things so you have these carcinogens that are taken up in the blood just sitting in the bladder. That''s the mechanism"" which leads to cancer"", according to Grossman.

Patients with advanced disease generally have what is called transitional-cell bladder cancer, which tends to spread. Those with earlier stage disease, often fare well with a treatment involving the tuberculosis vaccine. When overall death rates were considered -- death from any cause, not just bladder cancer -- the results were not as significant, Grossman says.

After follow-up of more than eight years in each group, 90 deaths occurred in the combination therapy compared with 100 deaths in the group treated with surgery, meaning that patients, who received surgery had a 33 per cent greater chance of dying than patients treated with combination therapy, says Grossman.

""These patients are generally older and may die of other causes, but the chance of surviving was higher in the neoadjuvant group,"" he says.

Patients who did best of all, were those, who had no cancer left in the bladder at the time of surgery, the researchers concluded. At the time of surgery, significantly more patients (38 per cent) had no evidence of cancer remaining in bladder tissue, compared to 15 per cent of patients who did not have prior chemotherapy.

""There were significantly more patients in the neoadjuvant group, who had no residual disease compared to the surgery group and those are the patients that have much better survival. The chemotherapy effectively down-staged their cancer,"" says Grossman.

""Ten years after treatment, some of those patients are still alive, so neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery provided a cure for them.""",HOUSTON

15,26 law students expelled for ragging,"PUNE: The ILS Law College, acting on the recommendations of the one-man inquiry committee, has expelled all 26 students accused of ragging from the college with immediate effect.

While all the students unions have welcomed the decision, parents of the 26 students, said the decision will have a cascading effect on the minds of the latter.

These 26 senior students, including seven girls, were earlier expelled by the college management on charges of ragging their juniors, but the order was stayed at the intervention of the Indian Law Society president and former Supreme Court judge YV Chandrachud.

The college also instituted a fresh inquiry by retired Bombay High Court judge Raghavendra Jahagirdar.

According to senior lecturer and college rector HP Deshmukh, while 16 students were expelled from the college for a year, the remaining 10 were debarred from taking admission to the ILS Law college for a period of four years, with effect from next the academic session.

""Both the decisions were taken as per the ordinance 157 of the University of Pune,"" he added.

He said that Justice Jahagirdar submitted his report on September 4 after hearing all sides, including the students who were ragged by their seniors.

Declining to divulge details of the ""confidential"" report, he said the collegeâ€™s principal, Vaijayanti Joshi, issued the expulsion order on Tuesday.

""These 10 students were the ones found indulging in the act of misconduct at the hostel rooms of their juniors on July 18 midnight,"" Deshmukh said, adding that the transfer certificates, to be issued to these 26 students, will clearly reflect the reason for their expulsion.

Amongst those who have also been debarred from taking admission to the ILS Law College, include the son of the high-profiled additional advocate general of Gujarat, Kamal Trivedi.

Deshmukh further said the 26 expelled students, who are already serving a suspension order following the inquiry, has been informed about the decision individually. ""Even those who had hostel accomodation, have been asked to vacate it immediately,"" the rector said.

Joshi, was however, unavailable for comment despite repeated efforts.

While a second-year student of the law college, who did not want to be named, termed the decision as harsh, fifth year student Anupam Tripathi said, ""Itâ€™s okay if they were found guilty of ragging by the inquiry committee.""

Deepak Mukherjea, a guardian of one of the expelled students, however, said the decision will inflict a severe mental blow to all the victims. Kamal Trivedi, despite repeated efforts, refused to entertain any phone calls.

Justice Chandrachud, while intervening in the earlier expulsion order initiated by the college management, had pointed out that there ""procedural lapses in observing the principles of natural justice, and had suggested that the latter should have issued proper show cause notices to each of the 26 students, before taking any decision.

16,People panic as Ganga water level increases,"PATNA: The rising water level of Ganga in the last 24 hours has created panic among people residing in the entire stretch between Digha Ghat to Gandhi Ghat in the city.

People residing in the low-lying areas of Patna, particularly in the western part, remained outside their house throughout the night fearing that water may rush into it. People were busy shifting their cars and motorbikes to safer places. In some of the residential areas people have themselves installed pumps to flush out the gushing water in absence of any arrangement from the local administration.

The anger against the failure of district administration and irrigation department to take preventive measure to meet the flood like situation was also visible among the people. K K Ghai, a resident of western Patna, criticised the district administration for not providing relief measure on time.

The resident of the Ganga Tower in the LCT Ghat area in western Patna are worst-hit because of the knee-deep water that has accumulated in the basement.

Fazal Naqvi, a resident of Ganga Tower, said that the residents of the apartment kept on contacting the fire brigade office since Tuesday evening but in vain. The district magistrate, Deepak Prasad and other government officials reached only late in the night, he said adding ""this was also after some local politicians informed Prasad about the situation"".

The DM who is on vigil since Tuesday night said that the district administration is on alert. Doctors and veterinarians have been asked to be alert round the clock to meet any critical situation, he said.

Prasad said that the irrigation department has been asked to block all the sluice gates by sand bags so that water does not enter the town. The work of blocking the gate is likely to be completed by Wednesday night, he added.

According to Prasad over hundred boats have been deployed to ferry stranded people to safer places. Prasad also assured local people that if condition requires every one will be evacuated to safer place.

17,Sugar industry wants more sops from govt,"PUNE: The state sugar industry has asked for more sops from the Union government to enable them to pay statutory minimum price (SMP) of Rs 730 per tonne of sugarcane suggested by the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for the new crushing season commencing in November.

Industry sources told Times News Network on Monday that CACP had recommended SMP of Rs 730 per tonne of sugarcane for 8.5 per cent recovery rate.

Additional Rs 85 per tonne of sugarcane will have to be paid to farmers for every 1 per cent additional recovery of sugar. Considering that the average recovery rate of sugar factories in Maharashtra was a healthy 11.66 per cent, factories will have to dish out almost Rs 998 per tonne of sugarcane.

Alarmed by the figures, sugar factories want the Union government to give them interest free loan of Rs 200 per tonne for a period of nine years to enable them to pay the SMP.

A decision to raise the demand was taken during a high level meeting held in Mumbai on September 5, which was attended by Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, finance minister Jayant Patil, officials from departments of finance, co-operation, state federation of co-operative sugar factories and NCP leader Sharad Pawar.

Industry sources said that the conversion cost of sugar factories was Rs 550 per tonne. If one added SMP of Rs 818 (after adding harvesting and transportation cost of Rs 180 per tonne to Rs 730) to the conversion cost, the total production cost would work out to Rs 1,368 per tonne.

""Considering the average realisation cost of Rs 1,200 per tonne of sugar, factories would suffer net cash loss of Rs 168 per tonne,"" sources said, adding such high SMP would kill the sugar industry in Maharashtra.

However, the sugar industry is keeping mum about the ''extra income'' they earn thanks to the healthy recovery rate and by-products like bagasse and molasses. According to experts, at 11.66 per cent recovery rate, each tonne of sugarcane produced sugar worth Rs 1,405.

Baggase got another Rs 200 per tonne while molasses earned Rs 40 per tonne. ""This means that sugar factories earn Rs 1,645 from every tonne of sugarcane,"" experts pointed out.

Experts observed that factories should not find it difficult to pay the SMP of Rs 998 per tonne even if one considered the processing cost on higher side at Rs 655 per tonne.

""So unless there is siphoning of money, factories should be able to manage paying SMP,"" they remarked. Interestingly enough, the state committee for agricultural commodity pricing in August recommended SMP of Rs 706.

Meanwhile, the sugar industry''s demand for additional sops would be raised during a high level meeting at Delhi on Tuesday called by Union ministries of food and civil supplies, agriculture and finance.

19,Major changes expected in law ministry,"NEW DELHI: Major changes are expected in the law ministry in the coming weeks. The 16th Law Commission, whose term ended recently, would be reconstituted retaining the old team of Justice K Jagannadha Rao as chairman and NM Ghatate as member.

But commission''s member-secretary TK Viswanathan, considered one of the ablest legal draftsman in the law ministry, is tipped to take over as secretary, legislative department after SC Jain retires next month.

Lobbying is hard to take Viwanathan''s place in the Law Commission. Among the front runner is Durgadas Gupta, joint secretary in the law ministry''s department of justice. Gupta would be retiring within next few months and is considered close to law minister Arun Jaitley. Jain, sources say, is lobbying to become member of the law commission or Election Commission.

""There would be a vacancy in the EC after CEC''s term gets over early next year,"" says a source who insists that Jain does not stand much chance in the law commission since it does not want to increase its member strength from one.

26,MPCC chief to lead protest against NDA govt,"PUNE: Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Ranjit Deshmukh will lead the morcha planned by the Congress Pune District unit at the Pune Collectorate on Friday to protest against the union government''s â€œanti-farmer and anti labourâ€� policies.

Speaking to reporters, District Congress Chief Ram Kandge said that all party workers affiliated to various Congress units -- right from youth Congress to Sevadal, will participate in the massive morcha.

The morcha has been organised as a part of a series of agitation''s which the Congress plans to undertake to expose the A B Vajpayee government''s failure to deal with several crucial issues, mainly its failure to protect the interest of the workers and the farmers, he said.

Kandge said that the Pune has been chosen among the three cities from where these agitation''s will be launched. Similar agitation will also be undertaken in Aurangabad and Nagpur, he added.

President of the district youth Congress Sanjay Ubhe said that after the morcha at the collectorate the party will stage a rail roko agitation at the Talegaon Dabhade railway station on September 22 at 1 pm.

This will be followed by a rasta roko agitation on Pune-Ahmednagar road at Shikrapur on September 30 at 11 am, he added.

Meanwhile, the district congress unit has sent a memorandum to the chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde urging him to declare drought in six talukas in Pune, namely, Purander, Indapur, Baramati, Shirur, Daund and Haveli.

It has also demanded Shinde to issue grants to tackle the drought like situation in the eastern parts of Khed, Ambegaon and Junner, Kandge said.

27,Gram panchayat's help seeked to prevent farmers' suicides,"BANGALORE: Besides appealing to celebrities to counsel farmers, the state government is also planning to rope in gram panchayat members to build the self-confidence of farmers, after a spate of suicides in the state allegedly related to crop loss.

Chief minister S.M. Krishna, in an informal chat with reporters on Tuesday night, said: ""We are seriously thinking of entrusting the confidence- building task to gram panchayat members. They will have acquaintance with all the families in the village and will be aware of the problems they are facing. They could play a vital role in identifying the families with hardship and bail them out of any crisis situation.""

Gram panchayat members could educate farmers on government the programmes and help them get benefits including interest waiver and farm credit.

Krishna, however, said statistics complied by the police indicated clearly that the rate of

suicides were not on a surge in the state. ""As per surveys, the suicide rate in Karnataka has been high from years. From 1996 to 2000, 56,790 persons have committed suicide -- an average of 11,358 per year. In 2001 and 2002, there were 11,881 and 12,270 respectively,'' he added.

Still, Krishna maintained the government was not disputing the distress situation and trauma faced by the farmers over the last three years due to drought. Sharing the experience he had during a visit to his constituency Maddur recently, he said: ""I was stunned to hear the extent of loans -- one farmer, who killed himself, had to repay Rs one lakh! I asked a woman member of his family how they were able to raise such a massive credit in a small village and who were the lenders, but she said they got it from the neighbours.""

Since the farmer owned only about 1.5 acres of land, Krishna said: ""It could be anybody''s guess that a credit of Rs one lakh cannot be managed by a single family in that economic milieu.""

Krishna, however, rued that in some cases, pesticide was poured into the throat of dying people, giving the example of the recent electrocution death in Chennapatna, which was sought to be passed off as a farmers suicide. He also denied that the newly promulgated ordinance on recovery by money lenders had clogged up the credit flow in the villages.

28,Karnataka doing best to infuse confidence in farmers,"BANGALORE: Chief minister S.M. Krishna in a detailed report submitted to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on cases of farmers in Karnataka committing suicide due to suspected crop loss or debts has assured her that his government was taking measures in ""confidence building"" to desist them from taking the extreme step.

The report is in response to discussions which Sonia had with Krishna over the issue during her visit to Bangalore on September 1. The report appended with copies of government order on the farmers package, break-up of statistics on farmers suicides from 1996 onwards, ordinance on prohibition of charging exorbitant interest by money lenders and Krishna''s appeal to farmers was sent to Sonia on Tuesday.

In the report, copy of which is available with The Times of India, Krishna quoting the Veeresh committee''s findings (which inquired into the farmers suicides) said: ``The total number of suicides in the period 1996 to 2000 was 56,790. Of these the reported cases of suicides from farming and agricultural activity were 10,959 or average 20 per cent of the total number of cases reported.''

Accordingly, the suicides figures work out to about 2,200 cases per year or 180 cases each month. ``Against this backdrop, the number of suicides reported during 2003-2004 --208-- does not appear to be significantly high, notwithstanding drought and extreme scarcity conditions,'' the report said.

Besides in the tenure of the present government(2000 onwards), the total number of suicides in Karnataka under all categories was 26,956. ``This must be compared to the figure of 56,790 in the previous four years,'' the report stated.

It said the government has taken several comprehensive and integrated measures to alleviate the situation. A major one being reliefs ranging from interest subsidy to inputs at concessional rates-- amounting to Rs 880 crore.

``As a measure of confidence building the CM issued an appeal to farmers to desists them from taking their own lives and to repose trust in the attempts made by the government to create a harmonious and conducive environment,'' the report said.

In the appeal published in the vernacular press, Krishna said: ``It has been an unanswered question that haunts me why our farmer friend, who gives life through his field will end his life through suicide. We shall have to face the problem with confidence and try to overcome it. Suicide, under any circumstance, is definitely not a solution. Rather it brings nothing but torrent of sufferings and it no doubt drives the family of the bereaved into oblivion.''

Substantiating his appeal, Krishna said: ``I am an ardent believer and I hope that the anger of Mother Nature will dissipate soon. We have also tried to augment the nature''s boom by trying out the latest technology of cloud seeding. My sincere appeal to you my farmer friends is that please do not resort to suicide. With your blessings, the government in these four years has helped you and is committed to find solutions to your woes. Let us lead a life of confidence. Face the tomorrow with strength and faith.''

29,"Vadodara schools heed bandh call, remain closed","VADODARA: A majority of schools here remained closed on Wednesday, in the wake of the bandh call given by Bajrang Dal to protest against the incident of an intruder attempting to allegedly molest schoolgirls in a city school on Monday.

Schools wore a deserted look as even those who came to the schools unaware of the bandh, were sent back. However, principals maintained that the schools were closed owing to security reasons.

As there has been no official instruction in this regard, the office staff and teachers had reported to work. Panic struck on Monday after a man was caught at Kushalchand Kanya Vidyalaya primary school in Dandia bazaar allegedly trying to kidnap schoolgirls.

Although he was a mentally disturbed person, rumour spread here that terrorists had attacked the school.

As a result many other schools cancelled classes. Says principal of Maharani Chimnabai High School Vijay Kulkarni, ""As most schools were aware of the incident, they decided to join the protest. We had to sent back a few students who had turned up in the morning.""

A handful of schools were unaware of the bandh call and worked as usual. They even got fairly good attendance; some had declared a holiday well in advance on Tuesday. Says a student of Convent of Jesus and Mary School, ""We knew about the holiday on Tuesday and we are not attending school today. Our teacher had made an announcement the previous day.""

""We are working as usual as we are unaware of any bandh. has not been announced in newspapers, too. We did get few inquiries from anxious parents, but there is no cause for concern,"" said Priyadarshini Kelkar, principal of New Era School.

Meanwhile, the district education officer stated that there has been no official instruction in this regard.

""We have some reports of Bajrang Dal activists approaching schools seeking support for the bandh. Though most schools have opted to remain closed, few are working as usual. As there is no instruction from Gandhinagar, for all practical purposes, Wednesday is working day,"" say DEO KM Varsat.

Among them is delegation of minority community members, the Bajrang Dal and the VHP.

â€œWe protest against the youth being termed as terrorist. The person was mentally unstable and has been dragged into unnecessary controversy,â€� said a representative of the minority-dominated area Mukhtar Ahmed.

â€œWe have requested the district administration to conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident.â€�

â€œThe police still has not clarified about the presence of two more accomplices with the youth. They came with the intention to kidnap a minor. We seek a detailed enquiry in the case,â€� said VHP city unit president Ajay Joshi.

31,Uncertainty over MSU elections,"VADODARA: The fate of the M S University Students Union (MSUSU) polls scheduled for September 15 hangs in balance as the civil court has issued an interim injunction.

However, student leaders allege that the university authorities are deliberately trying to delay the proceedings. The elections were dogged by another controversy after the court injunction nullified the election notification.

An injunction was in response to a petition that stated that act of dividing the commerce faculty into separate units for the purpose of polls was arbitrary and illegal. It contended that this made the election notification void.

Moreover, a syndicate resolution had stipulated that the polls must be held before September 15. So the leaders are jittery. The election process has a long way to go as the withdrawal is still pending. NSUI district president Prakash Verma said, â€œ Undoubtedly there has been a deliberate delay by the university. It had received the court order on Friday but filed a reply only on Monday evening.â€�

One candidate might have moved the court but several others are canvassing on the campus. â€œOne of the reasons for the delay is that the NSUI has a stranglehold in this polls and the authorities want to see us off. First, they tried to keep our candidates away by an amendment not allowing students who took readmission after failing in another faculty. Then they tried to suspend them. Now, this dilly-dallyingâ€� added Verma.

Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad state joint secretary Bharat Dangar expressed similar views. â€œUniversity authorities should have filed a reply earlier. We do not have any problem as our only candidate for the post of general secretary Vikas Dubey is in a strong position. "" Vice chancellor K C Upadhyay denied the charges of a deliberate delay in filing the reply.

â€œWe acted as soon as we got the orderâ€�, he said. However, he evaded further comment. Meanwhile, the hearing was adjourned to Thursday.

32,"20,000 women arrested for bootlegging","GANDHINAGAR: There is a growing involvement of women in the illicit liquor trade flourishing in the countryâ€™s only dry state â€” Gujarat. The state assembly was informed on Wednesday that the 19,941 women were arrested for bootlegging activities in the financial year 2002-03.

In a written reply to Bhavnaben Chapatwala (BJP), minister of state for prohibition Amit Shah, stated that the prohibition department has registered 33,308 cases for violation of Prohibition Act during the period.

These figures, though startling, has brought out in the open what was well known among enforcement officials. Recently, a 23-year-old college student, Ritu Patel, was arrested by the Ahmedabad police on charges of bootlegging. Seventeen bottles of liquor were recovered from her.

Sources in the state prohibition department said that in cities like Surat and Ahmedabad the involvement of women in liquor trade is widespread. Patel, a science graduate, said she wanted to earn quick money to go abroad. But despite strong pointers towards womenâ€™s involvement in the liquor trade, the prohibition department has just 10 women constables, all of them on deputation.

Officials at the state prohibition department disclosed, â€œwomenâ€™s role in liquor trade has never been investigated because the government does not sanction women officers in the prohibition department.â€�

Recently, at a high-level meeting, it was decided that more women police constables would be inducted in the prohibition department. RMS Brar, commissioner (prohibition) said: â€œWe are trying to get at least two lady police constables on deputation in each of our 69 prohibition stations in Gujarat. For now we rely on the existing police force in each locality to provide us with women police officials whenever required.â€�

But, that may prove to be too little, too late. A senior police official told TNN, â€œThere is need for a special cell targeting women bootleggers. Investigations and routine raids have proved that the status accorded to women in society is grossly misused. That women cannot be given a body check is often the main reason why many of them are used in the tradeâ€�.

However, according to Ilaben Pathak of Ahmedabad Womens Action Group, if number of women arrested in illicit trade is high, it does not imply that women dominate the bootlegging trade.

â€œOften when police conduct raids, the men run away and the women are arrested. The truth is that most often women are pushed into the trade by forceâ€�.

33,CM dismisses possibility of President's rule,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh dismissed the possibility of imposition of President''s rule in Punjab.

Commenting on Union cabinet minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa''s assertion that the Centre may consider imposing President''s rule in Punjab, the chief minister said that only ground for imposing President''s rule was failure of law and order and constitutional machinery.

""There is nothing like this in Punjab and any one can see it,"" he said adding that Dhindsa should restrain himself from making such statements.

Amarinder Singh said that it was ironical that the Akalis who had been demanding abolition of Article 356 related to imposition of President''s rule in the states have emerged as champion of using this provision now when it is out of power. Regarding the dharna of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, Amarinder Singh claimed that 90 per cent of the farmers'' demands have already been met and there was no reason to agitate.

Amarinder Singh outrightly dismissed the farmers'' demand for free electricity. ""I had made it categorically clear that there won''t be any power if it is provided free as the entire power system would crumble,"" he said adding that the farmers themselves had pleaded for assured sufficient power and they would pay for it. But now, again some farmers have raised the populist demand of free power which is not in the state''s interests, added.

However, he conceded to the farmers'' demand for raising of minimum support price (MSP) and its early announcement was just, but within the purview of the Union government. Amarinder Singh advocated that MSP should be linked to price index. While the government has virtually stopped MSP, the prices of agricultural inputs have been rising fast, he argued. He offered to on dharna if the farmers'' outfits decide stage one at New Delhi.

Regarding the payment of sugarcane arrears to the farmers, Amarinder Singh again passed the buck to the Union government saying that the Centre had not lifted sugar worth Rs 700 crore from Punjab nor it permitted the state to dispose it.

34,15 hurt in police-villagers clash,"SRIGANGANAGAR: About 12 villagers and three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were injured in a clash between residents of Kalian village, situated six km from here on Hindumalkot road, and the Sriganganagar police on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday.

Hundreds of residents, on Wednesday, sat on a dharna in front of the office of district police chief in protest against the police action while a circle inspector of the police was placed under suspension and criminal case was registered against two circle inspectors.

The clash took place when a police party led by Kesri Chand Yandu, circle inspector, Sriganganagar sadar, reached Kalian village to arrest Khushal Chand Arora, a shopkeeper, under the allegations of running business of satta in his shop.

As the police tried to arrest Arora, a large number of villagers gathered and protested the shopkeeperâ€™s arrest claiming that he was an upright and religious person. But once one of the policemen allegedly slapped Arora in the presence of villagers, the latter turned violent and chased the police out of the village.

While the policemen reportedly fled, the villagers caught Sua Lal, the driver of the police vehicle, and beat him up badly and damaged the police vehicle.

Soon, heavy police force reached the village under the command of circle officer Ashok Kumar. While the police officer was trying to sort out the dispute, the villagers allegedly started throwing stones and in retaliation the police resorted to lathicharge.

Three policemen, including sub inspector Rani Dhan and 12 villagers, sustained head injuries.

As the tension between the police and villagers further increased, district police incharge U R Sahu and additional district magistrate (city) Ashok Yadav reached the village at about 3 am on Wednesday and tried to pacify the villagers. The latter were, however, adamant on registering of a criminal case against the policemen and demanded that Rajinder Singh, circle officer Sadul Sahar and Kesri Chand Yandu be suspended.

On Wednesday, about 700 residents, including women and children of Kalian village, gathered in front of the district police incharge office and started raising slogans against the police. After 4-5 hours of continuous dharna, the district police conceded to the demand of the villagers.

Sahu ordered the suspension of Kesri Chand Yandu and ordered registration of a criminal case against Rajinder Singh and Yandu. Sahu said that he had deputed S P Midha, DSP, Sriganganagar, for conducting an inquiry into the incident. He admitted that some policemen had committed mistake and assured strict legal against all guilty policemen.

Meanwhile, the three policemen, who sustained head injuries, were admitted at Civil Hospital, Sriganganagar.

36,BJP decides to go it alone in Assembly polls,"BANGALORE: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday ruled out alliance with any political party and stated it would prefer to fight the forthcoming assembly elections in five states on its own.

Briefing reporters after a day-long national office bearers meeting, held outside Delhi for the first time, senior leader Pramod Mahajan said, â€˜â€˜The meeting discussed the partyâ€™s preparedness for elections in Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram, which go to polls in November. We have decided to fight alone.â€™â€™

Asked if the results would be a referendum on Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s government, Mahajan retorted, â€˜â€˜The PMâ€™s standard for examination is different and will be known only in September 2004. In any case, there is little relation between assembly and Lok Sabha elections of late. These elections are the last trial of strength between the two principal political parties in the country and is a referendum for Congress CMs who rule these states. We are confident of winning the four big states and making an entry into Mizoram.â€™â€™

Mahajan said the party had decided not to have alliances in other states for the present. â€˜â€˜In Karnataka too, we will not have any alliance. The party will chart its own course,â€™â€™ he stated.

He said Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani had urged them to draw valuable lessons from the recent no confidence motion which â€˜â€˜boomeranged on the oppositionâ€™â€™, the ASI report on Ayodhya, the Congressâ€™ absurd stand on national and patriotic issues, feel- good factor arising out of a buoyant economy and Indiaâ€™s fight against terrorism.

Commenting on the Ram temple issue, he said, â€˜â€˜The ASI report has only confirmed our belief that a Ram temple existed. It is now time for the Muslim community to show their magnanimity and accept the facts. However, there will be no legislation on the matter in this Lok Sabha, though it is now unnecessary since the facts have proved the templeâ€™s existence.â€™â€™

Mahajan said the present situation in UP would help the party in the long run. â€˜â€˜The party might have lost the government and a partner in the short term, but it will help towards becoming the real opposition. However, the party will attack the Mulayam Singh government wherever it goes wrong,â€™â€™ he stated.

On the agenda at the meet, here, he said, â€˜â€˜The party will chalk out an agitational path in the state. In the last one month, more than 100 farmers have committed suicide. The party will highlight the failures of the Krishna government.â€™â€™

Mahajan said party leaders and workers will undertake the partyâ€™s biggest mass contact programme from September 25, visiting every village across the country.

Party president M Venkaiah Naidu said attacking the Congress and highlighting the NDA governmentâ€™s achievements would be the formula.

He lashed out at the Congress for its â€˜concoction of liesâ€™ against Vajpayee-led NDA government in the recent no-confidence motion. He also told functionaries that they need to constantly highlight the failures of the Congress. â€˜â€˜It is the most negative opposition since Independence. Its negativism was revealed in the failed no-confidence motion. Each of the nine charges levelled against the Vajpayee government was a concoction of lies,â€™â€™ he stated.
