0,"Forget the party, just enjoy sops","LUDHIANA:Though it will be difficult to predict the effect of economic sops announced by the Centre and the state governments in terms of electoral gains in Punjab at this stage, but certainly it is a win-win situation for the beneficiaries.

Interestingly, the beneficiaries are aware of the political compulsions of these parties, so they want to enjoy the sops without letting them have a bearing on their voting choice. Indian voter is maturing with every poll.

The stateâ€™s trade and industry, whose different segments turned out to be major gainers in the matching rounds of poll-related largesse extended by the the Centre and the state government, were least bothered whether the concessions came from the BJP or the Congress.

The reaction of some organisations and prominent individuals aligned with both the parties is interesting. Mohinder Aggarwal, general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, whose political leaning towards the BJP is well-known, minced no words in hailing the state governmentâ€™s decision to remove exim forms, extension of summary and deemed assessment. ""I believe both the parties are mistaken if their leaders think of outdoing each other in terms of offering sops to woo voters. Its meaningless,"" he candidly remarked.

Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), whose alignments with the Parkash Singh Badal-led SAD is an open secret, hailed the sops announced by chief minister Amarinder Singh. CICU president Inderjit Singh Pradhan was instrumental in arranging a meeting with the PM and Badal to help in pleading the government not to go ahead with imposition of Central excise duty on hosiery last year.

Interestingly, the meetings with the Prime Minister and the one that took place at Chandigarh a couple of days ago with Amarinder Singh were attended by the trade and industry representatives from both the parties. A prominent leader of the hosiery industry, aligned with the Congress, expressed views similar to those by Aggarwal.

On the condition of anonymity, he said, ""The anxiety, uncertainty and harassment faced by a large number of workers due to insensitivity of the Centre and the state government in accepting our genuine demands is still fresh in our minds."" He termed the announcements as a ""typical example of competitive populism"".

So much so, there is a lingering doubt about the governmentâ€™s reverting to presops situation in a ""hidden manner"", if the poll results failed to match their expectations. There have been situations when politically-opposed state and Union governments faced allegations of deliberately ignoring their demands.

1,Chain e-mail calls for silent protest on Republic Day,"PUNE: This Republic Day, a section of the ""silent majority"" will seek to express its concern and have its voice heard on the recent vandalism that occurred at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (Bori).

A chain e-mail that is gathering support on the Internet is urging citizens to assemble at Bori at 9 am on January 26 to participate in silent protest.

As a symbolic expression, and as a ""token of our solidarity, symbol of our pain and concern"", each individual will drop a Re 1 coin in earthen jars that will be placed on the Bori premises.

Anan Chabukswar, a concerned citizen who was among those to forward the e-mail to 10 others, told TNN that he would definitely participate in the protest.

Moved by the e-mail and public support, Bori honorary secretary Saroja Bhate said the institute was flooded with solidarity e-mails from all across the globe.

""But this recent gesture has really touched me. All I can say is that we at Bori are extremely overwhelmed by the public support and solidarity,"" Bhate said.

It may be recalled that on January 5, over 100 activists from the Sambhaji Brigade of the Maratha Sewa Sangh ransacked Bori and destroyed thousands of priceless books and research material to protest against objectionable references in scholar James W. Laine''s book, Shivaji: A Hindu King in Islamic India.

Khoday, who is the president of the party, declared the objective of the political outfit: ""Strive to bring together scheduled castes/tribes, backward classes and under-privileged communities under one umbrella for their overall development.""

""All parties, including the Congress, have neglected the backward classes. All these years, political parties destroyed the foundation laid by former chief minister D. Devaraj Urs, who successfully brought the under-privileged to the mainstream society,"" Khoday told reporters.

He alleged that most of the parties followed a hereditary legacy. ""These party members believe in only pleasing their leaders. But USP will never allow such a practice,"" Khoday contended.

Asked whether the party would contest the next general elections, he said a tour of all Assembly and Parliament constituencies in the state would be undertaken shortly.

""Subsequently, a core committee will be set up in the party soon to chalk out a poll strategy,"" Khoday said. The party had approached the Election Commission of India (ECI) seeking a symbol.

""However, the Commission is yet to approve the party symbol. We will pursue it vigorously,"" he stated. Bharati Urs, daughter of Devaraj Urs, and hundreds of party workers were present on the occasion.

5,NDA govt is anti-farmer: Rabri,"HAJIPUR: Making scathing attack on the NDA led government at the Centre, CM Rabri Devi, while addressing a gathering here after laying the foundation stone of a power project, termed it ""antifarmer"" and ""anti-labourer"".

She said that the Centre has totally failed in launching any programme for the welfare of Dalit and poor. She called upon the people to overthrow the ""anti-poor"" NDA government at the Centre. She said that the government is committed to provide power to all by 2012 AD.

7,Ministers get warning note on House rule,"KOLKATA: The Left Front is putting its legislative House in order. In an unusual step, all ministers in the state Cabinet are being instructed to put on their best behaviour when the state Assembly is in session.

The peoplesâ€™ representatives should also be adequately prepared while answering questions put to them in advance.

In a confidential note issued on Friday to all senior members of the Left Front government, parliamentary affairs minister Prabodh Chandra Sinha made no bones about the fact that he had received a lot of complaints from Opposition as well as Left Front legislators.

Several complaints had come in about the aggressive, and often rude, behaviour of a section of ministers and their unwillingness to answer uncomfortable questions.

The letters, signed by Sinha himself, were despatched to ministers on Friday evening.

The letter says: â€œThere have been a number of complaints from legislatures about ministers not answering written questions on time, refusing to answer oral questions in detail and often couching their unwillingness to answer difficult questions behind a veil of aggressiveness bordering on rudeness.â€�

The letters will reach all ministerial chambers by Monday. With the next session of the state Assembly schedule sometime in the last week of February, it is expected that the note will create stir among senior ministers of the cabinet, unused to such â€œfriendly warningsâ€�.

When contacted, leader of Opposition and Trinamul Congress leader Pankaj Banerjee said, â€œWe had complained to Sinha and Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim. Most ministers do not answer questions in detail and are not even present when members raise issues and questions during mention hour.""

""Earlier there was a custom that ministers would listen to problems during mention hour and at least show the courtesy of getting back to the concerned member in an attempt to address the problem. Now even this show of courtesy is missing,â€� he added.

Banerjee expressed satisfaction when told that the note had been issued. â€œAt least this is a beginning. Let us see if things improve in the next session.â€�

The February session, which will definitely be the last one before the Lok Sabha polls, is expected to be stormy one and interestingly enough, most of the opposition ire may be directed at parliamentary affairs minister Prabodh Sinha himself, who heads the excise department â€” under fire for a series of recent policy decisions.

8,Private parties to have special role in new tourism policy,"LUCKNOW: In keeping with the changing times and in a marked deviation from the old, the new tourism policy being drafted for Uttar Pradesh is all set to open up new and vast vistas of private participation in developing tourist destinations. It is also seeking to encourage employment generation in a big way.

The two marked deviations will form the mainstay of the new policy which is being framed after carving out Uttaranchal from Uttar Pradesh. The last policy drawn up was in 1998 when the hill state was still a part of UP. According to tourism minister Naresh Agarwal, the earlier policy had become redundant in the wake of the redefining of the geographical outlines of UP.

Refusing to divulge much about the policy as it was still in the drafting stage and had to get the clearance of the cabinet, Agarwal said the policy would be explicit on the count of employment generation and private participation in a big way. The two factors were the need of the hour and also imperative if Uttar Pradesh had to make a mark on the international tourist map, he added.

For a sector which has been granted the status of an industry but is considerably starved of cash, private participation is perhaps the only answer for developing the infrastructure.

The government intends to adopt a participatory approach coupled with concessions vis a vis private participation. The department''s approach was very clear on the count, according to UP Tourism director-general Neeraj Gupta.

""Ideal tourism requires three basics: good infrastructure, effective marketing and efficient and impressive other services and facilities. If all the three are in place and function in tandem the end result is ideal tourism,"" he averred. The DG maintained that while the state could deal with marketing and the other services and facilities slot, it was in the development of infrastructure that the main hurdles came as it demanded a lot of resources.

Keeping this in mind, the new policy is expected to offer win-win terms to private investors for developing the infrastructure in the five designated circuits chalked out by the directorate. While the government will take on the role of a supporter the task of creating the infrastructure will be left to private parties.

Since tourism is one industry which can safely be bracketed amongst the most labour intensive ones, the new policy is being so drafted that there will be considerable employment generation also.

An unambiguous economic viability, self-sustainability and commercial orientation of the sector will be the new mantras for the new tourism policy 2004.

10,Mulayam's election wishlist,"NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav met Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh on Friday with his pre-election wishlist.

Sources said the UP CM wanted the Centre to change its sugarcane package, converting the one-time loan into a grant and restoring UPâ€™s powers to issue state advisory prices.

He also wanted Pota charges against Raja Bhaiyya, Vaiko and other political detenus to be withdrawn.

With elections in the offing, Mulayam needs all the help he can get to retain his credibility with the voters.

But lest Fridayâ€™s meeting be interpreted as reflective of a growing closeness between the BJP and the SP, both he and Rajnath were at pains to say after the meeting that there was no political understanding between the two parties.

However, Mulayam and Rajnath do share an interest in keeping former CM Kalyan Singh out of the BJP, sources said. For if Kalyan returns to the BJP, it would weaken the alliance that Mulayam leads while diminishing Rajnathâ€™s clout in the BJP.

Indeed, ever since Kalyan greeted the Prime Minister on his birthday, virtually signalling the formerâ€™s return to the BJP, Mulayam has been a worried man.

In fact, BJP sources said that he had registered his protest both with the BJP and NDA convener George Fernandes, amidst speculation that he could give post-poll TDP-like outside support to the NDA.

It is on the basis of this that he is placing his demands before the Centre. Mulayam is also as concerned as the BJP about the possibility of a Congress-BSP alliance in UP.

On Thursday, BJP general-secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi met BSP leader Mayawati on her birthday to tell her that an alliance with the Congress would not help her as the latter could not only not transfer its vote to the BSP, but it would try and recapture the Dalit vote it had lost to the BSP.

On Friday, Mulayam said he would meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi soon to tell her to stay away from the BSP as that party had allied itself with the BJP thrice and had no credibility in secular circles.

Political sources said that CPM leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet calling on Mayawati had unnerved Mulayam, for thus far, the CPM has stoutly expressed its preference for the SP vis-a-vis the BSP.

11,AIADMK may go solo in LS polls,"CHENNAI: Staying silent so long, while a consolidated opposition brews, the AIADMK finally on Friday indicated that it wanted to win maximum number of seats in Tamil Nadu and therefore may contest the coming Lok Sabha polls alone.

In a six page Tamil statement to the cadres, on the eve of the 87th birth anniversary of the party founder late M G Ramachandran, the party general secretary and state chief minister J Jayalalithaa said: â€˜â€˜You have to work united. Let there be no differences, so that we are able to send all the 40 MPs (Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry) to the Lok Sabha from our party.â€™â€™

Perhaps in pursuit of her goal to bring about a new front, devoid of either the Congress or the BJP, she stressed that it was necessary to get a total victory as a united voice needs to be raised in the Parliament to realise the rights of the state.

â€˜â€˜Our aim in the coming election should be to achieve total victory,â€™â€™ Jayalalithaa said in her statement titled Ore iyakkam, ore kudumbam, ore kural (one movement, one family, one voice).

Again, for the first time, since the DMK, MDMK and PMK broke away from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Jayalalithaa took a dig at her rival, namely the DMK saying that while the ministers representing other states worked for the welfare of their respective states, those from Tamil Nadu did precious little.

With an obvious hint at the former Union forest and environment minister T R Baalu, Jayalalithaa said that the state ministers were more keen on installing impediments on the path of development projects of the state government.

She said the ministers were blinded by the taste of power and had forgotten that they had to face the masses soon. They were going by their leaderâ€™s (M Karunanidhi) principle â€˜â€˜extract as much as possible and then discard,â€™â€™ she said.

12,Forest minister's kin held as a militant sympathizer,"JALPAIGURI: West Bengal forest minister Jogesh Barman''s brother-in-law Shyamal Roy was a member of Azad Hind Bahini, a newly formed obscure organization allegedly aided by the Kamtapur Liberation Organization, Jalpaiguri police superintendent S N Gupta said on Saturday.

Roy was arrested on Friday after interrogation of arrested KLO leader Tom Adhikaryâ€™s interrogation revealed that rocket propelled grenades belonging to the KLO had been hidden in Royâ€™s house and they had been removed from there a week before the Royal Bhutan Army launched an operation against militants in Bhutan on December 15.

Tom was held in Bhutan by the RBA in course of the operation. He had also been involved in an abortive attempt to kidnap a businessman based in Falakata.

Speaking from Jalpaiguri over the phone, the minister said he had nothing to do with his brother-in-law. â€œThe law will take its own course. I did not have contact with my brother-in-law for a long time,â€� Barman said. According to him, the Azad Hind Bahini was a small organization with a confused aim, backed by a Kolkata-based â€˜brahmachariâ€™. â€œThis organization had been responsible in the past for attacks against CPM workers.â€�

Following interrogations of KLO activists in Bhutan, eight more youths were arrested by the Jalpaiguri police on Saturday on charge of being KLO sympathisers, the police said. Among them was Anil Barman, regional co-ordinator of Azad Hind Bahini.

Meanwhile, nine Bangladeshi nationals arrested in the district had allegedly crossed the border illegally with a plan to carry out attacks on vital installations in north Bengal like the Tista bridge during the republic day, police source added.

13,Forest minister files defamation against Achutanandan,"KOCHI: Kerala forest minister K Sudhakaran on Saturday filed a defamation suit against Opposition leader in the state assembly, V S Achutanandan, for alleging that he had received Rs five crore as bribe in a forest wood auction.

The case has been posted for February 21.

Later, talking to reporters, Sudhakaran who appeared in the court, denied the allegations, saying there had been no illegality in the auctioning of the logs and the government exchequer had not sufferred any loss on that account.

14,Non-political trade unions bring hope: Akhi,"KOTTAYAM: National secretary of Akhila Bharatheeya Construction Mazdoor Mahasangh Om Prakash Akhi on Saturday warned that signing agreements under WTO and General Agreement on Trade and Tarif was detrimental to the country.

Speaking at a meet the press programme, prior to the second national conference of BMS affiliated Mahasangh here, Akhi said it was better if the country could think about forming a parallel WTO. In 2001 ""we agitated against WTO,"" he added.

Akhi said non-political trade unions like BMS bring hope to workers. All trade unions in one way or other were affiliated to political parties. It will take some more time for workers to understand the real trade union fighting for protecting the rights of the workers.

Most of the construction workers were in the unorganised sector and they were not having a regular job. Finally the Central Government had passed the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions Of Service) Act in 1996 and except Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, other states had not yet implemented it.
