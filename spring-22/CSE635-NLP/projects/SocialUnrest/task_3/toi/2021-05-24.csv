3,BJP flays induction of tainted ministers,"PATNA: Criticising Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for appointing four ''tainted'' RJD ministers in his team, including the multi-crore fodder scam accused, Laloo Prasad Yadav, the BJP in Bihar on Sunday said that it would launch an agitation across the state to make people aware of the ''dark'' background of the ministers.

Party workers would hold sit-in demonstrations and protest-marches in every district to protest against the inclusion of Laloo Yadav and three of his party colleagues, chargesheeted in separate criminal cases, in the Union cabinet, state party president Gopal Narayan Singh said.

While RJD president Laloo Yadav is chargesheeted by CBI in the fodder scam, Md Taslimuddin is an accused in over a dozen criminal cases, including alleged rape of a minor.

Taslimuddin was removed within a week as minister of state for Home from the United Front government headed by H D Devegowda for his criminal background.

Among two others, Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav had to resign as education minister in the Rabri Devi cabinet in 2002 following his implication in the scam involving awarding of fake B.Ed degrees by some colleges of the Lalit Narayan Mithila university. He was jailed in the case.

The MP from Darbhanga, M A Fatimi, was accused of giving shelter to an aide of underworld don, Dawood Ibrahim.

Singh said that his party would make people aware of the ''dark'' background of Laloo Yadav and others and expose the Congress claim of giving a ''clean'' ministry.

8,Kalyan hints at strenthening party base in Delhi,"LUCKNOW: After party''s debacle in Uttar Pradesh under him, the former chief minister and senior BJP leader Kalyan Singh hinted to play political innings in Delhi. He gave this indication after quitting UP Assembly seat from Atrauli to retain Bulandshahr parliamentary constituency from where he was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time.

He submitted his resignation to the acting speaker UP Assembly Waqar Ahmed Shah on Monday afternoon. ""His resignation has been accepted,"" stated the acting speaker.

Talking to mediapersons after quitting UP Assembly membersip, Kalyan said that he has been asked by the BJP central leadership to come to Delhi and help the party strengthen its organisation and support base. Although Kalyan claimed that he would follow directions of the party high command but he was yet to finally make up his mind to join the party organisation in Delhi.

If he decides to go to Delhi, it would be first time in Kalyan''s political career that the senior BJP leader would be playing political innings outside Uttar Pradesh. He was once given this offer way back in 1996 when he he had vehemently opposed an alliance with the BSP again to form a coalition government after hung Assembly.

But this did not mean that Kalyan would leave Uttar Pradesh from where he began his political career way back in early 60s. ""I would not leave Uttar Pradesh and continue to serve the party and people if I went to Delhi,"" he asserted.

Kalyan had won the Atrauli Assembly seat in Aligarh a record number of ten times. He had lost the seat only twice in 1962 and 1980 when a pro-Congress wave was blowing in favour of Indira Gandhi after failure of the Janata Party regime.

Taking a fresh dig at Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin, Kalyan said that comparing Sonia with Mahatma Gandhi was a ''cruel joke''. Demanding a CBI probe into her foreign origin, Kalyan said that her so-called sacrifice was nothing but a garb to run the UPA government by proxy. ""Congressmen have shown great disrespect to Father of the Nation by comparing Sonia with Mahatma Gandhi,"" he quipped.

On party debacle, Kalyan said that he was personally review results in all Lok Sabha constituencies to ascertain reasons for party dismal performance. ""I would be visiting all Lok Sabha constituencies to review results. Corrective measures would be taken after the exercise is over,"" he said, refusing to make any comment on the possible changes in the state unit in view of debacle.

9,'Criminal' ministers RJD's choice: Cong,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Monday sought to distance itself from the induction of chargesheeted persons, including RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, in the Union Cabinet, saying these decisions were taken by concerned allies.

""It was decided by the respective leaders of allies,"" party spokesman Anand Sharma told reporters when asked why chargesheeted persons like Yadav and his party colleague Taslimuddin and JMM chief Sibu Soren had been inducted into the ministry in spite of the fact that the Congress had been opposing presence of chargesheeted ministers in the previous NDA Government.

""It is a coalition Government and they are our pre-poll allies. Decisions are taken by the respective leaders jointly. They were given mandate by the people,"" he said.

""I cannot go beyond it,"" he said when further pressed on the issue.

Defending Taslimuddin''s and his induction into the Cabinet, Yadav, who took over as the Railway Minister, told reporters that mere chargsheeting of a person did not mean that he or she had been convicted and cited the example of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and BJP leaders L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi.

Taslimuddin said some cases related to agitation were pending against him which had nothing to do with his becoming a Minister.

Commenting on the formation of the UPA Government, BJP said some persons who had been chargesheeted or had criminal cases pending against them had been inducted into the Union Cabinet.

Party spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said ""some of the Ministers in the Union Cabinet are facing charges in various cases.""

He was also critical of induction of Shivraj Patil and P M Sayeed, who had lost the recent Lok Sabha polls, in the Cabinet.
