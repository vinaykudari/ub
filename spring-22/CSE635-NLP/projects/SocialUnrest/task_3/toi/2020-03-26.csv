0,Oppn criticises govt for poor revenue collections,"NEW DELHI: The budget proposals announced by the Delhi state government came in for sharp criticism on Wednesday as the opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly lambasted the governmentâ€™s poor revenue collection.

Opposition leader Jagdish Mukhi said: â€˜â€˜The performance of the government in tax collection has been dismal. Targets set for sales tax, excise tax, entertainment tax, luxury tax and transport tax have not been met.â€™â€™

As a result, the budget size for 2003-2004 has reduced as compared to the outgoing financial year. Mukhi said: â€˜â€˜In 2002-2003, the total budget revised estimate was Rs 10,464 crore. But due to poor revenue collection, the budget size for 2003-2004 has come down to Rs 9,800 crore.â€™â€™

Mukhi said in the 10th five year plan, the percentage of increase in the plan size had been much less than the previous plan. â€˜â€˜The ninth plan recorded an increase of 250 per cent over the eight plan. But the tenth plan has managed to grow only by about 50 per cent over the ninth plan,â€™â€™ Mukhi said. He said the plan fund for 2003-2004 was seven per cent more than 2002-2003.

Mukhi said expenditure is also not up to the mark. Similarly, most of the amount allocated for roads, slums and water supply augmentation, was left unspent in 2002-2003. The opposition came down heavily on the proposal to include kattha and supari in the list of medicinal herbs in kirana items thus reduce the sales tax from eight to four per cent.

VHP state general secretary Dilip Trivedi said students appearing for examinations would be exempted from the bandh. Vehicles would be allowed to ply as well. City Congress unit president Rajkumar Gupta demanded that the state government resign and take moral responsibility for the worsening law and order situation in the state. Home department officials said a red alert had been sounded across the state and vigil would be maintained during Thursday's bandh. Security double standards? Ahmedabad: Questions are being raised about how a former home minister could be left totally unguarded by the state government and whether the withdrawal of guards had something to do with the differences that had cropped up between Chief Minister Modi and Haren Pandya. Family members of Pandya were seen blaming Modi for withdrawing his security. In fact, while Pandya's father and sister gave Modi a piece of their mind, his wife Jagruti also vented her anger at state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana. It is significant that another former home minister, Gordhan Zadaphia, has been provided police protection comprising three personnel. The city police have even set up an SRP picket at Zadaphia's Bapunagar residence. Surprisingly, home secretary K Nityanandam said, After he (Pandya) did not remain a minister, there were no indications to suggest what he would be a target of terrorist attack. Apparently, the same yardstick was not used in Zadaphia's case. Speaker expels Opposition Gandhinagar: Congress members were on Wednesday expelled from the assembly session for creating unruly scenes after Speaker Mangaldas Patel rejected Amarsinh Chaudhary's demand for a statement from Chief Minister Modi. It seems to me that it is a political murder. This is the general perception of the people. If this is true, the government has no right to continue ruling the state. It should resign, Chaudhary said. Undeterred, the Speaker insisted work would continue. The seven Bills, tabled in the assembly, would have to be passed. This prompted Congress MLAs to raise slogans. The Bills were passed without discussion, even as unruly scenes intensified. The slogans, some audible, described the CM as a murderer.

5,'TD govt violated GO 610 norms',"HYDERABAD: Proceedings were stalled for 40 minutes in the Assembly on Wednesday as ruling party and opposition members engaged in heated argument over the implementation of the interim report of the House Committee on GO 610, which looked into anomalous government recruitments in the stateâ€™s three regions.

Earlier, speaker K Pratibha Bharathi disallowed adjournment motions sought to be moved by the Congress and the CPM on the implementation of interim report. However, opposition members persisted that the government make a statement on the issue.

Legislative affairs minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the government had to study the report before it could submit an action taken report (ATR) to the speaker. Leader of the opposition Y S Rajasekhara Reddy wanted the government to commit itself to a time frame for presenting an ATR.

Reddy pointed out that home minister T Devender Goud had assured the House that any anomalies named in the interim report would be rectified. The home minister replied that he stood by his words and promised to correct â€œpast mistakes committed by the Congressâ€� regarding government jobs in Telangana. Goud alleged that the Congress was rousing separatist sentiments by dividing itself into Telangana, Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra units.

Congress members took strong exception to this remark and accused the TDP of taking the GO 610 report â€œcasually.â€� Rajasekhara Reddy pointed out that most of the violations of the GO had taken place during the last 20 years, for 15 of which the TDP was in power. Goud said the government was ready to debate the Telangana issue in terms of its backwardness, the funds allocated for its development by the TDP governments and the relative performance of the two parties towards the development of Telangana. BJP, CPM and MIM members also wanted the government to initiate a discussion on the issue.

Debating members were pacified only after the speaker called a meeting of floor leaders of all parties during the tea break.

The floor leadersâ€™ meeting later decided that an all-party meeting be held on Friday to decide implementation of the interim report of the House Committee.

7,Former BJP govt hunted down political opponents: Virbhadra,"SHIMLA: Himachal chief minister Virbhadra Singh accused the previous BJP government in Himachal of giving a go-by to the healthy political traditions of this hill state and using official machinery and power to crush their political opponents, finish their identity and somehow remove them from the stateâ€™s polity.

Winding up the discussion on the motion of thanks to the governorâ€™s address in the Himachal assembly here on Thursday, he said that it was tragic but political opponents were taken to be enemies by the previous BJP government and its wish became law.

He said that there were many examples of this which could be cited, and if the record of the previous government was followed in the future, it will cause great harm to the state. â€˜â€˜The people of the state have had to hang their heads in shame for such acts of the previous governmentâ€™â€™, he added.

Virbhadra said that his government had got a mandate to remove corruption and its focus would be on corruption. â€˜â€˜But we believe in the rule of law and not rule of the jungle and as such investigating agencies in the state had been directed that no individual would be humiliated or harassed and no false documents or cases will be made, even as the corrupt will not be spared, regardless of their positionâ€™â€™, he added.

He said that the financial position of the state was in a bad shape and there was not enough tax base or resources to make up the losses. Steps would have to be taken to remove the debt burden and increase the revenue, but it would not be at the cost of the poor and the rich and well-off would have to make some sacrifices, he added.

Urging all to cooperate in solving the gigantic problem being faced by the state he, however, said that it was rather sad that the BJP did not support the resolution moved by him on Wednesday referring to the increase of salaries and perks of judicial officers to the centre.

â€˜â€˜We passed the resolution as there was no way out. The matter was pending before the previous government for the last one-and-a-half years, but it did not take any decision. We had to take the decision, though we have the highest regard for the judiciaryâ€™â€™, he added. The chief minister said that it was under the active consideration of the government to increase the salaries of the judges and judicial officers, as it is a state subject. A bill would be passed which would meet the expectations of the judicial officers; it will be a middle path taken after due consultation with them, he added.

He assured the House that the government would take a decision in the next ten to fifteen days on the user charges that had been imposed by the previous government in hospitals of the state. â€˜â€˜However, let me make it clear that there have been allegations that the user charges were first imposed by a Congress government in 1974. This is mere fallacyâ€™â€™, he added.

Virbhadra said that the issue of the creation of a Himalayan regiment had been raised time and again by the previous government, but despite their being a BJP-led government in Delhi, the Centre had turned down the demand. â€˜â€˜However, I will take it up with the Centre as it is in the interest of the stateâ€™â€™, he added.

8,Graft charges against former BJP-HVC ministers to be probed: CM,"SHIMLA: Himachal chief minister Virbhadra Singh said that the government had decided to probe all the charges that the Congress had made in its chargesheet against certain ministers in the previous BJP-HVC combine government in the state, which was given to the governor in August 2000 to be forwarded to the CBI.

Winding up the discussion on the motion of thanks to the governorâ€™s address in the Himachal assembly here on Thursday, he said that even those allegations that had been levelled by some BJP ministers and party MLAs against some ministers in their own government in alliance with the HVC would also be inquired into.

â€˜â€˜The charges levelled were placed on the floor of the House and as such are the property of this House. We will also take cognisance of all those charges that were made, as they were not taken back by the concerned ministers, and also conduct an inquiry into themâ€™â€™, he added.

The chief minister said that huge hoardings were put up by the previous government announcing the developmental works done during its tenure, but the payment for these hoardings was done neither by the company hired by the government for its PR nor the government itself.

â€˜â€˜Some company paid the amount of money to the private secretary of the chief minister, who is a state government officer, and the private secretary deposited that money in his personal account, and later paid the amount by his personal cheque. It is a grave impropriety and the entire transaction is being inquired into for which the guilty will have to bear the consequencesâ€™â€™, he added.

He said that it was a shame that the money that had been collected as user charges in the IGMC hospital here from the poor who had gone for treatment, was not used for medicines or other facilities for the poor, but for purchase of new vehicles for the health minister, health director, college principal and for expenses incurred while holding the convocation of Igmc here.

â€˜â€˜These are allegations that I have heard and have not got probed, but they will be definitely looked after and if they are true, then quite a few heads will roll. For the hard-earned money of the poor, by selling chunks of their land for medical treatment, cannot be squandered in such a mannerâ€™â€™, he added.

9,"Urge CBI to expedite probe, BJP tells govt","AHMEDABAD: A meeting of the office-bearers of the state unit of Bharatiya Janata Party voiced serious concern over the killing of ex-home minister and BJP leader Haren Pandya and urged the state government to take prompt action to nab the culprits involved in the dastardly attack.

The meeting, presided over by state unit chief Rajendrasinh Rana, felt that the modus operandi of Pandyaâ€™s assassination and an attempt on life of VHP leader Dr Jaideepbhai Patel was similar. In these circumstances, the government should urge the CBI to expedite its inquiry into the attack, they felt.

In a condolence resolution passed at the meeting, senior BJP leaders hailed the services rendered by Pandya not only to the party organisation but also in his capacity as home and revenue ministers, in the past six years.

Rana described the departed leader as a dedicated and committed BJP worker who sacrificed himself while upholding the high ideals and moral values in public life. The meeting was attended among others by Jayantilal Barot, Suresh Gandhi and Nalin Bhatt.
