1,Minister firm on forest laws,"Patna: Bihar forest and environment minister Jagadanand Singh refused to relax the forest laws for the benefit of stone crushers and saw mill owners, saying that it would lead to further erosion of the natural resources of Bihar. He told forest department officials to enforce the laws strictly.

Replying to a three-hour debate on the Rs 38-crore budgetary demand of his department in which several MLAs, cutting across party lines, pointed out that many stone crushers and saw mills had closed down due to forest departmentâ€™s crackdown, the minister said Rohtas DFO Sanjay Singh sacrificed his life fighting against the timber and mining mafia. Later, the budgetary demand was passed by the assembly on voice vote.

The minister pointed out the forest cover of bifurcated Bihar, which stands at 6.87 per cent, is still higher than many agriculture-based states like Haryana and Punjab. â€œBut we have to increase the forest coverage to 20 per cent in the next five years,â€� he said. He refuted the charge that forest department was creating problems for people who cut their own trees.

2,Principals face tough time turning down applications,"MUMBAI: When city students came up with the best score-card ever in the Std X examinations this year, college principals werenâ€™t exactly celebrating. They knew what was in store for them: longer queues of students seeking admission to science and commerce courses, more letters from politicians recommending candidates, even more applications to turn down.

The nightmare is now being played out in many junior colleges across the city, where the number of applications are easily twice or thrice more than the seats available. â€œWe are just snowed under applications,â€™â€™ says M.G. Shirahatti, principal of Lala Lajpat Rai college, Haji Ali. It is the case every year, but the high marks that a majority of students have scored this time around have made turning them down that much more difficult.

â€œWhen their child gets 70 per cent or above, parents think itâ€™s a very good score. They are not able to understand that in most colleges the cut-off marks are over 80 per cent,â€™â€™ says Fr Joe Dias, principal of St.

Xavierâ€™s College, Dhobi Talao. Academicians are still working out the reasons behind the marks-miracle â€”Mumbai division scored an unheard of 79.25 per cent in the Secondary School Certificate examâ€”but the after-effects have left them reeling.

St. Xavierâ€™s, which got 2,800-odd applications for 330 arts seats, had to stop admitting students at 82 per cent in arts.

At Vaze college, Mulund, the cutoff per cent was 88.6 per cent in science. Last year, the collegeâ€™s cut-off percentage was 87.2.

With over one-and-a-half-lakh students seeking admission to junior colleges this year, principals are having a tough time juggling numbers.

â€œAnd the government hasnâ€™t done anything to help,â€™â€™ says a college principal. â€œIt has clearly said that there wonâ€™t be any grant for new colleges or divisions, so no one is interested in starting arts or commerce courses.â€™â€™ So far, the government strategy has been to push more students into already-crowded classes.

Currently, classes have 120-odd students, a number that teachers find difficult to manage. â€œNow, colleges donâ€™t even have the space to accommodate a higher number of students,â€™â€™ says M.R. Kurup, principal of Vaze college.

The no-win situation has raised questions about the future of students who couldnâ€™t score the magic percentage required from them.

Principals, meanwhile, point out that the admission problem itself is largely due to the fact that students seek seats only in certain colleges. â€œThere is this hype surrounding certain colleges and students feel that they have to pass only out of these institutes,â€™â€™ says Fr Dias. Never mind the fact that many end up spending more time in coaching classes than on campus, students try to secure seats only in institutions which have a certain status, he adds.

In fact, last year, there were vacant seats in many lesser-known junior colleges, even as principals in more famous institutions worked out ways to avoid calls from politicians and similar pressure tactics. Aspi Doctor, principal of Tolani college, Andheri, explains that students opt for institutions which have degree colleges attached, as they automatically secure admissions after their Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinations.

â€œIf they join a junior college attached to a school, they will end having to go through the whole admission rigmarole after HSC,â€™â€™ adds.

If there is to be some improvement, principals say that there is dire need to introduce new courses, so that students have options other than the plain-old arts, science commerce courses. â€œEveryone wants to be a doctor or an engineer, and that isnâ€™t possible. Students should be told that they can go in for vocational courses, instead of making a beeline for science,â€™â€™ says Mr Shirahatti.

He points out that the state should also have a perspective plan place, giving details of the number colleges to be set up to meet the increasing student requirements. Planning is one aspect that has been totally ignored in the absence of government participation, specially far as funding is concerned, principals say.

Activist threatened for opposing illegal slums â€˜The state should also have a perspective plan in place, giving details of the number of colleges to be set up to meet the increasing requirements. Planning is one aspect that has been totally ignored in the absence of government participation, specially as far as funding is concerned.

3,Gadkari flays government on scanty aid to flood-hit,"BHIWANDI: The Vilasrao Deshmukh government which hurriedly sanctioned schemes worth thousands of crores of rupees to win the support of a few MLAs during the recent no-confidence motion was rubbing salt on the wound of Thaneâ€™s flood victims by paying them a mere Rs 1 crore, leader of opposition in the legislative council Nitin Gadkari said here on Thursday.

Speaking to reporters during his visit to the rain-hit areas, Mr Gadkari said the Deshmukh government had sanctioned developmental schemes worth Rs 10,000 crore in the constituencies of 143 MLAs who supported it during the recent political crisis.

Without naming independent MLA Hitendra Thakur, the senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader said the government had okayed a Rs 279-crore water supply project in his area in order to secure his vote during the confidence motion.

The same government is giving just Rs 600, a relief aid fixed 21 years ago, to those whose houses have been washed away by the floods. The government is not just being indifferent, it is insulting the victims. The opposition will move an adjournment motion in the legislature when the monsoon session opens on July 29 and ask for a discussion on the flood situation in the state, he said.

The state has asked the Centre for an assistance of Rs 75 crore. â€œWe demand that the state should also contribute an equal amount and pay Rs 2 lakhs to the next kin of the dead instead of the Rs 50,000 that it has now declared,â€™â€™ he said.

According to official figures, 56 people died when the heavy rains lashed the area on June 26. The government claims it has disbursed over Rs 66 lakhs to the flood victims in the district. In Bhiwandi, the government claims it paid Rs 3.5 lakhs to seven of the 13 who died. Three victims remain unidentified and three others were from other parts of the state.

Mr Gadkari, who met with an accident some time ago walked on his aluminium crutches, met several rain-hit families. However,wherever he went, he was greeted by disgruntled people who said the relief had not reached them. Dharmanna Nadgiri, 60, a retired watchman of the municipal drainage pumping station,who lost his elder son, Raju, to the floods said no help had reached him.

Despite his protest, Dharmanna, Rajuâ€™s widow and her four children fell at Mr Gadkariâ€™s feet and cried asking for some monetary aid. â€œGive me a letter asking for a job for your second son. I will try for that,â€™â€™ Mr Gadkari told Dharmanna whose house at the pumping station at Brahman Alley was completely under water on June 26, when the area witnessed three times the average rainfall and the highest in the last several decades.

Ramala Rajput, 45, a member of the nomadic tribes who hawked plasticware on Bhiwandiâ€™s streets too had the same grouse. â€œOur goods worth Rs 3,000 were washed away. The leaders came but no help has poured in,â€™â€™ she said.

Several kilometres ahead, in Ambhai village near Wada, Namdeo Gaikar, another tribal, kept talking to himself. All his rice crops in one acre and eight gunthas of land had been washed away. â€œWhere do I go? What will my children and wife eat? I have nothing to offer them,â€™â€™ he wept, his hands clasping a copy of a government paper which certified him as the owner of the said land. Janardhan Patil of Ambhai said the village had lost over 300 acres of rice crops. Gaikarâ€™s land is now filled with stones and sand brought in by the floods. There cannot be any fresh cultivation here unless this stones and sand are removed. â€œThe government is merely paying the farmers according to the price of what they had sowed. But what about the crop which they have lost?â€™â€™ asked Chitaman Wanaga, MP from Dahanu, another worst-affected area.

Meanwhile, a central team of officials will visit the area on Friday, it is learnt. The chief minister had asked the Centre to send its own team to assess the damage. Workers repair a road at Ashagad near Charoti Naka after the soil was washed away in the recent rains.

4,Traders divided over bandh call,"LUCKNOW: Traders in the state capital are a divided lot over the issue of extending support to the proposed Lucknow Bandh on July 9.

The reason: a rift between the two major associations. While traders associated with the UP Udyog Vyapar Mandal (UPUVP) support the call for the strike and are ready for it, the UP Yuva Udyog Mandal says it has called off the bandh after a meeting with Minister of Institutional Finance and Trade Tax, Lalji Tandon where all the issues were resolved.

However, president of the the Yuva Udyog Vyapar Mandal Sandeep Bansal said that â€œthe bandh call has no meaning as the 11-point charter of demands has been accepted by the authorities and adequate decisions taken.â€� The meeting was held at the residence Lalji Tandon in the presence of Principal Secretary, Tax and registrar, Lalit Srivastava, he said.

He also claimed that the minister â€œhad directed the authorities not to lodge any FIR against goods coming into the capital without registration with immediate effectâ€�. However, Ghanshyam Das Aggarwal, president, LTA, rubbished the claims and reiterated the demand to go on a bandh. Though both organisations are demanding the same concessions, a consensus is presently lacking.

5,State govt pledges action against dental college,"Patna: The state government has pledged to initiate steps against the management of B R Ambedkar Dental College. â€œTwo members â€” T K Rai and Pankaj Choudhary â€” were arrested on Wednesday and a Bolero jeep was seized during police raids. We will arrest the others, including college chairman R N Rai, soon. The police have already sought permission from the court to impound the property of R N Rai,â€� said medical education minister Shakeel Ahmad on Thursday while issuing a statement on the situation in the college. He said that the police force had already been deployed in front of the girlsâ€™ hostel of the college.

The state governmentâ€™s statement on the dental college was marked in two parts â€” Shakeel Ahmad was to speak on the legal status of the college while the law and order part was to be dealt by Panchayati Raj minister Upendra Prasad Verma. However, registration minister V S Dubey objected to the arrangement and pointed out that under the principle of collective responsibility the entire statement could be delivered by one minister. Speaker Sadanand Singh agreed with him and Ahmad was asked to read the entire statement.

Ahmad stated that B R Ambedkar Dental College claimed to be a minority autonomous institution and had been running since 1992. Though the state government had not granted recognition or issued any no-objection certificate to the college, the Dental Council of India had recognised the college for 40 seats and Magadh University granted it affiliation. The vigilance was already conducting a probe into all dental colleges in the state, the minister added.

Ahmad said that the students of the college met him and handed him a list of 30 charges against the college management out of which 12 were pronounced. They included not issuing certificates to the students during the last 12 years, illegally demanding money for internship, tampering with the tabulation sheet to alter results, giving no receipts for the money taken, charging four times the normal fees and demanding upto Rs 13,000 for supplementary examinations and other charges.

The minister said that though the college claimed a minority status, no reservation for the minorities was provided and the land of the college was in the name of chairman R N Rai. The minister stated that Rai was of â€œcriminal natureâ€� and frequently threatened students at gun-point. Ahmad said a committee had been constituted which would submit a detailed report within 15 days. He also said that his department would approach the Dental Council of India, Medical Council of India and Pharmaceutical Council of India to seek their opinions about the role of the state government in such conditions.

6,Andhra govt blames Centre for loans,"Hyderabad: Stung by the Planning Commissionâ€™s criticism that 59 per cent of the stateâ€™s annual plan was being financed through borrowings with the state contributing nothing itself, the state government on Thursday clarified that the high borrowings were necessitated because of the high subsidies it has to bear on various welfare schemes in the housing, power and employment sectors.

Talking to reporters, finance minister Y Ramakrishnudu claimed that the stateâ€™s performance indicators clearly showed that the fiscal discipline measures introduced by the government â€” such as zero-based budget â€” had started showing results. The state would be in a more comfortable position by 2006 when borrowings would come down to Rs 4,000 crore.

The minister said the government was in fact contemplating fresh borrowing to service its loans. These new loans would cast a lesser burden, however, as the interest rates have now gone down. The union government was working out a special package for this, he said.

Ramakrishnudu also said the government had to borrow heavily because devolotion of funds from the union government had been poor. In fact the Centre had advised the states to go in for external loans to bridge their resource gaps. He said chief minister Chandrababu Naidu had suggested to the Centre that instead of rendering such advice, it might find ways of devolving more funds on the states.

The finance minister said Naidu had also urged the Centre to amend the service tax laws and permit the states to retain the revenues collected by them. Presently, the amount collected by way of service tax was going to the central pool and the states got only a small percentage.

Naidu had further suggested that the Centre should not insist on states picking up 30 per cent of the cost of centrally administered schemes. He recommended that instead of the Centre announcing welfare schemes, it should give funds to the state governments who would tailor them to the needs of their people, Ramaklrishnudu added. The minister also said the government had improved its economic performance in recent months. It had ended the first quarter of the fiscal year without taking recourse to an overdraft. This was a clear indication that the government had brought in fiscal discipline.

He said the current fiscal year had started with a balance of Rs 331 crore as against a deficit of Rs 271 crore last year. He said if the central government yielded to the recommendations of the chief minister, the financial condition of the state would further improve.

He said all the states put together were spending about Rs 3.5 lakh crore on centrally sponsored schemes to which the centreâ€™s own contribution was just Rs 1.5 lakh crore. He said the state governments had in the past demanded that devolution be increased from 29 per cent at present to 50 per cent. The Planning Commission had agreed to give 33 per cent but that promise has not yet been fulfilled, he said.

Refuting charges that the state was pulled up for high borrowings, he said, the Commission had approved the Tenth Plan of Rs 46,614, which was Rs 1 crore more than the state projection.

7,DCA seeks report on Tata investment,"NEW DELHI: Department of Company Affairs has sought a report from Tata group on the controversial decision to invest Rs 1,200 crore in its loss making Tata Teleservices from VSNL''s reserves.

Official sources said that the move came following a complaint registered by the Investors Grievances Forum on the alleged ""siphoning off"" of funds by Tata group, which had bought 25 per cent stake of VSNL with management control for Rs 1,429 crore.

It is understood that the department had called for the report at least two weeks ago from Videsh Sanchar Nigam. The department would be able to firm up a view on the compliant only after getting the report from VSNL, the sources said.

Sources, however, said that there would not be any hasty action by the department and it was still examining the merit of the complaint made by IGF as it did not want to rake up fresh controversies.

They said that the department had always taken proactive steps for expediting disinvestment through which the government had targetted Rs 12,000 crore this fiscal.

Earlier, BJP MP and Forum''s president Kirit Somaiya met DCA secretary V K Dhall and asked for stern action against the Tata group.

The forum had alleged that the decision to invest in Tata Tele was tantamount to violation of certain sections of the Companies Act and Company Law Board.

Somaiya had asked the government for permission under Section 398(1)(a) to make an application for relief in cases of mismanagement.

Tatas had not clarified about Tata Tele''s financial performance and wondered if TTSL had lost its whole equity of Rs 550 crore due to losses incurred in last three years, he noted.

Tatas appeared to have convinced the Centre about the merit of the controversial Rs 1,200 crore investment decision by VSNL in TTSL even while agreeing to take a government nominee in the board committee, which would decide on periodicity and valuation issues.

Meanwhile, VSNL faced default of payment that might go up to Rs 500 crore with its international partner US telecom major WorldCom admitting to an accounting fraud of $4 billion raising fears of the latter''s bankruptcy.

In his letter to the then law minister Arun Jaitley, Somaiya had said that corporate governance demanded approval of shareholders and consent of majority in general meeting and added there was no justification for investment of such a large sum.

9,Haryana anounces first urban policy,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government, on Friday, announced the first urban policy of the state for effective planning, development, resource generation and management of all towns of the state.

Announcing the policy, minister of state for urban development Subhash Goyal said town development plans of areas within the municipal limits of all towns would be prepared within six months from the date of declaration of controlled areas.

The minister said the new policy would also embark on reviewing the technical parameters for setting up of residential colonies and commercial complexes within municipal limits, keeping in view the constraints of nonavailability of vacant lands bigger in area and wider roads required for the grant of licences under the existing policies framed under the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 and rules of 1976.

The government would also take effective steps to check unauthorised colonisation by suitably amending the Act and simplifying and liberalising the licensing procedure, Goyal said.

The minister said that in order to provide an effective deterrent and to check the mushrooming growth of unauthorised colonies, it would be made mandatory to obtain a no-objection certificate from the municipality for registration of any sale deed and provision of any electric, water or sewerage connection by any agency or department in the municipal jurisdiction.

The government would encourage private participation in urban development by granting licenses to small colonisers for areas exceeding 500 square metres for residential and 100 square metres for commercial areas, he said.

Under the new policy, registered architects would prepare building plans in accordance with the zoning plan of the estate and building by-laws and certify them to be in conformity with the building by-laws and zoning.

10,'Reformed' criminals seek immunity from arrests,"AHMEDABAD: A special scheme launched by the police commissioner on July 1, which is aimed at putting an end to police harassment of ''reformed'' history-sheeters, has sprung some surprises.

Not wishing to keep anything to chance is Baldeo Singh Bhatti, a self-confessed former bootlegger. Bhatti, along with his application has submitted recommendation letters (read character certificates) issued by the Congress MLA from Sabarmati, Narhari Amin, and local corporator Jawaharbhai Bhatia.

""I quit the liquor business about four years back and now run a meat shop in Nava Vadaj. But every time there is a festival or an untoward incident, I am detained unnecessarily and interrogated by the police. Only yesterday the local police came to arrest me under section 151 of IPC keeping the Rathyatra in view. I hope this scheme relieves me from further harassment,"" quipped Bhatti.

The other surprise applicant for this ""immunity process"" is a police constable of Bapunagar, who is under suspension after being accused under the Explosives Act in 1994.

Dilawarkhan Pathan, a resident of the Gomtipur area, had been charged with murder during the 1985 riots. ""I was subsequently declared innocent by the court, but my name still figures on the Modus Crime Report (MCR) card. Every time some anti-social activity takes place in my locality, policemen come knocking at my door,"" laments Pathan, who now owns a cable TV business in the area.

A senior police official explained, ""This is a common practice in routine policing. Inquiry into any crime starts with the interrogation of history-sheeters having similar ''modus operandi'' or offence. This method has proved effective on occasions, but on the flip side, it also means harassing reformed convicts.""

Sahid Ahmed is among the 90 who procured the application forms for ""immunity"" on Friday. (Twenty-three duly-filled forms have already been submitted). Ahmed is the business partner of Pathan. Both Pathan and Ahmed are pinning their hopes on this ""novel idea"" of the police commissioner to finally clear their names.

""In 1991, a feud in my locality had led to the murder of one. I was arrested for the offence and sent to jail for five years. And since 1996, I am into the cable TV business and have not committed anything illegal. Yet the police come to my house every now and then and even at unearthly hours, sometimes just to check if I am at home. I hope this process helps me see the last of the police,"" quipped Ahmed.

But, the high hopes of Ahmed and other applicants for ""immunity"" have not stopped them from deciding to leave the city and return only after the Rathyatra is over.

""Otherwise, we will be picked up by the police and shown as preventive arrests. That we have shunned anti-social activities long back and have families to fend for is not considered at all,"" said a 28-year-old reformed history-sheeter, who was arrested in 1989 for burglary and now runs a provision store in the Lal Darwaja area.

""An application has to be submitted along with recent photographs and testimonials from two local residents vouching for the applicant''s genuineness. Information like the date and nature of the crime, current means of earning are also required to be filled in. If the applicants are found genuine, the process will give them a second chance to get back into the mainstream of the society,"" said DCP Rahul Sharma.
