0,"19 dead, 45 hurt in J&K violence","SRINAGAR: Seven security personnel, including an Army Major and a block president of the ruling People''s Democratic Party, were among 19 people killed as militants stepped up attacks in Jammu and Kashmir since Thursday night. Forty-five people were reportedly injured in the attacks.

The escalated violence saw the first suicide attack of the year in the state, where militants made an abortive bid to storm the sector headquarters of the BSF, ambush on an Army patrol and a blast inside a court in Baramulla district of north Kashmir, sources said.

Suspected Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militants on Friday made an abortive bid to storm the sector headquarters of BSF in north Kashmir, triggering a gunbattle, which left three militants, two BSF personnel and a civilian dead.

Three members of the suicide squad approached the sector headquarters at Bagh-Bandipora in Baramulla district from the rear side and hurled grenades and opened fire on the troops working in a garage, wounding two of them, a BSF spokesman said.

The militant then moved towards the main gate and tried to enter forcefully. However, their attempt was foiled by an alert sentry, who engaged them in a gunfight and shot two of them dead. The third militant escaped, the spokesman said.

Six BSF personnel were seriously injured in the encounter, out of which three succumbed to their injuries. The deceased have been identified as Ram Dev Singh, Shabir Ahmed and Mushtaq Ahmed.

A civilian, Ghulam Mohammed Han, hailing from Madar village in Bandipore, also died in the incident. His mutilated body was recovered during the subsequent operation near the main gate.

Prior to the suicide attack, militants ambushed an Army search party, killing a major and a jawan and wounding three other soldiers at Sumblar village, also in Bandipora, early on Friday, sources said.

They said troops fired back but the militants fled away taking advantage of darkness.

In another incident, three persons, including two women, were killed and 34 others injured, when suspected militants triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) inside a local court at Pattan, 27 km from here, on the Srinagar-Baramulla highway, this afternoon.

The blast took place in the complex near the judicial magistrate''s court, killing a woman Nasreen on the spot and wounding 34 others. Two of the injured identified as Fatima and Ghulam Rasool Bhat, succumbed to their wounds while being shifted to the hospital, sources said.

In Jammu district, two Army jawans were killed and two others injured in two separate mine blasts at Makwal and Matal villages on Thursday evening. PDP block president Abdul Gani Malik and a surrendered militant Abdul Ahmad Malik were shot dead by militants inside their houses at Dangiwacha in Baramulla late on Thursday night, sources said.

They said militants also killed three persons identified as Fayaz Ahmad Dar, Javid Ahmad and Farooq Ahmad at Larev and Drangbal in Pulwama district and Handwara in Kupwara district, respectively.

The body of a civilian, Nazir Ahmad Chohan, was recovered by the police from Kellar in Pulwama district on Friday, sources said, adding the deceased had reportedly died in a crossfire between militants and security forces in the village.

Residents of the village staged a protest demonstration on Friday, alleging that Chohan was picked up by the Army on Thursday night for questioning and killed during interrogation.

1,Mamata confidante attempts suicide,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress MLA and party chief Mamata Banerjee''s close confidante, Sonali Guha, was admitted to a Kolkata nursing home on Thursday afternoon after she swallowed 40 sleeping pills in a span of 12 hours.

Relatives broke open the door of Guha''s bedroom and rushed her to the nursing home. She has been put on saline drip and is also being administered oxygen occasionally.

Doctors, however, said she was out of danger.

From her hospital bed, Guha said in the evening that she attempted suicide because her husband Partho Bose was denied the post of chairman of borough V of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). Instead, sitting borough chairperson Pratima Mondol was re-elected to the post by Trinamul and BJP councillors.

Guha blamed KMC mayor-in-council member Pradip Ghosh for her husband''s defeat. ""I could not bear the manner I was insulted. They used filthy language against me and Didi (Mamata). I could not bear it and so I took 40 pills,"" said a tearful Guha.

""Didi wanted Partho to be the new chairman. But Ghosh will not listen to any one. He even dared to say that I wash Didi''s clothes to please her.""

Denying the charges, Ghosh claimed that Mondol was a unanimous choice. ""We have five Trinamul and one BJP councillor in the borough. All of them voted for Mondol and this includes Partho himself,"" he said. ""Why is Sonali blaming me?""

Ghosh on Friday said he had taken up the matter with mayor Subrata Mukherjee and demanded that Partho and Sonali be expelled from the party.

Kolkata Mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Friday supported Ghosh, making it clear that he had given clear instruction to Trinamul functionaries to maintain status quo in all 15 boroughs and retain Mondol as chairperson of borough V. ""The composition of the concerned borough is so complex that if Mondol was replaced by Partho, we would have lost the borough to the Left Front,"" said Mukherjee.

Senior Trinamul leaders remained tightlipped on the issue and even considered it prudent to stay away from the nursing home. According to sources, Ghosh, who is MMIC slum development and was once a confidant of state Congress leader Somen Mitra, had bluntly ruled out Mamata''s suggestion that Mondol be replaced by Partho as the borough committee chairman.

2,"Emulate Andhra, MP in watershed development: Hazare","PUNE: Noted social worker Anna Hazare on Thursday lashed out at the state government for its apathy towards watershed development programmes.

He urged chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to follow in the footsteps of Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Andhra Pradesh (AP), which have successfully implemented such programmes.

Hazare was speaking at a divisional meeting called to review the implementation of the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule watershed development and soil conservation programme at the Yeshwantrao Chavan academy for development administration here on Thursday.

The meeting was also attended by Shinde, some senior cabinet ministers and district collectors, and chief executive officers of zilla parishads from Pune division.

Hazare said, ""Chief ministers and chief secretaries of MP and AP are taking personnel interest in watershed management programmes, resulting in the states surging ahead of Maharashtra in their implementation. Unfortunately, watershed development has not been on the agendas of Maharashtra chief ministers for quite some time now.""

He pointed out that the central grant received by the state under the drought prone areas development programme and national watershed development fund remained unutilised.

Hazare said although Maharashtra had a separate department for watershed development, according to government rules, watershed programmes had to be implemented through the agriculture department. ""There is no co-operation and co-ordination between these two departments,"" he lamented.

While the secretary and minister of the watershed development department did not give money to the agriculture department, which gets funds for these projects, the agriculture department did not spare staff for watershed programmes, he said.

Hazare stressed the need for people''s participation for the success of watershed development, adding, ""There is a urgent need to repair check-dams and percolation tanks which have became obsolete or have been damaged over the years with people''s participation.""

3,Sena-BJP pact is restricted to state polls only: Mahajan,"MUMBAI: The BJP will not strike an electoral alliance with the Shiv Sena outside Maharashtra, nor it will support the Sena''s programme of barring the entry of ''outsiders'' to Mumbai, BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan said on Friday.

He made it clear that the BJP would fight the assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Delhi on its own.Mr Mahajan added that the BJP would not ally with other partners of the National Democratic Alliance for these elections either.

However, he reiterated that the BJP-Sena alliance in Maharashtra was intact and they would fight the next elections in the state together.

Mr Mahajan,who is here to attend a two-day Maharashtra BJP executive committee meeting, told reporters that the Sena''s decision to spread its wings outside Maharashtra was not new. It had in previously fought assembly elections in some states.

In reply to a question, he said that the BJP does not want to impose an alliance with the Sena in other states.

But if a state unit itself wanted such an arrangement, then the request could be discussed.

Mr Mahajan had to field several questions on the Sena chief Bal Thackeray''s criticism of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee''s handling of terrorism and the latest Sena campaign to restrict the influx of people into Mumbai.

He said the PM had extended an olive branch to Pakistan on the one hand but had warned it to stop crossborder terrorism. Mr Thackeray also wanted the killings of the innocent people in the Valley to stop. The sentiments were the same, even though they was expressed in each leader''s individual style, he said.

Regarding the Sena''s demand to stop further population influxes into Mumbai, Mr Mahajan said an important provision of the constitution enabled any citizen to move freely in India.

Moreover, the problem of rapid growth was not confined to Mumbai alone. But he welcomed the idea of a national consensus on this issue.

4,Farooq wants to lead all-party delegation to Pak,"NEW DELHI: Taking a U-turn from his war rhetoric, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah on Friday mooted a proposal to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he be allowed to lead an all-party delegation to Pakistan that will include NCP President Sharad Pawar.

The move, according to Abdullah, was to break the ice between the two countries as there was a lot of calls in the country to bring peace in the region.

Talking to reporters after their 35-minute meeting with Vajpayee, Pawar said the decision to take the initiative came after the Prime Minister made attempts during his Srinagar trip recently to forge peace between the two countries.

Asked about the response from the Prime Minister, both Pawar and Abdullah said that it was ""good"" but added that there was no firm commitment from him.

""Obviously, he (Vajpayee) will be talking to some of his colleauges in the government before taking a decision,"" Pawar said while making it amply clear that the proposed visit of parliamentarians had nothing to do with the government and it was purely a non-governmenatl appraoch.

""We have been spending too much on the non-developmental activities like security related expenditure while ignoring the critical sectors like unemployment, poverty and others,"" Pawar said.

When Abdullah was asked that till Thursday he had been talking about war with Pakistan and why there was a sudden change now, he said, ""the youth of this country want peace. My people are dying every day. Army was at border for 10 months but nothing happened. Now we have to look for peace.""

5,"Gear up for early polls, state BJP told","MUMBAI: The rank and file of the BJP has been directed to start preparations for a mid-term Lok Sabha election as well as the Maharashtra assembly elections, scheduled for September 2004.

Party sources indicated that BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan had asked an executive committee meeting of the Maharashtra BJP here on Friday to galvanise various units and fronts of the party. Sources said holding a Lok Sabha general election in September 2004 was not considered ""politically convenient"" by the NDA for a variety of reasons. The NDA partners want to hold the elections before the monsoons of 2004.

If the elections are held in May, the outgoing government would have to present one more budget.

Since no ruling party would be keen on presenting a budget just before the elections, the ruling NDA may opt for a mid-term poll for the Lok Sabha as early as February 2004.

Addressing nearly 130 important BJP functionaries from across the state at Vile Parle in north-west Mumbai on Friday,Mr Mahajan discussed various pros and cons of the present political scenario and advised the party to begin preparations for the Lok Sabha and assembly elections in the state.

Mr Mahajan, it is learnt, was of the view that the BJP was going to make every effort to improve its performance in the Rajasthan, MP, Chhattisgarh and Delhi assembly elections. Mr Mahajan, who has been appointed coordinator for the four states, all currently under Congress rule, has completed whistlestop tours of these states.

He told executive members that the party should avoid some of its earlier mistakes and learn from its defeat in Himachal Pradesh. ""We have to capitalise on our achievements and depend on the party network,"" he added.

Emphasising the importance of the alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, Mr Mahajan predicted early elections to the state assembly. His assumption was based on an assessment that the ruling Democratic Front government would perhaps not want to face the public simultaneously for both elections.

The DF, he believed, would take a chance and call for assembly elections later this year rather than wait for 2004. He made it absolutely clear to the executive that the seatsharing formula between the two parties would remain the same.

6,HC asks govt to file reply in UPPST case,"LUCKNOW: Close on the heels of the high court quashing appointments of 15 law officers, yet another ''act of favouritism'' by the Mayawati government has come under the court''s scrutiny.

Issuing notices on appointment of a senior retired Dalit IAS officer RB Bhaskar as the vice-chairman (administrative), UP Public Services Tribunal (UPPST), the high court has directed the Mayawati government to file a counter-affidavit within three weeks.

The order was passed by a bench comprising Chief Justice Tarun Chatterjee and Justice YR Tripathi on a writ petition filed by SN Shukla, a retired bureaucrat. Challenging Bhaskar''s appointment, the petitioner contended that it was violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.

Bhaskar was appointed as V-C (admn) UPPST on March 10 by the Mayawati government ignoring the merit and seniority list. Ironically, the government had sent only Bhaskar''s name for concurrence bypassing names of five senior officers of 1965 to 1970 batches who had applied for the post after retirement from services.

The petitioner argued that he was not only senior (retired with chief secretary scale) to him, but also a topper in law, while Bhaskar had retired as principal secretary and was not even a law graduate.

Besides Shukla (1967), claims of SAT Rizvi (1965), PC Sharma, Swaran Das (all 1967) and Dr Surya Prasad (1970), who had also applied for the coveted post, were also ignored in showering favour to Bhaskar. On top of it, his senior Dr Surya Prasad was appointed as a member only, while Bhaskar as V-C (admn).

Interestingly, both Bhaksar and Shukla retired in February this year. While appointing Bhaskar, the government had stated that after retirement gradation or seniority had no relevance and it was absolute discretion of the state government to make appointments.

Disputing this argument, the petitioner quoted the Supreme Court judgment in a Tamil Nadu case which was violative of Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution. ""When the names were sent to the chief justice for concurrence, we both were very much in the service. So the government''s claim that gradation has no relevance after retirement does not hold any water,"" argued the petitioner.

The petitioner charged that Bhaskar''s appointment was made by the Mayawati government either on caste consideration or some extraneous pretext. ""Merit, qualification and seniority was blatantly overlooked and ignored,"" he pointed.

Seeking justice, Shukla, who pleaded his case on his own, sought cancellation of Bhaskar''s appointment. After listening to his argument, the high court directed the Mayawati government to file a counter-affidavit within three weeks.

7,VIPs' red light passport to break traffic rules,"KOLKATA: Even as police vehicles and redlight wielding cars of dignitaries break traffic rules with impunity, the common man shells out hefty fines and keeps the police coffers full.

Currently, the fine for a one-way violation for a private vehicle is Rs 400. Last year, the Kolkata police traffic department collected close to Rs 1.2 crore in fines for one-way violations. This year, till March, over 6,800 cases of one-way violations had been registered.

Since April 1, this fine has been revised to Rs 2,000. Stop sign violations attract a penalty of Rs 100. Ironically, not only are there no clear signs to indicate the one-way timings in many of the roads, but taxis and auto-rickshaws regularly flout these rules. Among the worst violators of traffic rules are the police themselves. For instance, on the narrow stretch of Ripon Street between Free School Street and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road heavy police lorries, jeeps and cars to use it from both ends, one way notwithstanding.

The reason: a police petrol pump is located there. Stop sign violations also attract a stiff penalty, but not if it is an official vehicle of a â€˜high dignitaryâ€™ as described by the Central Motor Vehicles Act, 1989. The use of the beacon on government vehicles is governed by section 108 the Act. Central and state government orders regulate who is entitled to the beacon and the protocol thereof. Among those who are allowed to have red lights on their official vehicles are the governor, chief minister, chief justice of the high court, speaker of the assembly, ministers, leader of the Opposition, accountantgeneral, chief whip of the ruling party and the chief electoral officer.

All secretaries, IGs and above, heads of commissions, the mayor, the sheriff, vice-chancellors and the chairperson of the Kolkata Port Trust are some of the dignitaries allowed to use a red light. The defence and paramilitary forces are also allowed to use red lights. According to state transport department joint secretary Prashant, the red light merely â€œdistinguishes a vehicle carrying persons of certain importance from the othersâ€�. He said, â€œPriority vehicles have pilots with wireless sets constantly transmitting location so that roads can be kept clear for them. They are not required to jump stop signs.â€� â€œVehicles with beacons are priority vehicles because of the nature of duty like an ambulance or a fire engine or keeping mind security threats.

We track movement and ensure they pass through traffic faster,â€� a senior traffic department officer corroborated. Each morning, heads of traffic guards are sent circulars detailing VIP movement in the city, especially of the governor, chief minister and visiting dignitaries, especially those moving with motorcades or pilot and escort vehicles. This is updated during the day.

â€œNone of these vehicles or motorcades are required to jump traffic lights or enter one-ways. We keep the channel of traffic flowing till they have reached their destination or at least the next important crossing,â€� explained the officer. But trying telling that to the common citizen who suffer daily to ensure the speedy passage of â€˜VIPâ€™ cars.

8,Another suicide bid at Metro,"KOLKATA: A 40-year-old man on Friday morning tried to commit suicide by throwing himself in front of a running train at the Esplanade Metro station. A Metro spokesperson said Arjaul Haque jumped on to the tracks just before the Dum Dum bound train entered Esplanade station.

Luckily for him, the alert driver applied emergency brake. The train stopped six inches away from Haque. This takes the number of suicide attempts in the Metro since inception to 99. Forty attempts have been fatal. Haque did not come in contact with the third rail, though he suffered serious head injuries.

Power supply to the third rail was immediately cut off and the victim rushed to SSKM Hospital. Inquiries revealed that Haque is a telecom engineer in a private firm in the Shaw Wallace Building. Deputy commissioner (headquarters) K.L. Tamta said Haqueâ€™s home is in Malda and he lived in Baker hostel in Kolkata. Metro services were disrupted for 45 minutes on Friday.

Normal service was resumed around 10.45 am. The Metro has emerged as the top suicide spot with 13 deaths and 25 attempts in 2002 alone. This year, four suicide attempts have already been made with two people having died. However, during the first three years of operations from October 1984 to July 1987, there was not a single suicide.

9,State govt told to pay for school seats by June 30,"RANCHI: Bihar may have to forego its share of reserved seats in the three most prestigious residential schools of Jharkhand if it fails to pay the proportionate running cost of the institutions by June 30.

A letter sent to the Jharkhand government by the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry in November last year said that seats in the three schools â€” Netarhat Residential School, Indira Gandhi Residential School at Hazaribag and Sainik School at Tilaiya â€” would be divided between the two states in proportion to population that is 3:2, which works out at 75 per cent seats for Bihar and the rest 25 per cent for students of Jharkhand.

However, the reservation according to the directive of the Centre is conditional. First, the proportionate cost of running the schools would have to be paid by both states by June 30 failing which the facility is to be withdrawn from the defaulter state. Second, this arrangement would stand for a period of five years or till the time Bihar comes up with such institutions â€” whichever is earlier.

Since its creation in November 2000, Jharkhand had been bearing the running cost of the three schools amounting to Rs 16 crore. Following the Centreâ€™s directive, Jharkhand HRD secretary Amit Khare worked out the cost to be recovered from Bihar at Rs 12 crore for the years 2001-02 and 2002-03 and accordingly informed Bihar education secretary B B Srivastava on December 20 last year.

Subsequent to Khareâ€™s letter, Bihar sought details from Jharkhand regarding the total expenditure under both the plan and non-plan heads, recurring cost, capital expenditure etc.

Though the details were sent by the Jharkhand HRD department on February 26, Bihar is yet to respond. With two months to go before the deadline set by the Centre expires, the Jharkhand government would have no option but to withdraw the seat reservation facility.

10,Plea for engg fee increase,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka State Unaided New Engineering Collegesâ€™ Association is meeting here on Saturday to prevail upon the government to hike the fee structure for engineering courses.

Urban development minister D.K. Shivakumar, who runs Global Academy of Technology, Bangalore, told The Times of India that the fee prescribed by the government was less. â€œPrivate schools collect a donation of Rs 25,000, how can the fee in engineering colleges be just Rs 11,590,â€™â€™ he asked.

He said the association was not party to decisions taken by the Karnataka Unaided Professional Colleges, headed by Shamnur Shivashankrappa.

â€œWe will ask the government to enhance the engineering courses fee from Rs 11,590 to Rs 36,000 (government quota), Rs 46,590 to Rs 60,000 (Karnataka payment seats) and from Rs 75,590 to Rs 90,000 (non-Karnataka payment quota). Under the present fee structure, we are not able to pay salaries as per AICTE scales, while the question of improving infrastructure does not arise,â€™â€™ he said.

13,First round of Pak Govt-Oppn talks inconclusive,"ISLAMABAD: The first round of talks between the Pakistan Government and the opposition to resolve differences over legality of President Pervez Musharraf''s Presidency and his constitutional amendments have ended inconclusive with the opposition saying its agitation in Parliament would continue.

The talks, which stretched into late last night, were held between Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali and leaders of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz.

""We have identified seven contentious issues, including President keeping office of Chief of Army, his discretionary powers to dismiss Parliament, National Security Council etc and would like to hold talks on them,"" MMA Vice President Qazi Hussain Ahmad told reporters after the talks.

The opposition would, however, ""continue its agitation in Parliament,"" he said.

Ahmad said the government also briefed the opposition about implications of the continued row between the treasury and the opposition in Parliament.

Jamali, meanwhile, expressed optimism about the dialogue and said ""differences were not as big as Qazi sahib wants to show"".

""The talks were held in a cordial manner, although little discussions were held. We are taking things forward with the hope of resolving issues by mutual consent as both sides are eager to continue the process of dialogue and creating understanding with each other,"" he said.

14,Bhutto directs PPP leaders to revitalise party,"ISLAMABAD: As the deadlock continues between Pakistan government and the opposition over the legality of Pervez Musharraf''s presidency and constitutional amendments, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto has directed leaders of her Pakistan Peoples Party to revitalise it.

Without making direct reference to any possibility of mid-term polls, Bhutto in a letter to partymen said, ""the party should emerge as a single majority party in Sindh, Punjab, NWFP and Baluchistan.""

Despite a ban on self-exiled Bhutto from contesting the polls, the PPP won the highest number of votes in the October general elections, finishing second.

Meanwhile, her party has hit out at Musharraf for his criticism of Bhutto in his meeting with editors on Thursday, in which he called her and exiled former Premier Nawaz Sharif ""plunderers and looters.""

""Last week at the formation commanders meeting of the Army, the General (Musharraf) betrayed how the ghost of Bhuttos haunted him. Instead of addressing the security concerns of the country, the General accused the PPP and Bhutto for alleged corruption,"" PPP said in a statement.

It claimed that Musharraf himself was exposed as taking instructions from ""foreign masters"", accusing him of toeing the US line.

The PPP also flayed Musharraf for having said the delay in judicial proceedings was responsible for the continuing imprisonment of Bhutto''s husband Asif Ali Zardari.

""Can the General keep his hand on his heart and claim that the regime has not interfered in the judicial process,"" the statement asked.

16,Warhorses rule the roost in Parliament,"NEW DELHI: Politics has now become the last refuge of the gerontocracy. Or so it seems.

Statistics indicate the present Lok Sabha has 73 MPs between 66-85 years of age. And their numbers are rising. Contrast this with the first Lok Sabha where the average age of MPs was 45. Today, thereâ€™s a discernible drop in the number of MPs between 25-35 years.

Congress warhorse, K Karunakaran is 85 and still going strong. His Lok Sabha colleague, Congress MP, Atma Ram Maganbhai Patel, from Mehsana in Gujarat, is also 85. And he gives colleagues half his age a run for their money at the hustings.

The BJP too has its share of old, but not infirm, men. BJP veteran Nanaji Deshmukh, Rajya Sabha MP, is 86. Lt Col (retd) Maharja Narendra Shah, BJP Lok Sabha MP from Tehri Garhwal, will turn 82 next month. Among women parliamentarians, Krishna Bose, Trinamul Congress, takes the honours. She is the oldest at 73. In fact, the majority of high- profile MPs now are all over 70 years. Leading the pack is PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee at 79. Sprightly L K Advani and Jagmohan follow at 75. And by George, Fernandes is 72.

So why this trend? CPM veteran Somnath Chatterjee says, â€˜â€˜This is disconcerting. Young people today are critical of politicians, but my party keeps telling them that itâ€™s not enough to be an armchair critic. If they want to change the system, they must join politics.â€™â€™

Akali Dal leader Simranjit Singh Mann is also worried. â€˜â€˜Sometimes when I look at the greyheads in Parliament, I feel we have become part of the Rip Van Winkle syndrome. The world has altered dramatically and yet, here we have leaders who continue to spout the old Fabian socialistic jargon.â€™â€™

For deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Najma Heptullah, a House of white-haired, sleeping MPs is cause for concern. â€˜â€˜It is obvious they are no longer concerned with what is happening inside the House. All the lobbying and deals are taking place outside the House.â€™â€™ Congressâ€™ Mani Shanker Aiyar says, â€˜â€˜Top leaders prefer to hand out tickets to those of their peer group. â€™â€™

Modern medicine, too, has kept the old fighting fit. â€˜â€˜Look at Vajpayee. He has already made it clear heâ€™s willing to lead his party into the next elections. I was recently introduced by Arjun Singh as a promising young man in the Congress when I am 62.â€™â€™

Congress MP Renuka Choudhary says she entered the Rajya Sabha at 29 years. â€˜â€˜Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was also lucky â€” he entered at 27 years. The only people who can retire us is the public. But since they have faith in us, we keep coming back.â€™â€™ Some olden era, this.

17,Couple arrested for grabbing land,"NEW DELHI: A couple has been arrested by Delhi Police economic offence wing (EOW) for grabbing properties worth over 25 crores at prime locations in south Delhi.

Deputy commissioner of police (EOW) Dinesh Bhatt said: â€˜â€˜We have arrested Sanjay Grover and Seema Grover for allegedly conniving with some property dealers to grab a property worth Rs 20 crore in Panchsheel Marg and another worth Rs 5 crore in Westend.â€™â€™

The complainant Naseeb Kapoor said that her late grandmother Sita Singh was the owner of a 2,000 sq yard plot at Panchsheel and a 500-sq yard plot at Westend.

In 1999, Sita Singh had made a gift deed for the Westend property, wherein she created a trust in her own name. In her will she wrote that the Sita Singh Trust would hold, manage, administer and develop the said property for her then divorced elder daughter Seema and her son Tushar. In May 1999, Singh gifted the Panchsheel property to the complainant and her

sister Radil Tuli.

Singh came to know that a savings bank account has been opened by her daughter Seema using forged property papers. She then informed the bank to freeze the account. The police investigation revealed that one Rajesh Sharma and Ashutosh Parashar had claimed in court that they had purchased the Westend and Panchsheel properties for Rs 21 lakh and Rs 47 lakh respectively. The market value of the said properties are in crores. Bhatt said: â€˜â€˜In 1999, Sita Singh was getting an annual rent of Rs 78 lakh from her Panchsheel property which is on lease to the Lebanese embassy. It is learnt that Sharma and Parashar are first cousins and have conspired with Seema and her second husband, Sanjay Grover.â€™â€™

The EOW has arrested Seema and Sanjay and said more arrests are likely to be made in the case.
