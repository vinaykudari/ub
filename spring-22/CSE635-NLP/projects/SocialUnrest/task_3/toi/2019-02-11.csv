0,Delhi govt for putting all buses on CNG,"new delhi: the delhi government is planning to buy more cng buses for the delhi transport corporation (dtc) as part of an aggressive clean air programme for the polluted capital. transport minister ajay maken said that his government was concerned about the effect pollution was having on public health. it would continue to provide a tax incentive and make other efforts to encourage use of a clean fuel. so far its efforts to switch to cng had been stymied by the union government which had gone slow in providing cng dispensing stations. this had created confusion in the minds of transport operators and inconvenienced the public. ""the delhi government is all for cng,"" maken said. ""we have been misunderstood as blocking it. we have become the whipping boy for the sc. but nobody credits us for bringing in 46,000 cng vehicles within two years. it''s a bit unfair."" the delhi government forgoes sales tax on cng to encourage use of a clean fuel. this means a loss of rs 110 crore a year to the state. the centre on the other hand raised the duty on cng in the last budget. maken said that as per the wishes of the sc the state government wants to phase out diesel buses. ""it is because we believe that cng is cleaner than diesel. and all three-wheelers converted to cng are showing good results."" maken lashed out at the union petroleum and surface transport ministries: ""they have not been serious enough about implementing the apex court''s orders."" there was enough cng but the petroleum ministry had done little for its distribution. he said, ""private operators are wary of converting their vehicles because there aren''t enough gas dispensing stations. the ministry should allot enough gas and equip delhi with an adequate number of dispensing stations."" the union government had created stumbling blocks at every stage.""cng has not been in the high priority list of the union government. they notified the safety norms for cng only in november last year whereas they should have been in place much earlier. this shows the laxity on the part of the surface transport ministry."" besides availability and safety, maken said that fear looms large over the private transporters on the price of cng: ""(union petroleum minister) ram naik has time and again said that mumbai''s cng price is higher than delhi. so, they are considering raising the delhi price. but why don''t they think positive and bring down mumbai''s prices to make it par with delhi?"" he said that if the union government puts a cap on the cng prices for at least three years, then all private operators would rush for conversion of their venicles or purchase of new ones. ""all these decisions by transporters are economics-driven. the union government, therefore, must try and make the environment more lucrative for these bus operators,"" he said. he said that the delhi government was eager to put the entire fleet of buses in the city on cng by august 2004 if the union petroleum ministry provided the gas for 200 buses every month.

1,Congman plays up family card against ex-school principal,"pathankot: the congress candidate from dinanagar, aruna chaudhary, is cashing in on the goodwill of his late father-in-law, jai munni, who represented the dinanagar reserve constituency five times, and the omissions and commissions of roop rani, who did not get the bjp ticket.the bjp has fielded sita ram kashyap, a retired school principal. while aruna has been claiming the support of the 23,000-strong mahashya community, kashyap is banking on the 13,000 mahajan votes and the 15,000 sikh votes in the constituency. while kashyap is seeking votes on the plea that as an elected municipal councillor he had done a lot for this town, his campaign is centred on exposing the ""outsider"", aruna, settled since a decade in panchkula. ""she may not visit your constituency at all after getting elected, while i have been here and will stay with you.who will come to your rescue? you will have to travel all the way to chandigarh to get your things done,"" he has been heard telling voters. besides himachal pradesh ministers desh raj krishan kapoor, rakesh pathania and vidya sagar, union public distribution and consumer affairs minister shanta kumar had also been campaigning for kashyap, addressing six rallies in his favour on friday. aruna, whose campaign has been led by former congress mp from gurdaspur sukhbans kaur bhinder, has blamed the sad-bjp leaders for the recent death in police custody of a dalit youth, who was allegedly arrested at the behest of a local akali leader. while aruna''s protest led to the suspension of four policemen, the administration is yet to make public the post-mortem report. aruna has been meeting sarpanches of the area and assuring them that if elected she would solve their problems on priority basis. sita ram kashyap, on the other hand, has been telling voters that having lived all his life in border villages, he knew more about the problems of these areas than anybody else. meanwhile, the all india christian dalit front stated that christians in dinanagar would vote for the bjp, as the badal government, during its five-year term, had taken several measures for the upliftment of the community.

2,Mumbai records low turnout for civic polls,"mumbai: contrary to expectations, the city recorded a turnout of barely 40 per cent in the civic polls.the final results will be known by monday evening. however, election in ward no. 24 (mazgaon docks-godapdeo) has been postponed to february 17 after the polling staff discovered that the ballot papers had the names of just five of the six candidates. â€œadditional municipal commissioner vidyadhar kanade will conduct an inquiry into the lapse,â€� municipal commissioner karun srivastava said. it is learnt that the ballot papers were printed at the government printing press. the polls were peaceful barring a few minor incidents of stonethrowing and a clash between shiv sena and ncp workers at mazgaon. police commissioner m.n. singh said there was no incident of booth capturing although there were 20 cases of bogus voting. these include six cases in the northern suburbs, four in western, seven in central and three in south mumbai. however, municipal commissioner karun srivastava said only five cases of bogus voting were reported to him by his staff. according to singh, the sena and ncp workers clashed at mazgaon and hurled stones at each other. â€œthe situation was brought under control within a few minutes after a constable fired a round in the air,â€� he said. the supporters of both the parties later lodged complaints at the byculla police station. no arrests were made in this connection. minor stone throwing incidents were witnessed at bit chawl in nagpada, kurla and oshivara. however, no one was injured. apart from widespread complaints of bogus voting, another feature of the polls were the number of people turned away from polling booths because their names did not figure on the votersâ€™ list. shiv sena chief bal thackeray was one of them and the incident led to tension in kherwadi till the civic officials explained that the bmc had gone by the 1998 votersâ€™ list. thackeray had been disenfranchiesd for six years by the election commission in 1995 for making communal speeches in the 1986 state assembly elections. there were complaints about bogus voting in eksar village in borivli. in kurla east, congress candidate rajhans singh and samajwadi party candidate sunil ganacharya, have alleged that several polling agents were permitting voters without ids to vote, even when others protested. in ramabai nagar, ghatkopar, independent candidate dr harish ahir alleged that when one of his supporters wanted to file a complaint of bogus voting, the polling agent refused to do, only taking the complaint down when ahir himself landed up. in ward number 92 in parle, heated arguments were witnessed between election officials and three candidates --congress candidate alka chandewar, independents sheela rao and vidyalaxmi kasture -- at the polling station on the shahaji raje marg, after the latter alleged that voters not carrying identification cards were permitted to vote. reports filtering in at the civic headquarters control room from various polling booths in the city on sunday night indicated that ward no 87 (tps 3 santa cruz-chaitanya nagar) saw the highest voter turn out of 75 per cent. thousands of voters returned home without exercising their franchise when they discovered their names were not on the voters list. the bmc is using the 1998 assembly election votersâ€™ list, with the recent enumeration of voters compiled in supplementary lists.

3,DMs told to prepare for municipal elections,"patna: the state election commission (sec) has set the ball rolling for municipal elections in bihar by issuing orders to district magistrates-cum-district election officers to make preparations for the polls. even though the sec letter does not mention the exact date of polls saying only that the municipal polls will be held in near future, the commission has given instructions regarding setting up of polling booths, filing of nomination papers and allotment of symbols to candidates. the patna high court has been putting pressure on the state government to hold elections for five nagar nigams (municipal corporations), 32 nagar parishads (municipalities) and 78 nagar panchayats (notified area committees) since the holding of panchayat polls last year. the sec has asked the dms to adhere strictly to the patna municipal corporation preparation of electoral rolls and election rules (1953). the sec letters says there should be at least one polling booth in a ward for every 800 to 1,000 voters. the dms have been asked to make arrangements for separate polling booths for members of the weaker sections near their residences even if their number is less than 500. the sec letter says polling booth is to be set up in a room or hall having entry and exit doors. if the room has only one door, a temporary partition is to be made. while selecting a building for polling booth, the dms must ensure that it can be reused as a booth in case of repolling. the distance of a polling booth from the residence of a voter should not exceed three km and should remain within the ward concerned. the letter maintains that as far as possible government and semi-government buildings like schools and community halls should be used as polling booths. separate polling booths should be set up for voters suffering from diseases like leprosy. for ensuring free and fair polling, mobile polling booths may be set up for voters belonging to the weaker sections. for allotment to candidates, the sec has suggested 15 symbols like blackboards, plane, car, candles, balloon etc and reserved 30 more symbols to be used if the number of candidates in a ward exceeds 15. regarding filing of nomination papers, the sec has asked the dms to strictly follow rule 14 of the patna municipal corporation act, 1951, which disqualifies a candidate if he or she is not a citizen of india or is disqualified by any law court for election to the state legislature or is in service of the union or state government.

4,Bhagalpur police firing unrestrained: Probe report,"patna: ""the police firing and its fatal consequences could have been avoided if the university administration had taken timely action regarding the legitimate protest of students against the fee hike in tilka manjhi bhagalpur university, effected from november, 2001, despite the fact that the governor, the chancellor of universities, had not approved it."" it has been noted in the probe report of the lok adhikar sangathan (las) that looked into the bhagalpur firing incident. a two-member las team, comprising bela bhatia and k c philip, during its stay in bhagalpur from february 5 to 8, talked to a cross-section of people, officials and students. in its report, the las has blamed the officials, including the sdo, the nathnagar bdo and city dysp, for ordering ""effective firing"" there. ""why did the police resort to firing above the waist, not below the knees, if the intention was to merely injure, and not to kill, even if the order of firing was a necessity there?"" the report says. the probe report also put a question mark on the claims of the district administration and the university authorities that ""anti-social"" elements had mixed up with the mob of agitating students. ""the victim of the firing incident, mohammad shahabuddin, a poor tailor, has no past record of being an anti-social. even then he was pulled from the verandah and killed by the vc''s guard. but in the fir, the killer was mentioned as an ''unknown person'',"" the report says. both bela and philip talked to the senior police officials, including the ssp. a senior police official at bhagalpur told them that mentioning the name of the guard would have demoralised the police force. he admitted that it was the ""only dark spot"" in the incident. the probe team also met the jailed students. they maintained that the amdinistration was biased against them as members of the left confederation and rjd were arrested, while bjp and samata party members were not arrested. ""also, nonbailable sections were imposed against them, once they gave their identification,"" the report notes. ""releasing them in a phased manner on stringent bail grounds might have been a strategic requirement of the administration, but from the viewpoint of jailed students it was unjustified,"" the report remarks. the las probe team has criticised the vc for his ""authoritarian style"" of functioning.

5,Row over varsity exam fee hike takes a political turn,"vadodara: the row over the hike of examination fee at ms university now seems to have become a political issue which is being exploited for the by-elections to the sayajigunj assembly constituency. so much so that congress legislative party (clp) leader naresh raval raked up the issue here on sunday. the clp leader dragged the issue out of the msu campus here by saying that it was a drama to mislead the electorate. ""bjp functionaries at the university were responsible for the hike. now, they have asked student leaders in their fold to demand that the fee must be reduced,"" raval said. he claimed that the demand for fee reduction by bjp-leaning akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad (abvp) leaders would be accepted creating an impression that they did this in the interest of people at large. ""the end result is that the electorate would support the bjp,"" raval said. raval, who is in the city to oversee preparations for the polls, said that such stunts should end. when it was pointed out to raval that the issue might be too insignificant to affect the polls, he argued that it would definitely influence collegian voters. ""there are several young voters in the university. this episode will definitely affect their voting trend,"" raval said. raval said that his party was against any fee hike, but at the same time it does not want that the students be made instruments of political gimmicks. ""some congress-minded student leaders may have also joined the agitation initially, but that was as an instant reaction to the decision to raise the fee,"" he said. notably, national students union of india (nsui) leaders had joined the agitation in the initial stages, but withdrew later. at the same time, they maintained that they were against the fee hike. raval demanded that the issue must be settled at the earliest. ""the next meeting of the syndicate must take care of the problem,"" he said. meanwhile, uttar pradesh congress committee (upcc) general secretary and observer for the sayajigunj polls o.p. jindal expressed confidence that the party would win the seat. ""the race is for the second post between the bjp and jaspal singh,"" he said. ""we are gaining the confidence of the voters. besides this, the party is visibly united for the polls,"" jindal said.

6,Professor make lab equipment from junk,"pune: cash-strapped educational institutions, particularly government-aided higher secondary schools and junior colleges, will get much-needed succour if prof avinash joshi and his team succeed in their mission. do-it-yourself-with-what-you-have is the message prof joshi and his team are trying to propagate. and it should go down well in a country where laboratory equipment can be expensive and educational institutions donâ€™t always have the cash to invest. for the past five years, this senior scientist at the department of physics in the university of pune is working overtime to use junk materials to develop low-cost substitutes. and helping him achieve his goal are two determined professors from the nowrosjee wadia college, dr farhat surve and v h rajbagkar. take the one-inch two-dimensional grating used for measuring the thickness of a fabric and other materials. it costs rs 1,400 in the market. a computer-generated technique developed by dr farhat is not only cheaper, it also enables students to study different diffraction patterns. similarly, total internal reflection (the methodology used in fibre optic cables) and transparency of different materials can be studied by using just a glass full of particulate materials and a simple circuit. acording to these innovators, educational institutions can happily do without expensive dark rooms, sodium lamps, spectrometers, telescopes and high resolution gratings if the low-cost alternatives developed by them are adopted for experiments in optics and acoustics. â€œthe problem with most institutions is that they canâ€™t afford to provide individual equipment to each student.as a result, most lessons are only explained from the textbooks, without any practical experiments or demonstrations,â€� prof joshi says. the low cost alternatives the group has worked out are already in use at the rourkie-based indian institute of technology; ignou; institute of physics, bhubaneshwar; regi-onal engineering colle-ge, tiruchirapalli; kochi institute of science and technology; the jawah-arlal nehru planetarium in bangalore and the physical research lab-oratory in ahmedabad, to name a few. dr farhat, who bagged this yearâ€™s best teacher award of the university of pune, will be propagating this concept at the kansas state university and the university of new york and buffalo in the united states later this year. â€œthe idea is to stimulate the scientific temperament among students. do-it-yourself-with-what-you-have is the idea that we are trying to propagate in their minds,â€� he says. â€œthese open-ended experiments in optics and acoustics not only demonstrate a particular concept, but are also low-cost and so affordable by meagrely funded institutions in developing countries,â€� he says.

7,Civic polls hits an all-time low,"pune: a marked low turnout of voters marred the pune municipal corporation (pmc) elections to the 116 municipal wards falling in 38 panels. an all-time low polling (52 per cent) was recorded in the city on sunday. the 1997 civic elections had recorded 60.72 per cent polling while the earlier lowest polling percentage of 57.80 was recorded in 1992. the disinterest shown by the middle-class and higher middle-class sections in the election process, despite the introduction of the panel system, was evident from the polling figures in the slum-dominated pockets as against the polling figures in the panels comprising plush localities. the netaji bose vidyalaya panel, comprising slum-dominated areas in yerwada, recorded the highest polling (61.65 per cent), while salisbury park panel recorded the lowest (41.37 per cent). the candidates have, however, blamed the low turnout for the decision making it mandatory for voters to bring along identification documents. shiv sena candidate ramesh bodke said, â€œthough many voters from kasba peth have moved to suburban areas like kothrud, their names still figure in the voter lists at kasba peth. they had come to vote, but were restrained from casting their ballot as they had not brought along identity proof.â€� jaya kirad, congress candidate from the rasta peth power house panel, also blamed the insistence on identification documents and the introduction of the panel system. he said that due to the panel system a voter had to sign and stamp on three ballot papers which took more time than normal. the long queues had put off the voters who left without exercising their franchise, he added. additional municipal commissioner d.s. zagade, however, refused to accept that the insistence on voter identity and the panel system had led to the low turnout. he pointed out that areas like yerwada, panch haud and sahakarnagar-padmavati had recorded more than 55 per cent polling. the pimpri-chinchwad municipal corporation (pcmc) recorded 59.20 per cent polling. as many as 718 candidates contested the polls for 105 seats. polling was by and large peaceful in the twin township. however, incidents of bogus voting were reported from yamunanagar (nigdi) and landewadi (bhosari) and a mob crossed the 100-metre limit near the indira gandhi vidyalaya polling station in pimpri camp. a total absence of pimpri-chinchwad municipal transport (pcmt) buses was witnessed on the pune-mumbai highway, especially after 3 pm. the buses were reportedly used for picking up the election paraphernalia from voting centres. meanwhile, the swargate police have arrested mahesh phadtare, husband of independent candidate jamuna phadtare from the maharshinagar panel, for allegedly attacking congress workers in bibvewadi. in another incident, the khadak police booked one suresh jadhav for distributing saris among women voters in the kasewadi area. jadhav was allegedly inducing women to vote for ncp candidate ranjit buddhiwant from panel no. 44, sonavne hospital. voter apathy at koregaon park.

8,Memories of caste clashes haunt voters,"hastinapur, meerut: the bitter memories of two bloody caste clashes in january 1996 in nearby ikwara and pali villages in which 13 persons were brutally done to death continue to haunt the voters in this rural reserved assembly segment. attempts by campaigners of different party candidates, specially bahujan samaj party (bsp), to divide the voters on caste line by arousing passions are already on. several banners and posters on both sides of the meerut-kotdwar road leading to this erstwhile capital of kaurava and pandavas days indicate the party campaigners'' attempts to refresh those bitter memories. ""have you forgotten the ikwara-pali killings?"" these posters remind you. while the party campaigners who may be benefited by the division of dalit-gujjar votes stoutly deny any such attempts by them, the authorities concerned say these campaigners are definitely trying to foment the trouble in these villages. ""we have repeatedly warned the parties against any attempt to create law and order situation by arousing caste feelings,"" said district magistrate (meerut) avneesh awasthi. ""and for that we are not only holdings meetings with these people but also keeping close vigil on them,"" he added. a visit to mawana, hastinapur and its nearby villages showed that some local issues may also influence the poll. voters in this constituency seem to be angry with the local bjp sitting mla atul kumar and the mp avtar singh bhadana for their failure to get the mawana and hastinapur towns linked with the rail line. bus is the only mode of public transport to reach these towns. while the main meerut-kotdwar road which passes through the mawana town is full of potholes, mawana town even lack basic civic amenities. it does not even have a proper bus stand. the resentment against atul kumar for his failure to do anything for the constituency after he was elected as bjp mla from here in 1996 poll had forced bjp state unit to deny him the ticket this time. the bjp has fielded a woman candidate geeta prakash from here. an ""outsider,"" geeta is being seen as a weak candidate. on the other hand, haryana chief minister om prakash chautala''s inld has fielded former bjp mla gopal kali from here. kali, known for his tremendous influence in the constituency, was elected from here as a bjp mla during the last assembly polls in 1993.

9,Brahmins set to stage a comeback in politics,"khurja: in this small bustling town on the grand trunk road, rakesh pandit of the congress and anil sharma of the bahujan samaj party, both first-timers in the electoral fray, are brahmins, while the bjp and the samajwadi party have fielded thakurs. devesh sharma, who runs a small medical store in khurja city, says he will vote for the congress this time, because the bjp - which got his vote last time - has gone back on its promises: ""the bjp took our votes in the name of ram, but all we got was an inflammatory situation and no ram temple. at least rajiv gandhi was better - he quietly got the locks opened so hindus could worship there. what has the bjp done but create communal tension?"" and then he adds, ""everyone votes for his own community so what is wrong if we vote for a fellow brahmin?"" asked why not the bsp candidate, sharma says, ""we prefer the congress candidate."" the brahmins, who migrated to the bjp in the wake of the ram janambhoomi movement, appear to be rethinking their options this time, and their strategy appears to be: get as many brahmins into the assembly, regardless of the party symbol. for this community, which once had a stranglehold over the state politics, while being about 9 per cent of the population, the last decade has been a trying period. the decline of the congress'' political fortunes, the rise of the sp with its yadav-muslim axis, and the overtly anti-brahmin bsp, pushed them towards the bjp. but when even the bjp began to give an increasing number of tickets to the obcs and dalits, to counter the sp and the bsp, their share in power began to shrink. cashing in on this dissatisfaction, all major political parties have given a sizeable chunk of tickets to the brahmins. if the bjp has allotted 59 tickets, the congress has topped it by fielding 73 brahmins. even the bsp has lured 36 brahmins with the promise of a tranferrable vote bank, and its leader mayawati makes it a point to mention that she has fielded 85 upper caste members. and the sp has given tickets to 26 brahmins. a tour of western up reveals that the main beneficiaries of this experiment are the bsp and the congress. for instance, the bsp''s brahmin candidates in hathras and iglas in mahamayanagar district, and khair in aligarh district, are the current frontrunners. in khair''s arana village, an elderly brahmin farmer, shankar saran, describes the bsp''s pramod gaur - the only brahmin in the fray - as ""young, resourceful and brahmin"" and says he is voting for him. the congress, too, is in a commanding position in barauli in aligarh district, where the brahmins are backing dinesh sharma. in barkha, bjp workers unhappy at the seat being given to ajit singh''s rashtriya lok dal - even though the bjp came second here in 1996 and secured the maximum number of votes in this assembly segment in the 1999 lok sabha elections - are campaigning for sharma.

10,Need for special law to deal with terror stressed,"lucknow: â€œthe indian penal code, criminal procedure code and indian evidence act have now become obsolete and have proved to be inadequate to deal even with ordinary crimes,â€� said chairman, state law commission, kn goyal on sunday during the valedictory session of the seminar on â€˜â€˜the challenge of terrorism, organised crime and collective violence: ramifications and responseâ€™â€™ held at the social work department of the lucknow university. â€œindia needed a special law to deal with terrorism,â€� he said. â€œevery law can be abused. so, after creating new laws, we have to think how best that law can be put to use. and for it, we need efficient government and an honest police force,â€� he added. he pointed out that while the us had taken strict measures to curb the menace of terrorism, india was still dealing with it with age-old laws. while inaugurating the seminar on sunday, kamal kumar, director, national institute of criminology and forensic sciences, said: â€œindia is the only country facing the burnt of all types of terrorism â€” secessionist, left wing, communal, religious and ethnic. but, it is also perhaps the only country having no statutory law to tackle terrorism. poto has already got mired in controversy and tada was allowed to lapse on the grounds of alleged misuse by the police and state machineries,â€� he said adding, this logic needed analysis since everything had a potential for its misuse. â€œafter all, we do not close down our pesticide factories because pesticides can be used by criminal elements to cause homicide,â€� he said. speaking on the â€˜response to terrorismâ€™, he said that political response to terrorism was important as it was aimed at political power only. the punjab experience was an example, he said. â€œon the economic front, hawala channels should be blocked and on social front masses should be educated against the evil designs of terrorists. the requirement of any meaningful counter-terrorist endeavour, thus, should be multi-pronged and systematic,â€� he said. organised criminal gangs, on the other hand, used â€˜corruptionâ€™ and â€˜selective violenceâ€™ as tools to threaten institutions and individuals. a trend had started where criminals had started infiltrating lawful businesses and political set up of the country. they dealt systematically with narco-terrorism, narco-communalism, trafficking in human organs, real estate sharks, contract killing, bank fraud, credit card fraud and cyber crimes. they pose the biggest threat to the nation and if not checked with effective political determination, one day they would marginalise the genuine political leadership, he said. prominent among others who spoke on the occasion were justice (retired) sha raza, lu v-c prof sb singh, dean, faculty of arts, surindar singh and senior lu teachers.

11,When enforcers of law give law the go-by,"new delhi: law must take its own course, but if the law -enforcing agencies choose to evolve a course parallel to the law of the land, the consequences could well be imagined. chief judicial magistrate narendra kumar jain, who fears a threat to his life by the men in uniform and yet has been living under police protection for the past nine years, can testify to this. what was jain''s fault? the no-nonsense magistrate would not allow the police to take the law in its own hands. for instance, the investigating officers could not forge and fabricate case diaries. the strict disciplinarian would not approve handcuffing of undertrials as the supreme court banned such a draconian practice long time ago. the police felt the judicial officer was a hurdle in keeping law and order under control. so what was to be done with such an officer? jain learnt it the hard way. after he ordered the bareilly (up) district police chief to explain why under-trials were still handcuffed despite a ban by the apex court, a false fir of demanding bribe was registered against him. jain began his quest for justice. the state''s judicial officers filed a writ petition in the supreme court seeking several directives aimed at ensuring that the judiciary is not prevented by the law enforcing agencies from performing its job fearlessly and freely. the apex court had earlier dealt with the case of a gujarat judicial magistrate. the nadiad magistrate, who was known for passing strictures on the police and pulling it up for various omissions and commissions, was tied with a rope by the police, paraded on the streets and made to drink urine. there were many similarities in the modus operandi of the police, irrespective of the state it belonged to. the court ordered that no case could be registered against any judicial officer without prior sanction of the state chief justice. the petition, involving important issues relating to judicial independence, was transferred to a five-judge constitution for proper hearing. the hearing by the apex court is awaited. the case should be an eye-opener for the president, the prime minister, the home ministry, the law ministry and the supreme court, said foundation for law reform president v n saraf. ""unless there is policing on the police, the common man would continue to suffer,"" he added. in jain''s case, the high court asked the up government to order a cbi probe into the allegations in the fir. in its report, the cbi confirmed that the police officers were aggrieved by the strictures passed on them by jain. the police officers also ""conspired""with the complainant in lodging the fir. ""the allegation have been found to be false"". but, the special court is yet to take a decision on the cbi''s plea for sanction to prosecute the police officers concerned and others who lodged the fabricated fir against jain. truth has prevailed in jain''s case, but truth must always prevail.

12,Left Front buries govt's plan on illegal madarsas,"kolkata: in a bid to correct itself politically, following the madrasa controversy, the ruling left front here on sunday said that the state government would go strictly by its declared policies on the unaffiliated madarsas and schools. the statement was signed by chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee, his predecessor jyoti basu and other senior front leaders while it seems to be the endorsement of bhattacharjee''s strong reservations about the unrecognised madrasas, other cpm leaders and lf partners insisted on a â€˜balanced position'' on all privately-run institutions. the schools run by ""rss and christian missionaries also should come under the purview,"" said a senior cpi leader. the lf admitted that its government had no information about the unaffiliated madarsas, junior and senior high schools following delhi board. ""but decisions would be taken according to clear, professed and practised policies,"" said the statement. ""while the centre is desperately trying to decimate the system in the country,"" the statement continued, ""the west bengal government has been trying to make education people-oriented, scientific and modernised."" describing the evolution of madrasas in the state, the statement said, the lf government-recognised madarsas had gone up from 237 in 1977 to 507 in 2000. it also warned against the ""divisive conspiracy to trigger tension and confusion within the muslim community"" over an ""unwarranted controversy"". the government spending on recognised madarsas, too, had gone up in the 23-year rule of the lf, from rs 5.20 lakh in 1976-77 to rs 115 crore in 2000-2001. however, while syllabi reforms would continue, the uniqueness of the madrasa system would be preserved, the leaders assured. ironically, controversy within the lf on relevance of the madarsas could not be concealed, as the statement observed, ""kerala, which has attained highest rate of literacy, has no madrasa system."" meanwhile, the state''s madrasa teachers association is not happy with bhattacharjee''s promise that his statement will not lead to victimisation of the madarsas. it wants action to that direction. on sunday, the association had a meeting here discussing the issues. the meeting preceded a crucial session of the association on monday which bhattacharjee would address where he was likely to clarify the state''s madrasa policy. ""a number of madrasa teachers were called by the police for questioning after his statement. they were let off, but what happens to their social prestige?"" asked association general secretary sk nurul haque.
