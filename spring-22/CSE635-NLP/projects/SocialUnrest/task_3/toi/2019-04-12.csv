0,Kols protest against shut ration shops,"badama: few in shankargarh and still fewer in allahabad knew about this village till recently. but the way the kols of badama broke their traditional silence against the denial of basic right to food has galvanised several sections. nearby villagers want to emulate them while the village pradhan and kotedar (pds franchisee) is trying to perusade them to withdraw the legal course they have taken. the smugness with which officials dismissed complaints of lack of food is almost gone. faced with the nagging problem of closed and empty pds shops, absent primary teachers, missing mid-day meals for their children and misrepresentation of their economic status, villagers of badama first decided to contest the panchayat elections under the aegis of shramik swayamsahayata samuh. â€˜â€˜the powerful patels spent a lot of money and won. reprisals followed. kerosene which was distributed once in a while also disappeared. â€˜â€˜we did not even know about the availability of wheat, rice and sugar while our ration cards showed we are getting them every month,â€™â€™ says rammilan of badama. at this point, sheeba jose, a lawyer from allahabad, visited badama and discovered that the basic problem was of total misrepresentation of villagers. â€˜â€˜very few of them had the card showing them to be below poverty line. even those who had red card under antyodya scheme got wheat at rs 2.50 per kilogram and rice at rs 3 per kilogram,â€™â€™ says jose. she decided to take up the matter legally, asked the villagers to give it in writing that the problems related to non-availability of food. affidavits along with copies of ration cards were prepared and a formal complaint was filed in the office of chief divisional officer. luckily it showed result, says a happy rammilan: â€˜â€˜the cdo immediately took action and now the village pradhan and kotedar is running after them (villagers) to take their quota of foodgrain. we have taken foodgrain but will not take back our complaint. they should pay for their past misdeeds.â€™â€™ last tuesday, as the news of badama spread in the public hearing on the right to food, hundreds of villagers took out their ration cards and rushed to jose who promised to turn more than 40 villages near shankargarh into other badamas.

2,ML bandh turns violent,"bettiah: the cpi (ml)-sponsored west champaran bandh, supported by cpi, congress, samata and bjp, turned ugly at bagaha on thursday where police fired six rounds in the air after resorting to lathicharge. bandh supporters reportedly snatched a police rifle, west champaran dm ravi parmar told tnn. however, while the dm did not confirm police firing at bagaha, the sp, amrendra kumar ambedkar, was â€œunavailableâ€� to this newspaper despite repeated attempts. eyewitnesses told times news network that local mla and state food minister purnamasi ram was moving around bagaha bazar with armed policemen asking the shop owners to open their shops. ml supporters enforcing the bandh reportedly became agitated by the ministerâ€™s movement with armed men. meanwhile, a bagaha court granted bail to bihar food and civil supplies minister purnamasi ram on thursday, after he surrendered before the court in a case related to assault of a cpi-ml leader, dayananad dwivedi, for naming him in an alleged rs 6100-crore red card scam. additional chief judicial magistrate u b mishra granted bail to ram after he agreed to execute a bond and two sureties of rs 2000 each.

3,Close fight likely in council polls,"patna: with the ruling rjd falling short of 11 votes to ensure the victory of its fifth candidate, the april 22 biennial polls to the 9 seats of the state legislative council is likely to witness a triangular contest among the rjd, lok janashakti party (ljp) and jd (u) candidates for one of nine seats. the bjp and samata party have already reached an understanding for the council polls regarding three seats. under the agreement, the samata party would give its seven surplus votes to the bjp while the latter agreed to give its surplus votes to the samata party nominees in the 2004 council polls. the samata party will field two nominees while the bjp will contest only one in the 2004 polls. national general secretary of samata party rajiv ranjan alias lallan singh while justifying the demand of party legislators for two seats in the ensuing polls, said on thursday that the agreement was final. when his attention was drawn towards the statement of deputy leader of the party in the assembly upendra kushwaha that the party legislators were unwilling to vote for the bjp nominees in the ensuing polls, singh said that kushwaha and other mlas were not aware of the agreement when they were talking to mediapersons. the bjp, having 36 members in the assembly is contesting for two seats. the rjd, which had initially planned to contest only four council seats and give one to its ally congress, made the poll interesting by deciding to contest five out of the nine seats and give one to the congress. since congress had extended support to the rjd in the rajya sabha, the latter is committed to return the compliment in the council polls by providing it the required votes. the failure of the jd (u) and ljp to reach an understanding over the polls has provided rjd national president laloo prasad yadav with the right opportunity to make a bid for the fifth council seat even as he had only 13 surplus votes. laloo would, it goes without saying, make a valiant bid for the ljp, jd (u) and a few independent votes as the fifth rjd nominees will need 11 more votes for safe passage to the council. a candidate would require about 24 votes in order to get elected. it may will go down further since the cpi (ml) having members in the assembly will boycott the polls as it is opposed to continuance of upper house. the seven member ljp appears to have succeeded in soliciting the support of a few jail birds. some of the jail birds figure among the proposers of ljp candidate vijay kumar sahni, newphew of ljp leader jai naraian nishad.

4,Police draft strict wedding hall rules,"pune: marriages may be made in heaven, but they seem to be giving puneites hell with the bursting of firecrackers and blaring music. the city police have therefore decided to crack the whip on marriage halls which allow wedding parties to burst crackers on their premises, play brass bands and use loud speakers for long hours. halls which do not provide parking space for their guests will also be pulled up henceforth, because the guest then fill up parking space around the hall and create traffic jams. puneites living near the 100-odd pmc-authorised marriage halls in the city, who have come to dread the wedding season, have the akhil bharatiya grahak panchayat (abgp) to thank for taking up the cause with the police. the city police on their part have drawn up several rules for wedding halls, the violation of which will attract stringent punishment. assistant commissioner of police (wanowrie) m.t. deshmukh recently convened a meeting of marriage hall-owners and warned them against non-compliance. deshmukh clarified that brass bands can be played briefly and without loudspeakers after obtaining permission from the police. electronic musical instruments and the bursting of crackers will not be allowed. owners who misuse allotted parking space, compelling guests to park elsewhere will henceforth be pulled up along with owners of these vehicles if neighbourhood residents approach the police, he said. ""i have asked owners of marriage halls not only to put up a board outlining these restrictions, but also ensuring that marriage parties comply,"" deshmukh told the times news network . he admitted that he had received numerous complaints from residents of localities along pune-satara road, which has a concentration of marriage halls. shubha gadkari, head of abgp''s south pune unit told tnn that a team of abgp activists surveyed wedding halls in the area and found that rules were being openly flouted. ""over 200 residents of the lic and state bank colonies near shivdarshan locality had been consistently submitting written complaints against three wedding halls since 1998, but no action was taken. all requests to owners of these halls fell on deaf ears prompting us to approach the grahak panchayat,"" she said. gadkari, who stays in the area, said residents had to put up with rowdy behaviour from wedding guests, many of whom were under the influence of alcohol. ""recently a cracker lit by a marriage party landed in the drawing room of a resident,"" gadkari recalls. hospitals and educational institutions too have had to put up with the nuisance, she says. ""two doctors, dr prakash seth and dr dhananjay joshi, were among the first to sign on a petition submitted to the parvati darshan police chowky last year,"" she added. while gadkari objected to marriage processions hogging the entire road width, acp deshmukh admitted that traffic police had a harrowing time managing traffic jams caused by these processions. deshmukh is now planning another meeting of marriage hall-owners from other parts of the city to inform them of the new regulations.

5,HC stays civic polls in ward 29,"patna: the patna high court on thursday stayed the election in the ward no. 29 of the patna municipal corporation (pmc). a single bench presided by justice r s garg stayed the election on the writ petition of a lawyer, shambhu prasad. prasad had challenged the rejection of his nomination papers filed for contesting the forthcoming urban bodiesâ€™ elections in the pmc as ward councillor. the deputy development commissioner-cum-returning officer of the pmc had rejected his nomination on the basis of a protest petition of a candidate, ashok yadav, who is contesting elections from this ward. yadav had argued that the lawyer, shambhu prasad, was an assistant public prosecutor (app) appointed by the state government and also a standing counsel of the central government. accordingly, his nomination should not be accepted, yadav argued. the returning officer accepted this view while rejecting the nomination of prasad. in his writ petition, prasad pleaded that under the provision of the pmc act, only the salaried staff of the state government could be debarred from contesting civic polls. his lawyer, tarakant jha, pleaded that the app or standing counsel got only fee for contesting government cases, not salary from the government. therefore, the rejection of nomination papers of prasad was illegal, jha said.

6,Trivial reasons sparked earlier riots,"ahmedabad: if it took a shocking massacre like godhra to trigger off massive communal riots in the state in the 21st century, history shows that trivial incidents caused most riots in the 20th century. an inquiry report prepared by justice vs dave of rajasthan high court, who headed a commission of inquiry to investigate the 1985 anti-reservation and subsequent communal riots, devotes a special chapter to the ''history of riots and agitations in gujarat''. tracing the riots way back from 1714, the report points out at the causes of riots as festivals and religious celebrations, aggressions and changing of the secular complex of the ''pols'', ''khanchas'' and ''by-lanes'' within the walled city due to migration to areas of greater security. on april 18, 1941, communal riots broke out and curfew imposed in most localities, was in force for two and a half months. as a result, the civil disobedience movement in the city engineered by the congress was suspended till october 1941. both communities suffered in varying degrees in ahmedabad and elsewhere in the state. tracing the records, the report observes an important consequence of the riots ""after this sad episode, the muslims of ahmedabad turned their faces and embraced the programme of the muslim league."" this was followed soon by the communal riots on july 1, 1946, during the rath yatra due to police firing. curfew was imposed. records suggest that the communal riots broke out at about 12.30 pm, in the sherkotda police station. one sikandar who was a well known muslim gymnast, accompanied by three or four members of his akhada was watching the performance of a hindu akhada which formed the part of a procession. sikandar allegedly criticised the style of wait-lifting adopted by one chitranjan chintamani. this led to a scuffle, in which sikandar and chintamani were injured; sikandar and some sadhus, both of whom were excited, were arrested and put in lock-up. this led to riots. this was followed by the 1958 riots and police firing at khadia. the then district magistrate had eloquently described khadia locality in connection with a firing on august 12, in the following words, ""the worst area was as it had invariably been in the previous disturbances, the khadia ward in ahmedabad city."" however, it will be wrong to believe that the communal tension has always been between hindus and muslims. in 1965, the city witnessed the first ever sikh-muslim riot in the city, when two sikh autorickshaw drivers were murdered by some muslims. on the following day during the funeral procession, some irate sikhs broke open some muslim shops and attacked them. the riots in 1969 have become a history by themselves. the report held ""...that there was never any riot in the state of gujarat of magnitude as was witnessed in september 1969, which took a heavy toll of human lives and property belonging to both the communities."" justice pj reddy commission which inquired into this riots found that at least 560 people died, while 561 were injured. these riots were sparked by a trivial incident on september 18, 1969, when a large number of people had gathered for ''urs'' of the bukhari saheb''s chhila. at about 3.45 pm when a herd of the cows accompanied by their keepers had almost reached the temple gates, some muslims objected as to why the sadhus of the temple had allowed animals to disturb the fair. an altercation followed between some muslims and the sadhus in which some sadhus were injured. incidents of violence, thereafter, happened in rapid succession in various parts of the city, taking a heavy toll of lives and property. this was followed by 1985 anti-reservation agitation which took the colour of communal riots and then in 1992 occurred post-babri riots.

13,BJP tells Modi to call elections in state,"panaji: gujarat chief minister narendra modiâ€™s offer to step down friday afternoon was unanimously rejected a few hours later by the bjp national executive. instead, it advised him â€˜â€˜to seek dissolution of the assembly, go to the people and seek their verdictâ€™â€™ as â€˜â€˜it is confident that modi can meet every challenge, that by effective action he can counter every canardâ€™â€™. party sources indicated that the assembly elections were likely to be called soon. in a three-page resolution, indicative of the partyâ€™s return to a hardline hindutva line, and the ascendancy of home minister lk advani, the national executive applauded the â€˜â€˜firmnessâ€™â€™ with which modi handled the godhra carnage and the riots that followed, somewhat at variance with what the pm said in gujarat on april 4. the resolution then said modi had resigned â€˜â€˜in the best traditions of the party...to assist the party in discussing the happenings in gujarat, and so that it may take a decision without any inhibitionsâ€™â€™. minutes before the bjpâ€™s scheduled public rally, party president k.jana krishnamurthy announced that modi had offered to quit and that the national executive would take a decision on it later in the evening. modi told krishnamurthy that since he had become the subject of a â€˜â€˜vicious propagandaâ€™â€™, he wanted to attend the national executive as an ordinary member rather than as a chief minister. later, sources said that union law minister arun jaitley, who had gone to ahmedabad to â€˜â€˜escortâ€™â€™ the cm to goa, was asked to suggest this line of action to him, in order to silence not just the few critics within the bjp but also all speculation regarding his resignation. modiâ€™s offer to step down may have followed demands from the opposition, and also from key nda allies such as the telugu desam party and the trinamul congress. there was also speculation that the prime minister was beginning to find him an embarrassment and a liability, after his recent visit to gujarat where vajpayee had said that the riots had made it difficult for him to show his face abroad. indeed, earlier in the evening, vajpayee made a strong pro-hindutva speech at the campal grounds. without naming modi, he said: â€˜â€˜look at the horrifying carnage on the sabarmati express in godhra. the tragedy after that â€” that, too, was condemnable. but we should not forget why the riots took place in gujarat. kisne aag jalane ka kaam kiya?â€™â€™ related stories:",panaji
14,CPM top brass gave order on arrest,"kolkata: the decision to arrest influential cpm leader of dum dum dulal banerjee was taken at the highest level of the state government and the cpm leadership, party insiders said on friday. according to sources, the police commissioner sent a report to the state home secretary on wednesday, where banerjee's involvement in the twin murder at neyarabagan in cossipur on march 4 was explained in detail. banerjee and his associates were also involved in large-scale extortion racket in the area, the report said. the home secretary sent the report to chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee. on thursday, bhattacharjee, in consultation with cpm state secretary anil biswas, decided that the police should take decisive steps. in the evening, biswas attended a meeting of the cossipore-belgachhia zonal committee of the cpm where he announced categorically that corruption among party members, however influential, would not be tolerated. our party has began a rectification campaign to weed out corruption from the organisation. all of you have participated in it. but how can some of you give speeches against corruption in meetings but indulge in corrupt practices yourselves? this can not be tolerated, biswas said. dulal banerjee was present in the meeting along with state committee member rajdeo goala, who has been the most vociferous against banerjee's arrest. a few hours after the meeting, detective department officials arrested banerjee. a few more arrests of prominent party leaders of the area would follow, insiders said. several kolkata district committee members of the party questioned, however, the motive behind banerjee's arrest and said he was a victim of a conspiracy. according to them, the party was deeply factionalised and all the groups were engaged in criminal activities. secretariat member rajdeo goala has come out in support of banerjee and has raised charges of police high-handedness. this is a left front ruled state. the police can not do whatever they want, goala fumed in public. alimuddin street bosses, however, are convinced that banerjee was indeed involved in extortion, corruption and even drug trafficking and the party was losing popular support largely because of the extortionist activities of banerjee and his supporters. a series of corruption and extortion charges against banerjee have been flooding the party for years.

15,Bangalore-Mysore railway line doubling ruled out,"mysore: southern railways general manager v. anand on thursday ruled out taking up line doubling work between bangalore and mysore in the present circumstances. however, he said doubling of line from bangalore till ramanagaram would be taken up soon. talking to reporters here on his first visit to mysore after taking over as the chief of the southern railways in january last, anand said doubling work from bangalore till kengeri would be completed this year. thanking the karnataka government for lending a helping hand to the railways in clearing encroachments and in acquiring land for doubling work, he said the work when complete would help commuters and students travelling from bangalore to the jnanabharati campus. talking about the hindrances for taking up line doubling work between bangalore and mysore, anand said, the economics of the project was not feasible and with the new concept of corporate-oriented economy it would not be possible for the railways to take up the project. anand said even the conversion of railway line between mysore and chamarajnagar was not feasible without planning a railway line linking sathyamanagalam and coimbatore with chamarajnagar. this year the ministry had earmarked rs 15 crore for gauge conversion work and he advised the construction department not to take up conversion as available funds would leave the work incomplete. he said he had instead directed the officials to strengthen or reconstruct the bridges and other points on this line so that it would help the railways in future when they get full steam into the conversion project. anand also said, southern railways was ready to provide the track and other facilities to the tourism department which had been entrusted the `palace on wheels'' project. delay in launching the project would be fault of agencies entrusted with the work and not the railways, he added. on introduction of high speed trains, anand said it was not possible to run high speed trains in the south. ``at the maximum, train speed can be increased to 140 km per hour and not to 300 or 400 km per hour as claimed by the ministry. ``however our tracks are in very good condition,''''he said, adding that the ministry had plans to launch fast trains on a trial basis between mumbai and ahmedabad and new delhi-kanpur via agra. anand said decline in freight movements due to economic slowdown had affected the railways income which in turn was preventing the authorities from taking up any people-oriented railway projects.

17,"Speed up testing of cotton hybrid, says minister","new delhi: union agriculture minister ajit singh wants the expert evaluation of mech-915, a genetically- engineered cotton seed, to be done in one year. the indian council of agricultural research had planned to do it in two years. the mech-915 strain is thought to be more suitable for northern states like punjab, haryana and rajasthan where a third of indiaâ€™s cotton is grown. the governmentâ€™s genetic engineering approval committee recently cleared three cotton hybridsâ€” mech 12, 162 and 184â€” after extensive icar-supervised field trials. but these were deemed suitable for growing in the west and south. mech-915 seeds were not approved since they had not been tested. reports that government red-tape had delayed their approval have irritated singh. the ministry says maharashtra hybrid seed co. ltd (mahyco), the firm for marketing these externally developed seeds in india, is yet to supply any for the mandatory tests. mahyco supplied the other three hybrid seeds for icar tests; these were done, at locations in the central and southern regions in 2000-01 and on a bigger scale in 2001-02. on going through the icar report, geac cleared these three hyrbrids late last month for controlled commercial issue, a three-year approval, with the threat of revocation if the stipulations are not adhered to. mahyco did not supply the icar with mech-915 seeds and the april 5 letter, from a.m.gokhale, the geac chairman, asks it to do so now, â€˜â€˜well in timeâ€™â€™. icar says it wishes to test for two seasons, at least. this makes ajit singh, who has to contend with impatient farmers and their political pressure, uneasy. so, he called the icar chief, panjab singh, on thursday and asked him to increase the number of locations for testing, to see if the results generated could be considered adequate in a year.

18,SC asks govt to ensure railway safety,"new delhi: close on the heels of imposing a ban on diesel buses in the capital, the supreme court has turned its attention to the safety of railway passengers. the apex court has asked the centre to ensure safety of about 13 million passengers travelling in 13,000 trains every day. â€˜â€˜there is no point in extending the lines for travelling without even securing the safety of the passengers who travel by the existing linesâ€™â€™, said a bench of justice g b pattanaik, justice k g balakrishnan and justice brijesh kumar. the court was hearing a public interest petition filed by hd shourie, director of voluntary organisation, common cause. â€˜â€˜it appears that only the finances stand in the way of implementing several expert committee reports on safety. the lack of resources cannot be a ground to avoid safety in railway travelâ€™â€™, the bench said, adding it would consider relevant material before ordering different safety levels for passengers in a phased manner. the court asked solicitor general salve about the expenditure the railway administration would be incurring on safety measures. it also inquired about the new lines which the railway administration proposed to lay and how much money was required for the same.

19,4 killed in separate fire incidents,"new delhi: four people, including three children, were killed in two separate incidents of fire which broke out in delhi on thursday night. both incidents took place in the slum clusters. according to the police, two brothers, aged five and two years, and their four-year-old sister, were killed when their hutment in shakarpur pushta slums in east delhi caught fire. the children were asleep when the fire broke out. according to the police, the childrenâ€™s father, ramesh, was the first to realise that their house was on fire. he reportedly rushed out with his four-year-old daughter reema. however, the fire prevented him from returning and rescuing his other three children. ramesh and reema sustained 30 per cent injuries. his wife, seema, also managed to escape. though the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, officials suspect that high tension wires which run overhead may have sparked it off. â€˜â€˜the hutments are made of straw and plastic sheets. it is possible that sparking in the overhead wires may have started the fire,â€™â€™ said a police officer. the fire spread to 50 hutments and it took eight fire tenders to control the fire. the fire was doused in half an hour. the shakarpur police have registered a case and an sdm inquiry has also been ordered. a 40-year-old man was burnt to death in the second fire that broke out in kanchanpuri slums, in ip estate. the fire destroyed about 1,000 hutments. fifteen tenders were pressed into service and it took fire fighters over an hour to douse the flames. according to the fire fighters, narrow lanes in the slum cluster prevented tenders from getting close to the fire.
