1,Gupta wants pro-active policy against militants,"jammu: setting up a doda scouts (comprising locals from the district) on the pattern of ladakh scouts, strengthening the security grid by giving better firepower to the locals and launching a sustained offensive against the militants can ensure that massacres, like in doda, are not repeated, according to union minister of state for civil aviation chaman lal gupta. he blamed the state government for the massacre, saying the withdrawal of the itbp troops from the area for redeployment encouraged the militants to strike. asked about the rationale behind his demand for doda scouts, gupta said: ""the locals know the terrain much better than the police, paramilitary or even the army. their sense of belonging and knowledge about local conditions makes them ideal for taking on the militants."" incidentally, gupta represents the udhampur-doda parliamentary constituency where the militants have carried out hundreds of killings over the last few years. he said: ""pakistan and its lackeys do not understand the language of reconciliation. it is only by adopting an aggressive pro-active policy that we can force the militants on the run. he said, ""a four-tiered security structure is being followed in the trouble-torn areas. it comprises the village defence committees (vdcs) at level one, special police officers (spos) at level two, police personnel at level three and paramilitary or army personnel at level four. however, all these levels are defensive in nature. ""we need to keep these things in place, strengthen them but simultaneously activate strike troops like special task force (stf) and rashtriya rifles. they should launch an all-out offensive."" asked about the state of vdcs in doda, gupta said: ""things are better because more spos, having better weapons like ak-47 rifles, have been attached with the vdcs. however, more vdcs need to be set up in the remotest parts or the villagers should be armed even otherwise for their defence."" he said members of several vdcs have now demanded that they be attached to the nearest army deployments and not the police. he said poor villagers in remote areas live in dhoks (temporary shelters constructed in the high-altitude meadows) and there are at least 15 to 16 such large settlements in doda alone. since the presence of security personnel in adjacent areas has been scaled down, these people are now vulnerable to militant attacks. gupta's proposal * set up doda scouts comprising local people * give local people more weapons for self-defence * security forces should launch all-out offensive against militants

""much before india became part of the wto regimen, indian sky was fully invaded,"" explained the source. however, in what can be seen as a signal of sorts for fdi entry, the ministry has clarified that under the companies act, 1956, as soon as foreign companies incorporated abroad are registered in india, they are subject to indian rules and regulations. there are more than 1,700 companies incorporated abroad and registered in india with the registrar of companies.

5,Rising suicides a cause for concern,"new delhi: sharp increase in cases of suicide in the country for the last five years, is causing concern among social scientists. experts and psychiatrists feel that nothing much has been done to generate public awareness and to raise the morale of people who find themselves caught in various social, occupational and economical problems. that is why the trend continues and the number of suicides is increasing day by day, calling for a joint effort by government agencies and private institutions to arrest the trend. the data available with the national crime records bureau (ncrb) shows that number of suicides reported from all over the country jumped from 89,178 in 1995 to 110,587 in 1999. kerala has the highest suicide ratio when compared to population, while west bengal has registered the highest number of 13,889 suicides in the country in 1999. other states, where the reported suicides crossed the 10,000 figure in 1999 are maharashtra (13,591), karnataka (12,481), tamil nadu (11,448), and andhra pradesh (10,386). in the capital city, the trend in higher among women, the reported female suicidal deaths has increased from 348 in 1995 to 445 in 1999. family disputes accounted for suicides of 75 women of the national capital in 1995 which rose to 176 in 1999. according to ncrb, in 99.9 per cent cases the main cause is illness, while family problems cause 20 per cent of the suicides. similarly, love affairs (3.4 per cent), poverty (2.4 per cent) and dowry (2.3 per cent) are among the 22 main causes which force people to take this extreme step while in 19.5 per cent cases, the reasons remain unspecified. with the rising number of suicides, government as well as private and voluntary organisations are offering their counselling services to potential victims. ""one such voluntary association is befrienders india, which started functioning in 1992,"" said usha kala, secretary of befrienders india and director of its member centre sumaitri in delhi. ""people can call us or meet us at our centres and we believe in one-to-one talk where the individual can share his feelings freely,"" she said. kala explained the aim of her association, ""befriending is the offering of a friendship and concern by one ordinary human being to another at a time of crisis or loneliness and in this way we provide them opportunity to share their problems with us."" ""we don't believe in giving advices as we deal with the persons and not just the problems and help them find the solution themselves by providing a clear perspective because problems remain there and the person himself has to cope with it,"" said usha kala. the association has 10 member centres in delhi-sumaitri, chennai, mumbai, pondicherry, secunderabad, kochi, ahmedabad, kolkata and thrissur. another private counsellor of preet vihar area in east delhi r.k. suri says, ""the feeling to commit suicide comes in anybody's mind just for some seconds and at that time if the person gets emotional support, he can overcome the suicidal thoughts."" the trend is not uncommon among children, as views mohd khalid of childline, government-run counselling service, ""i have received many calls where children show their intentions to commit suicide. children are generally affected by the education pressure and family problems, like, if they have any problem with the father or the mother."" ""with the industrialisation process, break up of the joint family and living under great pressure, people are less able to cope with the pressure. living in a metropolitan city increase the incidence of loneliness, isolation, competitiveness, work pressure and interpersonal problems,"" says dr vijay gupta, a psychiatrist of south delhi. when the pressure becomes intolerable, individuals turn to inappropriate and destructive solutions. they become alcoholics, take to drugs or suffer from mental illness, dr gupta said, adding the lack of appropriate and timely emotional support also contributed to an increase in the number of emotional crises. giving the reason of increasing number of suicides, dr sanjay chugh, another psychiatrist said, ""underreported cases of suicides have decreased as now the cases are reported more. but the rate of suicide has also increased."" highlighting the causes leading to suicide, he said, ""unhealthy social relations, occupational, economic and social problems force people to take this extreme step. the agony of the people also escalates when they can't get their family's and society's support."" ""in the absence of any kind of support, people get trapped in the feelings of helplessness, and worthlessness and think like an atheist. they start thinking 'jine se to marna achcha' (better die than live),"" dr chugh said. stressing the fact that society does play an important role for the distressed, he said ""these pessimistic feelings arise when people cannot get social support. so with the presence of social support the number of cases will definitely slow down."" expressing his helplessness in curbing this trend, dcp (crime), m.s. upadhyaya said, ""police can only handle abortive suicide attempts. but what can we do with dead people who have killed themselves."" expressing his disagreement with the practice of registering attempt-to-suicide-case against people who make attempts to commit suicide, dr chugh said ""i don't favour the law where people, who could not succeed in committing suicide, are charged, thereby increasing the problems faced by them."" ""the one way to bring down the increasing trend of suicide is a well-laid social policy that will take off the crushing tension of the individual through a system of social security by creating more jobs and a better living environment,"" dr chugh said.",new delhi

10,Bihar govt unlikely to implement Irani panel report: Modi,"patna: the leader of opposition in the state assembly sushil kumar modi, while appreciating the report of industrial commission submitted by its chairman j j irani to bihar chief minister rabri devi on saturday, said that there was little likelihood of the state government implementing its recommendations as it appeared quite unwilling to improve the law and order situation to create an atmosphere conducive to investment in the state. apart from that, modi said on monday, the bihar government was yet to announce its industrial policy. he said that a state government which was yet to announce its industrial policy could not be expected to implement the recommendations made by irani panel. modi said the rabri government had not even bothered to extend the term of the industrial policy announced by it in 1995 which lapsed in august last year. he said the file proposing extension to the 1995 policy till the announcement of the new industrial policy was pending at the level of cm for last one year. he said that even the 1995 policy could never be implemented as the departments concerned with its implementation, including revenue and land reforms, commercial taxes and energy failed to issue the matching notifications. modi said that while the commission had maintained that no industrialist would like to invest in bihar unless there was a substantial improvement in law and order situation, rjd national president laloo prasad yadav refused to accept that law and order was in a very bad shape in the state. he said that though the government had announced the constitution of a high level committee headed by chief secretary mukund prasad to study the report of the industrial commission and suggest ways for implementing its recommendation, neither prasad nor other members of the the committee, including the development commissioner, finance commissioner and chairman of bihar state electricity board (bseb) were present when irani submitted his report to the cm. the opposition leader said that similar fate awaited the report of bihar state finance commission headed by dr s c jha. modi said that jha, in the introduction of his report, had said that state government failed in its obligation to appoint a member and member secretary of the commission and providing it with other required facilities, including secretariat facility for its proper functioning. modi said that jha had maintained that the commission functioned under great constraints and he had to visit different offices of the government and institutions to hold discussions and gather information like a research scholar. he said that jha had to wait for three days to get an appointment with the cm to submit his interim report. he added that the infrastructure commission, headed former union minister d p yadav, was yet to start its work for want of facilities.
