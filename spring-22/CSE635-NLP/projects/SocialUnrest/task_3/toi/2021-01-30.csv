0,Don't arrest Maya in Taj scam: Govt to CBI,"NEW DELHI: The government had ""advised"" the CBI not to move on arresting former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati in the multi-crore Taj Heritage Corridor scam case until the forthcoming elections were over, highly placed sources said.

The CBI is supposed to move the Supreme Court challenging Allahabad High Court''s order restraining it from arresting the BSP leader.

""The government has decided that it won''t be proper for the CBI to seek an Opposition leader''s arrest just before the elections. This would send the wrong signals in a democracy,"" sources said.

The government sought Law Minister Arun Jaitley and Attorney General Soli Sorabjee''s opinion on the issue.

""Both Jaitley and Sorabjee opined against moving the apex court. They felt it would be better if the agency moved the High Court seeking a revision of its October 22 order,"" they said.

The High Court had restrained the CBI from arresting her in the Rs 175-crore Taj Heritage Corridor scam case and the disproportionate assets case till the conclusion of the investigations.

2,Modi vindictive towards farmers: Keshubhai tells PM,"AHMEDABAD: Former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, who is also a member of Rajya Sabha from Gujarat, has written a letter to Prime Minister Vajpayee about the state governmentâ€™s anti-farmer stance.

Patel has urged the PM to intervene in the matter before it was too late. The senior BJP leader stated that the government had not paid the dues of crop insurance scheme to the farmers, despite several representations made by farmers bodies.

Meanwhile, the indefinite fast undertaken by veteran RSS leader Laljibhai Patel over the power tariff hike entered the 10th day with no solution in sight.

It is learnt that a group of BJP MPs on Friday met the prime minister and apprised him about the serious situation arising out of the fastunto-death by the RSS leader. The members reportedly told Vajpayee that if the issue is not solved, it would adversely affect BJP prospects in the Lok Sabha polls.

5,Row over selection of lecturers by Pbi varsity,"PATIALA: Selection of two lecturers in the department of biotechnology of the Punjabi University has put a question mark on the selection process of the university.

It is being alleged that both the selections had been made by throwing rules and regulations to the wind and that the selected candidates had applied for the posts after the given schedule. On the other hand, university spokesman Baldev Singh Sandhu refuted the charges saying that the selections had been made fairly on merit basis and no rule or regulation had been ignored.

According to information available, these posts were advertised in April last year and after scrutiny some selected candidates were called for interview on December 2 last year which was postponed due to unknown reasons and rescheduled for January 5 this year. Almost all the candidates called for interview were only Ph.D. However many of the applicants were National Eligibility Test (NET) qualified and some were even double NET qualified but were not called for interview for not having completed their Ph.D. This test is conducted by the UGC and CSIR jointly for science subjects.

As per the UGC guidelines, the only requirement for appointment as lecturer used to be NET, but because of certain court cases and recommendations, the requirement of NET was relaxed for Ph.D holders. Thus NET or Ph.D were fixed as the minimum requirement for the posts of lecturer.

But as per the university instructions provided along with the application forms, first preference was fixed for the persons who are NET qualified and holding Ph.D while the second preference was for persons who are NET qualified. Persons who have submitted thesis for Ph.D on or before December 31, 2002 or M.Phil on or before December 31, 2003 were the third preference of the university, disclosed a candidate Satwinder Singh Dhillon, adding that as per university rules, the NET qualified persons were more preferred to than Ph.D holders. But in this case rules had been violated.

He said that the University had issued the appointment letters and recruited two such persons who were simply Ph.D and had not cleared the NET. Besides, the selected candidates had submitted their applications after postponement of the interview in December last and one of them had submitted her application just three days before the rescheduled interview day, he added.

7,Cell cos smile as polls near,"PUNE: R u free 2nite? Mobile phones and SMS have given rise to a new vocabulary among the young, the bold and the beautiful.

Perhaps, a new set of grammar could now be born through the grassroot political workers, who are set to use mobile phones in a big way in the coming weeks.

Given the instant connectivity provided by mobiles, the Congress city unit has gone ahead and booked a staggering 5,000 pre-paid cards of Rs 200 each from BSNL to be used in the election campaign.

Other mobile companies in Pune, such as Idea and Airtel, also expect a temporary surge in demand for pre-paid connections.

""Political parties will require these services for a month or six weeks, so there is likely to be a rise in the sale of pre-paid cards,"" explained Vijay Grover, chief operating officer (Maharashtra and Goa circle), Idea.

According to city Congress president Mohan Joshi, ""accessibility, mobility and faster campaigning,"" are the virtues of the mobile phone.

Joshi, however, hastily added that the Rs 10 lakh investment was made ""by individual party workers themselves"".

BSNL deputy general manager (business and marketing) Sunil Kumar told TNN that the Congress has already picked up 1,500 connections.

Joshi said the party was intent on using mobiles and e-mail to help the rank and file stay in touch with each other and also contact voters.

""Most of our party workers will use SMS to keep in touch with each other,"" said Pradeep Deshmukh, city president of Nationalist Congress Partyâ€™s student wing.

He said that during the recent party workersâ€™ meet in Pune, around 25-30 top leaders of the party sent out around 300 chain SMS each to party workers spread across the state, asking them to attend the meet.

8,"Show me the money, minister","NEW DELHI: Railway Minister Nitish Kumar has not put his cash where his mouth is. The Remote Area Rail Sampark Yojna, the centrepiece of his interim budget, seems to be just a well-packaged election promise.

The Railways, Kumar admitted, just cannot afford Rs 43,000 crore to implement over 230 approved projects languishing for years. In the next five years, the Railways can at best mobilise Rs 23,000 crore for these projects. Where then would the money come from?

Kumar has not given a viable answer. He has proposed to take up construction of new lines, gauge conversion, doubling and electrification through ""an additional outlay of Rs 20,000 crore"".

The interim budget does not provide any money towards this, admitted Railway Board chairman R P Singh.

Resources would remain a question mark even if the new government after the elections shows the same political commitment to complete these projects in backward areas, many of which are commercially not viable.

However, the interim budget shows a distinct improvement in railway finances since the battering it took in 1998 following the implementation of staff pay and pension hike at the behest of the Fifth Pay Commission.

""The railway finances can, however, ill-afford political consideration weighing heavier over commercial prudence in deciding on which projects to take up,"" said a former Railway Board official.

The operational efficiency has not improved this year, although Kumar has claimed that it turned out to be better than what he had anticipated in the 2003-04 budget estimates. For earning every rupee, the Railways had to spend 92.3 paise in 2002-03.

In 2003-04, they actually spent 92.6 paise, although this year''s budget had estimated the spending at 94.1 paise. Since 1998-99, the operating ratio has remained in the 90s.

The profitability of the Railways, as measured by the ratio of net revenue to the capital at charge and investment from capital fund, has shown no particular improvement this year at 7.1 per cent compared to 7.5 per cent last year.

It is thus clear that the Railways'' capacity to generate internal resources for funding network development remains limited.

This is reflected in the annual plan for 2004-05, the size of which has been kept tentatively at Rs 13,425 crore against Rs 12,918 crore in this year''s budget which actually was raised to Rs 13,918 crore by adding the Rs 1,000-crore Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla new line.

There are, however, some encouraging signs. The Railways is not only poised to meet the target of 540 million tonnes in revenue earning freight this year, but have now set their eyes on meeting an enhanced target of 550 million tonnes.

In passenger traffic too, there has been a growth of 2.8 per cent this year.

But the trend of earnings has not matched expectations. The revised estimates for 2003-04 thus show Rs 890 crore less in gross traffic receipts.

In the interim budget for 2004-05, gross traffic receipts have been pegged at Rs 1,877 crore more than the revised estimates of this year. Since no additional revenue mop-up is proposed, the markmanship in these estimates remains to be proved.

9,Pawar avoids Sonia's rally,"MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar has expressed his inability to be present and share the platform with Congress president Sonia Gandhi at Digras rally on Saturday.

The rally was expected to see the two leaders launch the Congress-NCP election campaign, from Digras in Yavatmal district in Vidarbha.

Congress leaders had thought of it as beginning a new chapter in the Congress-NCP relations, in view of the ensuing elections.

The rally, of Banjaras, is being organised by All India Banjara Seva Sangh on completing 50 years of service. They''d invited Pawar and Sonia to attend the rally. Pawar''s name was printed on the invitation issued by the organisation.

However, Pawar said he has prior appointments and functions in his home constituency of Baramati in Pune district. NCP state president RR Patil said Pawar wanted to attend the rally. But he was unable to, because of prior commitments.

Political observers feel Pawar would have cancelled his local programmes if he really wanted to attend the Digras rally. It appears he is not in a rush to politically embrace the Congress.

He would it is felt, like to finalise the alliance details before sharing a platform. Apart from a battle to keep the party poll symbol, Pawar is faced with another urgent issue: whether to hold simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and assembly in Maharashtra as demanded by the Congress.

So far, the NCP has not given a green signal for simultaneous elections.

State Congress spokesman Rohidas Patil has announced the central leadership would take a final decision within a day or two.

10,Seven hurt in union clash,"THANE: A union rivalry took a violent turn on Friday at the Vidyut Metallic Company, a leading shaving blade manufacturing unit here, as workers belonging to the internal union hurled stones at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders Jeetendra Awhad and Sachin Aher,who were representing eight suspended workers.

Seven persons, including Mr Awhad''s bodyguard, were injured. Trouble started when both NCP leaders arrived at the factory''s premises. As the gate was closed, some of their followers climbed over.

Workers inside the premises started raining stones on the intruders. Once the gate was opened, it was a free for all.

Eyewitnesses saw at least six to seven workers, including a policeman, profusely bleeding and who had to be helped to a hospital.

The stone-pelting went on for almost an hour and the police had to resort to a lathicharge to stop it. The company has a track record of violent union rivalries.

""We have already deployed an SRP platoon outside the company gate. I have asked the concerned union leaders to avoid any provocation that may affect the peace,"" said deputy commissioner of police Kiran Shelar.

The violence was a fallout of trouble brewing since last Diwali. Eight workers were suspended by the management allegedly at the behest of the internal union.

The union had earlier collected Rs 500 each from the workers as subscription. This amount was deducted from their bonus directly and the eight workers had protested, hence their suspension. The NCP leaders had taken up the suspended workers'' cause.

On Friday, at Mr Awhad''s office, the company''s personnel officer, C.K. Poojarey, finally agreed to Mr Awhad''s demand to reinstate the eight workers. Celebrating this victory, the NCP leaders and their supporters marched towards the company when they were welcomed by stones.

The police have registered cross complaints and arrested six persons.

11,"Justice Jha bids adieu to lawyers, staff","PATNA: Justice S N Jha of the Patna High Court, who has been made the new chief justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, met the lawyers of the HC here on Friday.

Justice Jha also met HC secretariat staff, peshkars and other court officials and staff in their respective offices in a goodwill gesture.

He would leave Patna shortly for Jammu and Kashmir to take the oath of office of chief justice there.

He began his legal career as an advocate at Muzaffarpur.

Thereafter, he shifted to the Patna High Court and worked as the junior of senior advocate Tarakant Jha. There was no looking back after that.

He was later made a judge of the Patna HC. Justice Jha had passed important orders and verdicts in the animal husbandry scam case, which is being investigated by the CBI.

It was a pleasant surprise to many in the corridors of HC and offices of HC secretariat when Justice Jha, escorted by his secretary and some lawyers, met the lawyers and staff.

He told them, ""I am going to leave this place for Jammu and Kashmir; so, I have come to meet you.""

12,Business slows after latest arrests,"MUMBAI: The mood is tense at the controversial Sara Shopping Complex at Crawford Market. It''s evident from the first reaction of a shop owner to this reporter''s queries.

""Ma''am, are you from the income-tax department or the police?"" asks a worried-looking man. Journalists aren''t welcome at this complex either; on the contrary they''re viewed with equal suspicion.

""We don''t want any more publicity. Too much news is bad news for us,"" says Yakub Sorathia, who sells imported cellphones.

His fears are not unfounded. Business has been slow since Tuesday afternoon, after news about the arrests of three BMC officials filtered in. ""Business was similarly affected for a few days in March last year when the Mumbai police started probing the Dawood-connection in the shopping complex,"" says Yakubbhai.

Situated right across the road from the Mumbai police commissionarate in south Mumbai, the one-storey complex has become popular among those looking for smuggled goods. It has existed for five years. It may not have the swank of Heera Panna at Haji Ali, but it''s a magnet for gizmo freaks.

On a week day, approximately 500 people visit the shopping complex, which has around 370 shops. The number swells significantly on weekends and holidays.

An amazing array of the latest imported and â€˜Made in China'' gizmos are on display here. Everything, from monkeywash jeans to perfumes, chandeliers to spycams, is on sale.

The latest Nokia 6600 handset with an inbuilt camera is available here for Rs 4,500 â€” much less than the market price.

""Whenever I want to upgrade my handset, I come here. I always get a good buy,"" says regular customer Kaushik Rana.

That explains how the shopping centre has managed to thrive despite stiff competition from Manish market, another paradise for smuggled goods that is situated behind.

Contrary to popular perception, the shopping centre is not dominated by traders from the minority community. There is an equal number from the Marwari, Gujarati and Sindhi communities.

Right now, however, these shop owners'' main concern is that the illegal structure may be demolished by the civic authorities, leaving them without a source of livelihood.

""At least 20,000 people would be financially hit if and when the civic authorities decide to raze the structure,"" says another shop owner Yusuf Patel.

He wonders why the authorities have been targeting them. ""We have relevant papers to prove that we are the legal occupants of our shops. We have no connection with Dawood. So why are we being hounded?"" asks Yusufbhai.

Haryana Pradesh Congress (I) President and Former Chief Minister Haryana while addressing the Congress Sewa Dal Workers at State level convention here on Saturday afternoon stated that the purpose of Chief Minister Haryana Mr Om Parkash Chautala to call Assembly Session on 9th February is to clear the deck for holding election in the state simultaneously with Lok Sabha elections.

He said that if the elections were to be held next year then the Chief Minister could have called the session in the month of March because there was no need to pre pone the Assembly session.

Bhajan Lal lashed out at Mr Chautala and Mr Bansi Lal for not giving justice to the people of the state for the last 8 years. He said that the people are fed up with the policies of both the leaders.

He also criticized Bhartiya Janta Party for creating caste politics in a secular country like India. He appreciated the role of Sewa Dal in countryâ€™s freedom struggle. He said that the workers of this organization are disciplined and well organized. He said that Sewa Dal contributed maximum in the recent Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab election. He appealed to the workers of the Sewa Dal to prepare themselves for the next Lok Sabha election.

He said that RSS was born in 1925 and there is no comparison between the two. He said that the Sewa Dal workers are dedicated, discipline and wedded to the policies of the Congress. Mr Prahlad Yadav Chief Organiser of the Sewa Dal said that the workers of Sewa Dal would work whole heartedly in the next Lok Sabha election.

Mr Subhash Chaudhary Chairman of Sewa Dal of Haryana and Former State Minister while addressing the workers said that out of 19 districts in the state Sewa Dal camps have been organized in 12 district. Mr Raj Kumar Tyagi Yamuna Nagar District Congress (I) President Urban and Mr Lehri Singh DCC President Rural also spoke on the occasion.

Later on while addressing the press conference Bhajan Lal made it clear that there is no need of alliance in Haryana. He said that if at all the party high command desires to have alliance with any political party then the state unit will obey the order. On asked that all 20 sitting Congress MLAâ€™s would be given ticket, state President said that it is not mandatory to give tickets to all.

He said that if party high command desire that he should contest Lok Sabha election then he is prepared for that. He said that Congress would win all the ten Parliaments seats in Haryana because the present combination of INLD and BJP has been exposed.

When the newsman pointed out that there is bickering in Congress (I), Bhajan Lal denied and said that all are united and their undisputed leader is Mrs. Sonia Gandhi. He welcomed Mrs. Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi for joining the main stream of the party, which would strengthen the base in a country.

Former Chief Minister stated that during Lok Sabha and Assembly elections proper representation would be given to the women and youth. Bhajan Lal refused to comment on Bhupinder Singh Hooda dowry case. He said that it is a family affair and it is not proper to speak on anybodyâ€™s personal life.

He announced that if Congress comes to power then all the irrelevant taxes would be waived off.

14,CM stresses on increasing awareness about cancer,"KOCHI: A state-of-the-art cancer institute of the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) was inaugurated here on Saturday by Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony, who called for increasing awareness about the disease as more cases were being reported from the state.

Antony said more than the cure, stress should be on the preventive aspects of the disease.

New diseases and some which had been eradicated were again surfacing in Kerala and in other parts of the country, he said.

The maximum number of cancer patients were being reported from Malbar region, he said, adding that government hospitals had certain limitations in providing the best treatment facilities. The role of private hospitals and institutions in this regard was commendable, he said.

Praising the Amrita institute, Antony quipped ""sometimes I keep quiet. But when I speak out, I speak the truth.""

In his presidential address, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Dr Anil Kakodkar, stressed the need to make cancer treatment affordable to all, particulary those in rural areas.

The equipment for treating cancer is expensive and there was a need to develop ways and means to make the treatment affordable to all. The development of low cost equipment for cancer care and linkages of cancer institutions through telemedicine was also essential, he added.
