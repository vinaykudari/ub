1,Bypolls an acid test for all,"lucknow: the may 31 bypolls to one parliamentary and three assembly seats in uttar pradesh will provide the two political formulations, the bsp-bjp combine and samajwadi party-led front-- a platform to test their respective strength in uttar pradesh. these elections, being held in the backdrop of godhra incidents and communal flare-ups in gujarat, assume special significance for both-- the votaries of the hindutwa forces and the secular groupings. of the four seats, the bypoll to akbarpur lok sabha seat will be crucial for both the groups, mulayam-led people''s front and bsp-bjp combine. the bjp-vhp combine''s ayodhya programme and the government''s handling of the situation is likely to cast its shadow on these polls . mayawati, whose installation for the third time as chief minister of uttar pradesh with the help of bjp is a matter of days, will like to demonstrate her clout with the electorate. she had won the akbarpur lok sabha seat during the last parliamentary elections with a comfortable margin. mayawati vacated the akbarpur seat to send in the message across the state that her coronation was imminent. after being elected to uttar pradesh vidhan sabha from two assembly constituencies, harora and jehangirganj, mayawati also quit jehangirganj seat to retain harora, from where she won by an impressive margin. mayawati had won the jehangirganj seat by a small margin of 6,403 votes. however, much would depend whether the bsp contests these seats in alliance with the bjp or prefers to go alone. the contest for the debai seat, won by the rastriya kranti party chief kalyan singh, would be interesting. the rkp chief, who had won from two seats, atrauli, his old citadel, and debai, would like to retain debai to prove his mettle in western uttar pradesh. kalyan has won the atrauli seat in aligarh district for a record number of times. if political grapevine is to be believed, kalyan''s son is likely to stake his claim from debai. kalyan singh had won this seat by a margin of over 27,000 votes. besides, the contest for the baheri vidhan sabha constituency would be crucial for samajwadi party president mulayam singh yadav. the bypoll to this seat is being held following the death of manjur ahmad, the samajwadi party mla from baheri. ahmad was murdered while he was on a dharna outside raj bhawan recently.

5,Modi dares Sonia to contest polls in Gujarat,"ahmedabad: chief minister narendra modi on saturday launched a blistering attack on the congress leaders for raising hue and cry over gujarat riots and seeking his resignation while in fact the godhra train massacre was a conspiracy masterminded by the local congress leaders. addressing a function in saurashtra, modi said that it was really shocking that the party has stalled the proceedings of parliament and holding the nation to ransom for the past few days. he dared congress president sonia gandhi to contest election in gujarat where the party''s campaign against him has failed to evoke any response from the people. prime minister atal bihari vajpayee has even turned down the demand for his removal as such decision can be taken only by bjp legislators and the people of the state who have already thrown their weight in his favour. he cautioned that any attempt to wreak havoc on this issue could prove disastrous and such designs would not succeed. those who are trying to malign gujarat would be exposed as such canard could not last long. referring to the call for examination boycott given by gpcc leaders, modi said ""this was one more conspiracy of the congress party to continue disturbances in the state but the students have foiled their plan and preferred examinations"". while making a mention about a statement made by shahi imam bukhari of jama masjid, delhi, that ""we will cut the country in pieces"", modi asked why the so-called secular elements did not react to this.
