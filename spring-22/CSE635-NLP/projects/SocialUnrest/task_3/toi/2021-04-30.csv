0,EVMs: A tool to ensure 'farmaans' compliance,"BANDA: Dacoit gangs are issuing farmaans (orders) in favour of their candidates. Ironically, the electronic voting machines (EVM) meant to root out rigging, would be responsible for forcing villagers into voting for candidates favoured by these dacoits.

With a separate EVM for each booth in a constituency, the exact number of votes polled by a certain candidate would be known to all after the counting.

The candidate will be able to gauge the support extended to him by each village and whether farmaans have been followed or not. Once these dacoits realize that their orders have been violated, they would become vindictive.

This would lead to dreadful repercussions and ugly reprisals. Villagers here have decided to follow the farmaan. A few defiant ones have been advised not to endanger their life and vote according to wishes of the powerful. The EVMs have, in the name of technology, undone one of the most important changes introduced by Seshan.

In the orthodox ballot box system, ballot papers of all the booths of a Vidhan Sabha constituency were mixed together, a legacy of Seshan, before randomly making bundles of 1000 each for counting. This ensured secrecy of the vote, as it was not possible to judge how many votes were polled in whose favour from which booth. But now EVM gives exact distribution of votes polled at each booth. Moreover this is public information and hence everyone gets to know about it. Election Commission would have to take serious measures to ensure the secrecy of vote at any particular booth, more so because politics is increasingly being infected with vindictiveness.

Severe problems are anticipated in the Chitrakoot region, where the writ of dreaded gangs of Dadua and Thokia runs large. The police had made tall claims a fortnight ago that no farmaans would be issued by the dacoit gangs during the Lok Sabha elections. But Dadua gang and Thokia gang have issued farmaans in favour of the SP candidate from Banda-Chitrakoot Lok Sabha constituency, Shyam Charan Gupta. Recently Dadua''s brother has joined Samajwadi Party too.

Though SP Chitrakoot, Raghuvir Lal rejects any such farmaan outrightly, newspapers, villagers and locals seem to think otherwise. Come May 13, the truth will be out.

2,Senior citizens rue degradation in politics,"BHAGALPUR: The elderly no longer seem interested in polls and politicians in the silk city.

During a random survey, this correspondent found that voters, mostly aged, were completely disillusioned.

The senior citizens just do not want to bear the ordeal of standing in long queues at polling booths, once again, to elect indifferent and corrupt representatives.

Narmadeshwar Singh, a retired State Food Corporation (SFC) official candidly termed the present politicians â€œgreedy and over ambitiousâ€� with absolutely no respect for their valuable voters once the elections are over. Singh laments, â€œEarlier the contestants used to interact with their electorate, meet their family members and attended to their problems. But now, they show their hurry in campaigning and appear to be least concerned about the voters.â€�

Corroborating Singhâ€™s views, Mohammad Nizamuddin, a septuagenarian transporter of the Khiri Bandh locality said, â€œThe sense of sacrifice and will to serve people, common in those times, has completely vanished away now.

At present candidates have their eyes set on the hefty perks that they get after being electedâ€�.

He also said that the standard of campaigning has drastically come down compared to four decades back.

Another senior citizen, Shashi Prabha Sinha, a retired teacher of S M college seemed completely foxed with this pre-poll scenario. She said, â€œI am neither satisfied with the present politicians nor see any ray of hope in them.â€�

5,14 Punjab ministers on razor's edge,"NEW DELHI: In Punjab, wracked as the government is by factional politics that have seen CM Amarinder Singh having to accept his rival Rajinder Kaur Bhattal as his deputy, 14 ministers will be shown the door.

Not an easy task, considering that the CM has just about been able to buy a tenuous peace with the dissidents.

The North-East has seen some of the most infamous instances of political horse-trading and governments have tended to have brief tenures, usually falling to power intrigues and suitcase politics.

Manipur''s ministerial size is 58 per cent of the state assembly: 21 ministers will have to go.

The Meghalaya government will have to shed 16 ministers if the current size of the ministry - 46 per cent iof the legislature''s strength - is to keep to prescribed norms.

And the Nagaland ministry, a whopping 60 per cent of the Assembly size, has to get rid of 24 members.

Some states have done well for themselves. The Chhattisgarh government only exceeds the 15 per cent limit by four, Goa by just one, Orissa and Uttaranchal by two and three, respectively, while the Kerala ministry is an exact fit.

6,School principal held for fraud,"AHMEDABAD: The Bapunagar police on Wednesday arrested the principal of Holy Child School Shashibala Sharma on charges of cheating and fraud. Three other accused Dr Murlidhar Sharma, Hemangini Sharma and Madhubala Mehta, are still absconding.

The BBA College run by the trust that runs the school was also inspected by Gujarat University officials. It was found that some architecture students were studying at the same premises, despite building permission for the college given in Limbadiya village near Ahmedabad, where the trust already runs another school. Even more shocking is the fact that both the school and college in Limbadiya have been given permission to run in a cow-shed!

In a startling revelation, an assistant education inspector (AEI) has claimed that she had first brought irregularities of the now derecognised Holy Child School to the notice of the commissioner of schools as early as 1999-2000.

Kashmira Parikh, now an AEI at Patan recently informed the district education office, Ahmedabad (DEO) that she had submitted an adverse report earlier, against the school for running a dummy teachersâ€™ racket and showing fictitious students on its roster.

""Parikh had prepared the report after a routine inspection of the school and submitted it to then commissioner of schools. This means, the officials did not heed her report at the time,"" says a DEO official.

The latest bit of information points to the fact that the commissionerate of schools and Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSB), that have launched an inspection drive in granted schools, should actually be looking within.

Parikhâ€™s statement proves the fact that financial bungling has been on in many granted schools of the state such as Holy Child, in connivance with education department officials.

""DEO inspectors are expected to inspect every granted school at least once a year. It is true that some of them have been turning a blind eye to the financial irregularities indulged in by schools after accepting bribes,"" an official reveals.

Says director of Diwan Ballubhai School, Justice BJ Diwan: ""The present drive to clean the rot in granted schools will yield results only if the commissionerate identifies corrupt officials within the department too, who have been allowing the school trustees to get away with irregularities.Unless this is done, it will be like sending a thief to catch one.""

7,Top cop arrested for insurance fraud,"AHMEDABAD: A deputy superintendent of police of the CID (Crime and Railways) RN Sharma, was arrested on Wednesday night on charges of fraud for facilitating a fake insurance claim racket where natural deaths were proved as unnatural and insurance claimed on them.

The racket was busted by the CID which had made out five such cases in the last four months where family members of the deceased, in connivance with the police, had claimed huge sums from insurance companies, by turning natural deaths into accidental ones.

Sharma , who was supervising the investigations, was charged with putting up a report that exonerated the policemen as well as the family of the charges and stated the cases to be genuine.

""Besides he also sent a note to the insurance companies, on his own, asking them to compensate the parties, since the claims were genuine, which he was not authorised to,"" said DIG Ashish Bhatia.

Three sub-inspectors and three constables have been arrested in these cases in the last four months, for having manipulated the natural death cases to accidental death ones, and charge-sheeted them.

The cases are from the areas of North Gujarat spread over the districts of Sabarkantha, Mehsana and Gandhinagar. A taluka panchayat president of Mansa taluka in Gandhinagar district, Ishwar Patel, considered to be the kingpin of the racket, was involved in three of these cases, said Bhatia. He too was exonerated by Sharma.

Sharma had earlier fudged up investigations in another dead body scam which was later reinvestigated by the Director-General (Vigilance) and the real accused were arrested.

This is the second DySP to be arrested, after HK Sharma, also from CID (crime) was caught accepting bribe red-handed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau, some months back. RN Sharma will be remanded to police custody and the case is being investigated by police inspector A B Pathan.

9,Another school principal booked,"AHMEDABAD: The district education officer (DEO) has lodged a complaint against principal of Karmashila High School in Nava Vadaj at the Anti-Corruption Bureau, for allegedly attempting to pay a bribe of Rs 2,02,100, to get inquiry against his school wound up.

Principal of the school Dinesh Naik, was attempting to bribe one Narendra Chhabra, who promised to speak to a DEO official and get the job done. DEO HN Chavda told TNN that he nabbed both offenders from a bus stop on the Sabarmati-Gandhinagar Road after being tipped off about their transaction.

â€œChhabra was on a Honda Activa while Naik had come on foot. When we caught up with them, both tried to flee, but we managed to nab them.

Naik told us he was offering the bribe to Chhabra to get the inquiry against his school wound up. Chhabra was holding a box, and said that it was full of money. We have filed an application against the two with the ACB and handed over both men and the money to the bureau,â€� Chavda says.

The DEO had raided Naikâ€™s school on April 26, and found it had indulged in large-scale irregularities in appointment of employees. The school stood to pay up about Rs 20-25 lakh to the government, which is why Naik tried to bribe his way out of the inquiry.
