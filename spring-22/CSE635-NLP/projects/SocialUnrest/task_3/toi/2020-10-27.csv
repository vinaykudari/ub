0,Centre destabilising my govt: Mulayam,"ETAWAH: Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday charged the Centre with destabilising his government.

Addressing a public meeting at the exhibition ground here, Mulayam said that it was on the directives of the Centre that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal raised the â€˜Ayodhya Yatraâ€™ and Ram temple issues to defame his government and create instability in the state.

The chief minister made no announcement for his hometown in his 45-minute-long speech but announced an increase of Rs 25 in the old-age pension from Rs 125 to Rs 150 per month and launched a kisan pension yojana of same amount. He also announced a Rs 15-crore scheme for Etawah, Bharthana and Jaswantnagar under the National Malin Basti Development Scheme.

He thanked party general secretary Amar Singh for taking up the development of the state in a big way by involving all big industrialists in the State Development Council. He said that the government was very keen to providing the necessary infrastructure to the investors.

While addressing the meeting, Amar Singh thanked the people of Etawah for giving a leader like Mulayam Singh Yadav. He said that the last 15-month period was the worst in the history of state.

He said the previous government was busy looting the public and was not bothered about its problems.

1,Amarinder Singh to go by his minister's word,"LUDHIANA: It seems chief minister Amarinder Singh is all set to woo his ministers going by what he said at function organised by industrialists here on Sunday. It appears that for him a minister''s word is enough.

He told TNN: ""If any police officer is rude to any of my ministers, I will suspend him.""

This happened in case of Ludhiana SHO Sandeep Wadhera recently. ""If it were to happen again, I will do it again,"" the chief minister made it very clear.

Asked if the matter had been proven through an inquiry, he said, ""I don''t have to wait for an inquiry report before suspending an officer. The fact that Malkiat Singh Birmi, minister for prisons and urban development, has complained against the officer is sufficient.""

On the other hand, the magisterial inquiry against SHO Sandeep Wadhera by M Jaggi, general assistance to the deputy commissioner, has failed to conclude anything after weeks of investigation.

It was learnt that last statement was recorded 10 days back.

However, even during the investigations, Birmi''s son Hardeep Singh alias Deepu, threatened Wadhera in the presence of the investigation officer.

TNN has documents including a written complaint by Wadhera submitted in the GA''s office stating that Hardeep Singh during the investigations had said to him, ""Teri ta phatti poonjh deya gey"" (We will wipe you clean). The above statement dated October 17, 2003 signed by both Wadhera and M S Jaggi as witness.

Another statement also sheds some light on the episode.

Simarpal Singh, one of complainants, who was riding the motorcycle on the day of the incident has signed a statement that he and his friend Jaspreet Singh were trying to evade the police while going to Sarabhanagar market as ""he was not wearing helmet,"" but they did run into them and had an altercation with the policemen.

Simarpal states that they have realised that ""they have misbehaved"" and are ""aware of their fault"". Also, that they are students and should be allowed to go free.

The statement is signed by both complainants, the councillor, K L Chabbra, and his son, Vivek Chabra, who had intervened at the site of the incident.

It could not be learnt as to why the incident was later pursued by Birmi, whose son Hardeep is a friend of Vivek Chabra.

2,Two youths arrested for looting train passengers,"CHANDIGARH: Two youths were arrested at the Chandigarh railway station on Monday and booked on the charges of offering intoxicating substances and looting train passengers.

Singh Bahadur, a resident of Nepal, and Vikas alias Babloo, a resident of Jharkand, were arrested after a ''victim'' led a team of Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP) officials to them.

Two syringes and Ativan tablets, used for rendering travellers unconscious, were recovered from them.

Sources said the duo was active in Chandigarh, Ambala and Ludhiana and their prime target was migrant workers heading back to their native places carrying money.

As for their modus operandi, they would first befriend their victim, offer him tea or soft drinks laced with intoxicants and take away their money.

They were arrested after Kitabuddin from West Bengal, who was looted on October 23 by the duo and regained consciousness after three days, spotted them at platform no 2. The GRP has taken both of them to Ambala where they will be produced before a court.

3,Divergent selection rules upset GMCH faculty,"CHANDIGARH: Perturbed over divergent selection rules being followed for same posts in different departments of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), harried faculty members have decided to take up the matter with UT Administrator O P Verma.

""Discrepancies"" in recruitment rules is upsetting the seniority list of senior lecturers who have been recruited through UPSC.

This has sparked widespread resentment among faculty members who have already expressed their reservations about the existing rules to officiating director-principal Prof H M Swami.

Speaking to Times News Network, a senior faculty says, ""Three different rules are being followed for recruiting readers in respective departments. This is absurd. We have discussed the matter with directorprincipal who has sought some more time. If the anomalies are not rectified, the gradation list of senior lecturers would go for a toss. The matter needs to be urgently looked into if authorities are concerned about the well being of GMCH.""

The genesis of the controversy can be traced to the time when the recruitment rules were being finalised during Prof S B S Mann''s tenure as director-principal.

""The entry point for any faculty member is a senior lecturer. The problem lies when it comes to promoting them to the rank of reader. The recruitment rules have been framed in an arbitrary manner without taking the faculty into confidence. This is what is causing widespread resentment,"" observes a senior faculty.

As per recruitment rules, while senior lecturers working in the community medicine, haematology and blood transfusion, obstetrics and gynaecology, pathology and physiology departments are directly promoted to the post of reader by the departmental promotion committee without having to appear for interviews, those working on same posts in the departments of anaesthesia, biochemistry, microbiology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, paediatrics, pharmacology, psychiatry, radiology, TB and chest, dermatology, forensic medicine and ENT have to compete with external candidates.

Going by the rules, a reader in these departments can be appointed either through promotion, deputation, short term contract or directly through UPSC.

The rules for surgery department include 50 per cent by promotion and 50 per cent through direct recruitment.

""These anomalies lead to a pick and choose policy and in spite of being higher on the seniority list, some would have to suffer since others through promotion would become readers earlier than them by not having to compete with external candidates. There is already one such case and we are highly disturbed. Deserving candidates from nearly all departments would be deprived of their chances of timely promotions and allied financial and academic benefits,"" says a senior faculty.

4,"After an angry protest, hard grilling for Daler","PATIALA: Singer Daler Mehndi appeared before the Patiala police on Monday in connection with a case of alleged human trafficking against him and four others including one of his brothers, Shamsher.

His questioning continued for over six hours.

Daler, in a Mercedes Benz, arrived exactly at 11 am as directed by the Delhi High Court, but it took him some time to enter the police station.

A large, agitated crowd of relatives of people cheated by Daler blocked his way. There were vociferous sloganeering against him.

Some also tried to damage his car. It was only after a chaotic half-an hour that the police could take Daler out of harm''s way and escorted him away.

Earlier, Daler visited Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib with Mika, where he told newspersons that he would seek a CBI probe into the matter.

Mika followed him in another car. ""I have come here as an artist not as Daler''s brother,"" he said before beating retreat on seeing the angry crowd.

The team that questioned Daler was led by superintendent of police (headquarters) R L Monga and comprised DSP (rural) Bhupinder Singh and inspectors Didar Singh and Shamsher Singh Guddu.

Daler furnished a surety of Rs 5 lakh as directed by the Delhi high court for the ten-day interim bail.

After about two hours of questioning, Dalers'' counsels Ravinder Kumar and Anand Parkash were reportedly asked by the police to leave as they wanted to question the singer in private.

It is believed that Daler was asked about the foreign visits of his troupe, the persons allegedly left behind (""kabootars"") by him in different countries, his bank accounts, property and documents showing his association with his brother Shamsher. (Daler had stated some time back that he had dissociated himself from his brother in 2001.)

Ravinder Kumar told media persons that the matter should be probed by the CBI and they would move an application in the court in this reagrd. He alleged that Punjab police had ""failed to protect Daler from the mob"".

He said they apprehended danger not only to Daler''s but their lives too.

""I would inform the Delhi court about today''s happenings,"" he said. The counsel said that they had enough time to file an application in the local court for regular bail.

SSP Paramraj Singh Umranangal said that they had made ""sufficient arrangements"" for the security of Daler.

The SSP said that if the singer did not cooperate with the police, they would approach the court for his custodial interrogation.

He said that the police already had 31 complaints against Daler, Shamsher and others while four more complaints had been received, Monday.

May be, he could not hold it back or perhaps he thought it might ""soften"" up the investigators, but Daler ``sang"" before his interrogators, though he couldn''t hit the right note.

5,SGPC rules out Dasam Granth's installation,"AMRITSAR: Setting aside all controversies regarding Dasam Granth, the SGPC, on Monday, ruled out possibilities of its installation at any of the gurdwaras, even the Golden Temple.

Talking to media persons here, SGPC chief secretary (honorary) Manjit Singh Calcutta said the installation of Dasam Granth at any of the gurdwaras being controlled by the SGPC was ""next to impossible"" as the granth could not attain the place of the Guru Granth Sahib.

â€œDasam Granth does not possess the status of a living guru, so the SGPC can not accord the same status to it,â€� he added. â€œDasam Granth is mere translation of holy scripture,â€� he asserted.

The statement of Calcutta is considered significant in the Sikh circles as Takht Patna Sahib and Takht Hazoor Sahib had already accorded the status of living guru to the Dasam Granth.

Takht Patna Sahib jathedar Iqbal Singh had declared M S Romana ''tankhayia'' on June 30 when he aired his objectionable views over the Dasam Granth and its existence in a meeting held in US a few months back.

6,Wily ex-minister falls flat on his face,"PATNA: The state capital was witness to some political drama in the ruling coalition on Monday.

Former minister Sanjeev Prasad Toni sent in his resignation from the Congress on Monday, following assurances that he would be given the RJDâ€™s ticket to contest Fatuha assembly bypoll. He had met RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav at around 1 pm and felt assured enough to send in his papers to the state Congress chief.

However, by 6 pm, Toni had received a shock. The RJD ticket went to a relatively low-key party worker, Om Prakash Paswan, leaving Toni high and dry. RJD completely washed its hands off him and party circles were asking â€œToni whoâ€�?. â€œToni never figured in our list because he is not in the party,â€� claimed state RJD chief Abdul Bari Siddiqui.

Speaking to TNN, Toni claimed himself to be a Congressman despite his resignation letter. â€œThere were some differences over Dalit leadership within the party but that has been sorted out,â€� he stressed. He conceded that he had gone to 1, Anne Marg on Monday. â€œBut I wanted to be a Congress candidate supported by the RJD,â€� he pleaded. He seemed to forget that he had wrote his resignation letter from the party earlier in the day.

On Monday morning, Toni tendered his resignation and RJD sources indicated that he would be made partyâ€™s official candidate for Fatuha assembly bypoll. In his resignation sent to the party state president, he complained that he had been ignored in the Congress and Dalit leaders, who were political featherweights, like Faguni Ram and Jyoti, were given priority. â€œThe Congress does not need me anymore,â€� he wrote in his letter.

However, RJD sources indicated that Toniâ€™s name was dropped at the last moment as state Congress chief Ram Jatan Sinha objected to the RJDâ€™s move, insisting that it would amount to encouraging desertion from an ally party. The message was loud and clear. The state party would lodge a strong protest with the central Congress leadership (read Sonia Gandhi).

â€œI told Lalooji that giving the RJD ticket to Toni was against â€œcoalition dharmaâ€�. If he was serious about defeating communal forces, he should have given the Fatuha seat to Congress,â€� said Sinha. He later thanked Laloo Prasad Yadav for showing political honesty and respecting the sentiments of state Congress leaders.

Incidentally, the RJD on Monday announced the candidature of Shanta Devi from Barachatti and Shahid Ali Khan from Sitamarhi.

7,New jobs for axed govt employees,"BANGALORE: All the 5,014 former government employees, who were axed following a Supreme Court order scrapping rural weightage, would be given new jobs by the first week of November, according to law and parliamentary affairs minister D.B. Chandre Gowda.

Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Gowda said the final notification was being prepared and would be placed before the next cabinet meeting for approval.

""Where there are no vacancies, supernumerary posts would be created to absorb them,"" he stated. The draft notification to absorb these employees was issued on August 28 and objections were invited.

The government received 208 objections. ""After considering all the objections, the draft notification has been suitably amended. All the objections have been suitably addressed,"" he said.

Gowda said the employees were not being reappointed but were given fresh appointments. This means their services before being displaced would not be considered for seniority or promotions.

""We are appointing them on humanitarian grounds on a permanent basis,"" he added. The employees would also have to withdraw their provident fund and open a new account.

9,Gujarat govt criticised in Sarabhai case,"MUMBAI: Some prominent personalities have criticised the alleged â€˜framingâ€™ of Ahmedabad-based danseuse Mallika Sarabhai on an emigration racket charge by the Gujarat government.

A few months before, Sarabhaiâ€™s Darpana Academy in Ahmedabad had planned a trip to the US for some of its students, which had to be cancelled. One of them complained to the police about money being taken, allegedly in return for a visa to emigrate illegally, and the money not being returned. Sarabhai has denied the charge, saying the money and passports were all returned when the trip was cancelled.

However, the police have registered a charge of alleged cheating and illegal activity and hearings have been held on Sarabhaiâ€™s petition for anticipatory bail against arrest. She has also appealed for help.

The signatories say she has cooperated with the probe and is still being harassed, because of her strong stand on last yearâ€™s anti-Muslim pogrom; she has filed a case in the Supreme Court on the matter.

Some of the signatories include Vijay Tendulkar, Rajmohan Gandhi, BG Verghese, Jaidev Hattangady, Alyque Padamsee, Kuldip Nayar, Shabana Azmi, Atul Setalvad, Javed Akhtar, Zoya Hasan and Irfan Habib.

10,Industry toasts CM rally brake,"KOLKATA: From delight to distress â€“ industryâ€™s mood had swung from one extreme to the other following Justice Amitava Lalaâ€™s order restricting rallies and the political partiesâ€™ decision to resist it.

On Monday, exactly a month after the judgment, the smiles returned with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjeeâ€™s initiative to discipline demonstrations.

â€œItâ€™s a step in the right direction,â€� said RPG group vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka. His happiness was tempered with caution. â€œImplementation depends on consensus. I hope everyone supports it.â€�

Exide Industries chairman S.B. Ganguly shared his measured optimism. â€œIf the proposals are implemented, Bengal would be able to redeem its tarnished image,â€� he said.

He wondered why the government had earlier opposed the â€œpro-peopleâ€� order. â€œRallies are held in other cities. But here they are too frequent and over flimsy issues,â€� he said.

Adi Godrej could not resist saying, â€œMumbai was more normal a day after the blasts than Kolkata is on an average day.â€�

Bengal Ambuja MD Harsh Neotia said Bhattacharjeeâ€™s initiative â€œattempts to strike a balance between a popular expression of protest and peopleâ€™s opinion at largeâ€�.

Nicco Industries co-chairman Abhijit Sen felt regulation of rallies would not be a problem as the proposal came from the chief minister.

But what about opposition from other parties? â€œThey will feel the heat of public pressure,â€� he quipped.

â€œItâ€™s public pressure that forced the CM to review his stand. The test will be in implementation. Regulating two rallies wonâ€™t do. If the government succeeds in instilling discipline, it will be commendable,â€� said Sree Cement chief H.M. Bangur.

11,Prince Charles arrives in India,"NEW DELHI: Britain''s Prince Charles arrived here on Tuesday afternoon for a nine-day visit, over a decade after his last visit to the subcontinent with his then wife Diana, Princess of Wales.

Charles'' visit will highlight ""the close links and partnership between UK and India, focussing on heritage and restoration, sustainable development and youth entrepreneurship,"" the British High Commission said.

The Prince will spend three days in Delhi, four days in Rajasthan and two days in Mumbai.

Commenting on the visit, the Prince of Wales had said in London on Monday, ""I am very much looking forward to returning to India, a country for which I have always had a particular affection.""

14,Police identifies trouble spots for state polls,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police have identified about 200 trouble spots which may witness violence during the forthcoming poll.

Okhla, Mehrauli, Sadar, Nand Nagri and Patel Nagar are some of the areas where the police is anticipating trouble. The spots were identified through a survey conducted earlier this month.

â€˜â€˜The survey has been conducted for the deployment of troops in a phased manner. We do not want any confusion during the elections,â€™â€™ said a senior police officer.

â€˜â€˜So far, there is only one highly sensitive area in Delhi. Okhla has been declared so due to the encounter which took place there immediately after the Red Fort shoot-out,â€™â€™ said the officer.

Besides, the area has a mixed population. A few pockets of Mehrauli, too, have been put in the high-sensitive category.

The force inspected about 2,500 polling stations, comprising of 9,000 booths. The past history of the booths was also considered.

The sensitive polling booths, categorised due to having a mixed population, include Nabi Karim, Lahori Gate, Hauz Qazi, Sadar Bazar, Seemapuri, Nand Nagri and Geeta Colony. The second category includes areas which witnessed violence in the last elections.

He said that the equation is likely to change if some other parties enter the fray. â€˜â€˜There are some parties which fight elections with muscle power. This could bring in more areas, adjoining Haryana, in the sensitive list,â€™â€™ the officer added.

15,Defunct MCD trucks have no takers,"NEW DELHI: The worn-down fleet of garbage trucks lying as junk in the workshops of Municipal Corporation of Delhi has no takers.

A senior official said: â€˜â€˜The MCD is finding it difficult to dispose off about 130 defunct trucks and loaders. The fleet occupying space as junk, if sold, would fetch about Rs 3 crore to the MCD.â€™â€™

MCD needs to clear the junk as space would be required to accommodate the new fleet of garbage trucks. The civic agency has already bought about 75 new trucks to lift garbage in the city and plans to buy 100 more twin-bin trucks by January.

Additional commissioner (CSE), Ramesh Negi, said: â€˜â€˜There is also the compulsion to clear the junk before the next financial year as private operators will be handling the repairs and maintenance works in these workshops after the privatisation of sanitation services.â€™â€™

MCD has proposed to privatise sanitation services in six zones â€” south, central, west, Karol Bagh, Sadar Paharganj and City. Out of the nine automobile workshops, three will be given to private operators.

A senior official said: â€˜â€˜Efforts are on to dispose off these trucks and loaders. It seems the scrap market is going through a lull and hence, nobody is responding to our tender advertisements.â€™â€™

About the old fleet of trucks, officials admit that most trucks are over 15 years old. â€˜â€˜Of the 650-odd trucks, over 200 are decrepit Shaktimans and another 300 trucks are totally obselete,â€™â€™ a senior official said.

Much of the filth lying on the roads has been blamed on the broken down vehicles whose lifespan is about 10 years.

16,Students to protest change in ATKTs,"MUMBAI: Hundreds of engineering students are likely to take out a morcha to Mumbai University on Thursday after vice-chancellor B L Mungekar refused to relent to the students'' demand of increasing the number of ATKTs for students following the revised course.

A university circular has asked engineering colleges to implement a rule which bars promotion of those students to the fifth term who have not cleared more than four subjects (ATKTs) in their earlier terms. Mr Mungekar said that the rule was applicable only to students in the revised course.

The VC called a meeting with principals of engineering colleges on Tuesday to know if any of them were defying the circular.

17,State govt scraps welfare scheme for jobless,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has given a silent burial a key welfare scheme which assured a monthly financial aid up to Rs 300 for the educated unemployed who are registered with the employment exchange offices across the state.

The decision to discontinue scheme was taken way back July 2000 by the then Vilasrao Deshmukh government, and thereby the state saving Rs 25 crore annually.

The move, however, seemed to be a closely guarded state secret with the authorities reluctant to make any announcement, presumably fearing a public backlash.

Explaining the reasons for discontinuing the scheme, a few bureaucrats at Mantralaya said that â€œthere were lacunae in the schemeâ€™â€™ and it had to be modified. However, there was little explanation done as to why it was announced, despite the state cabinet endorsing the decision.

Former chief secretary and present advisor to the state employment and self-employment ministry Dinesh Afzulpurkar said, â€œThe scheme has been suspended since 2000 as we discovered that beneficiaries of the state aid continued to take the allowance even after securing a job. The applicants rarely reported their employment. The state, therefore, felt the need to revise the scheme. So, we have now formulated fresh programmes which promise employment opportunities for the jobless.â€™â€™

Under the earlier scheme, which came into being in 1978, the state had decided that all educated unemployed would be eligible for a monthly allowance for a period of three years or till such time that they were provided with jobs befitting their educational qualifications.

Those with a minimum qualification of SSC were entitled Rs 100 per month. Degree holders were given some minor work with a government body or local self-government for which they were paid Rs 300 per month.

â€œThe amount may be very little in the present context but was a welfare programme which offered assistance for these youths as an entitlement. The Democratic Front government, however, stopped welfare being an entitlement for the millions jobless,â€™â€™ a Mantralaya official told TNN.

At present, less than 30,000 jobless, who were registered with the state prior to July 2000, receiving the state aid. â€œAll those who have enrolled after July not eligible for any assistance,â€™â€™ Mr Afzulpurkar said.

Moreover, with the public sector virtually closing the doors fresh appointments, the staterun employment exchanges left with very little to offer for those who are registered with them.

18,UAE police confirm drug arrests,"MUMBAI: Farhan Azmi, son of city Samajwadi Party president Abu Asim Azmi, Boney, son of automobile designer Dilip Chhabria, and two others have been charged with drug â€œconsuming and dealingâ€™â€™, an officer from Dubaiâ€™s Al-Rifa police station told this newspaper on the phone on Tuesday.

Azmi, Chhabria and two others, Shaan Sippy and Prasad Diwadkar, were arrested last week by the Dubai police for allegedly possessing and consuming drugs. Sources in the Mumbai police said they were found to be possessing â€˜charasâ€™.

The Dubai police officer, who requested anonymity, said all four of them were found in possession of drugs. He said he did not know the type or the quantity of the seized drugs or the place from where they were purchased.

Mumbai police sources said the youths were arrested from Imperial Hotel in Dubai on October 21. They had gone to Dubai to watch a motor racing event.

Mr Chhabria and Mr Azmi have confirmed that their sons were arrested in a drug case but claimed that they were not involved but were arrested on suspicion because someone in their group was carrying drugs.

Mr Azmi said that he had not contacted the Dubai police or hired a lawyer. He said he had not yet spoken with his son after his arrest and would first try to find out if he needed legal help.

He denied telling the media that he had broken relations with his son and claimed that he had been misquoted. Sources in the Mumbai police said that Shaan Sippy, son of the late film producer Vijay Sippy, was a British national.

â€œThe Dubai police have seized a British passport from him,â€™â€™ an IPS officer in Mumbai said.

While the Dubai police were tightlipped about the seized drug, an IPS officer in Mumbai who had spoken to his counterpart in Dubai said, â€œCharas weighing about five grams was found in cigarettes recovered from the hotel room in which the four were arrested. One of the accused, Diwadkar, has been accused by Dubai police of narco-trafficking,â€™â€™ he stated.

Police sources said that the laws in Dubai were stringent in narcotics cases. â€œA person convicted for narco trafficking can even be sentenced to death,â€™â€™ a senior officer stated.

Meanwhile, the Dubai police have informally asked a Mumbai crime branch officer about the antecedents of the four persons. â€œThey have been informed about the background of the four persons. All of them have no criminal record in Mumbai,â€™â€™ this officer told TNN.

The crime branch is also probing whether narco kingpin Iqbal Mirchi, who is suspected of having benami stakes in Imperial Hotel, has a role to play in the narcotics case.

Mirchi, who is accused in a murder case and charged with running an international narcotics trafficking racket in Mumbai, is currently ensconced in London. The Indian government had failed in its efforts to extradite him to India.
