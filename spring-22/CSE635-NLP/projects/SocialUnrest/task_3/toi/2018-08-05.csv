1,National policy must to combat ISI: Gill,"new delhi: lack of a national policy to deal with isi-engineered proxy war and terrorism is a major hurdle in tackling the menace, according to former director general of punjab police k p s gill. as a result, every state has its own way of dealing with the situation- punjab deals with it in its own way and kashmir has its own way of dealing with it, gill said at a function in the capital. with such a situation growing over the years, there is no part in the country which has not been pentrated by the isi, says a former ib official. besides jammu and kashmir, north-east is the prime hunting ground of isi. in fact, this area is the most preferred place for isi activities, the former ib official and author of 'isi ka atank' (terror of isi) r n p singh said. even in southern india, which is far away from the pak border, isi has developed many centres for its activities, he said. according to him, isi has spread its network in more than 240 cities in the country. ""it is true that isi has built a large network in the country, but india as a large and strong country is fully capable of countering this situation"", said d c pathak, former ib director.

5,Morning walkers protest against fee,"lucknow: they drive in flashy cars, spend a fortune on track-suits and designer jogging shorts and flash latest models of cellphone while going for morning stroll at the sylvan splendour gardens of national botanical research institute (nbri) just to show how busy they are even at 0530 hrs. they discuss all their important business at the lush green lawns of nbri, plan their kitty parties and fix dinners before they return to their home finishing their morning walk in style. but when asked to pay a nominal one rupee a day as morning walk fee, they hold demonstration saying ""fee on free air"" is in violation of article 21 of the constitution. it is, however, a different story that when these elite morning walkers through their association in lucknow moved the lucknow bench of allahabad high court last week protesting against the imposition of the fee by nbri authorities, the court summarily rejected their petition. the morning walkers have now approached prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on the issue through a local bjp mla and also upcc president prakash jaiswal to intervene in the matter and the pmo has made a query from the nbri in this regard. the nbri director, dr p pushpangadan, said the authorities had taken the decision to impose a fee and issue an identity card for the morning walkers after a series of indisciplined activities, disturbing, destroying and stealing of many precious and rare plants, material and even costly installations in recent times. there were also incidents of attempted shooting and vandalism in recent times in the campus, he said quoting an fir lodged with the hazratganj police station in june last. ""recurrence of such criminal incidents compelled us to review the situation and in a pragmatic manner we decided to introduce the pass system with a token fee,"" he pointed out. while it is a free morning walk for the senior citizens, the token monthly fee from september one next was rs 30, rs 70 for quarterly membership, rs 140 half-yearly and rs 250 as annual membership, the director said adding it is not a commercial venture but the money collected from this will be utilised for the basic maintenance of the garden. interestingly a majority of the morning walkers have made a beeline to the nbri to collect their free of cost forms to obtain the membership and the i-cards during last 15-days but some of the members are still hoping that the pmo would come to their rescue and save them from paying the ""fee for the walk"" which they consider as their fundamental right. a spokesman of the morning walkers association taking serious exception to the nbri's move to impose fee said ""throughout our lives, we have gained free entry to nbri garden, why should we pay any fee now now"". ""do we need to pay for the clean air"", he asked and cited provisions of the constitution in support of his contention. the habit transformation instructor, a local ngo, has however welcomed the nbri's move in this regard and said in its communication ""there is no free meal in life, your stand is saluted"". ""it is shame that you drive in flashy cars and carry mobiles with you but you cannot pay a rupee a day"", said an office bearer of ngo haryali. ""these days, you do not even get a glass of pure water free of cost"", he pointed out. ""you can also spend a lot of money on attending gyms and classes for yoga and meditation but why such an objection now"", he asked. the nbri director dr pushpangadan in his response to the pmo query exuded confidence that the introduction of pass system with nominal fee would only give more benefits to the morning walkers and protect them from miscreants as well as help to protect and preserve national assets and property of the national institute. ""i do not think our action is arbitrary or was meant to hurt the feelings of the morning walkers,"" the director said in his reply to the pmo.",lucknow
6,10 mn disabled still to get I-cards: minister,"kolkata: over 10 million disabled people, comprising 20 per cent of india's disabled population, are yet to receive the identity cards which allows them benefits mandatory under the law, west bengal sunderban affairs minister kanti ganguly said on sunday. the minister, who is also part of an ngo for handicapped children, was speaking at the inaugural session of access 2001, an exhibition of assistive devices, teaching kits and other devices for the handicapped persons. ""without these cards, the handicapped persons cannot get free treatment or be eligible for the jobs reserved for the disabled,"" he said. state social welfare minister biswanath choudhury admitted the problem. ""we have financial constraints, and so we are not able to give as many cards as we would have liked,"" he said. that is why many handicapped persons often throng the state secretariat to get their cards. ""we are building three disabled rehabilitation centres at jalpaiguri, south dinajpur and murshidabad, which will help these people to a great extent,"" he said. union minister of state for social justice and empowerment maneka gandhi admitted that the problems of the disabled were varied. ""we do not yet have an exact count of the number of disabled persons in india. we hope to have our figures soon once the census figures are ready,"" she said. the 2001 census, for the first time, had a component to count the number of people in this category. gandhi urged the state government to take faster measures to ensure better facilities for the disabled. ""the retired doctors can be used at the disabled rehabilitation centres in the districts to examine the cases and give them the certificates necessary for getting the cards,"" she said. the union government spent rs 42 crore on projects relating to the disabled last year. ""the figure will increase this year,"" she said.

7,ITC chairman against BAT increasing stake in VST,"kolkata: itc chairman y c deveshwar, whose term has just been extended for another five years, is opposed to allowing london based parent company, british american tobacco (bat) to increase its stake in vst industries. ""my personal view is in line with the government's view. why should we do that (allow bat to increase stake in vst)? we are trying to do many things to control consumption of tobacco and at the same time you want to encourage it,"" deveshwar said. deveshwar's comments came immediately after the company's annual general meeting here on friday in which shareholders approved the extension of his term as chairman of india's largest tobacco company. recently, commerce and industry minister mursoli maran made it clear that any proposal for fresh investment in the tobacco sector would be considered strictly as per existing policy guidelines, under which bat would require a noc from itc for increasing stake in vst since it holds a stake in itc. the current guidelines also does not favour any fresh foreign investment in the tobacco sector. deveshwar's comment gave another interesting twist to the ongoing takeover war over vst involving itc and damani controlled brightstar investments of mumbai. the itc chairman, however, made it clear that this was his personal view and that ultimately it would be itc board which would take a final decision in the matter. bat had expressed its intention of increasing its stake in vst in the wake of the takeover tussle between brightstar and itc subsidiary russel credit investments. a bat spokesperson recently confirmed that the company was in the process of preparing its proposal to be placed before the foreign investment promotion board (fipb). the vst faced a hostile takeover bid from brightstar early this year when the mumbai-based company after picking up nearly 15 per cent stake in the tobacco major from the open market made an open offer to increase its stake. itc immediately jumped into the fray and made a counter offer through its investment arm, russel credit, and picked up at least 10 per cent vst shares. the bid, however, could not reach its logical conclusion following litigations as a number a petitions were filed in different courts in the country. but damanis have already expressed their intention of selling their holding in vst, which is currently estimated to be upward of 20 per cent. deveshwar had earlier said that his company would like to increase its stake in vst by picking up vst shares from the market as well as those held by brightstar ""if they are available"". but now he made it clear that itc did not want a controlling stake in vst. ""it is not our objective to seek control and we are not making any hostile bid"", deveshwar said here. thus the itc chairman made it amply clear that the intentions of itc was simply not to allow anybody else to take controlling stake in vst, not even bat, which currently has around 32 per cent stake in the hyderabad-based company.

8,BVA relents following assuarnce from govt,"patna: with the animal husbandry director giving an assurance to it that the government will be releasing only 25 liquid containers of frozen semen bank to co-operative of milk producers' federation (compfed) instead of 84 as announced earlier, the bihar veterinary association (bva) has removed the lock it had put on the office of the bank in protest against the government decision. the bva had locked the office of the bank to prevent the transfer of the containers to the compfed. the bva general secretary said that the ah director had told the association that the 25 containers being transferred to the compfed was a temporary arrangement to enable it to transport semen to its 700 odd artificial insemination centres (ais). he told the vets that the compfed would return them as soon as the government ai centres became functional. at present the 1401 government ai centres, frozen semen bank and its units were lying defunct for the past five years. a senior official of the ahd said that the government would be spending rs.48 lakh during the current financial year to revive the frozen semen bank and its three units located at muzaffarpur, gaya and banka.

9,Resentment among govt staff over flat allotment,"patna: the allotment of flats to 16 officials of the bihar legislative assembly, two officials of the bihar legislative council and a lecturer of j d women's college here from the central pool by the building construction department (bcd) on july 30 has caused a lot of resentment among the state government employees waiting for the housing facility for the last several months. although the central pool flats are meant for state government employees only, 19 of the 124 such flats allotted on july 30 by the bcd went to those who are not state government employees. bcd secretary a k sinha, however, justified the allotment of central pool flats to the assembly and council employees, saying this has been done in the light of the assurance given by the government to one of the two houses of the state legislature more than three years ago. sinha said the government had assured the house that it would continue to allot flats from the central pool to assembly and council officials till the creation of a separate pool for them. the government had also assured the house that assembly and council employees would not be evicted from the houses allotted to them from the central pool in the past, he maintained. but what has surprised the government employees most is the allotment of a new central pool flat to a commissioner-rank official's wife, tejeshwari lal, a lecturer at j d women's college which is a constituent unit of magadh university. tejeshwari does not live with her husband. sinha said the bcd has simply given a fresh accommodation to tejeshwari, who had been allotted a flat in the officers' hostel on bailey road a few years ago on compassionate ground. the government has now allotted her a bigger flat, he added. bcd minister mohammad taslimuddin, who is the chairman of the departmental allotment committee, did not appear to be happy with the allotment of central pool flats to several officials of the assembly and council. this is not proper, he said. he also did not approve of the fresh accommodation given to tejeshwari. he said he did not have the time to look into the names of all the allottees at the committee meeting. the mistakes, if any, would be rectified, he added. bcd sources said a large number of government flats, several of them in the officers' hostel, are under unauthorised occupation of the people having strong political connections. although the government has evicted more than 100 such unauthorised occupants during the last few months, about 100 flats are still under unauthorised occupation in patna. sinha said the government has initiated measures to evict these people. the allotment of central pool flats from the discretionary quota of the bcd minister has also created anomaly. while a statistical officer of jagjivan ram research institute here has succeeded in getting a central pool flat from the minister's quota, director of the institute abdul malik has been denied one despite his being a former minister. the minister's quota constitutes 5 per cent of the total number of central pool flats allotted at a time.

10,CPM demand anganwadi workers' right to contest polls,"hyderabad: the state committee of the cpm has demanded that the state government withdraw its orders making anganwadi workers and helpers ineligible to contest the gram panchayat elections. ""the orders (go ms no 23) issued on the last day of filing nominations is against the election code of conduct as well as the court judgments on the panchayat elections,"" cpm state secretary bv raghavulu said here on sunday. the contentious go ms no 23 aims at deleting clause ii in go ms no 7 (march 7, 1996) of the women development and child welfare department, which permits anganwadi workers and helpers to hold elected posts such as sarpanch and mptc member. the order was issued in response to a clarification sought by the state election commission (sec) secretary, as permitting anganwadi workers/helpers to hold elected posts was not in conformity with section 18 (1) of ap panchayat raj act, 1994. raghavulu said the party would write a letter to the sec and also approach the high court as the latest go was in contravention to the court''s orders. the court had directed the government to permit anganwadi workers to contest the elections in response to a petition filed by cpm on the non-implementation of orders permitting anganwadi workers to contest the polls in some districts, he said. he criticised the government for adopting, `double standards'' on issues pertaining to anganwadi workers. ""when the workers demand a hike in pay, the government claims that they are not its employees and are working on honorarium. but when it comes to permitting them to contest the elections, the government makes them ineligible by putting them on par with government staff,"" he said. he urged the sec to permit those anganwadi workers and helpers who have filed nominations to contest the polls. the centre for indian trade unions (citu), the trade union wing of cpm, too criticised the state government for issuing the orders. ""the orders issued on the last day of filing nominations only reflect the ruling telugu desam party''s fears regarding the forthcoming elections to gram panchayats,"" citu general secretary s veeraiah said. the cpm has also decided to distribute pamphlets outlining the ill-effects of reforms introduced by the present government in power, irrigation and other sectors, raghavulu added.

11,"Factory fails to pay dues, farmers retaliate","mysore: two years ago, when the khoday's took over the mahadeshwara sugar factory in kollegal taluk, the farmers in chamarajnagar and mysore districts were an elated lot. they thought they would supply sugarcane to the factory without any let-up. but that joy was just a flash in the pan as the khoday's refused to run the factory and sold it to a tamil nadu-based firm. but for reasons unknown, the new management has failed to pay the dues to the farmers, leave alone reopen it. now, what has worsened the situation for the farmers in these two districts is the drought. neither the government has made any effort to pay back the rs-12 crore dues to the farmers nor has it made any effort to pressure the new firm to pay the dues. thus, the distraught farmers decided to fight tooth and nail the management's apathy by staging a dharna at the factory site on friday. backed by the karnataka rajya raitha sangha, the farmers threatened to storm into the factory godowns and take the sugar stocks in lieu of the amount owed by the management for the sugarcane they had supplied last october. but with the intervention of the police and the local officials, the agitators decided to wait till august 16. ""if we fail to get the money, we'll force our entry into the godowns and take away the sugarcane stock,"" the farmers said. but the management sources said they cannot sell the sugar stocks in the open market without the central government's permission. ""if the government gives us the permission, we will be able to mobilise money from the banks and other financial institutions to pay the dues,"" a management source said adding that the management is serious to reopen the factory. in the meantime, union minister srinivas prasad has said permission has been given to the management to sell 1,000 tons of sugar and assured it of permitting to sell another 3,000 tons. following the farmers' threat, the management on saturday agreed to pay the dues partially and clear the remaining later. ""we will pay rs 5 crore by august 16,"" the management announced. but the farmers are sceptical. they felt the new deadline is a gimmick to buy time and ward off their threat. amid all this, a state minister's plan to buy the sugar factory from the tamil nadu-based firm has further confounded the farmers.
