0,SP to use coupons for collecting funds for party offices,"LUCKNOW: Now the Samajwadi Party will use coupons for collection of funds which will be used to build party offices at block levels. But party president Mulayam Singh Yadav warned his partymen not to rope in officials in the coupon drive.

The SP, according to party leaders, was planning to print coupons on a large scale for this purpose. â€œThe party had conveniently forgotten the fact that a few months earlier when the Bahujan Samaj Party had distributed coupons to its MPs, MLAs and ministers, the Samajwadi Party leaders had vehemently criticised the same,â€� commented a politician. Mayawati had fixed quotas for party ministers, MPs and MLAs to collect funds for the party.

But taking a lesson from the controversy that the BSP coupons had generated, Mulayam told his partymen on Saturday not to associate the officials in any way in collection of funds through coupons, and warned party workers of stern action if anyone was found to be seeking official help in the collection drive.

1,Can police arrest Daler Mehndi?,"PATIALA: Can the police arrest Daler Mehndi after the expiry of his interim bail and before the disposal of his regular bail application? While legal experts are divided on this issue, in a conversation with TNN on Sunday DIG Patiala Range Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota said that since Dalerâ€™s anticipatory bail had expired on Saturday night so there was no bar to the police arresting him.

However, advocate Brijinder Singh Sodhi claimed that the police could not arrest Daler. According to various judgements of the apex court and various high courts, if a time was granted for filing regular bail and if the bail was filed within the prescribed time, the police could not arrest the person till the disposal of his bail application, Sodhi claimed.

In fact, in the eyes of law the accused was presumed to be in custody and he was supposed to be present in the court when the arguments on his bail plea would be heard, Sodhi elaborated. Former president of the bar association Balvir Singh Billing said that Daler could be arrested. However, Balwant Singh Jandu, a senior advocate based in Patiala, said before the expiry of his interim bail, Daler himself should surrender before the court to file regular bail application but he had not done so and now the police could arrest him.

2,Six arrested after group clash in Old City,"LUCKNOW: A group clash in Thakurganj saw heavy brick-batting among residents on Sunday afternoon. The situation was brought under control after police reached the scene and arrested six persons.

Shyama Devi, wife of potter Agnu Lodhi, was overseeing construction of a sunshade atop the main entrance to her house in a narrow bylane, adjacent to Jafri Masjid of the Shia community, in Zakariya Nagar.

This was the same sunshade over which the local Shia residents had objected to when it was initially being constructed in May 2003.

The basis of objection was that the Alum taken out by the Shia devout would not be able to pass from the narrow bylane once the sunshade was brought up. At that time, Agnu had agreed in writing that the sunshade would not be constructed.

When Shyama Devi began to oversee the construction work on Sunday morning, the Shia devout returning from the mosque after offering Zohar prayers in the afternoon again objected.

One of the residents, Shabbu reportedly climbed up the bamboo support erected for laying the sunshade and began to dismantle it.

This led to a scuffle between Shayam Deviâ€™s sons and Shabbu. The situation took a turn for the worse when Shabbu allegedly fell from the bamboo support on which he was standing.

Tempers ran high as the commotion brought local residents from the two communities face to face, and heavy brick-batting ensued, in which Shabbu, Farzana and Shamshul suffered injuries.

Though the police were informed immediately, they took an hour to reach the scene. Senior officials too reached the site and six persons, including four sons of Agnu and two of their relatives, were arrested after an FIR was lodged in connection with the incident by the father of Shabbu. Shabbu and Farzana had to be admitted to Balramphur Hospital from where the latter was discharged after being administered first aide. Shabbu was still undergoing treatment for his fracture injuries.

3,"Badal now completely desperate, say ministers","CHANDIGARH: Two senior ministers Jagjit Singh and Mohinder Singh Kaypee have alleged that former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal,who had turned corruption into a tool of administration during his tenure, was now completely desperate and panicky.

Justifying delay in the filling of challan in the case of disproportionate assets against Badal, the two ministers said the Punjab government wants to be doubly sure of the charges and verify the earlier evaluations of properties of Badal, his wife Surinder Kaur and son Sukhbir.

â€˜â€˜The delay, if any, in putting up the challan is understandable because the VB,which has already put up challans in courts against 11 ministers of erstwhile Badal government, wants to be sure about its investigations and facts,â€™â€™ they said. The much-awaited challan detailing Badalâ€™s disproportionate assets would be filed soon and the disclosures would shock not only his opponents but his supporters too.

They further claimed that conflict in the SAD over who would lead the party in Badalâ€™s absence has started. While Badalâ€™s nephew Manpreet claimed that a contingency plan has been finalised, Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has denied it and Tohra has maintained that only Badal would decide the future course of action.

Taking exception to Badal describing Amarinder Singh as a â€˜â€˜cheap stunt manâ€™â€™ who has been adopting political gimmicks to defame Akali, the two ministers said that Badal had been arrested in the past and given VIP treatment but this time he would be treated like any other criminal. Denying dissidence, the two leaders said that the Punjab Congress was well-knit and united, and was fully behind Amarinder Singh. Punjab under him has been rated as the third best administered state in the country, they claimed.

4,Agent’s arrest exposes ECNR fraud,"HYDERABAD: The Begumpet police have revealed a nexus between staff at the immigration counters at the Hyderabad airport and travel agents who produced fake travel documents to send people to the Gulf countries.

The racket came to light with the arrest of a travel agent, Shaik Asif Ahmed, at the Rajiv Gandhi Interntional terminal a couple of days ago.Begumpet sub inspector A Babu Rao and two constables took Ahmed to the police station after he failed to give a satisfactory reply about his movements at the airport.

Ahmed admitted to the police that he was working as a sub agent for Mohammed Zaheeruddin, a travel agent from Shahalibanda. His job was to push passengers with forged ECNR stamps on their travel documents to the Gulf countries and some immigration officials were helping them doing so.

He, however, told police that it was only Zaheeruddin who has contacts with the officers. The officers are yet to be identified.

Police recovered three rubber stamps of the superintendent of Visakhapatnam passport office, some cash, one scooter, a mobile phone and some documents from the accused.It, however, is not the first time that role of officials entrusted with immigration procedures in such deals has come to light. Two and a half years ago, one assistant commissioner of police, two inspectors, a handful of sub inspectors and constables were suspended for allowing passengers with fake travel documents to fly out of the country from Hyderabad airport.

Unholy nexus

â€¢Police recover fake rubber stamps from the agent

â€¢Agent spills beans on nexus between officials and touts

â€¢Police yet to identify the erring airport officials

5,Give sugarcane farmers their due: Sena,"PUNE: Shiv Sena MLC Kanhaiyalal Gidwani told a press conference here on Sunday that, should the state government fail to pay the statutory minimum price to sugarcane farmers, his party would take up the matter with the Centre.

Gidwani said the Union government had fixed the â€œSMP at Rs 690 per tonne for 8.5 per cent recovery rate, and an additional Rs 80 for every additional percent of recoveryâ€�.

Given the fact that the average recovery in the state was 11 per cent, the SMP worked out to Rs 960 per tonne, Gidwani said. Sugar factories are supposed to pay the SMP within a fortnight of receiving the produce, he said.

The state government recently announced that, given its financial condition, it would pay the farmers only Rs 560 per tonne as the first and final SMP instalment. Gidwani alleged that the â€œstate was thus cheating the farmers of Rs 400 per tonneâ€�.

â€œAround 25 sugar factories were yet to clear Rs 200 crore towards last yearâ€™s SMP. This, too, needs to be cleared,â€� Gidwani added. Gidwani wondered how the state government could pay cotton growers.

â€œIf the SMP for cotton is Rs 1,925 per tonne, why is the state government paying them Rs 2,500,â€� he asked. Gidwani said that, like last year, sugarcane farmers might take to the streets if the government failed to pay them the right price for their produce.

On the sugar export scam, the MLC said that the Senaâ€™s action committee would move court if the state government failed to act on the directives of the chief director, Union ministry of food and civil supplies, in this regard.

6,Students suffer rule of stick,"KOLKATA: Believe it or not, corporal punishment in Kolkata schools is on the rise. The Indian Psychiatry Association has observed this trend while compiling data on complaints received from students and their guardians.

Recently, guardians of students from a reputed school in south Kolkata approached the press with complaints of beating and other corporal punishments in classrooms.

Teachers admit that many in their fraternity often use violence, in spite of being trained against doing so.

â€œI would not be amazed if the figures reveal that such incidents have gone up in the recent past. Corporal punishment can never be condoned and teachers are trained not to use violence. However, sometimes both teachers and students come from violent backgrounds,â€� says Bishnu Roy, general secretary of the Government School Teachersâ€™ Association.

He claimed that parents often came to school and asked teachers to beat their children, even for small mistakes. â€œStudents are continuously threatened at home by parents. Recently, when I called the father of a child to school, he called me up to say that he had appointed four â€˜mastersâ€™ to look after his sonâ€™s education and had no time to visit the school.

Such behaviour makes students turn unruly in class and teachers often lose their patience,â€� Roy added.

Psychiatrists pegged down the problem to low-paid teachers and larger number of students in the class. â€œSchool â€˜phobiaâ€™ is on the rise in Kolkata.

There are no facilities for counselling in the schools and the pressure on students is on the rise. At puberty, students suffer from a number of mental blocks which are cleared neither by the parents nor by the teachers. As a result, they become difficult to manage and get beaten in class,â€� said Dr Ranadip Ghosh Roy of the IPA.

Gerry Arathoon, deputy secretary of the Council for The Indian School Certificate Examinations, felt corporal punishment was not advisable.

â€œThough such matters are normally handled by the school managements, we have not received any complaints from students or their guardians. However, we advise teachers not to resort to such means,â€� he said.

Officials from the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education claimed violent incidents did not usually occur in government schools. â€œHowever,we have received reports from some private schools. A possible reason is that the teachers are not properly trained and are usually underpaid,â€� they said.

7,"No thought of early LS polls, says Venkaiah","HYDERABAD: BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday sought to end speculations of early Lok Sabha elections.

At a news conference here on Sunday, Naidu said the BJP would like to be the first non-Congress government to complete five years in office. â€œThere was no thinking of early polls and hence no need for such speculation,â€� he said.

BJP sources said a section of the party had favoured early elections if the BJP wins in at least three out of the five states going to polls this month, but Prime Minister Vajpayee had rejected the proposal.

Asked to comment on the possibility of early polls in Andhra Pradesh, Naidu said his party would agree with the TDPâ€™s decision.

Venkaiah and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani had lunch with the chief minister at his residence and reportedly discussed state politics. Venkaiah would not divulge details: â€œYou know well we canâ€™t have lunch in silence. I contratulated him for conducting the Afro-Asian games and prayed for his speedy recovery.â€�

Naidu predicted a change in the political scenario after the assembly elections and said it would adversely affect the Congress party. Being a â€œdirection-less partyâ€� it might even disintegrate at some places, he claimed. He would not elaborate on the issue.

Asked to comment on BSP leader Mayawatiâ€™s statement that her party would prevent the BJP from coming to power, he said the BSP would meet the same fate as the Left parties.

He claimed that there was a gross misuse of central funds by the states going to polls and said the BJP would release these details before the elections.

He would not reply when asked if the BJP would release such details in Andhra Pradesh during the assembly elections here.

Naidu claimed that his party would win in at least three states, make an entry into Mizoram assembly, and put up a tough fight in Delhi.

8,Sewa Dal asked to gear up for polls,"PATNA: The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president, Ram Jatan Sinha, on Sunday called upon Sewa Dal members, including women in assembled in Patna on Sunday, to prepare themselves in a manner that they stand up to the fascist forces at polling booths during elections and on other occasions.

The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president was addressing the office-bearers of the Sewa Dal at its state-level meeting held in Sadaquat Ashram. The office-bearers of its various wings, including from the districts, participated in the meeting. Stating that the Sewa Dal constituted the backbone of the Congress, Sinha said that no pains should be spared to strengthen it at every level.

Since the All India Congress Committee (AICC) president, Sonia Gandhi, had reposed strong and unflinching faith in the activists of the Sewa Dal, the organisation should strive to work for social harmony at every polling booth in the state during the ensuing assembly elections polls, Sinha said. Speaking on the occasion, the Sewa Dal president, Pramode Pandey, announced a five-point programme to infuse new vigour in the state Sewa Dal.

Sinha said its members, adhering to the credo â€˜garva se kaho hum bharatiya hainâ€™, would strive to strengthen the Congress in the state. While the 200 Sewa Dal volunteers from the state would leave for campaigning in favour of the party candidates during the elections for the state assemblies in five states, the programme to strengthen Sewa Dal included holding the district-level camps in the state.

According to the state Sewa Dal organiser, Vashisth Narayan Tiwari, a ten-day state-level training camp would be organised in Katihar in the last week of December. Each of the district units in the state has been asked to send seven male and three female Sewa Dal members for the training.

9,"Gandhians float fresh agenda, new political party","PATNA: Well-meaning politicians and social workers on Sunday rallied behind former external affairs minister Shyam Nandan Mishra, a Gandhian, and floated a new political party â€˜Nai Shaktiâ€™ so as to give new direction to the stateâ€™s political and social life and also achieve cultural unity of people, otherwise divided by mutual mistrust.

While the avowed aim of the party is to start a popular struggle to achieve the declared objective, a 51-member steering committee, with Sachchidanand Sharma as its convener, was also constituted the same day to organise the popular struggle on Gandhian lines and inject new value system in the stateâ€™s politics.

The formation of the new party has occurred at a time when parliamentary and state assembly elections are not far off. Incidentally, ex-Rajya Sabha MP Ranjan Prasad Yadav, along with some other politicians, has also floated a new party, Sampoorna Vikas Dal recently. The adherents of the Nai Shakti insisted on providing new agenda for the people of the state. The constitution and policies of the Nai Shakti would be made public at a larger meeting to be convened later.

Its date would be announced in future, said Ravindra Ranjan, the Patna district board member, and Sharma. According to them, Mishra, who is known as a Gandhian, has been made patron of the new party. He would guide the steering committee and others involved in framing the new partyâ€™s constitution. Among those who took part in the deliberations organised on Sunday in the Legislatorsâ€™ Club that led to formation of the Nai Shakti were former ministers Nawal Kishore Shahi and Ramdeo Singh Yadav, ex-MLA Ghulam Hussain, Dr Ranjan Kumar and Shankar Sharan (retired IAS).

While leaders of various political parties, both of the ruling and opposition ranks, had failed to bring developmental agenda into the minds of the stateâ€™s people, they insisted, adding it alone had necessitated formation of Nai Shakti. The participants framed and announced four-point aim of the Nai Shakti. It included freeing the existing political situation from pollutants to bring about social, economic, moral and improved psychological state of the stateâ€™s people through sustained struggle and peopleâ€™s participation by peaceful means.

10,Rally against economic policy on November 4,"PATNA: Peasants and youths from eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal will assemble at Gandhi Maidan on November 4 for a rally against the new economic policy (NEP) and its adverse consequences on the people of the country, specially those who come from the poor sections of the society, said Kishan Patnaik of Samajwadi Jan Parishad (SJP).

He was addressing a press conference here on Sunday which was attended by SJP national president Binodanand Singh, vice president Jugalkishore Raiveer, state SJP chief Om Prakash and National Alliance of Peoplesâ€™ Movementâ€™s (NAPM) nominee Sanjay Mangla Gopal. Patnaik said the present day politics has gone out of the control of the common masses. â€œHence the masses, including people from the lower strata of the society and the lower middle class people, will have to come out on the streets. There is no other way of improvement,â€� he said.

â€œEmergence of new politicians is the demand of the time and for it people-oriented movements like Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) and civil society organisations, actively engaged in pursuing movements of civil rights at grassroot level across the country, would have to be brought into the forefront. They will have to field united candidates in elections for the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies,â€� Patnaik said. He said nowadays media is totally controlled by the elite classes and the issues, related to common masses and lower middle class society, is not covered by it.

â€œLaloo Prasad Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati, who claim to be the leaders of the backwards and Dalits, have become pro-rich and have gone against the interests of the downtrodden,â€� Patnaik said and added that within next two months a committee, led by Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, will convene a national-level meeting to decide future course of action.

11,Information minister gives information on crime rise,"PATNA: Chief minister Rabri Deviâ€™s outburst at the ruling RJDâ€™s national convention here in October that the achievements of the state government on the development and law and order fronts were not being publicised by the ministers appears to have had the desired effect on information and public relations minister Sitaram Yadav.

This was evident on Sunday when Yadav released a statement hailing the law and order position in the state. The law and order situation is much better in Bihar as compared to other states, he stressed. Quoting the data published in â€œCrime in Indiaâ€� in 2000, the minister said Bihar got the 23rd position so far as crimes were concerned while Delhi, Union territory of Chandigarh and Kerala got the first, second and third positions respectively.

Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu got the fifth, sixth and seventh positions respectively. He said the crime rate in Bihar during 1995-2000 was below the national average though for every one lakh population there were only 94 policemen in Bihar as against the national average of 129 policemen.

The crime rate per one lakh population in Bihar was 123.4 as against the national average of 176.7. The number of complaints per 100 policemen in Bihar was 0.1 as against the national average of 5.3, the minister added. The minister appealed to mediapersons to present the â€œreal pictureâ€� of Bihar at the national and international levels and cooperate with the state government in removing the â€œmisunderstandingâ€� about the state.

12,"Left, Trinamul blame game over violence at hospital","KOLKATA: Saturday nightâ€™s violence at R.G. Kar Hospital here has kicked off blame game between the ruling Left Front and the Opposition parties, with both claiming that the other had a hand in the event.

Leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee described the incident as a handiwork of Alimuddin Street. SUCI state secretary Prabhas Ghosh also held a similar opinion. Without naming the SFI, Trinamul leaders pointed fingers at the CPMâ€™s student arm and local activists.

â€œIt is a planned operation against the media that had exposed the mess in state hospitals. The health minister should step down. And so should the chief minister, because the rot could not have gone so deep in day,â€� said Banerjee.

The Trinamul will take out a rally from Subodh Mullick Square on Monday to protest against the attack on the media.

State CPM secretary Anil Biswas, however, claimed that the Trinamul and SUCI were behind the violence.

â€œTwo political parties have been conspiring against the government for long. Saturdayâ€™s violence was part of the game plan. We condemn the violence,â€� he said.

Earlier in the day, he had a discussion with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra on this matter.

â€œWe have asked our party units to mobilise public opinion against such disruptive efforts inside hospitals. But, no party member should enter the hospital compound.

The administration will take care of the situation within. I can only say that patients depend a lot on doctors. Therefore, they have a major responsibility and should take utmost care in treating patients,â€� said Biswas.

He deplored the way some doctors had roughed up mediapersons. On Sunday, the court denied bail to 12 SUCI activists who were rounded up by the police.

â€œCPM cadres led the charge in a bid to intimidate journalists who had unmasked the state of hospitals,â€� said Ghosh.

14,Shahnawaz's wife in Delhi election fray,"NEW DELHI: Union textile minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussainâ€™s wife, Renu Sharma, has been chosen to contest elections in Delhi by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) top brass.

BJP sources say Sharma is the ideal candidate for the Nasirpur assembly seat in outer Delhi. â€˜â€˜She is a popular schoolteacher, married to a Bihari Muslim cabinet minister, and will get the votes of BJP Hindu supporters. The sitting MLA is Bihari Congress leader Mahabal Misra,â€™â€™ said a source.

Hussain said: â€˜â€˜It is true that my wife has been offered a seat, but she has not made up her mind yet. We have young children, and if both of us join politics, it might cause some problems.â€™â€™

A BJP leader said considering Sharma for a ticket or Kirti Azadâ€™s wife, Poonam, for the Gole Market seat against chief minister Sheila Dikshit, reflected the strategy to give tickets to people who could win.

â€˜â€˜The only criteria is the candidateâ€™s winnability, and not keeping top leaders happy. We are fielding Muslims against Muslim candidates, Dalits against Dalits, and women against women to hit the Congress,â€™â€™ said a BJP leader.

The BJP is going to repeat most of the sitting MLAs as unlike the Congress, they are few in number. â€˜â€˜We hope the Congress repeats all its sitting MLAs and their tickets are divided between the supporters of Jagdish Tytler, Sajjan Kumar, Chaudhary Prem Singh and Dikshit. With no election wave, only the candidatesâ€™ merit and charisma will matter,â€™â€™ said a source.

In Nasirpur, Purvanchalis (people from Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh) hold the key as they account for 40 per cent of the votes. Muslims constitute six per cent of the votes. Punjabis account for another 40 per cent.

In the last elections, it was a close contest as Misra won by just 1,400 votes. He, however, seemed unperturbed. â€˜â€˜I know the BJP is selecting suitable candidates against Congress big guns like Sheila Dikshit, Chaudhary Prem Singh, Ajay Maken, Haroon Yusuf and A K Walia. Surprisingly, I, too, figure in the list,â€™â€™said Misra.

He said his work would be decisive and that he would win by at least 25,000 votes.

16,Jamia Milia tense as students clash,"NEW DELHI: Jamia Milia Islamia remained tense on Tuesday following incidents of stone pelting and heated exchanges between various student groups on Monday.

Different reasons for Mondayâ€™s outbreak are being cited by both the students and university authorities. While a group of students demanding revival of the studentsâ€™ union, say that unpleasant exchanges occurred when authorities tried to â€˜â€˜destabilise their process of peacefu protestsâ€™â€™, university authorities are denying the allegations.

They claim that the disturbance was initiated by some â€˜â€˜politically motivatedâ€™â€™ students to influence others who do not wish to be a part of the agitation.

Protesting students on the other hand claim that trouble started at about 4 pm when a group of â€˜â€˜outsidersâ€™â€™ interfered in the public meeting being held by students at the Ghalib statue inside the main campus.

â€˜â€˜We were to meet top university authorities on Monday but they refused to talk to us till Ramzan is over. A group of outsiders approached us later in the day and began to provoke students with snide remarks,â€™â€™ said a BA second year student.

The protesting students also allege that some university officials were present on the spot but did â€˜â€˜nothing to stop the violence.â€™â€™
