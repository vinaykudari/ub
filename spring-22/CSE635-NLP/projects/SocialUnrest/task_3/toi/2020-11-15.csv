0,Cold war heats up within DF govt,"MUMBAI: A major cold war is currently on between chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde and deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal even as the Special Investigating Team is preparing to turn the heat on politicians alleged to have been involved in the fake stamp-paper scam.

The differences between the two leaders of the Congress and the NCPâ€”alliance partners in the Maharashtra governmentâ€”became public recently when Shinde and Bhujbal traded charges, each accusing the other for the delay in appointing S M Shangari as director-general of police.

Last Tuesday, Shinde even hinted that he would like to sack his deputy, but that the compulsions of coalition politics prevented him from doing so.

The opposition has been demanding Bhujbalâ€™s removal for his handling of the probe into the scam. The cold war is being fought in the background of a sharp deterioration in ties between the Congress and the NCP.

While NCP president Sharad Pawar had mooted a pre-poll alliance between the two parties more than three months ago, the Congress is still to respond to his suggestion.Mr Pawar is reported to be smarting from the snub.

Bhujbal is apparently giving Shinde similar treatment by way of retaliation. The rift between Shinde and Bhujbal is likely to widen further following the report submitted by the SIT regarding Mumbai police commissioner R S Sharmaâ€™s alleged role in the Telgi scam.

Bhujbal would not like Mr Shinde to effect any change in the police force without his concurrence since he holds the home portfolio.

Sources in the DF ministry said that even if the new Mumbai police commissioner is selected amicably by the CM and his deputy, tensions within the government could continue to simmer until such time as the issue of a pre-poll alliance between the Congress and NCP is resolved.

â€œThe Congress is not in favour of pre-poll tie-up, the NCPâ€™s commitment to the DF government will certainly weaken,â€™â€™ an NCP activist said.

Pawar has already mooted the idea of floating a third front comprising parties opposed to both the BJP and the Congress.

1,"Caste holds key, not political colour at OU","HYDERABAD: The social life of students of Osmania University is often influenced by emerging political and caste differences.

However, of late, politics has taken a back seat and caste has emerged as the dominant factor on campus.

""Years back, students knew each other by their roll numbers, names and even merit. The only differences that existed were ideological. But today, caste has subordinated ideology, and has become more of an identity tag,"" says F D Vakil, professor of political science in the university. He is also the vicechairman of the AP Minorities Commission.

Vakil says it is nothing but a reflection of what''s happening outside the campus.

""The 90s brought this polarisation in caste and class, from which emerged a conflict of identities. Any student belonging to a minority group makes sure he becomes a member of the minority associations on campus. He doesn''t want to lose out on his rights,"" he said.

""Students must be recognised on the basis of merit. Often students find it hard to believe that one from an SC\ST group might actually fare well. Sometimes, meritorious students feel let down when the reservation card is flashed at them. There is no discrimination on grounds of caste, but caste consciousness definitely exists,"" says Mallika, an MSc student.

This also indirectly influences the social circles students move in. Mostly, students from the same caste tend to become friends easily and form groups.

An MPhil student, who lives at the OU hostel says: ""When students from the so-called backward communities get together to fight for a cause, somewhere there is a feeling that it is a fight against the upper castes, and an indifference emerges.""

""In the earlier days, the strong presence of Left and Right-leaning groups helped drown casteism. Things are different now,"" Vakil says.

But today, this has affected regular academics too. ""We are concentrating on our studies, but there is always the fear that even a petty dispute might snowball into a political issue,"" Mallika says.

The caste card is definitely used in appointing certain key functionaries,Vakil says. ""Today, probably the vicechancellor too has to make sure he has a proper representation of people from different castes in his team,"" he says. It is called the ""politics of accommodation"".

However, compared to other universities in the country, Osmania remains ""an island of virtues,"" he adds. Organising cultural programmes, a fellowship dinner for all the teachers of OU, student festivals, seminars and so on will certainly help bring students together. Many students agree that the impartial teaching faculty has been their moral strength.

2,NDA memo to CEO for fair bypolls,"PATNA: An NDA delegation led by its state president and railway minister Nitish Kumar met chief electoral officer N S Madhavan in his office on Saturday and requested him for immediate posting of officials at all the buildings where the polling stations of Fatuha, Sitamarhi and Barachatti assembly constituencies are located.

The posting would fecilitate in giving residential certificates to voters as an alternative to photo identity cards as had been done during the Babubarhi assembly by-elections because hardly 10 to 20 per cent of the voters of the state have got photo identity cards.

Madhavan assured the delegation that he would refer the matter to the Election Commission for necessary action. The other members of the delegation were state NDA convener Nand Kishore Yadav, Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha (both MLAs), Shivnandan Mishra, Lakshmi Sahu, Shyam Sundar Singh Dheeraj and Radhika Raman.

The delegation submitted a memorandum to Madhavan demanding permanent deployment of armed Central force at all the polling stations in the by-elections to be held for the Fatuha, Sitamarhi and Barachatti assembly seats on November 20 in order to ensure fair and peaceful polling.

The delegation demanded proper patrolling, particularly in the extremist-hit Ambatari, Sindhugarh, Gopalkhera, Latte and Lakhaipur villages of Mohanpur block in Barachatti assembly constituency, and special security arrangements at the polling stations in the villages.

The memorandum says the officials of police stations in the three constituencies should be kept away from the election work along with the BDOs, COs and magistrates posted in Patna, Sitamarhi and Gaya districts for more than three years. Meanwhile, the Patna district-level standing committee met here on Saturday. DM Deepak Prasad said this time votes would be cast through electronic voting machines for which officials have been trained.

3,CPM to back Cong in Assembly polls,"KOLKATA: The CPM central committee on Saturday endorsed former state chief minister Jyoti Basuâ€™s line of extending support to the Congress in the ensuing Assembly polls in five states, but with a rider.

To ensure the defeat of the BJP and its allies, the CPM would extend support to candidates of Left and secular parties in seats where it was not contesting, CPM politburo members Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechuri said. But the CPM will also uphold its own economic policies and â€œoppose some of the Congress policiesâ€�.

Karat ruled out the possibility of an electoral alliance with the Congress and left open the question of extending support to it in forming governments after the polls.

The three-day politburo and central committee meeting discussed specifically the stand of the party in the Andhra polls. â€œThe partyâ€™s stand in the Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Delhi polls was decided earlier. In Mizoram, we donâ€™t have a unit,â€� Karat said.

Making it clear that the CPM was equally keen to defeat the TDP in Andhra, as the BJP elsewhere, Karat said the battle against the TDP was â€œan important oneâ€�.

For, the TDP, on the one hand, was supporting the â€œcommunalâ€� BJP by being an NDA partner. On the other hand, it was â€œtaking the leadâ€� in pursuing the World Bank-sponsored policies of liberalisation and globalisation.

5,Men against violence,"LUCKNOW: Here are some men who believe ''chivalry'' begins at home. The real expression of ''manhood'' is not bashing one''s wife, but in fighting violence against women, they say.

Harish Sadani, an employee in a private company who also has the credit of starting ''Men Against Violence and Abuse'' (MAVA), the first ever men''s organisation in the country for fighting violence against women, feels that women should come out of the stereotypes, now traditionally defined, and set role of men required to be examined and changed.

In a lecture delivered at the Institute of Women Studies, Lucknow University, he told students that gender issues were not just women''s issues, they were equally important for men.

The event was organised by Men''s Action for Stopping Violence Against Women, a Lucknow-based organisation, which has formed a chain of ''like-minded men'' in the state to increase awareness.

6,"Opium, politics make for heady mix before polls","NEW DELHI: The lucrative monopoly of opium that the Mughals bequeathed to the the East India Company, the British Crown and, eventually, independent India is finally ending.

On November 6, the Union cabinet decided to privatise the processing of opium, the drug that brought the Chinese empire to its knees. The government will soon allow Indian or foreign pharma companies to buy opium from the government to produce pain-killers.

Once the bane of a civilisation, derivatives of opium grown legally in 11 countries like India and Australia - morphine, codeine and thebaine - are used to provide relief to terminally ill cancer and HIV patients.

But it remains to be seen how the government will ensure that privatisation does not encourage the production of the more lucrative and illegal opium derivative - heroin. What has surprised experts is the speed and secrecy with which the decision was taken.

In 1994, a few officials tried to get the pharma sector into opium processing but failed because pharma majors shied away from the stringent provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, which even led to a fall in the countryâ€™s lawful morphine consumption.

No pharma company wanted to invest Rs 100 crore and have enforcement agencies seeking accounts for every gram of opium used.

If the move is hardly likely to benefit pharma majors, what prompted this quiet and swift decision? Itâ€™s the poll factor.

Two of the three opium growing states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh - are going to the polls on December 1. The political interests of finance minister Jaswant Singh, who piloted this proposal in the Union cabinet, and Rajasthan BJP president Vasundhara Raje Scindia lie in the opium-growing areas.

A glut in the world market has left a huge pile-up of opium inventory in the Government Opium and Alkaloid Factories (GOAF). India produces around 750 tonnes of legitimate opium in the three states.

Of it, over 500 tonnes were exported as raw opium to processing firms abroad. But with international majors farming and manufacturing opium on a much larger scale in Australia, the India opium is facing stiff competition even as a raw product.

Moreover, the GOAF in Ghazipur and Neemuch ran on ancient technology until recently. The one in Ghazipur was set up by the East India Company in 1820 and is getting upgraded only this year. Without considerable investment in GOAF, opening up the sector was the only way to have cheaper opiates for medical use.

7,Any action in stamp scam after consulting state govt: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Sunday said the Centre will decide on the action to be taken in the multi-crore stamp paper scam in Maharashtra after talks with the state government.

""If we have to do something it will on the basis of talks with the Maharashtra government,"" Advani said here after a 30-minute meeting with state Governor Mohammed Fazal.

He said Fazal did refer to the scam during the meeting but more important was ""what the state government says on the issue"".

""I have not asked for any report on the scam from the governor,"" Advani said, adding he kept submitting reports from time to time.

The governor also discussed the possible Central assistance to tackle drought in 10 districts of the state, Advani added.

Now both the issues will be directly taken up with the chief minister or home minister of the state, he said.

Advani said he had not demanded a CBI inquiry into the scam. ""CBI is already looking into the matter on the request of Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat. Its chief is on record stating if other states ask the investigating agency, it will take up their requests as well"".

The Deputy Prime Minister said Fazal had primarily paid a visit to bless his son and daughter-in-law as he had been unable to attend their recent wedding.

8,"Advani to talk to Assam, Bihar govt to reduce tension","NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Sunday said he will talk to both Assam and Bihar governments in a bid to reduce tensions over the alleged denial to Bihari students from appearing in Railway recruitment tests in the north-eastern state.

""I had gone to Arunachal Pradesh yesterday. I will now talk to both Assam and Bihar to ensure that the tension created between them are removed,"" Advani said here during an interaction with women students from Bihar.

He was responding to a question from a student of Patna Women''s College who enquired about the steps being taken to ensure security of female students from Bihar who may visit Assam in future.

Students from Bihar, agitated over being denied appearance in the examination had last week assaulted around thirty passengers after stopping two trains at the Jamalpur railway station.

The agitated students, armed with lathis, stopped the 4024 down Mahananda Express and 4055 Brahmaputra Mail at the station and beat up Assamese passengers.

Railway Recruitment Board is on Sunday holding the second round of examination for Group-D posts for students who could not appear in the test in Assam on November 9.
