0,"More arrests in rape, murder cases likely","AHMEDABAD: After the first arrest in the Kausar Bano case following the uproar in Parliament, the crime branch is expected to arrests some more persons in connection with rape and murder during the riots.

Sources said the arrest of a bus driver in the infamous case of Kausar Bano''s rape and murder was just the beginning. Four other cases with rape and murder charges have also been registered by the city''s crime branch against the accused named in various FIRs lodged by riot-victims. ""Offences have been recorded after investigations have proved that those accused had instigated the mob, were on the spot and had even taken lead in the rape, murder and loot,"" said sources.

The prime accused in the Kausar Bano case, which was part of the Naroda-Patia massacre, Ratilal Rathod alias Bhavani Singh, was arrested by the city crime branch late on Monday night. Rathod is 50 years old and works with the Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service as a driver. This is the first riot-arrest made in the city on charges of rape and murder.

On Monday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Vajpayee stating that a separate FIR be filed in this case and the investigations be done by the CBI. She had also taken objection to the remark of union defence minister George Fernandes in parliament in which he had allegedly tried to trivialise the rape cases as ""nothing unusual.""

The arrest of Rathod comes 11 weeks after the incident shook the city. The arrest was based on the incident''s sole eye-witness, Jannatbibi Kalubhai Hidubhai Shaikh, who claimed to have seen the eight-month pregnant Kausar Bano being raped and murdered.

Shaikh''s complaint was included in the same FIR 100/2002 of Naroda-Patia only on May 2 and section 376 (rape) was roped in. Eighty-six persons had been hacked and then burnt alive during the Naroda-Patia slaughter.

Rathod''s son is a lawyer and they reside in the Gangotri society''s first house located just where Jawannagar ends. Kausar Bano lived in Jawannagar in Naroda-Patia.

""I had approached the police time and again but leave alone lodging an FIR, the investigating officer did not even wish to take note of my narration,"" Jannat bibi is heard as having said. Sources said the matter was hastened after Sonia Gandhi''s letter to Vajpayee.

For over two months after the incident occurred on February 28, a police inquiry, headed by an additional police commissioner of the city, had remained inconclusive. The Naroda-Patia, an area which houses around 800 residential quarters, case had later drawn in no less than 756 FIRs of which 598 were registered by eye-witnesses and riot-victims sheltered in different relief camps like those at Shah-e-Alam Roza and Dariakhan Ghummat.

Sonia, during her visit to Ahmedabad and Godhra soon after riots along with an all-party delegation on a fact-finding mission, was not allowed to visit the relief camp at Shah-e-Alam Roza lest such matters get ""blown out of proportion.""

2,Briton confirmed dead in state riots,"MUMBAI: Saeed Dawood, one of the two British nationals missing from Gujarat since February, has been declared dead after DNA samples recovered from bone fragments found near the site where they were attacked by a mob, matched with a blood sample of his mother. The Hyderabad-based forensic science laboratory submitted its report to the British High Commission on May 8. The bone samples found in an abandoned factory near Prantij, where Saeed and three other British nationals were attacked.

They were sent for analysis on March 28, exactly a month after the gruesome incident occurred on February 28.

The four British nationals, Saeed Dawood (42), Sakil Dawood (37), Mohamad Aswat (42) and Imran Dawood (18) were travelling to Surat on national highway-8 when their car was attacked by a mob at Prantij, 70-kms from Ahmedabad. While Aswat''s battered body was found in a field alongside an injured Imran, the other two, Saeed and Sakil, could not be traced. Imran was flown back to the United Kingdom (UK) while Aswat was buried in a village near Surat.

For the West Yorkshire-based Dawood family the search for Saeed may have ended but not the agony. Talking to TNN from the UK Yusuf Dawood, Saeed''s youngest brother, said the family was still to receive a copy of the DNA report. ``News has trickled in but we will wait till we have the report in our hands,'''' he said.

Yusuf Dawood (29), had flown down to Mumbai in April to search for his brothers. His family had banned him from entering Gujarat but he ensured that his men visited each and every relief camp there and distributed the missing persons'' pictures.

The authorities, however, were not very forthcoming and the slack handling of the case by the Gujarat police received criticism not only from India but also abroad. British prime minister Tony Blair had expressed his concern over the killings and the international media had highlighted this story. The Dawood family was even considering moving the British court to try Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi for his `complicity'' with the killings.

Having engaged the services of city-based criminal lawyer Majeed Memon, the Dawood family has sent out appeals to President K.R. Narayanan and prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee seeking a transfer of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI).

The family also hopes to bring the people, who have carried out the heinous act, to book. In a letter dated May 3 special inspector general of police, Gujarat, M. O. Khimani told the BHC that six persons suspected to be involved in the attack on the British national had been arrested. The letter further added, ``Our officer has received information through reliable sources that the accused persons have murdered the missing British Citizens and disposed off the dead bodies. However, the information is not confirmed by the independent evidence of any eye witness''''.

While the DNA report seems to have sealed Saeed''s fate, the search for Sakil is still on.

3,Citizens' tribunal claims of damning evidence on riots,"AHMEDABAD: The Concerned Citizens'' Tribunal, which consists of several eminent retired jurists probing into the communal violence in Gujarat, has said it has received inside information on how the Bajrang Dal and VHP allegedly targeted Muslims in the state.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, members of the tribunal, comprising retired judges and well-known social activists, said former Bajrang Dal activists have deposed before them giving details of the modus operandi and the planning that went behind the riots.

""Some former Bajrang Dal insiders have given us information on how the riots were planned,"" said justice (retd) P B Sawant, a former Supreme Court judge. ""According to them, preparations of these riots were made at least six to eight months in advance.""

The tribunal says in an official release, ""Evidence has been received accusing the VHP and Bajrang Dal of recruiting volunteers, training them in the use of arms and ammunition, collecting information about houses, shops and other business establishments of the minority community and effectively using them in the violence.""

The judges, however, refused to draw any conclusions immediately as they have just completed recording evidence and testimonies. Their analysis and conclusions will come first in their interim report followed by a final report by August 15. They will send a tentative report to the state government for its reaction on their findings after which the final report will be prepared. ""If the government does not respond, we will take it that they have nothing to say.""

Although the state government is not legally bound to respond to the findings, it assumes importance as it has legal luminaries like justice (retd) V R Krishna Iyer in it. He had joined the tribunal during its first two days of recording evidence and testimonies and is expected to make a significant contribution to the final report.

Among other members are former Bombay High Court judge justice Hosbet Suresh, PUCL president K G Kannabiran, Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Ghanshyam Shah, historian Tarika Sarkar and former IAS officer Aruna Roy.

The tribunal''s case has also been strengthened by depositions of senior IPS and IAS officers whose identities have been concealed. They are believed to have corroborated much of the evidence that has been collected. More than 1,500 persons from a cross-section of society have deposed before the tribunal so far.

Reserving their observations for the final report, they did give some insight into what to expect once it is ready. While the National Commission for Women almost gave the state government a clean chit, justice Suresh and justice Sawant said they believe at least 250 women were raped and murdered in the initial days of violence. They also held special hearings for women at Vadodara and recorded evidence of police brutality against them.

Against the 900-plus official death toll of the state government, the tribunal members believe the number is more than 2,000. Of these, 500 are missing with their bodies yet to be recovered.

4,"Now, govt ropes in RWAs, NGOs to run its schools","NEW DELHI: After local civic issues, it is educationâ€™s turn. Extending the concept of Bhagidari to schooling, the Delhi state government has constituted students welfare committees consisting of residents welfare associations, voluntary groups and parent-teacher associations.

Announcing this at a Bhagidari workshop on Tuesday, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said the committees would have to improve academics, infrastructure, sanitation and co-curricular activities in government schools.

The government will give financial powers to these committees. Compared with the present annual grant of Rs 25,000 received by the head of a government school, now each of these committee will be able to spend Rs 10,000 per month.

Fifty-five committees have already been formed and a 100 more will be set up soon. â€˜â€˜The education department and agencies like public works department will have to give priority to reports submitted by the committees,â€™â€™ education secretary Gita Sagar said.

Dikshit said although the government spends Rs 850 per month on every student, including supplying uniforms and textbooks, the benefits do not reach them. There are schools which do not have basic facilities such as toilets, water and fans. Boundary walls are broken and students and teachers are missing.

Now, the welfare committees will have to act as watchdogs and ensure that government schemes are implemented. The committees will also have to ensure that schools take initiative in co-curricular activities, value education and environment awareness.

Participants in the Bhagidari workshop, however, said the government would have to rethink some of its policies. â€˜â€˜They talk of co-curricular activities, but 265 posts for physical education and yoga teachers were slashed last month,â€™â€™ said Farid Ahmed, committee chairman of Government Girls Senior Secondary School in Bulbuli Khana.

A few students present at the workshop said shortage of teachers and poor attendance were rampant. â€˜â€˜Most of the times, our teachers are caught up with surveys and census,â€™â€™ a student from Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Rajouri Garden, alleged.

Education minister Rajkumar Chauhan said the government was planning to provide computers in all senior secondary schools. It is also holding talks with the tourism department to be able to organise local picnics for schoolchildren.

5,"Road accidents fewer, thanks to 11 pm deadline","HYDERABAD: With strict enforcement of the 11 pm deadline for closing all shops, commercial establishments, bars and restaurants, the number of night time road accidents has fallen by more than 90 per cent during the past two weeks in the city.

Earlier, on an average, 20 to 25 accidents used occur in the between 11 pm and 6 am on any given night. But after the enforcement of the 11 pm closure deadline, there have been only five accidents from May 1 to 12. The accidents happened under the Banjara Hills, Saifabad, Gopalpuram, Saidabad, Chikkadpally police station limits.

One of the main reasons for these accidents is drunken and rash driving, city police commissioner M V Krishna Rao told The Times of India on Monday. Except in the case of the incident at Saifabad where the victim was a 42-year-old person, the other victims were in their early 20s.

â€œAnd these can be avoided if all the commercial establishments, restaurants, bars and shops are strictly closed by 11 pm,â€� he said.

The deadline has also made monitoring of roads at nights more effective.

The city, as well as the traffic police, have increased night patrolling, Krishna Rao said.

â€œNow that most establishments are shut by 11 pm, we will be more stringent about the deadline hereafter,â€� he said.

Another area that the police will be concentrating on, is the removal of vehicles parked in the â€˜no-parking zoneâ€™.

â€œOur personnel is striving to curtail the parking violations. Despite best of its efforts, our department is still way behind the mark,â€� he said. One can not say only private vehicles flout the rules.

Unfortunately, even government vehicles too violate parking rules, the police commissioner said.

The police is also considering sending more number of personnel to the traffic police wing to improve its performance and crack down on the erring citizens, Krishna Rao said.

6,State updates pvt partner policy,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government is preparing a policy document on public-private partnership (PPP) in infrastructure development, West Bengal urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya announced on Tuesday.The minister was speaking at an interactive session with members of the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce in Kolkata.

Das said.Till now, most of the PPP projects have been in the housing sector, the two significant ones being the Rs 130 crore-Hiland Park project and the Rs 80-crore Salt Lake City Centre. A lot of companies have been showing interest in roads and flyovers. A flyover on the Eastern Bypass and parts of the proposed Eastern Ex-pressway, connecting the Bypass with North 24 Parganas bypassing Salt Lake, are also proposed to be built on PPP, Bhattacharya said. Chamber president Sunil Kanoria suggested that the government convert land at Salt Lake from leasehold to freehold, as vast tracts have been lying unused. A similar step has been taken by the Delhi Development Authority, he said. Bhattacharya said that the proposal is now with the state government and it is actively considering it. We are studying the Delhi model along with those in other cities. We will come to a decision soon, Das said.

7,New faces sweep Motihari polls,"C B PANDEYMOTIHARI: Out of 28 wards of the Motihari municipality, 27 have been captured by new faces, mainly youths. There are 10 women among those elected who have no prior experience of the working and management of local bodies. Although new entrants to the civic body, they seem to be flamboyant, promising all round improvement in the historical town.The election has thrown up many upsets. Only one former ward commissioner Harishanker Prasad has come out victorious from ward no. 3 whereas about a dozen former chairmen and ward commissioners have tasted defeat. About two dozen contestants have secured between 0 to 20 votes. Two contestants have lost with the margin of only one vote.As many as 272 candidates were in the fray who, irrespective of their victory or defeat, are all praise for the district magistrate cum district election officer S Seokumar for his transparent and fair conduct of election as well as faultless and foolproof counting of votes. The electorate, too, praise the district administration for the fair election.The highlight of the election is that besides two Dalits elected from the seats reserved for scheduled castes, one Dalit contestant Rajkumar Paswan has registered victory from a general seat of ward no 3. Although caste played a crucial role in this election too, one Rekha Sharma has come out victorious from ward no 6 despite the fact that there are only four votes of her caste in that ward. Rekha, a private school teacher, had been taking keen interest in the developmental works since long.However, a large number of doctors, lecturers, advocates, traders and other intellectuals did not take part in the elections. One of those elected has criminal background. In 10 wards, the husbands of women contestants managed the election campaign.After the announcement of the results, the talk of the town is who would be the chairman of the municipality. The leaders of various political parties are busy with permutations and combinations to capture the post of chairman.Meanwhile, over 250 employees of the municipality have not been paid salaries for the last 44 months.

10,Mulayam meets PM over Presidential polls,"NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav on Wednesday met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, apparently as part of consultations on the ensuing Presidential elections.

The 30-minute meeting took place a few days after NDA authorised Vajpayee to take a decision on the Presidential candidate, sources said.

It was not known if any issue other than the Presidential election figured at the meeting.

The BJP is understood to have zeroed down on P C Alexander as its candidate for the top post. The prospects of a consensus on the next President are unlikely with the Congress and the Left indicating support for incumbent K R Narayanan.

The Presidential election was likely to be held in mid-July and the notification for it was expected on July 9 or 10, the sources said.

11,Black Tuesday was a close call for incubator babies,"BANGALORE: Grid-tripping has its worst impact on hospitals. Power, the lifeline for critical care units, ICUs, operation theatres and nurseries, is rationed through generators. What happens when on a day of power outage, generators fail and the back-up system gives way?

Like it happened on Tuesday at one of Bangalore''s reputed hospitals. Here, 21 infants were lying in incubators. For the entire city, it was a phase out of electricity, but for these newborns, it was almost the phase out of life itself.

Another few minutes, and these infants would have lost their tiny grip on life. It was one of the worst cases of power cuts affecting hospitals, though swift measures taken by the authorities ensured that the little ones came through. Had the infants been in any of the government hospitals, one wonders what the result could have been, shudders one doctor.

The hospital was plunged into darkness from morning to evening due to constant power disruption. The generators failed to function as they had developed a technical snag. Worse, the generator back-up which takes care of critical services such as operation theatres and incubators had also conked out.

The incubators holding the newborns could not keep up their normal pace of working. According to hospital sources, if power had not resumed in those ``crucial 30 minutes, anything could have happened to the babies''''.

Work on the generators was taken up on a war-footing and the back-up power supply finally cranked up.

``Never in the past has the hospital faced such acute power problems. This time, the failure of generators created complications. Patients were worked up as the hospital was in darkness, and fans and the air-conditioning did not function,"" hospital sources said.

All''s well that ends well for the babies, initiated though they were into our `power''less world of outages and darkness.

12,Muthappa Rai arrested in Dubai,"BANGALORE: Underworld don Muthappa Rai, who fled the country in 1996 and is wanted in several murders here, was arrested in Dubai on Monday night with his wife and 10-year-old daughter.

Confirming his arrest, a Rai aide on Wednesday said: ``It is a routine matter. He has been picked up for immigration checking involving a fake passport. He will be released in another two hours.""

Reacting to Rai''s arrest in Dubai, Police Commissioner H.T. Sangliana got in touch with the CBI Director and through him alerted the Interpol for seeking Rai''s deportation. He also got in touch with Indian Embassy in UAE and requested them to prevail upon the Dubai police to send Rai back here. A request from Bangalore police to extradite Rai is pending with Dubai police since 1997.

The Bangalore police had arrested Rai in 1992. But his fingerprints, considered important for his extradition, are not available.

A detailed request in this regard was mailed to Indian embassy with the recent photographs of Rai and a Red Corner notice against him.

Giving an account of Rai''s arrest, his aide told The Times of India: ""I received a call from Rai on Sunday. He said he had returned to Dubai on the same day after a trip to Egypt, Spain, Kenya, Uganda and Switzerland. He attended a party on Monday and met a VVIP from Karnataka there. When he returned home, the Dubai police were waiting for him at his house.''''

On a tip-off that he possesses a fake passport, the police picked him up along with his wife and daughter. However, his whereabouts are not known. Both his mobile and satellite phones are switched off, the aide said.

""A team will be despatched to Dubai if necessary to bring Rai back,"" Sangliana said.
