1,HC quashes arrest of Pakistani,"new delhi: the delhi high court has ordered the quashing of the arrest of a pakistani businessman pending an extradition request from the pakistani government. a division bench of justice usha mehra and justice c k mahajan also directed the union government to return the passport to petitioner sayed tahir hussain, who was arrested on may 4 by the police following a red-corner alert by the interpol. challenging his arrest and extradition proceedings, hussain's lawyer sidharth luthra argued the basis of his arrest was wrong because no extradition treaty existed between the two countries. ``a red-corner notice of the interpol is of no consequence in the absence of an extradition provision between the two countries,'' luthra said. explaining the union government's position on hussain's detention, additional solicitor-general k k sud admitted before the court: ``at the time of arrest (of hussain) there was no treaty between the countries, although there is a subsequent arrest for extradition (by the pakistani government on may 26, 2001) but no notification (for enquiry/extradition) has been issued by the government, nor it is likely to be issued.'' hussain was detained by the police under section 41(1)g of the criminal procedure code which allows a police officer to arrest, without an order from the magistrate or a warrant, any person in india who is accused of any offence outside india and is liable to be detained under an extradition treaty. but when no extradition request from pakistan followed the arrest of hussain here, the additional chief metropolitan magistrate on may 16 released him on bail but imposed stringent conditions, that: * he will not leave india without court's permission and disclose his passport, * mark his attendance every working day in the court, * keep court informed of his latest residential address in india, and * delhi police would have a right to keep a surveillance on him. a close friend of bhutto, hussain has been heading schon group of companies -- a conglomerate of companies is engaged in the field of banking, fertilisers, polyesters, textiles and export=import and having assets worth rs 2 billion in pakistan. in 1992 hussain took over state-run national fibers limited following disinvestment of several government-run companies in the country. according to his lawyer, after bhutto's pakistan people's party lost to sharif's muslim league in 1992, the petitioner come under a host of politically-motivated enquiries.

""we never noticed that the flag did not have the required number of spokes and the flag was hoisted every year for the last five years,"" a teacher of the school, said. the staff of the government upper school at banjara hills cancelled the flag hoisting as they did not find the flag which was kept at a place in the school after the flag hoisting on january 26. the flag which was hoisted at the government girls high school at hyderguda was a tricolour no doubt but certainly not the national flag. the three colours of the flag were red, white and saffron. ""the principal of the school noticed the colours only when the flag was unfurled,"" a student of the school. however, even after noticing the fault the flag was not replaced.

16,Archaic railway laws fail to handle encroachments,"pathankot: ineffective railway laws and the railway board's inability to issue clear-cut guidelines is causing a loss of revenue to the pathankot railway station. while the authorities concerned are turning a blind eye to the encroachments which are increasing by the day, the management's resorting to permit system and its inability to float tenders for the taxi stand is causing loss worth lakhs of rupees to the railways. according to railway sources, there is slackness in the administration, so much so, that it has failed to implement the railway's decision to prohibit the sale of cigarettes in the railway station premises.

""the lists are almost complete. we held them back in view of the panchayat raj and gram sarpanch elections as release of lists might lead to some discontent. we wanted the party to be united for the elections,"" he said. mirdha, however, admitted that there was some `losing of steam' in the party election process that began on a promising note.

19,Demand for vanilla revives hopes of farmers,"mangalore: there's still hope for beleaguered farmers in districts of dakshina kannada, uttara kannada, udupi, chikmagalur and shimoga, hit by a crash in prices of commercial crops like arecanut, coconut and coffee. the increased demand for vanillin from vegetative sources and rising vanilla prices in the world market is soothing for farmers. the crisis has been attributed to the one-crop pattern adopted by the farmers instead of inter-cropping, which will ensure assured returns in case one crop fails. when areca prices were low in the 70s, farmers resorted to inter-cropping for cocoa. but when areca prices shot up, interest in cocoa waned and inter-cropping aborted. syndicate bank has launched a scheme for financing the development of vanilla in these districts due to increased demand, and rise in the prices. the bank launched the scheme with a twin objective __ providing healthy crop diversification and increasing the farm income through mixed/inter-cropping and encourage vanillin production to meet the domestic and export demand. former managing director of campco, pramod kumar rai, told this newspaper it was time farmers employed inter-cropping as the price slump was continuing. ``there is no other alternative and vanilla is a good inter-crop.'' he also said puttur farmers were using `pachouli' (a medicinal, aromatic plant), as an inter-crop. vanilla, a tropical orchid, is a high-value spices crop used as a flavouring agent in chocolates, ice creams, soft drinks, pharmaceuticals, bakery products and perfumes. vanilla grows well in warm climate with an annual rainfall of 150-300 cm and in sandy loam to laterite soil, up to an elevation of i500 mts above mean sea level (msl). the crop flourishes in partial shade of 50 per cent sunlight. the vine establishes well with the help of supporting host plant and attains flowering stage after three years of planting. though flower is bi-sexual, natural pollination doesn't take place due to certain natural obstruction. therefore, hand pollination has to be resorted to. successfully pollinated flowers develop into pods and ready for harvest 7-8 months after pollination. pods can be harvested when their tip turns pale yellow colour. they are cured to obtain desired aroma/flavour. according to estimates, 500 vanilla plants can be grown as mixed crop on one acre of land. the total capital cost for mixed planting is rs 73,000 an acre, with the average cost of development at rs 146 per plant. the economic life of a vanilla plant is 15 years. a middle-aged plantation can yield up to 4 kg of green pods per plant per annum. the green pods and cured beans are available for rs 250 and rs 3,000 per kg respectively. if the farmers can sell green pods at rs 125 per kg, he can make a profit of rs 1 lakh per annum per acre from sixth year onwards. as far as linkages are concerned, the vanilla growers organisations, district horticultural departments and spices board provide raw material, technical know-how for cultivation/ processing, and marketing the produce in udupi, dakshina kannada and shimoga districts. spices board is implementing various incentive-linked programmes to promote vanilla production for exports. horticulture department has drawn up an ambitious plan to promote vanilla cultivation in the state. for more details on finance, contact branches of syndicate bank.
