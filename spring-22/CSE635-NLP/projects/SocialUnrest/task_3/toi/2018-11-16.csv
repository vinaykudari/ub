2,Trinamul fracas over coveted party post,"kolkata: groupism has raised its vociferous head just as the trinamul congress gears up to elect its state party president on november 19. rebel leader ajit panja has already branded these elections as illegal. for the time being, outgoing state trinamul president subrata bakshi will probably get party supremo mamata banerjee's nod , the second time. speaking to tnn, trinamul general secretary and principal returning officer mukul roy said that the party has not received any other nomination. a section of trinamul leaders are, however, peeved with bakshi as a choice. they insist that enjoying didi's confidence and hailing from south kolkata seemed to be the only criteria. those close to subrata mukherjee and congress leader priya ranjan das munshi also do not stand a chance, rues a now-out-of-favour mamata loyalist. as a result, leaders with mass base are getting marginalised in the party, says the trinamul leader. on the other hand, the panja camp feels that a farce has been enacted in the name of organisational elections. though mamata-loyalists have claimed to have gone on a membership drive, the rebel camp alleges that most of them are bogus members. mukul roy has strongly refuted the charges. he said that the trinamul had formed district committeess. can any faction say that they have not been represented in the district committees? roy challenged. on the question elected district and state committees, roy said that the party leadership is concentrating on building consensus within the organisation. if i can build consensus, the question of voting does not arise, mukul roy said. mamata banerjee's crisis manager partha chatterjee also criticised panja's recent comments comparing the elections to a 'circus.' chatterjee felt that panja was simply running out of comrades. if he is so concerned about democratic processes, he should resign and face fresh elections, chatterjee said.

3,Occupancy in RTC buses increasing,"warangal: gradually but quite optimistically the passenger occupancy ratio in the rtc rural services is picking up to the average levels in the warangal and karimnagar districts during the last one week. commuters in the rural parts who faced hardships due to the 25 day-strike by employees are relying on the prime mode of transport again. the deepavali season has brought back the needed normalcy in the transport sector and the twenty odd bus depots operating services in warangal, karimnagar and khammam districts recorded moderate to average occupancy levels during the period. though private transport operators posed a serious challenge to the interior routes in the initial stages of post strike operations, the semi urban and main road transport network received popular support from the day of resumption of bus services. occupancy ratio in the urban services however is still challenged by the three wheelers and autos in warangal city limits. here the eighty odd local services are running skeleton services during the odd hours. students and employees are relying on the rtc services during the peak hours and an unofficial survey conducted on the occupancy ratio by an ngo operating in the warangal town limits expressed fears that the moderate occupancy in the city services may result in further curtailing of operations in the town. ""for the last six months the decline in the occupancy ratio in the city buses led to the curtailment of services in the town and the ratio minimised further in this part,"" the survey observed. on the rural service network, the survey said the occupancy ratio is increasing day by day in the region. in karimnagar and warangal the interior services are helping the rtc to maintain the occupancy averages on par with other zones. in khammam too the semi urban and urban routes connecting the district headquarters are helping the rtc to maintain the occupancy levels, it opined. even the officials of rtc say the occupancy levels are likely to increase in the rural routes of this zone. however, the employees and staff unions feel that reducing the number of private operators is the need of the hour for maintaining the existing occupancy levels.they opine that the ratio may reach the record levels if the jeeps and private modes of transport are controlled with a positive will. daman and nicobar command chief admiral arun prakash, southern command chief g s sihota and air marshal m s sekhon of the southern air command.

9,Congress to oppose terror law in Parliament,"new delhi: clearly drawing battlelines for the winter session of parliament beginning next week, the congress on friday asserted it would oppose the prevention of terrorism ordinance in any form. party spokesman jaipal reddy sought to make clear the congress stand on the issue saying: ""our stand is unchanged and undiluted. we will oppose poto, the bill or amendments."" he also ruled out a change of mind if certain amendments were made, quipping: ""if all the amendments we want are carried out, there will be no poto left."" opposition parties have been up in arms against the new ordinance that replaces tada, criticising it as being even more draconian. while the communist parties have been extremely vocal in their protest against the proposed law, the congress opposition has hitherto been more muted. this is mainly because its opposition to the bill has been blunted by the fact that states it rules, like maharashtra and karnataka, have or are in the process of enacting similar laws. the bharatiya janata party-led government, on its part, is firm on going ahead with poto, accusing the opposition parties of trying to scuttle a move to check terrorism for political ends. reddy said the congress had studied poto much better than home minister l k advani seemed to have. ""he's not read it - if he had, he wouldn't have supported it,"" he contended. congress president sonia gandhi is meeting chief ministers of her party later in the evening to discuss the stand on poto, which is likely to dominate parliament proceedings in the winter session beginning on monday. reddy, however, denied that the congress meeting would focus on poto, saying it would be only one of the issues discussed. the chief ministers are in the capital to attend an inter-state council meeting. the congress has also demanded a ban on the bajrang dal, dramatically unveiling a pocket-sized ""trishul"" that it claimed was being distributed by the bajrang dal in lakhs in north india. congress spokesman anand sharma demanded that the sangh parivar outfit be ""banned immediately under the prevention of unlawful activities act, 1967, for carrying out a dangerous agenda of venom and hatred"". accusing the bajrang dal of distributing weapons to create communal tension in the name of religion, sharma said congress workers had brought this to the notice of the party high command. the ""trishul"", encased in a cover that bears a legend saying there will be no rest till the work of ram is complete, was recovered from rajasthan, sharma said. displaying the ""trishul"", senior spokesman jaipal reddy pointed out that it was ""sharp enough to cause fatal injuries"" and was cleverly sized within permissible limits. terming it a challenge to the legal and democratic system of the country, the congress alleged that the distribution of such ""weapons"" was part of the exercise launched by the sangh parivar to mobilise support towards beginning to build a ram temple from march next year in ayodhya. its waning popularity had made the sangh take recourse again to drumming up communal sentiments, sharma said. reddy pointed out that the home minister had given a clean chit to the same bajrang dal when christian missionary dr graham steins was burnt alive along with his sons in orissa. the party spokesman was, however, immediately on the defensive when asked what action the congress government in rajasthan was taking on having recovered the ""trishul"" there. pressed for an answer he said: ""the bajrang dal has launched its movement in various states. if action is taken in one state alone, it will not be effective."" he promised that the ashok gehlot government in rajasthan would take appropriate action and preventive steps ""at the right time.""

10,HUDCO to propose slew of fiscal incentives,"new delhi: housing & urban development corporation would propose a slew of fiscal incentives including extension of time-limit for tax deduction on repayments of housing loans and setting up a 'shelter development fund' in the forthcoming budget. hudco would propose to the central government to ma deposits/bonds of housing finance companies eligible for investments by provident and pension funds and permitting fdi into the sector under a proper regulatory regime. hudco, housing finance companies and industry chambers are expected to submit a detailed proposal to the government on november 19 during a ficci organised national conclave on stimulating housing sector, official sources said here on friday. hudco would also propose that the time limit for tax deduction on repayments of housing loans, should be extended to cover all housing purchased or completed up to year 2010. referring to the government's aim to attain 'housing for all' by 2010, hudco will propose removal of internal ceiling of rs 20,000 for the principal repayment of housing loan. hudco said this was because the borrower's capacity to invest in other qualifying investments was limited during the period of repayment housing loans. hudco will also suggest benefits to all enterprises and financial institutions in such enterprises for investing in infrastructure including housing - both new and existing. hudco said there was a need to simplify the relevant sections of infrastructure by reviewing the impeding conditionalities. hudco in its recommendations has also mentioned setting up a 'shelter development fund' through a levy on high income group housing and said proceeds of the fund could be utilised for training and capacity building of construction workers as well as providing housing to the poor at subsidised rates. hudco said in order to enhance flow of resources to the housing and real estate sector, the government needs to consider permitting hfcs to set up real estate mutual funds with adequate safeguards. this would help not only in channelising resources for the housing sector but also reduce the volatility in the real estate market, it said. hudco will also ask for industry status for the housing sector which it said will enable the builders to avail easy resources from banks and fis.

""we made changes in the law but it seems that it needs to be more strong so that the guilty can be punished severely,"" he said. the local police claim that the promoter had filled up a 15-bigha section of the waterbody within a fortnight. locals say this is absurd and the filling was going on for the past six months. they point to a politician-promoter nexus. strangely, there is no record of 45-bigha 'daktar bheri' with the district land records office. sheikh abdul hossain, officer-in-charge, land records office of north 24-parganas, said, ""after initial investigation in dhapa manpur mouza, we have not been able to find out this particular waterbody in our list of 26 bheris"". if local people are to be believed, some of them even received an ""incentive"" for not reporting the filling to police. nanda also accused the ""politician-promoter"" nexus for spoiling the waterbodies in and around the city. ""without having influence or money power, such illegal operation cannot be done,"" he said, adding, ""but the guilty will not be spared and we will give them exemplary punishment."" the minister wondered why the police did not know anything about the filling. ""payloaders were used and lots of people must have been engaged,"" he said. nanda ordered immediate arrest of all those associated with the crime. under the amended act, he hinted, the government would procure the filled up waterbodies but the cost of restoration would be realised from the guilty people. ""we are trying our best to preserve the waterbodies. in some areas of bhangar, we have given the waterbodies on a 25-year lease to unemployed youth. we will do that in other places now,"" he said, adding, ""there are 3,800 hectares of waterbodies in the state now and we will have to preserve that at any cost."" according to fisheries department deputy secretary madhumita mukherjee, before the formation of salt lake, the east calcutta wetlands comprised 20,000 hectares of waterbodies, which was reduced substantially afterwards. to add to the agony of the fisheries department, the bidhannagar municipality itself has filled up chinta singh bheri by dumping the garbage of salt lake into it. ""if a municipal body does such a thing, how can we fight the land sharks?"" a senior official asked. however, municipality chairman dilip gupta said, ""we are not sure whether we have filled up a water body but if a government department says so, we shall have to check the facts and take steps."" ---- bt road widening the much-awaited widening of the barrackpore trunk road will begin next month. the work will be done in two phases at a cost of rs 30 crore, said state pwd minister amar choudhury on friday. the first phase of the project, slated to begin in december, will concentrate on widening the 16-km stretch from dunlop to barrackpore. the work is to be completed within a year.
