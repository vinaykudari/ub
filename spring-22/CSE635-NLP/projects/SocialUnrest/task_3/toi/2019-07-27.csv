0,Gujarat polls will bring about social divide: Pawar,"MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Friday that the move to hold early elections in Gujarat was aimed at alienating the minorities and to create a clear divide in the society.

â€œThe situation in Gujarat is still not conducive for an early election. Many who have migrated to safe locations are still to return to their homes. An election at this juncture would only deny citizens their voting rights,â€™â€™ Mr Pawar said, adding that â€œcircumstances, however, would benefit certain forces who are eager to tear apart the social fabricâ€™â€™.

Mr Pawar was addressing an impressive gathering at Shanmukhananda Hall on the occasion of the centenary of the declaration of the job reservation policy of social reformer Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur.

The function was organised by the NCP and the Samata Parishad, an outfit floated by deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal. Social activists Baba Adhav and Arun Narke, minister of state for industries Jaydutt Kshirsagar and former minister Vasant Chavan were among those present at the function.

The NCP leader said the situation in Gujarat is a study in contrast. â€œPeople holding responsible positions are making disturbing statements. They have gone on publicly saying that the atmosphere is charged and it will best suit their purpose now to hold elections before people forget (the riots).

If they have their way in Gujarat, it will not be long before the situation spreads across to other states as well,â€™â€™ he warned.

Baba Adhav said the reservation policy might have benefited a select few, but it had not brought about the expected economic and social changes in those deprived communities.

â€œToday, there are 185 MPs in the Lok Sabha who belong to the deprived classes but none of them is taking an aggressive stand on the policy of reservations as it was done by Shahu Maharaj,â€™â€™ he said.

1,"Kargil amnesia hits state govt, citizens","LUCKNOW: In contrast to the euphoria generated in 1999, three years after ''Operation Vijay'', in 2002, both the common man as well as the state government appear to be suffering from Kargil amnesia. Let alone remember the martyrs on Kargil Day and fulfilling the promises made to their family members, neither the citizens, nor the government officials have the time for even the trademark lip-service rendered on such occasions.

So when the Army celebrated the third anniversary of the Kargil victory on Friday, no one from the civil administration neither from the state government turned up at ''Smritika'', the war memorial, to pay tribute to the fallen war heroes. This despite the fact that most officials, from chief minister Mayawati to the district magistrate, were invited for the occasion. The common man too was rather indifferent as only a poor strength of 50-odd citizens, arrived to pay their respects at Smritika.

3,Man with cartridges arrested at Amausi,"LUCKNOW: A prominent government contractor who hoodwinked the authorities at Palam airport was apprehended by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel at Amausi airport here on Friday. The Delhi-based businessman was nabbed while boarding a flight to the national capital. 33 rounds of 7.65 mm bore were recovered from his luggage.

The security officials at Amausi were stunned to learn that he had boarded a Lucknow-bound flight in Delhi on July 24 with the cartridges, which werenot be detected either by the Delhi Police or the airlines security.

According to reports, on Friday evening around 5 pm the CISF personnel were checking the luggage of passengers boarding Lucknow-Delhi flight number 726 of the Jet Airways at Amausi airport when the X-ray of the luggage of a passenger â€” Satyaveer Singh Tomar of Jankipuram in Delhi â€” emitted alarm signals. On checking the luggage, the security personnel recovered 33 cartridges from a jewellery pouch.

Initially, Singh introduced himself as a government contractor having multi-crore projects. He had come here on July 24 to attend a meeting with World Bank officials for road laying projects.

Singh told the CISF personnel that the cartridges were for his licensed firearm which, however, he was not carrying.

He claimed to have brought it ""by mistake"". Singh was booked under Section 10 (1) of the Aircraft Act and handed over to the Sarojini Nagar police.

4,Indians criticise the proposed deportation rule,"AHMEDABAD: The US Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS) is stepping up enforcement of a 50-year-old law requiring foreign residents to alert the government within 10 days of them changing addresses.Immigrant advocacy groups believe this policy is overreaching. Replying a query, Greg Siskind, immigration attorney practising in the US told TNN that with this rule, the INS has found a convenient way of holding immigrants, and that the INS has tremendous power to abuse its discretion with this regulation.Aside from keeping track of people entering the US, there is actually another reason that the Justice Department has to propose this rule, Siskind said. ""When the INS wants to put someone in deportation proceedings, it has to issue them a notice to appear. The INS typically sends the notice out to the latest address it has on file for the person. There has been at least one important court case that says that if someone does not receive the notice, then they have a defence later in fighting a deportation order issued in absentia. This is the case even if a person failed to notify the INS of an address change."" He added that, ""With this rule, INS then basically kills two birds with one stone. This rule will now require individuals to sign statements specifically acknowledging that they understand that they have to keep their address current. The government hopes that by making people specifically acknowledge their obligation to do this, courts will consider the individuals to have effectively waived any defence relating to not being properly notified because an old address was on file at the INS."" Anjan Contractor president of the Indian Association in Columbus said, ""how this rule will assist the government in combating against terrorists remains a question but it will certainly harass ordinary immigrants."" ""To make this effective, the INS has to have a supplementary program with a web-based and/or email-based system for notifying the agency of address changes,"" he added, "" without such mechanism it is difficult to get registered within 10 days of residence change.""Japan Doshi, who is on a work visa in the US said in fact, many of the immigrants on the work visa move around in different states in the US, while having a single place registered as a residence. He himself has registered Raleigh but since last two months he is at New Jersey for an internship.Chirag Parikh, a student from University of Texas, Arlington, said it is just one of the precautionary measures which does not do anything but provides the authorities with an excuse for violation of the law, if one fails to comply with it.Many Indian immigrants who are presently in the US are confused as they do not know what form of notification are they looking forward to from the INS, and how they are supposed to keep the INS informed. ""If it is just an e-mail or a phone call then it would be manageable,"" many wrote. Many immigrants said that it is shocking that drastic punishment like deportation can be given for violating what should really be seen as a minor provision in the law.Khagesh Pathak, student at Georgia College & State University said that reporting time of 10 days is less, as during the first week of change in residence one would be involved in settling many things like setting home, registering for utilities like gas, water and electricity etc. In such a short period, it would be really difficult to report the change in address to INS. ""Above all, this rule goes against basic ideology of the USA, as none of such rules are imposed on Americans. Then why discrimination towards immigrants?,"" he asked.

5,"Transit trucks will be banned, but how?","NEW DELHI: The ban on trucks not destined for Delhi will come into force from Saturday without any clear mechanism in place for identifying erring vehicles. The traffic police officials only have the consignment notes carried by truck drivers to go by. And these will be checked only at the 42 toll-tax counters along the city's borders.Also, there is no punishment for trucks caught trying to enter the city with fake consignment notes.''The only place where the trucks are stopped are at the toll-tax counters of the Delhi Municipal Corporation,'' said a transport department official. ''The documents will have to be checked at these counters to ascertain if the trucks are Delhi-bound or not,'' the official said.Now, toll tax is not dependent on the goods carried or the destination, but on the number of tyres the vehicle has. This means the traffic police are left with only the consignment notes, or bilti, as the transporters refer to it. These notes indicate the places where goods have to be delivered. ''If the note says the goods have to be delivered in Delhi, they will be allowed,'' a traffic police official said.This is where the catch is. If a truck is carrying even a small part of its entire consignment for Delhi, it will be allowed in. ''This means the consignment note will play a crucial role in gaining access to the city,'' said Deepak Sachdeva, president of Delhi Goods Transporters United Front.So what we may have now is a flow of fake consignment notes, say traders. ''Truckers are likely to carry some fake consignment notes. After all, they will be saving on time and fuel by transiting Delhi,'' a foodgrains trader at Azadpur Subzi Mandi said.And with traffic police presence thinning at night — when trucks ply the most — spotting erring vehicles may be tough.Traffic police officials, however, claim they will be able to book the truckers. ''We will stop the trucks found violating the laws and will drive them back,'' said Maxwell Pereira, joint commissioner of police (traffic).

6,PUTA protests decision on retirement age,"CHANDIGARH: More than 80 non-government colleges affiliated to Panjab University are likely to face a sudden academic vacuum in the wake of the recent rejection by the ministry of human resource development of the proposed amendment in PU regulations that would have enhanced the retirement age of teachers from 60 to 62 years.

On Friday a delegation of teachers from the Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) staged a rally to protest the decision.

Attendance at the rally was divided as a number of teachers had gone to the Punjab and Haryana High Court where affected teachers have filed a writ petition against the decision.

The writ is to come up for hearing on July 30.

As many as 65 PU faculty members of the rank of professor would retire within the next five days and 115 in the coming one year. This works out to three to five professors retiring from each of the major academic departments.

Panjab University had amended its regulations enhancing retirement age from 60 to 62 years following implementation of the University Grants Commission notification of a comprehensive pay package revision policy dated December 24, 1998. The amendments were a part of the conditions imposed by the UGC.

""If the government of India continues its refusal to accept the implementation of its own policies and recommendations as it has done through this communication, it will bring disastrous consequences for PU as a premier institution of higher education and research,"" said S P Gautam, general secretary of the All India Federation of University Teachers Associations (AIFUTA).

""Talented academics will prefer to join either the central universities or the universities in those states where the age of superannuation and subsequent extensions in service go up to 65 years,"" said P P Arya, president of AIFUTA.

University and college teachers are questioning the placing of higher education in the concurrent list if the Union government is to take decisions based on recommendations of the state government.

""The UGC is an organisation created by an Act of Parliament. It has clearly stated that retirement age has to be enhanced from 60 to 62, but the state government does not agree. How can this be possible? This raises doubts on the functioning of the system itself,"" said Charanjit Chawla, former general secretary of Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers Union.

President of PUTA P K Mittal said that the PU vice-chancellor was aware of the consequences of the sudden vacuum to be created due to 115 faculty members retiring in the coming one year.

""The V-C has assured us that he would not let the retiring faculty members have any difficulties and alternate arrangements would be made for them,"" said Mittal.

Time-tables already made in the university have suddenly lost their relevance as heads of departments are wondering for how long would they remain valid.

Many of the faculty members who would now retire on July 31 had been slotted for teaching classes for the entire academic session beginning July 2002.

7,Gay rights groups hail bid to amend law,"PUNE: City-based lesbian, gay, bisexual and transvestite support groups have welcomed Human Rights Watchâ€™s (HRW) decision asking the Centre to repeal section 377 of the IPC and to ensure protection of HIV/Aids workers in the country.

The New York-based HRW, in its 30-page report released at the XIV international Aids conference in Barcelona, Spain, on July 9, called upon the government of India to repeal the IPC section which declares homosexual acts illegal.

The report documents cases of harassment to and violence against HIV/Aids workers by the police in India and also includes excerpts from â€˜Police, ruffians hound CSWs engaged in Aids prevention driveâ€™, a report published by The Times of India, Pune, on February 20, 2002.

Poet-novelist R. Raj Rao, founder of Queer Study Circle, Pune, said it was ridiculous for India to continue with the law (section 377) when all leading nations had repealed it. â€œItâ€™s time the government takes note of this and annuls the law,â€� Rao said.

Joanne Csete, director, HIV/Aids and human rights programme at HRW, said the Indian government was shooting its own Aids programme in the foot. â€œThe government provides condoms and funds to groups doing Aids outreach work with high-risk people and says this is a priority for Aids prevention.

However, official statements ring hollow in the face of police violence,â€� he said, adding, â€œThe big winner here is the Aids epidemic, which will continue to kill millions unless this abuse is stopped.â€�

Amruta of city-based sexual minorities group, â€œOlavaâ€�, said it was undemocratic and discriminatory to have section 377.

Mumbai Humsafar Trust founder Ashok Row Kavi said not only HIV/Aids workers but all who are â€œperceivedâ€� as a threat to the social order are also threatened with incarceration.

â€œMany of these laws are totally against article 21 of the Constitution which assures freedom of assembly and the right to life and liberty. It is important that these laws are challenged by NGOs facing harassment at the grass-root level,â€� he said.

10,Cinchona workers oppose downsizing advice,"DARJEELING: Members of the Hill Employees Association (Cinchona Zonal plantation Committee) and the Sanjukta Morcha (comprising five unions) on Friday opposed the Mckinsey report on cinchona plantation.

During the day, the unions met district magistrate Hritesh Mohan and conveyed their feelings.

At present, the cinchona plantations are facing a loss of Rs 24 crore annually. Sanjukta Morcha president L M Sharma said, â€œThe project report prepared by Mckinsey has not been done properly as the officials of the company never visited Mungpoo. Before preparing such a report the company should have consulted the cinchona research department and the local people.â€�

The cultivation on an extensive scale of those species of cinchona which contain quinine and the allied alkaloids in their bark, began in 1864.

At present there are 1,050 staff, 52 officers and 5,350 labourers working in the cinchona plantations.

16,‘Powerless' Gurdaspur farmers fear drought,"PATHANKOT: With the monsoon remaining elusive and the notoriously erratic PSEB inflicting more power cuts than before, a feeling of powerlessness has gripped both the farmers and residents of the Gurdaspur district.

While the people have been performing â€˜â€˜havansâ€™â€™ to please the â€˜rain godâ€™, they are cursing the PSEB for resorting to unscheduled cuts for hours. The worst sufferers of the power cuts are the old, the infirm and the children who are finding it extremely difficult to breathe in the sweltering hot season.

According to reports reaching here, some of the Shahpur Kandi areas did not have power for the five days due to faulty transformers which needed immediate replacement.

With no power to run their tubewells, and no sign of rain yet, the paddy has wilted up to 50 per cent in some of the villages and if this situation continued for some more days, it could be a drought-like situation, according to villagers.

Former education minister Master Mohan Lal, who toured the Kandi area to take a first-hand account of the dry spell in the rain-fed villages, said more than 25 villages were facing a droughtlike situation. The government should order the revenue officials to reach the spot for making an assessment of the loss to farmers due to dry weather, said Mohan Lal.

Holding the Amarinder Singh government responsible for not making uninterrupted eight hoursâ€™ power supply to the Kandi villages, the former minister said the farmers of the area have yet to receive the compensation announced by the government for the last paddy crop.

Making a gloomy forecast for the paddy crop, Hardyal Singh, a BKU leader, told TNN on Saturday: â€˜â€˜While saline soil conditions had been a perennial source of worry to the farmers, paddy crops in Ram Diwali, Khode Bet, Singhpur, Dharamkot Randhawa, Thetherke, Ratta, Shahpur Jajan, Abdal, Khushalpur, Mulowali, MannJourian, Kalanwali, Pakhoke, Shahpur Gurayan, Chakanwali, Badlolpur, Haveialn and Ghuman villages were severely hit by drought-like conditions.â€™â€™

â€˜Power-lessâ€™ Gurdaspur farmers fear drought day remand Tangri Khanna to help Union minister of state for tourism and culture Vinod Khanna on Saturday assured central financial aid to the Pathankot Municipal Council president Satish Mahajan to augment drinking power supply in Pathankot.

An MP from Gurdaspur, Khanna had arrived here on Saturday morning to attend a party function in Sujanpur but had to shelve his plans following the death of vice-president.

17,Kandi farmers urge for lesser power tariff,"HOSHIARPUR: Farmers of the Kandi area urged state health minister Ramesh Dogra, MLA from Dasuya, to address their demand of one-third tariff in case the Punjab government decided to levy electricity bills on agriculture.

Bhagwant Singh Ahluwalia, president, New Age Fruit Growers Association (NAFGA), while speaking at a dinner meeting at local Services Club, requested the minister to become a representative of the Kandi farmers and lead their delegation to meet the chief minister to apprise him of their problems.

According to Ahluwalia though NAFGA had represented its case of one-third tariff for Kandi area to Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission , yet the decision of charging bills to agriculture sector was going to be a political one.

Ahluwalia informed the minister that in Kandi the water-table was very low as compared to other areas in Punjab, due to which to draw one cusec of water three times more power was needed.

So, while deciding the electricity tariff, the government should keep this rationale in mind, he said. The farmers also demanded 24-hour electricity supply for the Kandi area as they claimed they had become virtually bankrupt coping with diesel bills for irrigation purposes.

Kamaljit Chopra, superintending engineer (SE), PSEB, informed the farmersâ€™ group that PSEB had in May taken a policy decision to provide 24-hour three-phase electricity to Kandi but due to the delayed monsoon the same could not be implemented.

18,Punjab govt-staff meet called off,"CHANDIGARH: The crucial meeting between the Punjab government and representatives of 21 employee outfits was called off after paying tributes to Vice President Krishan Kant who died on Saturday morning.

Talking to Times News Network, Punjab agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal said that she along with finance minister Lal Singh and local government minister Jagjit Singh met the employees and decided to take up their issues at a later date.

On the other hand, the Punjab government has also set up two separate sub-committees to probe into genuine grievances of the employees of the Punjab State Undertakings (PSUs) and the state government.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had assured on Friday that the government would redress the employeesâ€™ problems at the earliest after giving them ample opportunity to plead their case.

He had told the Maha Sangh of Punjab state co-operative, boards and corporation workers and Joint Action Committee of Punjab and UT employees that the government was committed to safeguard the interests of the state employees.

To dispel apprehensions about the state governmentâ€™s move on disinvestment of PSUs, the CM has assured that the government was not bound to implement the Vaishnav Committee Report on disinvestment. Besides, the disinvestment process was a long drawn out and the government was aware of its pros and cons.

He has also assured that the suggestions put forth by the various associations with regard to disinvestment, pay parity among the state government and PSUsâ€™ employees, restoration of DA and other related demands would be discussed by the sub-committee.

He clarified that the government was considering the disinvestment option only in five PSUs - Punjab Tourism Development Corporation, Punjab Tractors Ltd, Punjab Communication Ltd, Punjab Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd, as well as Conware. There was no proposal to initiate disinvestment in all the 29 PSUs.

19,‘PSERC should allow increase in tariff’,"PATIALA: The Punjab State Electricity Board is suffering loss of Rs 8 crore each day and any further delay in revision of tariff could lead to its collapse, adversely affecting the availability of power in the state and also its economy.

This was stated at a seminar organised here on Saturday by the management of the Board to apprise leaders of different unions about the Boardâ€™s latest financial position.

A PSEB spokesman said that at the seminar there was a consensus that the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) should allow the Board to increase tariff in such a way that it was able to function as an autonomous body.

Besides, he said, it was also concluded that the government should suitably compensate the Board for providing power at subsidised rates. The Board is no longer in a position to raise loans to cover deficits since its credibility had fallen in the eyes of lending institutions, he said.

As per statutory requirement of the Indian Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, the Board has to generate at least three per cent surplus on its net fixed assets whereas the present rate of returns of the Board is minus 44 per cent.

The Board is in this situation inspite of best operating parameters in comparison to neighbouring state electricity boards.

The highlight of the seminar was an elaborate presentation by ICRA, a leading consultation company of Delhi, covering various aspects of the overall functioning of the Board.

The firm has been engaged by the PSEB to represent its point of view before the PSERC regarding the revision in tariff.
