1,'Punjab ministers don't pay income tax',"chandigarh: who pays the income tax of punjab ministers? the ministers themselves, one would expect. but it is not so. the income tax of the ministers is paid by the punjab government. though it sounds strange, it is not illegal. usually, income tax is paid by individuals and not by the employer. however, some business houses do pay the income tax for their top executives as the contractual obligation, as part of the salary package. but then the income tax itself is considered as perquisite and added to the income of the employee for purpose of commuting his tax liability. similarly, the punjab government pays the income tax of its ministers. an amendment to ``the east punjab ministers' salaries act, 1947'' was effected through punjab act 14 of 1976, which provides that the salaries and allowances paid to a minister, and free furnished house and other perquisites admissible to him, under the act, shall be exclusive of income tax which shall be payable by the state government. initially, the salaries and other perquisites were not very high but now the income tax paid by the punjab government runs into lakhs of rupees. the punjab government had paid rs 11.99 lakh in 1998-99 and rs 15.87 lakh in 1999-2000 as income tax for its ministers. the details of last year's tax liabilities are yet to be finalised. the income tax liability of the government for the present akali-bjp ministry seems to be very high in view of the fact that all the ministers at their first meeting had announced that they would draw only a token salary of re 1. interestingly, all but two ministers (chief minister and finance minister) later started drawing the entire salary and permissible allowances. each minister is entitled to a pay packet of rs 9,250 which includes salary, sumptuary and constituency allowance and a fixed medical allowance. while the cm's packet is heavier by rs 1,000, deputy ministers and parliamentary secretaries get rs 8,500 only. besides, the ministers are provided furnished houses and even the maintenance charges are borne by the government. also, they are provided with services of cooks, gardener and domestic help, free lpg and electricity - most of which are considered as perquisites and attract income tax. the ministers opting to stay in private/personal accommodation earlier received rs 15,000 as house rent allowance, which was enhanced to rs 30,000 a couple of years ago and such a massive house rent allowance itself attracts substantial income tax. but if a minister has income from other sources, he would have to pay tax to that extent from his own pocket.

2,'Enron's allegations will hurt foreign investment',"pune: unhappy with enron for its ""extreme"" step of serving a pre-termination notice (ptn) to the maharashtra government over the issue of continuance in dabhol power project (dpp), former chief minister of maharashtra sharad pawar said the us power company's charges of political interference would create a negative impression about india in the minds of foreign investors. although the resignations of three members from the madhav godbole committee was unfortunate and led to some confusion, it did not warrant such a drastic step by enron, mr pawar said. the us power major should not discard the option of negotiations, he added. advising an amicable solution to the present deadlock between enron and the maharashtra government, he said, the state is no position to buy the costly power to be supplied by dabhol power company (dpc) from its second phase in near future. ""moreover, the state does not have a demand good enough to consume all the electricity offered by phase ii of enron,"" he added. mr pawar said, the surplus power generated by phase ii of enron could be utilised by the centre to bail out other states facing inadequate power supply. ""there are many states in the country, which have an acute power shortage. instead of going for new capital intensive power projects in these states, the centre should purchase the surplus electricity to be made available by phase ii of enron,"" he clarified. mr pawar said, while the centre's change of mind on the issue of taking over dpc phase ii was crucial, it is imperative for the us power major to reduce its steep power price. asked about the financial implications arising out of enron's likely exit from the dpc, mr pawar said, such an eventuality should be avoided at all costs. ""the centre and the state will have to pay astronomical costs if the talks fail. the heavy penalty would be simply unbearable,"" he added.

3,Vajpayee government directionless: Pawar,"pune: dubbing the atal bihari vajpayee government as the most non-performing regime, nationalist congress party (ncp) president sharad pawar has said that the bjp-led coalition government at the centre had no control over the administration and was totally directionless. delivering the concluding address of the vasant vyakhyanmala here on sunday, pawar said the vajpayee government had failed to take bold steps on crucial issues like economy and second generation reforms. ""the traditional middle-class voters of the bjp are disillusioned with the party for its inherent failure to make strong decisions on various sensitive issues,"" he added. analysing the results of the recently-concluded assembly elections in five states, pawar said the electorate of kerala and tamil nadu had continued with their tradition of throwing the incumbent government out of power. ""the voters in both the states have a history of swinging between two extremes,"" he added. pawar said the landslide victory of ms jayalalitha had proved that the indian voters, especially women, cannot tolerate vindictive behaviour and victimisation of a woman leader. pawar said although the congress had put up a good show in kerala and assam, the overall strength of the party in parliament would not show any significant increase in the lok sabha polls. ""the victory of samajwadi party (sp) candidate in the bypolls from the shahjehanpur lok sabha seat again proves the growing clout of the regional parties in indian politics,"" pointed pawar. making a holistic review of india's relations with its neighbours, mr pawar said the centre should avoid a confrontation with bangladesh as it would gladden the hawks in pakistan wanting to destabilise the indo-bangla border. ""the recent strikes by the bangladesh rifles (bdr) was triggered by pakistan's isi with the help of some middle-rung officers inclined towards an islamic state. any aggressive stance would alienate bangladesh's friendly political leadership from india,"" he added. pawar supported the vajpayee government's initiative to have a ceasefire in the strife-torn kashmir valley.
