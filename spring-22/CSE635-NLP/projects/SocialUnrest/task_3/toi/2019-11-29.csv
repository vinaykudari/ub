0,BJP draws flak for seeking Krishna govt’s dismissal,"BANGALORE: The KPCC on Thursday criticised the state BJP for seeking the dismissal of the Krishna government.

KPCC President Allum Veerabhadrappa told reporters the party was giving prominence to a book written by somebody who has failed to produce evidence for the allegations he made.

On Wednesday, the state BJP met Governor T.N. Chaturvedi and sought the dismissal of the Krishna government based on allegations made by former DGP C. Dinakar in his book â€” â€œThe Prize Catch of Veerappan: Rajkumarâ€™â€™.

Lambasting the BJP, he said: â€œIt should set its house in order before criticising others. Eight BJP legislators switched over to our party because they were disgusted with BJP. More want to join, but we have put it on hold for the moment.â€™â€™ He also said the BJP had lost its moral right to ask for the Congress governmentâ€™s ouster since the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre was enmeshed in more scandals and corruption cases than any other.

On efforts to get kidnapped former minister H. Nagappa released from the clutches of Veerappan, Veerabhadrappa said: â€œAll efforts are on, but it is a slow process. With the High Court approving Kolathur Maniâ€™s bail, he will shortly be sent as emissary.â€™â€™

Asked what guarantee the government had that Mani would return from the forest, he remarked: â€œHope!â€™â€™

1,Domestic violence bill dubbed most regressive,"LUCKNOW: The debate continues for capital punishment for rapists. Another link was added to this chain of argument by womenâ€™s organisations in a press conference held in the AIDWA office on Thursday.

They emphasised that the most regressive and derogatory bill in the history of bills passed for women empowerment is the proposed Protection From Domestic Violence (PFDV) bill. Dubbed as the domestic violence perpetrators protection bill, here is a valiant attempt by them at interpreting this bill.

Section 4 (a): If a husband beats his wife black and blue on every Wednesday of every month, perhaps that would be considered domestic violence. However, if a woman is physically assaulted once, donâ€™t bother seeking help, as this cannot be construed as â€˜habitual or repeated assaultâ€™.

Section 4 (2): On the pretext of a broken cup, as that is the husbandâ€™s property, he is entitled to beat his wife. The aforementioned clause provides that no man shall be held accountable for domestic violence if he is protecting his property, read movable and immovable. Additionally, if all else fails, the man can always plead innocence on the ground that he beat his wife in â€˜self-defenceâ€™.

Section 2 (k): If a neighbour or friend is screaming for help or requesting support, the bill recommends - donâ€™t interfere. Negating the help of the community, friends and NGOs for a domestic violence victim, the bill legitimises support from only a registered voluntary association.

Section 14 of the bill lists the remedies that the victim is entitled to. The court can â€˜orderâ€™, read, reprimand the perpetrator to stop committing domestic violence and payment of monetary relief over a limited period. That the wife is often abandoned or the wife denied the custody of her children has been ignored. The need for pre-emptive measures for protection, then rehabilitation and adequate monetary compensation have been omitted.

In all the acts relating to the rights of women, be it the Immoral Trafficking Act or the Dowry Act, provision has been made for a Protection Officer. Sections 5,6,7 and 8 of PFDV bill does the same. However, experience in UP shows that either no such officer is ever appointed or otherwise the person appointed has no understanding of gender issues and often acts as an impediment to the process of rehabilitation.

The numerous discrepancies and the regressive nature of the proposed bill has given rise to vehement opposition by womenâ€™s organisations.

2,AU students step up protest against V-C,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Students belonging to several government and private colleges in this port city on Thursday abstained from classes in response to the token bandh call given by the all-party solidarity committee, demanding the recall of ''disciplinarian'' Andhra University vice-chancellor Prof Y C Simhadri.

While no untoward incident was reported, the vice-chancellor ordered opening of all affiliated colleges from Friday. However, no decision had been taken regarding the opening of campus colleges of the varsity, closed since November 23.

The vice-chancellor had returned to the city after apprising Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and higher education department officials, besides the chancellor-cum-governor, of the situation.

The unrest was triggered by the finding of some worms in the food served in a particular hostel a fortnight ago.

A report from Guntur adds, educational institutions in this district were closed on Thursday. Students took out a rally in Guntur raising slogans against his ""dictatorial policies''''.

They said the VC was harming the future of thousands of students. Most private colleges closed voluntarily and students forced the remaining to down shutters. Police arrested agitating student leaders when they gathered at Hindu College. Mild tension prevailed at the college as police warned the students repeatedly to disperse while the latter insisted that the principal support them. The student leaders assured police they were not going to block roads.

Despite their request, police denied them the permission to stay on. Students entered into an argument with the police, following which the police took some of them into custody.

SFI leaders Nalinikanth, Lakshminarayana, Mutyala Rao, Lenin, NSUI leader Satyam Singh, Ch Venu, P Nageswara Rao, PDSU leader Deva, DYFI secretary Chaitanya were detained.

Meanwhile, students of several colleges in Vijayawada boycotted their classes on Thursday to express solidarity with agitating Andhra University (AU) students.

Students of KBN, Sathavahana, SRR, Sardha, Appalaswamy colleges boycotted classes protesting against the closure of Andhra University hostels and demanding recall of the AU vice-chancellor.

Criticising the ""autocratic"" style of functioning of the vice-chancellor, SFI city unit secretary P Shankar said the university official was curbing the democratic rights of students and initiating drastic action in the name of discipline and improving educational standards.

3,MIM boycotts CM’s iftar party,"HYDERABAD: The MIM boycotted the iftar hosted by the chief minister on Thursday protesting the recent â€œfake encountersâ€™â€™ in which two men were killed.

The police allege the two men were Lashkar-e-Tayyeba militants responsible for the bomb blast at a temple in Dilsukhnagar.

MIM MLA Asaduddin Owaisi said after an all-party meet the participants resolved to give Chandrababu Naidu seven days time to take action in this regard. â€œIf no action is taken, we will organise massive protests,â€� Owaisi said.

Congress leaders Mohammed Ali Shabbir, Sudhakar Reddy and Peopleâ€™s Union for Civil Liberties president K G Kannabiran attended the meet. Congress leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy and TRS chief K Chandrashekhar Rao, who were invited for the meeting, did not turn up.

Owaisi said the participants decided to raise four demands. Firstly, the government should bring to book the real culprits behind the Dilsukhnagar bomb blast at the earliest. Second, the Rangareddy district superintendent of police and other police officials involved in the â€œencounterâ€™â€™ should be dismissed.

Another resolution was that the government should set up an inquiry commission headed by a sitting judge of the High Court to probe the encounters.

Owaisi said police had arrested four more boys in connection with the bomb blast. He demanded that the boys be presented before the press. Letters would also be sent to the National Human Rights Commission to investigate the two killings, he said.

4,Every fifth Telugu to have a party,"HYDERABAD: If the ambitious goals set by three major political parties of the state â€” the BJP, TDP and the Congress â€” materialise, every fifth citizen of Andhra Pradesh would be a member of any of these by early next year.

The ruling party has taken the lead by setting itself a target of enrolling 70 lakh people as members.

The TDP claims that it has 52 lakh primary members and 12 lakh active members and intends to achieve a 10 per cent growth in the ongoing membership drive. A TDP leader said the party has already achieved 40 per cent of the target. He exuded confidence that rest of the target will be reached before schedule.

Not to lag behind, the Pradesh Congress Committee has also chalked out plans to undertake a massive enrolment drive, beginning December 28. Though PCC general secretary K R Amos admitted that at present only 28 lakh people were registered as members of the Congress, he is hopeful of admitting as many as 60 lakh members into the party in the run up to the 2004 Assembly elections.

Amos asserted that membership drive is a continuous process, and said the Congress intended to create a strong base in the state, right from the polling booth-level.

The BJP, TDPâ€™s ally in AP, has also embarked on a major drive to attract people, especially minorities, Dalits, tribals and women, to join its fold. According to BJP general secretary K Lakshman, the party has set itself a target of enrolling 25 lakh members. The BJP claims that it has a base of 16 lakh members.

If the ongoing enrolment goes according to the expectations of these parties, the cumulative party membership would touch about 1.55 crore, which is roughly one fifth of the 7.5-crore population of AP. This shows that every fifth person in the state would be a member of a political party.

Though the three parties publicly maintain that all their members are genuine, insiders confess that the membership drives remain a farce. â€œInstances of local leaders entering the names of people from votersâ€™ list as party members are so common and the top leadership is aware of it,â€� a BJP leader said.

5,20 Warangal farmers die of pesticide poisoning,"HYDERABAD: Manda Rami Reddy never had any health problems. On November 13 this year, the 47-year-old farmer was spraying pesticide on the chilli crop in his field in Cherial of Warangal district, when he suddenly fell unconscious.

Doctors at the Area Hospital in Janagam declared him dead, and cited poisoning due to pesticide as the possible reason for his death.

Reddy was not wearing gloves nor had he covered his face while spraying, family members said.

On that day, he had sprayed the drug for about 90 minutes and then rested and resumed spraying for another half-an-hour before he fell unconscious.

Doctors at the Janagam hospital said so far more than 164 cases of pesticide poisoning were reported from the region this year, out of which 20 persons died. All the patients showed symptoms like vomiting, giddiness and nausea. Villagers in the area also confirmed this.

Though, according to doctors, the number of deaths due to pesticide poisoning this year is less compared to last year, evidence suggests that the problem continues to haunt farmers in the region.

Centre for Resource Educationâ€™s (CRE) D Narasimha Reddy, who has been tracking these deaths over the past couple of years, said there is an urgent need to educate farmers on proper spraying methods.

Pesticides in this region have gained popularity among farmers based on word of mouth. Companies also increase potency of pesticides to make them more effective, he explained.

Officials of the directorate of agriculture admitted the occurrence of deaths due to pesticide poisoning, and said the number has fallen thanks to lack of rains and resultant reduction in pesticide consumption this year.

They also added that farmers in the region are now more aware of the ill-effects of exposure to pesticides.

Officials of the department said that though they are trying to promote organic farming, pesticide companies and their dealers, who have established a strong marketing network in rural areas, are nudging farmers to use pesticides.

6,V-C orders probe into Bihar varsity incident,"MUZAFFARPUR: The vice-chancellor (V-C) of BRA Bihar University Nihar Nandan Prasad Singh announced the formation of a three-member probe committee here on Thursday to inquire into the recent mischievous activities of a few anti-social elements who tried to intimidate university officials and teachers engaged in examination work.

Talking to newspersons here, the V-C asserted that the university would prevent outsiders'' interference in the examination work at all costs so as it preserve the sanctity of examinations. He has asked the police and administration also to restore normalcy on the campus but and arrest any staff of the university in this connection only if there is a sufficient evidence to prove his involvement in the crime.

The university employees went on a lightning strike on Thursday in protest against making one of the employees Ramanek Thakur accused in a case regarding planting of bomb-like objects in the residential premises of director of evaluation and pro V-C. The employees returned to their duty in the second half on assurance from the V-C that Thakur would not be arrested without proof of crime.

The V-C said that the mischief mongers'' main objective was more to intimidate examination duty officers than to damage life or property. There has not been any shortcoming or loopholes in the examination system of the university which could have left chance for outsiders'' interference, he claimed.

The V-C said the university cannot afford to divert its attention on such trivial matters at a time when it is facing the challenge of do or die because of the increasing competitions on launching job-linked courses all over the country.

The V-C who returned here on Thursday from Mumbai after taking part in an all-India V-C meet on November 25 said that the UGC chairman Arun Nigwekar clearly told the V-Cs that the universities would have to improve their quality in teaching and link education with employment. Therefore, the university has no time to grapple with such issues.

Meanwhile, the leaders of BRA Bihar University Service Teachers Association (BRABUSTA) appealed to district administration on Wednesday to immediately arrest the mischievous elements who are trying to terrorise the teachers and university officers for fulfiling their selfish interests and disrupt the ongoing centralised evaluation of answerbooks.

The president and general secretary of BRABUSTA, Sachindra Kumar Singh and Kaushal Kishore Sharma respectively said that in case the police fail to nab the culprits who planted bomb- like objects.

7,Laloo ridicules DGP at iftar party,"PATNA: For Bihar DGP R R Prasad, attending the iftar hosted by state governor V C Pande in the Raj Bhavan on Thursday, was certainly not a pleasant experience as ruling RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav utilised the occasion to publicly take potshots at the DGP for describing himself as ""Dhritrashtra"" who cannot stop Draupadi's ""chirharan (disrobing)"", while speaking on the helplessness of the police in improving law and order in the state at a public function. The Patna High Court had subsequently quoted the DGP's statement while hearing the case pertaining to encroachments in Digha. After the departure of Pande, DGP Prasad got an ""opportunity"" to offer his ""pranam"" to Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Laloo Prasad, who was moving outside the hall in the company of chief minister Rabri Devi, chairman of the state legislative council Jabir Hussain, speaker of the assembly Sadanand Singh besides a number of ministers. Seeing the DGP, Laloo spontaneously remarked: ""Ab inko dekhiye kya kya bol rahe hain. TV wallah pucha to ham bole ki kisi dusare context mein bole honge (See, what is he speaking. When TV journalists asked me, I told them that he must have said it in some other context)."" He, however, failed to conceal his feelings and turning towards Jabir Hussain said: ""Jante hain, ab retire karne wale officers ko neta sab chadha deta hai ki mantri, vidhayak aur rajdoot ban jaoge (Now officers, who are on the verge of retirement, are easily entrapped by politicians by promising to make them minister, MLA or ambassador)."" In his typical style, Laloo further remarked: ""The time has come to pass a resolution for not appointing such officers to the key posts in the state."" Hearing Laloo's comment, chief minister Rabri Devi did not miss an opportunity to give a smile. Many ministers, state chief secretary S N Biswas, top police officers and city-based prominent doctors were present at the iftar party. The DGP, however, found atleast one prominent politician who supported him for making such a ""bold"" statement. But the politician came to the DGP's rescue only after Laloo had left the scene. The politician lauded the DGP saying that he had sketched the true picture of the present scenario. Recalling his personal experience at a recent function he said: ""I was left speechless when a group of children asked me why there is such a sharp growth in kidnapping cases in Bihar"". He said situation in Bihar was really bad and people who hold important posts should own up responsibility.

8,Bardhan lambasts govt’s anti-people policies,"HYDERABAD: The Communist Party of India (CPI) has given a call to all leftist and secular forces to come together and capture power as they were the only organisations having pro-poor leanings.

CPI national general secretary A B Bardhan appealed to the people to recognise the leftist forces as the true representatives of the poor, farmers, workers, tribals and other oppressed sections of the society and support them.

Addressing a massive public meeting on Thursday, organised by the CPI to oppose â€œthe anti-people policies of the state and central governmentsâ€�, Bardhan gave a call for â€œjail bharoâ€� programme on January 8, throughout the country. He said all the major trade unions, including those affiliated to the Sangh Parivar would extend support to the programme.

He said in continuation of the agitations against the policies of the government five lakh people would stage protests on February 25, near Parliament. He said the left parties would also launch a agitation to oppose the eviction of tribals from forests. He called upon people to oppose the communal forces and termed the forthcoming Gujarat election a battle to protect the secular fabric of the country.

Taking potshots at chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu for harping on the development of Hyderabad under his hi-tech rule, Bardhan pointed out that the number of suicides had consistently increased in the state. He criticised Naidu for functioning as a â€˜peonâ€™ of the World Bank and IMF and following their diktats pushing the state into a debt trap.

Earlier, CPI state secretary S Sudhakar Reddy accused Naidu of supporting a corrupt NDA government that was involved in coffins, petrol bunks, and submarine scams. He termed the slogan of â€œSwarnandhrapradeshâ€� by Naidu as a farce to gain publicity. He blamsed Naidu for missing an opportunity to solve the naxalite problem.

CPI central committee member Dasari Nagabushan Rao, central committee member P Nageswara Rao, World Trade Union president K L Mahendra and others participated.

10,"For this band of brothers, it's partytime again","VADODARA: The riots destroyed their homes, killed their loved ones, but not their spirits. So seven months on, the elections are music to their ears.

For the dholwalas of Raja Rani Talav Basti, days would be hectic now and nights partytime. The countdown for the next week, when campaigning starts, has already begun in the upbeat hearts here.

For the residents of this basti of traditional dholis, elections are good news â€” for none other reason but the fact that it''s prime business time. After loss of livelihood in the aftermath of the riots, all that the dholwalas here are concerned about is work.

Interestingly, the riots failed to affect the camaraderie between Hindus and Muslims here. Several Muslims and Hindus here are engaged in the business of dhol and tasa playing. And with elections round the corner, they know they are in demand.

Almost every political party hires dholis to accompany them during campaigning to attract voters.

Politics is an alien word for them as elections mean work and money for them. They can play with equal fervour for any party. Afterall, they may not get this opportunity for five years.

The Muslims do not mind wearing saffron bands.

Arif Diwan of the Dhamali Dhol Tasa Party, who has got a contract to play for the BJP, started his work on Saturday when Lakhawala went to file his nomination papers.

""I have no problems playing for any party. I am a Muslim, but I do not mind wearing the saffron head band when I go to work. Similarly, I do not mind when the pujari applies a tilak on my forehead when I play the dhol for a marriage procession or a religious function,"" he says.

""We are traditionally known as dholwalas who play Ram Dhols or Nasik Dhols and the Tasa,"" says Jayesh Pardesi.

11,Panel soon to oversee functioning of J&K govt,"NEW DELHI: Almost a month after formation of a government in Jammu and Kashmir, the PDP-led coalition constituents are close to setting up a coordination committee to oversee the functioning of the government.

The committee, to be headed by a Congress representative, would provide a forum for discussions on important matters to help the government take collective decisions.

""Groundwork has already been done and I have informally discussed the matter"" with Chief Minister and PDP president Mufti Sayeed and Congress President Sonia Gandhi, state Congress chief Ghulam Nabi Azad said here.

Formal discussions will take place soon as ""we were waiting for the Assembly session in the state to get over"", he said.

Stating that the committee would be headed by a Congress leader as per an understanding between the coalition partners, Azad said the membership will not be more than 10.

""All the coalition partners -- PDP, Congress, CPM, People''s Democratic Forum (PDF), Panthers Party and one independent each from Ladakh and Kargil -- would get representation in the Committee according to the number of legislators,"" he said.

The formation of the committee, likely to be headed by Azad, assumes significance as it would provide a forum for the coalition partners to deliberate on crucial issues, particularly after a controversy has arisen over release of some separatists by the government recently.

12,Stockbroker Ashok Poddar arrested,"KOLKATA: Absconding stockbroker Ashok Kumar Poddar, wanted in connection with the Rs 120 crore scam at Calcutta Stock Exchange, was arrested at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on Thursday night, the police said.

Poddar was taken into custody as he flew into the city from Guwahati travelling on a false indentity, police said.

Poddar was last of the three prime accused to have been arrested in the scam. Investigations were initiated following an FIR by the CSE in September.

The other two prime accused Harish Chander Biyani and Dinesh Kumar Singhania, former president of CSE, were arrested on September 23 and November 20 respectively.

The total number of arrests in the case has gone up to 17 and include former CEO and MD of Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited B V Gaud, a senior vice-president of IndusInd Bank S N Paul and former MD of SREI Securities Dinesh Jain.

Former vice-president of CSE K K Daga was arrested on charges of not acting promptly despite being informed by IndusInd Bank about return of margin cheques issued by the three prime accused and their firms in March 2001.

Paul was charged with delaying by two days passing of information to CSE after cheques issued by the three were dishonoured. He was also charged for conspiring with Gaud and Biyani with the motive to dupe the exchange.

13,Fear grips Mehsana ahead of polls,"MEHSANA, Gujarat: Fear grips Dasaj village of Unjha constituency in this north Gujarat district as countdown to the crucial Assembly polls begins.

The communal divide cannot be more apparent than in this remote riot-hit hamlet, where a fifth of the population is Muslim. They do not dare to step into Hindu dominated areas despite round-the-clock police patrolling every 50 feet.

Worse, the Muslims say they will not vote if their polling booth falls in the Hindu area and have demanded a separate booth for the minorities.

Things are not as bad in other areas of Mehsana district, comprising seven assembly constituencies, but the BJP cannot bank on the votes of the minorities, several of whom did vote for the party in the last two elections.

What it can take solace from in a clear Congress-BJP fight, throwing over 20 other candidates out of the race, is the fact that the Muslims constitute only seven per cent of the votebank.

As many as 386 of the 1,358 polling booths have been identified as sensitive and hyper-sensitive in Mehsana, where 72 people were killed during the recent riots.

""We have asked for 20 companies of paramilitary forces. Some are already patrolling sensitive areas including Kadi and Unjha,"" says Mehsana Superintendent of Police A K Sharma.

However, Jayanti Barot, Rajya Sabha MP hailing from Mehsana contends there is no polarisation saying such pictures are created by the media and outsiders.

Barot claims the violence will not have an impact on the votes during the elections in which security and development issues will dominate. ""The Muslims of Gujarat live peacefully. Only some of them are fundamentalist and cause problems.""

Sharma says there is no law and order problem and all those displaced during the violence have their names on voting lists in the district with a population of around 12 lakh, dominated by Patels and Thakores.

In Dasaj village of Unjha with 1,72,855 voters, ex-sarpanch Hayat Khan says there is panic in the air with the polls nearing while Purshottam Patel, husband of the present Sarpanch Shivi Patel says peace is still elusive. Both have their own stories to tell about a dargah and temple.

Two persons, one of each community, had been killed in the violence in this village.

In Kadi, where Gujarat Finance Minister Nitin Patel has been sitting MLA for ten years, Congress is upbeat about the chances of its candidate Baldeb Thakore, claiming that the absence of Janata Dal in the fray this time will ensure the BJP''s defeat in the contest between a Patel and a Thakore.

Suresh Kadam, who runs a silver shop in this small town, does not feel the minister had anything to do with the riots and will be returned ""because he has given roads, water and electricity.""

Right across, Hanif, also a shop owner, says he has been voting for Nitin ""but this time the riots are on our minds.... When in Delhi the BJP says Godhra will be an issue, how can we forget it.""

14,SC reserves verdict on plea challenging Kalam's election,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday reserved its verdict on a petition challenging A P J Abdul Kalam''s election as the President on the ground that the rule framed by Parliament making it mandatory for candidates to have 50 proposers and 50 seconders violated fundamental rights of people who want to contest for the highest post.

Rejecting the plea of the petitioner Charan Lal Sahu for issuance of notice, a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice G B Pattanaik said, ""We will answer the questions raised by you in the petition. Whether notices should be issued or not would depend on our order.""

The bench, also comprising Justice V N Khare, Justice K G Balakrishnan, Justice Ashok Bhan and Justice Arun Kumar, made it clear that they were hearing arguments on the admissibility of the petition.

Contending that the whole election process for the Presidential post was vitiated by the ""illegal"" provisions made by Parliament on proposers and seconders, the petitioner, whose nomination papers for the Presidential election were rejected at the threshold, said that the returning officer ""wrongly accepted the nomination papers of Kalam and Capt Laxmi Sehgal"".

He said that Kalam has not provided several vital information in his nomination papers including the acutal age.

When he tried to compare the status of the post of the President with that of a Member of Parliament, the court reprimanded him saying it would not allow him to raise such ""unnecessary"" things during the arguments on an election petition.

Sahu said those who have necessary qualifications as provided under Article 58 of the Constitution should be allowed to contest and should not be barred merely to get rid of those who were not serious candidates. When the matter had come up before a five-judge bench on last Friday, the court had asked the petitioner whether he was serious in pursuing the petition.

""Are you really serious?"" it had asked.

The Delhi High Court in July this year dismissed a petition filed by Sahu challenging the rejection of his nomination papers for the post of President.

The high court had also imposed a cost of Rs 20,000 on Sahu for filing a writ petition seeking to postpone the polls by interpreting the Supreme Court verdict ""wrongly"".

The high court had said the Supreme Court judgement in a petition, in which election of former President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy was challenged in 1978, was binding on all courts even though the apex court bench, while deciding that case, had functioned as an Election Tribunal.

The high court had dismissed the petition of Sahu saying that it was beyond its jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition against Presidential election.

Sahu had sought postponement of the Presidential election on the ground that the provision of 50 proposers and 50 seconders in the President and Vice-President Election Act was contrary to the Constitutional provisions.

15,Cong accuses govt of lack of consensus on terrorism,"NEW DELHI: Accusing the government of not having a consensus on the issue of cross-border terrorism, the Congress in the Lok Sabha demanded that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee clarify the official government position on it.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Congress Chief Whip P R Dasmunsi quoted Defence Minister George Fernandes as saying in Parliament, in reply to a question, that mobilisation of troops had achieved quite a lot.

Fernandes had reportedly said the mobilisation exerted military pressure on Pakistan and forced the Pakistani President to denounce support to ''jehad'' through his speeches of January 12 and May 27.

""Some of the terrorist organisations in Pakistan were banned, some terrorist camps in PoK were closed, their accounts frozen and leaders arrested. The infiltration this year has come down considerably compared to the figures of the corresponding period of the previous year,"" Fernandes was quoted as saying.

Dasmunsi contended that the External Affairs Ministry was giving a different version, saying Pakistan has done nothing to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure operating from its soil.

MEA officials maintained that after an initial dip, infiltration levels had shot up and even increased to the corresponding levels of last year, Dasmunsi quoted from a newspaper report.

MEA figures showed after Musharraf''s May 27 declaration of ending infiltration, there had been an increase in the infiltration level. There were 1,624 incidents after May 27 as compared to 1,403 in the six-month period before that. Dasmunsi said the differing views had created confusion among the people and was only helping the Pakistan President.

""Government cannot keep quiet on this issue,"" he said demanding that the Prime Minister come to the House and clarify the situation.

As the Congress member persisted with his demands, Speaker Manohar Joshi requested Law Minister K Jana Krishnamurthy, who was present in the House, to bring the matter to the notice of the Prime Minister.

16,Wipro developmnt Centre in Finland,"BANGALORE: Software major Wipro on Friday announced the opening of its new development centre in Finland, its first in Nordic countries.

""Wipro is the first technology company to invest in Finland,"" a company statement said.

The opening of the centre in Tampere is part of an agreement on the expansion and diversification of bilateral economic cooperation which the Finnish Minister for Foreign Trade Jari Vilen signed with the Indian government on his recent trip, it said.

The centre, the statement said, would complement Wipro''s services by addressing issues which need local presence. Typically, it said, Wipro conducts 70 per cent of its work for European customers in India and the other 30 per cent at more local development centres.

Apart from Tampere, there are two other European development centres in Kiel (Germany) and Reading (Britain), it noted.

Sudip Nandy, head of Wipro EMEA, said the northern European investment is the first of its kind from an India-based IT services company and said it was part of the company strategy to offer a global execution model by combining a next door presence with the cost savings associated with India.

17,Ineligible law students allowed to take exams,"New Delhi: Law students whose promotion to the next class was stopped because of their not clearing a minimum number of papers and short attendance, have been provisionally allowed by the Delhi high court to take their exams starting Monday.

However, a division bench comprising Justice Anil Dev Singh and Justice Mukul Mudgal made it clear that the result of the exams would be subject to the outcome of the PIL filed by a law professor against the truant students.

But it was not clear whether the Bench also ordered that the results would be withheld till the judgment is passed.

Peeved by students pestering teachers to give them an exam I-card without even passing the minimum number of papers and attending a minimum number of lectures, law faculty professor S N Singh moved the high court to put a clamp on the practice. In an ex-parte order, the court stayed the promotion of these students.

The law professor alleged that promotions to the second and third years of the LLB course being given by other law centres, was in violation of rules framed by the Bar Council of India (BCI), the governing body for legal education in the country.

Singh, who heads the Law Centre-II of the university, alleged that the 143 students belonging to the other two law centres had been promoted despite failing to clear a minimum five out of 10 papers in the first year and 15 out of 20 papers in the second year.

18,Stock scam accused held while travelling incognito,"KOLKATA: Absconding stock-broker and Poddar Group of Company chairman Ashok Kumar Poddar, wanted in connection with the Rs 120 crore scam at Calcutta Stock Exchange, was arrested at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport on Thursday night, deputy commissioner (detective department) Soumen Mitra said on Friday.

Poddar was taken into the detective department custody as he flew into the city from Guwahati travelling on a false indentity, Mitra said. His ticket was booked in the name of A K Agarwal.

Since the beginning of investigation on September 24, Poddar and his wife Prema were fleeing from one city to another to evade police dragnet.

â€œThey travelled to Rajasthan, then Mumbai and eventually to different north eastern states,â€� Mitra added. Prema, however, is still absconding.

Poddar was one of the four prime accused to have been arrested in the scam. The other two prime accused Harish Chander Biyani and Dinesh Kumar Singhania, former president of CSE, were arrested on September 23 and November 20 respectively. Dinesh Dalmia is still at large.

The total number of arrests in the case has gone up to 17 and include former CEO and MD of Stock Holding Corporation of India B V Gaud, a senior vice-president of Indusind Bank S N Paul and former MD of Srei Securities, Dinesh Jain.

Former vice-president of CSE, K K Daga was arrested on charges of not acting promptly despite being informed by IndusInd bank about return of cheques issued by the three prime accused and their firms in March 2001. Paul was charged with delaying by two days passing of information to CSE after cheques issued by the three were dishonoured. He was also charged with conspiring with Gaud and Biyani with the motive to dupe the exchange.

19,Senior citizens feel polls have lost glory,"SURAT: Gone are the days when elections used to be brain teasing sessions for the common voter over poll issues and candidates. For many old-timers in the silk city, the whole process of elections has been reduced to mere choosing of representatives, without really being a part of the process.

It is not surprising that public meetings, which form a part of the election campaign, no longer casts a spell on the audience. ""Gone are the times, when poll issues and stature of candidates used to evoke an enthusiastic response amongst the masses,"" says 67-year-old Ashwin Pathak who is a retired school teacher.

For many senior citizens of the diamond city, polls are no longer major events. Even names of contesting candidates are not known to many of the elders.

""Though many feel agitated over issues ranging from economics to terrorism, they know that no candidate would even bother about their views,"" says Arun Jariwala (65), a â€˜jariâ€™ manufacturer from Bhagal.

""The elections have become something through which politicians pursue their own interests. In such a scenario, one feels that he has lost his status as a citizen,"" says 74-year-old retired professor T K Gadiwala.

Supporting this view 65-year-old Manilal Mehta of Athwalines says, ""The infighting over nominations and the blatant use of money and muscle have left parties without committed party workers and all those involved in electioneering have some vested interest to pursue.""

20,"BJP worker held for rioting, freed on bail","VADODARA: The Karelibaug police arrested former municipal councillor and BJP worker Sadanand Desai on Friday for his alleged involvement in cases of rioting in the aftermath of the Godhra carnage. He was later released on bail by a city court.

According to police sources, Desai was arrested under section 436 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). His name had cropped up during investigations into rioting incidents that took place in the city. However, Desai was yet to be arrested by the police.

On Friday afternoon, the police finally arrested Desai and presented him before the court. The issue had raked up a major controversy with senior BJP leaders, including Raopura assembly seat candidate Yogesh Patel and city unit president Shabdasharan Brahmbhatt, among others, reaching the police station to protest against the move.

Desai is said to have a good clout in the Salatwada and neighbouring areas of the Raopura constituency. He is believed to be close to Patel and was expected to play a key role in his election campaign.

During the riots, Desai had made aggressive representations along with women when the police had come to arrest some persons of his locality.

Patel and others objected to the arrest saying that the police was deliberately raking up the issue on the eve of the polls. However, police officers countered them by saying that the arrest was part of the usual course followed during investigations.

""Desai''s name had appeared in connection with several rioting cases. He had to be arrested some day. We were only performing our duties,"" said Karelibaug police inspector G S Khera. Top police officials said that the arrest was part of the move to gear up for the polls.

""There are many more persons to be arrested. We will round up as many of them as possible before the polls. This will ensure that law and order is maintained in the city,"" said deputy commissioner of police (north) K S Bhati.
