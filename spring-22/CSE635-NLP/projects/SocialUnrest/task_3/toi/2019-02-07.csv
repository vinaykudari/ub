0,Stamp paper racket: BJP plans statewide protest,"bangalore: the bjp on wednesday accused the state government of trying to sweep the stamp paper racket under the carpet with an eye on the kanakapura byelection, and announced a five-day statewide dharna from thursday to protest against it. ``an emergency meeting of the state executive committee was called on tuesday to discuss the recent events and a decision was taken to intensify our agitation, specially against the government's lackadaisical approach,'' state bjp president basavaraj patil sedam said. the party will also boycott or hold black flag demonstrations at all functions and government events attended by tourism minister r. roshan baig for his alleged involvement in the racket. sedam said his party felt the government is trying to turn the issue into an inconsequential one. ``the investigation and chargesheet are just superficial; just to pull wool over everyone's eyes. the government is now citing the special court for any queries, but we never asked for it. we want a cbi inquiry and we will keep pressing for it.'' the bjp will also raise the issues of stoppage of drought relief work despite severe drought conditions in many areas, crop insurance for farmers, the power situation and rural weightage.

1,ID cards will spoil Cong's proxy voting party: JD(S),"bangalore: the jd(s) on wednesday criticised the congress for opposing the election commission (ec)'s directive to the electorate to show identity cards to vote for the kanakapura bypoll. legislative council opposition leader k.h. srinivas and party secretary-general c. narayanaswamy felt it strange on the part of congress which swears by democracy, free and fair polls, to oppose i-cards. ``congress is not happy by ec's decision because it cannot indulge in large-scale proxy voting,'' narayanaswamy maintained. reminding the congress that the ec's decision is not confined to kanakapura, narayanaswamy said even the supreme court has expressed its opinion in favour of identity cards in elections. ``let the congress say if it has respect to judicial pronouncements,'' he added. he urged the ec to conduct trial voting by electronic voting machines (evms) in different parts of the constituency several days before february 21 to enable villagers to learn how to vote. ``jd(s) is prepared to bear the expenses,'' he added. srinivas took exception to the intemperate and foul language used by bjp mlc b.s. yediurappa against former prime minister h.d. deve gowda. ``bjp should be blamed for taking the quality of campaign to an all time low in terms of language, tone and tenor. i am ashamed to repeat yediyurappa's words which he uttered in a public meeting at malavalli but it shows his character and frustration,'' he stated.

4,Grain policy to push up farmers' profits,"new delhi: the centre hopes its removal of restrictions on the movement and stocking of wheat and rice will not only help their availability in areas of scarcity but also help farmers get better prices for their produce. the centre also hopes free trade of wheat, rice, paddy, sugar, coarse grains, edible oilseeds and edible oils will bring about their price stabilisation and give an impetus both to the agricultural sector and the food processing industry. as for sugar, its free movement is just one of the measures the government is planning to move towards its total decontrol. this is hoped to be achieved after the futures and forward trading market starts operating during 2002-03. at a press briefing on wednesday, consumer affairs and public distribution minister shanta kumar said even after decontrol, sugar would continue to be supplied to the below poverty line (bpl) families under the public distribution system. on tuesday, the government relaxed controls on foodgrain and other goods under the essential commodities act, 1955. traders would now no longer require any licences to stock, trade in and transport as also buy and sell these commodities. kumar said these steps were taken in view of economic liberalisation and the abundant availability of foodgrain. ""the restrictions were imposed in a situation of scarcity. now that there is a surplus, such restrictions only hamper free trade,"" he said. with a whopping 227 orders by states restricting trade in wheat, rice, paddy and other items, the centre initially sought to persuade them to reach a consensus. the issue was discussed at the chief ministers' conference in may 2001 and later in the standing committee comprising central ministers and chief ministers. a consensus on removing these controls did emerge, but concrete measures were not taken. after the cms failed to respond to his two letters, the centre decided to act on its own. kumar said all states will have to adhere to the order. if any state, for any reason, feels the need for curbs, it will have to seek the centre's permission. the centre, however, is treading carefully on sugar decontrol. it is taking gradual measures following the 1978 experience when after decontrolling sugar the then government retraced the step because a mechanism was not in place. the centre now plans to rationalise sugarcane prices, improve the viability of sugar mills, help increase sugar exports by giving millers the actual cost of transportation from the mill to the ports, and set up three exchanges for futures trading in sugar.

7,Kanshi remote-controls polls,"jalandhar:there was no visible poll-related activity around this house in basant vihar in urban estate here where the bsp supremo kanshi ram has been camping for the last 13 months to galvanise the party which has barely managed to send one mla to the state assembly in the last elections. only a party flag on the car standing outside the house indicates presence of some bsp leader. however, the usual rush of party activists and leaders and the buzz associated with the election campaign was clearly missing. 'manyavar' (kanshi ram) is taking rest and can't meet anybody at this hour,' was the curt reply of the man who responded to door bell as it was already 9.30 pm. he suggested he better come in the morning to have a chat. the scene was the same at 9 am too. there were not more than five persons in the house besides security men. kanshi ram was still in his bed room on the first floor. this correspondent was escorted to his room by his secretary but sans shoes. none is permitted to take shoes to his bedroom except himself. kanshi ram was still in nightsuit. completely relaxed. certainly, he was in no hurry, unlike most politicians, who on election eve are eager to have the benefit of being early birds. apparently he was monitoring the campaign from his bedroom itself and was giving directions, more often pulling up party activists and candidates on phone itself. exuding confidence, kanshi ram said the party would form government on its own. on reminding that he had made similar claims in the past too but his party could merely open its account last time, kanshi ram said this time he had been in punjab for the last one year and this has made the real difference.

9,Parties do their bit to criminalise politics,"pune: the rot set in a long time ago and it seems like a hopeless case now. despite newspapers and news channels profiling history-sheeters and persons with criminal records contesting as party candidates for the forthcoming assembly polls in uttar pradesh and punjab, the political-criminal nexus continues to flourish. and not just in the bad lands either. almost all major political parties in pune have fielded candidates with criminal records for the forthcoming civic polls. since none of these candidates have been convicted of the criminal charges filed against them - some have been acquitted, others have cases pending - they are eligible to contest under election commission rules. there are around a dozen candidates in the fray, including seven sitting corporators, against whom serious offences such as murder, kidnapping and extortion have been registered. sitting corporator and congressman anil jadhav, better known as 'anya don' is contesting from panel 38 (parvati). an offence of attempt to murder was registered against him at the sahakarnagar police station in 1990, and he has also been charged with rioting. he faces a tough challenge from nationalist congress party (ncp) candidate mahesh mengde who has two cases of murder pending against him. the cream of the pack is independent sitting corporator from rasta peth power house (panel no. 34) razzak khan akbar khan who has the maximum number of police charges against him - an amazing 20. his anticipatory bail was recently rejected by the bombay high court which has asked him to surrender to the police after the polls. the accusations range from robbery (3 cases), abduction (2) extortion (3) and seven cases of grievous injury. several other hopefuls in the polls have been under investigation - or still are - for routine crimes such as robbery, dacoity, kidnapping, but congress candidate from sadhana vidyalya, panel no.4, kiran hole, has been booked by the hadpsar and wanowrie police in as many as three cases of outraging the modesty of women. and the independent candidate from panel 8 (bhopodi) madhukar prabhakar, seems to have a penchant for entering other people's houses unasked; he has 21 offences of house breaking registered against him at the khadki police station.

12,Jyoti Basu reprimands chief minister,"kolkata: former west bengal chief minister jyoti basu admonished present incumbent buddhadeb bhattacharjee on wednesday for his reported remark that a section of unrecognised madrasahs in the state were involved in anti-national activities. at the left front meeting held during the day in kolkata, basu advised bhattacharjee to admit that he had made a mistake by making such a remark. while bhattacharjee denied having ever made such a comment and blamed the media, including his party organ ganashakti, for distorting his statement, basu reportedly told him curtly, ""you have made a mistake. you should admit it."" the chief minister faced flak even from the left front partners, who felt that his reported statement on madrasahs resulted in alienating a large number of muslims from the left. when bhattacharjee tried to explain that even his party organ ganashakti had misquoted him, cpi state secretary manju majumdar reportedly asked him, ""what prevented you from correcting the mistake? what took you so long to find out that you were wrongly quoted by the media?"" while the chief minister fumbled, cpm state secretary anil biswas and left front chairman biman bose admitted that it had indeed been a grave mistake. the controversy was allowed to snowball and should have been nipped in the bud, they agreed. the left front decided that ganashakti would immediately carry a correction and the chief minister would give a detailed interview to the paper explaining that he had nothing against the madrasahs. no madrasah was involved in terrorist activities, he would say in the interview. the chief minister, however, turned down a proposal of the forward bloc, which had suggested that the state government should take over all unrecognised madrasahs and introduce modern education there, doing away the theological components from their curricula. ""i can't legally prevent people from pursuing religious studies,"" he said. it was also decided at the left front meeting that a booklet would be brought out, explaining the state government's stand on the madrasahs and the state of the muslims in west bengal. front chairman biman bose took pains to explain after the meeting the commendable work done by the state government for the muslims and for modernisation of madrasah education. while explaining the cause of the delay in pointing out that the chief minister had been misquoted by the media, bose said most of the front partners had been busy with their respective party conferences and expected that the people would understand that the state government had no malicious intentions against any minority community. sharply reacting to home minister l.k. advani's reported praise of the west bengal chief minister in curbing anti- national activities in the madrasahs, bose said that advani was praising bhattacharjee to serve his own political interests. ""advani is aiding fundamentalist rss, vhp and bajrang dal. it is a pity that he now comes in support of bhattacharjee. he has his own political interests in doing so,"" bose said.

17,CAG makes SAIL change `flying rules',"patna: apparently in response to the severe indictment by the comptroller and auditor general (cag) in its 1999 report, the steel authority of india ltd (sail) has revised its guidelines of 1994 for use of the company aircraft. the revised guidelines, approved in a recent meeting of the company's board of directors, once again prohibit the company aircraft's use for purposes other than the company's business. the cag report pointed out serious lapses in utilisation of the aircraft. top sail executives, it said, twisted rules to suit their personal interests and allowed ""outsiders"", including politicians, government officials and cricketers, to fly by these planes. the original rules said dependents could accompany officials in the aircraft with permission from competent authority. sail had a fleet of aircraft: while one plane (vt-eqd) was with the bokaro steel plant, the research and development centre for iron and steel (rdcis) had two planes (vt-doq and vt-dor). the bhilai steel plant had one plane (vt-elz) while the indian iron and steel company had two planes (vt-dmq and vt-dmr). however, only the bokaro steel aircraft is presently functional with others either having been grounded or having crashed. the planes were purchased with a view to facilitating speedy movement of senior officials of the company for the company's work. between 1992 and 1998, the cag observed, 34 passengers comprising dependents of the sail officers were specified as official passengers and an exclusive flight was also arranged for them. norms were flouted to the extent that the aircraft was used by the bokaro steel executive director and his spouse even when they went on ""liberalised leave travel concession (lltc)"" tour. also, the plane was used for medical treatment of top officials' spouses. the new guidelines have prohibited exclusive use of the aircraft for unofficial purposes by any person or organisation. interestingly, according to the earlier guidelines, a sail official, competent to permit dependents in the company's plane, did not need to seek permission from a higher authority to take his spouse or children in the plane. indicting such officials for favouring their kin in the name of public interest, the cag report advised sail to include a clause in the guidelines making approval from a higher authority mandatory. the new rules define a competent authority who can grant permission to non-entitled persons as the chairman, vice-chairman, director/md and chief executive of sail plants where the plane is based. the rules also stipulate that in case of travel by the spouse or children of a board level officer, approval of the chairman would be mandatory. the company, on the recommendations of the cag, also revised the charges to be levied on use of aircraft by non-entitled persons from an amount equivalent to first class rail fare to ac first class fare.

18,HC censures govt for highway encroachments,"patna: a division bench of the patna high court comprising chief justice ravi s dhavan and justice shashank k singh on tuesday censured the state government for allowing encroachments along the highways. the judges read out the relevant laws and rules to which the government has paid ""scant attention"" and asked it to ensure their strict adherence for smooth flow of the traffic. hearing a case filed by krishnadeo kumar in connection with the alleged illegal construction of a market by the municipality at madhepura on state government roads, the judges stressed the need for adhering to the regulations regarding width, setbacks and removal of encroachments along roads. government counsel alamdar hussain was hard put to defend the ""indolence"" of the government. counsel for the madhepura municipality jitendra singh submitted that the town is small and that it will not require such wide roads. justice dhavan observed that it is not a question of small or big town but of keeping the communication channel open. justice dhavan read out portions of the ""geometric design standards guidelines for roads"" filed on affidavit by hussain, which clearly mention the land width, width between building lines and width between control lines, both in urban and rural areas. the guidelines state that the width of national and state highways has to be normally 45 metres in rural areas and 30 metres in urban ones. the distance between two buildings on the opposite sides of road cannot be less than 80 metres in plain and rolling country. the exhaustive standard lays down a comprehensive plan for roads in urban and rural areas and the way they should be planned. even access points on national highways are required to be planned, the guidelines add. the guidelines lay down the norms for regulating building activities along arterial highways. they envisage appointment of estate officers for removal of encroachments on roads as advised under the public premises (eviction of unauthorised occupants) act, 1971. the judges referred to the provisions in the guidelines, which advocate use of the crpc and ipc for removal of encroachments from public roads. replying to a query of the bench, hussain admitted that the government has not yet sent the guidelines to the districts. justice dhavan observed that this is wrong and that the government should get the guidelines published in newspapers soon for the general public. hussain readily agreed with the chief justice's observation.

""the face of bihar is as scarred and ugly as mine,"" says the victim, mani mohan, scornfully. he retired as the dean of bvc on january 31 this year. ""these burn scars are what i got as a reward at the end of my career. despite my sincere efforts to enforce discipline on the campus, i'm a defeated man today,"" observes mohan, who had already sustained 40 per cent burn injuries when rain came to his rescue. since the fateful day, he has been facing the twin problems of meeting the medical expenses, close to rs 1.75 lakh, and dealing all alone with the threats of dire consequences if he pursues the case or speaks to the press. the administration did provide him with a bodyguard in the beginning, but after a few weeks, that guard simply vanished. a free caller id on his telephone is all that he has in the name of ""security measures"" these days. and then the police nag: ""the complainant himself is not interested in going ahead with the case."" dsp ajit kumar sinha of the sachivalaya police station sounds generous enough, ""yes, i don't know why principal saheb is not cooperating. but still, we are leaving no stone unturned to book the culprits. we'll review the case after receiving the progress report from investigating officer p k biswas."" one hopes the police do not find any stone too `heavy' to turn. is mohan satisfied with the penalty slapped on the students? ""they were not my students. i recognise all the 18 students of the '98 batch. it's totally unjust to slap a general fine without identifying the real culprits."" besides, it will only promote such incidents if the guilty are allowed to go scot-free after paying just two thousand rupees, he says. now, if they were not the '98 batch bvc students infuriated at the denial of use of unfair means in the examination, who were they, anyway? mohan throws an oblique hint suggesting designs to oust him -- he was still in hospital when he heard about his being replaced as the principal! however, what hurts him most is the lack of appreciation from any quarter for his attempts to promote a noble cause. ""nobody is even bothered to endorse my zeal to create an environment conducive for proper education,"" he says, adding that the university gave him rs 35,000 for treatment, and of course, an assurance to reimburse his medical bills, but ""once out of service, it is a doubtful proposition"". ""now i've left it to the youngsters to decide whether they should practise honesty and uprightness in their life... no lessons from me,"" says the man shuttling between delhi's safdarjung hospital and patna.

23,Enron lawyer questioned off-the-book deals,"washington: immediately after he was hired, an enron attorney became so concerned about obscure partnerships the company was using to conceal debt that he raised a string of objections in an attempt to rein them in. the uneasiness of ex-enron lawyer jordan mintz is detailed in five memos released on the eve of a thursday house committee hearing whose other star witness will be former enron chief executive jeff skilling, who let the partnerships proceed. in the senate, democratic senator ernest hollings and republican ted stevens on wednesday urged their leaders to set up a single select committee for the chamber's investigation because so many panels are investigating enron. four enron executives with knowledge of the partnerships were to be witnesses at the house hearing, but would invoke their fifth amendment right not to testify, said ken johnson, spokesman for the house energy and commerce committee. the four, who would all be present, include andrew fastow, who was at the center of off-the-books deals involving the partnerships, said johnson. skilling, who will testify, said that he knew little about the details of partnership deals that eventually plunged enron into bankruptcy. the memos show that mintz insisted skilling signed off on the arrangements before they could proceed. in the case of one partnership, six people signed an approval sheet, but the line next to skilling's typed name is blank. two of the people who signed the sheet, rick buy and rick causey, were among the people refusing to testify, said johnson.
