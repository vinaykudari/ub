0,Adik moots 7-point plan for farm aid,"MUMBAI: Agriculture minister Govindrao Adik, who has been touring rural Maharashtra ever since he took charge of the not-so-glamorous department four months ago, has been advocating a seven-point programme to protect marginal farmers from the vagaries of the rain gods and forces of the open market. Once, senior politicians vied for the agriculture portfolio. Now, no one wants it, even though it affects vote banks in their constituencies. This is because key functions such as dairy development, water conservation and soil conservation have been taken away from the agriculture department, leaving with it four agriculture universities and extension work. But Mr Adik, a former president of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee, refuses to let this get him down. His first priority, he said, is to ensure that marginal farmers get insurance protection, because they are vulnerable to climatic conditions and the swings of local markets. He has devised a new insurance scheme and wants the state government to take it up with the Union government. Mr Adik also is advocating cheap organic farming. He has been telling farmers to depend more on indigenous seeds, natural fertilisers and to use traditional methods of storing agriculture produce to cut down on production costs. He is devising a mass-contact programme to educate farmers. The department is planning to change the cropping pattern to ensure the best use of water, natural resources and crop varieties developed by agriculture universities. Mr Adik is also planning to set up a Maharashtra Agriculture Industries Development Corporation.

3,Dawood men arrested in city,"LUCKNOW: The trans-Gomti police on Thursday arrested two persons linked with the Dubai-based don Dawood Ibrahim who had executed a kidnapping in the state capital in January this year. The arrest came on the basis of the information provided by Shahdab, an Agra-based henchman of 'Bhai' - a Middle East based don, who was rounded up in Agra on Wednesday following information from the Gujarat police. Shahdab, an exporter, had informed the sleuths that with the help of two youths from Lucknow, he got kidnapped the son of a Public Works Department (PWD) Engineer Ghanshyam Verma residing in Indiranagar locality. The catch was taken to Kanpur an adjoining district and held captive for two days before he gave his abductors a slip and escaped. On the basis of this information, the trans-Gomati police on Thursday raided a house in Vikas Nagar and nabbed four youths who had allegedly contributed their bit in the kidnapping case. They were identified as Arif and his friend Naseem, both residents of Behta locality in Gudumba area of the state capital. During interrogation, Arif revealed that it was during his stay in Saudi Arabia for seven years that he met Shahdab and came in contact with Bhai on telephone. Thereafter he returned to Lucknow but remained in touch with Shahdab who once asked him to suggest names for a probable target. As Arif was known to Ghanshyam Verma who had got some embroidery work done through the former and had to pay Rs 6500 to him for the job, Arif suggested his son Raju Verma's name. Thereafter posing as Raju's friend Saurabh, Arif called him up on phone on January 8 and invited him for a match of cricket. As Raju did not have a conveyance, Arif directed him to reach the Ring Road where his friends would accompany him in a car. When Raju reached the ring road he met four youths in cricket kits carrying bats and pads. An unsuspecting Raju got into the car and was taken to Kanpur where Arif and his aide Naseem were dropped by the gang. Naseem was lured to contribute in the crime in exchange of Rs 25000 in cash which he needed as his sister was to get married. After Arif and Naseem were left in Kanpur Shahdab along with Taiyyab and Haron took Raju to Etah from where he reportedly managed to escape and reached home safely. Parents of Raju did not get a case registered in connection with the incident. Though the accused and the victim claimed that no ransom was paid, police said that there were possibilities of money to have exchanged hands. However, the entire network was smashed on Tuesday when Taiyyab and Haron were nabbed in Surat and revealed the name of Shahdab during interrogation. Thereafter a joint police team from Gujarat and UP rounded up Shahdab from Agra on Wednesday following which he revealed names of his other associates Arif and Naseem who were arrested in Lucknow on Thursday.

4,Money meant for minister seized,"LUCKNOW: After the Madhumita murder case involving the then government printing press minister Amarmani Tripathi, another embarrassment appeared to be in the making for the Mayawati government when two persons arrested with over Rs 10 lakh said that the cash was for a minister. The two were arrested from a city hotel on Thursday and the cash was recovered from their possession. The cash, according to the two accused, belonged to a basic shiksha adhikari (BSA). Allegedly meant for a BSP minister, it was said to be a part of collection from the candidates appearing for recruitment as teachers in the Shiksha Mitra Yojna Scheme. The catch was made during a routine checking of hotels and hostels in search of any outstation suspicious guests. The police bumped into two youths lodged in room number 105 at Ram Krishna Guest House on Park Road, in the Hazratganj police circle, during the small hours of Thursday. What made the police suspicious was the recovery of stacks of currency notes in all denominations stuffed in a dirty looking bag. When the two failed to provide any satisfactory details about the source of cash, they were brought to the Hazratganj police station. The two were identified as Satyendra Kumar Singh and Harish Chandra Rajbhar, both from Gorakhpur. While Satyendra claimed that he was a close relative of the minister for primary education Ram Achal Rajbhar, Harish stated that he was a peon at the Gorakhpur office of the district primary education department and that he got the job with the minister's help in April last. Efforts to contact the minister proved futile. The two told the police that the cash recovered from their possession, Rs 10, 60,700 belonged to the BSA, Basti, Ramesh Singh who also has the charge of Gorakhpur region. Harish said that as he was a peon and Ramesh Singh his boss, he was just discharging the orders of his superior and had no knowledge of the cash. He said that the BSA had called him on Wednesday and directed him to accompany Satyendra to Lucknow. The BSA paid for the taxi and arranged for the hotel room. Police contacted the BSA on phone. He said that he would come to Lucknow and answer the queries of the police in detail. Recovery of application forms related to appointment of teachers from the possession of the two accused and hand-written letters of recommendation addressed to the BSA and signed by Rajesh Singh, who mentioned his designation as public relations officer (PRO) to the minister of primary education were also recovered. The letters spoke about getting the work related to Shiksha Mitra Scheme to be done in favour of the bearer of the letter. See also page 3

5,The politics of golf,"LUCKNOW: Misuse of power vested by virtue of an official post has become an essential ingredient in the recipe of success in election processes, be it for a political hot seat or a coveted chair in a club. I have no qualms about using my bureaucratic influence, was a nonchalant declaration made by IAS officer Prabhat C Chaturvedi, also elected the secretary of the Lucknow Golf Club for a second consecutive time. Chaturvedi made this statement when queried about a copy of letter received by TOI wherein he appealed to the club members to vote in favour of a few select candidates. Canvassing is thus reduced to no more than a travesty wherein bureaucratic influence is being 'roped in' by various office bearers as the club secretary to solicit votes. But if Chaturvedi as a bureaucrat has no qualms about alleged misuse of his official letter-head, VV Singh, the UP Circle Head (consumer sales) of a telecom company, is doing things no differently as he is alleged to be getting his campaign material printed from his office. But there is a difference. While Chaturvedi sees nothing wrong in what he is doing, Singh flatly denies he is indulging in any such activity. One club member maintained, If it is an honorary post as he claimed in print then why is he trying to bribe the voters with free handsets? But there were others who dismissed these allegations. Devesh Rastogi, the opponent contesting for the same post as Singh, also dismissed these reports as unsubstantiated. It is foolish to splash Singh's name without any basis, Devesh said. When contacted, the election officer, Vijay Dutta agreed with Devesh. Dutta added, I have to remain neutral as an election officer and as far as looking into the matter is concerned the accusations against Singh are baseless allegations. They will in no way affect the election proceedings which culminate on June 1. The allegation that Singh is flouting his company's rules by contesting the elections have been taken seriously by a few club members who have reported the matter to his company's headquarters at Mumbai. The Lucknow Golf Club has thus become the stage for the bigwigs from all walks of life revelling in their favourite game of 'politik' (and golf, of course!). With the unanimous re-election of the club secretary, the election term of the club has been extended to serving term of two years, as opposed to a diminutive length of one year. As various candidates gear up to wrestle for their coveted posts, we await the grand finale!

""We have enough numbers under our belt ... There is no threat to the state government"", BJP legislature party leader Lalji Tandon said. The RLD decision followed a day after Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav held a meeting with Congress President Sonia Gandhi as also Ajit Singh separately as part of efforts to cobble up an alternative to the Mayawati government in UP. Ajit Singh had himself met Gandhi on Wednesday and offered to join forces with the Opposition to topple the BSP-BJP combine. With former chief minister Kalyan Singh already having joined the efforts for such an alternative, Opposition sources claimed it would be only a matter of time before BJP MLAs, disgruntled over the ruling coalition in the state, would switch sides, tilting the balance in their favour.

13,"Shilpa's father's bail plea rejected, arrest eminent","SURAT: The arrest of Surendra Shetty, father of actress Shilpa Shetty, on Friday appeared imminent with a local court rejecting his anticipatory bail plea in a case of alleged extortion registered against him and two others by Gujarat police. Rejecting his bail petition, additional district and sessions judge K M Vin upheld the argument of prosecution that there was prima facie evidence against the accused and hence he should be subjected to custodial interrogation. The court also turned down Surendra's plea for a 15-day stay on its order to enable the accused to file an appeal in Gujarat High Court. Surendra was not present in the court when the order was delivered but was represented by his lawyer. Soon after the order was pronounced, a team of Umra police left for Mumbai to arrest the accused, senior police inspector B V Ramani said. The court had earlier issued non-bailable warrants against Surendra Shetty and his wife Sunanda. they had obtained provisional bail till May 28 and June 12 respectively from a court in Mumbai which ordered them to seek regular bail in a Surat court.

14,Centre rules out Kanchi seer's role in temple issue,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday ruled out the direct involvement of Kanchi Seer Jayendra Saraswati in the Ayodhya peace process for the time being as it did not want him to get embroiled in any controversy even as the pontiff sought to distance himself from the issue saying it had become politicised. ""In my opinion, it is not proper now to involve a person of his stature in the Ayodhya tangle though we would be seeking his blessings at every step,"" Minister of State for Home Swami Chinmayananda said after meeting the pontiff, who arrived here enroute to Leh to attend the Sindhu Darshan Festival. Describing his meeting as a ""courtesy call"", Chinmayananda said there was no proposal at the moment to involve the Kanchi seer.

He, however, did not rule out discussing the issue among other things with the seer in Ladakh. Earlier, on his arrival at the Kamakshi Temple in South-West Delhi, the Shankaracharya said he would keep away from the Ayodhya issue as it has been politicised. ""Now politics has entered. I will keep quiet,"" he said. The pontiff replied in the negative when asked whether he would make a fresh initiative to solve the issue.
