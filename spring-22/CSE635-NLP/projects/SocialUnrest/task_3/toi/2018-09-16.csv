0,'Integrate culture into development process',"ahmedabad: once upon a time, the story goes, an urban developer happened to visit a rustic settlement and spotted two youths lazing under a tree in the morning. the technocrat tried to reason with them and goad them into getting employed. but, the insolent youths shot back: ""by earning money, you would ultimately do what we are already doing - living in comfort."" that is what the chairman of the national book trust of india, dr sitakant mahapatra, says is a fall-out of planning and executing development activities without considering its cultural impact. mahapatra, considered a major voice in modern indian poetry, has a bharatiya gyanpith award and sahitya academy award to his credit, apart from a host of other laurels he has won. besides poetry, he has also authored 50 publications on literature, social anthropology and the arts. mahapatra was in the city on saturday to talk on 'governance of development' as part of the institute lecture series 2001-2002 of the indian institute of management, ahmedabad. mahapatra asserted that development which focuses on technical and capital aspects only, is often found to be wayward, and thus needs to be more people-centric. this, he said, could be achieved by designing development projects incorporating a fusion of culture and lifestyle of the beneficiaries in the project-design. ""much like the environmental impact studies carried out before any development project is implemented, the cultural impact of a project should also be delved into,"" said mahapatra who has also served as an officer in the indian administrative services for 34 years. ""there is no need to shed the prevalent goals of good services and maximising profits with better technology and planning, but cultural identity of any locality should be ingrained into a project, be it in the field of agriculture, health or academics,"" he said, adding that this subject has been taken up internationally by the un and unesco. the benefits of integrating culture into the development process, and thereby ensuring public participation on a larger scale, is already being discussed at international fora. mahapatra asserted: ""instead of building long metalled roads and huge canals - only to find that a section of the countrymen are starving or are unable to tap the irrigation facilities due to project deficiencies - culture should be made the focal point of any development project, thus bringing it closer to the beneficiaries. with involvement of the project-users' ideas, needs and culture while planning, the elusive holistic approach to development will be achieved along with employment generation, all leading to people being happy.""

1,PW reorganises party structure,"hyderabad: in a major policy shift, the outlawed people's war (pw) has reorganised the party structure, forming a seven-member politburo (pb) and another sevenmember central military commission (cmc) to guide the group in its political and military activities. the decision to reorganise the pw organisation structure was taken at an extended conference of the central committee of the naxalite party, intelligence agencies monitoring the pw movements said. according to intelligence officials, the politburo will function as the highest decision-making body of the people's war party. it will guide the regional bureaus, different sub-committees and the cmc. the pw operates in andhra pradesh, chattisgarh, jharkhand, parts of maharasthra, orissa, bihar, karnataka, west bengal and other northern states. the cmc, headed by pw central committee secretary muppala laksman rao alias ganapathy, formulates military policy, which will be implemented by the new people's guerrilla army. it is wrested with the responsibility of procurement and supply of arms to the underground cadre. the officials said the pw has also formed five regional bureaus to guide the cadre at state levels. while the central regional bureau will guide the party in north telangana, dandakaranya, andhra-orissa border (aob) committees, the ap bureau will monitor the activities in the rest of andhra pradesh. the eastern regional bureau will guide the pw cadre in bihar, jharkhand, bengal and orissa, while southwestern bureau will monitor the party in maharashtra, tamil nadu, karnataka and kerala. the north india bureau is in charge of delhi,haryana,punjab anduttarakhand. for the first time, the pw has also set up a central publishing bureau with three central committee members to carry out publicity campaign on behalf of the party. it has also formed sub-committees for taking up a women's movement to build women's organisations at the national level. senior intelligence officials link the stepped-up offensive of the pw cadre to the reorganisation of the party network. the recent attacks on politicians, police and others shows pw leadership intends to keep its flock together and assure the cadre the party is on the right path of revolution,'' the officials said.

2,Concern over unrestricted flow of Nepalese goods into India,"patna: the leader of the opposition in the bihar assembly, sushil kumar modi, has, in a letter to the prime minister, voiced concern over ""unrestricted flow"" of nepalese goods into india, particularly into bihar, through the long indo-nepal border along the state. in the letter, bjp leader modi said, ""unhindered and unrestricted import of raw materials from india and export of finished goods to this country by nepal at cheaper rates under the indo-nepal trade treaty are causing serious problems for the industries located in bihar and other indian states adjacent to nepal."" the domestic industries located in these areas have suffered huge losses as a result of which some units have already been closed and many others are on the verge of closure, he maintained. pointing out ""lacunae"" in the indo-nepal trade treaty, modi told the pm that a number of manufacturing units producing steel tubes and other things have been set up in nepal in the areas adjacent to bihar and uttar pradesh. apart from black and galvanised steel pipes, vegetable oil and polypropylene manufacturing units on the indian side have also been adversely affected. as there are hardly any taxes such as excise and customs duty in nepal, the units in that country are in a position to procure raw materials at very cheap rates from international markets. even ""our steel authority of india ltd is supplying steel to the units in nepal at a very low price as materials imported by nepal do not entail excise duty or sales tax,"" he said, adding that as a result of this the price of finished pipes of nepal is lower than the cost of raw materials available in india. modi said the units in nepal are selling their products not only in bihar and other bordering areas of india but also at far off places like indore, mumbai and bangalore at cheaper rates. pleading for urgent corrective steps to allow indian industrial units to survive, he said, ""the goodwill gesture of the indian government to help nepal has proved detrimental to the interest of domestic industries."" if the inflow of nepalese goods is not checked immediately, the domestic industries would be forced to close down rendering a large number of people unemployed in these areas and crores of rupees invested in non-performing assets locked up causing a heavy loss of revenue to the government, he warned.

3,"Of marriage, love and incest","dhanbad: it was like a scene taken out straight from a c-grade english movie. the female and male characters repeatedly swore to live and die together. and passions ran high when the woman, apparently to show her love for the man, hugged him in full public view and punched a lasting kiss on his lips even as the viewers muttered ""shame, shame"". the scene was enacted at the dhansar police station of the district on wednesday and the viewers included dsp (law and order) a k satyarthi, inspector akhilesh parmar and dhansar police station officer-in-charge (oc) anjani kumar besides the family members of the male character, some journalists and, last but not the least, the woman's hapless husband. the lovelorn characters were father-in-law and daughter-in-law. the matter was brought to the police station by birendra pandey who wanted to get his wife, indu devi, freed from the clutches of his father, haru pandey. all present in the police station were persuading haru and indu to give up the socially unacceptable path, but to no avail. the woman was not ready to go with her husband. ""we love each other and we do not care for the society,"" she said, adding they have even renamed themselves as akash and chanda. haru, a native of ajamgarh in up, is an employee in the tetulmari colliery here and has two sons and a married daughter from his legally married wife, asha devi. his eldest son, birendra, was married to indu in 1993 and they have two sons. birendra later went to mumbai to earn a livelihood and, in his absence back home, his wife and his father developed an illicit relationship. when haru's wife, asha, resisted, he packed her off to ajamgarh. when birendra returned to take back his wife on tuesday, his father and wife refused to acknowledge him and allegedly tried to assault him with an iron rod. birendra sought help from police and it took a whole day for the police and others, including the family members, to convince the elderly man and the young woman that their relation was illicit and will have a bad impact on the future of the family's children. according to oc kumar, after much persuasion, the woman reluctantly agreed to go with her husband. subsequently, they were released from the police station on thursday noon.

4,Amin to be acting chief minister,"kolkata: the number two man in the buddhadeb bhattacharjee ministry, nirupam sen, will not officiate as the acting chief minister during bhattacharjee's weeklong tour to japan. neither will the number-three man, surya kanta misra, get a chance. instead, the number four man, mohammed amin, will take charge during bhattacharjee's absence. while the politically significant decision was announced by chief secretary manish gupta at writers' buildings with the cpm officially trying to pass it off as routine and non-controversial, the inner core of the party was abuzz, trying to fathom the political consequences. several top cpm leaders, including one state committee member, saw in the decision one more indication that writers' buildings and alimuddin street were not on the same political wave-length. though the choice of amin was unanimous in the state secretariat of the cpm, which met earlier in the day, insiders pointed out that it was a mere formality and the real implications lay elsewhere. nirupam sen should have been the obvious choice as the acting chief minister during buddhada's absence, as he is number two in the cabinet, a state committee member said. at least suryada could have been chosen, he argued. the cpm leader stressed that the dropping of sen and misra, both known to be conservative marxists and close to the alimuddin street bosses, indicated that bhattacharjee was determined to push through his pro-industry agenda much to the chagrin of his more hard-line comrades. sen, the state industry minister, has reportedly failed to appreciate the chief minister's views on the industrial front on several occasions. the choice of the chief minister's companions for his japan trip was also not without any debate, insiders pointed out. amin saheb is one person in the cabinet who nourishes no further ambition to rise either in the party or in the ministry, said a cpm leader with a wink. cpm state secretary anil biswas, however, dismissed all speculation on the issue saying that amin was selected because he was a senior member of the cabinet.

""no one should be asked to vacate a house due to political vendetta,"" tekriwal said on friday while reacting on media reports regarding the move to get ex-ministers vacate their bungalows. tekriwal said that it was common knowledge that ministerial houses had been allotted on various pretexts, like security and even pending marriages. such allotments should be cancelled, he said, and pointed out that ex-ministers who had resigned from the ministry in 1997 were yet to be allotted alternative accommodation. tekriwal referred to the allotment of a huge bungalow made to rjd chief laloo prasad yadav, who is merely an mla. the house was allotted to laloo after an ex-chief secretary was pressurised to vacate it, he added. while laloo had been chief minister for over seven years, there are many who have been ministers for 14 years, tekriwal said. ""i offer to quit my ministerial house if laloo is made to vacate his government bungalow,"" he added.

7,Expert calls for strong steps to curb growing incidence of cancer,"pune: despite the efforts of government and private medical research centres, almost 5.5 lakh people died of cancer in the country in 2000. and appears that without better public education, better clinical trials and infrastructure, cancer will continue to be the biggest non-communicable disease in india. k.a. dinshaw, director of the tata memorial centre in mumbai, speaking at a national seminar on 'oncology and urology update' organised by the command hospital, pune, succinctly explained the the current status of cancer in the country. a majority of the cancers in india were cervical, breast or tobaccorelated. in 2000, more than eight lakh cancer cases were reported.while cases of cervical cancer were the highest, tobacco-related and breast cancer followed in that order, she said. she advocated strong measures to control tobacco-related cancer, like introduction of low nicotine smoking products and tobacco crop substitution, besides stricter legislative controls.while there were more cases of prostrate and bladder cancers in developed countries, in developing countries stomach and liver cancers, occurred more often. expressing satisfaction over efforts of the government, which has given enough impetus to the national cancer control programme, ms dinshaw said, in the '80s, several medical colleges set up full-fledged oncology departments.another good development was the establishment of cancer registries which provided lot of data to researchers, oncology surgeons and planners to take preventive measures. implementation of cancer control programme at state and district levels in the early '90s was also a positive step, she added, but said it was unfortunate that many ngos did not know about the financial assistance available to them for undertaking cancer control programmes in semi-urban and rural areas. ms dinshaw said there was a lack of expert and experienced oncologists and radiotherapists.although the number of comprehensive cancer centres cccs) has gone up to 17 in the country, the infrastructure was still inadequate, looking at the size and complexity of the disease. new age cccs should concentrate on more clinical trials, training clinical scientists, developing cost-effective protocols and tissue repository banks, she added.

9,"Presence of Dawood, aides in Karachi becomes embarrassment to Pak govt.","mumbai: the presence of dawood ibrahim, tiger memon and their associates in karachi has now become a major embarrassment for the musharraf government in pakistan.all these persons are wanted for masterminding the serial bomb blasts which rocked mumbai in march, 1993. sources in indian security agencies said the government of pakistan is considering different options as to how to deal with dawood and company. for the past seven years the isi has used them for carrying out anti-india activities and in turn provided them shelter in karachi. but tuesday's terrorist attack in the u.s has radically changed the situation. pakistan cannot now claim that it is opposing terrorism and still continue to provide shelter to those who collaborated with the isi in bombing mumbai,'' a senior ips officer observed. but what are the options before islamabad? the police sources said pakistan could let dawood and his team leave the country and find a safe haven wherever; extradite them to india or eliminate them. in the current scenario, no country will now risk providing shelter to anybody accused of terrorism, which rules out the first possibility. if dawood and his men are extradited to india then new delhi will be able to obtain a mass of evidence of the isi's role in bombing mumbai and also get details of its other anti-india operations,'' security expert said. this focusses attention on the third option. pakistan may get rid of dawood, memon et al by stage managing an encounter or encouraging rival gangs in karachi to target the indian don by withdrawing security,'' the expert added. dawood and his friends have all along been guarded by isi personnel. with washington taking a tough stand, pakistan, indian security agencies say, will be now be required to take a series of steps to prove its anti-terrorist credentials. apart from stopping support for kashmiri terrorists, pakistan will also be required to tackle dawood and his team. president pervez musharraf has declared unstinted support to washington in its war against terrorism. u.s. president george w. bush has, however, indicated that he would prefer to see how gen musharraf translates his assurance into action rather than accept his promise at its face value.

12,RPL's marketing charge on trucks,"new delhi: reliance petroleum is thumbing a ride from truckers to spearhead its oil marketing thrust, months ahead of the government's april 2002 deadline for opening up the retailing business for private participation. the company is aggressively acquiring land along national highways across the country for setting up outlets that will only sell diesel and will be designed as one-stop shops for truckers. the company has acquired or taken operational control of 150 sites, each measuring about three acres, along major highways throughout the country in the first phase of its marketing plan. the company is aiming at setting up about 200 such outlets by march 2002. in the second phase, the company plans to take this number up to 2,000 in four to five years. it is trying to set up outlets on both sides of highways at every 200 km on the north-south and east-west axis. the first 200 outlets will be operational the moment oil marketing is opened for the private sector. the government is believed to have cleared reliance petroleum's application for setting up the outlets before the deadline for pricing deregulation. this is in line with the recommendations of a committee under additional secretary in the oil ministry, naresh narad, which had suggested allowing prospective private players time to prepare in advance. though a reliance petroleum spokesperson in mumbai declined to comment, industry sources said the company was moving to rope in major tyre manufacturers and transporters. the sources said a group of company officials had traversed the length and breadth of the country, logging about 100,000 km, travelling on trucks to study the requirements of the tarmac tigers. the result: an ambitious blueprint for one-stop shops offering total solutions to truckers and taking operational control of about 10 per cent of the 16 lakh trucks plying the country's roads. according to the blueprint, besides selling diesel, the outlets would offer tyre services and have food outlets, wash rooms and a complete logistics management system. to this end, the company is in talks with major tyre manufacturers, including jk tyres, apollo and mrf. all the three firms have already made presentations to reliance petroleum, which is also in talks with major engine manufacturers like tata engineering for franchise for operating maintenance service. the company is also talking to individual truckers and owners of fleets for operational control of the vehicles. details were, however, not available. rpl currently sells the four controlled products -- cooking gas, petrol, kerosene and diesel -- from its jamnagar refinery to the public sector oil companies to the extent required by them. the government's oil coordination committee determines the price realisation for the sale of these products, based on the principle of import parity. however, faced with surplus diesel, which it has had to export, the company has been asking the government for higher offtake of its products, which the government has turned down. the company's latest move will ensure a captive market for its key product. reliance petroleum already has a marketing tieup with indianoil and is one of the bidders for ibp. in case it comes out the winner, reliance petroleum will control the 1,500 outlets of the oil retailing psu, which has about 5 per cent market share.

13,Amrinder faces challenge for party ticket,"patiala: pradesh congress committee president captain amarinder singh may have to face challenge from within the party before going on to contest the assembly elections. when the congress party observer was in the city last monday to meet the aspirants for the party ticket for patiala city assembly constituency, no one had put claim for the seat and the field was left open for amarinder. but, after the party observer left, former punjab minister brahm mohindrastarted presenting himself as a strong aspirant for the party ticket. the congress workers,who came in groups to meet the party observer, conveyed that they all were in favour of amarinder. however, a group of some old congressmen met the observer separately and it is being presumed that they raised some serious issues about the congress candidature that might not be in favour of the party president. giving reason for his inability to meet the party observer, brahm said that he was out of station. but the political pundits feel that his absence was planned and he would create pressure through some national leaders for the party ticket. without any strong support, he could not take the risk of avoiding the party observer, they say. on the other hand, amarinder's brother raja malwindera singh has put his claim for the samana seat, but it is not a cakewalk for him. he appeared before the observer on monday, which was not scheduled for the ticket aspirants for the samana seat. former congress mla bir davinder singh also went to meet the observer just after the meeting of malwindera and staked his claim to the party ticket. two other senior congress leaders surinder singla and sant ram singla also put their claim for the samana party ticket. surinder singla is said to be close to 10 janpath and is also a member of the 11-member high-powered committee of the state unit of the party. no doubt, amarinder would make all efforts to get ticket for his brother, but how much he would be able to use his position and influence, remains to be seen. it is worthwhile to note that district congress president (urban) ved parkash gupta has not presented himself as an aspirant for any constituency. he has been reportedly assured of chairmanship of any board or corporation if the congress comes to power.

16,Specialists make family doctors extinct,"pune:the family doctor with his reassuring bedside manner, intimate knowledge of the family and willingness to make house calls whenever required, is becoming an extinct species in an age of specialists and superspecialists. this declining trend is worrying the estimated 5,000 general practitioners or family doctors in the city, and is likely to be the focus of the 10th conference of general practitioners scheduled in the city on september 22 and 23. nuclear families have developed a preference for specialists. the medical reimbursement packets offered by companies push people towards specialists, says dr suhas alekar, president of the general practitioners' association (gpa). for their part family doctors may have failed to keep pace with the latest developments. sometimes, the patients have more knowledge than the doctor thanks to the internet! dr alekar observes. constantly updating their knowledge will become essential for doctors because of another major change which is also likely to be discussed at the conference: the introduction of the relicencing system here like in the us. every doctor will have to apply for fresh registration to the medical council of india every five years, dr alekar explains. relicencing will depend on whether the doctor has completed the required number of cme (continuing medical education) hours and this is where our cme sessions and the certificates we issue to participants will come in handy. gpa general secretary, dr hillary rodrigues, believes that the family doctor is equally important today. we know the family's socio-economic conditions. we have known our patients since they were kids.we have a better understanding of their physical as well as mental strengths and weaknesses. this knowledge is very important at the time of diagnosis, he says. giving an example of how effective the family doctor can be, dr alekar says that the world health organisation (who) estimates that depression will be the number one killer in india by the year 2020. family doctors are better equipped to prevent these deaths because they are in the perfect position to notice the first symptoms of depression. an entire session in the forthcoming conference will be devoted to 'anxiety and depression', he added. another important factor that works in favour of the family doctor is the practice of home visits. many feel that it lowers the status of the doctor but in fact is an excellent opportunity to establish a bond between the patient and the doctor. only home visits can provide some of the vital information we need about the patient and most of the times it is not forthcoming from the patient himself, dr rodrigues observes. the conference will also deliberate on the danger of hiv/aids and the pre-natal determination test (pndt) which is currently misused for sex determination and selective abortions. the family doctor who acts as a friend, guide and philosopher can prevent misuse of pndt and help curb the spread of hiv/aids thanks to the bond he or she shares with patients and their families, dr alekar points out.

20,Police separates law and order duties from crime detection,"hyderabad: heralding a new beginning in the administration of indian police, the police network in the state is set to be divided into two separate heads: crime investigation and law and order. the government has revised the andhra pradesh police manual (appm), paving the way for establishment of separate police stations for crime investigation duties in the cities as well as in big towns. the new appm, which replaces the earlier manual of 1960 and the copies of which were under print, will come into effect shortly. it is for the first time in the country that a state is going for such an advanced system of policing, which exists in western countries. several additions have been incorporated in the new appm, clearly demarcating the duties between law & order and crime. former cbi director and currently r&b minister k vijayarama rao has authored the new manual. while revising the manual, it had come to the notice of the government that the station house officers (sho) in urban areas were burdened with routine law and order duties and not able to concentrate on crime detection and investigation. though the crime investigation department (cid) exists at the state level, it was found that the agency was concentrating only on detecting important cases. ""considering all the views, the government felt it necessary to separate crime investigation from law and order duties,"" a senior official involved in the preparation of the new manual said. on an experimental basis inspectors were posted to crime-prone areas. ""with the posting of an inspector for exclusive crime detection duties, the shos felt relieved and began concentrating on maintaining law and order in their respective police station limits,"" the senior official said.
