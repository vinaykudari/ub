0,GMCH faculty sore at anomalies in R&P rules,"CHANDIGARH:The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) faculty members are brimming with discontent.

With the threat of derecognition of GMCH by the Medical Council of India (MCI) looming large, the faculty is sore at the ""glaring anomalies"" in the existing recruitment and promotion (R&P) rules which might put the future of the college at stake when the MCI team carries out inspection in a few months from now. The matter has been brought to the notice of the UT Administration.

Dubbing the R&P rules as ""basically flawed"", the faculty members in their representation to adviser to the UT Administrator Virendra Singh have said that the rules are ""against MCI recommendations"".

Notes a senior faculty member, ""As per MCI, a person has to work as reader for four years before becoming eligible for the post of professor. But in our R&P rules this period has been reduced to two years which goes beyond the scope of MCI guidelines and would lead to multiple problems when MCI inspects GMCH.""

Further, the faculty members say that in its repeated inspections, the MCI had clearly intimated in writing that it does not approve deputation including short-term contract as valid mode of recuritment for recognition of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses.

""But the single most important point was ignored by making these rules and the same has been included as mode of recruitment of faculty posts in GMCH at all levels. If this is followed, the college will certainly be derecognised. Though the college authorities have woken up to the significance of MCI for the post of director-principal, for the remaining faculty posts, the recruitment process is in full swing as per existing rules without bothering about MCI directions,"" adds another senior faculty member.

Alleging ""clear discrimination"" for filling up posts of readers existing in different departments, a professor says, ""As per our R&P rules, posts of readers are being filled up by three different methods.""

In the departments of anaesthesia, biochemistry, microbiology, opthalmology, orthopaedics, paediatrics, pharmacology, psychiatry, radiology, TB and chest, dermatology, forensic medicine and ENT the method is promotion/deputation including short-term contract failing which direct recruitment process is adopted.

However, for the departments of anatomy, community medicine, haematology and blood transfusion, obstetrics and gynaecology, pathology and physiology the recruitment mode is promotion failing which by deputation, including short-term contract failing which direct recruitment route is adopted.

For the department of surgery, 50 per cent of senior lecturers would be promoted by DPC through UPSC while 50 per cent will have to go through direct recruitment process through UPSC and compete with applicants from all over the country.

3,"Halt decline of farm-sector, Manmohan urges state","MUMBAI: Maharashtraâ€™s rank in the nationâ€™s economic charts may slip if the state does not boost manufacturing and check the decline in agriculture and cooperatives, warned Manmohan Singh, former finance minister.

Releasing a collection of articles on Maharashtraâ€™s economy on Wednesday, Mr Singh said that there should be greater partnership between the public and private sector. He said that the country could not afford â€œjobless growthâ€™â€™.

The collection, published by the Ambedkar Institute of Economic and Social Change, has been edited by Bhalchandra Mungekar, Vice-Chancellor of Mumbai University.

The collection emphasises the need to alter the model of urbanisation and industrialisation adopted by Maharashtra because it has failed to addressed basic problems, such as poverty and regional developmental imbalance.

Maharashtra chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde,who presided over the function, said that Mumbai was emerging as the countryâ€™s services capital. He said that the state would quadruple its income by 2010. The interests of the poor would not be forgotten, he said.

4,"Attack on press can't be probed, says govt","NEW DELHI: Central government counsel Lala Ram Gupta told the Liberhan Commission on Friday that its terms of reference do not allow it to inquire into the alleged attack on mediapersons at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, the day the Babri Masjid was demolished.

Gupta also said that the report by the Justice Sarkaria committee, set up by the Press Council of India (PCI), is contrary to the law since the PCI Act puts a bar on it from probing a matter pending before a court or an inquiry commission.

The PCI report had said that the attack on mediapersons was pre-planned. But Gupta insisted that the Sarkaria report could not be considered as evidence before the commission as neither was a notice issued nor was an opportunity given to other parties to give their submissions.

Gupta, however, maintained that there was no bar on the media to report the events of December 6, 1992. He also did not agree when the commission asked him if the ban was imposed by any non-governmental organisation.

But he admitted that if kar sevaks had imposed any restriction, it was an unlawful act.

5,"Development, not security BJP poll plank","MUMBAI: BJP''s three-day ''chintan baithak'' brainstorm session here appears to have endorsed Prime Minister Vajpayee''s suggestion to contest the next Lok Sabha poll on the issue of development (''vikas'') and not national security.

How to gear the organisation for the coming round of five assembly and the next Lok Sabha polls by showcasing the BJP-led NDA coalition''s achievements, with a stress on programmes developed for the poor, was the central theme at the session, it is learnt.

The party plans to seek a mandate to re-elect the BJP to enable the party to complete the work.

Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s speech at the conclusion of the conclave indicated the leadership controversy had been put aside; he asked everyone to work under Vajpayee for a win in the next polls. And though he spoke on national security, Advani chose to stress the importance of the development issue.

The party also made clear its conviction of Hindutva being an integral part of the BJP ideology.

""We are of the opinion that a beautiful Ram temple must be constructed at Ayodhya. What modalities to adopt should be chosen by the government,"" party president Venkaiah Naidu said.

7,Wife's torture leads to suicide,"LUCKNOW: Moved by the alleged torture of his â€œpregnant wifeâ€� at the hands of police, a youth reportedly committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in the thickets dotting the Bandha road in Hazratganj police circle on Friday morning.

Despite a suicide note recovered from the person of the deceased, his parents alleged the incident was that of murder and accused the family members of his beloved for the crime. Reports said that body of a youth was found hanging from a tree behind the Bahukhandi Awas near Gomti Barrage.

Police reached the site and brought the body down. Clad in a shirt and trousers, the deceased was in his early 20s. Police recovered some letters and documents from the person of the deceased which included some letters addressed to his beloved. From the documents recovered, the deceased was identified as Anil Jaiswal, son of Ram Swaroop of Ghaus Purwa locality in A block area of Indira Nagar.

A suicide note was also recovered from his person in which he said that he could not bear the pain which Preeti (not the real name) had to undergo at the hands of the police. He requested his â€œmummyâ€� and â€œpapaâ€� in the note, to take care of his child who was yet to be born. Later, Anilâ€™s father Ram Swaroop, a vendor, told Times News Network that since the last two years, Anil was in love with Preeti Pandey, daughter of a UPSRTC employee residing in Indira Nagar.

â€œAbout six months ago Anil married Preeti and, thereafter, she was staying with him at our house as husband and wife,â€� Ram Swaroop said. As he was badly shaken by the death of his son, he could not elaborate on how the two got married, in court or at any Arya Samaj mandir.

Weeping inconsolably, Anilâ€™s mother Geeta said: â€œAbout a fortnight ago one assistant sub-inspector RB Singh from Ghazipur police station arrived at our house and dragged away Preeti when neither Anil nor his father was at home.â€� According to the parents of Anil, Preeti was taken to the Mahila Thana in Hazratganj where she was detained illegally for more than 10 days.

There Preeti was allegedly subjected to severe physical torture and forced to give a statement that she was kidnapped by Anil and held captive all this while. When she refused to relent, Preeti was finally produced in court where she reportedly told the magistrate that she was married to Anil and wanted to live with him only. However, in the documents submitted to the court, Preeti was stated to be a minor and, hence, her statement were not held legally valid.

The police, in their records, stated that Preeti was rescued from the house on Anil on a complaint lodged by her father. Anil was charged with kidnapping a minor girl and keeping her in illegal confinement. This left Anil devastated and he could not bear the forced separation from his wife who was by now four-month pregnant. However, parents of Anil claimed that a maxi-cab driver, Anil was approached by two persons on Thursday around 9 am.

The visitors took Anil away on the pretext that they had come from Preetiâ€™s house and wanted to take him to her. They reportedly stated that Preeti wanted to talk to him. Anil was missing since and his body was found on Friday morning. They alleged that Preetiâ€™s family members were behind the murder of their son. The body of Anil was sent for post-mortem examination.

8,Workshop to promote watershed development,"HAZARIBAG: Speaking as chief guest on the concluding day of the workshop on National Watershed Development Project of the ministry of agriculture organised by the Holy Cross Social Services Centre, Hazaribag, Jayram, director of soil conservation said that the workshop was organised with a view to educate the farmers and involve them collectively for the development of watershed projects in Jharkhand which will play a significant role in preservation of rainwater in the small rivers and rivulets for irrigation purpose.

The workshop was organised under the auspices of the Directorate of Soil Conservation, for the Self Help Groups (SHGs).

Watershed projects in Jharkhand were initially taken up as 19 pilot project last year on an experimental basis. This year the government has decided to take up 200 watershed projects in the entire state for the benefit of farmers.

Self Help Groups (SHG) have been selected for this type of training as they can take up the projects collectively and on successful completion will be able to change the economy of the village, which is the need of the hour.

He also said that after training when SHG members return to their respective village, they will form â€œJal Chajan Samitiâ€� (Watershed Samiti) in co-operation with the nodal agencies mainly soil conservation department who were asked to implement the watershed development programme.

The director also said that he was very impressed to find village women from 56 self help groups from six districts of Jharkhand viz Palamau, Latehar, Ranchi, Hazaribag, Gumla and Garhwa participate in the workshop and took keen interest in the concept of the watershed development.

9,Centre's deposition incorrect: Katiyar,"LUCKNOW: Launching a damage-control exercise following RKP president Kalyan Singhâ€™s threat to expose LK Advani and others, BJP state president Vinay Katiyar said that deposition of the Centreâ€™s counsel Lala Ram Gupta before the Liberhan Commission was â€˜incorrectâ€™.

Talking to mediapersons at the party headquarters, Katiyar also disputed Kalyanâ€™s startling revelation that Advani, Dr Murl Manohar Joshi, top RSS and VHP leaders had conspired and instigated kar sevaks to pull down the Babri mosque on december 6 1992. â€œNo one should be blamed for the demolition of Babri mosque.

It was a momentary and spontanteous reaction of people who even ignored appeals made by senior leaders like Lk Advani and others,â€� clarified Katiyar after realising the sensitive nature and far-reaching consequences of Kalyanâ€™s utterances directed against top BJP, RSS and VHP leaders.

Katiyar said that in such a situation like the one on December 6 1992, an individual, leaders or groups canâ€™t be held responisble. â€œHow can a person or persons be held responsible for momentarily mob act?â€� he questioned, disagreeing with LR Guptaâ€™s depsoition on behalf of the Centre before the Libarahan Commission. He did not spare Kalyan either. â€œKalyan Singh is like my elder brother but he should not change his stand on Ram Janambhhomi with the change of party.

A leader of his stature should not indulge in cheap publicity and vote bank politics,â€� he said. Questioning the role played by the then Rao government, Katiyar disclosed that Rao had confided to one senior bureaucrat at that time that â€œhe was avenging the insult and humiliation to his family.â€� Will Rao elaborate on this and why was he a mute spectator to the whole thing? questioned Katiyar. Taking a dig at Arjun Singh too, the BJP state president said that Singh had stated on December 4 in Lucknow that some Kashmiri militants had sneaked into Faizabad and Ayodhya.

â€œWill Arjun Singh now disclose the source of his information?â€� fired Katiyar. â€œDemolition of Babri mosque on December 6 1992 was due to the internal politics of the Congress at that time,â€� he claimed. The former Bajrang Dal president, who is also an accused in the Babri demolition conspiracy case, also took umbrage to CBI filing supplementary chargesheet against the deputy prime minister LK Advani and seven others.

â€œThere are no complainants. Neither the pujari nor any other person had lodged any FIR against Advani and others. Then on what basis the CBI has filed the supplementary chargesheet? pointed Katiyar. On his yatra, he said that it was a huge success as he managed cut across the five year versus 50 years of BJP and Congress rule and roped in support of the people for scrapping Article 370 and legislation to control population.

10,New traffic rules fail to yield results,"RANCHI: Despite several attempts made by the district administration to solve the problem of traffic jams in Ranchi, it appears to be a difficult proposition. The administration has introduced a new traffic system a couple of days ago in the city. In the new system, taking U-turns on the main road, excluding two cross overs, has been strictly forbidden.

Saroj Kumar, a senior citizen and resident of the PP Compound, said the introduction of new traffic system is not going to check the traffic menace.

The problem arises because of the increasing number of three-wheelers and vikrams, which are not only a constant source of pollution but also cause road accidents because of rash driving.

Sharing similar views, Prashant Kumar, a college student, said, whenever district administration finds it difficult to control traffic it introduces a new system but it often boomerangs.Even after the imposition of new traffic system, streets, excluding the Main Road, remain jam-packed throughout the day.

The new traffic system has put additional burden on the Station Road which is in a dilapidated condition. When contacted, Ranchi DC Pradeep Kumar explained that the new traffic system has been introduced on an experimental basis for a week and would continue only after it yields positive results.

The district administration felt the traffic chaos was the result of lack of awareness about traffic norms. For this, the district administration has decided to distribute pamphlets and display hoardings, carrying messages to follow traffic rules in various parts of the state capital.

13,YSR for tie-up with Left parties for polls,"HYDERABAD: The Congress on Friday offered to work with the Left-wing parties in the next Assembly elections, but refused to have any prepoll arrangements with the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS).

Sounding optimistic about an electoral understanding with the CPM and CPI in the next elections, Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy said at a Meet-the-Press at the Press Club here: â€œWe can definitely work together.We will extend a hand of friendship. It is for them to reciprocate.â€�

However, he said he saw no reason to have any alliance with the TRS. â€œThe Congress is very strong in Telangana.

We will only strengthen our base wherever the leadership is weak,â€� he said.

To a question on the migration of Telangana Congress leaders to the TRS, Reddy said these leaders were defecting as they realised that they would not get a Congress ticket in the next elections.

Answering a question, he said there was an urgent need to provide a comprehensive package of welfare measures for senior citizens.

The pension of Rs 75 being given by the state now is meagre, he said.

Meanwhile, the CPM and the CPI were guarded in their reaction to Y S Rajasekhara Reddyâ€™s call for an alliance.

While the CPM said it was not yet time to discuss election-related issues, the CPI left the matter to its national executive committee.

CPM state secretary B V Raghavulu told reporters in Khammam that his party was not looking for any poll tie-ups with any party at the moment. â€œInstead of talking about alliances, we should concentrate on peopleâ€™s issues,â€� he said.

In Hyderabad, CPI secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said APCC president M Satyanarayana Rao had already approached them on the alliance issue and the matter was being considered by the CPI national executive.

â€œWe tried to avoid crossing swords with each other during the panchayat and municipal elections in some areas. However, it is too early to take a decision. Our only aim is to defeat the TDP and BJP, so there may be some areas where we may have a common agenda with the Congress,â€� he said.

Raghavulu said on Thursday that his party would help the Congress get mileage wherever possible in their fight against the BJP and also the NDA alliance partners.

â€œOur top priority is to defeat communal forces,â€� he said.

14,UP govt halts construction work near Taj,"LUCKNOW: Construction work at the Taj heritage corridor has been stopped under the directives issued by the state government much before the Union Minister for Tourism and Culture Jagmohan came in the picture, claimed the chief minister Mayawati on Saturday.

In reply to a query, Mayawati said that she had herself issued the necessary orders ""long as soon as the controversy cropped up"" and Jagmohan''s instructions in this regard came only on Friday.

15,Mayawati's rally will be held on schedule: Karimpuri,"JALANDHAR: Punjab Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Avtar Singh Karimpuri on Saturday asserted no change in the proposed anti-government rally at Buta Mandi here on July 7 to be addressed by party vice-president and UP chief minister Mayawati.

Taking exception to the reported statement of chief minister Amarinder Singh about suggesting his UP counterpart not to go ahead with the rally in view of sensitive situation following Talhan clashes, Karimpuri said the statement was politically motivated.

Since the government and the district administration have been claiming that the situation has become normal, then what guided the CM to suggest not to hold the rally, he said.

Was the situation not sensitive when the government allowed its Central leaders along with number of state and local Congress leaders to enter the village despite the curfew, he questioned.

State BSP general secretary Pawan Kumar Tinu held that the government was trying to conceal its failure to resolve the issue through such tactics.

The rally aimed at exposing anti-Dalit face of the government which did nothing for them during its tenure so far, said the leaders.

Reportedly, the district police chief Harpreet Singh Sidhu has already granted permission for the rally but confusion persists as the deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Gupta has sought report from him about this which is awaited. The final decision, however, would be taken as per the government instructions, said sources.

There has been no word from the government as yet, they added.

16,"PROA to collect property details of minister, ex-bureaucrat","BATHINDA: A meeting of Punjab Revenue Officers Association (PROA), on Saturday, decided to collect the details of properties of a state minister and a former financial commissioner (revenue) who have allegedly purchased a number of properties in Jalandhar and Ropar districts by indulging in corrupt means.

The revenue officers also resolved to expose files of some controversial cases in which the senior officers in the revenue department charged huge money from litigants for giving a favourable verdict.

The decision to this effect was taken by the association members after their delegation failed to meet financial commissioner (revenue), Punjab, on Saturday.

The revenue officers had fixed an appointment with the financial commissioner (revenue) on Saturday for a meeting.

The association members wanted to express their anguish over the way the vigilance department officials were harassing the revenue officials on minor grounds. But, as the financial commissioner was reported to be on an official tour on Saturday and could not meet the delegation, the officers alleged that he avoided them intentionally.

Amarpal Singh Tiwana, the president of the association, said that in protest against the insensitive attitude of the financial commissioner, the executive body of the association had decided not to meet him.

He told that a delegation of the association would now meet the new financial commissioner after the retirement of the present incumbent which is due next week.

The executive body members of the association said that the association had decided to intensify their stir against the state government if their grievances against the vigilance department were not addressed. The patwaris and kanungos would also join the agitation, said Tiwana.

The revenue officers are on the path of agitation for the last about one month in protest against the arrest of Sardulgarh tehsildar by the vigilance department under the charges of corruption. On June 18, the revenue officers had went on a mass casual leave over the state.

Jai Chand Parinda, a member of executive body, said that the vigilancedepartment had conducted raids at the offices of 14 revenue officers in June-July last year but never any recovery was made.

Even then, some fake cases were slapped on the officers, alleged Parinda. He said that the Punjab chief minister had assured in July last year to withdraw all these cases but no action was taken in this regard so far.

17,"Ineligible teacher completes 30 years of govt service, retires","KOTKAPURA: It is a classic case of things moving at snail''s pace in education department. A woman, who was ineligible for the post of home science mistress joined service in education department at Kotkapura way back in 1972, completed her service and got superannuation last year with all post-service benefits.

Interestingly, now the department authorities have woken up from deep slumber to seek action against her. The circle education officer (CEO), Faridkot has written to the director, education department (secondary) Punjab for recovering all the pecuniary benefits received by Suprbha Gupta, the teacher, during her 30 years of service.

It is not that the matter was not in the notice of the department during these years. Immediately after Suprbha joined as a teacher in 1972, the education department had received a complaint against her from one Ram Chand, a local resident, challenging her appointment.

Though Ram Chand kept pursuing the matter with the higher authorities during the last three decades but the political influence of the teacher''s husband allegedly helped her in saving the job.

Even in 1994, Nabha circle education officer Manjeet Singh Chahal had indicted the teacher for securing the job without eligibility and recommended her dismissal from service but the things remained unchanged.

Now when it is too late, another inquiry by CEO Faridkot Jaskartar Singh has again established Suprbha''s appointment as illegal and sought action as well as return of all amount she withdrew as salary and other benefits during her service period.

In his inquiry report, the CEO revealed that though the complaint of Ram Chand was of self-explanatory nature and the action against the teacher should have been taken long back but it was her husband''s influence that the complaint kept gathering dust for years.

Hargobind Rai, husband of Suprbha, who also retired as a government teacher and runs a finance company here, denied the allegations of her wife being an ineligible candidate for the post.

He alleged that the inquiry report was an outcome of his personal rivalry with some education department officials who were trying to tarnish his image.
