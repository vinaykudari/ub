1,Housing society women protest 'harassment',"PUNE: A group of women from the Vasant Bahar co-operative housing society in Gokhalenagar has threatened to stage a hunger strike at the Janwadi police chowky on Sunday.

The women, most of whom are educated and hail from the middle class, have alleged that they are being harassed by a society member Vishwas Chavan, who is also a local Shiv Sena leader, and the local police.

Chavan and the Janwadi police have, however, strongly refuted the charges.

""Acting on the complaints filed by these women, we had arrested Chavan on November 18, but as the offence was bailable, he was released by the court,"" senior police inspector of the Chatushrungi police station Vishnu Mane said.

Led by local Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator Nitin Jagtap, 15 women from the Vasant Bahar society addressed a joint press conference here on Thursday.

The women submitted a memorandum, with their names and addresses to reporters, but have pleaded anonymity fearing ""victimisation"" by the police.

The women claimed that Chavan often abuses them besides threatening them with physical harassment. They have lodged several complaints against him with the police, but, the police have not initiated any action against him, they said.

As per the police complaint, lodged on November 18, Chavan had abused a housewife from the society and had even threatened her with dire consequences.

""Ironically, instead of taking action against Chavan, the police have found an easy way out and lodged chapter cases against us. We are frequently called to the police chowky late at night. We are tired of the harassment by the police and Chavan and hence, we have come to the press,"" the women said.

Mane, however, denied registering any case against the women. ""We have not registered chapter cases against the women, nor have they been called to the police chowky late at night,"" he said.

Nitin Jagtap, who was present at the press conference, alleged that Chavan had assaulted him on November 18.

When contacted, Chavan refuted the allegations and termed the complaints against him as a political stunt. He showed this reporter the copies of the complaint made by him against alleged illegal construction by Jagtap and some society members.

""It is because I have complained against their illegal constructions, they want to tarnish my image,"" Chavan said, asserting that he had never abused any woman.

2,Concern over 'essential' painkiller increases,"LUCKNOW: While the controversy over the use of Nimesulides rages on, the drug is assured of a long and prosperous future in Uttar Pradesh. A list of â€˜essential drugsâ€™ compiled by the government health department, it is reliably learnt, includes Nimesulides both in the tablet and syrup as one of the â€˜essential drugsâ€™ for centralised procurement to be used by government hospitals .

The exercise to shortlist the essential drugs was undertaken by the UP Health System Development Project (UPHSDP) a year ago, on the suggestion of Delhi Society for Promotion of Rational Use of Drugs (DSPRUD). Based on â€˜standard treatment guidelinesâ€™ recommended by a panel of medical experts in UP, the department had finally selected a total number of 160 drugs. This list is pending with the government for approval since July, claim informed sources in the health department.

The concept of essential drugs was first stressed in 1972, in the WHOâ€™s action programme for attaining health for all by 2000 AD. The Hathi Commission had recognised 113 drugs as essential and the government of India has included 279 drugs in the genre.

Inclusion of Nimesulides in the state list has predictably stirred a hornets nest and the medical fraternity is clearly divided over the issue. One section defends the drug tooth and nail, holding it as a very effective painkiller with very few side effects.

Making light of the non approval by the Federal Drug Agency, a faculty member in the SGPGI said the agency had extremely rigid standards and a set protocol and sometimes went to ridiculous lengths to maintain it.

However, the conservative section is gravely concerned over the indiscriminate and growing use of Nimesulides. Criticising the government for allowing the state to become a dumping ground for western discard, an expert attributed the inclusion to aggressive public relations by pharma companies, their only draw being profit-making, complained a senior professor in the medical university.

This trend has led to a rich manâ€™s drugs phenomenon, he said, which meant manufacturing fancy antibiotics and painkillers to the exclusion of life saving drugs like ORS, anti-tubercular drugs, or vaccine to counter Japanese encephalitis. Even for something as essential as vitamin A, one has to depend solely on government supply, he pointed out.

Nimesulides, cautioned another clinician, may lead to arrhythmias along with liver toxicity and GI related problems. Yet the drug has completely wiped away its competitors Paracetamol and Ibuprofen group, he added. Claims Nishit Rastogi from Lata Pharma, one of the biggest retailers, â€œNegative publicity apart, the drug enjoys one of the best over-the-counter saleâ€�. Zonal manager of Panacea, a pioneer in the launch of the drug, dismisses the controversy as â€œbaseless canards circulated by business competitors.â€�

4,Dubey remark against govt triggers row,"RANCHI: The first chief secretary of the Jharkhand government, V S Dubey, who retired from the IAS a couple of months ago, has bounced back as a topic of hot discussion due to his frank and no-holds-barred interview.

In the interview given to a local Hindi daily, he criticised the government in which he was the number one bureaucrat. Incidentally, the interview was published the day the state government launched the second foundation day celebrations.

Senior politicians and bureaucrats reacted, saying that it was in bad taste. Some bureaucrats said maybe Dubeyji was very frustrated during his tenure as the chief secretary of the state.

A senior politician from the ruling BJP commented, ""If the chief secretary is not the government, then who is? Dubeyji''s interview was not only in bad taste but it also violated the established norms.

How can a man who was also responsible for implementing the decisions taken by the state government make such statements after retirement?"" he asked, adding, ""If the state government wants, it can still initiate action against Dubeyji even though he has retired from the government service.""

In the interview, Dubey said the state government tried to enforce 73 per cent reservation, knowing well that more than 50 per cent reservation is unconstitutional.

This was done for political advantage and to please his supporters. But it divided the society, he maintained.

Dubey also criticised the state government for ""Talibanisation of education"" in Jharkhand through the appointment of teachers at the primary level.

On the energy front too he criticised the state government, saying that it claims to take electricity to 20,000 villages for which six grid stations and 212 power stations were to be set up.

For this the Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) was given Rs 250 crore in 2001-02 and another Rs 250 crore in 2002-03. But the JSEB could utilise only Rs 50 crore in the first year and the balance amount has been kept in bank.

So, nothing substantial was done, and the power supply even in the state capital deteriorated. On the law and order front too the state government failed miserably, and extremist activities could not be curbed.

Continued extremist activities have deterred investors from coming to Jharkhand, Dubey opined. Referring to the state government''s dealing with extremists, he described its rehabilitation scheme as a lollipop.

In this controversy-generating interview, Dubey also asked why only a small portion of the fund allocated for the construction of roads was used.

In the first year, only Rs 90 crore out of Rs 300 crore was used while in the second year, only Rs 30 to 40 crore out of the allocated Rs 300 crore could be spent, he observed.

In short, while Dubey was a very important part of the state government nothing much was being done, and he could only be a helpless onlooker, commented a bureaucrat.

5,Minister rejects Mohane farmers' plea,"PATNA: Water resources minister Jagadanand Singh has ruled out giving unlimited water to the farmers of Mohane in Gaya district where a Satyagraha has been launched by the local farmers.

""Agreeing to the farmers'' demand would virtually mean dismantling one of the best irrigation systems of central Bihar which irrigates 30,000 hectares of agricultural land,"" the minister said while speaking to mediapersons on Friday.

He said technical decisions cannot be changed due to agitations.

""It would amount to reversing the process of water management"", he said.

The minister said the farmers of Mohane are demanding the opening of the canal and access to unlimited water.

""If we opened the mouth of the Udersthan irrigation system in Mohane, the water level of the pond will go down and the whole system will become defunct,"" he said.

Remarking on the dharna staged by leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi in Mohane, the minister said Modi is unaware of the technical difficulties.

""I would write to Modi, informing him about the technical difficulties in opening the canal,"" he said.

The minister said the controversy may have arisen due to political reasons.

""There has been no agitation on this issue by the farmers for the last 35 years. How it is being raised this year?"" he asked, adding a delegation of Mohane farmers had met him and he had explained to them about the technical difficulties.

""We can provide them water through a different canal,"" he said, stressing if the mouth of the irrigation system was opened in Mohane, it would lead to widespread agitation by farmers in other parts of central Bihar. He promised to supply 325 cusecs of water through a different canal system.

However, leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi, who broke his fast in Mohane on Friday morning, said the minister has been misguided by his advisors.

""Out of the seven schemes in the Udersthan irrigation system, four are not concerned with either Faguni or Mohane rivers,"" Modi said. He said a barrage should be constructed at the Udersthan project to control excess flow of water.

Modi said water can not be supplied through any other canal system there as there had been no water in the other canals for the last 15 years. He stressed that a technical committee in 1992 had advocated the opening of the mouth of the system in Mohane.

He added a committee, under the supervision of Patna High Court, had said only 5000 acres of land were being irrigated through the whole project.

He alleged that the minister had assured the farmers of Mohane that the technical committee would give him a report after holding consultations with them.

""But the technical committee did not meet the farmers,"" he said.

He said the BJPs would raise the issue of non-functional irrigation systems in Bihar in the winter session of the state assembly.

6,Rural development ministry to launch 'Swajaldhara',"NEW DELHI: It will be the Union ministry of rural development''s way of marking Prime Minister Vajpayee''s 77th birthday which comes up on December 25. On that day, the ministry will have the PM launch the Swajaldhara programme which is basically aimed at improving drinking water availability in the country''s rural areas.

Swajaldhara will basically be an expansion of the ministry''s on-going sector reform programme which was undertaken initially as a pilot project in 67 districts of the country with the states bearing 50 per cent of the cost.

The project assumes significance in the light of the fact that there are over two lakh rural habitations in the country that do not have drinking water of a suitable quality while some 15,000 do not have any drinking water supply while some 1,27,000 habitations are partially covered.

In the extended programme, however, the Centre will bear 90 per cent of the cost Union minister of rural development minister Shanta Kumar told reporters here Friday. The remaining 10 per cent will have to come from the panchayats, he added. the gram panchayats will have full ownership of the assets, he added.

With a demand-driven and community participation approach with the panchayats playing a pivotal role, the project will aim at having people''s participation, said Kumar. Conceding that the task ahead will not be easy, Kumar hoped states would extend their cooperation for the programme.

7,Poor response to VHP bandh in city,"HYDERABAD: The bandh called by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to protest Thursday''s blast near Shirdi Sai Baba temple at Dilsukhnagar evoked poor response.

The bandh, supported by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, had little impact in the city with schools, offices, shops and business establishments functioning unhindered and buses plying normally.

Seven VHP activists were nabbed by Chatrinaka police when they tried to deflate tyres of buses in the area. The police chased away other workers, who attempted the similar trick and tried to force closure of shops at Amberpet and Sultan Bazar.

Though some shops were closed in Koti, Abids, Nallakunta, Vidyanagar, where the VHP and ABVP exert some influence, they too were reopened as the day passed by.

Even as people''s response to the bandh call was poor, the police took extra precautions in maintaining public order in the city. In addition to the 8,000-strong city police, hundreds of Rapid Action Force personnel were deployed in sensitive areas.

Following the blast, the police stepped up vigil at places of worship, while armed policemen were seen guarding important temples, and mosques in the city. A number of police teams were deployed near Charminar in the afternoon when prayers were offered at nearby Mecca Masjid. A thorough checking of vehicles and rounding up of people with suspicious characters has also being organised. Security at airport and railway stations, and bus stands was too tightened. Additional DGP (CID) Mahendra Kumawat, holding charge of city police commissioner, instructed the officers to take the help of peace and Mythri committees in infusing confidence among the public.

9,Campaign for urban bank election creates tension,"RAJAHMUNDRY: Mild tension prevailed at the Nandam Gani Raju junction when Congress and TDP supporters started erecting banners of their respective candidates for the Aryapuram Co-operative Urban Bank elections.

The co-operative bank with about Rs 130 crore turnover has become a prestigious issue between the Congress and TDP. Both parties have fielded their panel of candidates in the elections. Former bank chairman N Sitaramaraju has filed his nomination seeking chairmanship once again with the support of the Congress party. The TDP, BJP and CPI have fielded the proprietor of a cinema theatre, P Lakshmana Swamy, and a panel of directors, dominanted by advocates. Banners, hoardings and advertisements in local cable networks and hundreds of cars are involved in the campaigning even on the outskirts of the city and rural mandal of Rajahmundry. The situation appears to be tense as the campaign ended on Friday.

There were about 16,000 voters who were supposed to cast their votes and there were more than 45 candidates in the fray. According to district co-operative registrar Praveena, 32 polling stations would be arranged at the S K V T English Medium School near Nandam Gani Raju Junction. The leaders and their supporters wanted to erect cut-outs and banners near the polling station and this led to the tension.

12,No change in Pak terrorism policy: Fernandes,"KUPUP, Sikkim: Defence Minister George Fernandes on Saturday said the installation of a new prime minister in Pakistan would effect no change in the country''s policy on cross-border terrorism.

""Pakistan has a military dictatorship and who the prime minister is there will not make any difference,"" Fernandes told reporters here when asked if he could foresee any change in the neighbouring country''s policy on cross-border terrorism.

Earlier, the defence minister visited the Nathu La (Pass) and some of the forward posts of the Indian Army along the Indo-China border in Sikkim, located at a height of over 14,000 feet and 55 km from the state capital, Gangtok.

Of the 26 MLAs belonging to the faction, 23 had signed the memorandum, party sources said.Earlier in the day, the members met Karunakaran at his residence for discussions on the issue, which had, of late been a matter of contention in the party. The 'I' faction MLAs had earlier decided to meet Antony as a group, a move which was abandoned following the chief minister's reported stand that he would not meet MLAs on the basis of factions. Later, talking to reporters, Karunakaran lashed out at the UDF government's Police policy and said there was ""much more than meets the eye"" on the issue.

14,Traders ask govt to protect Aralam farm land,"KANNUR: Assailing the Kerala government''s move to rehabilitate landless tribals in the Central government owned Aralam farm in the district, trade union leaders on Saturday asked the state to protect the farm in the interests of workers and to save the agriculture sector.

The leaders, under the banner of Aralam farm protection committee, termed as ""highly irresponsible,"" SC/ST Welfare Minister, M A Kuttappan''s statement that the government would soon inform the Centre of its readiness to buy the farm for rehabilitation.

""By identifying the fertile 7500 acre Aralam farmland for rehabilitating tribals, the government is doing injustice, not only to nearly 4000 people who depend solely on the farm for their livelihood, but also working against the agriculture sector"", INTUC district president K Surendran told reporters here.

Stating that they were not against the rehabilitation of the tribals, committee convenor, Balakrishna Pillai said the government could assign 5,000 acres of forest land adjacent to the farm for the purpose.

He alleged that the attempts by Adivasi leader C K Janu to vest the Aralam farm for the tribals was in tune with the ''conspiracy'' hatched by some vested interests to get the land.

The leaders also asked the government to fulfil the assurances given to the committee for rehabilitating the 114 odd Adivasi families settled iniside the Aralam farm land.

The committee has decided to hold a five-day padayatra from Nov 26 to make the public aware about the issue.

15,BJP cadres in Panchmahals protest against nominee,"VADODARA: The decision by the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) to make Bajrang Dal national vice-president Harish Bhatt its candidate for the Godhra assembly seat has evoked sharp reactions in the Panchmahals district.

Several office-bearers of the party''s district and taluka units have threatened to resign from the party.

According to sources in the Panchmahals district BJP, the spate of demonstrations and irate representations that was seen in Godhra during the past one week, might be seen once again. Already, sources said, several office-bearers have offered to resign as a mark of protest against the decision.

Majority of the BJP''s cadre in the district want senior leader Gopalsinh Solanki as the candidate from Godhra. However, the state and central leadership of the party decided to give the ticket to Bhatt. While the decision had been made quite some time back, it was announced only on Saturday evening.

Reacting to the decision, Solanki said, ""It is true that people are offering to resign en masse. However, as a disciplined party member, I am trying to convince them against this move."" Solanki added that he was himself hurt due to the decision, but would accept it.

Party insiders, meanwhile, ruled out any chances of Solanki contesting the polls on his own. ""There are no indications in this regard despite the fact that several party members from the district are asking him to do so. The situation has become tricky for us not only in Godhra town, but the entire district on the whole,"" said a senior party functionary.

Local unit president of the party, Vasudev Mahendru, meanwhile, said that the senior leadership may have had its own calculations while taking the decision. ""It is true that there is large scale resentment against the decision. We will try to convince the party workers. What else can we do?"" Mahendru said.

16,Anti-incumbency may affect BJP prospects in Saurashtra,"RAJKOT: With a banner of revolt raised in the BJP over almost all seats in Saurashtra, the party has started the battle of the ballot with its back to the wall. Coupled with the large-scale dissident activities and the anti-incumbency wave, the party is in for a difficult time.

The Keshubhai factor may also play a vital role in the poll prospects of BJP candidates.

Dissidents have come out in the open in Padhadhari, Tankara, Jamjodhpur, Jamnagar, Palitana, Dhoraji, Manavadar, Wankaner and Savarkundla, besides Rajkot. Farmers and local small-scale industrial unit owners too are disenchanted owing to water and power crisis.

With no water, electricity, failure to declare drought in most parts of Saurashtra, rising prices of farm inputs, farmers find themselves in a spot. The state government has also failed to distribute crop insurance which has also added to the misery of agriculturists.

On the industrial front, the ongoing recession has affected the small-scale sector badly.

People here have been asking for local leaders to represent them, as they fear that an outsider would turn his face once poll results were out. Says Ramji Keshwala, a farmer from Manavadar, ""This year, the cotton crop has failed and we had made our representation to the local BJP leader who has pleaded helplessness. As a result, cotton growers have landed in huge debts. If the local BJP leader has adopted such a stand, imagine what would an outsider do if he was elected from our area.""

Similar arguments have been put forward by a cross-section of people soon after the names of candidates were declared.

Most small-scale industry owners have been hit hard by recession, and coupled with power shortage, they are finding it hard to face competition. Businessmen are largely annoyed with the state government''s industrial policy.

Another factor which may mar BJP candidates'' chances is the large-scale corruption in the 60:40 scheme of check-dam construction. Though crores of rupees were sanctioned for check-dams, many were washed away in the rains and many developed breaches.

BJP general secretary Lalji Savalia, who is contesting from Dhoraji against Vithal Radadiay of the Congress, has a difficult task ahead due to his allegedly corrupt methods in check-dam projects. A similar situation prevails in Savarkundla where local BJP leaders D K Patel and taluka BJP president V V Vaghasia have, in an open letter to the BJP leadership, sought a change of the sitting legislator Kalu Virani.

In nearby Wankaner too, the BJP leadership ignored the candidature of Rasik Anadkat, who led the recent farmers agitation against the lifting of water from the Wankaner bore project and its supply to Rajkot.

With dissidents far outnumbering loyal BJP workers, the officials candidates were jittery and were making frantic calls to the BJP high command to salvage the situation.

17,Police yet to make arrests in Colaba murder,"MUMBAI: The police havenâ€™t yet made any arrests in connection with the murder of 71-year-old Usha Sukhtankar, who was found dead in her second-floor flat in Arthur house, Colaba, on Friday morning.

Three peopleâ€”two domestic workers employed in the flat and a watchmanâ€”have been questioned about the incident. The police said that Satyavati, one of the servants, was fast asleep when the murder took place during the wee hours of Friday. She told the police that she hadnâ€™t woken up when the killer entered the flat and committed the murder.

The second servant was not in the flat when the murder took place. The watchman said he did not see anybody enter or leave the building during the night.

The building is being repaired, and police officials said that the killer may have climbed the scaffolding to enter the flat.

The murderer is believed to have entered through a window and escaped the same way.

Police officials said that their men had approached Ms Sukhtankar some months ago and asked her to register details about her servants in the database of senior citizens maintained by Mumbai police.

But a crime branch officer said that she had refused. Ms Sukhtankar seems to have been choked to death with a pillow, the police said.

Ms Sukhtankar, who was described by her watchman as ""very fit and agile"", was last seen on Thursday evening. She had returned home after delivering a lecture at the Council of Fair Business Practices, an organisation of which she was an executive member.

Ms Sukhtankar, the sisterin-law of industrialist Keshub Mahindra, was the 16th senior citizen who has been murdered in Mumbai this year. Most of the cases have gone unsolved.

18,Probe ordered into IMA polls,"MUMBAI: President-elect of the Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Maharashtra Dr Dilip Guha has ordered an inquiry into allegations of bogus voting during the IMA''s annual conference at Sangli last week.

There are allegations that at least two of the voters were not even members of the IMA, but were drivers. The conference was held to elect office-bearers of the IMA''s state chapter.

The organisers were tipped off that some of the voters were not genuine and subsequent investigations revealed that two men,who were registered as doctors from the IMA''s Mumbai suburban-west branch, were bogus. They were detained by the organisers and interrogated for nearly three hours, during which they admitted that they were not really doctors but had come to vote for Dr Vasant Shenoy. Shenoy is the general secretary of the Mumbai suburban west branch, which has the largest membership in Maharashtra.

Shenoy said he had nothing to do with the two men.

Guha,who is based in Nagpur, told TNN that the two controversial members had paid Rs 500 each towards registration for attending the conference. ""How could all this have happened?"" he wondered. Guha said Shenoy may have been made a scapegoat since there is intense rivalry between the various IMA branches. Since the Mumbai suburban (west) branch has the largest number of members, it is possible that a rival faction may have wanted to portray it in a poor light.

After the bogus voting came to light, Guha also received complaints that the Pune list contained the names of three persons who were not doctors. Sources said many aspired to become IMA office-bearers because of the money associated with the pharmaceutical firms that sponsor events.

19,"Bar council re-poll ruled out, polling peaceful in Punjab","CHANDIGARH: Bar council secretary-cum-returning officer Nirmal Singh Dhillon, on Saturday categorically ruled out a re-election either in Chandigarh or any part of Punjab and Haryana.

Dhillon asserted that the election had been conducted in a transparent manner and there was absolutely no justification for a re-poll. A section of lawyers contesting the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana elections had complained of bogus voting in the first phase of polling at the high court on Friday.

They had alleged the election had been stage-managed by the incumbent bar council management. Dhillon said, â€œThere was a lot of uproar over the alleged bogus voting at the high court. However, we have received merely one application calling for reelection. Taking into account that there are 116 candidates in the fray for the 25 seats, discontentment is bound to be there.â€�

Meanwhile, Dhillon claimed that the second and final phase of polling at district and sub-divisional courts in Punjab and Haryana passed smoothly, in stark contrast to the mayhem at the high court on Friday.

Whereas polling was by and large peaceful in Haryana, some complaints were received from contesting candidates in Ferozepur and Batala. Also, a poll observer was manhandled in Amritsar. The matter has been reported to the deputy commissioner. The counting of votes is slated to commence on November 26.

20,Activist Priyanka takes the plunge into politics,"AMETHI: Would she? Wouldn''t she? These are all speculations of the past. For, Priyanka has hit the dusty lanes of her mother''s constituency, signalling her plunge into politics in the home state of the Nehru-Gandhis.

And what is even more significant is that for starters she has decided to turn herself into an activist and not just a political paratrooper from 10, Janpath, New Delhi.

Ask the thanedar of Sangrampur police station in Amethi how he felt when Priyanka Vadra Gandhi stormed into his office unannounced to plead the case of a Dalit whose house had been dismantled by a local BJP strongman.

Awestruck, the thanedar didn''t know what to do. He sat on his seat speechless and the heir apparent of the dynasty refused to leave the police station without getting an FIR registered.

The thanedar''s problem was that he was hardly in a position to take a decision on Priyanka''s request. He was aware of state chief minister Mayawati''s mercurial temperament. He knew he could do nothing unless his departmental bosses gave the go-ahead. Realising the thanedar''s predicament, Priyanka spoke to his senior officials who, in turn, asked him to register the FIR.

The story that preceded all this makes for even more interesting reading. A BJP strongman raided a Dalit''s house, razed it to the ground and grabbed the land. When the Dalit, Shambhunath, went to the police station to lodge an FIR, he was turned away. Fortunately for him, Priyanka was in town and Shambhunath narrated his story to her. Priyanka jumped to his rescue.

This incident apart, Priyanka has been doing the rounds in Amethi with a telling effect. The people of Amethi welcome her with open arms wherever she goes. She makes it a point to visit the homes of the poor, Dalits in particular. â€˜UP ki aandhi, Priyanka Gandhi'' is the new slogan here.

Away in the Nehru Bhavan in Lucknow, headquarters of the state Congress, party leaders appeared to be almost certain that Priyanka would contest the next Lok Sabha election from her grandmother''s constituency, Rae Bareily. Priyanka, however, evaded a direct reply about her plans. ""Wait and see"", she said.

On a whirlwind tour of different assembly segments of Amethi on Saturday, she inquired about the reasons behind the party''s poor performance in the last assembly elections.

For three hours, Priyanka met different Congress delegations and the locals in an effort to renew her contact and gauge their mood.

The Congress workers utilised this opportunity to also apprise her of the growing infighting in the party unit. Priyanka distributed tri-cycles to the handicapped persons and also visited patients at the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital.
