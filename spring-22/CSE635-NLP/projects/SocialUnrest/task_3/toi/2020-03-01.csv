0,Woman rescued from in-laws in Durg Vijayganj,"LUCKNOW: Married barely a month ago, a 22-year-old woman was allegedly held hostage by her husband and was being allegedly forced into flesh trade when she was rescued by the police.

Reports said that a resident of Durg Vijayganj in Naka police circle, this 22-year-old girl was married to one Vikas Gulathi of Chander Nagar on January 22 last. Claiming to be a salesman with a national brand of tea, Vikas also owned a shop at Ansal City Centre near Tulsi Community Centre where he lived with his wife as well.

Vikas had allegedly converted the shop for residing purposes. On Saturday, the girl''s mother reached Ansal City Centre to meet his daughter but found the entrance locked from outside.

Suspecting foul play she informed the Mahila Police station stating that there were indications that her daughter was held hostage inside the house.

The police reached the site and broke open the lock to find the visibly frightened girl. She was brought to the police station where she alleged that Vikas was running a flesh trade racket and was forcing her into it as well. When she resisted, he confined her into the house.

1,Reel models take a toll on real life daughters-in-law,"KOLKATA: Reshmi Sehgal, who gave up her job last year, was prepared to adjust with her in-laws, managing the kitchen and housework after marriage.

What the 25-year-old was not prepared for were the demands by her mother-in-law and husband, who wanted her to be dressed like small screen bahus Tulsi and Parvati.

Her new world came crashing down when this simple but practical woman drew a line on such expectations.

Sehgal''s is not an isolated case. According to Women''s Sahayog, a city-based NGO working on women''s issues, demands on daughter-in-laws to assume tele-serial roles - physically as well as mentally - are on the rise with eight to ten cases being registered every month.

""These television serials, particularly Kyunki... and Kahani..., convey orthodox concepts and perspectives in the guise of Indian culture and traditional values. Tensions are bound to build up when motherin-laws compare the reel images to their daughter-in-laws,"" Sahayog president Kusum Jain said.

According to her, ""Problems arise once the daughters-in-law begin to speak out, because Tulsi and Parvati don''t confront their in-laws.""

Filmmaker Ananya Chatterjee agreed that television had a far-reaching impact on women. ""It''s not only about ideal daughter-in-laws. These serials reflect kitchen politics and power struggle among women in a family. Such plastic role models undergo all this with a smile, which in real-life situations can be traumatic.""

""The growing popularity of such imaginary characters puts an indirect pressure on women to succumb to values which prevent them from standing up for their rights,"" said women''s rights activist Maitrayee Chatterjee, who watches these serials to get an insight about their influence in daily lives.

""All the good women or role models reflect the age-old tradition, giving up their careers and being good housewives. And whoever deviates from that is a bad modern woman,"" said a senior activist.

Most victims fail to realise women have fought a long way to come out of homes and settle for professional careers, she added.

2,3 bookies arrested for betting,"HYDERABAD: The commissioner''s task force teams arrested three bookies since Friday, who had been running a betting racket in the city ever since the World Cup cricket matches began.

The west zone team raided Sairam Estates in Ameerpet on Friday night and arrested V Sitharamaraju, A Siddareddy and T Ramireddy. Sitharamaraju, a resident of KPHB Colony, in association with the two others, had been accepting bets from the punters.

3,Nalsar drafting law on child labour,"HYDERABAD: The National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (Nalsar) University of Law is in the process of drafting a legislation for the abolition of child labour with the support of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

The drafting committee constituted by the Nalsar faculty members and their students with the support of the ILO and guest faculty that includes attorney general and judges of high courts and the Supreme Court will finalise the draft.

The final draft legislation on abolition of child labour will be presented to the state legislature in about two weeks, Nalsar University of Law registrar Dr A Lakshminath told The Times of India on Saturday.

""The chief minister has assured all support as he is committed to eradicate the child labour menace and he wants AP to have the distinction of being the first state to abolish this practice,"" he said.

The fourth year law students of the university who had taken active part in preparing the draft legislation include Viplav Sharma, Swetha Balakrishna and Sukanya Pani.

The university has planned to introduce two centres for research on environmental law and intellectual property rights.

4,Students display their legal skills at law festival,"HYDERABAD: The Summons 2003 - the first all-India inter-college law fest - began at the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (Nalsar) University of Law at Justice City, Shameerpet on Saturday.

Students from seven law colleges from across the country are taking part in the four-day event.

Inaugurating the event, Nalsar registrar Dr A Lakshminath complimented Nalsar students for their efforts in organising the festival. He said such programmes would help students improve their innate talent and prepare them for a bright future.

The programmes began with the ''moot court competition'' in which six teams from various law colleges took part. The focus was on the role of lawyers and judges in a scenario where cases are dragged on for years and the common man incurs huge legal costs for knocking the doors of judiciary.

Given the scenario, should lawyers have a right to strike work and make litigation more tedious, inefficient and expensive ? Or is the lawyer''s right to strike similar to any other agitation? These were some of the critical questions the students discussed at moot court.

Drawing on principles of administrative and constitutional law, the students made insightful and precise arguments on whether the legislature be allowed to play a more pro-active role in ensuring accountability or would that violate the separation of powers principle that ensures the accountability of judges.

The preliminary round of the moot court competition was judged by advocates of the High Court. If the quality of the students'' performance was anything to go by, one could judge that the law was in safer hands.

The ''moot court'' semi-final competition will be held on March 2 and the finals on March 4. The moot court prelims will be followed by a quiz and skit programme. On Sunday, competitions will be held on creative writing, sketching, painting, cross word, debate, moot court semis, choreography, mad ads and a cultural programme.

The second day''s programmes will include collage, quiz, drafting, debate finals, western classical, sports and cultural events.

Dumb charades, moot court finals, sports will be held on the final day and the programme will conclude on March 4 with a Hyderabadi food festival, movie screenings and rock shows including ''Moksha'' and ''Civil Wrongs'' presented by the students.

5,Congress routs BJP in Himachal elections,"NEW DELHI: The Congress party''s decisive victory in Himachal was the most striking outcome of the state assembly polls to four small, largely mountain, states last week.

The party scored an important victory in Meghalaya as well, but appeared to be on a losing wicket in Nagaland. While the anti-incumbency mood seems to be the dominant factor in these elections, the ruling Left Front bucked the trend and steam-rollered the opposition led by the Congress in Tripura.

The victory in Himachal provides the Congress valuable breathing space and an important psychological boost as it gears up for the semi-finals - the elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan later this year - and the finals, the general election sometime thereafter.

Former state chief minister Virbhadra Singh was a victor in more ways than one. He won his own seat at Rohru convincingly and at the same time, had the satisfaction of seeing his main rival, Vidya Stokes, defeated in Kumarsain. Stokes was defeated by a Congress rebel and the presence of such rebels in both camps was a major factor in polls.

BJP leaders blamed them for their poor showing but a closer look at the result shows that it was the Congress rebels who fared better, winning some four of the 18 seats they contested.

Though Sukh Ram retained his Mandi seat, his Himachal Vikas Party fared poorly and vindicated Virbhadra''s anti-Sukh Ram stance. For the record, the BJP did not stress Hindutva in the campaign, choosing to push ''vikas'' or development agenda. But the Congress was able to capitalise the anti-corruption and anti-incumbency mood in the state.

The victories in the small hill states may cheer the Congress somewhat, but they ought to be worried about the defeat of their candidate at the Gauriganj bypoll in UP at the hands of the BSP candidate.

The massive victory of the ruling PDP in the Pampore by-election confirms the fact that the National Conference remains in the doghouse in the Valley and that Mufti Mohammed Sayeed has been able to consolidate his position there.

The Meghalaya outcome indicates that Purno Sangma has not been able to emerge as the undisputed leader of the entire state.

In Nagaland, the Naga People''s Front along with components of the NDA like the BJP, Samata and JDU could form the next government. The NPF is said to be close to the NSCN (I-M) and has gained from the fact that the dialog it has entered into with the Centre appears to be working.

6,Marandi to follow party diktat,"RANCHI: Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi, who apprised central BJP leaders in New Delhi of the political crisis in the state on Saturday, said he will abide by the party''s directive.

Marandi, who returned from Delhi in the evening, said he had informed the leaders about the current situation in the state. ""Things will be sorted out through dialogue,"" Marandi had met BJP leaders L K Advani, Yashwant Sinha, Venkaiah Naidu and Rajnath Singh.

He, however, did not elaborate what transpired at the meeting with the senior leaders.

The group of five dissidents - Madhu Singh, Bachcha Singh, Ramesh Singh Munda, Jaleswar Mahato (all Samata) and Lalchand Mahato (JD-U) - had been convinced by Nitish Kumar''s emissary Lallan Singh to visit Delhi and place their demand on March 3.

7,Delay in border demining hits farmers,"NEW DELHI: Harcharan Singh Pattu, sarpanch of Khemkaran village in Punjab is a disillusioned man. His six-acre farm along the Indo-Pak border was mined by the Army at the launch of Operation Parakram. He''s still waiting for it to be de-mined.

""It has been 14 months since the army took over my land. I was given compensation for last year''s wheat crop at the rate of Rs 11,000 per acre. How far will this money taken me? I have 12 family members and eight heads of cattle to feed. I have lost three crops since last January and am awaiting further compensation,"" he says.

There are thousands of farmers like him along the border. Take Nirmal Singh of Rajocanna village in Punjab. ""Farming is my only source of livelihood. How can I survive if the army does not give us quick compensation on a per crop basis?""

Army sources confirm it took over 70,000 hectares of land; more than one-third of cultivable land was mined with an estimated one million mines. And they admit, so far only 30 per cent of land has been de-mined.

Simranjit Singh Mann, MP, says, ""The compensation being demanded by the farmers runs into several crores. So far, they''ve not received even a quarter of this amount.""

The Centre has sanctioned compensation of Rs 66 crore and Rs 54 crore for Punjab and Rajasthan respectively. An MoD spokesman said, ""Compensation will be given on the basis of assessments made by district officials.""

The farmers contend that only 10 per cent have received compensation. The army''s figures are way above this: 70 per cent in Punjab, 50 per cent in Rajasthan and 40 per cent in J&K.

Another worry for the farmers is the time-frame of the de-mining exercise. They want their fields back soon. Unfortunately, the army is reported to have de-mined the 20,000 hectare stretch from Kashmir to Rajasthan using vintage ND-Mark 11 and Mark-V mines.

8,Notice to Delhi govt on staff nurses selection,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has issued a notice to the Delhi government on a petition challenging the selection process for appointing staff nurses on the ground that the general category candidates were not given due representation and results were declared without a merit list.

Taking cognizance of a writ petition by a candidate whose plea in this regard was rejected by the Central Administrative Tribunal earlier, a Bench comprising Justice D K Jain and Justice Madan B Lokur, while issuing notice to Delhi government, sought its reply by May 23.

""The Government has declared the results of staff nurses without preparing the merit list. This fact is quite evident from the note appended to the result declared on October 12, 2002 by the respondent,"" said the petition by Manidra, who also had taken the examination.

""The CAT has overlooked the provisions of law about the reservation of posts as out of 866 vacancies of nurces, only 37 were allotted to the general category candidates while 200 were earmarked for SC, 173 to ST and 456 to OBCs,"" the writ petition said.

""The Government has violated the Supreme Court directive and the Union Government''s notification which clearly state in any case the reservation quota should not exceed 50 per cent in a year,"" it said.

Manidra''s counsel Surat Singh claimed CAT, though in its order of January 31 had mentioned it ''deprecates'' the practice of declaring the results without drawing a merit list, yet it did not agree to set aside the selection process.

9,Ranbaxy approaches HC against govt's demand,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has sought a reply from the government on a petition by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd challenging the show cause notice by National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority (NPPA) demanding Rs 2.59 crore allegedly overcharged from the public on the sale of drug Pentazocine without reducing the price after official notification.

Directing the company to deposit Rs one crore with the government, Justice C K Mahajan restrained the government from taking steps to recover the money from Ranbaxy subject to the court order.

Ranbaxy had sought quashing of NPPA''s show-cause notice demanding the allegedly overcharged money as well as restraining the government from taking any action to recover the amount.

The NPPA alleged that Ranbaxy sold the built-up stock of Pentazocine injections without revising the price notified by the government and made profit at public cost.

The Centre''s counsel Maninder Singh told the court that though Ranbaxy was exempted from the operation of price control under Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO) up to October 1999, the drug was to be sold on a fixed price after the exemption period.

Ranbaxy''s counsel Rajiv Nayar contended that the amount of overcharging has been arrived at in an inaccurate manner and the company was not given opportunity for personal hearing, while demanding the amount with 15 per cent interest on it.

He said it was during the exemption period that the stocks were delivered to the distributors and the retailers.

The NPPA issued the demand notice for the overcharged money on Februrary 13 while the show cause notice was served on April 29, 2002.

10,"Dawood kin's case transferred, lawyers baffled","MUMBAI: Abrupt transfer of the investigation in a murder case involving Iqbal Shaikh Kaskar, younger brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, from a local police station to the Crime Branch has baffled legal circles even as a magistrate has asked cops to explain on Monday why they need police custody of the accused beyond 14 days.

The transfer of investigations from M R A Marg police station to the Crime Branch has surprised legal circles here as it came at the fag end of the trial in a sessions court. In this case, four other accused have been discharged and two others are facing trial although they have secured bail.

Iqbal had also informed the court that he had come to India on his own accord. If he is to be believed then he should be given a fair opportunity to defend himself, legal sources said. But if he is on the wrong side of law then he has to face the consequences, they said.

Iqbal was arrested on February 20 allegedly for murder of a customs informer. He was arrested at airport on arrival from Dubai after being deported by authorities. He was remanded to police custody till March six and probe entrusted to M R A Marg police station which registered the crime in 1998.

The Crime Branch stepped into the case a week after Iqbal''s arrest and took over investigations. They produced him before another magistrate who remanded him to custody till March 14.

Iqbal''s lawyers Ayaz Khan and Sham Keswani argued the police custody could be granted only for the first 15 days and not beyond that period. The court, as such, gave notice to the Crime Branch to explain on March three why they needed police custody beyond 15 days.

Iqbal has been struggling to come to India since last two years. He had filed a petition in Supreme Court urging for a direction to Government of India to restore his passport which had been cancelled earlier, legal sources said.

Iqbal pleaded before the Supreme Court that he was not a criminal and wanted to come to India. The apex court asked him to move the authorities in India before knocking at its door.

Accordingly, he filed applications in passport office and other authorities pleading for restoration of his passport. When he could not get a favourable response, he moved the Supreme Court once again.

In 2002, the apex court issued notices to all the states to disclose if Iqbal was wanted in any cases in their respective areas, the sources added.

Maharashtra Government informed the Supreme Court that Iqbal was wanted by M R A Marg police station in Mumbai in a murder case of a customs informer. The apex court then advised him to move the Mumbai High Court for appropriate reliefs. He then filed a petition in High Court and the matter is pending.

11,Ludhiana SP blown out by 'political games',"LUDHIANA: Politics is said to be behind the sudden transfer of SP City II, Naunihal Singh, to the headquarters. While DGP, MS Bhullar, IG of Jalandhar zone, SK Sharma, and other senior officers who visited the city on Friday evaded the issue during a press meet, highly placed sources say the move has served at least two political purposes.

The campaign against Naunihal was reportedly initiated two months ago on a complaint by Rakesh Pandey, minister for printing and stationery. Pandey had intervened in a police case in which Naunihal was interrogating a local Congress party worker, Ashwani Kumar, for charges of corruption.

Pandey says he wanted Ashwani released and had gone to the CIA staff office, where he asked the in-charge to let Ashwani out of the cell. Pandey says Naunihal arrived when he was talking to Ashwani and took away the latter to another police station.

This piqued Pandey, who says, ''''Being minister, I was more or less the government for the police official and he dealt with me in an offensive manner.''''

Pandey says the common man can expect little courtesy from the police when even a minister was treated thus.

He says he then took up the matter with the chief minister, pursued it for two months and saw the officer transferred. Harmanbir Singh Gill, who was earlier DSP at Sarabhanagar in Ludhiana, is also believed to have a hand in the transfer.

His brother Dimpa Gill is MLA from Beas constituency and is said to have some influence with Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

Sources say the CM was asked by the party president to promote Dimpa''s brother Harmanbir as SP and accommodate him in Ludhiana.

Naunihal''s sudden transfer has thus not only placated the minister but also left coveted post vacant for Gill to fill up.

13,"With children, written word still rules","JALANDHAR: After the brief infatuation with the electronic media, the written word is beginning to re-assert itself and cast its magic spell on tiny minds, if the experimental tour through Punjab of the National Book Trust mobile unit is any indication.

Not only is it being proved true here that the written word will survive the ravages of the TV, but even in the rest of the country too, wherever children have been exposed to flights of fantasy and fairy tales.

At present NBT''s mobile units are blazing a literary trail through the villages of Andhra Pradesh and Assam. Children belong to a different world which cuts across all geographic boundaries.

Yuri Olov''s ''Dadi Unndi Hey'' is a favourite among the children of Punjab. So are other Bengali, Marathi, Kannad and other writers. Ruskin Bond''s ''Rusty de Karnamey'' is a big hit and children flocked to buy this book in the villages.

Others that were lapped up by the small and the young were ''Mitha Atey Jadoo di Jutti, Suraj Mukhi te Titlian, Shahukar, Chanchal Balri Mamoo, Birju te Usda Uddna Ghora, Suraj Atay Chandrama, Swami te Usdey Yaar â€” Bolu tey Golu, Deepu Gadhey de Karnamey, Aao Sappan noo Janniya'' and many more.

''''We started our tour in Chandigarh where we sold books worth Rs 34,282 from February 3 to 6. After that our next stop was Nawanshahr and Mukandpur where we sold books worth Rs 40,423. Children are hungry for good literature. Its the system that has done away with the leisurely reading habit. Even elders have lost their sensitivity. They have strangled the child that is present in each adult,"" said Deep Bhatia, editor of the Punjabi section in NBT, and in-charge of the mobile unit, while talking to TNN at the end of the tour here on Friday.

It was an eye-opener for seasoned writers here that children came out with money to buy books in Tuhalwala village in Gurdaspur district books worth Rs 17,180 were sold. Bhatia added that in Pathankot it was Rs 24,815 and in Amritsar Rs 29,198.

''''In Malwa region where we touched Patiala, Moga, Faridkot, Mansa and Bathinda we had sold books worth Rs 2,47,365 to children. The best response was from the rural schools. Urban schools with their elitist bias were not so responsive,"" said Bhatia.

Jagtar Singh, Sahitya Akademy award winner, said, ''''Translations of Russian classics transformed our sensibilities in the 50s and 60s. Now the reading habit has taken a beating from the moving image. Our universities are supposed to have done the job that the NBT is doing now. But the teachers in our universities have been simply collecting salaries and not doing anything constructive. They have not even been able to create a single dictionary better than Bhai Kahan Singh''s Mahan Kosh. Teachers themselves have lost the reading habit, so how will they encourage children.""

14,Punjab govt violating poll code: BJP,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab BJP has accused the state government of violating the election code of conduct by issuing a series of advertisements and announcing policy decisions in a bid to woo urban voters on the eve of the civic elections.

The elections to the 78 local bodies are slated for March 9, while elections to 13 civic bodies took place on Sunday. Addressing a joint press conference here on Sunday, Punjab BJP chief Brij Lal Rinwa and veteran BJP leader Balramji Dass Tandon said that the chief minister''s announcement that octroi would be abolished in July this year amounted to gross violation of the election code.

Besides, they said, the government had been issuing advertisements on completion of its one year in office, which too was in violation of the code.

Rinwa and Tandon said they had already conveyed their sentiments to the state election commission and would formally submit a memorandum in a day or so.

Suggesting that the party may approach court, they said that they were obtaining legal opinion on whether the party could move the high court on the violation of election code.

Tandon said that the election code had been adopted by all political parties and must be adhered to in all elections.

""In the Himachal Pradesh elections, the election commission had even removed all the hoardings highlighting the government''s achievements,'''' said Tandon, arguing that the Punjab government can''t issue such an advertisement at the time of elections.

The BJP leaders also accused the ruling party of misusing official machinery to keep out BJP nominees from the civic body polls by manipulating rules. They alleged that the BJP nominees were being pressurised and threatened into withdrawing from the contest.

The ruling party has also been charged with registering bogus voters in large numbers. Since the wards are small, even a hundred bogus voters can tilt the scales.

""In Derabassi, there were 163 voters who were not residents of ward 3, while 57 voters were registered from a house in ward 7,'''' they alleged.

The BJP leaders alleged that the ruling party was misusing official machinery and the Punjab police to advance its electoral prospects in the municipal council polls much the same way as it did during the municipal corporation, zila parishad and panchayat samiti elections.

15,Civilians clash at border over cricket,"FEROZEPUR: That an India-Pakistan cricket match generates emotions other than sporting spirit was evident at the Hussainiwala border checkpost on Sunday evening when Indian and Pakistani spectators, who had come to watch the beating-the-retreat ceremony, started throwing stones and hurling abuses at each other as if shouting slogans was not enough.

India had convincingly defeated Pakistan in a crucial World Cup encounter on Saturday. Border Security Force personnel and Pakistan Rangers had to use minor force to disperse the agitated spectators.

The situation turned ugly when some Pakistani spectators tried to instigate the Indian spectators led by local MLA Sukhpal Singh Nannu with some objectionable remark. But it did not stop at that.

Some of them started throwing stones towards the Indian side, hurting some of the spectators. Ten people were admitted to hospitals with head injuries. The Ferozepur deputy commissioner and the sub-divisional magistrate rushed to the spot to assess the situation, which was brought under control by then.

Later, talking to Times News Network, Sukhpal alleged that Pakistani spectators had preplanned the attack on Indian fans. Meanwhile, it was a belated Diwali in other border villages.

Villagers of Attari, Theikala and Rattankalla came out of their houses to distribute sweets. All these villages are a stoneâ€™s throw from the border.

16,Murder accused graces political party's banner,"MUMBAI: Motor mechanic Cyril Macwan''s photograph appeared on the ''wanted'' list of Bandra police station in December 1994 as a man accused of murder.

Eight years later, the same face graced the banner of a political party. The banner, wishing residents of Bandra a merry Christmas and a happy new year,was Mr Macwan''s way of flaunting his position as the secretary of the Mumbai north-west district of the Nationalist Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

For good measure, he had added in the banner the photo of NCP leader and deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who holds the home portfolio, apparently without his knowledge.

Mr Macwan''s rising clout has alarmed Irene Kapadia, the widow of the man who was allegedly murdered by Mr Macwan. She has sought the assistance of local social activist Edwin Britto in her quest for justice.

Mr Macwan, a resident of Pereira Wadi at Bandra''s Pali Naka, is the prime accused in the murder of his neighbour Ashok Kapadia, a crane operator. The first information report filed on December 8, 1994, says he stabbed Kapadia (35) in the chest with a knife.

""It happened in a late night brawl,"" said Kisan Shengal, senior inspector of Bandra police station, who had investigated the case. Irene Kapadia told TNN that Mr Macwan was arrested in his ancestral village in Gujarat and brought to Mumbai,where he spent a fortnight in the police lock-up. ""The case against Macwan has not come up for hearing even once and he is telling everyone that it has been dropped,"" said Ms Kapadia.

Mr Macwan told TNN that he had acted in self-defence and that the case was in court. Mr Shengal said the case would come up for hearing in the sessions court.

The chief of the NCP''s city unit, Chandrakant Tripathi, and of its youth wing, Narendra Verma, claimed that they were not aware of anybody by the name Macwan in their organisations. ""But since TNN has brought this matter to my notice I will inquire and take action against Macwan,"" Mr Tripathi said.

NCP''s Bandra taluka president Vijay Shivtare said he was unaware of Mr Macwan''s history. ""No political party checks the antecedents of those who want to enrol,"" he said. However, he admitted that there were complaints against Mr Macwan.

Santosh Dhuvale, Bandra taluka president of the Nationalist Youth Congress, said he could not take action against Mr Macwan merely on the basis of an allegation.Mr Britto said people were scared to complain against Mr Macwan to authorities as he flaunted his proximity with a top politician.

Asked why the party was tolerating a person with a murder charge, Mr Dhuval said it was only an allegation. ""Going by this, Naryayan Rane, who was one of the accused in a murder case, should not have become the chief minister of Maharashtra,"" he retorted.

""I need workers and Mr Macwan is popular in Pali Village for helping the locals. If I sack him on the basis of an allegation, I will face flak from my party bosses,""Mr Dhuvale said, insisting that he was not protecting anyone.
