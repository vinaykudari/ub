8,Ban on SIMI not ruled out: Advani,"lucknow: union home minister l.k. advani on saturday did not rule out the possibility of a ban on the students islamic movement of india (simi) and said that the government was apprised of the matter. ""simi's recent activities are a matter of grave concern,"" advani told newsmen at a press conference here soon after his arrival from new delhi. he was here to meet old-timers of the erstwhile jana sangh and office-bearers of the state bjp to gear up for the forthcoming assembly elections in up. he did not mince words in denouncing the simi and said that the government was aware of its activities. reports were being collected on them from different quarters. a demand for a ban on the organisation had already been made by some states, he said, adding the government had to follow certain procedures laid down under the unlawful activities act for this purpose. the government had to submit its report before a judicial tribunal before taking any such decision, he said. talking tough against pakistan, he said that india was ready for a peaceful settlement of the kashmir issue, but on our own terms. a meaningful outcome of negotiations was possible only when pakistan refused to recognise terrorism in kashmir as a part of jehad (freedom movement), he said. ""our problem is that we are fighting a proxy war in kashmir, which is more difficult to tackle than an open war,"" advani reasoned, saying this was why there was difficulty in wiping out cross-border terrorism. he, however, said that despite odds, the situation was showing signs of improvement and claimed that more militants than ever had been tracked down by security personnel in the last one year. this was reflected from the fact that this year alone the valley had been visited by six lakh tourists, the highest number in the last one decade. earlier, advani exuded confidence that the bjp would fare well in the assembly elections and said that the credit for the improved prospects of the party went to its present leadership in the state. admitting that the bjp, too, was plagued by ills like any other political party, advani said that the greatest challenge before it was not only to get majority and form government, but also to fulfill the aspirations of the people. he further said that the party should be conscious of its image and strive hard for probity in public life. he suggested that not only winability, but also credibility should be the criteria for selection of party candidates. asked as to why the bjp had given ministerial berths to those having criminal antecedents, advani said that it was a political compulsion of the party to run the government. ""we wanted to dispel the doubt that a non-congress party cannot run the government,"" advani said, adding the problem would be over once the party got a full mandate.

9,Soldiers' children lose out to domicile rules,"surat: for 18-year-old nagesh mullick (name changed), the hope of getting into one of the polytechnic institutes of the state got shattered recently. after being shortlisted, he got a regret note from the authorities that he could not be admitted as he was not a domicile of gujarat. reason being, he had to accompany his father, an ex-defence personnel, through all his postings at different locations in several states in a service span of over 24 years. his father after serving the indian army for over two decades with several outstation postings, including the one in sri lanka with the indian peace keeping force, is finding hard to identify a state of his own. he as such has nothing to lose, but his children have been left in a 'stateless' status, which means being deprived of certain privileges in terms of education and jobs. born and brought up at kharagpur in west bengal, followed by a long stint with the indian army, after retirement from the services, nagesh's father got a job in the telecom department with the posting at surat. today, nagesh and his elder brother have no domicile status in the state, as both of them could not complete 10 years of uninterrupted stay in gujarat at a time when they could have been bracketed with the locals to be considered for admission and even for jobs in defence services from gujarat quota. hundreds of ex-servicemen like nagesh, who have settled in gujarat after serving the defence forces, are struggling to establish their domicile for getting registered at employment exchanges or getting admission and jobs for their children. says lt col (retd) a.k.s. dudani, ""instead of giving access to certain facilities, retired personnel in gujarat are being bogged down by the unfair rules. an ex-serviceman hailing from punjab now settled down in gujarat feels discriminated due to the prevailing norms."" there should be a kind of arrangement from the defence authorities to prevail upon the state governments to make them have access to basic things like education facilities and jobs on par with the locals, he says. when asked, surat district welfare officer kishoresinh gohil said that the education is a state subject and in matters pertaining to the admission, the domicile status is of prime consideration here. when confronted further, he refused to comment on it. generally, students opt for professional courses after class xii when one is around 17 years of age, but it is very difficult to spend 10 years at a stretch in gujarat or any state for that matter, as serving in services by their fathers must have entailed several postings at regular intervals across the country and even sometimes abroad, says captain (retd) b.s. jha. when a serviceman retires, he is in his mid- or late 30s, having teenage school-going children. in that situation, how can a student complete 10 years of stay for being eligible for domicile for admission to educational institutions after class xii, he observes. not only this, lack of domicile status also prevents them from being selected for defence jobs from the quota allotted to gujarat state, on the basis of the population. notably, the quota meant for the state is often not filled, he informs. in other states, too, there are time restrictions for domicile status, but they vary from three to five years and most of the time, the ex-defence personnel are given relaxation in this regard by the concerned authorities in many states. several representations in the past many years to district welfare boards, directorate of sainik welfare and resettlement (gujarat) in ahmedabad and directorate of resettlement in new delhi by scores of ex-servicemen with an appeal to do away with the time restrictions for domicile status in gujarat at least for their children, are to get a favourable reply. often applications get routed to 'concerned' departments with a note to look into the matter, according to an aggrieved father. meanwhile, for thousands of ex-servicemen, the agony on the part of their children in being outcast in their own country is something not a happy memory to go along with their patriotic zeal that most of them still cherish even after retirement from the services.

11,Railway laws fail to check enchroachments,"pathankot: ineffective railway laws and the railway board's inability to issue clear-cut guidelines is causing a loss of revenue to the pathankot railway station. while the authorities concerned are turning a blind eye to the encroachments which are increasing by the day, the management's resorting to permit system and its inability to float tenders for the taxi stand is causing loss worth lakhs of rupees to the railways. according to railway sources, there is slackness in the administration, so much so, that it has failed to implement the railway's decision to prohibit the sale of cigarettes in the railway station premises. ""the day senior officials visit the railway station, cigarette rehris are not to be seen, the moment the officials board a train back to ferozepur, the divisional headquarters, the cigarette vendors resurface at the entrance points to the chakki bank railway station,"" said a senior railways official, on condition of anonymity. while the passengers decry the lack of facilities such as drinking water, but on the day senior officials visit, even aquaguards are installed, sources pointed out. admitting the lack of basic facilities at the railway station, senior division commercial manager r d paul, told the times of india: ""efforts are underway to provide better facilities in the waiting room lounge, to ensure 24-hour drinking water supply and maintain cleanliness."" asked way the management was not able to get the encroachments removed, paul, citing the taxi stand and the hprtc cases, said the major problem was 'litigation'. paul said that while encroachments were causing losses to the railway station, archaic railway laws failed to deal firmly with encroachers. asked why tenders were not floated for the taxi stand to earn more revenue, he said, ""it is a policy matter and all policy decisions are taken by the railway board at new delhi. i cannot explain to you why the permit system continues."" while it is an 'open secret' that most of the taxi stand premises were allegedly owned by some of the senior staff, including ticket checkers, paul feigned ignorance about it. on the sale of cigarettes in the railway station premises, paul said that he had marked a departmental inquiry and found such reports to be 'false'. on the sorry state of affairs at the railway station, an official said, ""even surprise visits of senior officials from ferozepur do not prove of much help, as the information on their visits reaches, here, a day in advance. files are seen at high-level meetings, decisions are taken on paper, but things are back to square one as soon as the official departs. there is lack of implementation. meanwhile, the encroachments and the 'frequent visits' of officials continue to take place.""
