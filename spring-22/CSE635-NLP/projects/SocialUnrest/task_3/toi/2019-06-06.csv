0,Another MLA quits DF govt,"MUMBAI: With yet another Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator withdrawing support to the Congress-led Democratic Front government, the mood was upbeat in the Shiv Sena-BJP camp on Wednesday.

Shirish Kotwal was the fourth NCP legislator walk out of the DF coalition.

â€œWe are on a safe wicket. We will accomplish the task of dislodging the Vilasrao Deshmukh government. Many more are on their way to joining our ranks,â€™â€™ leader of the opposition Narayan Rane of the Shiv Sena said.

Senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde claimed that four Congress MLAs were ready and willingâ€™â€™ to sever ties with the DF coalition. â€œI have the letters of two of them. Moreover, 11 more NCP MLAs are set to follow suit. The DF government will come down like a pack of cards.â€™â€™

Meanwhile, in a bid to stall the saffron combineâ€™s poaching, senior DF leaders on Wednesday directed ministers to take responsibility of two MLAs each. â€œEvery minister has been asked to shift at least two MLAs to his official residence for the next week or so. There are 50 ministers and the Congress-NCP combine has a strength of 135 MLAs. This way, the MLAs will be secure and the minister will be responsible for their presence in the legislative assembly on the day of the special session,â€™â€™ a DF minister said.

Earlier in the day, Mr Kotwal called on governor P.C. Alexander to inform him that he no longer supported the DF government. Senior Sena MLAs Gajanan Kirtikar and Nandkumar Kale reportedly accompanied Mr Kotwal to Raj Bhavan.

Mr Kotwalâ€™s coup de grace to the DF government coincided with the coalition flaunting its trump card: the anti-defection law.

In letter to assembly speaker Arunlal Gujarathi, the NCP legislature party sought action against three party MLAsâ€”Narsing Patil, Shivaji Naik and Narayan Pawarâ€”who had on Tuesday withdrawn support to the government.

Mr Gujarathi has set a sevenday deadline for the legislators to explain their stand.

According to political observers, the showcause notice is a clever move by the state government to keep its flock together in the runup to the show of strength on the floor of the assembly.

Following a rash of withdrawals over the last two days that has reduced the DF government to a minority, the governor on Tuesday directed chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh to prove the majority of his government within ten days on the floor of the assembly.

Vidhan Bhavan sources said a special one-day session of the state assembly would be convened on June 13 for the purpose.

Stating that he would personally hear out the three NCP MLAs, Mr Gujarathi said, â€œI am perusing the antecedents in such matters. If necessary, I shall consult constitutional experts.â€™â€™

However, Mr Rane contested the legality of the showcause notices and claimed that the NCP legislators would in no way invite disqualification under the anti-defection law.

â€œThe speaker has no locus standi to seek explanation from a legislator for an act which the latter has committed outside the assembly. The MLAs met the governor at Raj Bhavan, which is out of the speakerâ€™s purview. Moreover, the anti-defection law comes into operation only if a legislator violates the party whip. This has not happened in this case as the MLAs had gone to the governor to inform him that they no longer wished to support the DF government,â€™â€™ Mr Rane said.

He added: â€œThe speaker needs a good legal adviser.â€™â€™

2,‘Defeat won’t affect NDA government’,"RANCHI: Jharkhand science and technology minister Samresh Singh on Tuesday said the results of the Dumka Lok Sabha bypoll will not have any impact on the ruling coalition in the state.

""The NDA coalition, led by Babulal Marandi, is as intact as ever,"" Singh, who represnts the Jharkhand Vananchal Congress, one of the coalition partners, said.

He felt the reverses suffered by the BJP at the hands of JMM in the Dumka bypoll was the result of ""over-confidence.""

JMM chief Shibu Soren on Sunday won the byelection defeating his nearest BJP rival Ramesh Hembrom by a margin of 94,235 votes.

""A certain amount of smugness on the part of the BJP may have led to its defeat in Dumka,"" Singh said.

Commenting on the recent row between the BJP and the Samata over the lone Rajya Sabha seat from the state, Singh said the ""amicable settlement of the issue underscores the in-built cohesion within the ruling NDA coalition in Jharkhand.""

3,Companies offer insurance policy for overseas travellers,"CHANDIGARH: Adil Sheikh, a topper from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, had bagged a three months scholarship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA was a dream come true and he was all set to go but for a small problem.

The corrosive Delhi air had resulted in his becoming prone to bronchitis. And the prohibitive costs of health delivery systems in USA meant a heavy burden on his family.

But help was at hand. Adil brought an overseas travel insurance policy offered by a private insurance firm. For a premium of Rs 6,000, he was covered under hospitalisation and personal liability to the extent of $ 200,000 in case he falls ill seriously.

Overseas travel insurance is the latest among a host of new services offered by the private insurance companies that has attracted the eye of the customer due to its protection cover for matters as diverse as getting hijacked or repatriation of the body in case of death.

These policies have been popular in insurance markets in the developed world. However, the Indian customers are getting exposed to such niche products for the first time. Some of the contingencies against which a traveller receives cover are simply amazing.

For example, the policy provides benefits including emergency evacuation in case the person falls sick and needs to be transported for better medical attention. And what is more the insurance company will pay $ 30 per day in case one gets hijacked while travelling abroad.

The policy also provides coverage for loss of baggage, delay in receiving baggage and loss of passport. Added to this is the house burglary coverage. The customer is insured against theft in case his house gets burgled while he is travelling abroad.

If you are a bad driver and have got involved in a legal case by smashing the rented car against somebody, the insurance company will raise a bail bond to the maximum limit of $ 5,000.

With services like these the customers are in for service standards that are at par with some of the most developed countries of the world.

In India so far the service is being provided by a private insurance company in tie-up with a leading travel agency which also provides money transfer services. Says a city based executive of the company, â€˜â€˜The policy has been launched recently and is targeted at the upmarket clientele who travel abroad frequently.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Individuals go for it for different reasons. One of the customers purchased it because he was a habitual loser of his baggage on international flights,â€™â€™ the executive says.

4,'Godse' joins 'Gandhi' to condemn violence,"PUNE: This Nathuram Godse has full police protection whenever he makes a public appearance.

When he performed to a full house at the Balgandharva Rang Mandir on Tuesday, at least five policemen were waiting in the wing while some more sat in the audience ready to shoot down any trouble.

Yet, the inaugural show of the much-talked-about play Mee Nathuram Godse Boltoy went on smoothly in Pune despite demonstrations by Congress workers. In fact, the group of nine artistes who perform in the play have become so used to the morchas and demonstrations that both ''Nathuram Godse'' and ''Mahatma Gandhi'' do not even bat an eyelid while speaking about the traumatic incidents of the past few months. And this includes the burning of their bus by Congress activists in Mumbai on June 1.

""We fail to understand why so much noise is being made about the play even after the judiciary gave its clearance,"" says the fair and hazel-eyed Sharad Ponkshe, who plays Nathuram. ""Sometimes, we feel frustrated and wonder when all this nonsense will end so that we can stage the shows without police protection,"" he remarks.

Neither Ponkshe nor Rajesh Kamble, who plays Mahatma Gandhi, nor Abhijit Chavan, who is inspector Sawant in the play, ever felt that the demonstrations would culminate into the burning of their bus. ""We were terribly disturbed by the incident but, strangely enough, our resolve to continue with the play became even stronger. And none of this ever affected the calibre of our performance or the intensity with which we perform, or even the yearning for perfection,"" remarks Kamble, who is playing Gandhi the second time in his career after Gandhi ani Ambedkar.

At one stage, Kamble did wonder whether the artistes themselves would be attacked next, but he never thought of dropping out of the play. Added to this was the opposition from family members of all the artistes. ""We convinced our families. We told them that we were enjoying full support of the audience wherever we went and there was also the police to protect us,"" he reveals.

""One thing is very clear--those who burnt our bus were certainly not followers of Mahatma Gandhi,"" says Ponkshe, who feels that the role of Nathuram is a milestone in his career. ""I want people to remember me when they think about Nathuram Godse. I want them to say, ''Yes! this is how Nathuram would have looked and behaved,""'' he says, adding that despite the traumatic incident he does not repent having accepted the role. ""It is a very powerful, author-backed character, which has all the shades,"" he points out.

Abhijit Chavan cannot seem to get over the June 1 incident or the way all the artistes and the audience rallied behind the producer and director. ""All the clothes which we wear in the play were burnt along with a part of the set. We were able to procure two dhotis for Rajesh (Gandhi), but the rest of us were wearing jeans and casuals. Yet the audience fully supported us,"" he recalls.

After the three shows in Pune Mee Nathuram... will go to Mumbai, come back to Pune for two more shows and then venture into Marathwada. What with the stiff opposition to the staging of the play, a three-year-long court battle to get it cleared, its author Pradeep Dalvi''s recent outbursts against the play, and his demand for a ban, plus the recent burning of the bus, director Vinay Apte and producer Uday Dhurat have kept ready four sets of the play to overcome any eventuality.

6,CM draws flak for agro policy,"KOLKATA: The state governmentâ€™s proposed agri-business policy is showing signs of snowballing into a major controversy.

Agriculture minister and Forward Bloc leader Kamal Guha has strong reservations to the policy which includes provisions for contract farming by multinationals.

Guha seems to have taken umbrage at the fact that he was ignored while the policy was being framed, while his department officials were consulted by the â€œtop bossesâ€�.

On Tuesday, the department started an agricultural census along with the land and land revenue department to update the database on land use and holding pattern. The last census was done five years back.

â€œUnless I receive all relevant papers and understand the ramifications of the controversial aspects like contract farming, how can I give my opinion? Why the hurry?â€� Guha told TNN.

Both he and small irrigation minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya are busy preparing their dissenting notes for chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the policy, which they feel is more in tune with the WTO regime.

Nandagopal Bhattacharya, too, alleged that they were not consulted while the policy was framed with the help of US-based consultant McKinsey.

â€œI have apprehensions about contract farming by MNCs. This can compromise the interest of small peasants as well as our food security.

â€œBut relevant papers were not given to me. Only some officers of my department were asked to attend some meetings,â€� complained Guha.

State agriculture commissioner Nityananda Trivedi, however, tried to allay these fears.

According to him, the agriculture department buys seeds from â€œregistered growersâ€� who are actually on contract with the government.

â€œCompanies like HLL Cargill have asked for 2,000-3,000 acres contiguous land where they would contract local farmers to grow aromatic rice. They will buy back the product and market it.

Price of products would be fixed by market rates. Ownership of land will not change, nor will companies take the land on lease,â€� he claimed.

7,"HC rejects PIL, LF to fight bandh","KOLKATA: Both Left Front and the High Court on Wednesday queered the pitch for the proposed Bangla Bandh on Friday, June 7.

While the CPM and the state government declared they would actively resist the Bandh, the High Court sarcastically observed that it was pointless to issue any injunction because the government did not have the machinery to enforce it.

â€œIn our state, we have practically quarterly ban-dhs,â€� the HC noted. â€œThe last two bandhs occurred on or about January 10 and April 16; the first was an SUCI Bandh, the next a CPM supported Bandh while the present call has been given by Trinamul Congressâ€�. The division bench comprising Justices Ajoy Nath Ray and Arun Kumar Mitra ad-ded: â€œIt appears that the political contribution of Bengal in recent years is the philosophy of no work and protest without purpose.

As Bengalis, we hang our heads in shame that this should be so.â€� Dismissing a PIL by the Indian Sufi Samaj, asking for an injunction on Fridayâ€™s bandh, the HC observed it was restraining itself from passing an â€œempty order of injunction in the English tradition of looking the other way, when one knows that one is powerless.â€�

The CPM asked its activists to keep vigil on the street and resist attempts to disrupt traffic on Friday. The party will also organise rallies throughout the state on Friday. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said private buses, mini buses and auto-rickshaws wou-ld ply. Government buses would also be run.

8,DF govt agrees to drop Sunil Tatkare,"MUMBAI: In an abject surrender to the Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), the Congress and the NCP leadership on Wednesday agreed to drop Sunil Tatkare once again from the Democratic Front (DF) ministry. With the DF government reduced to a minority in the 288-member assembly, desperate leaders of the coalition made an all-out effort to mollycoddle the PWP.

The current crisis was trigerred off by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukhâ€™s decision to reinduct Tatkare in his team, much against the wishes of the PWP, which was angry with Tatkare for allegedly engineering the defeat of their partyâ€™s nominee for the presidentship of the Raigad zilla parishad.

The two CPM MLAs had earlier pulled out. However, the CPM central leadership has now assured the DF that it would not allow the secular government to crumble.

On Wednesday, Deshmukh went to PWP leader Ganpatrao Deshmukhâ€™s residence and agreed to drop Tatkare. Deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal confirmed that his party was willing to sacrifice Tatkare to defuse the crisis. The PWP leaders, however, said that they would discuss the CMâ€™s offer at a meeting of its executive.

NCP president Sharad Pawar rushed back to Mumbai from Delhi on Tuesday night in an effort to keep his flock together. He held a series of meetings with his MLAs and appealed to them to stay united. He also obliquely warned them that they would invite the provisions of the anti-defection Act if they joined hands with the saffron combine.

He also succeeded in winning back Kolhapur MLA Vinay Kore, who had on Tuesday sent a fax to BJP leader Gopinath Munde declaring the withdrawal of his support to the DF government. After talking to Pawar, Kore issued another statement on Wednesday saying that he was â€˜â€˜misledâ€™â€™ by some people and that he is still with the government.

However, in a day of hectic political activity, the NCP suffered another setback when former Shiv Sena minister Gajanan Kirtikar submitted a letter to the governor signed by NCP MLA Shirish Kotwal.

Pawar also reportedly met rebel NCP MLA Shivajirao Naik, who had called on the governor on Tuesday and withdrawn his support. He told Pawar that he desired some changes in the power- sharing set-up of the party.

Pawar called an impromptu meeting of the NCP legislature party. Four MLAs, apart from the five rebel MLAs were, however, not present. Pawar ruled out any split in the NCP during the trial of strength.

AICC general secretary Vayalar Ravi also held closed door meetings and attended the CLP meeting.

12,NCP minister Sunil Tatkare resigns,"MUMBAI: The controversial NCP MLA Sunil Tatkare, whose re-induction into the Democratic Front government in Maharashtra triggered the political crisis in the state, on Thursday resigned.

Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh told mediapersons here on Thursday evening that Tatkare submitted the resignation letter to him, which has been accepted.

Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), which has five MLAs withdrew support to Deshmukh government protesting the reinduction of Tatkare, who is accused of engineering the defeat of PWP candidate for a Zilla Panchayat chairmanship poll.

The PWP action was followed by a spate of withdrawal of support by 16 more MLAs including independents and those of NCP, JD (S) and Congress.

The chief minister said, Tatkare was neither pressurised to submit resignation nor was he instructed to do so but had acted on his own.

""I have accepted his letter of resignation,"" he said.

In his resignation letter, Tatkare said, if the political crisis was because of him, he would not like to add to the crisis, according to Deshmukh.

""I do not think I am bigger than the state,"" Tatkare said in the letter.

Tatkare''s reinduction on Friday last had sparked off the resignation of three PWP ministers from the Democratic Front government.

Later, the PWP withdrew support to the government, reducing it to minority.

On Wednesday evening, the chief minister had met PWP leader Ganapatrao Desmukh in an apparent bid to woo him back.

19,Trinamul sticks to bandh call,"KOLKATA: The Trinamul Congress stuck to its decision of a Bangla bandh on Friday, turning down chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattachrjeeâ€™s last-ditch effort to bring the party to the negotiating table.

A peeved Bhattacharjee later in the day urged people to judge the credibility of Mamata Banerjeeâ€™s party by its actions.

â€œI had written to Opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee, requesting him to withdraw the bandh call and and meet me at my office. Since they have declined to call off the bandh, the people of the state should judge,â€�said Bhattacharjee.

Meanwhile, speaking to newspesons on Thursday, Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee said that the chief minister was too late in putting forward the proposal for talks. â€œNow it is too late. Had the chief ministerâ€™s proposal come 24 hours earlier, we could have had discussion within the party and done something about it,â€� Mamata said.

The Trinamul supremo, however, kept the talks option open, saying that Opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee will meet the chief minister between June 8 and 10 at any place chosen by him.

Banerjee has urged Trinamul workers not to get provoked by CPM cadres.

Reacting sharply to the Trinamul Congressâ€™ refusal to withdraw the bandh, Left Front chairman Biman Bose appealed to the people to reject the anti-people strike and asked them to take adequate steps to make the bandh a total failure.

In a rebuttal to Trinamulâ€™s argument that the chief ministerâ€™s appeal for a discussion had come too late, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said, â€œWhen the Prime Minister summons Mamata Banerjee, she rushes to Delhi within an hour. Yet she canâ€™t go to Writersâ€™ Buildings from Kalighat in a dayâ€™s notice.â€�

CPM activists have been asked to organise anti-bandh rallies in every locality all over the state from early in the morning and to keep vigil at street corners to prevent possible attempts by Trinamul supporters to disrupt traffic on Friday.

26,HC admits plea challenging Mallya election,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka High Court on Thursday admitted an election petition challenging the election of Vijay Mallya to the Rajya Sabha in the elections held on March 27, 2002.

Admitting the petition filed by D.K. Tara Devi Siddhartha, the defeated BJP candidate, Justice H. Rangavittalachar on Thursday ordered issuance of notice to Vijay Mallya, Janardhan Poojary, Prema Cariappa and M.V. Rajashekhara Murthy and the other elected candidates.

The petitioner contended that Mallya had various business interests in India and abroad and rarely stayed in the city. ``Even so he had claimed to be an elector of Karnataka, he was not eligible to contest the election and hold office as a member of Rajya Sabha.

``The returning officer had overruled the objections of the petitioner filled at the time of the scrutiny of the nomination paper. This was illegal and the election of the respondent was invalid,'''' the petitioner added.

The petitioner sought for a declaration setting aside the election of the respondent and declaring her as having been duly elected to Rajya Sabha.

In the election held, there were five candidates including the petitioner. Mallya secured 46 votes while the petitioner got 34 votes.
