0,HC notices to state govts in quake rehab case,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court on Thursday issued notices to the state government, Maharashtra government, Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority and others following a special civil application alleging irregularities in allotment of residential units in quake-ravaged Adhoi village of Kutch district, which was adopted and rebuilt by Maharashtra government.

A Division Bench of Acting Chief Justice J N Bhatt and Justice A L Dave directed the respondents to file their replies by July 1, the next date for hearing.

Petitioners Pravin Gala and Atul Gindra, natives of Adhoi village, contended that two survey reports were made by the officials of the state government for the construction of residential units and rehabilitation of quake-affected persons.

The petitioners'' advocate, B M Mangukiya, alleged that in the first survey, 1360 beneficiaries were identified. In the second survey done, nearly 450 names were added, out of which 400 were not the actual persons who were affected by the quake.

The Division Bench, in an interim order, ruled that allotment of residential units to persons, who are not enlisted commonly in both survey reports and whose names have been included in the second survey, will be made subject to the court''s further orders.

1,Police official yet to be arrested in corruption case,"MUMBAI: Although the anticorruption bureau has accused assistant police commissioner (enforcement) J.S. Sodhi of demanding Rs 10 lakhs from the owner of J49 disco in Juhu, the police officer has not been arrested so far.

Two of his subordinates, senior inspector Shanker Mahadik and inspector Narendra Singh, have already been arrested for allegedly accepting Rs 1.5 lakhs from Dhananjay Shetty, the owner of the disco.

They have been remanded to police custody until June 21. Deputy police commissioner (enforcement) Pradnya Sarvade told TNN on Thursday that she has asked police commissioner R.S. Sharma to suspend the two officers.

ACB sources said there was â€œstrongâ€™â€™ evidence to implicate Mr Sodhi in the case. But it is not clear why he had not been arrested until late Thursday evening. Mr Sodhi was back at work on Thursday.

When contacted, Mr Sodhi denied the allegations. â€œI had raided Hotel Juhu Residency, situated above J49 disco, on June 9 and arrested six commercial sex workers. Mr

Shetty was upset about the raid and has, therefore,made baseless allegations against me,â€™â€™ he said. Asked about his subordinates being arrested for collecting Rs 1.5 lakhs from Mr Shetty, he said, â€œI was also shocked to learn about the arrests. But I am not linked to the case.â€™â€™

Commenting on the ACB naming him in the FIR, he said, â€œThe FIR is based on the complaint lodged by Mr Shetty.â€™â€™ Mr Sodhi has no reply when asked why Mr Shetty had not levelled any allegations against DCP Sarvade, who had supervised the raid along with him.

Mr Shetty said that he had been named an absconder after the raid even though he had been in touch with officers of the social service branch. Mr Sodhi still maintains that Mr Shetty was â€œnot traceableâ€™â€™.

2,Where's the money BJP govt promised?,"AHMEDABAD: Just before the Gujarat Assembly elections last December, the ruling BJP brought out an election manifesto stating that it would make ""arrangements to repay, within 180 days, deposits of up to Rs 1 lakh under the deposit insurance cover to depositors of the closed urban cooperative banks"".

It is now six months, or 180 days since the party came to power, but there is no sign of the depositors getting their money back. Instead, the BJP government is blaming the RBI for the delay.

The BJP, which had called itself as the ''Interest Saviour of Five Crore Gujaratis'' in its manifesto, has failed miserably in protecting investors.

In fact, cooperative bank scams which have unfolded in the last six months have shown the direct involvement of several BJP leaders, including a minister and a Member of Parliament.

Gujarat''s minister for cooperatives, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, says the government has proposed the liquidation of the three largest UCBs â€” Visnagar, Charotar and Diamond Jubilee banks â€” which have collapsed. Together, these banks had deposits exceeding Rs 800 crore.

""But, the decision now rests with the RBI which has to approve our liquidation proposal. Liquidation of four banks, involving deposits of Rs 85 crore, has been announced recently. It cannot be said that we have not fulfilled our election promise,"" he added.

Whether the RBI is to be blamed or not is another matter. But, the fact remains that lakhs of depositors have not got back their money, as was promised by the BJP.

RBI''s regional director in Gujarat, Vani Sharma, said that the liquidation proposals for the three large UCBs have been sent to the Mumbai office and clearance is awaited. When contacted by TNN, the RBI spokesperson at Mumbai said that she was not in a position to comment.

The president of the All-Gujarat Cooperative Banks Depositors Account Holders Association, Prakash Gujar, claimed that senior RBI officials in Mumbai had told him that they are reluctant to allow the liquidation of these three banks.

""RBI''s subsidiary â€” the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation â€” has been set up to give insurance support to all commercial banks and UCBs in India, not just in Gujarat. In this state, some people set up banks and indulged in fraud which lead to the closure of banks. Now, the state wants the RBI to refund deposits and thus rescue the scamsters,"" is the gist of what RBI officials have reportedly told Gujar.

But Chudasama seems to have forgotten about the 15 to 20 other banks which have closed in the past couple of years.

An amount of nearly Rs 1,000 crore, which is entitled as refund through DICGC, is blocked as deposits in Suryapur, Sabarmati, Janta, Cooperative Bank of Ahmedabad and United Mercantile banks, just to name a few.

Also what about those depositors whose amounts exceed Rs 1 lakh and are thus not insured under the DICGC?

That, according to banking sources, could add up to another Rs 500 crore which may be as good as gone.

3,DC seeks report from SSP for allowing Maya rally,"JALANDHAR: The deputy commissioner has sought report from the district police chief to decide on giving permission to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati for addressing rally on July 7 at Buta Mandi area, where recently violence broke out after caste clashes in Talhan and one person was allegedly killed in police firing.

â€˜â€˜As curfew was recently lifted from the Buta Mandi area, where violence occurred after caste clashes in Talhan village, on the issue of giving permission to Mayawati to hold rally in the area, I have asked SSP Harpreet Singh Sidhu to submit his report,â€™â€™ deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Gupta said here. He added that if there was any threat to the peace in the area, the UP chief minister may be denied permission for the rally.

Meanwhile, Narender Kashyap, incharge of BSPâ€™s affairs in Punjab, claimed on Thursday during his press conference that the party had got permission from the district administration for holding rally in Buta Mandi area. When pointed out that the partyâ€™s rally at Buta Mandi may disturb the peace restored in the area after 10 days of continuous curfew,Kashyap ruled it out and said that the BSP would raise issues of Dalits. Moreover, a no-objection certificate had already been taken from the district administration for the proposed rally, he added.

On the peace agreement achieved in Talhan village, where caste clashes ignited on June 5, Kashyap said although the issue had been resolved in Talhan, social boycott was continuing in as many as 15 villages of the state.

â€˜â€˜Although amicable solution has been achieved between the two communities, other demands were pending and we will again raise our demands in the July 7 rally,â€™â€™ he added. During the rally, Mayawati will disclose the partyâ€™s strategy to be adopted for the forthcoming parliamentary election, Kashyap said adding that the party president Kanshi Ram would not attend the rally as he was busy in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi where assembly elections would be held soon.

State president Avtar Singh Karimpuri, general secretary Pawan Kumar Tinu and other party leaders were also present.

4,Hike by PGI: IMA asks MC for separate incinerator,"CHANDIGARH: The disposal of biomedical waste has come under scanner with the private nursing homes here coming down heavily on the 140 per cent hike in incineration charges effected by PGI in two years.

To help the diagnostic centres, institutional clinics and private nursing homes tide over the crisis, the Chandigarh chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has recently met the mayor and urged him to facilitate setting up a separate incinerator at the earliest. The issue has been brought to the notice of adviser to UT administrator Virendra Singh.

Speaking to Times News Network, IMA Chandigarh chapter secretary Dr Neeraj Nagpal said with PGI hiking the incineration charges from Rs 10 per kilogram of biomedical waste about two years back to Rs 24 per kilogram at present, private nursing homes in the city are being virtually made to pay through the nose.

â€œWe are helpless. Since we have to depend on the PGI for disposal of the biomedical waste generated in our hospitals, we are left with no option but to pay whatever is asked from us.

Since the 140 per cent raise in incineration charges is making things extremely difficult for us, we have approached the MC requesting them either to run an incinerator which all the private nursing homes would use or allot us land for setting up the same which would be run on a noprofit-no-loss basis,â€� he says.

An official of a noted private hospital in Sector 34 says that if the issue is not resolved soon, the situation might go out of hand. â€œThe authorities are somehow not concerned. We had met the MC officials a few months back but there has been no response. Taking cue from PGI, the agency transporting the biomedical waste to the incinerator from the nursing homes has also hiked the rates. The problem can be avoided if the private nursing homes are given a separate space for waste incineration,â€� he says.

Dubbing Mayor Subhash Chawlaâ€™s response to their proposal as â€œpositiveâ€� Dr Nagpal says, â€œDisposal of biomedical waste is MCâ€™s responsibility.

We have requested the mayor to create facility for incineration.We have also given the option that in case MC is unable to do it on its own, about 500 square yard of space be allotted to us for setting up the incinerator.

Either we can run it on our own or a service provider can run it on a break even basis. We had met the MC commissioner in this regard but there was no response. We are hopeful of a positive outcome this time.â€�

6,Plan to focus on voluntary sector policy,"NEW DELHI: The Planning Commission hopes to have, within two months, a national policy on the voluntary sector and perhaps make specific 10th Plan targets the nucleus of an action programme.

Planning Commission chief K C Pant announced this on Wednesday after the ""joint machinery"" comprising representatives from the voluntary sector and officials met for the first time after its reconstitution in January this year.

On this panel, chaired by Pant, are voluntary sector veterans such as Ela Bhatt, Mohan Dharia and Chandi Prasad Bhatt as well as the director-general of CAPART and the secretaries of various ministries.

Pant said states will have to be on board and even problems at the district level may have to be taken into account since many agencies work at the village or district level. One point made was though problems are growing in cities, the voluntary movement isn''t as strong there.

7,NCP activists stage demonstration at Jedhe college,"PUNE: Activists of the Nationalist Congress Partyâ€™s (NCP) studentsâ€™ wing staged a demonstration on Thursday morning at the Shivaji Maratha Societyâ€™s Appaseheb Jedhe college, disrupting the ongoing admission process for degree courses being held in the college.

The NCP activists, led by studentsâ€™ wing president Pradeep Deshmukh, were protesting against the collection of unaccounted fee from students seeking admission to undergraduate courses in arts and commerce.

They alleged that the college was collecting a sum of Rs 500 towards building funds from every student without issuing a receipt.

Speaking to reporters later, Deshmukh said collecting money in such a fashion was illegal. â€œThe students were just made to sign a register saying that they had voluntarily paid the money to the college fund,â€� he said.

The college management, including principal M.N. Kamble, later gave an assurance that no extra money would be collected from the students.

Deshmukh also warned other educational institutions in the city against â€œfleecingâ€� students, and said strict action would be initiated against the guilty.

Meanwhile, about 200 members of the Studentsâ€™ Federation of India (SFI) held a day-long demonstration in front of the Maharashtra Association of Professional Educational Institutionsâ€™ (Mapei) office at the Maharashtra Institute of Technology here.

They were protesting against the three-tier fee structure proposed by Mapei.

However, SFI members alleged that the college authorities did not allow them to meet Mapei secretary Vishawanth Karad throughout the day, despite the fact that he had been informed of the protest three days in advance.

8,NHRC hauls up UP govt on illegal detention,"NEW DELHI: For the first time, the NHRC Thursday invoked powers of a civil court and asked the UP chief secretary to appear before the commission on July 28 in an illegal detention case of one Lal Chandra.

The NHRC has been vested with powers of a civil court under section 13 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.

According to the complaint by Chandra, he was illegally detained on a false charge of several offences, including murder, in Sant Kabir Nagar district in 1999 and kept till March 2000. He was later released when it was found that the man he was accused of having allegedly murdered was alive.

The NHRC decided that those responsible for Chandra''s illegal detention and false prosecution were liable to be proceeded against in accordance with law as well as pay compensation to the victim.

The police report sent to the NHRC revealed that no thorough investigation had been conducted which led to Chandra going to jail. Two sub-inspectors were suspended and the investigation officer said that the two can be prosecuted. However, due to lack of sanction for prosecution, the matter was closed and submitted to the court which accepted it.

The NHRC then asked for the relevant documents, including the order refusing to sanction prosecution, the final report submitted to the court and the order of the court accepting the final report.

9,"Come clear on Ayodhya, Togadia tells NDA govt","AJMER: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Thursday asked the NDA government to come out clearly how it proposed to resolve the Ayodhya issue and avoid ""underhand dealings"".

""The government should come out with a clear policy on Ayodhya instead of indulging in underhand dealings"" VHP''s international general secretary Pravin Togadia told reporters here.

Expressing his unhappiness with the BJP''s handling of the Ayodhya issue since coming to power at the Centre, he said, ""BJP should not take Hindus for granted"".

""The Hindus"", he said, ""would not tolerate bending of knees by any one for electoral benefits"". Togadia also accused the Centre of ""wooing"" Pakistan even after its President Pervez Musharraf failed to rule out a second Kargil.

Asked if he would address election meetings in Rajasthan as he had done in Gujarat, Togadia said he was yet to decide about it.

Earlier, he appeared before Ajmer additional chief judicial magistrate Indu Pareek on Thursday in connection with criminal cases registered against him by the Rajasthan police for conducting ""trishul deeksha"" here on April 13.

He will again appear on July 24. The chargesheet could not be filed on Thursday as investigating officer Anil Tak filed an application seeking 45 days for collecting evidence.

Meanwhile, Togadia''s counsel O S Lakhawat filed an application and alleged that the investigating agency were buying time to frame false charges against Togadia under the directions of the state government.

Later speaking to newspersons Togadia reiterated that the VHP would support the party which favours Hindutva. He said that it is unfortunate that in a democratic country like India, interests of the majority community are being overlooked.

Asked whether the VHP had lost faith in the BJP, Togadia said that although the BJP had not betrayed the VHP, they seem to be losing the confidence of the people regarding the Ram temple issue.

Earlier addressing meetings in Bari Sadri and Kankroli in Rajsamand district on Wednesday night, Togadia said people will give a ""befitting reply"" to Gehlot government for banning ""trishul deeskha"" as the move was aimed at pleasing Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

He alleged that the Gehlot government registered criminal charges against him because he demanded death sentence for Pakistani terrorists in his Ajmer speech. He said the VHP will launch a door-to-door campaign to bring to bear public pressure on members of Parliament to enact a legislation paving the way for construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

13,Poor farmers selling land for a song,"DHARWAD: The distress sale of agricultural tracts in Hyderabad-Karnatak districts is still continuing, albeit clandestinely, despite the government''s ordinance placing restrictions on sale or lease of land.

Poor farmers are being forced to sell land to climb out of the depths of misery they are in, thanks to failed monsoon and wrong crop pattern. Thousands of acres of land were sold before the ordinance was promulgated, and even now such cases are reported, but only from certain pockets.

Recently, the government promulgated the ordinance placing restrictions on farmers from selling or leasing irrigated land in command areas without the irrigation department''s nod.

Almatti and Narayanapura dams constructed under the Upper Krishna Project (UKP), have helped farmers irrigate 509,000 hectares of land in Gulbarga, Bijapur and Raichur districts. The UKP II and III phases are to irrigate another 5 lakh hectares.

This ambitious project notwithstanding, farmers, from Gulbarga district''s Shahpur and Surpur in particular, have been selling land in panic for a sum as paltry as Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000 an acre against Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh evaluated by the sub-registrar.

Some months ago, the government set up a team headed by S.A. Patil, vice-chancellor of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, to look into farmers'' problems and submit a report. He said: ""We may take a month.""

Patil said landlords from Andhra Pradesh have been buying out large tracts from poor farmers in Karnataka. The Andhra farmers who bought land in Karnataka opted for paddy crop against the conventional maize, which was followed by their Karnataka brethren too.

Cultivating paddy calls for huge amounts of water and a rich expertise in growing that crop. The Karnataka farmers lacked both, triggering a wave of panic sale.

14,Tough wedding record law soon,"KOLKATA: All those who fail to record their marriages within three months of tying the knot before a pundit or a kazi, will landin prisons for three months. They will also have to pay a fee to the recording authority to get the marriage registered.

The West Bengal government will place a bill to this effect making the recording of marriage compulsory.

According to government sources, the move is primarily to ensure payment of maintenance to women in cases of divorce. â€œ There are many cases where men often deny marriage to avoid payment of maintenance.

Since the marriage itself is challenged, courts cannot order provisional maintenance. We want to plug the loopholes now,â€™â€™ said an official.

The tendency to deny the marriage became more rampant after the ceiling on the maintenance amount was abolished, following an amendment to the CrPC both by the state and the Centre.

Estranged wives or their families often try to present the priest or kazi who solemnise the marriages, but the whole exercise became messy.

The officials pointed out that the registration of marriage with the government approved marriage registers had not been made compulsory so far in view of the socio-economic reality.

However, all communities had their marriage acts which blended traditional practices with legal framework.

The new bill would allow recording of the marital status and name of spouses with the government designated officers at block level as well as gram panchayat officials. Muslim marriages could be recorded with the kaziâ€™s office which was already the prevailing practise.

15,"Kidney racket busted, 13 arrested","HYDERABAD: Police on Thursday busted a major kidney racket run by a gang of touts and arrested 13 persons who lured poor people from different parts of the state into selling their kidneys to patients waiting for transplants in corporate hospitals.

The managements of these hospitals were aware of the racket, additional commissioner of police A K Khan told reporters here. He said two

doctors working at a hospital located at Lower Tank Bund have been identified as having links with the gang.

Investigators have also found links to at least five hospitals in the city and the patientsâ€™ files will be sent to the authorisation committee which gives permission for organ transplantation, the additional commissioner said.

A report from the committee is awaited so that action can be taken against the erring doctors, he said.

About 51 cases of buying and selling of kidneys by the gang â€” which has been operating for the past two years â€” have been identified, the police officer said. However, Vasu, the kingpin who was produced before the media, said he and his gang members have been in the business for over three years.

Explaining the modus operandi behind the racket, Khan said the gang members looked for donors, often poor people, offering them big money.

They then scouted for patients in corporate hospitals. A meeting between the donors and the patientsâ€™ relatives followed and a price agreed upon. The brokers took commissions ranging between Rs 10,000 and Rs 50,000.

The brokers also arranged fake certificates to either show that the donors were residents of Hyderabad or relatives of the patients. These were necessary to get the authorisation committeeâ€™s clearance, Khan said.

The arrested persons also pointed to the complicity of some government officials who took money to issue fake residential and other certificates. These charges will be probed, the senior police official said.

The arrests were made by the North Zone Task Force team. The 13 persons arrested included six members of the gang â€” A Vasu, S Narasimha Rao, M Raju, T Pitchaiah, K Srinivas and I Jayaram Reddy, and seven donors â€” G Venu of Guntur, C Raghu of East Godavari, K Ramana of Khammam, PVS Rama Raju of West Godavari, K Ratnakar of Hyderabad, B Subbu of Bellary in Karnataka and B Vasudeva Charyulu of Nalgonda.

Additional deputy commissioner of police, task force N Shiva Shanker Reddy was present at the press conference.

17,AIPWA meet criticises NDA govt,"DHANBAD: CPI-ML leaders came down heavily on the NDA government for its anti-women and anti-labour policies at the three-day national conference of AIPWA which began here at the local Bablu Dharamshala on Wednesday.

The conference will discuss and come out with a view on, ""Rural and Urban Women in India- Issues and Challenges"".

Inaugurating the conference, AICCTU general secretary Swapan Mukherjee alleged that the present government has done nothing to look after the interests of the working class, downtrodden sections and women. Economic sovereignty of the country is at stake because of the anti-labour policies of the government, he alleged.

He blamed both the government as well as the opposition parties for the stalemate over the women reservation Bill and alleged that it is because of the feudalistic attitude of the politicians that the Bill could not be passed in Parliament.

While addressing the gathering, CPI-ML legislative party leader Mahendra Singh said that it is because of the globalisation policy of the government that 60 per cent of the population is still living below the poverty line and only capitalists and industrialists are being benefited.

AIPWA president Kumudini Pati and Mukta Manohar from Maharashtra said that the laws framed to protect women in society are not very effective and they are never implemented properly.

AIPWA general secretary Srilata Swaminathan was also present on the occasion.

18,"CPM, Front differ on minister's role","KOLKATA: The CPM and the Left Front have different views on how West Bengal health minister Surjya Kanta Misra is tackling the deaths of children from an unknown disease in Murshidabad.

While CPM state secretary Anil Biswas finds no fault with Misra, Left Front chairman Biman Bose feels that he should have visited Murshidabad.

Prominent Left Front partners agreed with Bose and criticise Misra.

Questions were raised even earlier about Misraâ€™s sensitivities. Even when several children died at B.C. Roy hospital in Kolkata last year, the health minister had initially refused to visit the hospital but later succumbed to pressure after the chief minister decided to pay a visit.

Even now, when the CM decided to visit Murshidabad, the minister was busy in party programmes. He went to Tripura, followed by a visit to Midnapore to campaign for Left candidates in the ensuing civic polls.

An angry Misra shooed the media away at Writersâ€™ Buildings on Thursday. Asked what prevented him from visiting Murshidabad, Misra said, â€œLet the CM return first. I will talk to him and go if necessary,â€� he said.

â€œThe party did not send Misra to Murshidabad. The CM wanted to go and the party agreed. Do not read anything more into it,â€� said CPM state secretary Anil Biswas.

Agreeing that Misra had been â€œstuckâ€� in party work in Tripura and Midnapore, Bose, however, felt that as health minister â€œSurjya should have cut short his party programme, visited the villages and collected information.

Buddha has gone there do to this. I will talk to Surjya tomorrow,â€� Bose said.

19,Security man arrested for robbing firm he was 'guarding',"HYDERABAD: A security guard was arrested by the Ramgopalpet police on Thursday on charges of robbing a private company, which he was supposed to be guarding, on May 28. The security guard, K Dayakar and his associate, K Sailu were arrested and Rs 2.82 lakh in cash, 35 grams of gold, a cell phone and a television were recovered from their possession.

Dayakar was working as security guard at Autofin Limited at Paradise junction in Secunderabad and had access to the accounts department where the daily cash collections were stored. Dayakar hatched a plan to steal the cash box and sought the help of his friend Sailu to implement his plan.

As Dayakar had keys to access all the rooms in the building, he could easily enter the accounts department and get away with the cash box containing Rs 4,35,214. Following a complaint registered by the company, police kept the security staff, mechanics and drivers of the company under surveillance.

The police grew suspicious when they found Dayakar was spending money lavishly and conducted a raid of his residence in Shapoornagar, following which he was arrested.

20,Report asks govt to help Gopalamitras,"HYDERABAD: The state governmentâ€™s efforts to improve rural economy by increasing productivity of farm animals through artificial insemination programme or, the Gopalamitra scheme, has run into rough weather in Telangana.

According to a status report on bovine breeding activities prepared by the Andhra Pradesh Livestock Development Agency (APLDA), submitted to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the government had taken up a massive programme of restructuring cattle breeding operations in the state under the National Project for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding with financial assistance from the Centre in 2000. But certain constraints cropped up while implementing the scheme in Telangana.

The report says â€˜Gopalamitrasâ€™ (private artificial insemination experts) were unable to sustain themselves in the region due to lack of awareness among farmers. Another problem faced by the Gopalamitras was lack of availability of good quality animals. This resulted in the practitioners opting out of the scheme.

The report suggests that Gopalamitras be given some financial assistance as sustenance allowance and incentives for their livelihood. If the state government accepts this proposal, then it would have to make financial allocation from its budget as no central assistance would be given for sustenance of Gopalamitras.

There are 6,649 artificial insemination centres in the state.

The report, however, says the artificial insemination programme was successful in Ongole, where preservation of Ongole bulls (also known as Veera), has been taken up on a large scale.

The Ongole bulls selected from the breeding tract are being used for inseminating Ongole-type animals in 11 districts of the state, the report adds.

Of the total 90,000 applications that the college has received, around 1,300 are incomplete. To give the applicants a fair chance, the college is getting in touch with the students to get the â€˜â€˜missed outâ€™â€™ details. â€˜â€˜We are calling up or e-mailing students who have left their forms incomplete or filled them wrongly,â€™â€™ said principal Bhim Sen Singh.

The effort takes time and manpower, but the college is all ready to put in what it takes.

With the cut-off deadline four days away, most colleges are letting specialised software do the job of sorting out applications. Kirori Mal sorted out its huge bundle of 90,000 forms by Wednesday evening. â€˜â€˜We have specialised software which takes into account the different riders for different subjects. This makes the sorting easier and faster,â€™â€™ Seema Parihar, incharge of the college Internet section said.

Venkateswara will complete its sorting by Saturday. But here too, incomplete forms remain a concern. â€˜â€˜More than 10 per cent of the forms are incomplete,â€� principal A S Reddy said.

For instance, for a subject like Economics (Honours), Venkateswara considers marks for English, Economics, Maths and one relevant subject. â€˜â€˜We cannot consider forms where students have filled in subjects like art and physical education. Moreover, many students have filled in wrong subject combinations,â€™â€™ added Reddy.

22,Punjab CM wary about Maya addressing rally,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday said that he planned to write to his Uttar Pradesh counterpart, Mayawati, not to come to Punjab and address a rally in Talhan on July 7.

23,Setback to UP govt's drive to fill up jobs,"LUCKNOW: The Mayawati government''s drive to fill up the backlog in government departments may receive a setback as a Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court has issued notice to the government on a PIL filed by a former bureaucrat.

Petitioner, S N Shukla, has contended in the PIL (3039/2003) that the current mass recruitment drive was not only against the interest of the state and its people but discriminatory against both reserved and general category candidates.

He has pointed out that in the current drive, dependents of deceased SC/ST/OBC employees had been debarred in gross violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Thousands of daily/contractual/temporary workers were also being kept out of it, said the petitioner.

While SC/ST candidates were being given concessions and relaxation in eligibility norms and promotions in direct recruitment, the OBCs were being denied the same, argued the petitioner.

The petitioner has also pointed out that the vacancies of the current year and even next year are being created this year only and are being given to reserved categories without adhering to the Supreme Court directive of 50 per cent maximum reservation.

Moreover, all these posts were being created without legislative approval in violation of Article 205 of the Constitution, budget manual and financial rules. ""The government has taken only vote on account from which no new expenditure can be met,"" he has argued.

After hearing the arguments, Justice N K Mehrotra issued notice to the Mayawati government giving two weeks'' time to file the counter-affidavit and one week to the petitioner for filing rejoinder. The case would be listed in the third week of July.

Although no interim relief was granted by the court, the PIL assumes significance as fate of Mayawati''s recruitment spree would be subject to final disposal of the petition.

Currently, the drive is in full throttle and the chief secretary had held a high-level meeting on Wednesday to review the remaining backlog. Directions have been issued to all departments to fulfil the quota before Chief Minister Mayawati holds another meeting on June 20.

24,Ayodhya row: Muslim law board may draft proposal,"LUCKNOW: Endless wait in receiving Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati''s proposal seems to have tired the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) so much that it is now thinking of drafting its own formula for an amicable solution to Ayodhya imbroglio.

Board''s spokesperson Maulana Sajjad Nomani on Thursday said that ""for a peaceful co-existence and confidence-building, the AIMPLB may also suggest and draft a proposal to solve the Ayodhya dispute in near future.""

Significantly, the Board''s changing face came only a day after dropping Kanchi seer''s proposal from the crucial June 21 meeting of Board''s sub-committee on Babri in New Delhi.

Maulana Nomani said that Muslims were neither rigid nor adamant and look at the dispute with broader perspective. ""There is always a scope for a compromise. Rules can be amended without hurting religious feelings and sentiments of each other. Islamic jurisprudence too supports dialogue and there is no harm in exploring such possibilities,"" he commented.

He, however, hastened to add that the Board did not have any such plan in near future to offer any formula without taking the community members and leaders into confidence.

Taking a cue from the past experience, Maulana Nomani pointed out that talks were initiated in right earnest but it failed to reach any logical conclusion as the other party backed out when it came to a written agreement.

Maulana Nomani made it clear that the Board would not give in to any barter or bargain by the Centre or any other contesting party on the issue. ""We would go by Sharia or court. If it is established through the court that a temple existed there we would give up our claim from the site,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Board vice-chairman Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, who was in Ayodhya on Thursday to participate in a seminar organised by Qaumi Aman Committee, said that there were only three approaches to solve the tangle - legal, religious and historical.

""Any of these solutions are possible only by keeping the political leaders out,"" he pointed.

25,Centre asks UP govt to stop work near Taj,"NEW DELHI: Alarmed by reports of continuing construction on the banks of the Yamuna River behind the Taj Mahal, Union Minister for Culture and Tourism Jagmohan has asked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati to immediately stop all work around the protected monument and initiate a probe into how clearance was given for such a project.

The minister, who will visit the Taj on Sunday, wrote a second letter to Mayawati three days after his first, warning her that the construction was clear violation of the law. This letter, less gentle than the first, came after a meeting the minister held with several senior officers at both the Central and state level.

Interestingly, the UP government''s ambitious Rs 175-crore project to build a shopping plaza very close to the world heritage envisaged a fifty per cent funding from the Centre, but at no point has any department of the Centre been consulted or informed, government sources said.

Jagmohan pointed out in his letter that no clearance had been taken from the Centre under the Environment Protection Act. ""The fact that UNESCO has declared Taj and Agra Fort as ''World Heritage Sites'', which requires a certain ambience to be kept, has been ignored. Nor has the ministry of culture, which is concerned with such sites and also with the implementation of Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, been consulted,"" the letter said.

Though Mayawati herself is yet to respond to Jagmohan''s first letter written on June 16, ministry sources said the UP chief secretary had called the minister on telephone to assure him that work was being stopped immediately.

However, media reports said work was continuing at the site prompting the minister to write to Mayawati again.

Officials of the National Projects Construction Corporation (NPCC) present at Friday''s meeting explained that the only work on now was the building of a temporary clay embankment being built in view of the rains, but Jagmohan said all worked, including that on the embankment should stop forthwith.

The minister''s letter drew attention to a recent Supreme Court order that even work on the temporary embankment should be subject to directions and clearance from the Centre.

Among those at the meeting were secretary, culture, director general ASI Gauri Chatterjee, other senior Central government officials.

From the state, the Agra Division Commissioner and vice-chairman Agra Development Authority accompanied the UP Environment Secretary, V K Gupta, who has just been appointed in the wake of the Taj controversy.

Jagmohan''s latest move puts the ball squarely in Mayawati''s court, with the world watching intently. International organisations like UNESCO have already expressed their concern.

The local ASI has already lodged an FIR with the police for violation of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.
