0,HC dismisses writ against election rules,"LUCKNOW: A division bench of the Allahabad High Court, comprising Chief Justice Tarun Chatterjee and Justice Rakesh Sharma, on Tuesday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the amendment in the conduct of election rules prescribing two sets of nomination forms for candidates belonging to political parties and that of independent candidates.

The petition was filed by the president of the Social Action for People''s Right, Maj SN Tripathi. It was urged that for candidate belonging to political parties only one proposer and seconder were needed, whereas ten proposers were needed for independent candidates which was discriminatory.

It was urged that the political ""parties cannot have any role in the election. It is only an individual who can fight the election so the nomination form for both should be same"".

On the contrary, senior advocate Ashok Nigam, appearing on behalf of the Election Commission, said that ""parliamentary democracy can run without the existence of political parties and our Constitution has also recognised the role of political parties by introducing the 10th Schedule.

Hence, it is incorrect to say that political parties can not put up candidates"".

1,'No simultaneous polls in UP',"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday gave ample indication that he was not in a hurry to hold assembly poll along with that of Lok Sabha when he announced that the state assembly would have its month-long budget session from February 4 next.

""Unlike the NDA-led Centre, we will not have a vote on account and pass the state budget for 2004-05 before the end of the current financial year,"" the chief minister asserted.

But then he clarified that this did not mean that he was not prepared to meet the challenge posed by the BJP, which he dubbed as ""fascist"" and enemy number one.

The BJP, he said, had become overconfident after its victory in recent assembly elections in three states. Its myth would be broken once it faced elections in UP, he added.

Talkinmg to newspersons here, Yadav said that it was wrong to say that he had forged some tacit understanding with the BJP.

It was only a figment of imagination, he said, adding that:""Secularism is my forte and it is for everyone to see that I am honest in fighting against the BJP and putting break on its victory march in UP.""

""I can not depart with my politics of socialism and join hands with the BJP,'''' Yadav said, blaming his adversaries for creating wrong impression. He , however, said that he was not against Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, but against BJP''s policies of divide and rule.

As for his understanding with the Congress, Yadav said : ""My eyes and ears are open and Congress'' overtures with the BSP are worth noticing."" Elaborating ,he said he would talk to Congress president Soniaji on this count. The BSP, he said, had now become epitome of corruption and opportunism and one should think the goal of strengthening secularism before joining hands with it.

On the issue of prime ministerial candidate, he said his party would decide on it only after the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls. When asked about the candidature of Sonia Gandhi, he refused to comment saying that there was still time to think about it.

When asked about his prospects he said: "" I am not in the race."" He, however, disclosed that it was a different story that at one point of time his candidature had been supported by Surjeet Singh and Jyoti Basu of CPM and other parties, including the Congress in the Lok Sabha, barring Laloo Prasad Yadav and Sharad Yadav, who opposed him tooth and nail.

2,Battle lines drawn for LS elections,"MUKTSAR: Itâ€™s the election season again. And both the major parities in Punjab - the Akalis and the Congress - have got the battlelines drawn.

While the Akalis have started digging out Congress partyâ€™s alleged anti-Sikh history to whip up religious sentiments against the Congress, the latter has the poll plank of the alleged involvement of Akalis in corruption and misusing the panth for their narrow political ends in cahoots with the BJP.

Almost all the SAD leaders who addressed the partyâ€™s conference organised here on Maghi Mela on Tuesday accused the Nehru-Gandhi family of discriminating against the Sikhs.

Starting from the injustice meted out to Punjab over Punjabi Suba issue, Operation Blue Star, Massacre of the Sikhs in 1984, Parkash Singh Badal counted on many such emotional issues to hit the Congress hard.

The credentials of Amarinderâ€™s forefathers were also questioned by digging up their history. Manpreet Badal attacked CMâ€™s forefathers for helping Ahmed Shah Abdali in his campaign against the Sikhs, supporting British empire during the first war of Independence in 1857 and banning Akali jathas during Gurdwara liberation movement.

On the other hand, Amarinder and Jagmeet fired salvos on Badal family for their alleged indulgence in corruption and politicising Sikh religion. They accused Badals of making the area drug-addicted by patronising the drugs business.

The Akalis again threw the bait of freebies â€” power and water â€” to lure rural voters on Tuesday. Congress however adhered on charging these services but assured uninterrupted supply.

The shagun schemes, pensions and other sundry benefits to the weaker sections and abolition of octroi and the Exim forms were among the sops offered to the urbanites by both the parties.

While Sonia versus Vajpayee, or Swadeshi versus Videshi, seemed to be the major poll plank for Akali-BJP alliance in the coming elections, Congress leaders expressed apprehension of dividing the country on communal lines if BJP was voted to power. If Akali-BJP combine sought to cash in on the feel-good factor of improving relations with Pakistan, Congress leaders accused Vajpayee of playing into the hands of big powers.

While innocent people were being killed by Pakabetted terrorists, Vajpayee is implementing a ceasefire and embracing Musharraf, said Jagmeet.

3,Simultaneous polls possible: Bhajan,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana Congress president and former chief minister Bhajan Lal, said, on Tuesday, that there was every possibility that the Chautala government would recommend holding of the assembly elections in the state along with the Lok Sabha polls.

Bhajan Lal, who was talking to media persons after the installation of Sumeeta Singh as the president of the Haryana Pradesh Mahila Congress in place of Anita Yadav, Bhajan Lal said the Congress was fully prepared to fight both the elections and the masses wanted to get rid of the Chautala regime at the earliest.

Ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) president and chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, however, categorically stated in Ambala on Monday that there was no move to hold Assembly elections in the state simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls. He said that his government would complete its full tenure and the assembly elections would be held as per the scheduled date, i.e. February-March, 2005.

In reply to a question, Bhajan Lal expressed confidence that if the mood of the people was an indication, the Congress would win all the 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state and at least 70 out of a total of 90 assembly seats.

Asked if any date has been fixed for Sonia Gandhiâ€™s visit to Haryana, Bhajan Lal said she might address a rally at Hisar in February or March, but no programme had so far been finalised for her visit. He stressed that the masses in the country would give a befitting rebuff to the BJP this time for raking up time and again Sonia Gandhiâ€™s foreign origin.

Later, talking to media persons, Sumeeta Singh said that her first task was to strengthen the hands of Sonia Gandhi and Bhajan Lal by mobilising womenâ€™s support for the Congress in the state so as to enable the party to make a clean sweep in the coming elections.

She said she had already urged HPCC chief to allot at least 33 per cent of Lok Sabha and assembly seats to women candidates in the coming elections. Asked if the party had so many winning women candidates, she said women in Haryana were very enterprising and, given a chance, they would prove their worth. She said that the Mahila Congress would organise a state-level rally at Bhiwani on January 24 which would be addressed, among others, by all-India Mahila Congress president Reeta Bahuguna.

About rampant factionalism in the state Congress, Reeta Singh said there was no dissidence or factionalism in the party, only ""difference of opinion which was a natural phenomenon in a democratic set-up.""

The party, she said, was fully united under the leadership of Bhajan Lal.

4,State BJP well into election mode,"AHMEDABAD: Although the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has only recently announced its ''entry into the election mode'', it has already completed its first round of mass-contact programme.

With the five-day Siddhi yatras and the recently-concluded Vijay Vikas yatras which lasted for two weeks, the BJP MLAs and MPs were found more than busy apprising its prospective voters of its achievements in the state and that of the Vajpayee government at the centre.

In fact, the party has started organising zonal convention of its workers during which they plan to collect contributions from their supporters along with other wellwishers of the saffron brigade.

A senior BJP leader said, ""An ''Aajivan Sahyog Nidhi'' drive had already commenced in the districts from Sunday and would continue for one whole month. This regular annual exercise of funds-collection helps the central leadership for party activities in the country,"" State BJP vice-president Anant Dave has been made in-charge of this drive which has been undertaken in January every year since 1998.

Meanwhile, state BJP general secretary Jayantilal Barot who returned from tour of Patan Lok Sabha constituency said that active campaigning for Lok Sabha polls would begin only after the poll schedule was finalised by the central leadership.

Also, the party''s MPs, after addressing various meetings, have also taken up the pending projects in their constituencies with the concerned authorities at district with the district collectors. They are following the issue with senior secretaries in Gandhinagar.

5,Five gangsters arrested,"PATNA: In course of raids in different parts of the city since Monday night, the police have arrested five persons who are alleged to be active members of the notorious Sultan Mian gang.

According to city SP Ganesh Kumar, the arrested criminals are Santosh alias Nokia, Santosh Jha, Rajesh Kumar, Mukesh Kumar and Bhavani Kumar.

Kumar said the arrested persons have confessed their involvement in a number of cases, including the recent bomb explosions near a coaching institute under the Sri Krishnapuri police station and a medicine shop in Indrapuri area under the Pataliputra police station.

He said they were extorting money in the name of Sultan Mian from businessmen and other persons. ""The same gang was involved in the case of snatching valuables from a lady doctor,"" the SP added after interrogating the arrested persons. He maintained they were active in areas under different police stations, including Buddha Colony, Patalipura Colony and Sri Krishnapuri.

Earlier, a police team led by officer in-charge of Pataliputra police station, Alok Kumar, raided several places in search of criminals.

In another arrest, the police held two persons -- Gandhi and Munna -- from an area under the Kankarbagh police station. When contacted, officer in-charge of Kankarbagh, Karn Lal, said they have confessed their involvement in the recent attack on a Mumbai-based trader, Dipak, near Chiraiyatand.

Dipak was shot at and injured in the incident. The police have also recovered a new camera from their possession.

""The camera was purchased by them from the money snatched from the trader,"" Lal added.

6,State ministers keen to fight LS polls,"PATNA: Even as RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav is trying to find new allies for the next Lok Sabha polls, a large number of ministers have thrown their hats in the ring as aspirants for the party tickets.

Building construction minister Mohd Taslimuddin, health minister Shakuni Choudhary, primary education minister Ram Chandra Purbey, junior health minister Akhilesh Singh and small scale industry minister Ravindra Charan Yadav are among them.

â€œI am naturally a claimant for the Kishanganj Lok Sabha seat. I contested from there in the last election. But my son Sarfaraz Ahmad is also trying for a ticket from Purnia,â€� remarked Taslimuddin on Tuesday. The minister apparently considers his claim on Kishanganj as final.

Excise minister Shivanand Tiwari is also keen to fight from Buxar seat, which he lost to the BJP last time.

However, he will have to face arch foe and junior minister Dadan Pahalwan. After a war of attrition with Tiwari for the past four years, the maverick minister has announced his intention to contest this seat. Revenue minister Ramai Ram has announced his intention to contest from Hajipur seat.

Shakuni Choudhary, who unsuccessfully contested from Banka last time, is likely to ask for ticket from Khagaria.

Pooranmasi Ram is already considered a sure candidate from the Bagha seat.

This has, however, disheartened RJD workers and even MLAs who want to become Lok Sabha member.

The demand for tickets by ministers and the compulsions of alliances have led to apprehensions that a crisis may erupt during ticket distribution.

7,Jharkhand CM's no to early polls,"RANCHI: Chief minister Arjun Munda on Tuesday made it clear that assembly elections would take place only when it is due and not before that.

â€œWhile the party has decided to go in for an early Lok Sabha elections, the state assembly elections would take place at its scheduled time,â€� Munda said ending all speculations over simultaneous polls.

Munda,who was speaking to media persons on his return after attending the BJPâ€™s national executive committee meeting, narrated in detail about some important decisions of the meeting. He said the government has slashed the aviation fuel tax to 4 per cent from the existing 25 per cent. Claiming that Jharkhand would be the third state to charge such a low fuel tax, he said the decision has been taken in order to boost the aviation industry in the region.

The decision would cost the state exchequer something around Rs 1.5 crore, but as more aircrafts would get fuel from here, the loss would be minimised, Munda said.

He also said the government has spoken to the civil aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy about the beautification and expansion of the airport and some funds are being allocated for the purpose. More direct flights from the capital are also being worked out. The cabinet also announced the release of a sum of Rs 9 crore, for preparing and issuing voters identity card. It has also transferred the job of preparing identity cards from Lucknow-based-Instrumentation to Kolkata based CMC.

Also, a committee under chief secretary would be constituted to grant permission to IT firms to lay down optical fiber cables. There would be no charge for getting the proposal cleared, but the firm would have to provide the state government with 2-mega bytes bandwidth free of cost.

Besides, Munda also gave directions to include in the next meeting a proposal to distribute free books to students studying up to Class VIII in all the government schools.

8,Re-arrest lifers: HC to DGP,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Tuesday directed DGP W H Khan to rearrest within four weeks the lifers who had been released from Bihar prisons in 1994 before completing their full jail term of 14 years.

A division bench comprising Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice R S Garg passed the order in presence of the DGP, who had been summoned by the court to report on the compliance of the similar order passed by the high court in 1999.

The order on Tuesday was passed on a writ petition filed by Uday Chandra Das in 1999 which challenged the state governmentâ€™s decision and the subsequent release of 136 lifers.

The division bench issued a directive to the IG of prisons to provide the DGP with a list of the lifers who had been released from prisons in undivided Bihar in 1994 before completing their full jail term of 14 years.

The DGP was asked to inform the court on February 11 about the number of such rearrested lifers as also about the further action to be taken to rearrest the rest of them.

Counsel Bipin Behari Singh appeared on behalf of the petitioner.

The judges made it clear to the DGP that contempt of court proceedings would be initiated against the government and concerned officials if the order for rearrest of such lifers is not complied with.

The bench also directed the DGP to ask the officers in charge of all police stations in Patna to remove encroachments from roads in areas under their respective jurisdiction, adding that those officers in charge who fail to do so would be liable to face action under contempt of court.

Contempt plea against CM: A division bench comprising Chief Justice R S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh on Tuesday adjourned for 10 days the hearing of the contempt of court petition filed against chief minister Rabri Devi, challenging the propriety of the CM making a direct phone call to the Chief Justice regarding the order passed earlier by Justice R S Garg putting chief secretary K A H Subramanian under judicial custody.

9,Staff selection to be streamlined,"KOLKATA: Candidates empanelled by the West Bengal College Service Commission can expect a better deal from next year.

The commission has at last woken up to the need for gearing up its system. It has failed to provide most of the selected candidates to the colleges despite vacancies this year. The panel tenure expires on January 29.

Commission chairman Ajit Kumar Banik blamed the colleges for not intimating their vacancies beforehand.

â€œEven if they do, they donâ€™t furnish the roster specifying vacancies in the general and reserved categories respectively,â€� he said. Some city colleges, however, shot back saying they had sent the list well in advance.

But, Banik isnâ€™t going to allow the blame game to go on. â€œWe have already made public notification urging colleges to send the list of possible vacancies by March.

They will have to make a list of teachers retiring in 2005, categorise them rosterwise and send it to us by March 31, 2004. That will help us allot the selected candidates to colleges from the next year.

We have also sent letters to individual colleges and intimated the affiliating universities, too,â€� the chairman said. The chairman claimed that the commission was following high court directives. â€œWe will draw up the panel next year also and if colleges fail to furnish the list of vacancies beforehand, they will be at fault,â€� said Banik.

Among the city colleges that suffered this year are Vidyasagar College, Surendranath College, Acharya Prafulla Chandra College, South Calcutta Girlsâ€™ College, Womenâ€™s College, Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama Narendrapur and Belur colleges, Ashutosh College, Motijheel College, Rashtraguru Surendranath College and Barasat College.

Their problem though was mostly with the SC/ST posts, for which the commission could not provide suitable candidates.

â€œWe wrote to these colleges, advising them to apply to the backward classes welfare department for dereservation of these seats. There is no point keeping these reserved when the commission is not getting SC/ST candidates for these subjects for the past five years. Not that we are depriving SC/ST candidates while providing opportunity to others!â€� Banik said.

The vacancies are mostly in Bengali, geography, economics, chemistry, physics, molecular biology, microbiology, sociology, journalism and anthropology, according to commission records.

Heeding the advise, the colleges have started approaching the department. â€œWhile some colleges have already approached us for dereservation, it will take some time before we grant them that,â€� said a CSC official.

10,India's exports doubled since entry into WTO in 1995,"NEW DELHI: India''s exports have nearly doubled to $51.7 billion in 2002-03 from $26.3 billion in 1994-95, in less than a decade since it became the member of the World Trade Organisation in 1995.

India''s share in total world exports of goods and commercial services has gone up to 0.86 per cent in 2001 from 0.61 per cent in 1995, an official release said here on Wednesday.

In total world imports of goods and commercial services during the same period, the country''s share has increased to 0.99 per cent from 0.78 per cent.

By being a WTO member, India also avails of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment and National Treatment for its exports to other WTO members.

Regarding textiles, in accordance with the WTO agreement on textile and clothing, all WTO member countries were required to integrate specific volumes of their textiles and clothing trade into the WTO framework.

In addition, the size of quotas was expanded annually by the restraining countries that maintained the quota.

These measures have led to increase in market access, to a certain extent, although most of these quotas would be removed only at the last stage of integration on December 31, 2004, the release said.

With effect from January 2005, the entire textiles and clothing trade would get integrated into multilateral framework of the WTO, with the completion of the phase-out of the regime of textile quotas.

11,Bahrain for increased trade ties with India,"NEW DELHI: Expressing the desire to forge closer socio-economic and trade ties with India, Bahrain on Wednesday said it favoured increased communication between the peoples of both countries to help discuss issues of mutual benefit.

Bahrain''s Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa said more frequent visits between the people and officials of both countries would be mutually beneficial as this would give the opportunity to know each others'' resources and potentials and develop a better understanding.

Addressing a FICCI-CII business meeting here, he invited Indian investors to tap the country''s potential in areas of IT, tourism and healthcare services.

Bahrain''s Commerce Minister Ali Saleh al-Saleh said industries should not restrict to Bahrain alone as ""the entire region is a potential market for Indian businessmen and can be easily accessed through a regional base in Bahrain.""

Highlighting Bahrain''s strategic geographical location in the Gulf region backed by solid infrastructure and investor friendly policies, Al Saleh said he expected ""greater investments"" from India.

""Many Indian businessmen have already chosen Bahrain as their home in the region. We have over 300 Indian-owned businesses operating in and out of Bahrain,"" he said.

12,Trees cut to erect tents for Sonia's rally,"BATHINDA: When a dignitary guest of a state government has to visit the state, the rules and regulations are never of paramount concern. So if Bathinda district administration axes some big trees for the reason that these were obstruction in erecting a tent for a rally, which is scheduled to be addressed by AICC chief Sonia Gandhi on January 15 here, it could not be a big concern for the forest department.

But for the ecologists it is really heartbreaking. About one dozen full-developed trees were axed and many younger ones were uprooted in the area of Transport Nagar here on Monday for levelling of the ground to put up a huge tent.

To eliminate all bits and pieces of the axed trees, while the big ones were sold by the contractor without any delay, the labourers were quick in ploughing the land on which the younger trees were uprooted.

No officer in the forest department is in mood of making a comment regarding axing of the tress. Sanjay Bansal, district forest officer Bathinda said he had no information about axing of any tree at the Transport Nagar site. Otherwise also, he says , the forest department is not supposed to take care of these trees which were standing in Transport Nagar.

But sources in the department said that trees were axed in the presence of many senior officers in the district. So there is no possibility of taking any legal action for illegal axing of the trees.

13,Hizbul rules out talks with govt,"SRINAGAR: Ruling out talks with government, pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen on Wednesday described the reported statement of Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on the possibility of talks between the Centre and the militant outift as ""baseless"".

""Sayeed has not initiated any talks with us. His statement is baseless. It is a conspiracy against Hizbul Mujahideen,"" the outfit''s chief operations commander Gazi Nasiruddin said in a statement to a local newspaper.

The chief minister was quoted by local media yesterday as saying that he was confident about a possible talks between the Centre and Hizbul and that the government has opened a channel with the outfit in this regard.

There was a change at different levels and there was strong possibility of the Centre renewing its invitation to HGizbul Mujahideen for talks. There had been talks between the Centre and Hizbul in the past (July 2000) but the nature of talks this time would be different, Sayeed was quoted as saying.

Gazi said only tripartite talks involving India, Pakistan and the people of Kashmir could solve the Kashmir issue. The three parties should sit together and find a solution to the Kashmir issue as per UN resolutions.

14,"Badal will be re-arrested, if meddles with proofs: VB","LUDHIANA: Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal will be arrested again, if he is found tampering with the proofs, said Mohammad Izhar Alam, the new Chief of Vigilance Bureau, Punjab.

Alam was visiting the Vigilance Bureau, Ludhiana in a routine visit after taking over the department.

Alam said though so far Badal had not taken any steps to meddle with the proofs, but if he did, it would certainly lead to his re-arrest.

Moreover, Alam clarified that the Vigilance Bureau did not intend to cancel Badal''s bail. He said similar rumours had been spread in the newspapers lately. He clarified that only the investigations carried out during the inquiry will seal the former CM''s fate, and also informed that no fresh FIR had been lodged against Badal.

Alam said six to seven complaints were lodged against the former chief minister, of which the Vigilance Bureau had already presented chalan in four or five cases. He explained that the VB was investigating the rest of the complaints, and said as most of them were pertaining to foreign countries, and the VB could only function within their rules and regulations, it was an uphill task to collect proof against Badal.

Alam, who is the chief executive officer of the Waqf board showed concern over the dissipating control over Waqf board land and property.

Alam informed that in Ludhiana city alone there were 23000 different properties of the board, of which 6000 were religious centers of big and small sizes. All the same, 10000 other sites were illegally captivated by different private parties, which had largely become a matter of concern for the organization.

Alam said while the board was pursuing the matter in the courts, it had not been able to establish harmonious support from the police or the district administration in recovering the land back.

Alam said the Waqf board would be keen to rent out and lease out the land at extremely reasonable prices, once the board can steer the properties clear off the land grabbers. He expatiated that land would be meted out for eleven months for agricultural purposes, while a longer contract of 36 months will be signed for commercial use.

Meanwhile, the Vigilance chief steered clear of all discrepancies between former CM, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, and her recent throws at the present Chief Minister, Capt. Amarinder Singh.

17,Antony seeks compromises from party workers,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Congress workers should be ready for ""compromises"" in settling the issues plaguing the party state unit, Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony said on Wednesday.

""Congress at the national level has compromised to form a secular front and so Congressmen in the state also should follow suit forgetting small differences and disputes,"" Antony told reporters after a cabinet meeting.

18,Antony-Thangal talks a political gimmick: INL,"KOZHIKODE: Describing as a ""political gimmick"" the talks between Muslim League leader Panakkad Syed Mohammedali Shihab Thangal and Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony, Indian National League on Wednesday questioned the validity of the ""secret"" talks between the two leaders as Thangal did not represent the entire minority community in the state.

""Thangal is not the sole spiritual leader of the entire Muslim community in the state and therefore the closed door talks held by him with Antony to sort out the differences in the wake of latter''s anti-minority remarks are not acceptable to the community as a whole"", S A Puthiyavalappil and P M A Salam, INL state president and secretary respectively, told reporters here.

They said the discussions were only aimed at smoothening the strained relations between the two parties and that Antony had done nothing to correct his earlier statement that the minorities were using bargaining powers to enjoy more benefits.

""The Government has also not taken any decision so far to implement the recommendations of the Narendran Commission calling for job reservations for minorities"", they said, adding the INL would stage a secretariat march on January 27 demanding immediate implementation of the report.

Accusing the Muslim League, the second largest partner in the Congress-led UDF, of indulging in `rampant corruption'' in several departments, they said the concerned ministers should either quit or be removed from office before ordering a detailed probe into the allegations.
