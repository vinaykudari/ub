0,"Students clash, destroy property","KOCHI: Nearly 200 students of the Cochin University of Science and Technology clashed with each other and damaged property worth nearly Rs two lakh at the college campus at nearby Kalamassery on Wednesday morning.

Sixteen students have been injured.

Police said that the incidence was sequel to the attack on three students last night allegedly by the SFI activists. The three students of the Hindi Department have been hospitalised at the Aluva Taluk Hospital.

Protesting against the attack, over 100 students took out a march to the Administrative Office of the CUSAT on Wednesday. As the procession reached the School of Engineering, nearly 50 SFI members blocked them. They allgedly attacked Cochin University Engineering Association (CUEA) Chairman Maneksha Mohan, using swords, they said.

Soon the two groups clashed and the SFI students, who were fewer in number, ran for cover at the Ship Technology Department and closed the doors. The other group then started pelting stones, damaging the window panes of the department. They forced their way inside the department and broke the laboratory equipments, Police said.

Twentyfive students had been taken into custody by Police.

The university had suspended classes indefinitely, university sources said.

1,"This Diwali, the party is over at 10","NEW DELHI: If last year''s Diwali left you searching for cotton balls to stuff into your tormented ears, this year might be no different. Unless the enforcement agencies pull up their act, that is.

For one, the anti-cracker drive initiated by the Delhi government six years back, seems to have lost steam. The only purpose it seems to have served is greater awareness among schoolchildren.

What better proof than this that the government''s own pollution control agency, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), has said that the noise levels went up at 16 of the 30 locations monitored by them last year.

The only solace in the noise levels recorded last year by DPCC was that the peak was lower, the highest being 91.2 decibels in the affluent business class-dominated Karol Bagh area.

This was lower than the previous year''s 100 decibels, recorded in Paschim Vihar.

The permissible limit, however, is 55 decibels only.

Even the directive of the ministry of environment to cracker manufacturers, asking them to display the decibel level on crackers might have a limited effect. The manufacturers have expressed their inability to display the levels on each cracker, but will do it on the larger boxes.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Police have acquired sound meters which can record the sound-level of loudspeakers, crackers and generators. This meter will provide ""sound"" evidence to prosecute violators. If found guilty, an offender can be sentenced for five years and directed to pay a fine of upto Rs 1 lakh.

The issue is whether the police will be proactive. According to the Supreme Court order, crackers should be burst between 6 pm and 10 pm. DPCC officials say the citizens can approach the area police if the noise levels go beyond the permissible limits.

2,Govt gives indications of early elections,"HYDERABAD: Chandrababu Naidu may be keeping his cards close to his chest, but there are enough indicators that suggest elections are in the air. That the parties are getting ready for polls is clear and the government machinery is being cranked up for the big fight.

The mandatory naxalite-bashing has hit a shriller note. Intelligence agencies are working to collate data on the possible winning horses. There''s talk of a likely shake-up in the administration. The process of doling out sops too has been put on the fast track. Political analysts say these are indications of an early election. ""The CM has decided not to convene the next budget session scheduled for March 2004. He is clearly scouting for a reason to convince all on the need for an early poll,"" a senior IAS officer reasoned.

Once an official announcement on the elections is made, the proactive chief election commissioner J M Lyngdoh might just put a stops on Naidu announcing populist schemes. ""Once the CM talks of snap polls, neither the opposition nor the election commission will allow him to float his schemes,"" the sources pointed out.

Sympathy: A key plank on which Naidu is likely to go to the electorate is naxalism. The naxalite attack on him is likely to figure prominently in his election rhetoric.

Schemes: The chief minister is said to have asked the finance department to secure a Rs 1,800-crore loan from the World Bank to fuel his ''Koti Varalu'' (one crore benefits) scheme. He is keeping a close eye to ensure execution of several sops by end of this month.

Administration: The ministers are reportedly being told to scout for officers who could act as returning officers in the elections. A large-scale reshuffle of officers too is on the cards.

Intelligence: The intelligence-gathering machinery has gone to the people with a simple questionnaire, asking them if they are for the present government, their MLA, their CM etc.

Trade: Politicians have already got in touch with the businessmen seeking funds.

3,Alaknanda: No reason to party,"NEW DELHI: The festival season usually brings cheer to people''s life. But for the residents of Mandakini Enclave it just means inconvenience. Sharing a wall with with Jahanpanah Club has proved its undoing.

Residents complain that visitors to the club park their vehicles in front of the colony''s gates. ""By late evening there is no space for us to get out of the colony. Earlier they parked inside the colony too. We were able to stop that somehow,"" said Nirmal Madan, a resident.

Drunken brawls are a common occurrence too. ""Liquor bottles are thrown inside the colony park. It is a tremendous security hazard for young children and women,"" a resident, who did not want to be named, said. The residents have written to the MCD complaining against the club.

MCD commissioner Rakesh Mehta said he was looking in to the matter. ""Parking in public spaces is equal to encroachment. We will take action if the club is found to be disobeying,"" Mehta said.

Colonel Dhir from Jahanpanah Club, however, flatly denied that the club was misusing public space for parking. ""We have all the relevant papers and are adhering to all regulations,"" he added.

Residents had complaints over several issues. In fact, the club was ordered to shut down almost three years back by an order issued by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The order issued in August 2000 (DPCC/S-Kal/VIP-Co mp./97/2) says that the two diesel generator sets were polluting the area and disturbing the residents.

6,"Clinics at government hospitals to prevent Aids, HIV","PATNA: With a view to preventing parents to child transmission of Aids and HIV, the Bihar government on Wednesday directed the superintendents of all the six government medical college hospitals of the state to set up an anti-natal clinic (ANC) at each of the hospitals.

The ANCs are to be established under the programme for prevention of parents to child transmission of Aids and HIV. The National Aids Control Organisation had directed all the states to establish ANCs at all the government medical college hospitals under the programme.

The six government medical college hospitals of Bihar will receive Rs 2.17 lakh each for establishing the ANCs. Each of the ANCs will be under the administrative control of the superintendent of the concerned medical college hospital while the head of its obstetrics and gynaecology department will be the nodal officer of the programme.

Project director of the Bihar State Aids Control Society C K Anil, in a communication to the superintendents of all the six government medical college hospitals on October 22, directed them to set up the ANCs near the outdoor patient wings of obstetrics and gynaecology departments of the hospitals. The blood samples to be collected there will be sent to the voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTCs) already established at the hospitals for HIV test. The nodal officers will have to send their reports to the Society on the 5th of every month.

Each of the ANCs will have a woman counsellor and a lab technician to be appointed on contract basis for one year by a three-member committee headed by the superintendent of the hospital concerned. The heads of the obstetrics and gynaecology and microbiology departments of the hospital will be the other two members of the committee. Anil has directed the hospital superintendents to start the process of appointment of women counsellors and lab technicians within a month.

7,Lawyers on road against lawlessness,"PATNA: The functioning of the Patna High Court remained paralysed on Wednesday as lawyers abstained from their work in protest against the murder of their colleague Pramod Kumar Jha here on Monday.

Although judges, including Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan, held courts, but in the absence of lawyers, cases listed for the day were adjourned for Thursday. The high court wore a deserted look.

Later, the lawyers took out a â€œmourning processionâ€� from the Ambedkarâ€™s statue near the HC to the Dak Bungalow Chowk and back to the Hartali Chowk. From there, a delegation of the lawyers went and met CM Rabri Devi and demanded Rs 10 lakh as compensation to Jhaâ€™s wife and a job and immediate arrest of culprits.

Meanwhile, a 19-member delegation of Left Democratic Advocatesâ€™ Front called on governor M Ram Jois and submitted a 5-point memorandum demanding immediate arrest of assailants, compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the bereaved family and job to one of the family members.

The governor expressed his shock and agony at the ghastly murder of Jha. In a press statement issued on Wednesday, he said, â€œIt is a pity that such heinous crimes take place during daytime even in a capital town and the criminals, who come on vehicles are able to escape. Such incidents create a sense of fear. The police should take this as a challenge and ensure that such incidents are not repeated.â€�

8,College rules raked up in ragging row,"KOLKATA: It was a brawl followed by a lecture on morality and not ragging that left two first-year students at Kolaghat Engineering College nursing with bruises on Monday night â€” this was the report of a high-level committee probing the sensational incident on Wednesday.

It was reported that fresher Bhaskar Sanyal had his eyelids burnt by a cigarette lighter during an encounter with seniors. The committee has expressed serious doubts over this version.

The committee members found it ""unusual"" for a person with burnt eyebrows and tortured for 45 minutes not to have been admitted to a hospital. However, five seniors accused of manhandling freshers have been identified and action recommended.

The report held that the hostel incident seemed premeditated as 10 to 15 seniors had gone to the first-year students'' hostel after dark on Monday night.

The problem, sources said, erupted on September 30, when freshers appeared for an examination. Since this was their first break after four months, many relatives had come to take them home.

An elder sister of a victim had come, too. That evening it rained heavily and no one could step out of hostels and were allowed to stay in their ward''s room overnight. Even a sister had put up in her brother''s room.

Since the college reopened, it was agog with rumours that a fresher had brought a female to his room at night. This is strictly banned.

The seniors grabbed this opportunity to lecture freshers. They did that and a bit more. A hostel inmate said that on Monday night, 15 seniors came to Students'' Hostel 1. They scaled the gates, entered the freshers'' rooms and locked it from inside,"" said an inmate.

According to sources, there had been arguments and scuffles between first-year students and their seniors. One victim had an injured forearm and another a black eye. But, the first victim told the committee that he had an old injury and Bhaskar Sanyal did not say that his eyelids were burnt.

He just told the committee that the seniors lit a lighter and said let us see your face, sources said.

Principal Jamini Kanta Dass confirmed the committee findings. ""The matter has been forwarded to the disciplinary committee for necessary action. They would decide the punishment,"" Prof. Das said.

The principal said police patrol had been increased. He claimed that ""the lure of an extended holiday"" had prompted first-year students to leave hostels.

9,HC stays Maya’s arrest,"LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court here on Wednesday stayed the arrest of former chief minister Mayawati, then principal secretary PL Punia and then secretary (environment) VK Gupta in the multicrore Taj Heritage Corridor (THC) scam till the conclusion of the investigation.

The high court has also stayed the arrest of Mayawati in the matter of â€˜disproportionate assets or propertiesâ€™ case till filing of the report.

These orders were passed on four writ petitions by a division Bench comprising Justice Khem Karan and Justice GK Gupta, filed separately by Mayawati, Punia and Gupta in the Taj scam case and another petition filed by the former CM in the disproportionate assets case.

The court observed that the petitioners shall co-operate with the ongoing investigation and shall not leave the country without written permission of the court concerned.

The high court had reserved its verdict on Tuesday after hearing the arguments of petitionersâ€™ counsels SC Misra, Arun Sinha, Mridul Rakesh, Rakesh Dhar Dwivedi, CBI counsel Bireshwar Nath, and AK Singh, government advocate who had appeared for the state.

Disposing of the writ petitions of Mayawati, Punia and Gupta seeking quashing of the FIR registered against them in the Taj scam case, the bench said the petitioners would not be arrested till conclusion of investigations by a common judgment.

The court similarly disposed of finally the other writ petition filed by Mayawati challenging the validity of the FIR in disproportionate assets case, also staying her arrest by a separate order.

10,Manufacturers seek govt. blessings to warm up market,"PUNE: The Maharashtra solar manufacturersâ€™ association (MSMA) is planning to present a memorandum to the state government, asking it to make the use of solar energy mandatory for all buildings in the state in a phased manner. The 60-member association will also ask the government to help promote solar energy in the state.

â€œWe plan to meet the energy minister in a weekâ€™s time and present him with a memorandum of our demands,â€� said Sushil Pungaliya, MSMA president. In the first phase, all hotels, hospitals, hostels and commercial buildings which require regular hot water should go in for solar heating systems.

All new constructions, and then all other existing buildings, would have to follow, according to the MSMAâ€™s charter.

If this is done, the solar energy market in the state would grow 10-fold within a year, from the current Rs 20 crore, Pungaliya estimated. Another important demand of the association is to print the slogan â€˜Use solar, save energyâ€™, on every MSEB bill. â€œThis is a cost-effective way of spreading awareness about the use of solar energy,â€� he said.

The association will also press the government to reserve about 2 paise out of MSEBâ€™s revenue generated from every unit of power towards propagation of solar energy and incentives to the sector.

Compared to 1.6 million solar heat collectors used in China, in India less than a lakh collectors have been installed so far, he added.

The MSMA held an awareness meet in Pune on Wednesday among all stakeholders, including the government, banks, the MSEB, builders and architects. The association plans to hold similar meets in Aurangabad and Kolhapur as well.

â€œPeople should be made aware that a solar water heater, priced at Rs 25,000, works out less expensive than an electric heater priced at Rs 4,000,â€� said Pungaliya. For both, the initial investment is Rs 4,000, followed by a monthly outflow of Rs 400 to Rs 500 paid to MSEB in case of electric heaters â€” and in the case of solar heaters, the same is payable to the bank as EMI, but for 5 years only.

The average life of a solar heater is 20 years and for the remaining 15 years there is no additional recurring expenditure, Pungaliya said. â€œAlso, solar energy is eco-friendly.â€�

Mayor Deepti Chaudhary said the Pune municipal corporation was seriously considering the MSMA proposal for 5 per cent rebate in property tax for those who fix solar water heaters at home.

11,Hema not fielded for Delhi polls: BJP,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday dismissed as totally wrong reports that actress and Rajya Sabha member Hema Malini was being pitted by the party in the ensuing Delhi Assembly polls.

""These reports are totally wrong and misinformed,"" he said, adding while the Madhya Pradesh list would be finalised by the Election Committee on November 3, Chhattisgarh would be completed on November 4 and Rajasthan on November 5.

Naidu also released the names of candidates for eight Assembly seats in Mizoram.

13,States to relax felling and transit rules,"NEW DELHI: The Union government will ask states to relax felling and transit rules for forest produce from land which is private or falls in the non-forest category.

This is aimed at encouraging people to grow trees on their land.

This, by all accounts, was a vociferous demand as the National Afforestation and Ecodevelopment Board, comprising state and NGO representatives as well as MPs, met on Wednesday after a three-year gap. The board meeting was chaired by Environment Minister Baalu.

A thrust area for the ministry is supposed to be increasing the country''s tree cover to 25 per cent of the land area within four years, achieving the ideal of 33 per cent by 2012. Forest cover is now inching up, either because there is more green or because the authorities are just including more in the definition of green.

To reach the 33 per cent target, an additional 33.6 million hectares of land has to be brought under forest or tree cover. Recorded forest area can only provide additional land of about 4.7 million hectares -- so the government needs to encourage small and marginal farmers, and the poor in rural areas, to grow trees.

15,Open skies policy draws flak from IA,"KOLKATA: The Union civil aviation ministryâ€™s decision to allow Air Sahara and Jet Airways to fly to Colombo has drawn widespread criticisms from different sections of Indian Airlines employees.

Terming it a deliberate attempt to weaken the national carrier, airline staff lambasted aviation minister Pratap Rudy for criticising IA and Air India of being unable to meet the demand.

Justifying the open sky policy, Rudy argued that since the carriers were not able to utilise bilateral rights, they could be handed over to private operators. While Lankan carrier SriLankan Airlines flies to eight Indian destinations, IA operates only between Chennai and Colombo.

â€œFor five years, the government failed to clear the fleet expansion and modernisation plans of the two state-owned carriers. Now, that the airlines are crippled with an ageing fleet, they are making wild accusations to justify the entry of private airlines into foreign airspace,â€� officials said.

They pointed out that a government decision had grounded the A-320 aircraft in 1990, allowing private players to enter the market and gain a toehold.

Aggrieved IA employees plan to approach Opposition leaders to take up the issue in the winter session of Parliament. Even senior officials admitted that they felt let down by the move.

â€œThe government wants IA to compete but burdens it with social responsibilities. It has been losing nearly Rs 100 crore an annum on unremunerative sectors like the northeast,â€� they said, pointing out that private players only had cursory services on these sectors.

IA employees fear that Sahara and Jet would soon be allowed to fly into other Saarc nations and later to Asean countries. Officials said the IA would now press for flights between Kolkata and south east Asian destinations like Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong to brace up for competition.

A shortage of aircraft has severely affected IAâ€™s operations in several sectors including the lucrative Bangkok-Gaya route which has witnessed a spurt in demand from Buddhist tourists. ""Weâ€™d be glad to introduce flights between Gaya and Colombo. But where is the aircraft,"" officials said in frustration.

SriLankan Airlines, which began a weekly flight between Gaya and Colombo last year, has decided to increase the frequency to twice a week from following a surge in demand.

16,"Soon, hawkers will rule the streets","MUMBAI: What will be Mumbai like in next few years? It is very easy to know, thanks to trade union leader, Mr Sharad Rao. Just close your eyes and you will see hawkers occupying every vacant place, may it be a ground, foot path, road or a bridge, trying to sell anything and everything, from pin to Piano.

And people even constructing hutments on rail routes and roads, blocking rail as well as road traffic, with poor tax payers and law abiding citizens having no place to walk and no means to commute.

But, it is OK. People having no way to walk or vehicles having no way to move, is not as important as hawkers enjoying their right to sell goods, even causing lot of inconvenience. Mr Rao has suggested to the pedestrians to walk on car roofs.

This is the new ''urban justifying encroachments theory'' propagated by ''great philosopher'' Mr Rao. He not only justifies encroachment on public open spaces, but even encourages it on people''s privacy.

According to him, your housing society or building has no right to stop hawkers from entering the premises and sell their goods. They can knock your door at any time to sell you goods.

As a mark of protest against people''s opposition to Mr Rao''s ''hawkers'' free movement mission'', the hawkers are going to blacken all such boards preventing hawkers'' entry to the buildings.

Hawkers'' menace has increased speedily during last few years. Earlier, in the areas near railway stations in suburbs, hawkers were occupying part of foot-path or roadside.

Then a second row of hawkers started appearing in front of them. And now the third row has taken over.

Legal shop owners are finding it difficult to do business as their entrances are blocked by hawkers and hence nobody wants to go to these shops. Same is the case with building entrances.

Moving a car in or out of a building compound is fully at the mercy of hawkers occupying positions in front of the building gates.

Any argument with the hawkers can turn into altercations, heated exchange of words, abuses, with all nearby hawkers joining hands against law abiding citizens.

For Mr Rao it is obviously a question of mustering support of over 1.5 lakh strong mob of hawkers for his survival. And hence he is ready to go to any extent to take their side.

Hawkers'' nuisance in Mumbai is a classic case, exhibiting how ignoring little illegality initially on part of authorities for some short term gains can turn into mass scale attitude of dishonouring the law. And how it becomes impossible to control such things later.

Today at many places, neither civic authorities, nor police, nor citizensâ€™ rule, but the hawkers have their say.

There are some localities in Mumbai, where local citizens'' groups have successfully kept hawkers out of their areas. But these are exceptions and no one knows with increasing ''dadagiri'' of hawkers and their leader, Mr Rao, how many days these groups will succeed in keeping their areas hawkers'' free.

All schemes like hawkers'' plaza etc. have failed. The reason being leaders like Mr Rao have no interest in educating his followers on such issues and telling them their responsibility.

It is clear now that due to various reasons, no authority will be able to clear this nuisance. It is only people, who should take lead in cornering hawkers. If they stop buying from hawkers, they will not be able to survive.

So, the people should stop buying anything from hawkers. After all, it is because of their patronage that also has helped in problem going out of hand.

If it is not controlled now, Mumbaikars may have to hear another ''fatwa'' from Mr. Rao very soon that every household has to buy goods worth of specific amount from hawkers everyday. From the arrogant way and what he has talked today, that day is not far.
