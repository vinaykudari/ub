1,Exam dates clash in May,"NEW DELHI: If you thought huge syllabi, tough question papers and stiff competition make exams a pain, you probably haven''t been caught in an exam clash before.

Hundreds of students in the city seem to be in for trying times ahead, with a number of important examinations clashing with each other in May.

Here''s how some of the collisions set for the coming month look like. Delhi university''s school of correspondence B.Com exams and the Institute of Charted Accountants of India''s CA examinations have overlapping time schedules. Both I.P university''s entrance for the LLB programme and the Pune based Symbiosis Law Society''s law entrance fall on May 1.

""It''s really unfortunate for us as we are being forced to narrow down our choice. I can only appear for one of the examinations,"" rues Rishi Thusu, who is hoping to pursue law after Class XII.

A number of students pursuing B.Com honours at DU''s school of correspondence say that the exam clash will mean a gap of one year in their studies.

""The micro economics and business studies papers scheduled for May 21 and 25 respectively, clash with CA exams I am to appear for. This is the first time DU postponed its correspondence exams by a month and now students have to bear the brunt,"" said a first year student, Pratik Jain.

University authorities, however, say delaying exams is not a possibility as DU would be starting its admission session in June.

""We understand the students'' dilemma but technical problems do not permit us to change dates. Rescheduling will upset the entire academic cycle as results will also get delayed,"" said DU controller of examinations B S Garg.

Another close exam encounter is set between Common Entrance Test (CET) of Karnataka and the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE). The former is to be held on May 18 and 19, while the latter exam conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is scheduled for May 20 and 21.

""My son was to appear for both exams but his centres are in Karnataka and Delhi. There''s no way he can come back in time for AIEEE as all flights are full,"" complained Rajesh Aggarwal, a father.

2,Teenaged lovers attempt suicide in east Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Two teenaged lovers attempted suicide on Thursday night in the New Ashok Nagar area in east Delhi.

The girl, 16, and boy, 17, tried to kill themselves by slitting their throats with a blade.

The note states that the two wanted to end their lives because they were apprehensive about whether ""society"" would accept their relationship. Hassan, however, said their parents were unaware of it.

""When we questioned them, they claimed that the children had never spoken to them,"" she added.

According to the police, the girl and boy have been neighbours since childhood. Their parents are employed with the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL).

On Thursday night, the girl went to the boy''s house. In the morning, the boy''s father saw them lying in an unconscious state.

3,'President's rule not an issue',"PATNA: Senior BJP leader and Union health and parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on Friday said that imposition of Presidentâ€™s Rule in Bihar was not at all a relevant issue as far as the Lok Sabha elections were concerned. Swaraj denied that BJP had decided to impose Presidentâ€™s rule in the state if NDA returned to power.

Swaraj while admitting that Bihar had been a fit case for imposition of Presidentâ€™s rule for the past several years, said that the Centre could not take any decision in this regard unless the governor sent a report recommending for the same. Swaraj while maintaining that governorâ€™s recommendation was a pre-requisite for invoking Article 356 in any state, said that the final decision in this regard was always taken by the Union cabinet.

Deputy PM L K Advani too had on April 8 said here that non-governance was not a ground for imposition of Presidentâ€™s rule in the state. JD(U) president and defence minister George Fernandes had recently announced that NDA would impose Presidentâ€™s rule in Bihar if it returned to power at the Centre.

Swaraj while lashing out at the RJD government for lack of development in the state, said the state lacked good governance. Expressing her satisfaction over the performance of NDA in the first phase of LS polls in the country, she said that its performance would be still better in the second and third phases of the LS polls scheduled for April 26 and May 5. She said that NDA would win more than 32 LS seats in Bihar.

She said that it was for the first time in the history of the country that development had emerged as a main issue in the LS polls. She said that Muslims no longer considered BJP an anathema and had voted for it in the first phase of polls.

State convener of NDA campaign committee and information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and spokesperson of the party Kiran Ghai were also present at the Press conference.

She said that the NDA gov ernment had ushered in sev eral electoral reforms during its regime.

These included mandatory filing of affidavits by all the candidates giving details of the assets owned by them as well as criminal cases, if any, pending against them. Apart from it, she said, NDA government had also initiated anti-defection measures besides fixing the maximum size of the Union and state cabinets.

Replying to a query, Swaraj said that there was no question of BJP seeking Samajwadi Partyâ€™s help to form government at the Centre as it would secure a massive majority on its own in the LS polls. Swaraj had on Thursday addressed election meetings in five parliamentary constituencies in North Bihar. They included Darbhanga, Bettiah and Muzaffarpur. She would again campaign in the state on May 2.

7,SC to hear exit polls ban case on Monday,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will hear on Monday a public interest petition seeking a ban on publication, broadcast and telecast of opinion and exit polls till the last phase of elections is over on May 10.

Petitioner''s counsel mentioned the PIL before a Bench of Justices R C Lahoti and Ashok Bhan, wanting it to be taken up immediately. However, the court said it would be taken up on Monday.

In his PIL, petitioner D K Thakur contended that opinion and exit polls were contrary to the provisions of the Representation of People''s Act.

He submitted that such polls affected the mental make-up of the electorate and influenced the exercise of franchise by them. The petitioner also questioned the methodology adopted by various organisations which have undertaken such polls.

He urged the apex court to direct the Election Commission to ensure that its guidelines on exit and opinion polls were enforced. Apart from the EC and the Centre, the petitioner has also impleaded the Press Council of India as a party in the case.

Earlier, the EC had convened an all-party meeting to discuss the issue at which all major political parties had agreed that opinion and exit polls should not be published/telecast/broadcast till the last vote was cast.

8,"After every election, market gets new life","MUMBAI: You can expect to mark up your stock portfolio soon after the new government takes charge next month, since in all probability, there will be a buying spree after the uncertainty surrounding the poll process ends.

That has been the market''s trend after each of the last three Lok Sabha elections â€” in 1996, 1998 and 1999.

Data on BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty show that within four to six weeks of the final results in those three general elections, the indices touched a new temporary peak and gained 8-13.5 per cent.

In fact, the gains were as high as 25 per cent if one considers the rise in the indices from the first day of the poll till the short-term peak is reached.

In 1999, when the BJP-led coalition won the elections, the Sensex witnessed a 380 point (8 per cent) rally to breach the 5,000 level.

""In 1999, there was a clear mandate (for the BJP and its allies) and hence the euphoric rally that we saw just after the elections that year,"" said Ambareesh Baliga, V-P, Karvy Stockbroking.

In 1999, within days of the polls, the Nifty rallied 8 per cent from 1,393 to reach a peak of 1,505 and the Sensex also moved up the same percentage.

Even in 1996 and 1998, when no party got a clear mandate and the governments were multi-party coalitions, the market rallied as investors were relieved of poll-related uncertainties.

""Those (1996 and 1998) were end-of-the-uncertainty kind of situation,"" said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services.

In 1998, after the election outcome, the Sensex spurted 13.5 per cent to 4,281 while the Nifty clocked a 10.5 per cent gain to 1,231. Likewise, the two benchmark indices gained 10.2 per cent and 9.7 per cent, respectively, after the 1996 polls.

Market players however said it is mostly retail investors who enter the market during these post-poll rallies, while ''smart money'' exits.

""Smart operators return only when there are signs of consolidation in the market... after the new government is formed and expectations for the budget start building up,"" said a domestic fund manager.
