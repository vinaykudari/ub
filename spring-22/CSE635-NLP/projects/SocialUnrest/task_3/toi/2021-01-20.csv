1,12 lakh state staff to hold rally today,"LUCKNOW: Twelve lakh employees of the Uttar Pradesh Karamchari Mahasangh will hold demonstration all over the state in support of the ongoing strike of Jawahar Bhawan and Indira Bhawan employees on Wednesday in protest against the delay in non-fulfilment of their 15 demands.

On Tuesday in Lucknow, offices in the two buildings were locked up and the employees gathered in the front park to discuss tomorrowâ€™s plan of action. The employees also threatened to close the main gates and restrict any government official from entering the campus, at any moment.

President of the Mahasangh Satish Chandra Pandey told Times News Network the dharna had been organised all over the state. ""In the state capital, our plan is to gather here (Jawahar Bhawan) early morning and proceed towards the Vidhan Sabha in a rally form,"" he said.

Pandey said since the government officials were absolutely non-cooperative, they wont be let off by the Mahasangh until their demands were met. ""We held talks with Principal Secretary Public Works Department (PWD) and Secretary, Personnel, who were more interested in the repair works of the building and not the welfare of the employees,"" he said.

He said though repair works of the building was also part of their 15 demands, welfare of the employees was the top concern for the Mahasangh.

2,"HIV+ persons cannot be denied jobs, rules HC","MUMBAI: In a major judgment welcomed by AIDS activists, the Bombay high court directed the New India Assurance company to bestow permanent employee status on an HIV-positive woman on compassionate grounds.

A bench comprising Justice A P Shah and Justice S C Dharmadhikari ruled last Friday that denying employment to a person solely on grounds of his or her HIV-positive status was discriminatory and violated the person''s constitutional rights.

The woman, who has three minor children, had applied to New India Assurance for a job in 1999 after her husband''s death. Her husband, who was employed with the company when he died, had tested HIV positive in 1997. The company refused to employ her after she too tested positive. Aggrieved, she moved the court in 1999.

The court had at that time directed the company to appoint her on a temporary basis, which it did. The judges, who disposed of the petition, observed that merely having the constitutional right to earn a living was of little use if it was violated.

The judgment, say activists, strikes a blow for thousands of HIVpositive persons. Mumbai alone has between 3.5 to four lakh HIV-infected people, approximately ten per cent of India''s HIV cases.

3,"Pawar may join NDA after polls, says Mahajan","MUMBAI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary Pramod Mahajan on Monday gave a new dimension to the run up to the Lok Sabha elections by indicating that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar may join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the polls.

Mr Mahajan said that the NCP president would be welcome to the NDA fold. ""In fact, the NDA house has no doors. Anybody who accepts the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the NDA manifesto is welcome to join it and this includes Mr Pawar,"" he told newspersons here.

""Mr Pawar is waiting to see the power configuration in Delhi after the parliamentary polls and he will align with the combination which is most powerful,"" he noted.

When it was pointed out that Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray is vehemently opposed to the entry of Mr Pawar into the NDA, Mr Mahajan confidently asserted: ""I will tackle the problem. In fact, I had prepared the groundwork (for Mr Pawarâ€™s entry), but our plan hit a roadblock."" He indicated that talks with Mr Pawar over seatsharing had already taken place before Mr Thackeray put his foot down. Referring to Mr Pawarâ€™s denial, Mr Mahajan said sarcastically: ""After Raja Harishchandra, Mr Pawar is the most truthful person.""

About the Ayodhya temple tangle, Mr Mahajan said it might cease to be an issue during the polls since there was the possibility of a court verdict. He said during the poll campaign the NDA would primarily emphasise on the strong leadership of Mr Vajpayee, the stability of his government and the developmental initiatives taken by the Union ministry. The issue of Congress president Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin would also receive the NDA''s attention, he said.

The BJP leader ridiculed the efforts at the formation of a secular alternative to the NDA. He said the proposed alliance led by Ms Gandhi posed little challenge to the NDA. People who are rallying around Ms Gandhi and the Congress should note that since 1984, no member of the Nehru-Gandhi clan has successfully led the party to victory. ""Nobody remembers the Nehru-Gandhi family anymore. In fact, there are five-crore new voters who have not even seen Indira Gandhi,"" he observed.

4,Staff clash at Writers' over health dept relocation,"KOLKATA: Members of the CPM affiliated Co-ordination Committee of State Government Employees'' Federation and employees of the state health department clashed inside the Writers'' Building on Tuesday.

The scuffle took place during a meeting convened to protest a recent state directive to shift the entire health department to the newly-constructed Swastha Bhavan in Salt Lake.

""Just after we started the meeting some men belonging to the co-ordination committee forcibly entered into the meeting room and started manhandling us. They also used abusive language and tried to throw us out,"" said secretary of the state government employees'' union (Nabaparjay) ''Mahakaran Anchal Committee'', Utpal Majumdar.

Others like Subhas Bagchi of the Mahakaran Sangram Committee, too condemned the attack as ""barbarous"" and demanded immediate punitive action against the guilty.

A section of the state health department officials are up in arms ever since the government decided to shift the health department to Salt Lake, near the fish bheris after Nalban. The new building, they allege, is not large enough to hold all their files and as a result almost half the files will remain in Writers'' Building. ""What is the point of shifting so far if we have to come back to Writers'' to collect files,"" an official said.

Departmental staff also allege that the government is unnecessarily spending over Rs 1 crore to shift the office from the Writers''. ""The firm which is handling the transfer is charging nearly Rs 30 lakh to transfer the files. But the building is not big enough to accommodate all files. We see no logic behind the move,"" another official said.

Employees also alleged that the new building was being converted into the health department office from part of the World Bank''s Rs 700-crore loan â€” given primarily to improve the state''s rural healthcare system.

6,"Mother, child escape Fiat fate by inches","KOLKATA: For the survivors, it was the hand of fate. As the GL 3 bus smashed against the grey Fiat, it was a miracle that three-year-old Rahul Dasgupta, his mother Sugandha and ayah survived.

Rahul, who lives in Kasbaâ€™s Nilachal Abasan, had started for school as usual in the family car, accompanied by his mother and ayah, when the bus hit their car. While the two women escaped with minor injuries, Rahul will need cosmetic surgery for his face. He was taken out of the back seat of the car by a passer-by, just in the nick of time.

The enormity of the accident could be gauged by the condition of the grey Fiat as it lay outside Gariahat PS. The roof had caved in, the wheels smashed. It was indeed a miraculous escape for Rajat and Sugandha Dasguptaâ€™s son, whom the neighbours described as a ""jolly child"".

But the Fiat driver Bhajan Datta probably lost his life even before he could react.

His neighbours were outraged. ""The police did not even bother to inform us of the accident.We gathered whatever information we could from the scene of the accident and the eyewitnesses.

When we contacted the police they did not even talk to us properly. His brother has now gone to the police station to confirm the news"" they told TNN. The other victim was 45-year-old Pradip Nath. Nath, who was a publisher and owned a bookshop, Adi Nath Brothers, on College Street, had started out for the shop, on his motorcycle.

Pradip, who lived in Ashishalaya at Panditiya Place, leaves behind his parents and his wife, who are still in shock.

Even as Pradipâ€™s uncle, Sajal said, ""We have still not informed them that he is dead. They just know he is seriously injured,"" a loud wail pierced through the hushed apartment. News of Pradipâ€™s death had reached his wife and mother.
