3,Rlys ease freight rules for small transporters,"ahmedabad: in a bid to optimise capacity utilisation of the goods train and cater to small time consignors sending lesser quantity of goods, the railways have launched the 'piece meal freight booking' scheme. talking to reporters, chief area manager ahmedabad r k meena said altering the policy of having goods train (rake) with a minimum of 40 wagons and minimum load of 2200 tonnes, the railways have decided to carry lesser loads. ""now, even if we have a load of one wagon, we would arrange for its transportation"" , he added. while offering to transport smaller quantity, the railways have also introduced destination local transport facility, which covers a distance up to 200 km around the nodal junctions to attract small traders. with this the movement of perishable commodities could be speeded up at cheaper rates for small-time wholesalers. the earlier policy allowed only big units to use rail network to translocate raw material and products in bulk. but the new policy would attract more business with services let out for even lesser quantity freight, meena hoped. the prospects of revenue could also improve. meena said the new steps would also help container corporation of india to optimally use its capacity and despatch rakes, fully loaded. off late, rakes had been operating with under load capacity of 20 per cent.

4,Surendranagar BJP men quit over denial of ministership,"rajkot: the fall-out of the ministry formation in the state is being felt in parts of saurashtra where a section of the bjp is not only vocally protesting over non-inclusion of several stalwarts in the narendra modi ministry but also the non-representation of several cities which hitherto had a lot of political clout. dissatisfaction is brewing in centres like rajkot, jamnagar and surendranagar. however, the revolt by the surendranagar unit the was most significant as 125 bjp members have resigned to protest the exclusion of kiritsinh rana in the ministry. they had sent their letters to state bjp president rajendrasinh rana. surendranagar bjp unit president prakash soni said a meeting was organised in a farm house near limbdi where the decison was taken to oppose kiritsinh's exclusion. the meeting was organised by leaders like bjp secretary bipin dave who said the move to keep out kiritsinh could be suicidal for the party as he had played a major role in the party's electoral victory in the assembly and lok sabha elections. they felt leaders in gram panchayats would also desert the party now. a similar move was brewing in rajkot where bjp leaders were planing to resign en masse, overtly to give the chief minister a free hand to revamp the organisation. however, this is a pressure tactic to convey their displeasure at the injustice done to rajkot in the ministry making exercise. what irked the region was that senior ministers, parmanand khattar from jamnagar, mahendra trivedi from bhavnagar, bechar bhadani from amreli and kiritsinh rana from surendranagar have been shown the door.

6,"Traffic rules, no. plates speak different languages","pune: traffic police around the world have strict rules for the way in which vehicle licence plates are displayed.the idea is to be able to accurately identify a traffic offender or a vehicle involved in a crime or accident. however, in pune, vehicle-owners seem to have realised that the best way to get away with a traffic offence, is to make the licence plate illegible. and one of the easiest ways to do that, is to have a plate printed in the devnagri script, even though the law clearly stipulates that it must be in english. even state transport buses sport number plates in the devnagri script. neither the police nor traffic administrators are raising a finger to halt the practice, which could literally help traffic offenders get away with murder. a senior traffic police officer exhibited shocking ignorance about the rules pertaining to licence number plates. ""this is not a major issue for us,"" he said. ""there are many more urgent and complicated problems on our priority list. moreover, none of my constables has complained of problems while jotting down regional language licence plates."" though the central motor vehicles act has a clause which insists on the roman script for vehicle licence plates, the state government has amended the rules. say assistant transport commissioner sanjay sasane, ""the state government has amended the rules in accordance with powers given to it and allowed the dual display of licence plates in roman and devnagri scripts. licence plates written only in devnagri are, however, not allowed."" the regional transport office and the traffic control branch of the city have not registered a single case of violation of this roman script rule, this year. even if someone were to be booked, the fine is a meagre rs 100 for the first offence and rs 300 for repeat offences. it's not just the language issue, vehicle-owners use all sorts of writing styles, materials, sizes and even graffiti, to make licence plates a true showcase of the country's fabled diversity. all that will hopefully change once the hologrammed all-india licence plates are made compulsory. this was to come into effect this year. however, regional transport officer l.p. khade says implementation of these tamper-proof hologram licence plates has been postponed till june 30, 2002, for new vehicles. old vehicle-owners will get two more years in which to switch over to hologram plates. currently not sufficient numbers of these registration plates are available. ""we don't want to start the implementation, and run into a shortage situation,"" says mr khade.

7,CM rules out RTC privatisation,"hyderabad: chief minister n chandrababu naidu on wednesday made it clear that the state government had no intention of privatising the andhra pradesh state road transport corporation (apsrtc). reviewing the ongoing strike of rtc employees which entered the tenth day on wednesday with the members of the cabinet sub-committee and officials, naidu said that some people were 'misleading' the employees of the corporation by 'spreading rumours'. naidu and transport minister b v mohan reddy have renewed their appeal to the striking employees to call off the agitation in view of the hardships being faced by the people. meanwhile, the rtc management had been operating 5,500 buses covering 10 lakh km as against the normal length of 60 lakh km everyday. apsrtc vicechairman and managing director r p singh said that about 5,045 regular employees had joined the duty and 3,300 casual employees were assisting them in running the bus services. the government, it is learnt, was loosing rs 1 crore revenue everyday in the form of road tax being paid by the corporation in addition to rs 7 crore revenue loss a day to the rtc due to strike. meanwhile, in the wake of the employees continuing the indefinite strike, the apsrtc, with the help of the transport department, has so far recruited about 200 drivers on a temporary basis to ply more buses in hyderabad. the drivers have been selected after scrutinising their licence and conducting a driving test. the rta staff were reportedly picking up drivers from the lorry ""addas"" like afzalgunj and bowenpally to run buses. with the new recruits having little experience in driving on the city roads, road accidents were reported at some places. when contacted, rtc regional manager (city region) ch rameshwar rao said the corporation was facing a 'war-like situation' and in which ""such minor incidents are bound to happen."" he said the corporation was trying its best to make sure that only roadworthy drivers were allowed to drive the buses. most of the truck and lorry drivers who have been selected by the rtc were locals and had experience of driving on the city roads. these drivers also have to undergo a driving test conducted by the rta,rao said. the city region operated 665 buses out of its 1,700-strong fleet on wednesday. meanwhile, cpi state secretary suravaram sudhakar reddy, in statement accused the chief minister of treating the strike as a political crisis instead of a genuine problem. sudhakar reddy told naidu that ""there is a severe deficiency in your thought. instead of trying to identify the root cause of the problem, you look at them from a political standpoint. instead of solving problem, you try to use force and suppress agitators. you are impatient that people are still agitating after you became the chief minister. you believe that your ascent to the post is a great event while anyone who protests is branded as anti-development. this is not a correct approach. instead, have some patience and let us join hands to save the rtc as a public sector unit. instead of thinking like the president of tdp, think as chief minister.""

14,No `bar' on taking your lawyer to task,"bangalore: has your lawyer taken all your money but failed to file your case? has he colluded with your opponent and struck a secret deal or has even refused to return your documents in case you wanted to switch to another lawyer? don't worry. the law says you can move the bar council against your lawyer. ``file a complaint against the advocate and the state bar council will dispose of the case within a year,'' v.t. raya raddi, chairman of the karnataka state bar council, said. the state bar council has lent a ear for more than a hundred cases filed by litigants who have wished to prosecute advocates against professional misconduct this year. this follows rule 35 of the bar council of india which provides for the right to reprimand, suspend the advocate from practice for a period deemed fit, or even remove the name of the advocate from the state roll of advocates. accordingly, two advocates in the state were suspended from practice recently on grounds of professional misconduct in the last two months. nearly 10 advocates were warned recently. the cases that have been brought to light to the disciplinary committee of the state bar council are land acquisition cases, cheques being signed in favour of advocate instead of the client, no confidence in the advocate etc. if the matter is not resolved within a year, it is to be referred to the bar council of india. ``under the advocates' act, 163 complaints against advocates were disposed of during 2000-2001 while another 150 cases are pending,'' sources said. however, harried litigants feel that approaching the bar council by lodging a complaint is asking for more trouble. ``it's tough to fight cases against advocates, who are well versed with the law,'' they opine. the consumer forum and the civil courts do address cases against advocates. ``but since litigants feel finicky about hiring an advocate against another, a number of cases being filed in these fora are almost nil,'' point out advocates. in order to channelise their objectives on checking professional misconduct of advocates, the bar council of india has put on alert, the advocate fraternity by ruling that lawyers cannot practice if they are full-time salaried employees in the government sector. ``the bar council has despatched notices to eight law officers of the bangalore city corporation this year. and there is more to follow,'' said raddi.

18,Tribals' stir: Activist sees Janu-govt nexus,"kozhikode: dr nalla thambi thera, the first physician-camaigner for tribals' rights in kerala, has alleged a ""conspiracy"" between the ruling udf and a tribal leader c k janu in the recently concluded tribals' stir for restoration of their alienated lands. the 48-day-old agitation under the leadership of janu ended last week with a victory procession and feast. the stir was called off after the antony government assured the tribals that all those homeless adivasis would get land ranging from one to five acres each. dr thera, who had fought in the court the land alienation case for well over two decades, said the recent agitation was ""sponsored, financed, and guided by the udf government in collusion with the vested interests"". he alleged that the stir was a cover to give validity to the tribal land act 1999 which aimed at ""rehabilitating"" tribals, not ""restoring"" their land. in other words, the rich and powerful settlers from the plains were to gain from the legislation. the high court had earlier struck down the act as unconstitutional and improper, but the government has moved the apex court. earlier, a similar bill was returned by the president. dr thera claimed to have the information that the government had in its posesssion 1.20 lakh acres of vested forests land which again are being used by rich and influential people. ""if this land is immediately taken up, the tribal problem would have been solved"".
