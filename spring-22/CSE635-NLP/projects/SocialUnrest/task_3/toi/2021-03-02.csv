0,Excise raid at 19 farmhouses,"NEW DELHI: The excise department of the Delhi government raided 19 farmhouses in Vasant Kunj, in south west Delhi and Narela and Alipur in north west Delhi over the weekend for violating various excise laws.

""Out of these, six farmhouses had violated excise laws. The department will take action against them,"" said Delhi excise commissioner Ranbir Singh, .

The farmhouses have been raided following a policy decision taken by the government that farmhouses be allowed to hold commercial parties after requisite permission from the MCD.

Farmhouses have to pay a misuse charge of Rs 40,000 to the MCD and also apply for permission to hold commercial functions.

""After the order, we decided to step up checking of the farmhouses,"" said Singh. ""The MCD has not yet started the permission process, but we were getting reports of commercial functions being held at these farmhouses,"" added Singh. ""The raids were conducted to prevent large-scale violations of the law,"" he said.

Four of the farmhouses raided were serving liqour without requisite permission, while two others had charges of technical violations.

""Two of these farmhouses had taken an L-49(A) licence, that is, permission to serve liqour in a party or function anywhere in Delhi except public parks, under false names,"" said an excise official.

In fact, the raiding party recovered liqour from the neighbouring state of Haryana and also from a defence canteen at one of the farmhouses.

""We have therefore booked these farmhouses for serving smuggled liqour as well,"" said the excise official.

With the notification of Lok Sabha election, the excise department will step up enforcement activities to prevent smuggling of liquor into the city, said Singh. ""We have already started co-ordinating with the police on enforcement drives,"" he said.

1,NBW against lawyer in ex-CJI case,"NEW DELHI: A city court issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against lawyer R Karuppan, who allegedly made false statements before the Supreme Court regarding the age of former Chief Justice of India A S Anand.

Chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) Reena Singh Nag on Monday ordered the DCP (special cell) to execute the warrant against Karuppan by March 8.

This, however, is not the first NBW against him as earlier CMMs had also issued warrants against him. The court had earlier issued a notice to the DCP (special cell), asking him why the accused had not been produced before the court despite repeated orders.

Karuppan''s allegation that Anand had falsified his age had raised a storm. The SC had directed the registrar-general to file a complaint under section 193 of the IPC against him.

On August 29, 2003, the then CMM K S Pal had issued an NBW against Karuppan.

Earlier, an NBW issued by the CMM had been returned intimating that Karuppan had been given a respite by the Chennai HC till August 23 on the condition that he would appear in a magistrate''s court at Chennai.
