0,Rupee stages mild rally against $,"mumbai: the rupee staged a mild rally against the greenback on friday on late exporter dollar sales and unwinding of long positions by banks ahead of the weekend. in generally quiet and range-bound trade at the interbank foreign exchange (forex) market, the rupee closed at 47.1500/1550 per dollar, marginally higher from the overnight finish of 47.1550/1600. opening on a weak note at 47.16/17, the rupee traded within a narrow band of 47.15 and 47.17 in directionless and muted business. exporter dollar sales and unwinding of long positions by banks in late trade helped the rupee post minor gains against the dollar in a market that lacked clear direction, dealers said. ""absence of adequate follow-up demand for dollars, led banks to offload long positions even as exporters brought in their receivables and gave the rupee slight underlying support,"" a dealer said. ""many unwound long dollar positions ahead of the weekend to avoid the high carryover costs,"" he added. marketmen expect the rupee to remain stable when trade opens next monday, but the general outlook seems somewhat bearish for the currency. the reserve bank of india (rbi) fixed the reference rate at 47.16 per dollar, as against 47.18 on thursday. in cross currency trades, the rupee ended barely changed against the euro, but still remained firmly entrenched against the single european unit. it continued to strengthen against the british sterling. the indian currency ended little changed against the single european unit at 40.29/31 per euro from thursday's finish of 40.28/30 after opening around 40.18/21. resuming on a firm footing against sterling at 66.22/24 per euro from 66.36/38, the rupee shot up further at the close to 66.08/10 per euro. the futures market was very volatile in contrast to the quiet spot trade and forward dollar premiums moved erratically either-way on alternate bout of forward dollar sales and bids. premium moved in tandem with the domestic money market and renewed speculation of a rate cut - initially premiums rose sharply in line with high call rates, fell on renewed receiving interest and later again rose on paying pressure, dealers said.

2,"`Previous govt fiddled, while Kerala burned'","thiruvananthapuram: the antony government has, while presenting its maiden budget on friday, avenged its humiliation at the hands of the governor, s.s. kang. kang had inexplicably omitted an important political portion from the governor's address to the assembly. the portion was highly critical of the erstwhile left front (ldf) government. even after furore from the ruling udf, the raj bhavan chose to be silent on whether the omission was accidental or intentional. finance minister k. sankaranarayanan set aside a good-eight pages of the 63-page budget speech and 20 minutes to berate the earlier ldf government. almost comparing the ldf to emperor nero, the finance minister said the cpm-led government indulged in ""borrow at will, spend merrily, and leave the rest to posterity"". ""no responsible government should behave like this. if it was a household, it would have had to commit suicide. and yet, the previous ldf government went on enriching its own camp and made the state poorer,"" he said. however, cpm leaders regretted that the antony government instead of abusing the ldf should have directed its ire at the bjp-led centre which was mainly responsible for the ills the states.

4,"Guidelines for advisors, bidders for disinvestment","new delhi: government on friday announced guidelines for advisors and bidders for disinvestment in psus and is likely to issue show-cause notices to hindujas, videocon, sterlite and credit suisse first boston (csfb) for their alleged involvement in various offences. the guidelines follow a decision taken to this effect by the cabinet committee on disinvestment (ccd) last week for keeping the tainted companies out of the process of disinvestment. when contacted, disinvestment ministry officials said that show-cause notices would be issued soon to hindujas, who have bid for both indian airlines and air india, videocon which has bid for indian airlines and vsnl and sterlite, who are in the race for hindustan zinc ltd and hindustan copper. notices would also be issued to csfb, who are the advisors for vsnl privatisation, officials said on condition of anonymity. while hindujas have been chargesheeted in the bofors case, videocon and sterlite have been named by the securities and exchange board of india (sebi). after getting their replies, government would decide whether these could be qualified for continuation in the privatisation process, they said. as per the guidelines, ""any conviction in a court of law or indictment/adverse order by a regulatory authority for a grave offence against the advising concern and its sister concerns would constitute a disqualification"". regarding bidders, the guidelines said ""in relation to matters other than the security and integrity of the country, any conviction or indictment/adverse order by a regulatory authority that constitutes doubt on the ability of the bidder to manage the psu when it is disinvested"" would be a disqualification. on security issues, the guidelines said any chargesheet by an agency of government/conviction by a court of law for an offence committed by the bidding partner or by any of its sister concern would result in disqualification. a decision on the relationship with sister concern would be taken on the basis of relevant facts and after examining whether the two concerns are substantially controlled by the same person or persons. this assumes significance in the wake of protests by the confederation of indian industry (cii) that ashok leyland consortium, that bid for air india and indian airlines, should not be debarred. hindujas have controlling stakes in ashok leyland. the disqualification for both bidders and advisors would continue for a period that government deems appropriate, disinvestment minister arun shourie said in a statement. disqualification criteria would come into immediate effect and apply to all bidders for various disinvestment transactions, the government said. a show-cause notice would be issued in each case to give the bidders and advisors an opportunity to explain their positions. government said any disqualified entity would not be allowed to remain associated with the disinvestment process just because of a pending appeal against the order based on which it has been disqualified. ""the mere pendency of appeal will have no effect on disqualification"", it said. the grave offence for disqualification is being defined to be of such a nature that it outrages the moral sense of the community. ""the decision in regard to the nature of offence would be taken on case to case basis after considering facts of the case and relevant legal principles of the government"", it said.

11,'Operation Daman' to enforce dry law in Surat,"surat: beware worshippers of bacchus. the prohibition and excise department of surat division will conduct 'operation daman' at frequent intervals to check the trafficking of hard liquor in the city and other parts of south gujarat. prompted by the success of the two-week 'operation daman' last month in which 517 cases were registered and 532 people arrested, the surat division covering the south gujarat area, has planned to hold such exercises regularly. proximity to daman attracts residents there, for among other reasons the easy availability of hard liquor, that too at a low price compared to mumbai and elsewhere. according to deputy commissioner of police, prohibition, i m desai, out of 517 cases, 237 related to bootlegging and 19,099 bottles along with several vehicles, worth over rs 69 lakhs were seized during the operation carried over a fortnight from may 30. all the 15 points on the border between south gujarat and daman, were sealed and checking made on incoming vehicles and those persons entering the state in an inebriated state, desai informed. when asked, he said for such a massive exercise involving continuous vigil, personnel from prohibition department and other divisions had been requisitioned, along with companies of srp. the operation would have continued but for the rathyatra in june last week, for which the srp personnel had to be sent back. desai said. but, with the help of the prohibition staff, the exercise is continuing but at times it is hard to keep the whole stretch under constant watch. whatever strength they have in terms of the number of personnel the attempt is to instil fear among bootleggers and also among those who think that getting drunk there and then returning back would be anything but not an offence, desai narrated. in recent months, the bootlegging was carried out on a massive scale from daman to surat and other parts of south gujarat. those involved in this illegal trafficking had in fact been in very in their whole modus operandi and in two separate cases sometime back had even thrashed two constables of the prohibition department near pardi in valsad. both of them later had succumbed to their injuries in the hospitals. it had become absolutely essential to have 'operation daman' type of exercise, primarily to instil a fear among bootleggers and also to enforce a blanket ban on all sort of trafficking in hard liquor through the porous points on the border. for making the enforcement exercises more extensive, the heads of the prohibition and excise departments are to attend a meeting being convened on july 19 at gandhinagar, where several measures in regard to enforcement of prohibition would be discussed.
