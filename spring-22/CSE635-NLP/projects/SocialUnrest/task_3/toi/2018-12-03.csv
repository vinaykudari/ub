9,"Rabri called DGP, admits party","patna: the controversy over the ''threatening telephone call'' to jharkhand director-general of police (dgp) t.p. sinha allegedly by bihar chief minister rabri devi deepened on friday when the rjd spokesman admitted that rabri had telephoned the dgp on november 26 while the cm denied the dgp's allegation that she had threatened him over the phone. the rjd demanded a cbi inquiry into the dgp's functioning, accusing him of ''patronising the coal mafia'' in the dhanbad region of jharkhand. while talking to an private tv channel on friday, rabri said: ''why should i talk to the dgp? nobody will believe that i talked to the dgp. ''if i have to complain, i will talk to marandi or atal bihari vajpayee directly,'' she maintained. rjd spokesman and bihar excise minister shivanand tiwari, however, admitted on friday that rabri had telephoned the dgp on november 26 requesting him to ensure adequate security at the camp jail in ranchi where her husband, laloo prasad yadav, is lodged. the dgp's allegation that rabri ''threatened'' him and his family members was false and baseless, tiwari said adding that the dgp ''indulged'' in such acts either to get extension or to secure a ''plum post'' after his retirement which is due in january 2002. mp sinha, one of the dgp's brothers, in his interview with a private tv channel here on friday, said rabri had rung up the dgp and accused him of ''being involved in the conspiracy that landed her husband in jail'' in ranchi on november 26. two of his brothers were with the dgp in ranchi when the ''telephonic conversation'' took place, sources said. mp sinha said rabri asked the dgp to provide proper facilities to laloo during his stay in jail. the dgp tried to convince her that it was the job of the jail department. when he called his family at kadamkuan in patna around midnight on the same day, he was told that on the same night, a bihar police team had barged into his residence on the pretext of carrying out a security check. the policemen asked the security guards posted there to report to the police line for duty, the dgp's brother informed. in its internal report, the central intelligence agency confirmed the ''veiled threat'' allegedly given by rabri to the jharkhand dgp during the telephonic conversation, sources said. the sources, however, maintained that the centre had so far not ordered any formal inquiry in this regard. the jharkhand government has already sent the dgp's letter to union home minister l.k. advani. the rjd spokesman along with bihar law minister shakeel ahmad khan demanded t p sinha's removal as dgp to ensure a ''free and fair'' inquiry. they alleged that the dgp was ''in league'' with the coal mafia which ''helped'' him bag the top police post. the rjd spokesman has also written a letter to advani on friday seeking cbi probe. he also sent some ''documents'' to advani to ''corroborate'' his allegations and accused the dgp of ''misusing'' his office to save his close relative deepak lala whose company, messrs basanti mata hard coke enterprises, was jointly raided by the cisf and local police at barwadda in dhanbad in 1999 in which steam coal and hard coke worth rs 15 lakh were reportedly recovered. tiwari alleged that the dgp used his official position to suppress the matter by influencing the cisf and police personnel.

12,All-party meeting on terror law today,"new delhi: in the face of a sustained opposition assault on the prevention of terrorism ordinance, prime minister vajpayee agreed to hold an all-party meeting on tuesday. read this story in... amendments to the law could be considered, he told lok sabha. on monday, responding to the storm of protests raised by the opposition over his remarks in hyderabad on sunday, vajpayee denied that he had questioned the patriotism of any social segment. there were opinions that the bill was not strong enough. he, however, favoured a discussion and felt suggestions for change could be considered. the mood for the furore was set as the morning session began, when samajwadi party president mulayam singh yadav and congress chief whip priyaranjan das munshi criticised the pm's hyderabad remarks, terming them ""anti-minority"" and demanding that the question hour be suspended to take up the matter. speaker balayogi, however, did not agree. during zero hour, opposition mps criticised the pm, terming poto as ""draconian"". congress deputy leader in the house shivraj patil said his party needed no lectures on the terrorist menace, since it had paid a heavy price with the lives of its leaders. responding to opposition protests, vajpayee claimed that all he had said in hyderabad was that if the minorities had any apprehension about the new legislation, that could be removed. coming down heavily on mulayam for his demand for suspension of question hour, vajpayee wondered whether he was not bound by the new rules of decorum adopted by the parties. ""by demanding suspension of question hour, he wanted to suggest he was in the forefront of the anti-poto campaign,"" vajpayee angrily remarked. if the congress has any objection, it should communicate that to the government, he said. he pointed out that the tdp, which had supported the ordinance at the chief ministers' meeting, had suggested certain modifications. the government, he said, was willing to discuss the opposition views on the bill.

15,Terror law to be tabled with some changes,"new delhi: the battlelines on poto are drawn and there doesn't seem much chance the opposition will relent on it. the government strategy is now to introduce in the lok sabha, most probably on december 13, an amended version of the bill-which will take care of the concerns of some of its nda partners that it could be used against the press and political parties-to ensure their support for it. for instance, in the section referring to the ""duty of a citizen"" to bring to the notice of the authorities any information connected with terrorist activities, journalists and doctors may be given exemption along with lawyers, government sources said. after getting the bill passed in the lok sabha, the government will then decide whether to allow it to be defeated in the rajya sabha in the closing week of the current session or keep ""quiet"". either way, the bjp will then make it a campaign issue in the assembly polls coming up in february next year, particularly the one in uttar pradesh, presenting the opposition as a collection of anti-national parties. the option of a joint session of both houses- in which the bjp-led coalition has a majority- remains, but government sources said there are mixed feelings on what that would achieve, and whether simply ramming the bill through would not take the sting out of its electoral campaign. the government also has the option of repromulgating the ordinance if it doesn't bring it to the rajya sabha- as was done in the case of an ordinance on the management of sapru house- but the consensus is that it would ""not be proper"" to do that. besides, as a senior minister put it, ""the ordinance is not the issue"", it is to make a political point."" meanwhile, the government decided it will hold on tuesday the all-party meeting that had been promised by the prime minister, more as a matter of form, rather than with any expectation that any consensus will emerge from the deliberations, senior government sources stressed. vajpayee, however, made a last ditch effort in the lok sabha on monday to be conciliatory when he admitted indirectly that perhaps the government should have consulted the opposition before it had promulgated the ordinance and that it was still open to suggestions. but it does not seem to have cut much ice, with congress spokesperson s.jaipal reddy reiterating his party's opposition to poto. the decision to hold the all-party meeting on tuesday came after a meeting at the pm's residence on monday morning at which l k advani and pramod mahajan were present.

20,Sonia won't attend Pawar's birthday party,"new delhi: congress president sonia gandhi will not be accepting the invitation for ncp leader sharad pawar's 61st birthday party in mumbai on december 12. the invitation, extended to sonia by a broad-based organising committee headed by former prime minsiter chandra shekhar and handed over by pawar's confidante praful patel, has been politely declined. ""the congress president has received an invitation for the party... she gets several such invitations. but her schedule is such that she will not be able to attend pawar's birthday party,"" congress spokespeson s.jaipal reddy told reporters here on monday. pawar's presence at cpm leader somnath chatterjee's famous ""unity dinner"" last week had generated considerable speculation in political circles about a larger opposition unity. this was particularly so as the dinner was soon followed by an invitation to sonia for pawar's birthday party. however, all talk of larger opposition unity was quickly brushed aside by pawar who publicely stated that he had not invited sonia for his birthday party and that the invitation was sent by the organising committee. he also maintained that though he had attended somnath chatterjee's dinner, he had not spoken to sonia. he further stated that his objection to her foreign origins were still valid. he also ruled out the possibility of his attending the congress party's iftar party, slated for december 11, in case of an invitation being sent to him. it is also unlikely that pawar will figure in the congress party's guest list for its iftar party. senior congress leaders had earlier indicated that invitations would be sent out to leaders of all non-nda, whichincludes pawar and the samajwadi party leaders mulayum singh yadav and amar singh. the sp leaders may be invited for the congress iftar but congress leaders said this would now depend upon whether sonia is invited to the samajwadi party's iftar on december 5.

21,Share buyback law passed in RS,"new delhi: on a sedate and productive day, the rajya sabha on monday cleared all bills on agenda and told the ministers in charge of law and justice and the central public works department to focus on reforms in both areas. a law was passed which removed the procedural necessity of going to court to give effect to a christian will of succession. laws allowing firms greater leeway in buying back shares from the market and to extend the coverage of welfare measures for cinema-house employees were also among the measures approved. some obsolete laws, such as the one for dividing the pre-1947 property and assets of the st john ambulance between indian and pakistan, were cleared for removal from the statute book. the companies' buyback law was the only one where the opposition was critical of the government's move and intention, demanding to know the necessity of having issued an ordinance to this effect in late october, thus bypassing pre-enactment scrutiny from parliament's committees. arun jaitley, the minister in charge, gave an able defence for the government. jaitley also went on to list the government's efforts to speed judicial reforms ^ `fast-track' special courts, time-limits for pronouncing judgments after hearing, judges visiting jails directly to hear undertrials etc ^ when members sought more details on a query tabled on this subject. they were especially concerned at the slow hearings of undertrials, who form the bulk of a jail's populace and are the subject of most pending criminal cases. jaitley reiterated the government's wish to establish a statutory panel to decide on the appointment of judges and allied matters, a ticklish issue with the judiciary. of 1,734 sanctioned `fast track' courts, around 860 have been notified, he said. members also took the cpwd to task for poor maintenance of government buildings. minister anant kumar gave various assurances. the cpwd's functioning has been criticised by the comptroller and auditor general and the parliament's standing committees, in recent years.

23,Modi flays Cong bid to thwart unanimous selection,"vadodara: chief minister narendra modi came down heavily on the congress for its attempts to force polls in villages trying to have unanimously elected candidates to village panchayats. the city unit of the bjp, meanwhile, capitalised on modi's visit by conducting a handsome rally in a show of strength. modi, who was in the city for the first time after taking over as cm, addressed a convention of district bjp unit workers at tarsali. he used the opportunity to come down heavily on the congress and hard sell the samras concept of giving monetary incentive to village panchayats which selected unanimous representatives. modi said: ""the congress seems to be adopting a divide-and-rule policy in the villages for political gains. it is trying to force elections in villages which have decided to adopt the policy."" he blamed congress of adopting double standards over the issue. ""in 1992, the congress had come up with the idea of giving incentives to gram panchayats which had unanimously elected representatives. now they seem to have forgotten it, and are bent on ensuring polls at any cost,"" modi said. he pointed out that election rivalries in villages were deep-rooted, and even lead unpleasant consequences. ""this cannot be allowed to continue. instead, villagers can strive for development by having unanimity,"" he said. modi observed that it would be wrong to say that samras was a bjp programme, and added: ""the slogan was given by vinoba bhave, and sarvoday leaders worked for it."" the chief minister said he was not averse to the idea of congress representatives being selected unanimously to village panchayats. ""let anybody get elected unanimously, but at least do it,"" he said. meanwhile, city unit workers of bjp took out a rally through the city with modi greeting the citizens. the cm moved with the rally from the airport to tarsali village. representatives of various areas greeted him on route to the venue for the party convention. the cm also kicked off the state-wide intensive pulse polio vaccination drive by administering the vaccine to a child in a school in the gita mandir area of the city.

""a final decision is awaited,"" he added, however. pandya did not elaborate the reasons, but ministers close to modi told tnn that the party had carried out a survey of eight constituencies, and found that ""kutiana was the safest"". the last on the list of the survey is dhandhuka in ahmedabad district, from where bjp media chairman bharat pandya is an mla. others considered included morbi, patan and two ahmedabad city constituencies. babubhai bokhiria _ who belongs to a backward class like modi, and is from porbandar _ was one of the most important promotees among ministers when modi formed his cabinet in october. when contacted, bokhiria said the cm would ""surely win the poll hands down from kutiana if he fights from there,"" but refused to confirm whether modi was going to porbandar to sense the mood. bokhiria denied that criminal elements in kutiana, especially those belonging to the notorious santokhba jadeja gang, might create trouble there. ""the gangsters are lying low. bhura munjha, a santokhba relative, got a mere 4,000 votes when he contested from porbandar. his wife was defeated by 20,000 votes in kutiana by the bjp's karsanbhai odedhra,"" he said.
