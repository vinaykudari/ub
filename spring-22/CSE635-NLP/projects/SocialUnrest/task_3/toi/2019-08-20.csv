1,Gorakhpur bandh turns violent,"GORAKHPUR: Supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party MP Yogi Adityanath went berserk in the city on Monday, setting afire a sleeper coach of Jammu Tawi Express, a bus of the UP State Road Transport Corporation and a motorcycle.

However, the call for the city bandh given by the BJP MP evoked a partial response on Monday. Though most of the markets and educational institutions remained closed in the main city, the life on the outskirts was normal.

Some persons, who were trying to force closure of shops in Mohaddipur area, were arrested by police. Earlier, supporters of the BJP MP visited different city localities to direct shopkeepers to keep their shutters down. They also forced closure of petrol pumps in the city. However, hotels and picture halls remained unaffected.

The bandh supporters burnt a bus of the Rapti Nagar depot near the government polytechnic here and damaged two other buses. The miscreants also set a sleeper coach of the Jammu Tawi Express (No 68328) on fire.

Talking to Times News Network, chief PRO of the NE Railway said that a three-member inquiry committee, comprising chief safety officer (CSO), chief rolling store engineer (CRSE) and chief electrical engineer (CEE), had been set up to probe the fire incident.

Meanwhile, workers of the Samajwadi Party (SP) took out a silent procession under the leadership of district president Gopal Yadav from the party office in protest against the city bandh. Addressing a public meeting held here, speakers blamed Adityanath for creating communal tension in the city.

They also presented a memorandum to district authorities demanding immediate release of the party workers. The memorandum was addressed to the president of India. Later, the SP workers were arrested for defying the Section 144.

They were, however, released after some time.State president of the Loktantrik Congress and former minister Hari Shankar Tiwari also urged the district administration to deal firmly with communal forces.

2,Bara Banki incident is a conspiracy: Mayawati,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawati described the incident that occurred in Asandara in Bara Banki on Sunday as a conspiracy of opposition parties to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere and create terror among the people of the state.

She said that the entire incident was well-planned by certain local politicians who had incited the people to defame the government.

Referring to reports received from Bara Banki, she said there occurred no incident related to the much publicised ''muhnochwaâ€™ and the kachcha baniyan gang of criminals in the district during the past two months.

She said there was no reason for a ''gheraoâ€™ of the police station when the CO Ramsanehi Ghat and the SDM had assured the people of regular patrolling.

The chief minister claims that the local administration has clarified that the police resorted to firing to disperse the unruly mob and had aimed below the waist.

The body of the person killed in the incident was found about 100 metres away from the troubled spot and the cause of his death is expected to be known after the post-mortem examination.

She said that in the backdrop of the Asandara incident, her governmentâ€™s drive against criminals has unnerved the Samajwadi Party which is trying to instil terror among the people.

â€œThe incident was organised by the local MP by mobilising the crowd from the local market to wreck the law and order to defame the governmentâ€�, she alleged.

3,New transport policy likely by October,"NEW DELHI: Delhi state government is likely to formulate a transport policy by October 2, 2002. The policy will have a fresh citizensâ€™ charter and performance standards for the transport services.

Delhi state transport minister Ajay Maken termed it as the â€˜operational planâ€™ for the changing transport scenario, which will emerge by year 2021 in the city. He disclosed this on Monday at a two-day meet.

â€˜â€˜We have brought together policy makers, major service-providers, users, financial institutions, academicians, thinkers and regulators on a common platform to determine the most practical solutions in the short and long term,â€™â€™ said transport commissioner Sindhushree Khullar.

Maken in his inaugural address said, â€˜â€˜I took charge of the ministerial portfolio on December 6 and as if to mark my taking over, the Supreme Court issued directions for transport sector.â€™â€™

Over judicial intervention on CNG, Maken said, â€˜â€˜The Supreme Court had in fact activated the state government to strive for better transport and environment in the Capital.â€™â€™

Khullar, while giving an overview of the cityâ€™s existing transport scenario, said, â€˜â€˜We thought of evolving an operational plan, taking into account the changing circumstances so that citizens can have a clean, safe, comfortable and affordable transport system.â€™â€™

The sessions will continue through Tuesday, and again on September 5 and 6.

4,Hospital equipment worth crores sold as junk,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state government purchases hospital equipment worth several crores every year. But not many machines outlive their utility. Some others work only for a few months. Eventually, these expensive machines are sold as junk.

Despite the colossal loss, both hospitals and the government which use these machines escape accountability. The government constituted an equipment procurement cell after several crores of rupees were lost in unjustified purchases in G B Pant Hospital. In all, items worth Rs 86 crore were involved in these purchases which either expired or were not used.

In 1992, a fully automatic blood analyser machine was purchased for Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital but it did not work for more than six months. The machine was bought for Rs 32 lakh. The government constituted an inquiry into the matter.

Principal secretary (health) S P Aggarwal said, â€˜â€˜If we purchase a machine which cannot be used and is allowed to rust, we will have to fix responsibility on someone.â€™â€™ The inquiryâ€™s results are yet to be made public.

In Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, a CT scan machine was purchased in late 1980s. The machine worked for six years even though it would break down every now and then. Finally, a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by a patient who was unable to get a CT scan done.

The hospital authorities decided to sell the machine and buy a new one, but without much success. An official said, â€˜â€˜The government wanted to sell the old machine for Rs 18 lakh. Obviously, nobody wanted to give that kind of money for a piece of junk.â€™â€™

5,Centre rapped for policy on disabled,"NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has ordered the Union government to constitute medical authorities for granting certificates to the physically challenged as required under the disability Act.

In a public interest litigation (PIL) on the issue, a division Bench comprising Chief Justice S B Sinha and Justice A K Sikri recently directed the ministry of health and ministry of social justice to stop passing the buck and issue a formal notification for the formation of medical authorities with immediate effect so that the physically challenged are no longer deprived of the benefits they are entitled to under the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities and Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act of 1995.

The court expressed concern that for six years the government had not taken the step. The PIL was filed by a lawyersâ€™ group â€” Social Jurists.

While directing the government to bring out the notification, the Bench said: â€˜â€˜The government is also directed to give wide publicity to the constitution of aforesaid medical authorities by using electronic as well as print media so that the disabled persons who need the required certificates know from where they can obtain such certificates after getting themselves examined.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜The aforesaid hospitals constituted as medical authorities...should be displayed on the notice board of the hospitals as well as prominent places in the hospital premises,â€™â€™ the Bench said.

The PIL highlighted the governmental apathy toward the cause reflected in its failure to create full-fledged medical boards from where the physically challenged could get the certificate and avail benefits.

Under the Act, the government is duty-bound to create medical boards for the assessment of disability and proportion of benefits to be awarded to the person.

The court had taken up the hearings on priority after it was requested that a protracted litigation would prolong the suffering of the physically challenged.

The PIL stated nearly two lakh physically challenged people were facing difficulty in getting medical certificate from the government for the purpose of employment, relief or admission to educational institutions.

Talks with IBM have been concluded and we are awaiting their final decision, CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Monday.GE has assured that Kolkata will be top-of-themind for their next call centre in India. Negotiations are also on with Spectramind (a Wipro subsidiary) to nominate Kolkata as the next call centre. TCS Cognizant Technologies and PwC are expected to diversify into business process outsourcing as well, he said.McKinsey has already held meetings with 36 investors while scouting for investment. Of these 13 proposals are being seriously followed. Over the next three months, the team plans to meet 30 more investors that have evinced interest in opening new centres over the next one year.Bhattacharjee was speaking during the launch of an IT-enabled services policy which accords public utility services status under Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 to the sector in view of its 24x7x365 (round-the-clock, around-the-year) operations.Exemptions have been offered to ITES firms to allow women to work all night. A fiscal incentive package has also been announced. The IT policy announced in 2000 is being updated.He said the policy would enable West Bengal to vie for a spot in the top three IT states by 2010. Unveiling the policy, Bhattacharjee said it would help the state garner 15-20 per cent of the country's ITES business by the end of this decade.Nasscom pegs ITES revenue at Rs 100,000 crore by 2010 with employment for 30 million professionals. Going by these projections, West Bengal will aim for revenues of Rs 15,000 crore and employment for 4.5 million professionals in eight years.At present, 70 IT companies including 27 ITES firms are operating in West Bengal against 24 in Andhra Pradesh. However, the number of call centre seats stand at a meagre 500. The number is expected to double as Vision Computex (a division of Nexgenix of US), Jayshree Infotech (a BK Birla Group company) and BNK set up call centres in two years.Though Bengal focused on the IT sector only in 1997-98, it has recorded a compounded average growth rate of 115 per cent in five years from 1996 to 2001, Bhattacharjee said.

7,2 arrested in Mumbai triple murder case,"KOLKATA: The trail of a sensational triple murder in Mumbai ended in Kolkata on Sunday night with the arrest of two of the key accused by the detective department of Kolkata police.

Deputy commissioner (detective department) Soumen Mitra said the murders were a result of a tale of molestation and revenge.

On February 21, this year, Mohammed Sanaulla, Mohammed Mazhar and Sheikh Babloo were brutally murdered at the Gujarat guest house in the Bhindi Bazar area in south Mumbai. They were clubbed to death and their throats were also slashed.

The Mumbai Police, while investigating the murders, learnt that the victims and assailants came from Bangali bustee in Garden Reach, Kolkata.

â€œThe Mumbai Police came here four times and carried out raids in Garden Reach with the help of local police station, but their raids drew a blank. Eventually, they requested the detective department to help them,â€� Mitra said.

On Sunday night, police arrested Mustaq Ahmed and Afsar Alam Rizvi, two of the three alleged assailants, with their two girl-friends, Rani and Mithu.

They were found in the house of one Shahzad Ali Sheikh at Nalgora under Baruipur police station in North 24 Parganas. The third accused, Sauqat Ali, is absconding.

The two men have reportedly confessed to the crime. Ahmed and Rizvi said that they used to stay with Rani and Mithu, two Mumbai bar dancers, at Ali Hossain Hotel in Dharavi. The three victims - Sanaulla, Mazhar and Babloo - who were old acquaintances of the accused, used to misbehave with the two women.

On February 19, the three victims went to Ali Hosain Hotel and beat up Sauqat Ali, before molesting the two girls. When Mustaq and Rizvi learnt of the incident, they decided to take revenge.

On February 20, they bought heavy hammers and knives from Kurla. The next day they raided the Gujarat Guest House and killed the three men.

Mitra said that all six â€” accused and victims â€” went to Mumbai to earn a living as zari workers. They took to petty crime, like snatching and picking pockets, which was far more lucrative. The two girls were also from Garden Reach who had trained in Mumbai and had even been to Dubai.

8,"Stop rail bifurcation, demand political parties","KOLKATA: Political parties in West Bengal, barring the BJP, consider that splitting the railways into smaller zones will be against the interest of the economy and should not be allowed without consulting a committee of experts on the subject.

Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would meet Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in Delhi early next week and convey this feeling on behalf of the political parties. This was decided at an allparty meeting here on Monday.

The BJP did not attend the meeting. â€œThe main point that emerged in the meeting is that bifurcation of different railway zones into smaller ones will cost the railways a total of Rs 3,500 crore and there is little justification for spending this amount,â€� Bhattacharjee told reporters. â€œI shall go to Delhi next Monday or Tuesday.â€�

Ensuring more safety, better services and setting up of new railway lines should be the priority of the railways, he said. Funds should be better utilised on these, he added.

Because of the largescale application of computers in railway administration, efficient centralised administration was possible. For the Trinamul Congress, the outcome of the meeting was a â€œmoral victoryâ€�.

â€œNothing new was discussed at the meeting. We had earlier demanded an allparty meeting and the setting up of an expert committee,â€� Trinamul state general secretary Partha Chatterjee said.

Chatterjee did not agree that his party had sent a â€œlightweight teamâ€� as he and all-India general secretary Mukul Roy were present.

CPM MP Basudeb Acharya, a member of parliamentary consultative committee on railways, who attended the meeting said Bhattacharjee would also hand over a memorandum to Vajpayee.

If the Centre did not relent, all political parties would meet again and decide on a course of action, he said. Even a bandh could be discussed.

The Congress had earlier suggested that Advani should be greeted with Bangla bandh during his visit to the city in September.

9,DM acts tough to check loot of govt money,"BUXAR: Development works and FIRs go together in the Buxar district. Or so it seems. Named in different FIRs for their alleged involvement in embezzlement of government funds, at least three junior engineers and one block development officer are absconding.

In fact, the move of district magistrate Sandeep Paundrik to check corruption in implementation of development schemes has been giving sleepless nights to the engineers and government officials engaged in execution of development schemes. Paundrikâ€™s message is clear: Either return the embezzled amount or face FIRs.

For example, R P Yadav, a junior engineer who was agent for the construction work of the â€œcentral nullahâ€� at Dumraon, near here, was found guilty of committing irregularities in implementing the Rs 49-lakh scheme following a sample test. Instead of facing legal action, he has chosen the first option; that is, â€œto deposit 10 per cent of the total amount as mentioned in the measurement book registerâ€�.

Sources in the administration disclosed Yadav has already deposited a part of the penalty to be realised from him. DM Paundrik, in his order on August 10, had said that an FIR would be lodged against all the officers concerned, including Dumraon civil SDO Prabhat Shankar, if the erring junior engineer Yadav fails to deposit the amount before August 20.

The block development officer of Chakki, Purushottam Paswan, has been absconding ever since he was named in a case lodged recently with the Brahmpur police station. He has been accused of committing irregularities in the implementation of Poshahar scheme.

The case of another junior engineer Gyanendra Pandey is no different. In an FIR lodged with the Simri police station on June 14, he has been named as accused of committing fraud in the measurement book register meant for the construction work on the Asha-Parari Chhotaka Sinhanpura Road.

Earlier, the SDO, in a report submitted to the DM after making an on-the-spot inquiry, said that he found the soil work done only on 142,715 cubic feet against the 310,950 cubic feet mentioned in the measurement book register.

The FIR, lodged by the SDO on the orders of the DM, alleged it is a case of embezzlement of government money to the tune of Rs 73,086. The police are yet to arrest Pandey, though.

Junior engineer Ganesh Dubey has been accused of committing fraud with the district administration while undertaking the construction work of a school building at Harikishunpur village under the Buxar block.

A sum of Rs 3.62 lakh had been sanctioned from the development quota fund of the then Rajya Sabha member, Nagendra Nath Ojha, for the scheme. However, when an inquiry was conducted at the site by Buxar SDO Ashok Kumar on the DMâ€™s orders, it was found that a petty contractor was appointed by JE Dubey, who was the scheme agent, to execute the same.

The administration then lodged an FIR against both the JE and the contractor, identified as one Kripashankar Choubey, with the Industrial Area police station two days back.

Interestingly, the stern actions taken by the DM have so far not affected the progress of the ongoing development works.

10,"Floods caused huge losses to railway, says minister","DARBHANGA: Union minister for railways Nitish Kumar has said that devastating flood in the north Bihar has caused severe damage to the railway properties.

â€œI am yet to assess the actual damage but the flood situation is more grim than it was in 1987,â€� he said while talking to a section of media here on Sunday.

The minister was on his way to Jhanjharpur to assess the damage caused by the recent floods to the railway properties in this section of North Eastern railway.

Kumar further said that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has already announced, on the eve of Independence Day, an allocation of Rs 15,000 crore under National Railways Development Project.

Four mega railway bridges would be constructed to facilitate the expansion of railway network in the country, he said and added that this includes the construction of a mega bridge on Kosi river between Nirmali and Bhapdiahi.

The railway minister further informed that rail traffic between Darbhanga and Samastipur would be restored by August 24. General manager (NER) and several senior rail officials accompanied the railway minister during his inspection tour.

Kumar said that necessary steps have already been taken to repair a 10-meter deep trench underneath the railway track between Hayaghat and Darbhanga sections. Rail services in this section was disrupted more than a fortnight ago following damage to the track between Hayaghat and Rambhadrapur station.

The proposed Darbhanga-Patna Intercity express, which was scheduled to start running from August 18, would now be flagged off as soon as rail traffic between Samastipur-Darbhanga section returns to normalcy, he said. The intercity train would have three stoppage points at Laheriasarai, Samastipur and Barauni.

11,"Nitish, RJD ministers sing development tune","PATNA: Railway minister Nitish Kumar said that it was on his request that Union human resources development minister Murli Manohar Joshi had agreed to upgrade Bihar College of Engineering, Patna, not only as a Regional Institute of Technology, but also as the National Institute of Technology, if such a proposal came from the Bihar government.

Speaking at a seminar on the Biharâ€™s economic development, organised by the Bihar Industries Association (BIA) here on Monday, he said that since he himself was a product of the BCE, one of the 10 oldest engineering colleges in the country. He wanted it to emerge as a well-developed technical institute in the country.

It is the duty of the state government to create a climate for the stateâ€™s development and get the developmental schemes implemented quickly, he said, and assured all cooperation to the state government as a facilitator of its infrastructural development.

â€œThe need of the hour is to maintain the present congenial atmosphere among the parties and set aside their petty differences to work in tandem for an all-round development of the state.

â€œEven on the special economic package for Bihar, we will have to place â€˜practical aspectsâ€™ before the Centre. We should take the division of Bihar as a challenge and develop the state in a way that those who went to Jharkhand repent it,â€� Kumar said.

He said there would be two rail-cum-road mega bridges of six lanes over the Ganga â€” one in Munger is to be sanctioned soon, and another across Kosi between Nirmali and Bhaptiyahi, whose project report is under preparation. In the East Central (EC) railway with Hajipur as headquarters, the information technology available in Bihar will be utilised, he added.

Water resources minister and convener of the cabinet sub-committee on economic affairs Jagadanand Singh appealed to the stateâ€™s traders and industrialists to make sincere efforts to compete with the products of other states and not to allow Bihar to remain only a consumer state.

He said the flood and poverty had inalienable relation. He stressed on the construction of the Kosi dam to control flood, generate electricity and provide navigation facilities.

Excise minister Shivanand Tiwari called the stateâ€™s bureaucracy as being the main hurdle in development and stressed on improving the administration. Minister for institutional finance Ashok Kumar said developmental works done between 1987 and 2002 had been wasted. No development of the state was possible without controlling floods, he added.

Earlier, BIA president K P S Keshri, in a memorandum submitted to Kumar, said that only 10 per cent of the total 1,737 registered SSI units, 78,334 tiny units and 243 large and medium scale units in the state were working, while 90 per cent had been either closed or were sick. No new investment was being made from outside due to the stateâ€™s â€œpoor imageâ€�. The need of the hour is to first improve the stateâ€™s image.

12,Move HC on J&K polls: SC to Panther's party,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has asked Panther''s Party leader Bhim Singh to move the Delhi or Jammu and Kashmir high court for a direction on the postponement of elections in J&K.

Singh had sought postponement of elections on the grounds that the electoral rolls had not been properly prepared. The Election Commission has ruled out any change in the dates of the four-phased election announced for September-October.

In his petition, Singh contended that due to continued violence in the state, over five lakh voters had not been registered and said there have been anomalies in the electoral rolls.

He said if the EC could postpone the elections in Gujarat due to irregularities in the voters'' list, why the same decision could not be taken in case of J&K.

A Bench, comprising Justice R C Lahoti and Justice Brijesh Kumar, said that there was no reason why the petitioner should not approach the high court under Article 226 of the Constitution and later come to the apex court.

The Bench clarified that it had not expressed any opinion on the maintainability of the petition and if the petitioner filed it before a high court, the latter should hear it on merit uninfluenced by the apex court''s decision not to entertain it.

13,Shekhawat vows to rise above political affiliations,"NEW DELHI: Sworn-in as the country''s 12th vice-president on Monday, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat pledged to ``rise above political affiliations''''.

He will be presiding over the Rajya Sabha where the ruling NDA lacks a majority that is crucial for passing legislations, particularly changes in the Constitution. To this end, he promised to ensure that debates take place in the Rajya Sabha on major issues that concern the country as a whole, besides making efforts to resolve them.

President A P J Abdul Kalam administered the oath of office to 79-year-old Shekhawat at a brief ceremony in Rashtrapati Bhavan. Shekhawat took the oath in Hindi.

The first BJP stalwart to hold this constitutional office, Shekhawat appeared to demonstrate what he meant by being photographed with Prime Minister Vajpayee, leader of the opposition Sonia Gandhi, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah and Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa. He had personally invited Jayalalithaa, taking note of the controversy when she was not invited for the swearing-in of President Kalam. Jayalalithaa''s AIADMK had voted for Shekhawat.

The three-time CM of Rajasthan also had a photo session with his Congress rival and current Rajasthan CM, Ashok Gehlot.

Besides Vajpayee, former President K R Narayanan, three former premiers ^ P V Narasimha Rao, Chandra Shekhar and I K Gujral ^ and Deputy PM L K Advani attended the ceremony. Also present was Sushil Kumar Shinde, the Congress nominee who lost to Shekhawat.

Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee appeared to express her disenchantment with the ruling NDA by sitting among mediapersons. Like he had done during the last cabinet reshuffle, defence minister George Fernandes was once again seen sitting unobstrusively in the last row among the audience.

14,"Meeting between Sinha, Pak counterpart ruled out","NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha travels to Kathmandu on Tuesday for the Saarc ministerial meeting beginning on Wednesday, but official sources rule out the possibility of any meeting between him and Pakistan Foreign Minister Inam-ul-Haq.

The sources said on Monday: ``No such meeting is envisaged.''''

For any dialogue with Pakistan India would have to see an end to infiltration and cross-border terrorism, including a dismantling of the terrorist camps. So far, India had not seen any satisfactory steps and under the circumstances, any dialogue would only be in fructuous.

Pakistan, as the next chairman of Saarc, is expected to suggest dates for the next summit during the Kathmandu meeting but no final decision is expected.

India hopes the Saarc meeting would see a definite push to the agenda of poverty alleviation.

Sinha goes on to Bangladesh from Kathmandu, the first bilateral visit by an Indian foreign minister since the Khaleda Zia government came to power in Bangladesh. Describing it as a goodwill visit, officials said the two countries would discuss trade, water sharing, transit and demarcation of the border.

17,EC directs J&K govt to transfer officials,"SRINAGAR: The Election Commission has directed the Jammu and Kashmir government to transfer all those revenue and police officers who have completed four years at their present places of posting, Deputy Chief Electoral Officer Dheeraj Gupta said on Tuesday.

In a directive to the state government, the EC has ordered transfer of officers of revenue departement above the rank of Tehsildars and police officers above the rank of Station House Officers who have completed a four-year term at the present place of posting with immediate effect, Gupta told reporters.

He said concerned officers have been directed to send a compliance report within two days.

18,Govt delivers another blow to riot victims,"GANDHINAGAR: In continuation with the trend of insensitivity towards riot victims, the Panchmahals district administration has come up with a condition that families of those missing after the riots furnish a solvency certificate of Rs 4.5 lakh to claim the death compensation amount of Rs 1.5 lakh.

The certificate has been sought as the administration fears some of these persons, missing for the last six months, could turn up alive. The issue has raised the hackles of victims who say in many cases their property had also been destroyed in the riots and assets would not add up to Rs 4.5 lakh.

The district development officer of the Panchmahals (Godhra) on Tuesday made public a list of 111 ""missing persons"", asking their family members to forward claims for ""death compensation"". Panchmahals collector Manoj Agrawal is proud that his is the first district that has come up with such a list in a ""transparent manner"". But even before he could actually begin forking out, this hitch has surfaced.

The mamlatdar office says it will give the solvency certificate against an immovable property valued at three times the death compensation amount. Terming it ""gross discrimination"", senior High Court advocate Anmol Sharan of the Centre for Social Justice says, for the ""missing"" of the 2001 earthquake only an indemnity bond was obtained as a guarantee to pay back the compensation in case the missing person was found alive.

""The riots GR not only wants an indemnity bond but also a guarantor and a solvency certificate of the guarantor, thus seeking to delay the whole process,"" he says. On August 9, the taluka development officer of Kalol, on instructions from the district authorities shot letters to the relatives of the ""missing"", saying ""The DDO of Panchmahals has ordered the compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh be paid if a surety and a solvency certificate is submitted.""

Asks Mukhtar Mohammad, organiser of the Kalol relief camp, ""This is ridiculous. How can these paupers organise a guarantee of immovable property worth more than Rs 4.5 lakh to prove each case solvent?""

Mohammad has approached the Chief Relief Coordinator, S M F Bukhari, in Gandhinagar asking him to relax the norm. ""We were told this would mean a policy decision that was in the hands of Chief Minister Narendra Modi,"" he said. He has even sent letters to the president, prime minister and the NHRC.

Says Agrawal, ""We have just begun. But there is no proof of the missing. Hence, some guarantee is needed. Even then we are quite liberal."" While the officials have recognised 111 as ""missing"" in the Panchmahals, independent sources put the figure at 500 for the whole of Gujarat.

19,Ravi hears out partymen's woes,"BANGALORE: Even as the milling crowd of party workers outside the Congress Bhavan on Queens Road created a traffic jam the whole of Tuesday, inside it was meetings galore for AICC general secretary Karnataka in-charge Vayalar Ravi on the second day of his stay.

Workers, who had gathered at the office from early morning in anticipation of a meeting, were, however, not disappointed. Ravi surprised them by arriving before the scheduled time of 10.30 am and visited the computer section which had been inaugurated by party president Sonia Gandhi during the AICC session in April 2001.

``Since many party workers were already present, he asked us to meet him in person. Meetings lasted for a few minutes where we got an opportunity to discuss with him various issues concerning the party,''''a worker said.

One or two memoranda opposed the entry of expelled BJP MLAs into the Congress. ``We want to highlight that we oppose the entry of expelled legislator N. Bharathi Shankar. He or his colleagues will not be loyal to the party as they only party hop. We hope our views would be heard,'''' T.Narasipur Block Congress President S.Mahadevappa said.

A couple of former Congress MLAs from Mysore district had prepared a memorandum highlighting the alleged misdeeds of senior leader Chandraprabha Urs.

After the birth anniversary celebrations of party leaders Rajiv Gandhi and D. Devaraj Urs, he was closeted in a KPCC office bearers meeting for nearly an hour. Apparently, many office bearers expressed their strong reservation against new entrants to Congress getting plum ministries. Besides, they also pointed out that ministers hardly coordinated with district units of the party.

``They hardly visit the party office and participate in party work. How can the party grow if ministers do not show interest in strengthening the party?,'''' a few office bearers reportedly told the meeting. However, ministers guilty of neglecting party work were not named.

20,"Except in city, college bandh total","BANGALORE: For the second consecutive day, response to the school/college bandh was poor in Bangalore on Tuesday while it was ``100 per cent successful'''' in other parts of Karnataka.

The bandh was successful in Mysore, Mandya, Hassan, Tumkur, Raichur, Bellary, Gulbarga, Udupi, Belgaum, Hubli-Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri, Davanagere and other districts.

Basavaraj Horatti, the Karnataka State Private Educational Institutions'' Management Coordination Committee president and MLC, is rushing to Bangalore on Wednesday to ensure that private aided institutions here participate in the bandh.

``Except Bangalore, the response has been very good in other parts of the state. I will try to get support in Bangalore too and ensure there is a good response,'''' Horatti told this paper from Belgaum.

One of the main demands of the managements is lifting the three-year ban on recruitment of high school teachers in aided institutions. Though Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.K. Chandrashekar has maintained that a government order lifting the ban had been issued, the managements contend that bureaucratic hurdles still remain.

The coordination committee will meet in Bangalore on August 25, a day before the meeting convened by Chandrashekar. ``I received the meeting notice today. If the government responds positively at the meeting, we will call off the strike. Otherwise, the coordination committee will decide on the future course of action,'''' Horatti said.

Some of the other demands include: withdrawing the order issued to recover notional increments, extend financial aid to all private educational institutions opened till 1992 as against only SC/ST-run institutions and stop discrimination between government and aided institutions.

Apparently, the coordination committee is ``happy'''' with the primary education department''s initiatives in meeting the demands, but is cut up with the higher education department for not responding to the bandh call and insisting on 15 per cent cut in budgetary allocation to the sector.

21,Airtel hopes to rule waves,"PUNE: While admitting that subscribers experienced problems in the period following its launch, senior officials of Bharti Airtel, in charge of Maharashtra and Goa circle operations, have nevertheless expressed confidence about achieving substantial growth.

Airtel officials say the teething problems of activation and customer care have been sorted out completely by restructuring the related software programme.

â€œAlthough the company had anticipated a good response, the numbers were overwhelming and beyond expectations,â€� said Inder Bajaj, chief operating officer (COO), Airtel. The company hired 70 people to prepare a new software that enables bulk provisioning of connections, he said.

Bajaj said Airtel will soon offer special reduced rates for youths in the night in an attempt to cash in on their â€œactive night lifeâ€� in bigger cities and towns of Maharashtra and Goa.

Bajaj said the companyâ€™s 25 outlets in the state are now capable of activating connections in retail within half-anhour.

Just in case the burden is voluminous, the company is ready with bulk provisioning through the back-end to avoid inconvenience experienced in the beginning of the service, he added.

Reacting to complaints of no network coverage in interior parts of the state, Bajaj said the company is researching the places frequently visited by its customers so that it can be covered by Airtelâ€™s towers.

â€œThe charges that Airtel is not interested in covering economically low-profile areas is false,â€� he said, adding that the Airtel net has covered 45 towns, 18 district headquarters and two major highways in the first phase itself.

He said that with full roaming facility across western India, Airtel prepaid cards have been lapped up instantly by the public.

22,DUTA may go on week-long protest,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi University Teachers Association has proposed a one-week strike from September 10 to 16. The decision was taken by the DUTA extended executive, and will be put before the general body meeting on Wednesday.

DUTA president Shaswati Mazumdar said the strike was the next step in the ongoing agitation against the UGC/ government moves to increase workload and slash the number of teachers, and the continual refusal of the government to honour agreements made with the teachers.

The DUTA executive has also voiced concern over the UGC plans to delink DU colleges from the university by transferring disbursement of funds to the state government, delinking day-to-day governance and empowering the UGC to constitute governing bodies.

The strike will be accompanied by different mass actions such as dharnas at each college in the main and south campus (September 10), march from Ferozshah Kotla grounds to UGC (September 11), DUTA executive meeting at 3 pm to be followed by a torchlight procession to the V-Câ€™s office (September 14), and the DUTA general body meeting at 11 am followed by a march around the campus.

23,Bathinda teachers protest against govt,"BATHINDA: The precarious financial condition of the Punjab government has severely affected the functioning of a number of government aided and non-aided colleges in the s t a t e .

While teachers in the government aided colleges are protesting against the state government for not implementing pension-cum-gratuity scheme, the staff of nonaided and affiliated colleges are not getting their salaries for months together as the college managements cannot afford it.

The teachers of colleges in Bathinda district organised a protest march and burnt the copies of the pension-cumgratuity scheme issued recently by the state government, near district courts complex here on Tuesday. The teachers, who had gathered under the aegis of the Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers Union, alleged that the state government was not implementing the the pension-cum-gratuity scheme of 1996 which was duly approved by the Punjab assembly and state governor in April, 1999.

The teachers alleged that though the 1996 scheme was formulated under the chief ministership of Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, the present government released an amended scheme which was a complete negation of the scheme approved earlier. â€˜â€˜The state government is reportedly not willing to implement the 1996 scheme as it would burden it financially. In the case of non-aided colleges, resentment is prevailing among the teachers for making a cut of 10 per cent in the grant released to these colleges annually, which has resulted in nonpayment of salaries to teachers in these colleges,â€™â€™ said YR Handa, president of the union.

The government is stressing on more self-reliance which is bound to mess up the whole education system, said a union member. Demanding that the government should cover all private colleges in the state under the grant-in-aid scheme, the union leaders said that the governmentâ€™s proposal to shift plus one and two classes from colleges to schools would cause colossal financial loss to the private colleges. Under the 95 per cent grant-in-aid scheme, the Punjab government and the human resources development ministry used to pool 20 per cent and 80 per cent of the grant respectively to these colleges.

But now the government wants to do away with the 95 per cent of the grant and wants the colleges to mobilise their own resources.

24,Health minister wants harsher drugs laws,"NEW DELHI: City health minister A K Walia has proposed amendments in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act to make manufacture and sale of spurious drug punishable with life imprisonment.

Walia said he had written to the Union health and family welfare minister Shatrughan Sinha about the prevalence of spurious drugs in the country.

He said Bhagirath Place in Delhi was one of the largest wholesale markets of drugs in the country and had the potential of becoming a point for transaction of spurious drugs.

Given the high profit margins, spurious drug trade had become an organised criminal activity, with all available modern facilities.

He said with the use of high-tech communication and transport facilities it was becoming very difficult to track down the culprits.

This, he said, called for a severe punishment that would act as a deterrent for new entrants in the trade.

At the moment, Section 27 of the Act says those who manufacture or sell spurious drugs that cause grievous hurt or death would be punishable with life sentence.

Walia said since it was very difficult to prove in court that a fake drug has caused harm, the section required to be amended.

25,DGP submits report on Dhupguri violence,"KOLKATA: West Bengalâ€™s Director-General of Police Dinesh Vajpai on Tuesday submitted a report to the state government following his visit to Dhupguri where Saturday''s attack by the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation on a CPM office left five persons dead.

The DGP, who was heckled by CPM activists and supporters during his visit on Monday refused to talk to newspersons here about the report.

Meanwhile, tourism minister Dinesh Dakua, a senior CPM leader from North Bengal, defended the manifestation of public anger during the DGPâ€™s visit. Wondering why those manning the police outpost within 250 metres of the CPM office Dhupguri did not respond immediately after the KLO attack, Dakua said it was natural for those who lost their near ones to be aggrieved.

Dakua, elected to the Assembly from Mathabhanga, said that he himself had encountered public wrath when he went to the house slain party leader Subhas Sarkar. Pointing out that the incident had occurred at a place from where it took a 30-minute motorcycle ride to the Indo- Bangla or Indo-Bhutan border, Dakua said if the attack had taken place during the day, it could have led to more loss of life.

Meanwhile, in Malda, senior Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has alleged that North Bengal was becoming a hub of terrorist activities and urged chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take steps to ensure proper security in the region.

Condemning the KLOâ€™s recent attack in Dhupguri Das Munshi on Monday told reporters that he had spoken to Union home minister L.K. Advani and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee two years back on this matter and warned them that Pakistanâ€™s ISI, militants from the North-East and Nepalâ€™s Maoist rebels were using Siliguri and adjoining areas as a safe passage.

Das Munshi said that apart from causing terror, KLO activists were committing dacoities on national highways passing through North Bengal.

Expressing concern over reported ISI activities in neighbouring Bangladesh, he lamented that fencing of the border was proceeding slowly.

27,Militants instructed to disrupt J&K polls: Fernandes,"NEW DELHI: Even as defence minister George Fernandes held that the government had â€˜â€˜innumerableâ€™â€™ radio intercepts to show that militants had been instructed from across the border to disrupt the coming Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections, the Army claimed to have foiled three major infiltration bids in the last 24 hours.

â€˜â€˜Eight terrorists were killed in the infiltration bids. Two of these encounters took place in the Machal sector and the third in the Tangdhar sector. A large quantity of arms, ammunition, bombs, rockets and explosives were recovered from them,â€™â€™ said an Army officer.

These infiltration bids come close on the heels of another major one in the Kupwara sector on Saturday night, in which seven militants were killed by the Army. â€˜â€˜This shows that ISI-backed militant outfits in Pakistan are desperate to infiltrate a large number of terrorists into J&K to step up violence in the run-up to the polls,â€™â€™ said the officer.

There was a 20 to 30 per cent drop in infiltration across the Line of Control (LoC) over the last few months. But with the electoral process now being set in motion in J&K, Pakistan has once again stepped up efforts to push in mercenaries.

â€˜â€˜With an estimated 3,000 militants already inside Indian territory, pushing in more would hardly make any difference,â€™â€™ Fernandes said in a television interview.

He said though some violence was inevitable, the Army would take adequate steps and act decisively to foil any attempt to derail the elections. â€˜â€˜Elections will be free and fair. The government is determined to ensure that these polls are violence-free,â€™â€™ said Fernandes.

On President Musharrafâ€™s public assurances to end cross-border terrorism and infiltration, Fernandes said it was very difficult to come to any definitive conclusion about whether Islamabad would stick to its words and accept advice from the international community to keep off the election process in J&K.

28,Geete to replace Prabhu as power minister,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray is in no mood to pay heed to the BJP central leadershipâ€™s suggestion that Union minister for power Suresh Prabhu be allowed to remain in the Atal Behari Vajpayee government, said Sena sources.

An official announcement of the acceptance of Mr Prabhuâ€™s resignation will be made by the PMO on Wednesday, it is learnt. â€œThis time around, Balasaheb will not listen to the BJP. He wants Mr Prabhu to quit and thatâ€™s that,â€™â€™ a senior Sena leader told TNN on Tuesday.

Last week, Mr Prabhu had put in his papers following the Sena chief â€™s instructions.

The real reason appears to be that Mr Prabhu failed to collect funds for the party. Mr Thackeray had recently stated, with characteristic sarcasm, that Mr Prabhu was, like the late Rajiv Gandhi, trying to be Mr Clean.

Union minister of state for finance Anant Geete will be Mr Prabhuâ€™s successor. However, Mr Geete said he was not aware of any move to make him the new power minister.

But he added that he would accept any responsibility bestowed on him by Mr Thackeray. â€œIf Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray thinks he should give me anything more important, I will take it as an honour.â€™â€™

Mr Geete said that he was not aware of Mr Prabhuâ€™s resignation as power minister. Asked whether it was true that there had been a misunderstanding between Mr Prabhu and Mr Thackeray, he said every Shiv Sena member obeyed what Mr Thackeray said.

Mr Thackeray will choose between Sena MPs Anand Adsul and Eknath Thakur as the new incumbent to the office of minister of state for finance, it is learnt. The name of party MP Subodh Mohite is also doing the rounds as Mr Geeteâ€™s successor. The other aspirant is Sanjay Nirupam, but a section of the Sena is vehemently opposed to him.

Over the last several months, the Senaâ€™s inner circle has been agog with speculation that the party chief wanted Mr Prabhu to quit the Union cabinet.
