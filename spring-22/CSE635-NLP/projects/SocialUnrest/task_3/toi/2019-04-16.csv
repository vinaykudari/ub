2,Modi for polls despite water crisis,"ahmedabad: though a severe water and power crisis is looming large over gujarat, chief minister narendra modi appears all set to go ahead with the elections. sources close to modi, however, admit that the hindutva wave may not be enough to ensure a smooth sailing. the severe power and water crisis, that has gripped the state, may cast a shadow over his poll prospects. an almost 2,500 mw shortfall in power in the state has led to extensive power cuts in both urban and rural areas and affected both the agriculture and industry sectors. the deteriorating situation has already raised the hackles of many with reports coming in of people attacking gujarat electricity board sub-stations in saurashtra and a delegation of the bharatiya kisan sangh (bks) meeting energy minister kaushik patel to explain their hardships. bks general secretary maganbhai patel has warned that if the state government did not take effective measures to improve the power supply position, it might launch an agitation. the water supply scene, too, is grim with no respite even for the the chief ministerâ€™s constituency. the state government admitted that there is no way rajkot can get more water this summer via the narmada canal, despite all the talk about â€˜â€˜plans having been drawn outâ€™â€™. there are also reports about a potable water crisis looming large over more than 2,000 villages of saurashtra, north gujarat and panchmahals. ahmedabad and vadodara, too, are inching towards a crisis. the worst-affected districts include rajkot, bhavnagar, amreli and jamnagar in the saurashtra region. banaskantha, patan and mehsana in north gujarat and panchmahals, too, will bear the brunt of drinking water shortage. water supply minister narottam patel, who is believed to have been told by modi to ensure that rajkot should get enough water this summer from the narmada, said: â€˜â€˜while the actual requirement of rajkot is 120 million litres per day (mgd), it cannot take more than 85 mgd because of lack of storage infrastructure.â€™â€™ supplying water to rajkot is an emotional issue for saurashtra, something the cm cannot sidestep, in view of his plans for a snap poll. on monday, modi was locked in a long gujarat infrastructure development board meeting to â€˜â€˜expediteâ€™â€™ pending roads, ports, power, it and energy sector works. in ahmedabad, a delay in maintenance work due to prolonged riots has hampered the prospects of proper water supply with the municipal corporation fearing that water supply may have to be reduced to once a day in peak summer. in vadodara, bjp city unit president shabdasharan brahmbhatt admitted that the water problem will â€˜â€˜annoyâ€™â€™ people.

6,HC raps govt in BSEB case,"patna: a division bench of the patna high court comprising chief justice ravi s dhavan and justice shashank k singh on monday, while resuming hearing in a pil, censured the state government for not filing its reply in a case relating to irregularities in purchases made to the tune of rs 200 crore by the bihar state electricity board (bseb). the purchases were made between 1990 and 1994. the case, filed in 1994 and seeking a cbi inquiry into the purchase, was admitted by the high court then and has come up for hearing now. the petitionerâ€™s lawyer azfar hasan said a large amount of public money had been embezzled through a conspiracy and only a cbi inquiry could bring the guilty to book. he said those involved had got away in spite of glaring evidence regarding their complicity. he said that the bihar legislative council, on the question of a member, had constituted a house committee to probe the purchase of equipment made by the then bseb chairman brahmanand mandal in gross violation of rules, which warranted that the equipment be scrutinised by the central purchase committee. the council had constituted a seven member committee to inquire into the scandal. the committee had found prima facie evidence of gross irregularities in the purchase and had suggested a detailed investigation as it could not physically verify the assets in view of the mandate of the house to report within a week. the then energy minister tulsi das mehta had also accepted the irregularities in the house, he added. azfar said that the government had sacked the chairman, but it was not enough as a huge amount of public money is involved. the chairman had by-passed the central purchase committee and awarded contracts in gross violation of all norms. scams of much lesser magnitude have been handed over by the high court to the cbi, and, therefore, it was a fit case for it, he said. the bsebâ€™s counsel mihir jha, while admitting the truth of the reports, said that the chairman had already been sacked and the ball now was in the court of the government. the additional secretary of the board affirmed the affidavit earlier filed by an assistant. kumhrar site: the state government informed a division bench comprising justice dhavan and justice singh that it sanctioned rs 50 lakh for the upkeep of the kumhrar archaeological site. it released rs 10 lakh in the last fiscal itself. state government counsel alamdar hussain said that though it has taken many steps, the responsibility of preserving the site is with the the asi. blaming the centre for its mismanagement, hussain said the asi has a meagre budget of rs 80 lakh for important sites in up, uttaranchal, bihar, jharkhand and orissa and can hardly do anything meaningful. excise laws: the government informed the division bench that it has constituted a committee to examine excise laws in the state and overhaul them. the bench also noted the absence of peopleâ€™s participation in the formation of excise laws, which it termed archaic. this led to bars and toddy shops mushrooming near schools, temples and market complexes.

""we want a focussed discussion under rule 184 which would permit a substantive motion. the government is unwilling for a discussion under rule 184 because it is not sure how its own allies will behave,"" said congress spokesman jaipal reddy. echoing this, senior cpm leader somnath chatterjee said: ""the government is obviously unsure of its allies...it is a pathetic situation"". the congress parliamentary party met in the morning and decided not to compromise on rule 184 and also that the party would work at consolidating opposition unity in parliament. chatterjee too convened a meeting which was attended by former prime minister deve gowda and nationalist congress party leader sharad pawar, apart from other left, samajwadi party and muslim league leaders. the veteran marxist leader said pawar had strongly suggested that the gujarat issue be discussed under rule 184. the ncp''s present political inclination has come under question since it voted with the government on the prevention of terrorism ordinance, with speculation that the bjp is actively wooing the party. chatterjee said the hectic activity and coming together of the opposition parties was a bid to ""mobilise secular forces in the country"", more than a political move to form government along with the congress. jaipal reddy too said: ""we are not into the destabilisation game and neither are we making an effort to provide an alternative government. we are only interested in watching the developments."" on monday, congress leader sonia gandhi invited senior leaders of other parties for an impromptu meeting on the gujarat issue, setting the tone for renewed opposition bonhomie. the meeting, which focussed on floor coordination and the opposition strategy on the gujarat issue in the next few days and it was decided that the parties would not relent on the issue of discussing gujarat through a censure motion. it was significant as it brought together sonia gandhi and mulayam singh yadav, who have shared cold vibes since the uttar pradesh elections. the two leaders are said to have had a cordial discussion.
