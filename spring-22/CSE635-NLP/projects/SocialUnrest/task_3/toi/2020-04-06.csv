0,Nurses asks CSMMU to frame service rules,"LUCKNOW: Mary.J.Malik, secretary, Trained Nursesâ€™ Association of India has said that unless the CSM Medical University (CSMMU) frames service rules for the nurses cadre and it is given an opportunity to study those rules, the nurses cadre would not be in a position to opt whether to stay in the service of CSMMU or serve in government hospitals.

She said ever since the KGMC had been upgraded to CSMMU, the nurses cadre were quite apprehensive about their service conditions.

She said in the past also KGMC was under Lucknow University but the services of the nurses cadre were governed by the state government.

1,Power reforms could get politically short-circuited,"GANDHINAGAR: Can the announcement on withdrawal of Rs 55 crore per month subsidy to the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) â€” given by the state for two years to shield farmers against the massive 350% increase in unmetered power tariff â€” be considered the first signal towards reviving the reforms agenda?

Part of the proposed policy to reform the state finances, the subsidy withdrawal should save Rs 600 crore per annum for the state exchequer.

Yet, there is still nothing to suggest that the entire subsidy will go. ""The state finance department is keen, but the political leadership doesnâ€™t want to displease the farmers,"" said a top bureaucrat. A formula may be worked out to ""protect"" the farmers.

Studies suggest, even as the state loses a huge amount due to the subsidy, the actual gain to the farmer has been meagre. With subsidy intact, they paid between Rs 350 to Rs 500 for each horse power (HP) per annum for erratic 8 hours per day unmetered supply. Without subsidy, they would end up paying Rs 1,764 per HP per annum. A Tata Energy Research Institute study said if farmers shift to meters, they would pay Rs 650 per HP. Indeed, they would not be paying for the 16 hours when power is not available.

Yet, the sentiment against metering farm connections is so great that so far there is little to suggest that the state may move to metered power supply.

An official note attached with the energy reforms Bill, passed in the state Assembly on March 26, postpones the installation of meters till June 30, 2006. A top bureaucrat conceded, ""The officialdom doesnâ€™t think that meters are a must for the reforms.""

Even if the Rs 55-crore subsidy is withdrawn, no one knows what the stateâ€™s plans are to further reduce the huge Rs 2,200 crore per annum subsidy given to the GEB. Its accumulated losses have reached a huge Rs 4,951 crore. GEBâ€™s consumers are up from 1 lakh in 1960 to 73 lakh today, yet consumer services have not kept pace.

An official document released on Friday agreed that the ""GEB is unable to ensure 24-hour quality supply of power to all sectors of consumers, especially the rural feeders which are currently restricted to 8 to 9 hours."" It adds, ""The GEB has imposed power cuts on industry from time to time, which impairs productivity and overall performance due to inadequate investment in power generation.""

Unable to focus on the specific task of improvement in its technical and financial parameters and most of the time indulging fire-fighting and managing the day-to-day crises, the GEB has failed to ""raise resources to fund its long-term capital as well as working capital requirements.""

Insists the document, ""The financial institutions, the RBI and other lenders have stipulated stringent norms for the disbursement of finance. As such, the GEB is having poor rating from the financial institutions.""

Sharply critical of the failure of the GEB to run on ""commercial principles in view of various political and social considerations of the state government"", the document seeks to give the impression that the electricity reforms Bill will trigger corporatisation of the ""unwieldy"" body by splitting it into separate generation, transmission and distribution entities.

How the splitting of GEB would help, when ""political and social considerations"" have already put on hold the movement towards privatising the power board, is not clear. Finalised under pressure from GEB unions, the electricity reforms Bill says no privatisation can take place without approval from the Assembly.

2,Controversy haunts AUTA elections,"ALLAHABAD: The dates for holding of elections to Allahabad University Teachers Association (AUTA) is drawing near, even as controversy over the validity of elections is being debated amongst the teaching fraternity. The elections are scheduled to be held on April 10 in the Economics department.

Even as several teachers who had joined the rebel faction returned to the parent body after â€˜realisingâ€™ the genuinity of the AUTA office bearers, others do not see eye to eye. Appeals and assurances of AUTA president Yogeshwar Tiwari has fallen on deaf ears, as has the notice sent by an advocate on behalf of AUTA. Sources tell us that the AUTA officers bearers are contemplating to move court against the elections being held on Thursday while the other faction is gearing up with documents and pleas to put forth their stand as a counter.

Clearly then, things have come back to square one. Whither teachersâ€™ unity and whither efforts to have a common platform for teachers ? Was the present association working against their interests or is the second faction trying to act as a puppet in the hands of varsity administration ? Why only blame the students then who are woefully divided along caste, religion, political lines ?

3,Keshubhai's outburst ups political temperature,"GANDHINAGAR: The political temperature in the state capital was ratcheted up a few points with the outburst of former chief minister Keshubhai Patel against his successor Narendra Modi at the condolence meeting held in the memory of former minister Haren Pandya in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Patelâ€™s remarks are being seen by the swelling number of dissidents within the ruling BJP as a clear signal that the ex-CM has finally decided to flex his muscles after lying dormant for long.

Patelâ€™s decision to leave for New Delhi on Monday has only added to speculations about his game-plan and BJP MLAs seemed divided into two distinct camps. A large number of party MLAs, ministers and top leaders agreed with Patel that Modiâ€™s conduct in sending a dedicated party worker like Pandya into political oblivion and not bestowing upon him honours even after his death, were issues the BJP would have to look at.

Fishing in troubled waters, especially after Pandyaâ€™s father made the remark that the killing was â€œpolitically motivatedâ€� and that this was â€˜Ravan rajâ€™ in Gujarat, was the leader of Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly, Amarsinh Choudhary. On Monday, he demanded the resignation of Modi â€œto make way for an independent investigation into the Pandya murder caseâ€�.

Chaudhary told reporters on Monday that Modiâ€™s name should be included in the FIR and he should be remanded and interrogated, since his name was cropping up time and again in the case. He also criticised Deputy Prime Minister Advaniâ€™s remarks on the involvement of mafia dons on the ground that â€œthese tend to influence the investigations being carried out by the CBIâ€�.

However, all eyes are on BJP MLAs who were on Monday seen holding quiet meetings in ante-rooms of ministersâ€™ offices, expressing outrage at the manner in which they were stopped from going to Pandyaâ€™s â€˜besnaâ€™ on March 28. They said Modi held an urgent BJP legislature party meeting that day â€˜ensuringâ€™ that no MLA could attend â€˜besnaâ€™ Modi, too, is not sitting quiet. Informed sources said several ministers, including Amit Shah, Ashok Bhatt, Kaushik Patel and Anandiben Patel, have been entrusted the task of quelling the groundswell of emotion on the Pandya issue. â€œThey would not just try to convince Harenâ€™s father and other family members not to make such harmful statements, but also party cadres,â€� the source insisted. Modiâ€™s aides have suggested that this was the right time to go in for expansion of his 16-member ministry.

Soon after the condolence meeting on Sunday, Patel had a one-to-one meeting with Advani at the Circuit House annexe. Though Patel has refused to discuss the contents of the discussions, close aides described him as being in â€œa belligerent moodâ€�.

At least two senior ministers conceded that Modi would have to go in for a cabinet expansion shortly as the MLAs are getting increasingly restive over the Pandya issue and also the style of functioning of the chief minister which is completely self-centred.

4,5 holidays in a row for state govt officials,"AHMEDABAD: A surfeit of holidays await state government servants over the week-end. Many officials are planning to take advantage of this flurry of holidays by making bookings at nearby tourist destinations like Mount Abu, Udaipur, Diu and Daman.

The only dampener, perhaps, is the fact that vacations have not started in most schools and universities yet, and this would keep many families grounded.

April 11 is Ram Navmi, April 12 a second Saturday, April 13 a Sunday, April 14 Ambedkar Jayanti and April 15 Mahavir Jayanti. Thatâ€™s a straight five-day closure. But there is more coming if one is willing to take two dayâ€™s casual leave on April 16 and 17, because April 18 is Good Friday. Schools and colleges in the state would also be able to avail holidays on these dates.

While the state government employees are having it good, there is growing disenchantment among banking sector employees on not being granted the same number of holidays as their counterparts in the state government.

According to Gujarat state government office order dated November 25, 2002, 12 public holidays were declared for the year 2003 under the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881. However, state government employees have been granted more than double the declared holidays in the current year.

â€œThe bank employees, however, will continue to be governed by Negotiable Instrument Act, which stipulates only 12 holidays for them. This is grossly unfair and discriminatory,â€� said secretary of Nabard Officerâ€™s Association, Ahmedabad, N S Yaadava. â€œHowever, there is no such bonanza for us,â€� said Yaadava.

The central government employees, meanwhile, will get holidays on April 14, 15 and 18. â€œEarlier, we did not have a holiday on April 14, but now we have made a representation to the authorities in Delhi, after which we will also have a holiday on that date,â€� said an official at Indian Space Research Organisation, Ahmedabad.

State PSUs such as GSFC and GNFC, however, will get the same number of holidays as the banking sector.

While state government employees are rejoicing, travel agents too are rubbing their hands in glee. â€œWe have already started receiving enquiries from families wanting to spend the long weekend away from the heat and dust of Ahmedabad, and anticipate many more to come,â€� said Maitreyee Vakharia of Pathfinders tours and travels.

5,First pro-US rally in city on April 8,"AHMEDABAD: While the world over governments and people have demonstrated their reservation about US decision to wage a war on Iraq, a group in the city has decided to support the war, â€œin the larger interestsâ€� of the country.

A few professionals in the city and outside have come together to express their solidarity with the coalition forces led by the US and UK under the banner of Alliance Against Terrorism (AAT). The members of AAT have organised a rally on Tuesday to demonstrate their support to US-led war on Iraq. It is the only such initiative taken by any organisation in India.

The convenor of the national executive committee of AAT Dr Nagesh Bhandari said on Monday: â€œWe felt time had come for the silent majority to speak up and voice its dissent against the support to fundamentalist elements such as Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. By condemning USâ€™s use of force against them, one is indirectly supporting them.â€�

In a show of strength, the AAT would hold a rally near the Vivekananda Statue on Tuesday. â€œI believe India should support this war as our ultimate aim is to fight the â€˜jehadiâ€™ forces that mushroom in our neighbouring country. It seems from USâ€™s tough posture on Islamic fundamentalism, that Pakistan is next in line after Iraq,â€� said Dr Jayesh Patel of AAT. When asked if this group would restrict itself to protesting Islamic terrorism or would condemn an episode such as the post-Godhra riots, Patel said: â€œWe will condemn anything that goes against the tenets of humanity.â€�

AAT, that has financial and ideological support from NRI professionals, would register itself formally as a voluntary organisation next month.
