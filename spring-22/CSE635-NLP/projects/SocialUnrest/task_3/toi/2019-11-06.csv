1,Mishra hits out at govt for Dalit killings,"PATNA: NCP leader Jagannath Mishra has condemned the increase in number of Dalit killings in the state. He said that the state police administration had failed in checking Dalit killings.

Speaking to media persons, the NCP leader condemned the recent killings of five Dalits in the Burh Manjui village under the Fatehpur police station of the Gaya district. Mishra said that the situation has come to such a pass that Naxalites and criminal gangs freely indulge in massacres for their own selfish interests.

The NCP leader said that economic stagnation is also a crucial factor in leading to such an anarchic situation in the state. He said that during the 12-year-long Laloo-Rabri regime, more than 70,000 people have been killed in the state out of which 10,000 were Dalits.

2,New rules for minority colleges soon in Andhra Pradesh,"HYDERABAD: The state government will soon frame rules for admissions to minority education institutions MEI), keeping in view the recent Supreme Court judgment on the subject. The Andhra Pradesh State Council for Higher Education (APSCHE), the apex body monitoring higher education in the state, has commissioned a group of legal experts to study various aspects of the apex court order on MEIs.

â€œBased on the legal opinion, an expert committee would to draft the rules governing admissions. The opinion of the advocate-general and the legal department would be sought, before the government comes up with a GO,â€� APSCHE chairman Prof C Subba Rao told The Times of India here on Tuesday. The apex court, in its judgment last week, ruled that MEIs that do not draw government aid are free to admit students based on a transparent system and merit order.

The court, however, said aided colleges must adhere to the process prescribed by the government. Since the MEIs must obtain government clearance for recognition and affiliation to universities, sources in the education department said the apex court order did not completely eliminate government control over the unaided minority institutions.

â€œThe order too did not specify how the respective institutions should gauge merit of candidates. It is not possible for individual colleges to hold entrance tests for each category to admit students,â€� a source said. The latest Supreme Court order on MEIs will annul all previous government orders issued for governing minority colleges in the state. â€œAdmissions to all minority educational institutions in future would be based on the new apex court judgment and the rules framed for the purpose,â€� Subba Rao said.

3,"Kelkar’s pill to revive markets, up investment","NEW DELHI: A total implementation of the Vijay Kelkar Committee report on direct taxes would rejuvenate the stock markets and help improve the business environment in the country, feel experts. However, the positive impact would be on account of doing away with the dividend tax, introduction of zero tax on long term capital gains and simplification of tax rules and not because of suggested reduction in direct corporate tax.

Agrees chairman of Ernst and Young KN Memani: The proposed simplification in the tax rules and doing away with the dividend tax to benefit shareholders would provide a relief to corporate India. A senior broker said the proposal of removing tax burden on long term capital gains along with making dividend income tax free would revive the stock markets.

At present, the long term capital gains tax is 10 per cent. Removal of this would give enough incentive to high networth individuals to invest in the risk capital which has become a scarce commodity. This would give a big boost to the industrial activities, he added. Kelkar in his report, suggested to bring down the corporate tax rate from 36.75 per cent to 30 per cent and also recommended to remove exemptions in the corporate taxes. This may not provide huge reduction in the tax burden on corporate. On the whole, the report said, the revenue collection through corporate tax wonâ€™t be affected. This means, there would not be much relief to corporate. This might lead to an increase in the tax burden for companies taking benefits of various deductions and exemptions.

Kelkar has suggested a uniform balance-sheet and to do away with the present system of two different balance-sheets. One under The Companies Act where they donâ€™t show high depreciation to increase profit for offering high dividend to shareholders. And the other under tax rule where they show high depreciation to reduce profit to lower tax liabilities. Memani said removal of all deductions and exemptions might not offer any significant gain to corporate. He, however, differed with a view that investments would be affected adversely, if favourable tax treatment on investment was withdrawn. He said that last seven yearsâ€™ practice of giving favourable tax treatments to investments had hardly yielded a positive result. Investment would follow good business opportunities and not favourable tax treatments.

Making shareholdersâ€™ dividend income tax free would increase the fund flow in the equity. Memani said this would help the corporate in raising funds. The committeeâ€™s suggestion to allow the business loss to be carried forward indefinitely would also help the corporate in making investments. The committee also suggested the removal of the distinction between unabsorbed depreciation and loss.

11,Samata raises disinvestment issue again,"NEW DELHI: The Samata Party, BJP''s closest ally, appears to be making tenative moves to dissociate itself from the NDA government''s functioning.

It has, once again, raised questions on the issue of disinvestment, called for a mid-term evaluation of the implementation of the NDA agenda and also distanced itself from the BJP in Gujarat by announcing its decision to contest 50 seats in the coming assembly polls on its own.

With the BJP''s popularity dipping gradually, it has become imperative for the its allies to re-establish their own distinct identity as opposed to the main ruling party and this appears to be an effort in that direction..

Releasing the resolutions adopted at its recent national executive meeting held at Rajkot, Samata Party spokesperson Shambhu Shrivastava on Wednesday attacked the government on the ""procedure and speed"" of disinvestment, particularly the sale of Mumbai-based Centaur Hotel and IPCL. It also demanded that the government undertake a mid-term evaluation of its agenda, particularly its economic policies.

Shrivastava rushed to clarify that his party has no differences on the disinvestment policy or privatisation per se but but felt the procedures hav created misgivings among the people, which need to be cleared. This is not the first time the Samata Party has raised the disinvestment issue. Nearly two months ago, its president and defence minister George Fernandes had raised serious objections to the sale of oil PSUs and effectively blocked their sale on grounds of national security.

Shrivastava, cited the of Mumbai-based Centaur hotel which, he said was sold in February for Rss 83 crore to Batra Hospitality which resold it within six months to the Sahara group for Rs.115 crore, earning a profit of Rs. 32 crore at a ""time of market recession"". Regarding the ""strategic sale'' of IPCL to the Reliance group, he alleged the government''s ""own guidelines were not adhered to by allowing the company to bid for IPCL even as its top officials have been charged with violation of Official Secrets Act.""

The Samata Party wanted the PM to convene a meeting of senior ministers to discuss the disinvestment issue and re-evaluate the procedure on the basis of arguments forwarded by various quarters. At the same time, it also warned the government against allowing replacement of public sector monopoly by private sector monopoly and demanded that any information on evaluation, bidders, reason for evaluation of a property and share-holders agreement be made public much before a deal is struck.

Shrivastava also announced that the Samata Party, would contest the Gujarat polls alone and field candidates in 50 of the 182 seats, adding that it will have no alliance with the BJP. He said there will be no common manifesto or programme, stating there was a proposal for seat-adjustment with BJP and Fernandes had conveyed it to BJP president Venkaiah Naidu who asked for a week''s time to decide. However, there has been no word from them so far, he added.

12,Task force to look into development,"MUMBAI: The state government has issued a government resolution (GR) to set up a task force to look into the planning and redevelopment of the eastern waterfront.

The GR comes in the wake of the Mumbai Port Trustâ€™s (MBT) decision to sell off its surplus leased out lands. The order, dated October 22, states, â€œAny isolated and uncoordinated efforts in disposing of the surplus land of the port may not realise its full potential value. It is, therefore, necessary that the agencies concerned like the MBT, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA),work together to arrive at a common planâ€�.
