1,Expert calls for changes in laws,"PUNE: Raising serious issues related to the countryâ€™s judicial system, citybased legal expert Satyaranjan Sathe has called for abolition of some existing laws and amendments to others.

There are several obsolete laws in the country, which delay justice, Sathe argued, while addressing a meeting on, â€˜The constitution review committeeâ€™s reportâ€™, on Tuesday. The meeting was part of the ongoing Lokshahi Utsav Samiti events (on till February 3) at the Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal here.

Citing the example of the contemptof-court law, Sathe said, â€œIt is the most antiquated and misused law in the country,whereby, even if a judge is corrupt, citizens cannot say anything against him. Itâ€™s high time we abolish such laws in public interest.â€�

Section 19 of the constitution bestows freedom of speech on citizens. â€œHowever, when political activists smear soot on a personâ€™s face, just because they do not agree with his/her opinions, they make sheer mockery of Section 19,â€� Sathe pointed out.

2,Abattoirs flouting laws,"NEW DELHI: The bird flu scare has bird lovers running like headless chicken, but it is not as if meat eaters can settle down to a sumptuous bite.

The city abounds with illegal abattoirs or slaughter houses.

Officially, there are over 500 goats and sheep slaughtered daily at the only legal abattoir, but experts believe that the actual supply and consumption is up to five times higher.

The MCD''s abattoir, the Idgah Slaughter House in Quresh Nagar is hardly a model to follow.

""The surroundings stink and there is no provision for drainage or sewage.,"" an MCD official said. The project was tendered in August last year when one east Delhi-based company evinced interest in the project.

""We have tendered the proposal twice after that. The cost has risen from Rs 40 crore to above Rs 70 crore, but there seems to be no headway in the process,"" an MCD official said.

Municipal commissioner Rakesh Mehta, however, denied the delay. ""It is a very complex, project. We need to import equipment from Germany and New Zealand. Tendering it thrice wasa precautionary move,"" he said.

3,"Bird flu: No cause for panic, says govt","NEW DELHI: Even as bird flu is creating a flap, Delhi government is busy saying there is nothing to panic about. Nearly 4 lakh chicken, were slaughtered in the city on Wednesday.

However, the government health department has come out with a contingency plan to combat against any possible outbreak of the flu.

Doctors and inspectors are being posted at all poultry markets in the five zones of the city.

The department is even considering banning the entry of poultry coming from neighbouring states. But that will create another crisis as over 80 per cent of the poultry consumed by Delhiites comes from outside.

Health minister Yoganand Shastri said: ""We have already issued directions to poultry farm owners to be extra vigilant and take precautions.""

He said the department is yet to receive any specific guidelines from WHO.

""Poultry owners have been told to segregate the chicken in the poultry farms if they come across any mortality or other signs of death due to the flu,"" the minister said.

5,Governor summons principal Secy (home),"LUCKNOW: Governor Vishnukant Shastri on Wednesday summoned principal secretary, home, Anil Kumar to know about the steps taken by the government to nab the killers of grandnephew of Prime Minister Vajpayee. The prime ministerâ€™s grandnephew Manish Mishra was thrown out of a running train on Saturday last.

Sources in the Raj Bhawan said that the governor inquired about the timing of acceptance of FIR in the case and subsequent steps taken to expedite the investigation into Manishâ€™s death. In an unusual step, Shastri told the official to keep him posted about the developments in the case. The governor also asked the official to accelerate the pace of investigation, said the official.

Acknowledging the summon from Raj Bhawan, Anil Kumar said that he had posted the governor about the steps taken by the government . A similar step was taken by the then governor of UP Motilal Vora in 1995 when he had expressed his unhappiness over the law and order situation in the state and asked him to improve things at the earliest.

Principal secretary to the governor, Shambhu Nath, said that this was an unusal step when there was a popular government in the state .In the past on one occasion the governor had summouned officials to inquire about Ayodhya developments and on the other to acquint himself with the governmentâ€™s preparation for the Haj pilgirms.

Meanwhile, the investigating officials have deputed six teams and dispatched them in different directions. The DIG Railway is coordinating between the teams working on the basis of clues received after flashing of sketches of the suspects on television, said secretary, home, Hemant Rao. The teams sent in various directions comprise senior officials of police, GRP and members of special protection groups.

Rao said though the ADG Railways V K Bhalla has returned from Mathura, he was yet to submit his report. The government will take any action only after getting his report, said the official.

Rao said that soon after flashing of sketches on television, a number of phone calls were received by the police and other investigating team members. The team was in possession of some definite clues on the basis of which the culprits would be arrested soon, he said. When confronted about the complaint made by Manishâ€™s father that the FIR could be filed only after someone spoke to the PMO about the calamity, the official said he was unaware about the delay in this matter. Manishâ€™s father had made the statement while talking to a news channel.

The principal secretary, home, said that the chief minister gave Rs two lakh to the bereaved family and Rs one lakh to the boy who was injured in the incident. Manishâ€™s family, however, had said that they did not need any financial assistance from the government but only wanted proper investigation so that the culprits could be arrested soon.

6,Truckers seek breathing space on pollution rule,"MUMBAI: In three daysâ€™ time, the deadline expires for transporters with eight-year-old heavy commercial vehicles to acquire Euro II-compliant ones, convert the engines of existing vehicles to ones that use cleaner fuelsâ€”like Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)â€” or get off the roads altogether.

TNN outlines the issue: The marching orders: The Bombay high court issued the phase-out order as part of an ongoing case against vehicular pollution that seeks to clean up the cityâ€™s air. Fifteen-year-old heavy vehicles have already been off the roads since mid-2003, as are cabbies and autos over 15.

The problem: Transporters say replacing so many vehicles with ones that comply to Euro II pollution norms is too expensive â€”a new vehicle costs Rs 8 lakhs to Rs 12 lakhs. The court has turned down the cheaper option of retrofitting Euro II engines on existing vehicles because of technical problems.

Meanwhile, since there are no CNG kits available in the market and no CNG available in other states, converting engines to ones that use CNG is also impossible.

The impact: Transporters claim that 60 to 70 per cent of vehicles are over eight years old. Banning them will affect the supply of vegetables, fruits, water, raw materials and finished goods, they claim. It would also lead to a humanitarian crisis since each truck employs three people and supports about 12, they say.

The last-ditch efforts: Some truckers are striking and some have gone to the supreme court to get more time, though earlier such efforts have failed. They have also got the state government to back them in the SC.

7,Shinde flexible on joint elections,"MUMBAI: Faced with being isolated within the Congress, chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Wednesday reneged on his earlier stand that elections to the state assembly should not be held along with the Lok Sabha polls.

He told newspersons here after the weekly cabinet meeting that he was â€œflexibleâ€™â€™ to the idea of simultaneous polls.

Mr Shinde denied having a personal agenda when he opposed simultaneous elections earlier. But sources in Mantralaya said he was keen on holding the assembly polls as scheduled in September 2004 so that he could continue in office a few months more. He recently completed one year in office.

Mr Shinde was forced to revise his stand since a majority of Congress MLAs favour simultaneous polls.

He met Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi recently to press his viewpoint, but she advised him to consult other constituents of the Democratic Front before taking a final decision.

All India Congress Committee general secretary in charge of Maharashtra Vayalar Ravi will join him in this exercise.

Former chief minister and Congress Working Committee member Vilasrao Deshmukh spearheaded the campaign for simultaneous elections. He was forced to step down from chief ministership last year by Ms Gandhi and is reportedly keen on regaining the post.

Many in the Congress suspect that Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar will join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance after the Lok Sabha polls, in which case he will not tie up with the Congress for the assembly polls.

Congress activists feel that the best way to counter Mr Pawarâ€™s game plan is to hold simultaneous polls. They also feel that this is the best time to pressure Mr Pawar, because he is faced with a split in his party.

Mr Pawar is fighting with his back to the wall to retain the clock symbol for his party. If the Election Commission deprives him of the symbol, he will have a tough time popularising the new symbol.

Meanwhile, the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) passed a resolution urging the party high command to suspend minister of state for home (Rural) Kripashankar Singh from the party.

8,Kin of double-murder victim commits suicide,"AHMEDABAD: A relative of Pritpal Singh â€” the victim of a double- murder case where Pritpal along with his 15-year-old servant Chhotu had been stabbed to death at their residence in Satellite area â€” committed suicide on Monday afternoon.

Rajendra Singh alias Pappu, cousin brother of Pritpal, jumped into the water tank at the industrial unit owned by Pritpal â€” Amrit Steel Rolling Mill in Changodar. His body was later fished out and handed over to the Civil Hospital authorities for post-mortem.

A suicide note recovered from the site said that Singh had been aggrieved and depressed over Pritpalâ€™s murder. The note says that Pritpalâ€™s parents had entrusted his guardianship to Rajendra who, after the murder, felt that he had failed in his duty and decided to end his life. The note also requests the city police to track down Pritpalâ€™s killers and see them to the gallows.

Officials of Satellite police station who are investigating the case have also procured the fingerprints of the suicide victim as a precautionary measure. Meanwhile, sources told TNN that the lines of investigation being followed by the police, have not yielded any results.

The police were following two possibilities behind the murder â€” illicit relations with women or financial disputes.

Three police teams were despatched to different locations of Gujarat to check what could have led to the murder but nothing concrete has emerged so far. Investigating officers are now checking calls that Pritpal had made from his two telephones.

Medico bid to end life: A doctor associated with the AMC-run Shardaben Hospital tried to commit suicide on Sunday night by consuming some poisonous liquid. Dr Vikram Mehta was spotted by neighbours and family members on time and rushed to the hospitalâ€™s emergency ward.

Later the doctor was shifted to the V S Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital.

When Mehta regained consciousness, he allegedly told the Sherkotda police which is investigating the case, that stress at work and pressure of keeping up with academics (he was an apprentice in MS Department) had driven him to suicide.

Murder bid: A complaint of attempt to murder was filed at the Naroda police station on Monday by Manojsinh Bhadoria (28), a resident of Thakkarnagar. Bhadoria has accused Pappu Tribhovan, Gopal Tribhovan, Pinki and an unidentified person of breaking into his house and beating him up with sticks and metal pipes.

Bhadoria, who has been admitted to the Shardaben Hospital, has also alleged that one of the accused, Gopal, had also fired in the air from a revolver. Police officials investigating the case said that Pappu,who used to allegedly sell illicit countrymade liquor, believed that Bhadoria was a police informer and had been responsible for police crackdowns.

9,"Bird flu: Hawk eye on poultry farms, airport","KOLKATA: The bird flu scare has gripped the state. The government has beefed up watch over poultry farms and the airport has been ordered not to let any plane land if it has poultry in its cargo.

Animal husbandry minister Anisur Rahman said that the administration wouldn''t take any chances although it is yet to receive reports on the avian influenza spreading in South Asia.

An alert from the Union agriculture department has only intensified the state''s concerns on bird flu.

The government has set up a monitoring committee comprising chief secretary Asok Gupta, health secretary Asim Burman and animal husbandry secretary Subesh Das.

Union health secretary J.V. S. Prasad Rao is coming to Kolkata to take stock of the precautionary measures.

The animal resources development department has intensified vigil in all staterun and private poultry farms as suggested in the 10-point charter issued by the Union government as a precaution against bird flu.

Rahman on Wednesday met with health minister Surjya Kanta Misra and Satyasaran Ghosh, vice-chancellor of the West Bengal University of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, to finalise the do''s and dont''s for poultry farms and consumers and find ways to prevent the disease.

""As of now there is no harm in taking chicken. I have talked to the Bangladesh deputy high commissioner. We have asked our officials to check with poultry farms whether their chickens had suffered from diseases similar to the H5N1 type of virus in the last month or two. If it is so, the government will impose restrictions on them,"" said Rahman.

Following the Centre''s orders, poultry owners have been asked not to allow vehicles or people from outside to enter the farms. The guideline calls for keeping a tab on the suppliers of chicken feed as well.

Poultry farms have been asked not to procure imported chicken feed but bank on registered domestic suppliers.

The state animal husbandry secretary and director have been asked to ensure that the guidelines are followed. At the NSCBI Airport, the animal quarantine division has imposed a ban against import of poultry or poultry products from ""suspect"" countries.

Airport officials said the Union agriculture ministry had issued a circular that banned all aircraft carrying poultry products from landing at the airport.

""We are particularly keeping a check on planes that arrive from Thailand. Since there are no direct flights to Kolkata from Vietnam, Japan and Korea, the threat is not too great,"" airport quarantine eastern region director N.N. Ray said.

10,"Tax anomalies to be removed, says minister","PATNA: The chairman of the economic sub-committee of the state cabinet and water resources minister, Jagadanand Singh, here on Wednesday assured the members of the Bihar Industries Association (BIA) that the anomalies arising out of imposition of entry tax in the state would be removed soon.

Speaking at an interactive session with BIA members, Singh said that he had had deliberations with the commercial taxes officials in this regard during which he had asked them to remove the anomalies.

At the outset, the BIA president, S K Mehrotra, put forth the BIA demand for ""set off on entry tax"" and ""set off on sales tax on inputs for the industries"". He also urged rationalisation of commercial taxes in the state.

Being the chairman of the economic sub-committee of the cabinet, the minister should announce the economic agenda of the state for development, Mehrotra said.

Singh assured that government departments would issue notifications in this regard as per the provisions made in the Bihar State Industrial Policy, 2003.

The state government has to stand by its commitment with regard to implementation of the industrial policy, he added.

Singh assured the BIA that the state government would support the state trade and industry. In certain areas, the Central government had advised the state government to give some excise relief on entry of some articles, including beer produced in Nepal, he added.

Singh admitted chinks in the armour of the state government when he realised that at some juncture the state had proved itself to be a sort of ""usurer"". He said the government cannot run industry and at the same time consider it as the milching cow.

Singh expressed concern over the fact that the power regulatory commission had not been constituted yet in the state.

In a statement, Jha said that the the Union government did not think it proper to prorogue the Lok Sabha on December 24 when it was adjourned sine die by the Speaker.

The Centre scuttled the Presidential Address before Parliament as required under Article 87 of the Constitution, he said.

Questioning the legal propriety of the Centre''s decision, Jha said that the Centre should not have bypassed Parliament ""in obtaining its approval for financial concessions to the tune of Rs 65,000 crore.""

12,'84 riots claim: SC issues notice to UP govt,"NEW DELHI: Moved by the plea of an anti-Sikh riot victim alleging denial of compensation due to him, the Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice to Uttar Pradesh government.

14,Duty-free office equipment for service firms,"MUMBAI: Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley has put domestic services firms on a more profitable footing by allowing them imports of office and professional equipment under the duty-free entitlement scheme.

While BPO and software companies with foreign clients already enjoy a duty-free status on imported equipment, BPO firms that have local clients will benefit from the latest move.

An indirect tax expert at a consulting firm explained that under the new policy, the categorisation of office and professional equipment had been changed from ''capital goods'' to ''office goods'', thereby reducing the import duty on them from 39 per cent to 5 per cent.

However, companies have to export services worth eight times the duty saved on such imports. Any service firm that earns foreign exchange can avail of the benefits under the new policy.

""This is a big break for domestic BPO providers. Companies that have been providing BPO services to foreign clients and want to branch into the domestic sector will now be able to avail of the duty-free entitlement scheme. It ensures a level playing field for firms who offer services to both foreign and domestic clients,"" Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said.

18,Cong MLA objects to Poojari's dikdat on joint elections,"MYSORE: Congress MLA from Mysore district A S Guruswamy who defeated JDS chief Siddaramaiah in the last elections took strong objection to the statement of Janardhan Poojari that party will not re-nominate those MLAs who oppose simultaneous election to Lok Sabha and state Assembly.

â€œPoojariâ€™s remarks will not augur well with the internal democracy of the partyâ€�, he reacted, replying to queries of reporters on the issue of dissolution of state assembly and holding elections to it along with Lok Sabha.

Guruswamy said in Congress every individual has his or her own right and freedom to express his or her opinion on various issues and Poojari cannot question and curtail this right of partymen.

He said simultaneous elections have its own advantages and disadvantages for the party. â€œWhile elections to Lok Sabha are fought on national issues, where as state elections are fought purely on local issues and performance of the prevailing governmentâ€� he said adding that this would prove good for the party or disastrous. One cannot predict how these issues will benefit the respective parties, he added.

Guruswamy said he had a lengthy discussion with Shantmurthy of Institute for Economic and Social change, Bangalore and he has listed out various losses for the state exchequer if the elections are held during this time along with Lok Sabha elections.

â€œAccording to Shantamurthy though simultaneous polls may save some money for election commission, but February and March being the months for collecting taxes in hundreds of crores, simultaneous polls will badly affect the tax collectionâ€� he revealed, adding that elections will also hamper the developmental works as there will be nobody to monitor these works.

Guruswamy said he will speak in detail at the forthcoming CLP meeting on February 4 summoned to discuss this issue.

â€œIt is left to the party high command to decide whether to hold simultaneous elections or notâ€� he said, claiming that he is an articulate speaker in the CLP meetings where other MLAs seldom speak.

â€œIt is my duty to disclose pros and cons of simultaneous elections and nobody will take away this right of mineâ€� he replied to a pointed question, adding that nobody will take away my right to express my opinion freely and frankly.

In reply to a question, Guruswamy said he will contest and win the next Assembly elections and there is no doubt about he defeating Siddaramaiah once again. â€œLast time also everybody said that Siddaramaiah is invincible, but I did it and this time also I will give a surpriseâ€� he added.

19,Xerox looks at increase in sales,"DELHI: Xerox Modicorp is planning to introduce about 20 products--copiers, printers and multi-functional devices--which are expected to push the company''s sales to well over $110 million this year.

The company recorded sales of $98 million in 2003, a growth of 13 per cent over the previous year. Xerox holds about 72 per cent in the JV and is in talks with Modicorp to buy out its stake.

""We are expected to grow revenues in the same region that we grew last year but our profits (which the company does not give out) will grow even more,"" Xerox Modicorp MD Marcus Childs said at a press conference on Thursday.

Childs said that this year the company would have a special focus on SOHO market and it would strengthen its channel presence. Actually, seven of the 20 products its plans to launch will be for the SOHO market, the rest being in the office, graphic arts and commercial printing segments.

Last year, it saw sales from equipment grow by 39 per cent, with a four-fold growth in high-end colour business.

On the possible buy out of the Modicorp stake in the company, Childs said that talks have been on for quite some time but did not provide any details.

On the investigations against the company into a bribery scandal, Childs said the report by authorities was expected to be out soon. The government initiated investigations against the company in July 2002, after Xerox (US) informed Securities and Exchange Commission that Indian company''s officials paid government officials secure contracts.

""We have provided truckloads of documents to them (authorities). Literally. The final report is expected soon,"" said Childs.

Globally, meanwhile, Xerox unveiled redesigned additions to its key DocuTech line of high-volume printers, hoping to sustain momentum fulled by recent strong office equipment sales and historic highs in its stock price, said agencies.

They said the company, which had lost its grip on the market to overseas competition, unveiled DocuTech 100 and 120 copier printers, black-and-white digital systems that can publish up to 700,000 pages per month and cost between $77,000 and $99,000.

Sonia Gandhi was proving to be ''a failure'' in handling the issues of a vast country like India, as she was allowing herself to be led by a ''caucus,'' Pillai told reporters here.

He demanded dissolution of the state assembly, saying the UDF government had failed to live up to the people''s expectations since it was pre-occupied mostly with factional feud.

The BJP in Kerala was keeping its doors wide open for prominent personalities from all walks of life, he added.
