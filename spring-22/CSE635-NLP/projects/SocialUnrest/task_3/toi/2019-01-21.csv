0,HCU students protest rustication,"hyderabad: the hyderabad central university, after the rustication of 10 students, witnessed dharnas and rallies by several students organisations on sunday. representatives of ambedkar students association (asa) who termed the rustication as an action based on caste discrimination, held a protest rally in the campus and later a peaceful dharna in front of the university main gate. the representatives of dalit students union (dsu) and the university discussion forum (udf) also joined the asa later in the day. the agitating students said that the arrested students had denied even a single hearing and were rusticated without conducting a primary inquiry. the asa said that on january 10 the students had gone to the chief warden's office to discuss the issue of privatising the hostels by the university but the warden abused them using their caste name and also held one student by collar. however, the university officials rusticated the students on charges of assaulting the university chief warden and three other officials present in the warden and also ransacking and causing extensive damage to the property at the office of chief warden on january 10. meanwhile, in another development, the bahujan samaj party (bsp) state president shankar goud said at a press conference that the rustication of the dalit students has again exposed the oppression of sc/st students and those of other backward classes by the upper caste students. the press conference was called by the university joint action committee (jac). most representatives of the jac comprising ambedkar students association (asa), dalit students union (dsu) and the university discussion forum (udf), admitted that politicisation would only help them be heard in this democratic process.

1,Talks with PW only after all-party review of offer,"hyderabad: the government is keenly watching developments on the extremists front and an all-party meeting will be convened by the end of this month to take stock of the situation. the peoples war's offer for talks, in fact, has not come as a surprise to the government. the pw, it is said, has come under great pressure from the administration, particularly police, in the past few months. a section of senior police officers claim the extremists only made the offer to escape being hounded by the police. even though the government has said it would prefer a dialogue with the extremists to bring ever-lasting peace, senior police officials apprehend that the extremist outfit might utilise the opportunity to expand its cadre, strengthen itself and reorganise groups as was done during the regime of the late marri chenna reddy, when he relaxed the ban on the extremists. the demand of the extremists for putting an end to police action for few months, is fraught with complications. if we relax our present hold on the situation, it is difficult to build it up after the time stipulated by the extremists,'' a senior minister told the times of india. however, the government is particular that the offer made by the extremists be explored in all sincerity. home minister t devender goud will have a preliminary meeting with senior police officers before convening an all-party meeting to discuss the situation. meanwhile, committee of concerned citizens convener s r sankaran said the committee was glad to receive a communication from the pw in response to their letter. now that the pw has expressed readiness for talks, the committee expects the government to work out modalities,'' he said. the opposition has urged the government to react positively. cutting across party lines, they felt it was a good development and could help in tackling the vexed naxal problem in the state.

3,Tenancy laws preventing corporatisation of agriculture,"chandigarh: tenancy laws remain a major stumbling block in achieving corporatisation of agriculture. ''until the government changes these laws, the move to attain corporatisation will remain only on paper,'' punjab agriculture university vice chancellor k s aulakh told times news network. he considers corporatisation as the only panacea for the ills facing punjabi farmers. seventy-three per cent of the farming community in punjab possesses land holdings of less than 4 hectares. ''until consolidation happens it is not feasible to achieve the economies of scale in production. the average indian farmer, with marginal land holding, can never compete at the international level,'' aulakh asserted. marginal land holdings, he said, had lead to gross over investment in machinery, with four lakh tractors worth rs 16,000 crore already operating in the state. ''farmers must pool in resources and cut costs to remain competitive. if this does not happen in a five years things will become worse,''he said. the issue of corporatisation has remained a much debated issue. while industrial bodies like the confederation of indian industry and ficci have been rooting for the cause of corporatisation, there has been vehement opposition from farmer bodies. ''corporatisation will create monopolies and further deterioration in the condition of average indian farmer,''said eminent environmentalist vandana shiva. he recommended that farmers who owned around a hectare of land would certainly benefit from letting it out. ''farmers as such are earning marginal incomes from these holdings and they could be gainfully employed elsewhere if they lease their land to corporate houses which will increase the profitability.'' however, organisations opposed to corporatisation have maintained that in a dismal employment scenario that was no solution at all. about the government's apprehension over cultivation of bt cotton, aulakh said,''it has been experimented with world over and unless you ride a horse you cannot say you are going to fall,''he said. ''i think the pesticide industry is at the root of the whole controversy. the government too has paid scant attention to cotton cultivation as compared to maize, wheat, rice etc,''he added. the punjab farmer needed to diversify he said, and recommended urgent steps for reducing cultivation of water intensive crops by at least one million hectares from the present 2.6 million hectares. he recommended crop zoning as one of the solutions. ''how to go about it, whether through legislation or contract farming, remains to be seen,'' he said. aulakh also pointed out that the government should focus more on creating store houses and silos to avoid deficiency of food in particular areas.

4,Tohra withdraws call for Punjab bandh,"chandigarh: former sgpc president gurcharan singh tohra, on sunday, withdrew his call for the punjab bandh, which was to protest the construction of the satluj yamuna link (syl) canal, and said that instead his party would mobilise public opinion on the matter during the election campaign. talking to mediapersons at the amb sahib gurdwara in mohali, tohra said if the panthic morcha was voted to power it would not allow sharing of punjab river waters with any of the neighbouring states. he said that the question of releasing more water to haryana and rajasthan, did not arise.the morcha, he said, favoured the stopping of whatever water which was already being given to these states, and instead redirecting it to punjab farmers.the contentious issue of river waters, he said, could only be decided under section 262 of the constitution, which upholds the riparian principles. ''no tribunal has the power to adjudicate on the matter since it has been clearly laid down in the constitution that river water disputes are to be resolved in consonance with the riparian principles only,'' he added. yet if punjab had surplus water, it would not mind sharing it with other states. but the ground situation, he said, was different and the state did not have any water to share. meanwhile, morcha general secretary prem singh chandmajra said that all-party meeting, called, on sunday, for evolving a strategy on river waters and construction of the syl, had been called off.

7,BSE sets elections despite Sebi plan to bar brokers,"mumbai: even as the securities and exchange board of india (sebi) is working out options to eliminate broker members as directors on stock exchanges, the bombay stock exchange (bse) has issued a notice inviting brokers for its governing board. according to a notice issued on january 17, bse has informed members that applications are invited for filling up seven vacancies in the board for elections to be held on march 6, 2002. a sebi official has, however, clarified that the regulator may not intervene in the bse elections at the moment. however, once a decision is taken by the sebi board to ban broker members as directors on exchanges, then this election will be declared null and void. the sebi board had met recently with this issue of banning broker directors on exchange boards in order to ensure greater transparency, though no nonsenses were evolved. this was in line with the finance ministry's suggestions on stock exchange reforms. ""the board members have demanded certain clarifications on few issues and sebi has presented 4-5 proposals to deal with this issue, citing international experience. these proposals will be once again be placed before the board and a final decision will be taken later. till then, we will not take any action against the exchanges,"" said a sebi source. the sebi source added: ""we have started work on this direction, but a final report will certainly take some time since it has to be cleared by the union finance ministry."" interestingly, the regulator has already barred existing three directors in continuing as bse directors which include deena mehta, motilal oswal and himanshu kazi along with other three directors who resigned from the board. the elections announced does not include these three broker directors. the sebi move followed when top officials in the management were alleged to have used confidential information available with surveillance departments of the exchanges. moreover, the sebi report also has indicted the surveillance department of both bse and national stock exchange in connection with the rs 32 crore uti-cyberspace infosys scam. moreover, the stock market regulator has asked the bourses to amend their bye-laws and prohibit broker members from holding top management positions in the exchanges for the posts of president and vice-president. the barring of broker members from the top positions would also mitigate the chances of misuse of authority to a certain extent. sebi was under criticism recently by members of the joint parliamentary committee that its nominees are not adequately involved in bourses' board meetings. the current elections are for replacing seven vacancies, which includes the one created after sunil shah vacated the post. the bse notice issued by s.s. vyas, gm, bse, has, however, added that a formal notice of the election and the detailed programme thereof will be communicated to the members shortly. this is for the information of the members.

8,Key SC ruling on third party risk,"new delhi: vehicle owners be careful now to buy insurance policies for automobiles as the existing policy does not cover the third party risk. a constitution bench of the supreme court has held that the comprehensive policy based on estimated values of vehicles does not ""automatically"" cover the risk for which a specific agreement is essential and requisite premium must be paid to insurance companies. clearing doubts that the policy covers the entire risk, the bench headed by chief justice s p bharucha said that liability of an insurance company would be ""limited"" even if an insured person had taken the comprehensive policy. covering different aspects of insurance policies, the bench comprising justice bharucha, justice s s m quadri, justice u c banerjee, justice s n variava and justice shivraj v patil said without taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium for payment of compensation to a third party, insurance companies would be liable to the limited extent as stated in section 95 (2) of the motor vehicles act. ""the insurer would not be liable to pay the entire amount"" awarded by the motor accidents claim tribunal or any other forum. the judgment is a fallout of an insurance company's appeal challenging the delhi hc's order asking it to pay higher compensation to a road accident victim because the vehicle was covered by the comprehensive policy though it did not have separate agreement for third party insurance.

10,Troop build-up not to affect Assembly polls: EC,"new delhi: war fears and heavy troop build-up on both sides of the border may have prompted people living in villages bordering pakistan to move away, but the government does not expect this to affect the forthcoming assembly elections. three big punjab districts - gurdaspur, ferozepur and amritsar - situate along the border with pakistan. election commission officials, however, say they are not unduly perturbed by the situation, as de-escalation is likely by the time elections take place in the state. ""there is almost a month to go before the elections. from the look of things, tension would be dissolved by then, and those villagers who have moved out would have returned,"" a senior ec official said. for now, the commission is monitoring the situation, waiting to see how it develops over the next two weeks before beginning to make arrangements to hold elections in special booths for such villagers, if necessary. the official said if the build-up of troops on the border continued, polling would be held wherever the voters were. district officials in the state are on the job, assessing how many people have left their homes for places away from the border. ""we have done it before. polling has been held for jammu and kashmir migrants in refugee camps in delhi during assembly elections in that state,"" the official said. punjab, he said, would not pose a problem as the number of people who had left home fearing war was not large. a defence ministry official too said the numbers displaced were not significant. ""the build-up of troops apart, a lot of villagers have already moved away from the border in due course over the last few years. and those who have moved this time will not be difficult to trace as they shift in an area of about 5 to 10 sq km,"" he added. elections are due in punjab, along with three other states, in the middle of next month. though there has been troop build-up on both sides of the border since tensions rose after the december 13 terrorist attack on parliament, the government has refused to put off the polls.

14,Ayodhya shadow falls over UP polls,"new delhi: the ayodhya temple is inexorably becoming a poll issue again. for, if the bjp will not overtly make it one, the opposition will. even as the uttar pradesh ruling party cries itself hoarse that the ram temple is not a poll plank, main opposition party congress will not let it forget that its fellow sangh outfits are bringing it up just before the crucial state polls. the bjp on monday sought again to distance itself from the vishwa hindu parishad's 'chetawani yatra' for temple construction, which began from lucknow, reiterating that the ram temple ""was not a political issue but one of cultural nationalism"". party spokesperson maya singh, while refusing to denounce the yatra, said the move for early reconstruction was the vhp's programme. the parishad, she said, was ""a separate entity and we have nothing to do with it"". she declined comment on bjp mps vinay katiyar and swami chimayanand being part of the yatra. singh said the bjp's manifesto, which would be released in a couple of days, would further clarify the party's stand on the issue. the ayodhya issue, she said, was never an election issue but ""one of cultural nationalism and it is the opposition parties who want to politicise it."" but the congress pooh-poohed the bjp attempt to dissociate from the yatra, saying the party, along with the vhp and rss, was an ""indivisible"" unit of one organisation. accusing the sangh of reviving the temple issue at a critical juncture just before the up elections, congress spokesman jaipal reddy said they had done so time and again and been rejected by the people. ""we are again witnessing the pathetic and shameful spectacle of the sangh parivar reviving the temple issue...whenever it is election time, it is temple time for the sangh parivar,"" he said. reddy insisted that the temple was very much a poll issue for the bjp, saying what the party could not do explicitly, ""that job is given to the vhp, which is organising the yatra to create ground for the bjp"" in the up elections next month. he expressed the hope that the people of the state would reject the saffron attempt at using the contentious issue for electoral benefits. the bjp, which has been treading a fine line between the agenda of the sangh parivar and that of the national democratic alliance of which it is a part at the centre, has already indicated that the ayodhya temple may figure in its manifesto for up - not as a political issue but as a cultural one. it has, however, repeatedly sought to make clear that it will not be a poll plank. the bjp's central leadership has of late tried to play down the issue much to the distress of hardliners in the party and fellow sangh outfits. the vhp, which has set a march 12 deadline for the government to resolve the ayodhya imbroglio before it begins reconstruction of the temple, has refused to back down even in the face of the tense situation after the december 13 terror attack on parliament.

""this is a dangerous trend and it has to be stopped. party leaders have to rein in their workers and ponder over why its activists are abetting communal tension, instead of making efforts to contain the same,"" he said while distributing to the press a copy of the new manual of guidelines: ""to prevent and control communal disturbances and to promote communal harmony-2002"". workers of secular outfits, instead of taking measures to prevent communal tension, were actually abetting it and it was a serious issue, antony said, and warned that kerala would become a ""lunatic asylum"" as described by swami vivekananda, if leaders of all parties did not take immediate steps to reverse the trend. giving details of the arrests made by the police in the recent communal violence, antony said in marad, 27 arrested belonged to the bjp, 11 to iuml, 18 to cpi-m and six to ndf, a muslim outfit. in the pathanamthitta violence, 84 arrested were ndf or pdp activists, five congress, three cpi-m and one dyfi. of the persons absconding in connection with pathanamthitta violence, 96 were from ndf, 23 pdp, 33 congress, four cpi-m and 11 dyfi, antony said. he said though communal situation in the state at present was under control, ""everything is not all right"". communal tension was brewing in the state after the outbreak of afghan war and a tendency had come to ignite communal passions out of minor issues, he said. strict instructions had been given to district collectors and police and other officials to deal with the forces fomenting communal tension. ""i have given instructions to the police to take action against the persons responsible, irrespective of caste, religion and political affiliations,"" antony said. he appealed to all religious leaders to co-operate in bringing back and maintaining communal harmony in the state.

18,Arecanut traders plan bandh on Jan 25,"mangalore: nearly 250 arecanut traders, under the aegis of supari shippers and brokers association here will observe a trade bandh on january 25. they are protesting against the alleged harassment by the agricultural produce marketing committee (apmc). the association members say the apmc members are resorting to arm-twisting tactics forcing them to shift to the apmc yard at baikampady, from bunder. they said they would not shift unless the apmc makes the raw materials (arecanut) available. the president of the association muralidhar ramani said here that traders had booked 150 sites and godowns in the apmc yard and paid in advance. already, the association members have paid rs 12.5 lakh to the apmc for their establishment at the yard. ``now, the apmc has gone back on its word and cancelled trading and transportation licences''. ramani said the traders had plans to invest over rs 1 crore on sites and godowns, for which payments started four years ago. ``the letter given to the association by apmc secretary ranade agreed to meet all the demands, including shifting of commission agents, brokers, and shippers to baikampady, concession in tariffs and rent, selling price of office premises, and granting licence to 31 traders'', ramani said. he said the traders would also demand the refund of the investment they had made if the apmc still continued to harass the traders. he said the state government should announce a subsidy of rs 2 a kilo of arecanut to growers, so that the raw materials would directly come to the apmc yard and not to bunder. he said this move would ensure the supply of 2,000 bags of arecanut for traders at the baikampady yard. ramani said deputy commissioner a.k. monnappa who visited the baikampady yard along with him, was convinced that the yard lacked facilities for arecanut trading.
