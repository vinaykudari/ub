0,States agree to adopt policy on water use,"new delhi: the national water resources council (nwrc) succeeded on monday where it had failed about two years ago. at its meeting held here under the chairmanship of prime minister vajpayee, the nwrc adopted the revised national water policy having reached a broad consensus after some modifications. sustainable development of the countryâ€™s water resources and its equitable distribution is the mandate of the nwrc, which met for the fifth time since its constitution in 1983. participating in mondayâ€™s meeting were state chief ministers and irrigation ministers. addressing the meeting after it adopted the new policy, vajpayee said, â€˜â€˜this is not the end but the beginning of a new era.â€™â€™ among other things, the water policy 2002 provides for the setting up of river basin organisations by states and gives top-most priority to drinking water in water allocation, followed by irrigation, hydro-power, ecology, agro-industries and non-agricultural industries and navigation. the priorities, however, can be modified depending on regional considerations, says the revised policy. it says the concerns of the community should be taken into account for water resource development and management. the policy replaces with immediate effect the earlier one in force since 1987. union water resources minister arjun charan sethi hoped it will provide the framework for states to prepare their water policies backed by action plans. significantly, while the nwrc member-states accepted the suggestion for setting up appropriate rbos for the â€˜â€˜planned development and management of a river basin as a whole or sub-basins wherever necessary,â€™â€™ they deleted another clause dealing with institutional mechanisms. this clause provided for statesâ€™ responsibilities in regulation and development of inter-state rivers, and if parliament by law declared it to be in public interest, the centre could intervene. yet another contentious issue, that of water allocation among the states as contained in the draft national policy guidelines, wasnâ€™t taken up at the meeting as â€˜â€˜considerable differences of opinion existed amongst the statesâ€™â€™. sethi said, the guidelines will be referred to the national water board for review and for evolving a consensus. in his opening address, the pm said the revision of the 1987 policy was long overdue in view of the â€˜â€˜increasing gravity of the problems associated with waterâ€™â€™. he said the prevailing situation was â€˜â€˜forcing us to recognise water security as an over-riding national objective not only with regard to food security but also in its own independent rightâ€™â€™. he said the policy should recognise that â€˜â€˜the community is the rightful custodian of waterâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜exclusive control by the government machineryâ€™â€™ would not help the cause of community management of water resources.

1,Alcohol induced violence baffles police,"allahabad: the sudden spate in incidents of murder during the festival of holi has baffled the police. over a dozen incidents including those of murder and attempt to murder have been registered at different police stations in the district during the past four days, starting from holi eve. incidentally, the reason behind a majority of these incidents was a sudden outburst of anger induced by intake of excess liquor which has become one of the unfortunate and necessary evils for celebration of holi these days. the drunken brawls resulted in friends fighting over petty disputes, whipping out pistols and shooting their brethren down. in some cases people with no previous acquaintance picked up savage fights just to prove a point. an aged person in koraon identified as baul paswan, 75, too could not escape the wrath of the maniacs who lynched him with sharp edged weapons. later his son ruled out any enmity and could not figure out the reason behind his fatherâ€™s murder. similarly, in handia, a shopkeeper who runs his tv and vcr on hire was gunned down by miscreants who had hired the tv and vcr for watching movies. in gaughat, dinesh kumar chowdhury, 22, was gunned down by some miscreants in drunken stupor. eye-witnesses said the mob was coming at a break-neck speed on their two wheelers while dinesh was talking to his friend on the road-side. suddenly, one of the mob members lost his balance over the vehicle and pulled along the road-side shouting expletives at the residents. dinesh and his friend sunil went to reason out with the miscreant while one of his group members pulled out a revolver and shot at the forehead of dinesh. the bullet also hit another onlooker identified as jitendra hela. dinesh died en route to the hospital while the miscreants fled leaving behind a scooter (umv-7242) and a cellular phone. says dr ak tandon, renowned psychiatrist of the city, â€œexcess intake of liquor tends to end the inhibitions of a normal social person. he performs acts which are different to the usual ones and often influenced by his social leaning and group.â€� tandon further explained that the personality of a person is dependent upon two factors viz. inheretence and social learning. in mobs, the psychology changes differently. the individual in trauma behaves hysterically and performs acts according to his community and level of social learning. social scientists too attribute the rise in incidents of violent emotional outbursts to the increasing pressure of living. they claim the deviation of a man from the basic elements of nature towards luxurious means of living, increasing competition and rise in failure rates as a fallout, contributes alarmingly to this form of human behaviour. the mantra hence, believe the social scientists as well as yoga experts lies in meditation and control over mind and body !

2,"Bihar Hajis given raw deal, says minister","patna: the bihar haj committee has strongly protested the discriminatory attitude of the central haj committee towards the 1,292 hajis from bihar, who were not given better accommodation and kept at different places at mecca. talking to mediapersons here on monday, minority welfare minister and bihar haj committee chairman shakeel ahmed khan said that hajis from bihar were provided with ill-maintained aeroplanes and it was only when protest was lodged with the civil aviation department by the state government, they were given well-maintained aeroplanes during their return journey. khan demanded direct flight for mecca from any airport of bihar, preferably patna, which is centrally located. this would reduce the cost of travel by rs 10,000 per haji. he also said that a haj bhavan, construction of which was in progress at an estimated cost of rs 3.27 crore at a plot of land in hardinge road, will be ready by the year end. he said that urdu academy was given rs 70 lakh for the development of urdu language and not for paying salary to its staff. but it did nothing for the development of urdu language. he said an amount of rs 25 lakh has again been given to it for the purpose. he informed that 12 hostels for minorities are under construction in the state.

4,50 riots occurred under DF rule: Panel,"mumbai: communal riots make news only when people are killed in the violence or in police firing, as was the case in akola last week. but the state minorities commission, which monitors them, says there have been 50 instances of communal violence since the democratic front government took over since october 18, 1999. malegaon, nashik, ichalkaranji, buldana, pune, sangli, nanded, and akola are some of the places which witnessed communal clashes in the last 28 months. the worst such rioting was in malegaon in october last year when 15 were killed and property worth crores of rupees was destroyed. the immediate cause of the riots in this textile town was the rough treatment meted out by a srp constable to a muslim youngster who was distributing anti-u.s. pamphlets after the attack on afghanistan. in march last year, there were incidents of arson and burning of buses at pune following rumours of the koran being burnt in retaliation for the destruction of the bamiyan buddda statue by the taliban. nashik witnessed riots in january 2000 when an enraged mob went on the rampage following the demolition by civic authorities of an illegal structure that resembled a mosque. the mob set fire to eight shops in the shivaji market during curfew hours. ichalkaranji, another textile town in kolhapur district, witnessed arson on december 28, 2000.the root cause of the riot was the dispute between the two communities over the ownership of idgaah maidan, where namaz is offered. while the hindu groups maintain that the 2.5-acre ground is public property, the syed maqdum ali idgaah trust, led by the local councillor, claimed the maidan and constructed a wall across it. the immediate cause of the clash was the insistence of the shiv sena and bjp activists to perform a maha aarti at the maidan. in november last year, violence erupted in sangli in southern maharashtra after provocative slogans were found on a portion of the idgaah maidan wall. the mob that had gathered there started stoning passing buses, following which the police caned them. in december 2000, riots broke out in jalgaon jamod in buldana, resulting in the arrests of 60 hindus and 47 muslims. in september 2000, there were riots in nanded and at akot in akola during ganesh immersions. the last incident of communal violence was in murbad in thane district, where bajrang dal activists burnt the shops of muslim traders in the main market on the day of the nationwide bandh organised by the vhp in protest against the carnage at godhra.

5,"In calamity-prone Bihar, govt plays with relief fund","patna: the bihar government failed to create a calamity relief fund (crf) for managing natural calamities, says the cag report for 1999-2000. while every state was supposed to create the crf for managing natural calamities, the accretion to the fund was to be invested outside the general revenues of the state. the income earned on such investments and the fund invested were to be used to meet expenditure on relief assistance. however, no such fund was created. besides, of rs 273.53 crore, including rs 205.14 crore of the centre and rs 68.39 crore of the state government, made available during 1995-2000, no amount was invested outside the general revenue, the report says. the joint secretary of the relief and rehabilitation department (rrd), in may 2000, said as the finance department did not approve proposals for investment in reserve funds, no money from the fund was invested outside the general revenue. surprisingly, scrutiny of flood reports of the rrd, made by the cag, revealed that 7.77 lakh people in 1,242 flood-affected villages of 11 districts â€” araria, banka, buxar, begusarai, east champaran, lakhisarai, munger, patna, sheikhpura, siwan and sheohar â€” were not given relief during 1995-99, even as a sum of rs 2.86 crore was allotted to the district magistrates (dms) of these districts by the relief commissioner on the recommendations of the state relief committee. the dms of these districts kept the fund unutilised. incidentally, rs 5.12 crore was provided to the dms of 15 districts â€” araria, buxar, bhojpur, chaibasa, east champaran, jamui, kishanganj, lakhisarai, munger, patna, saran, siwan, sahebganj, vaishali and west champaran â€” during 1995-99, though the dms had not sent any report regarding flood. eight of the dms surrendered rs 1.18 crore, while the balance rs 3.94 crore was retained by them, the report says. the cag has also indicted the state government for mismanaging the relief work resulting in denial of relief assistance to a large number of needy people. the cag noticed largescale irregularities such as non-utilisation and misutilisation of fund, diversion of funds and material, inadmissible and excess payments, misappropriation of funds and materials, locking of funds in civil deposits and non-maintenance of accounts of the relief fund. the audit scrutiny revealed misappropriation and loss of money and material to the tune of rs 19.20 crore, while overdue advances awaiting recovery or adjustment amounted to rs 7.63 crore.

6,Jharkhand industrial policy loses its meaning,"ranchi: the much talked about jharkhand industrial policy (jip) has apparently become a â€œdead documentâ€�. while calling it so, a group of entrepreneurs maintain that despondency is setting in. naturally, not a single investment has come to this state during the 16 months of its creation. jharkhand industries minister p n singh, in a written reply to questions in a local newspaper recently, claimed that the jip is being implemented, but the â€œdespondentâ€� entrepreneurs do not agree with his assertion. the jip seems to have become the proverbial cart being pulled in different directions. for instance, the entrepreneurs who spent time and energy working on the policy, said, â€œthe jharkhand state electricity board has not notified its part of commitments made in the jip.â€� leave aside the jip commitments, the power supply has been thoroughly dismal despite tall claims made in the media. in january last, industries suffered a loss of 207 hours of power shortage due to low voltage or complete load shedding. in february, it was 96 hours, and up to march 28, it was 155 hours. how can industries function if this be the power supply position? they asked.and the state sales tax department has made defective notifications, which are at variance with the jip. what is interesting is that when a local association of such entrepreneurs approached a highly placed official in the sales tax department with a list of their grievances, they were just â€œticked offâ€� and told that they were free to move court. add to this the mines department which has not yet come out with its policy. this group of entrepreneurs said it appears that the bureaucracy and the political bosses are working at cross purposes. in short, only about 10 per cent of the jip has been implemented.

7,Theatre bandh in Bellary flops,"bellary: the call for a bandh in theatres by the bellary cinema theatre workers union on monday was a dismal flop since all theatres functioned as usual. the bandh ended up being a mere slogan-shouting feature by activists of the union. the protest held by members of the union was also a failure as the cinema theatre management, particularly the royal group of theatres management was equipped with a court injunction order that stated, ``peace should be maintained and any dharna, strike or agitation around 200 metres of the theatre is banned''''. the management of royal group of theatres denied all charges made by the union against them. they told the times of india, they were being forced to approach the court for protection from union members as the members had not given prior notice about their plans of agitations. the management also denied it was exploiting its workers. ``if the management is so hostile, how could some of the employees extend help to tide over financial constraints which were being borne by the management after the march 15 incident (when there was a theft) and offer their epf savings'''', some members of the management asked. they added that the union which was floated just a month ago was instigating employees to resign so that they would be entitled to statutory benefits by the management. the management said, the bandh call was only to target their group. ``if any statutory obligations are violated, the labour commissioner must refer it to the management and it should be discussed through a proper channel'''', b. ramprasad, the president of another cinema workers union which is in existence since the last eight years, said. ramprasad alleged that the new theatre workers union was floated just a month ago and had created differences between the management and workers with false assurances to the workers. he added, his union too had placed demands with the management and it had agreed to consider them. ``as the management is passing through a critical financial situation due to the theft of a digital sound system equipment and lenses which may cost around rs 13 lakh they had demanded some time for their demands to be considered''''. the management blatantly denied they had manipulated the theft incident. members of the management refused to answer whether they would re-admit 15 workers who had joined the union headed by a.r.m.ismail. despite the bandh being a flop, the agitators assembled near the town municipal council where a.r.m. ismail, the president of the union addressed the members. later, the agitators submitted a memorandum to head quarters in charge assistant p.acchanna of deputy commissioner jawaid akhtar.

9,176 in fray for Phulwari NAC polls,"danapur: electioneering for the phulwarisharif notified area committee (nac) elections, which is scheduled to be held on april 28, is gaining momentum now. there are 176 candidates, including 40 women, contesting the elections from 20 different wards of the nac. for the first time muslim women are in the fray in large numbers and are wooing the voters in the name of development. electoral malpractices and violence are feared in the polls as several candidates with criminal background are contesting the nac elections. close goons of an mp are lending support to a few candidates of the minorities. thus, violence and rigging are not ruled out in phulwarisharif which has of late witnessed spate of incidents leading to communal tension in the area. set up in 1978, the phulwarisharif nac had earlier 12 wards. but the number of wards increased to 20 as per the census report of 1991 which said that the population of the nac area went up to 35,126. however, the current census report says that the population has now gone up to 55,000 in the nac area alone. accordingly, the number of wards must have been 24. according to sources, election of the ward councillors of the nac will be held after a gap of 24 years. governors had dissolved its functioning several years ago following detection of financial irregularities in the nac, sources said adding that five wards â€” 5, 6, 8, 13 and 15 â€” have been reserved for women. chhotan paswan has been elected unopposed from ward no. 17. mohd ldris and shambhu singh, who had earlier contested the elections of the lok sabha and legislative assembly respectively, are also contesting the nac polls from their respective wards â€” 10 and 4. anjum ara and indu are the two prominent women candidates seeking votes from the electorate to achieve all-round development in their respective wards. while development is the main issue in this poll, each candidate has adopted a different style of wooing voters in his or her favour. unfortunately, there seems to be total lack of enthusiasm on the part of the electorate as far as pre-poll mood is concerned. however, poor condition of roads, non-availability of pure drinking water, electricity and proper health care are likely to be the poll issues this time. besides, in the name of development the nac has done nothing to bring improvement in its areas, said the local residents and they maintained that waterlogging and drainage are the major problems facing the people in the area each year.

15,Jaiswal for dismissal of Modi govt,"lucknow: expressing concern at the continuing violence in gujarat, upcc chief shri prakash jaiswal on monday demanded immediate dismissal of modi government. the bjp government, he alleged, had sponsored communal strife in the state and there was enough evidence to prove that the rss and hindutva lobby was abetting the large scale violence with an eye on the next lok sabha election. a green signal to prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) by the joint session was an affront to the spirit of the indian constitution and also to democracy and civil liberties. the act, he said, was likely to lead to conflict between the centre and state, which, he added, was opposed to the federal spirit. the bill, he alleged, was passed in a haste without giving enough time to mull over its wider ramification. the provisions, he also declared, will not help improve the situation as experience had already proved that tada failed to curb terrorism in punjab. dismissing allegations that his party was creating hurdles in the way of installation of a â€œsecular governmentâ€� in uttar pradesh, jaiswal said the party was prepared to extend support to any secular party if it could muster the support of at least 176 mlas in the 403-member assembly. â€œthe congress with its 25 mlas was not in a position to take any initiative for government formation,â€� he told reporters here. to a question, he said the samajwadi party had not yet formally approached the congress seeking its support to form the next government.

19,Purulia pangolins face extinction,"purulia: the number of indian pangolins (scaly ant eaters) have decreased alarmingly in the forests of purulia according to the current animal census in the forests of south bengal. this endangered species is only found in the mountains of the himalayan range and in the ayodhya hills of purulia. pangolins have been categorised as endangered species in red ink by world wildlife fund (wwf). the reason of this decline may be due to heavy poaching that occurs during the age-old tribal hunting festival celebrated on the night of buddha purnima, feels experts. pangolinâ€™s meat has been a delicacy for the tribals and the scales are made into rings as a charm to prevent rheumatic fever. not only pangolins, but the census conducted between february 20 and february 26, by the state forest department also finds that the number of leopards have come down from five to three in the past one year. recently villagers had killed a leopard in the jungles of purulia. â€œin the past three years the poaching has been somewhat controlled,â€� says purulia divisional forest officer, rabinder pal saini. from 40 animals of different varieties killed in 1999, the figure came down to 27 in 2000 and seven in 2001 during the â€˜shikarâ€™ utsab, he claimed. interestingly, though the wwf had passed restrictions in 1999 against poaching of endangered and rare species, surprisingly the state government is yet to ban the tribal â€˜shikarâ€™ festival, considering their vote bank.every year, about 8,000 santhals congregate in the ayodhya hills from all over india and take part in the night long festival. according to wwf reports, about 3,000 animals have been killed in the past 20 years. the census recorded 233 bears, 267 wild boars, 42 spotted deer, 39 barking deer 39, seven hyenas, 37 wolves, 10 pangolins, 18 elephants and three leopards in purulia district. the number of peacocks, pythons, cobras, porcupines, monkeys, wild hens, rabbits have remained almost the same. â€œample food including elephant fodder have been stored for the animals in the 500 square kilometres of dense junglesâ€�, said saini. another reason for the decrease in the number of animals is attributed to the massive illegal felling of trees in the hills.

22,Surrendered naxal bemoans govt apathy,"hyderabad: the plight of surrendered naxalites who havenâ€™t received any help from the government despite the promise of rehabilitation was highlighted on monday by surrendered naxalite nevuri malla reddy, who said that government apathy and police high-handedness led him to contemplate rejoining the peopleâ€™s war or commit suicide. â€œthis indifference on the governmentâ€™s part has forced me to contemplate suicide, as life as a naxalite had more dignity and honour than a civilian life,â€� he said. malla reddy, who was arrested in 1987 for a murder attempt and had spent two years in musheerabad jail, said that till date government has done nothing to rehabilitate him. he said that the truck he had bought after obtaining finance under a self-employment scheme was seized by the bank as he was unable to pay the loan amount. he said he had approached the government as well as met chief minister n chandrababu naidu on march 8, but did not receive any assistance. â€œi am also constantly harassed by the police. i am being forced by them to act as an informer,â€� he said. â€œthe harassment increases when i refuse to do so,â€� he said. malla reddy, who married in 1999, said he was finding it difficult to make both ends meet as he was unable to sell the 20 acre of land he owns in bhungiri mandal, nalgonda district, due to harassment by officials. the former naxalite, who was a member of the pw central organising committee and had joined the peopleâ€™s war in 1982, had operated in nalgonda district. he said that many other former naxalites were facing similar problems. â€œthe government keeps making many promises, but the fact is that once a naxalite surrenders, he is at the mercy of the police and government officials,â€� he said. â€œthe negative attitude of police officers and government officials towards surrendered naxalites will only fuel the movement and not lead to naxals laying down arms,â€� he said. he said that it was about time that the government realised that it should make some efforts to rehabilitate the naxalites who have surrendered.
