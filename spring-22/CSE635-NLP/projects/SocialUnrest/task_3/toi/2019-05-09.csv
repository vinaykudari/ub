0,176 jawans killed since mobilisation,"NEW DELHI: As many as 176 Army soldiers have been killed in vehicle accidents, landmine blasts and other incidents since Operation Parakram, the massive mobilisation of troops along the Indo-Pak border, began around four months ago.

Of these, 50 personnel were killed in vehicle accidents till March 15, said defence minister George Fernandes in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. Information regarding the number of military vehicles and accessories damaged was being collected, he added.

To several questions about whether troops deployed along the border in the Rajasthan sector were facing acute logistical problems, Fernandes said, â€˜â€˜Every effort is being made to ensure that troops stationed there do not face any hardship related to shortage of water and sanitation.â€™â€™

Holding that there had been â€˜â€˜no improvement in the cross-border terrorism abetted by Pakistanâ€™â€™, he said the government had decided to continue the deployment of troops along the borders to meet any exigency.

AJTs: On the purchase of the British Aerospace manufactured Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers, the minister said though periodic reports had been submitted by the price negotiating committee, the final decision for the deal was yet to be taken.

â€˜â€˜The government is keen on an early finalisation of the process. However, it would not be possible to lay down a definite time frame,â€™â€™ he said.

BrahMos: India has decided to step up trials of the advanced supersonic anti-ship cruise missile â€˜â€˜BrahMosâ€™â€™, an Indo-Russian collaborative venture, in order to commence commercial production of these missiles by the end of 2003.

â€˜â€˜The development flight trials of the missile will be further progressed during this year and next year. The production will commence by the end of next year for induction in 2004,â€™â€™ said Fernandes.

1,State govt pulls up auditors on bank scams,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has asked the stateappointed special auditors to explain why they failed to detect the irregularities and flouting of banking norms by the four cooperative banksâ€”Nagpur, Osmanabad, Wardha and Shree Satguru Jungli Maharaj in Pune.

Reserve Bank of India guidelines require that the special auditors, who are appointed by the state co- operative department, should attend all board meetings conducted by the co-operative banks. The auditors are required to prepare a quarterly Continuous and Concurrent (C & C) audit report on the decisions taken by the board and the financial transactions made the bank.

However, it is learnt that the special auditors in these banks had failed to draft the C & C report. Sources claimed the special auditors failed in their duty to check these banks when they indulged in high volume purchases of government securities. The troubled banks had not been audited in more than five or six months, sources claimed.

Questions have also been raised about the role of the District Deputy Registrar (DDR), who as a nominee of the state government is an ex-officio member of the district co-operative bank.

The DDR is assigned the task of protecting the investorsâ€™ interests and guarding against any irregularities in the sanctioning of loans and advances by the banks. Though the DDR does not have voting rights, he is expected to attend the board meetings and keep a tab on the bankâ€™s transactions.

â€œIt is clear from the securities scam that the state-appointed nominees have failed in their duty. We have, therefore, sought an explanation asking them reasons for the lapse,â€™â€™ a state official said.

He said that the banks could not have indulged in such violations had the banks been more alert.The Nagpur district central co-operative bank (NDCCB) alone invested Rs 150 crore in the purchase of the government of India securities through five brokers.

Ideally, the NDCCBâ€™s investments in government securities should not have exceeded Rs 5 crore, sources in the state co-operative department told TNN.

In the case of the Jungli Maharaj bank, the purchase of securities should not have exceeded Rs 1 crore. However, throwing all norms to the winds, the bank exceeded the limit fixed by the RBI. All the four co-operative banks are now under control of a stateappointed administrator after the RBI sanctioned the supercession of the banksâ€™ boards of directors.

2,Setback for NDA in municipal elections,"MUZAFFARPUR: The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has suffered a big setback in the municipal corporation elections whereas at least 13 out of 38 candidates supported by local RJD MLA Vijendra Chaudhary (RJD) have been elected in the keenly-contested polls.The election had turned into a contest between the anti and pro-Vijendra Chaudhary groups. A majority of candidates who had stated that they would contest for the post of mayor have been defeated.The defeated candidates recently met at the B B Collegiate School premises on Saturday and decided to go to court against the administration for, what they alleged, irregularities in the polling, particularly in counting of votes. They have cited an example that a candidate was first declared elected from ward no 33, but he was later on declared defeated by one vote.So far, the names of Vivek Kumar (a pro-Vijendra man), Samir Kumar and Maru Mardan Shukla (anti-Vijendra men) have come to the fore for the post of mayor. Polarisation of elected councillors has begun and so has begun the bargaining for the support of different winners.As the number of NDA-supported councillors is hardly half a dozen and the Congress-supported winners have maintained total silence, even some anti-Vijendra group councillors may eventually side with the Vijendra group, it is reported. The only hurdle to this group is a section of RJD workers themselves who have become active now.

3,'State govt should rehabilitate MbPT land encroachers',"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government should rehabilitate the hundreds of people who have encroached upon Mumbai Port Trust land, Union shipping minister Ved Prakash Goyal said on Saturday.

Some of the encroachers even squat on operational areas, obstructing port operations.â€œThese encroachers are backed by certain political parties which have a vested interest in allowing them to continue to squat on MbPT land,â€™â€™ said a top official of the MbPT. Mr Goyal said the supreme court had already ruled that all encroachers would have to go.

â€œBut they must be gradually removed.They cannot be relocated close to where they now live. But we must be humane,â€™â€™ he said. Meanwhile, Mr Goyal refuted trade unionsâ€™ allegations that the countryâ€™s security would be jeopardised if foreign companies managed Indian ports.

""There is no risk as such after privatisation because these companies are only here for about 30 years after which they will have to leave their equipment behind and leave. They are only providing infrastructure for the ports and the government will oversee their activities,â€™â€™ he said.

He said that India needs foreign shipping companies because the country doesnâ€™t have sufficient ships and ships large enough to handle certain categories of cargo. â€œIndian ship owners should focus on trying to compete with their foreign counterparts because the government will always prefer Indian shipping lines to carry its cargo,â€™â€™ Mr Goyal said.

The minister said that most of the foreign shipping companies that have bid to manage a terminal or even for conversion of a bulk terminal to a container terminal have entered into joint ventures with Indian companies or are Indian subsidiaries of foreign global giants.

The terminals in these ports have been given to foreign companies only for management and maintenance. They will have to pay royalties to the major port trusts, which is like the rent paid to a landlord.

â€œâ€˜And the landlord in all the major ports will continue to be fully Indian. Even key areas such as labour will be under the control of the port administration. How can the security of the country be jeopardised?â€™â€™ Mr Goyal asked.

The minister explained that the decision to privatise some of the terminals was taken to make them economically competitive.

Goyal said for more than 20 years, Indian cargo was taken to Sri Lanka to be loaded on huge mother ships bound for Rotterdam and Singapore. â€œWe have already lost crores of rupees and that is why our decisions are now based purely on economics.â€™â€™

4,Court pulls up state govt for ills afflicting PMCH,"PATNA: A division bench of the Patna High Court, comprising Justice Shashank Kumar Singh and Justice S K Katriar, while hearing a PIL on Wednesday about malfunctioning of the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), pulled up the government for allowing this premier institute to go to the seeds. The bench also asked all encroachments in the premises to be removed ruthlessly.

The bench deliberated on the report of a committee formed by it earlier to inquire into the state of affairs at the PMCH and asked the government officers to act in the interest of the society.

The bench observed that it is a question of life and death and the PMCH needs to be resuscitated urgently. The bench also nominated the senior-most secretary among those present, P N Narayan, to be a member of the monitoring committee.

Secretary of the PHED PN Naraynan, secretary of urban development department KK Pandey, director-in-chief Anil Kumar, administrator of PMC AB Prasad, superintendent of PMCH AP Singh and Patna DM Deepak Prasad were also present in the courtroom.

The government counsel Alamdar Hussain produced the report of the senior SP of Patna stating that the encroachments have been removed and that the officer-in-charge of Pirbahore has been instructed to keep the premises free from it.

Hussain also submitted the report of the PHED claiming that the department is up to its job and is blameless.

Lawyers rose up to contradict the Alamdar report on the condition of the PMCH and said that it is cursory.

The malaise, in fact, is much deeper with no medicine, no care and no emergency service. The doctors have made it a hunting ground for tapping patients for their private practice and is a death trap, the lawyers added. Calling for weekly monitoring, the lawyers said it is a shame.

Secretary of the medical education Afzal Amanullah on Wednesday informed that the Central government has given a grant of Rs 7 crore to the PMCH for its revamp. However, he blamed the doctors and the employees for the deterioration in the PMCH stating that they hardly come on time and attend on patients.

Amanullah said that the government has formed a committee to monitor the punctuality, discipline and attendance of doctors in Patna and all other divisions of the state. He blamed the employees for inhygiene, who refused to do their work and added that now it is being outsourced.

Amanullah also blamed the lack of professors for hampering the functioning of medical colleges in general. He said that there are 75 vacant posts of professors in the medical colleges in the state.

The urban secretary said that his department had drawn up a series of measures to spruce up the buildings but the finance department froze the expenditure. Justice Katriar reminded him that the freeze was on disbursement and not on incurring expenditure.

IPS officerâ€™s salary issue: A division bench of the Patna High Court, comprising Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh, on Wednesday took a serious view of the government dragging its feet on petty issues like payment of admitted salary of an IPS officer Ajay Verma.

The bench directed the state government to pay up the admitted salary dues of Verma. The government owes Verma more than Rs 5 lakh in salary. The bench also took exception to the non-payment of deputation allowance to Verma while he was in the Bihar State Electricity Board. The bench observed that this is a witness to the sloth and indolence prevailing in the government. It was also surprised that the state government was choosing to question a presidential notification relating to payment of deputation allowance.

5,HC initiates contempt process against lawyers,"PATNA: The Patna High Court constituted on Wednesday a special bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan, Justice Nagendra Rai, Justice S N Jha, Justice Radha Mohan Prasad, Chandra Mauli Kumar and Justice Anil Kumar Sinha to deliberate on the report of district judge of Patna Damodar Prasad about locking of the Patna City court by lawyers.

The bench, taking a serious view of the matter, initiated contempt process against those charged with locking the Patna City court. The bench directed the registrar general of the court to issue show-cause notice, asking them to explain why proceedings of criminal contempt should not be made against them for obstructing the administration of justice. The Patna DM has been asked to identify the culprits.

The lawyers of the Patna City court have locked the premises for the past few days to protest against lack of judicial magistrates in the City court, and they were unwilling to relent unless vacancies were filled. The lawyers, however, alleged that while there was a backlog of thousands of cases in the City court, at present only five magistrates were posted against 16, and posts have been lying vacant for over two years.

In a contempt case, the court hears the individual show-cause and then determines if the individual concerned should face charge of the contempt of court. The court then tries the individuals on the charge, and if found guilty, may sentence them to an imprisonment up to six months, or fine, or both.

The lawyer fraternity of Patna is quite agitated and is meeting in groups to chart the future course of action. President of the Patna district bar association Jai Prakash Singh, while condemning the contempt move, has called for a general boycott of courts in Patna on Thursday. Singh said the lawyers are fighting for a public cause, and it is unfortunate that the court has taken a negative view of the matter.

Member of the superseded State Bar Council Baleshwar Sharma has called the step hasty. He said the court, instead, should have focused on the problem of lack of judges and the slow disposal of cases. Member of the Bar Council of India Ramchandra Jha is also rushing to Patna on Thursday from Ranchi.

Member of the three-member special committee of the State Bar Council Keshav Srivastava rushed to the the City court to pacify the lawyers. He tried to impress that the State Bar Council would take up their cause, but the lawyers were in no mood to listen to him.

6,"Both RJD, BJP claim victory in PMC polls","PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) poll results have given rise to claims and counter-claims by RJD and BJP leaders.

While the RJD claimed that it has made a clean sweep of the PMC polls and demanded the resignation of BJP MP from Patna and Union health minister C P Thakur and three BJP MLAs representing different assembly segments of the state capital, the BJP maintained that two-thirds of its candidates have won in the municipal polls.

Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, senior RJD leader Ram Kripal Yadav and state RJD chief Pitambar Paswan claimed that at least 40 of its candidates have won in the PMC polls. â€œThere are 19 Yadavs and eight Muslims on the list of winners,â€� said Ram Kripal Yadav while insisting that the results reflect a clear defeat for â€œcommunal forcesâ€�.

â€œMany of the winners have been active members of the RJD,â€� he observed, rattling off the names of Bunty Yadav, Manju Rai, Ashok Yadav, Pradeep Mehta, Krishna Prasad Yadav and others. He promised to release by Thursday a complete list of newly elected ward councillors belonging to his party. The RJD leaders, however, remained evasive on the mayor issue.

The BJP, on the other hand, ridiculed the claims of the ruling RJD. â€œEvery Muslim or Yadav winning the Patna Municipal Corporation polls is not an RJD supporter,â€� insisted leader of the opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi. He said he and his party leaders are aware of the background of winning candidates. â€œOnly four RJD workers have actually won,â€� maintained Modi.

Modi pointed out that the municipal elections were not fought on the party line. â€œNo political leader went to campaign for any candidate. Every candidate won on his or her own strength,â€� Modi stated while insisting that most candidates won defeating RJD workers. He referred to the â€œmismanagementâ€� during the polling on April 30. â€œThere was only five per cent genuine polling as most of the genuine voters did not like to go to the polling booths due to the mismanagement,â€� he stated. However, Modi said, he and other BJP MLAs have congratulated the newly elected ward councillors and assured them of all possible help in running the PMC.

Though the Samata Party and CPI(ML) had released official lists of their candidates, not a single person figuring on their lists was able to win in the PMC polls. Even though the RJD and BJP did not release any official list, state BJP chief Nand Kishore Yadav and Ram Kripal Yadav had given their â€œblessingsâ€� to several candidates.

RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadavâ€™s sister-in-law Mansa Devi was also in the poll fray, but the election in her ward was cancelled owing to irregularities in the votersâ€™ list. Though at least 12 more results are yet to come, the race for the mayor of PMC is on. Many observers believe that it is the RJD leadership which will be calling the shots.

7,Impressive victory for BJP in civic elections,"LUCKNOW: The BJP has a reason to smile in the state civic polls in which it won nine out of 11 deputy mayoral posts, results for which were declared late this evening here. The impressive victory comes as a moral booster to the party which emerged as a poor third in the run-up to the state assembly elections.

Significantly, this came after the recent upsets suffered by it in its stronghold of the Delhi Municipal Corporation. The Samajwadi Party, which otherwise is the single largest in the state assembly, had to contend with just two seats, of Gorakhpur and Bareilly, while the BJP scored significant improvement, by adding three more seats to its previous tally of six seats.

The seats bagged by the BJP are from Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Agra, Lucknow, Meerut, Moradabad, Aligarh and Ghaziabad.

When asked to comment, Urban development minister Lalji Tandon said: â€œThe partyâ€™s victory in the civic polls has once again proved that its defeat in the assembly elections was a temporary phenomenon. This had sent a clear message to both the opposition and the party workers that the party could do well, if it put up a joint face by sinking all its differences.â€�

The partyâ€™s victory, according to Tandon, was also due to various welfare works initiated by him in his previous tenure.

However, the BJPâ€™s alliance with the BSP for the formation of a coalition government headed by Mayawati had also helped in ensuring the BJPâ€™s victory in these elections, he said adding that this was evident from the fact that the party had won by a narrow margin at various places with the support of the BSP corporators, particularly in Kanpur, Allahabad and Moradabad.

But, contrary to it, the BSP corporators, particularly Muslims, went for a tactical voting in Gorakhpur and Bareilly where SP candidates had been declared winner, he pointed out.

But, downplaying the fact, Tandon, who is considered to be an ardent supporter of the BJP-BSP alliance within the BJP circle said that the BSP-BJP alliance could work well in UP.

8,Flouting traffic rules with impunity,"NAIHATI: The local authorities in the city are turning a blind eye to the traffic rules being broken by the drivers of auto-rickshaws plying without licenses.

The vehicles need a license from the local municipality, but many of them do not have these requisite papers. The drivers also disregard the norm of limiting the number of passengers to five and at times carry six to eight passengers on a single trip.

Neither the local municipality nor the local police stations are ready to take responsibly for the current situation. â€œWe have not issued any license to the drivers. The written permission that they have acquired is not equivalent to our license,â€� said Rabindra Nath Bhattacharya, the chairman of Naihati Municipality. â€œIt is the duty of the traffic police to control the number of passengers,â€� he added.

â€œWe do not have adequate man power to tackle the situation,â€� said a senior police official. â€œThere are more pressing issues that have to be addressed. But, whenever we see a driver taking excess passengers, we usually stop them and rebuke them.â€�

â€œThe rule of taking only five passengers per trip is generally maintained. But doing rush hours the number some times exceeds to 8 on passengers demand,â€� said a city auto driver. He admitted that most of the drivers did not have any valid license for plying vehicles.

9,"Trinamul, BJP clash over bypolls","KOLKATA: NDA allies BJP and Trinamul Congress once again seem to be locked in a conflict And this time it is over the Onda Assembly bye-elections scheduled for May 31.

Ignoring a Trinamul request, made on Tuesday, not to field a candidate for the seat, the state BJP on Wednesday decided to propose the name of Gunamoy Chatterjee as its nominee. The decision was taken at the state BJPâ€™s election committee meeting held today in Kolkata.

The meeting was attended by Devdas Apte, BJP central observer for West Bengal.

BJP state president Ashim Ghosh will present the state unitâ€™s recommendation to the party central election committee which is meeting on Thursday in Delhi. Earlier, a three-member state BJP team, comprising Dinesh Joardar, P.D. Chitlangia and Sukumar Banerjee visited Onda .

State BJP vice-president Muzaffar Khan said that the party had a fair chance of putting up a fight at Onda. This is because Sukumar Banerjee, who contested the Lok Sabha elections from the area in 1998, had secured 46,000 votes. Moreover, the party has around 450 panchayat level elected representatives.

â€œSince we are better placed in Onda so far as organisation goes, we felt we would be more effective to put up a fight against the Left Front. That is why we are requesting Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee to withdraw from Onda to bolster anti-Left forces,â€� Khan said.

Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee, however, said that his party was yet to receive any intimation on this.

â€œLet them convey this request to us in writing. We can then discuss it in our party,â€� he said. He, however, took a dig at the BJPâ€™s â€œburgeoning strength in the country, including Gujarat.â€�

Idris Ali leaves Trinamul: Mamata Banerjee loyalist and All India Minority Forum president Idris Ali announced his dissociation from Trinamul Congress on Wednesday. â€œTrinamulâ€™s position on Gujarat is sending confusing signals to my workers. Moreover, secular minded people are fast becoming disillusioned with the party,â€� Ali said. Nearly 5000 Ali followers from North 24 Parganas also decided to call it quits.

Ali pointed out that the Trinamul supremo had kept silent when a lot of innocent students were being falsely implicated for their involvement with the banned outfit, SIMI. â€œMamata Banerjee never uttered a word at that time,â€� Ali said with regretfully..

10,Target big defaulters: Power minister,"LUCKNOW: Spelling out the priorities of the government in the power sector, energy minister Ramvir Upadhyay said on Wednesday that increased emphasis would be laid on checking power pilferage, reducing line losses, mopping up revenue realisation, upping the generation and providing good quality power to the consumers.

Presiding over a review meeting at the Shakti Bhawan on Wednesday, Upadhyay asked the officers concerned to catch the big sharks who were bleeding the corporation dry instead of nabbing petty defaulters.

Steps in this direction would send positive signals amongst the masses that the government was committed towards wiping out the irregularities at the top, he said.

Expressing displeasure over the low rate of revenue realisation, the minister said realisation should be cent per cent, for unless this was done the Corporation would not be in a position to clear its dues. He said if the Utpadan Nigam kept its machines in order the generation would automatically go up.Upadhyay directed the authorities concerned to increase the number of payment counters as also the hours for making the payment.

Chairman UPPCL AK Rastogi said that a list of the top-ten defaulters would be prepared feeder wise and action would be taken accordingly. He said recovery certificate should be sent only after completing the process of disconnection.

11,Commerce students' arrest exposes flesh trade,"KOLKATA: The city police unearthed a flesh racket involving two university students, said to be from reputed families, and the wife of a former Central bureaucrat.

The flesh-racket thrived at the Hudco housing complex in east Kolkata, DC-DD Soumen Mitra said.

The detective department laid a trap after receiving a tip-off and after a raid, two post graduate commerce students of Calcutta University and the bureaucratâ€™s wife were held. The police said the two girls were bright students, but had taken to earning a fast buck from prostitution.

They allegedly used to work during college hours, from 10 am to 4 pm. The deputy commissioner of detective department said that one of the girls lived at Jodhpur Park, while the other stayed at Bapuji Nagar in Barrackpore. During investigations, the police learnt that the father of one girl is a senior officer at the ordnance unit at the Cossipore Gun and Shell factory.

During investigations, the police also unravelled the code words used in the racket. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the clients would inquire about â€˜dotcoms,â€™ which is a code for the girls.

The bureaucratâ€™s wife was involved in supplying girls to clients. The girls reportedly earned anything between Rs 3,500 and Rs 5,000 per encounter.

12,Riots politically motivated: Muslim board,"VADODARA: A six-member team of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) visited the city on Wednesday to speak to riot victims and assess the progress of rehabilitation work and the allegations of atrocities committed by the police.

The team had earlier visited Godhra, Lunawada and Ahmedabad. They plan to submit a detailed report to the president and the prime minister on the situation here.

Board secretary Abdul Rahim Quereshi visited the Memon Jamatkhana under the aegis of the Anjuman-e-Imdadi Bahami relief committee and held talks with community members here.

He called for peace and urged people not to get provoked. He also said that the state government should suspend police officials in areas where riots are still on.

The AIMPLB members said that they want peace to return to the state at the earliest and that the state administration should work whole-heartedly to bring back normalcy.

""The riots were neither against the Hindus, nor the Muslims. But they were initiated to save a political party and ensure its continuation in power,"" they said.

The members also requested riot victims to return to their homes. However, the victims said they have lost confidence in the police force and are afraid of returning.

The members plan to submit a report to the president and the prime minister, wherein they would chalk out their demand for peace and speedy rehabilitation of the community here.

The AIMPLB members included Maulana Jalaluddin Ansar Umari, Maulana Mohammed Fazuli Rahim Mujaddidi, Maulana Abdul Qauuam, Haffiz Shakeel, Dr Hilal and Mohammed Shaif Madani, a member of the Jamat-e-Islamia Hind.

13,"Easy to make, crude bombs are a favourite with rioters","VADODARA: Made from readily available material, effective in creating a scare and, sometimes, lethal - crude bombs seem to have become a handy tool for miscreants. The city police found a large number of such bombs during search operations.

While the term ""bomb"" may make the common man wary, police officers say these are simply the handiwork of ""ingenious people"" who use common sense and harmless looking items for lethal purposes. Fire crackers, nails, glass, gelatin sticks, detonators, tobacco tins, thin gauge pipes and gunpowder form the ingredients for the purpose.

The city police have so far detected two ""factories"" manufacturing crude bombs and has recovered crude bombs from three different locations in the city. Besides this, sources say, they recovered unexploded ""bombs"" on many occasions.

Says a police official, involved in an investigation, on the recovery of such a bomb, ""The recipe for making bombs is very simple and even a common man can make one. The most common method is that of using a tobacco tin for the purpose. Such bombs are commonly used in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.""

The officer pointed out that miscreants put a matchbox or a similar container stuffed with explosives inside a tin. The wicks used in fire crackers are then embedded in the explosive and wound tightly with strings. The explosive is then inserted in a tobacco container along with nails and glass pieces.

""When the wick is lit and the spark reaches the explosive, there is a massive explosion. This bursts the tin, and the nails and glass pieces, or splinters, are thrown around. They injure people and on entering a vital organ can occasionally lead to a person''s death,"" says an official.

What has alarmed the city police is the use of gelatin sticks or nitroglycerine. This explosive, usually used for mining, was found in the walls of a large mosque in Koyali. On Tuesday, it was found in a crude bomb recovered from Old Padra Road.

J P Road police inspector Kiritsinh Jhala said that the bomb found on Old Padra Road had a broken gelatin stick and a detonator inside it. ""Gelatin sticks are not available freely in the market and one needs a licence to use them,"" he says.

Officials point out that the nearest place from where the gelatin sticks could be pilfered are the mines in Chhota Udepur. ""The explosive is used widely there for mining. It is likely that this was pilfered out by some people there,"" an official says.

Says joint commissioner of police P C Thakur, ""The explosive is used widely around Vadodara, mostly in the rural areas. Besides mining, it is also used for digging wells and for other purposes. Gelatin sticks might be prohibited by law, but they have become easily accessible,"" he says.

Sources in the Vadodara district police, however, say that the chances of pilferage are very low. ""We have not come across a single incident where the explosive was used in Chhota Udepur. It has been used for fishing in South Gujarat. However, no misuse of explosives has been reported under our jurisdiction,"" said Vadodara district deputy superintendent of police B L Parmar.

14,Teachers protest against school privatisation,"RAJKOT: The teaching and non-teaching staff of eight government secondary schools in the city and the district sat on a Dharna here on Wednesday, protesting against the state education department''s plans to hand over these schools to private trusts mostly owned or managed by the RSS. The agitators also resorted to a road blockade.

Of these eight schools, three are from the city and the remaining from other parts of the district.

The department has asked the teaching and non-teaching staff to fill up forms indicating whether they would like a transfer to the private trust-managed schools. The staff received the forms on Saturday, the last school working day of the academic year, leaving little scope for them to protest, teachers said.

The district education office has issued a circular to these schools, asking them to send a representative and inform the DEO''s office about the decision of the staff on the transfer, teachers told TNN.

The teachers alleged that these trusts have the indirect backing of the ruling BJP.

Sources said the Gondal government school was being transferred to a trust managed by a former president of the Gondal municipality which was under the control of the BJP. Another school at Dhoraji was being given to a trust in Nanivavdi and in which a former BJP MP has close connections.

The teachers said in a statement that with the handing over of these school to private trusts, education would become expensive.

15,STF teams arrest 11 bootleggers,"HYDERABAD: The State Task Force (STF) teams of Prohibition and Excise Department have arrested 11 notorious bootleggers and seized huge quantity of illicit distilled (ID) liquor from their possession.

During the surprise raids conducted on Tuesday on stock sales points at Film Nagar, Fatehnagar, Jungur Basti, Langar Houz, Golconda and Dhoolpet, the STF teams arrested Shakar, Naseeruddin, Asif, Narayana, Yadaiah, Sunder, Raju, Munuppa, Laxman Singh and Dilip Kumar and seized 30 litres of ID, 3235 ID sachets and destroyed 3,300 litres of FJ wash and six running stills.

16,'Implement child abuse laws effectively',"HYDERABAD: A number of laws passed by the central and state legislatures to curb exploitation of children should be followed up with effective implementation, Governor C Rangarajan has said.

The Governor was inaugurating a childrenâ€™s special session organised by Unicef and the department of women and the child welfare on Wednesday.

The governor said that after the country ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1992, shocking instances of child abuse and exploitation had been exposed.

He also wanted greater allocation of resources for health care, education and nutrition of children, which, he said, would have a synergic effect.

Sketching the magnitude of the problem, Rangarajan said that out of every 100 children born in India, 63 births were not registered, 25 left without immunisation against disease, 16 had no access to drinking water, and 15 never went to school.

The governor said the objectives of reducing the spread of preventable diseases, creating better educational opportunities, providing better sanitation and enhancing nutrition levels could be achieved only through a coordinated effort by the government and NGOs with the support of Unicef.

Responding to a remark from a child facilitator that the budget allocation for women and child welfare was much less in India than in other nations, women and child welfare minister S Saraswati said, â€œAs against the allocation of 3.5 per cent of the budgetary funds allocated to women and child development in our country, other countries allocate about 5.5 per cent.â€�

Though funding has been increased from Rs 302 crore to Rs 397 crore this year, it needed to be further enhanced as there was a perceptible increase in nutritional deficiency-related diseases among mothers and infants, she said.

19,Modi's ministers complain about continuing riots,"GANDHINAGAR: For the first time since the communal disturbances began in Gujarat on February 27, several top Cabinet ministers expressed apprehensions about the continuing violence and the inability of the administration to control the situation.

The ministers, including industry minister Suresh Mehta, who is No. 2 in the Cabinet, water resources minister Narottam Patel, finance minister Nitin Patel, energy minister Kaushik Patel and social justice and empowerment minister Fakir Vaghela raised the issue at Wednesday''s weekly Cabinet meeting here.

Mehta, who fired the salvo, wanted to know why K P S Gill was appointed security adviser and what would be the latter''s brief. All the ministers strongly felt that the BJP''s image was taking a downward turn as a result of the ""inability"" of the government to control the situation.

They pointed out that both Prime Minister A B Vajpayee and Union home minister L K Advani had said that the riots were a ""blot on the face of the party"". ""How should one explain to the ordinary party workers when such statements are made by the central leadership? What is the meaning of such statements?"" asked several ministers.

The ministers, expressing concern on the law and order situation, said the effectiveness of the police was going down, the business community was getting disillusioned and there was virtually no combing operations in areas which are known to be hot-spots of tension. They said, everything possible should be done to stop the violence.

The CM, say sources, was on the defensive but explained that combing operations would begin soon and the process of identification of the culprits responsible for the latest round of violence has already begun.

Coming out of the Cabinet meeting, a senior minister told TNN on the condition of anonymity, ""We said there should be enough preparedness to fight the difficult situation rising out of the disturbances. We were assured that Gill, with his commando force, would effectively curb violence. But does this mean that the state police force under our government has failed?""

20,Modi's second bid to mollify ministers fails,"GANDHINAGAR: Rattled by the sharp criticism he faced at Wednesday morning''s Cabinet meeting over the prevailing situation in Gujarat, Chief Minister Narendra Modi called senior Cabinet ministers the same evening at his residence in a frantic exercise to cool down tempers. The meeting did take place, but with two senior ministers abstaining, apparently in protest. At least three others again registered their opposition to administrative mishandling of the communal situation.

The two ministers who abstained were industries minister and No. 2 in the Cabinet Suresh Mehta and water resources minister Narottam Patel. ""Mehta was unhappy with the rather unpredictable and tough manners of Modi during the morning meeting,"" said an insider. As for Narottam, it was suspected, he did not attend as Modi had expressed his displeasure over Narottam''s mentor Union textile minister Kashiram Rana calling the riots a blot on the BJP in the Rajya Sabha debate.

Cabinet spokesperson Purshottam Rupala, considered close to Mehta, also did not turn up but ministers did not read much meaning in it saying ""perhaps he had some important work"". Lately, he has emerged as the most powerful person, next only to Modi, in the Cabinet.

Ministers of state, who were kept out of the meeting by Modi, expressed their unhappiness over the way in which Modi was seeking to ""sideline"" them. ""We should have been called. Was our view not important? We could have discussed the situation in greater length,"" said an MoS.

""The issues discussed included the failure of the police to deal with the communal situation in Ahmedabad; how to cope with the deteriorating image of the state BJP because of the failure; and what powers are to be given to KPS Gill, made security adviser to the CM,"" the Cabinet minister said.

Those who spoke included social justice minister Fakirbhai Vaghela, health minister Ashok Bhatt and energy minister Kaushik Patel, who insisted that combing operations be done as the first confidence-building step. ""Initially, called to woo ministers, the meeting turned into a forum for criticism of the administration under Modi,"" the minister said.

A Gujarat government official note on Thursday sought to deny the news report published in several dailies that any heated exchange took place at the Wednesday morning meeting. But it admitted, ""The Cabinet is the platform where all policy matters are discussed. There was also a discussion on the current situation.""

The second Cabinet meeting on the same day - an unprecedented event in several years - took place even as clear indications emerged that differences between the CM and state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana reached a new level on Thursday.

The chief minister on Wednesday met former RJP leader Dattaji Chiranjit, who had quit the BJP along with Shankarsinh Vaghela, in an attempt to woo him back into party fold.

""The meeting took place in the presence of state food and civil supplies minister Bharat Barot despite Rana''s clear-cut instructions that no person from the RJP will be allowed back in the party,"" said a senior minister. Earlier, Modi met another former RJP leader, Narsinh Padhiar, in an attempt to induct him into the party, inviting Rana''s ire in the process.

21,HC issues notices to govt for CBI probe,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat High Court has issued notices to the state government and deputy commissioner of police Zone-V to show cause as to why a petition, alleging involvement of police in burning of hutments at Gomtipur and seeking transfer of the case to the Central Bueau of Investigation should not be admitted.

The notices were issued by Justice DP Buch in the special criminal application filed by Mohan Bundela of Jansangharsh Manch praying for the transfer of the investigations of the riot case from the DCP Zone V to the CBI.

The court also issued notices as to the interim relief whereby it has been prayed that the accused PSI Modi of the Gomtipur police station be suspended during the investigation.

The petition was directed against the alleged refusal by DCP to investigate the FIR filed on April 10, despite the court order, in connection with the arson, looting and burning of around 260 hutments by a mob, aided and abetted by the accsued PSI on March 1.

It was prayed for the relief that the investigation be transferred to the CBI as the state police failed to perform their duty.

It was submitted that at around noon Gomtipur PSI came in a jeep GJI-AR-5342 along with a few plain-clothes men and parked the jeep in front of the gate of Ambica Mill No.1. A few minutes later, a mob came out from the narrow lane of the Driver''s colony falling in the Amraiwadi Police Station area across the main road of the Khokhra.

The petitioner, who was right on the spot, noticed a few people carrying empty plastic bottles wearing saffron head-bands, came to the police jeep. In the presence of the policemen, including PSI Modi, they took out fuel from the jeep.

A little later another mob came from under the Kokhra overbridge along the railway track and as if on cue, the other mob which was near the police jeep, also converged on the hutments and the used the fuel to burn hutments. The hutment dwellers ran all along the railway line to Kalupur railway station.

The petitioner had moved HC earlier, for registration of the complaint dated March 7, as the police refused to register it. He submits that on April 10, the additional advocate general who had appeared in the matter on behalf of the State has stated before the Court that the complaint could be treated as an FIR and the DCP would investigate the matter. The police had then registered a complaint.

Submitting that he has been threatened for having registered the FIR, petitioner claimed that his makeshift office was attacked around 4.30 pm on April 21, by a mob allegedly instigated by the respondent to terrorise the petitioner so that he does not pursue his earlier complaint.

The petitioner had therefore contended that under this severe biased attitude of the local police, he had no trust in the local policemen and directions were required from the HC to the CBI to investigate the complaint filed by the petitioner to punish the culprits.

27,No threat to coalition govt: Tandon,"LUCKNOW: Urban development minister Lalji Tandon on Thursday dismissed any threat to the BJP-BSP coalition government in the wake of dissident activities within the BJP and claimed that it would sail through the trial of strength, slated to be held on the floor of the House on May 17.

Although upset and unhappy over the bickerings within the party, Tandon said that it would pass. Such an open revolt within the party, he said, was unthinkable in the BJP, which is essentially considered to be a cadre based party. This was mainly because a large number of power-hungry people had of late joined the party, he added.

When asked to comment on BJP MLA from Bhinga Chandramani Kant Singh, who had revolted in protest against the denial of a ministerial berth to him, Tandon said that the party was seized with the matter and would take an appropriate decision on the matter soon. He, however, ruled him out as any serious threat to the governmentâ€™s survival.

A big supporter of the coalition government headed by Mayawati, Tandon said that the coalition was fully justified and said it was done to avoid another elections in the state.

He said the criticism of BJP for joining hands with the BSP was misplaced, as the two were natural allies. While the BSP was committed for the uplift of the Dalits, the BJP too was committed to social harmony based on a concept of a society free from the ills of caste and creed.

â€œThe BJP-BSP combine can spell a doom for all its rivals, if the two go to the elections together,â€� he said adding that the two had joined hands together in UP with a long-term strategy to achieve a long-term goal.

When asked to comment on the large-scale transfers effected by chief minister Mayawati, he said it was her prerogative to choose the officials of her liking. With regard to the coordination panel for a better working of the government, he said it would be formulated shortly after the government sought the trust vote on May 17.
