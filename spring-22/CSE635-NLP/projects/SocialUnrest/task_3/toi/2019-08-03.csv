1,"Gujarat riot-hit want early aid, not elections","GODHRA: In pursuit of its objective to assess the situation in Gujarat before holding polls, a three-member team of the Election Commission (EC) on Friday surveyed Godhra, among other riot-hit areas, and the message it received was amply clear: â€˜â€˜Relief first...who cares about polls?â€™â€™

The team first surveyed the historic town of Champaner, where most residents diverted from the issue of elections to their miseries. The team also visited Halol, where several factories were gutted. The team was in a rush to move ahead, but factory owners insisted they visit each unit to get a clear picture of the extent of damage.

At Kalol, NGOs took the lead in representations against early polls. Member of a Delhi-based NGO said, â€˜â€˜Many havenâ€™t returned home yet. How will they vote? There is no point having polls when people arenâ€™t getting food and other amenities.â€™â€™

3,Shakeel threatens minister in Modi govt,"AHMEDABAD: The exposeâ€™ by the Mumbai crime branch of the nefarious nexus between Bollywood stars and the underworld snowballed into Gujarat. The minister of state for fisheries in the Narendra Modi government, Purushottam Solanki, received a threat call from Dubai-based gangster Chhota Shakeel on the phone at his official residence in Gandhinagar. The call came around 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday and was received by Solankiâ€™s commando Narottam Devshankar Dhandhaliya who also lodged a complaint at a police station in Gandhinagar on Thursday.

According to the complaint, the caller, identified himself as Chhota Shakeel from Dubai and was speaking in Hindi. â€˜â€˜He first showered expletives and then said â€˜...tum dono ko uda doonga (I will kill you both)â€™,â€™â€™ the police said.

The caller also left behind a number: 00971506947628, supposed to be that of Dubai. A case was lodged under sections 506 (2) and 507 of the IPC and the police are investigating.

4,Govt has to ensure credible polls in J&K,"NEW DELHI: The decision to hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir in a four-phase process beginning in August and ending in mid-October is only the beginning of a new phase in the Kashmir crisis.

Separatist groups remain adamant about not participating in the process and the challenge before the state and Union governments is to either persuade some of these elements to participate or to use the conduct of â€˜â€˜free and fairâ€™â€™ elections to marginalise them.

The government hopes the technical steps outlined by the Chief Election Commissioner James Lyngdoh on Friday will ensure credible elections and show up those who oppose the elections as being against the restoration of normality here. Disgruntled separatists, on the other hand, feel their boycott will rob the election of its credibility. There is still time for the government to persuade some of the separatists to relent, but with the election commission announcement, the time for decisions is finite.

In holding the elections now, the government has met the constitutional requirement for a new assembly before October 17. It has also addressed an American and international community requirement, spelt out recently by the US Secretary of State Colin Powell to get on with the process of pulling back forward deployed troops on the Indo-Pakistan border as quickly as possible. But it has not yet dealt with the vital requirement of resolving the political crisis that afflicts the state.

The All Parties Hurriyat Conference has declared that its position opposing elections remain unchanged and its chairman Abdul Ghani Bhat has said that the executive of the outfit will meet in a few days to formalise its response. The separatist leader who was closest to throwing his hat in the electoral ring -Shabbir Shah -declared on Friday that he will stay away from the electoral process because the government has not accepted his demand for a dialogue.

The governmentâ€™s challenge now is to make the elections as credible an exercise as possible.

5,"Peace a must for polls, India tells French foreign minister","NEW DELHI: Visiting French minister Dominique Villepin had been sensitised on the need for peace during the J&K elections, external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha said in a joint Press appearance with him barely hours after the announcement of election dates in J&K.

India reiterated the conditions for resumption of dialogue with Pakistan and said peace was dependent on what Pakistan did. Asking Pakistan to eschew violence in the run-up to the elections in J&K, India said there had been an attempt in the past months to target political activists in the state.

While Villepin emphasised the need for dialogue, he also spoke of the â€˜â€˜conditionsâ€™â€™ necessary for dialogue and said it could not be â€˜â€˜imposedâ€™â€™ but had to be bilateral and as a result of the â€˜â€˜willâ€™â€™ of both the countries.

Villepin said that while France did not intend to interfere, in todayâ€™s world regional crises were no longer limited.

6,Chandmani workers allege govt indifference,"KOLKATA: Workers of the controversy-ridden Chandmani Tea Estate near Siliguri where two persons were killed in police firing on June 26, have alleged that the West Bengal government is willfully ignoring the illegal shut-down of the garden.

â€œDespite the violation of statutory obligation that requires a consent from the government before declaring a closure, the state government did not declare the closure illegal,â€� leaders of the Chandmani Cha Bagan Majdoor Morcha said.

The labour alliance questioned the promised commitment of the CPM-led government which had repeatedly assured workers of safeguarding labour against illegal and improper action of employers.

Pointing out that additional labour commissioner of West Bengal A.N. Das had called a tripartite meeting to work out an end to the impasse, the CCBMM leaders alleged that the management did not care to send any representative to the meeting.

In a press communiquÃ©, the CCBMM stated that â€œthe management itself in a letter to the state labour department admitted that closure of the tea estate without notice is illegal. It also admitted that substantial amount of payables to the workers are in arrearsâ€�.

Lambasting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharjee, CCBMM president Vincent Oraon said: â€œUrban development minister Ashok Bhattacharjee and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee are supporting the closure.

The union is demanding immediate settlement of the dues of workers of Chandmani and wants the government to declare the closure notice illegal.

The additional labour commissioner principally agreed that the two demands are justified, Oraon stated.

7,CM has lost moral right to rule: Badal,"CHANDIGARH: Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal said that Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, had lost the moral right to continue in office, after his government had been indicted by chief justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court, AB Saharya, in the multicrore PPSC cash-for-job scam.

In a statement here, on Friday, Badal said the chief justiceâ€™s observation that ADGP AP Bhatnagarâ€™s transfer, along with the team assisting him in the Intelligence wing, was tantamount to hampering the inquiry in the case. He added that this was a â€˜â€˜damning indictment of the working of the Amarinder Singh governmentâ€™â€™.

He said the chief minister owed an explanation to the people of the state why did he intend to hamper the inquiry into a case which the government was â€˜â€˜show-casing as its greatest achievementâ€™â€™.

Since the transfer of Bhatnagar and other senior officers was done at the behest of the chief minister, who is also the Home minister, Amarinder was personally responsible for hampering â€˜â€˜the pursuit of truth and justiceâ€™â€™ in the case.

This, he said, was done clearly to prevent them from â€˜â€˜exposing the involvement of the chief ministerâ€™s office in the disappearance of Rs 2 crore from the bank lockersâ€�.

The SAD president questioned the CMâ€™s motive behind the transfer of Bhatnagar who had earned such rare praise from the chief justice for his contribution in the inquiry.

He asked why were Bhatnagar and his team-mates prevented from conducting a detailed interrogation of bank manager KS Bedi, who could have possibly held the key to the missing crores of rupees.

Badal said Ravi Sidhuâ€™s catch was not part of the planned success of the Amarinder Singh government but was instead a chance breakthrough provided by the then Intelligence officials, who were subsequently made helpless in the case.

8,30 held in Ludhiana inter-locality clash,"Ludhiana: The police arrested 30 people here on Thursday night after two groups of residents from different localities clashed. The drama lasted well into the night.

It began with some youngsters of Partap Nagar and Baazigar Mohalla getting into a dispute at Basant park, in the process of which a youth of Baazigar Mohalla was beaten up. At around 11 pm over 100 men from Baazigar Mohalla reached the house of one of the boys in Partap Nagar and began pelting it with stones, breaking the window panes.

The boyâ€™s father, Kirpal Singh Sandhu, fired some gun shots into the air and dispersed the mob.

Later, the aggrieved parties reached Basant police post to lodge a complaint but were told to go to the police station under which their locality fell. The Baazigar Mohalla men got agitated and demanded that the other party be handed over to them. By that time a mob had gathered outside and broke down the main gate in an effort to get in.

Police sources said over 10 police control room motorcycles were called in to chase away the mob and free the 70 men, including ex-MLA Hira Singh Gabria and police employees, trapped inside the post. They said 10 people were rounded up from the spot and 20 were picked up from their houses in Baazigar Mohalla. The arrests were completed by 3 am.

The police has filed three different FIRs in the case. Police sources informed that cases had been filed against both parties.

However, residents of Baazigar Mohalla are far from happy. Mukhtiar Kaur, a housewife, showing her badly bruised shoulder, alleged that the police had barged into her house by breaking open the door, injuring her in the process. They had been looking for those involved in the clash but the youngsters they rounded up were innocent, she claimed.

9,All-party team can take up flood issue: Speaker,"PATNA: The Speaker Sadanand Singh in a written reply to the Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Sushil Kumar Modi said on Friday that the all-party delegation which scheduled to meet the Union minister of food and civil supplies Sharad Yadav on Saturday can also take up the issue of the prevailing flood situation in the state.

Modi in a letter to the Speaker had urged to postpone the all-party delegation to meet the Union minister on Saturday on foodgrain procurment by FCI in Bihar. Modi said that as the state is facing both flood and drought situation, the visit should be postponed.The Speaker in his letter had informed that he had contacted the water resources minister Jagadanand Singh on the issue. The water resources minister had stressed that Sharad Yadav can play a key role in procuring some help to the state.

â€œIn my opinion it will not be appropriate to postpone the all-party delegation, now when the programme has been finalisedâ€�, he remarked requesting Modi to participate in it. â€œIf you cannot go yourself, you can send somebody on your behalfâ€�, the minister insisted. The Speaker also noted, that on July 29 he had convened a meeting of various parties, officials and ministers on the question raised by a BJP leader Prem Kumar related to irregularities in food procurement by FCI at minimum support price to the farmers in Bihar.

A formal inivitation was also sent to Modi, but for some reason or other he did not turn up in the meeting.

10,"Transporters' strike on, govt refuses to yield","PATNA/RANCHI: The state government toughened its stance against the striking transporters on Friday after the latter rejected the appeal of chief minister Rabri Devi to withdraw strike in public interest.

The state transport department is determined not to roll back the hike in road tax. Department sources claimed that even after the hike, the road tax is only one-third of that charged from the commercial vehicles in Punjab.

Moreover, the hike in road tax in Bihar has been made after eight years and the transporters should not have any grudge against the state government, said transport commissioner N K Sinha. The hike would result into an increase of only 3.2 paise per kilometre in bus fare, he added.

In order to cope with the situation, the state has approached West Bengal to provide buses to maintain communication in flood-affected North Bihar districts.

On Thursday, the state government had sent an SOS to Uttar Pradesh to provide buses.

It has been claimed that 65 buses are being plied in Patna district under the arrangements made by the transport department. This figure will be increased to 90. The striking transporters or any person attacking the buses or stopping them from plying would be arrested under the National Security Act, Sinha added.

The state government is also keeping a tab on the worsening economic situation due to the strike. Tractor trollies or any private vehicle can be used for carrying vegetables from rural areas for marketing as no tax would be realised from them at this juncture, officials said.

On the other hand, the Bihar Motor Transport Federation is firm on continuing the strike which has started crippling the economy. The prices of potato, onions, fruits, vegetables and other items have soared as trucks bringing them to the city have stopped coming following the strike.

In Ranchi, the transportersâ€™ strike has badly affected passengers of Jharkhand who travel in hundreds to Patna and other cities of Bihar everyday.

Passengers at the Khadgara bus stand at Kantaltoli, from where at least 100 buses leave for various cities in Bihar, had a harrowing time since no bus came from Bihar in the last two days. The same situation prevailed at the Ratu Road stand.

11,More Central govt offices to shift from state,"KOLKATA: The bifurcation of Eastern Railway and trifurcation of South Eastern Railway are not the only cases that will lead to the flight of offices and personnel from the city. There are other Central government offices that may shift to neighbouring states soon.

A proposal to shift the Damodar Valley Corporation headquarters to Ranchi is hanging fire. The DVC board is meeting in New Delhi next week. â€œIt is possible that the shifting of the headquarters might be discussed in the meeting,â€� a senior DVC official said.

Immediately after the formation of Jharkhand, the demand was raised that the headquarters of DVC be shifted to Ranchi as most of DVCâ€™s projects are concentrated inthat state.

The Customs and Central Excise department has also initiated a restructuring of its departments. It has already shifting its checking centre in the city to Raxaul in north Bihar. The centre mainly handles cargo from Kolkata and Haldia ports bound for Nepal. The department has also abolished 2,001 group C and D posts.

While customs and central excise chief commissioner AK Chhabra said the revamp was â€œinevitableâ€�, employees were vociferous in their protest.

Nearly 300 members of the Customs Group D Officersâ€™ Union demonstrated in front of Customs House (eastern region) in Kolkata on Friday to protest against the proposed restructuring.

â€œThese moves will hamper West Bengalâ€™s economy,â€� said Ashish Chakraborty, general secretary of the Customs Group D Officersâ€™ Union.

At Coal India too, reports of a possible shift of the headquarters to Ran-chi is doing the rounds. â€œThe Bihar lobby is definitely at work. Even the rail bifurcation issue began as rumours and turned out to be true,â€� top level CIL sources revealed.

â€œShifting CILâ€™s headquarters will be a logistic disaster as all the activities are centred around Kolkata,â€� they said. Apart from the booking of wagons, even the Coal Mines Provident Fund is based in the city.

Shifting the DVC head office will be equally tough as the DVC was set up under an act of Parliament. The head office cannot, therefore, be shifted by issuing an ordinances. â€œThe shifting of the headquarters will necessitate an amendment in the exist-ing DVC Act,â€� a company spokesman said.

12,Students protest coaching ban,"LUCKNOW: Even as the state government issued a notification revising the registration fee structure for coaching institutes on Friday, by amending rule 4 and 5 of the UP Coaching Regulation Rules-2002, in an interesting development, a section of students have protested the provision to ban university and degree college teachers from teaching in coaching institutes for competitive examinations, saying it would deprive them off an opportunity to get expert guidance.

Meanwhile, higher education minister Om Prakash Singh said that the registration fee has been revised. Now, the registration fee will be Rs 4,000 for up to 20 students; Rs 10,000 for between 21 to 50 students and Rs 50,000 for over 50 students in a coaching institute. Students have said the ban on will adversely affect their career prospects.

13,Requesting ‘sympathy as per the rules’,"LUCKNOW: Its definitely not a cakewalk getting into Lucknow Universityâ€™s undergraduate courses. Ask the students themselves. Let alone those with a high percentage, even those with recommendations from the â€˜biggiesâ€™, do not seem to be working for candidates desperately seeking admission to various under-graduate courses at LU. In fact, till date, the varsity authorities have received over 100 recommendation letters and phone calls, to try and pressurise the authorities into admitting their candidates.

Right from an unidentified called claiming to be a personal assistant in the defence ministry, to an official of the home ministry, Members of Legislative Council and Assembly, ministers, journalists and even mafia dons and criminals â€” recommendations have come in the form of requests, pleadings, lucrative offers and even life-threats. What has been a significant factor so far, is that while the BJP ministers and leaders have been generous in issuing recommendation letters, there has been not a single case of pressure or interference from the BSP ministers.

A caller claiming to be the BJP MP from Gonda, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, has been repeatedly calling up LU authorities for the past several days and pestering them for admission of his candidate into BSc-I. He even had the temerity to threaten LU officials if the cut-off percentage for the merit list did not come down by one per cent, so that his candidate could secure admission without any hassles.

Similarly, senior minister in the state government, top bureaucrats and even some officials of the Raj Bhawan have sent recommendation letters requesting LU authorities to consider the case â€˜sympathetically, as per the rulesâ€™.

Mafia-turned politicians (mostly former student leaders of LU), petty student leaders, fake journalists having recommendation letters of an MLC and senior IAS and IPS officers in their beacon-sporting Ambassador cars could be seen making rounds of the counselling venue at the UPSC building.

However, none of them have been obliged so far by the LU authorities, claimed officials, ascribing credit to Prof RR Singh, director (admissions).

While under-graduate courses have been by and large â€˜cleanâ€™, post-graduate admissions too, were carried out relatively in the same manner, save for an incident in which, there were illegal admissions in a course run by the botany department. In the admissions to the law courses too, pressure came from senior IPS officers, disclosed LU officials. However, sources in Lucknow University did conceded, that the possibility of â€œout of the wayâ€� admissions cannot be ruled out.

There are also reports that some student leaders have managed to secure admission for their candidates in some courses, by appending fake caste and weightage certificates and even fake mark-sheets. Though no specific case has come forward till date, LU officials said that there will be a sample cross-checking of mark-sheets and caste certificates.

14,Govt tightens scholarship rules,"HYDERABAD: As part of efforts to streamline the award of scholarships to the backward classes and Scheduled Castes and Tribes, the government has brought in sweeping changes in the procedures followed in sanctioning, drawal and disbursement of pre and post-matric scholarships to students of the downtrodden communities.

The changes come in light of the multi-crore scholarship scandal exposed in the state recently and they will become operational with immediate effect.

Accordingly, the government has declared the deputy directors the social and tribal welfare officers of the respective districts as the drawing and disbursing officers for the post-matric scholarships in the case of all recognised institutions, whether in the government or private sector.

Unlike previous years, when only the welfare departments were involved in the disbursal of the scholarships, the government has made several departments including the higher education, school education, medical & health, labour, employment and finance a part of the scholarship sanction and disbursal, giving specific tasks to each department.

The school and higher education departments would forthwith give the list of institutions, fee structure and other related issues. Besides, under the new guidelines, a provision has been made to retain the SSC certificate of students with the respective institutions to ensure that no irregularities such as applying for scholarships from more than one institution take place.

The departments on their part would assess the budgetary requirements for each district and release them, in addition to preparing quarterly statements.

The deputy of directors of the welfare departments will then refer the claims to the finance department officer concerned like district treasury officer or the deputy pay and accounts officers by further redistributing funds institution wise.

â€œThe application for scholarships would henceforth be uniform for all departments and the government has also fixed the last date for submission of applications as September 30 in case of non-professional courses, and November 30 in case of scholarships for professional courses,â€� social welfare minister J R Pushparaj said.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the minister said the department concerned would also intensify physical verification of the institutions claimed by students to ensure that scholarships were not granted to bogus institutions. In addition to computerising the scholarships list and putting them on the net, the government would also give priority to government institutions followed by university colleges, private-aided colleges and private unaided colleges for awarding scholarships.

He said that in the drawal of scholarships, priority would be given to maintenance, and then to fee, depending on the availability of finance.

After the award of scholarships, the respective heads of the institutions would credit the amount in the college account and the scholarships would strictly be released through account-payee cheques to students.

15,"Come out of slumber, CM tells ministers","HYDERABAD: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday gave a pep talk to his ministerial colleagues after the Cabinet meeting and told them to turn pro active and ensure that developmental programmes taken up by the government are converted into an advantage for the party.

Naidu is understood to have told the ministers that they need to come out of the slumber and take the lead in recharging the party cadre and prepare them to face the opposition propaganda.

â€œUnless the cadre is trained and made to effectively counter the opposition campaign, the party will not be able to cash in on the advantages of the developmental programmes it has launched,â€� Naidu told his ministers.

According to sources, Naidu was unhappy that the government was put on the defensive in the â€˜Food-for-Workâ€™ programme. While it was a fact that certain irregularities took place and the government had initiated action, the party failed to highlight the importance of the scheme and how it prevented labourer from taking recourse to migration.

With less than two years left for the next Assembly elections, the party needs to gear up and the ministers have an important role to play, Naidu said.

â€œIf the ministers can enthuse the party cadre to make success of the twin programmes, Chaduvula Panduga and Velugu, the party could gain political mileage,â€� he told them. The party will have to face certain problems during election time as the government had focussed on issues like literacy and had cut down on populist schemes like loan waivers and power reforms. Hence, it should ensure that developmental activities the government proposes to take up in next two years gets them the benefit in terms of votes.

16,14 arrested in counterfeit notes racket,"KURNOOL: The district police arrested 14 persons, who were printing and circulating counterfeit currency and seized Rs 6.60 lakh worth fake currency from them in two different cases on Friday.

Kurnool range DIG Satyanarayan told reporters that a police team, led by Nandyal rural CI Ramakrishna Reddy, arrested 11 persons from various parts of Cuddapah and Kurnool districts and seized about Rs 1 lakh fake currency from them. Three more accused in the case are absconding, he added.

He engaged five others - J Srinivasulu, D Ravindranath, T Veeramohan Reddy, D Harinath and TB Jayaprasad - all from Proddaturu, to make fake currency.

One of the accused, Srinivasulu, was working with a web portal in Hyderabad. He joined the gang as Ravindranath and another person Jaganmohan Reddy approached him to assist them in preparing fake currency. Another person S Chandrasekhar Reddy of Proddaturu also assisted the gang.

Meanwhile, fake currency was put into circulation by T Tirupalaiah, A Veera Reddy and D Veera Swamy of Nandyal in Kurnool district. The police arrested all the gang members except the kingpin Nageswar Reddy, Jaganmohan Reddy and S Chandrasekhar Reddy.

17,Guwahati bandh peaceful,"GUWAHATI: The 12-hour bandh called by the Guwahati city unit of AGP as a mark of protest against the brutal killing and gang rape of an eight-year-old girl Barnali Dev in the city last month passed off peacefully despite efforts being made by the ruling party workers and the administration to foil the bandh.

With most of the commercial establishments, banks and educational institutions remaining closed, the bandh was mostly successful and peaceful, though Congress workers and members of NSUI tried to force open some of the shops in Ganeshguri area with the city police turning a blind eye.

Former minister and AGP General Secretary Chandra Mohan Patowari said that the action of the ruling party workers was in complete violation of all democratic norms. R N Kalita, former minister and President of the Guwahati unit of AGP said that the success of the bandh despite all undemocratic steps taken by the ruling party shows the rejection of the party by the people.

He said they had called the bandh to protest the killing and rape of the eight-year-old girl, poor conditions of the roads, acute scarcity of drinking water in the city and deteriorating law and order situation.

Kalita said it is very unfortunate that a party, which was talking of democratic norms, resorted to all undemocratic methods, including arm-twisting of some of the industry and trade organisations by forcing them to issue statements opposing the bandh.

18,Flag rule relaxation helps Khadi units,"BANGALORE: Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) Chairman Mahesh Sharma said on Saturday that the problems faced by Gadag and Hubli-based khadi and village units have been solved with the sales of national flag shooting up after the Centre decided to allow the public to hoist flags.

Speaking to reporters here, he said sales in the units had shown improvement from January last following the government''s decision. ``But, the question before us is about boosting the production of national flags. Now only three units in the country produce national flags,'''' he added.

Earlier, Cooperation Minister H. Vishwanath, Sericulture Minister H.M. Revanna and Mines and Geology Minister V. Muniyappa apprised Sharma of the difficulties faced by cooperatives producing woollen garments following financial problems.

``I have assured them of immediate action in solving the financial and auditing problems. A few clarifications were sought. I have requested them to meet our officials in Mumbai,'''' Sharma explained.

19,Police close down Russel market by 11 pm,"BANGALORE: The teeming Chowk area near Russel Market in Shivajinagar where eateries serve hot chicken kebabs and ghee rice beyond midnight to the Cantonment''s rich and poor at affordable prices, is looking dull these days.

Life has come to a halt in this area after 11 p.m. Courtesy: Bangalore police.

``After the new DCP took charge recently, the local police are asking us to close before midnight and chasing away people who come here,'''' several hoteliers complain.

Police have a different view. These eateries have become meeting points for anti-social elements and vagabonds, they say. ``People loiter around unnecessarily here contributing to crime. So, we have come down heavily on them,'''' they say.

The hoteliers and others counter: ``Go through the crime graph of Shivajinagar police station. There is hardly any crime incident near the hotels and other business establishments -- either during the day or night. Since the time of British, this area is famous for its night life.''''

The poor people of East Bangalore -- mainly labour class and auto drivers -- get their food here. ``We complete work only after 11 in the night. All other restaurants will be closed by then. We get food of our choice here at affordable prices. Please do not snatch this privilege from us,'''' says Akram, a garage owner. Auto drivers, hawkers, lorry drivers, small-time traders and students echo the same sentiment.

``The police have conveniently shut their eyes towards live-band restaurants and bars in posh areas which are open beyond midnight. Several live-band restaurants are serving liquor beyond midnight without excise licence. There is no similar action against them. Hotels in the Chowk are being targeted by the police unnecessarily,'''' says Anees Ahmed Ali Khan, an advocate from the nearby Tusker Town. Live-band restaurants have, in fact, become sanctuaries for criminals, he adds.

Every metro in the country has late night food joints to cater to the poor and those who return home after a late night show or work. These joints should not be disturbed as long as there is no law and order problem or crimes, Khan says.

``There are no bars and live-band restaurants here. There are only paan joints, fruit stalls and garages along with hotels. At the same time, there is no extortion or robbery taking place here. Women can be seen walking wearing jewellery even after midnight,'''' adds Sidiq Alduri, a resident of Shivajinagar area.

When contacted, Police Commissioner H.T. Sangliana says: ``Our intention is to reduce crime. We will review the situation and revert to the old system if we are satisfied.""

20,JD(U) workers protest merger plan,"BANGALORE: The Janata Dal merger is getting curiouser and curiouser by the day. On Saturday, a section of the JD(U) workers claimed that the national executive had authorised only senior leader Ramakrishna Hegde to negotiate and debunked the August 15 deadline set for the merger.

Speaking to reporters, former minister Vyjanath Patil said: ``Nobody in the party is against the merger as Hegde himself has clarified. However, it is not something that can be achieved in a hurry. Besides, the five-member committee which has been making statements, has neither sanctity, nor powers to hold talks with anybody.''''

He said the resolution authorising Hegde for talks was passed before the Kanakapura byelection. ``Supporting H.D. Deve Gowda''s candidature in the bypoll was the first gesture in the step towards unification of all the JD factions,'''' he said.

Referring to the five-member party, Patil stated: ``This could only be a legislature party. It is a self-declared one and has no authority. They are only misleading people and party workers.''''
