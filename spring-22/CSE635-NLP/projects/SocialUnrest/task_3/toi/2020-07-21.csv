0,Specific class of govt doctors may get NPA,"PATIALA: The government doctors, who have no scope of private practice due to their specialisation in some specific areas, may get the Non-Practising Allowance (NPA) again.

This was indicated by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh here on Monday during a discussion with a deputation of Punjab Civil Medical Services Association.

The chief minister said that keeping this fact in mind, the government would re-consider the decision under which the NPA was abolished.

He asserted that every individual in the state would have to sacrifice something to meet the big financial deficit of the state government exchequer.

During discussion, the PCMS leaders pointed out to the chief minister that the government had been totally misled by the state bureaucracy on the issue of NPA.

The government would save only about Rs 20 crore instead of Rs 80 crore as projected by bureaucrats.

But this would affect key social sectors like the free health care delivery to the poor as the permission to do private practice would encourage doctors to lure the patients for private consultation to compensate the loss due to abolition of NPA.

The PCMS submitted a memorandum to the CM mentioning that every doctor would lose salary by Rs 4,000 to 8,000 per month which was illegal as the NPA was a misnomer and was not an allowance but pay for all intents and purposes and the pay of an employee could not be reduced.

1,Traffic trauma: Chaos rules this road,"NEW DELHI: If traffic jams are an inherent feature of Delhi, why would Chanakyapuri be an exception? Well, it isnâ€™t. Try going down San Martin Marg towards the Panchsheel-Shanti Path roundabout.

One carriageway on either side of the road is occupied by parked cars. Most belong to Jesus and Mary College students. Same is the case on Jesus and Mary Marg, where students from JMC and Maitreyi college park cars. A little further, traffic is blocked by cars that visit the area to drop Sanskriti School students.

British School is also located in the area. With more people taking this road or Ring Road, the situation is getting alarming. On 26 June, the traffic police sent a proposal to the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) to create a parking lot for 200 cars near JMC. The proposal is still pending.

â€˜â€˜They just need to remove the railings and make a ramp between the road and the pavement,â€� says deputy commissioner of police (traffic New Delhi) Arun Kampani.NDMC spokesperson Madan Thapliyal says NDMC received the proposal on 18 July, but without any layout or graphic of the proposed parking.

4,Vaghela celebrates b'day with farmers' rally,"GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat Congress chief Shankersinh Vaghela marked his 63rd birthday on Monday by organising a rally of farmers from Gandhinagar district against the recent 2.5 times hike in power tariff. The rallyists beat up and burnt an effigy of Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

The procession was stopped at Udyog Bhavan by hundreds of lathi-wielding cops, some of them mounted on horses.

A water cannon, a fire-brigade van, an ambulance and a large number of police jeeps with cops armed to the teeth moved alongside the procession till it dispersed after submitting a memorandum to the district collector.

Earlier, addressing the rally from atop a truck, Vaghela warned the government to either withdraw the price rise, which he said was done under pressure from the Asian Development Bank, or face the consequences.

â€œAugust 8 will be observed as Kisan Divas,â€� Vaghela announced. â€œThat will be the beginning of a long struggle against the state governmentâ€™s antifarmer policies,â€� he said.

Congress legislature party leader Amarsinh Chaudhary arrived late at the rally site. Party MLAs Jagdish Thokore and C J Chavda, speaking on the occasion, compared the CM with Nathuram Godse.

5,Insurance policy: Get a Hindu partner,"AHMEDABAD: Mohammad Ilyas, who runs a medical store on Ashram Road here, recently offered a 20 per cent partnership in his firm to a Hindu servant, Ashok, who used to work for him.

The card printed for the inauguration had an image of Lord Ganesh embossed on it. Now, itâ€™s Ashok who mans the shopâ€™s counter and heâ€™s the face of the business.

Several Muslimrun restaurants owned by the Chelia community in new areas of Ahmedabad have Hindus as partners.

While most of the old partnerships in the Abhilasha, Topaz and Kabir restaurants have remained intact despite the property suffering damage during last yearâ€™s riots, many new alliances have come up in the last one year.

A leading supermarket chain, Adani Ravjiâ€™s, has dropped its second name after the riots to make it sound like a business entirely owned by Hindus.

These are not the only businesses in riot-scarred Ahmedabad where Muslims have started involving Hindus in their ventures. Call it business tactics or sheer fear, but more inter-community partnerships have come up in a bid to camouflage the identity of the majority stakeholder.

â€œThe owner of a cinema hall in the Asarwa area decided to offer Hindu friends a partnership. The cinema remained untouched during the riots,â€� says a Muslim leader who did not want to be named.

Barring a few exceptions â€” like a restaurant near Income Tax circle â€” where partners have fallen apart since the riots, the trend of new mergers is more visible in the Chelia community. â€œIn a few cases, the Hindu partners did not want to take any chances after the happenings of last year when the mobs did not spare jointly owned establishments.

Hence, they parted ways with their Muslim counterparts. However, many of them are on excellent personal terms despite parting ways professionally,â€� says a Chelia hotel owner.

â€œMany of us now avoid putting up posters of our religious guru in the restaurants,â€� he says. According to him, the positive thing is that more alliances have been formed in the time after the riots rather than break-ups.

Even after bearing heavy losses, Mulji Solanki, a partner in restaurants like Abhilasha, Topaz, Kabir and Tasty has continued with the partnership with Chelia Muslims.

Echoes an office-bearer of Gujarat Rajya Hotel Federation, â€œIn some cases, the Hindu partner does all the public dealings and visits government and municipal offices to give an impression that the set-up belongs to Hindus. The real Chelia owners prefer to remain behind the scene despite having a greater stake.â€�

Among other businesses where such alliances have been formed are some footwear shops and motor garages in the largely Hindu western Ahmedabad. â€œIn Bapunagar, several Muslim shop owners have either sold their properties or have invited Hindus to become partners,â€� says a municipal councillor.

According to Ahmedabad Rickshaw Association sources, some vehicle owners in a business dominated by Muslims have started pasting posters of Hindu Gods. â€œMost of them have to ply in majority-dominated areas,â€� an association leader explains.

6,State IMA demands arrest of Verma's killers,"PATNA: At an emergency meeting of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Bihar branch, here on Monday, the doctors demanded immediate arrest of the criminals involved in the killing of their colleague, Dr O P Verma, at Danapur on Sunday. They threatened that if the culprits are not arrested within 48 hours, they may go on strike.

The IMA demanded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the dependents of the slain doctor and government job to one of the family members according to the educational qualification.

Later talking to mediapersons, state IMA president, Dr Vijay Shankar Singh, said that a delegation of IMA will meet chief minister Rabri Devi and director general of police (DGP) D P Ojha on Tuesday to apprise them of the situation. Dr Singh said that the criminals involved in murder should be given stern punishment so that it worked as a deterrent to others involved in such acts.

Dr Singh said that Dr Verma was getting frequent anonymous calls for ransom and the Danapur police were informed about it. Dr Verma had requested for security, he said. However, he declined to comment on the failure of local police to protect the doctor. ""The failure to meet the ransom demand of criminals may be the cause of his murder,"" said Dr Singh.

IMA secretary Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh said that the family members of the slain doctor should be given immediate police protection. He said that it has become difficult for doctors to work under persistent threat to their lives. He said that the future course of action will be decided after meetings with the chief minister and the DGP.

7,Interest sop for farmers,"HYDERABAD: The government is planning to absorb 5 per cent of the 9 per cent interest burden proposed to be charged on the cooperative loans obtained by farmers.

The Centre has recently announced a new scheme to provide loans to farmers at a flat rate of 9 per cent, instead of 14 per cent. The state cabinet, which met on Monday, discussed the scheme and decided to extend maximum interest benefit to the farmers.

According to sources, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had asked a group of ministers and officials to study the feasibility of giving 5 per cent rebate on interest to farmers. Naidu wanted the officials to work out details of the financial burden.

The cabinet has also extended the ban on the Peopleâ€™s War naxalite group and its frontal organisations by one more year. The earlier ban, which was to end on Tuesday, was extended keeping in view the stepped-up violence by the extremist organisation.

Meanwhile, the government has decided to set up a monitoring cell to receive complaints with regard to violations of GO 610. The cell will receive complaints from aggrieved persons and pass on the information to the government for necessary action.

The cabinet also decided to provide Rs 100 crore towards reimbursement and scholarships for SC/ST and BC students, who are admitted to the engineering courses. The government will reimburse the complete fee for SC/ST students and Rs 10,000 per year to BC students.

8,Alliance politics cannot be conditional: Pawar tells Cong,"NEW DELHI: Rejecting the Congress call for a secular coalition under Sonia Gandhi''s leadership in the next Lok Sabha polls, NCP leader Sharad Pawar has said alliance politics cannot be conditional and suggested that like in the past, it supports a leader from a smaller party.

""Alliance politics cannot be conditional. While a party has a right to name a leader, it is the prerogative of other alliance partners whether to accept it or not. We will not agree to conditional politics,"" Pawar said in an interview with Karan Thapar in the ''Court Martial'' programme for SAB TV.

He was responding to a question whether NCP would accept Gandhi as Prime Minister in the event of other parties agreeing to her leadership in a post-poll scenario.

Pawar said he did not see the possibility of an alternative to the ruling NDA in the current scenario till there was unanimity on programme among the non-NDA parties and they go to people and win their confidence ""or till the time parties supporting NDA or its allies don''t come out.""

He said most importantly, it was for the Congress to decide what its interest was â€” ""whether to project someone (Gandhi) or to provide an alternative (to NDA) and implement its slogan of secularism.""

""Once they make up their mind and there is understanding and acceptability among other parties, then an alternative is possible,"" he said.

Pawar said while the Congress would decide who its leader should be, in the case of an alternative (to NDA), ""all parties will have to decide on policy and leadership.""

9,Punjab govt withdraws college fee hike,"CHANDIGARH: After public outrage and protests by students, the Punjab government on Tuesday decided to roll back the fee hike imposed on colleges.

The hike was to take effect from the current academic session. This decision was taken at a high-level ministerial meeting chaired by chief minister Amarinder Singh where state Congress chief H S Hanspal was also present.

This decision was taken at a high-level ministerial meeting chaired by chief minister Amarinder Singh where state Congress chief H S Hanspal was also present.

It was unanimously decided to maintain the â€˜â€˜status quoâ€™â€™ in the fee structure for general education in colleges. Education for women would be free again up to the level of graduation as it was prior to imposition of the new fee structure. The last fee revision was in July 1986.

A spokesman of the government said that the decision had been taken in the interests of youth in general and especially those belonging to theeconomically weaker families who could ill-afford the increased cost of education.

The government felt convinced that the enhanced fee structure would lead to â€˜â€˜frustration and disappointment among a considerable section of people which the government was committed to supporting economically.â€™â€™

Apart from student-organisations which were gearing up for a protracted agitation over the fee hike, the political parties, especially the Shiromani Akali Dal had also threatened to support to the studentsâ€™ agitation. But, what may have clinched the issue for Amarinder Singh was brewing resentment among the Congress legislators who felt fee hike might affect their support base.

Also, Hanspal was upset over the hike and had aired his views in public repeatedly. Partyâ€™s national general secretary Ambika Soni had also opposed the hike,especially the decision to roll back free education for women.

Tuesdayâ€™s decision means college and university would have to grapple with administrative problems at a time when the admission process is about to close in the state.

Since the intake of the students in most colleges had fallen significantly, there wonâ€™t be any problem in granting admission to fresh aspirants.

11,CAG pulls up HP govt for mismanagement of SGSY scheme,"SHIMLA: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report says that the state government did not adopt the prescribed procedure for identification of the potential beneficiaries of the Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY), because of which the implementation of the programme did not ensure that all deserving cases among the below poverty line (BPL) families were given necessary assistance.

The report released for the year ending March 31, 2002, categorically states that by not fixing the annual targets to achieve the ultimate goal of coverage of 30 per cent BPL families in five years, and the shortfall of 43 per cent in physical achievement, indicate poor implementation and monitoring of the SGSY programme.

``Not watching the release of assistance by the banks to the swarozgaris and also repayment of loan indicated mismanagement of the programme. Widespread irregularities were noticed in the release of assistance to swarozgaris and implementation of the programme was not monitored as envisaged,'''' it adds.

The report says that the object of the programme was to bring the assisted families above the poverty line in three years, by ensuring that the family had a monthly net income of at least Rs 2,000. Subject to availability of funds, the effort was to cover 30 per cent of poor families in each block in five years, after commencement of the scheme.

The shortfall in expenditure on training, infrastructure development and revolving fund for self-help groups was 81,46 and 58 per cent respectively, because of which adequate skills were not developed, sufficient infrastructure not created and capacity building not fully ensured, the report said.

It also points out that of Rs 19.36 crore released by the Centre to the state government for special projects, under the scheme during 1999-2002, only Rs 2.46 crore had been spent, while the remaining Rs 16.90 crore was lying unspent with the five district rural development agencies as on April 2002.

The report says that to harness irrigation potential of fast flowing perennial streams in the state, a special project ``installation of 400 hydrams'''' of Rs 10.47 crore was sanctioned by the Centre in March 2,000. It was to be completed in two years and 3,000 farmers, belonging to the BPL category were proposed to get assistance.

It states that Rs 1.60 crore was utilised on procurement of hydrams and supplied to block development officers of nine districts, but only 21 were installed in four districts during 2000-02, while the remaining 130 hydrams costing Rs 1.25 crore were yet to be installed.

Interestingly, the report points out that a reason for the non-installation of the hydrams in Kullu and Shimla districts was because of the fact that they had already been installed in these two districts under another scheme named `''development of wastelands and marginal lands''''. Due to overlapping of two similar schemes, there is little chance of installation of 68 hydrams, it added.

13,Five arrested for duping investors,"NEW DELHI: Five employees of Bombay Bazaar have been arrested for duping more than 100 investors who were promised franchises to open general stores. Bombay Bazaar was floated last year and has allegedly cheated its investors of Rs four crore.

The company sold a dream to several persons claiming that whoever invested money in their project would get a free general store and a monthly payment ranging between Rs 33,000 to Rs 70,000.

Ajay Marwah, Amit Malhotra, Arvind, Rakesh Khurana and Atul Luthra have been sent to three daysâ€™ police custody. Luthraâ€™s advocate Ajay Jasra said his client was simply a company employee.

As per the complaint, the company is based in Mumbai and is owned by Vijay Tata. While arguing for their remand, public prosecutor Vijay Sanduja said the accusedâ€™s custody was required to unearth the conspiracy of cheating.

The accused were arrested by the Delhi Policeâ€™s criminal breach of trust department. According to the complaint given by D K Tayal, the accused held senior positions in the company and worked in Delhi to attract investors. â€˜â€˜During their proposal the accused promised that whatever money is invested with the company would be remunerated to the investors. The company promised to open shops for the investors and provide the stock for the general store in Delhi,â€™â€™ a police officer said. The company also promised a monthly payment to the investors.

The complainant, however, claimed that although the accused provided the stock, it was of bad quality. The accused also did not pay the monthly amount to investors.

â€˜â€˜When they went to the companyâ€™s office, the employees said that Tata was out of the country and their problems would be settled on his arrival to India,â€™â€™ the officer said.

Although the employees gave cheques to the investors, the same got dishonoured due to lack of funds.
