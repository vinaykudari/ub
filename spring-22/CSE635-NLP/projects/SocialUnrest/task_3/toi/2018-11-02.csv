0,New law mooted for housing co-ops,"new delhi: for a country as vast as india, the existence of 92,000 housing cooperatives with a membership of over 65 lakh persons may not come as a surprise. yet, what is surprising is that these housing cooperatives function under the same rules as those meant for other cooperatives. so when the 13th national congress of housing cooperatives meets in the capital over the weekend, an important item on the agenda will be approval for a model act for cooperative housing societies. an act which, if adopted by states, will go a long way in ridding cooperative housing societies from restrictive and complex rules which are currently prevalent. the draft of the model act is ready. it has been prepared by the national cooperative housing federation, an autonomous body under the union ministry of urban development and poverty alleviation which has also organised the two-day congress. briefing presspersons on wednesday, nchf managing director m l khurana said the existing cooperative societies act and rules do not cover the various aspects of cooperative housing. hence the need for a separate act. provisions contained in the model act concern various aspects of the functioning of housing cooperatives, among them the allotment of plots, flats or other dwelling units, restrictions on letting out, transfer of occupancy rights, exemptions from certain taxes and regulation of loan making policy.

3,Paswan for purge of caste politics,"bathinda: union minister for coal and mines ram vilas paswan said that caste and creedbased politics in the country was the biggest stumbling block in the way of progress in india. he urged political parties and people to get rid of it to build a prosperous and egalitarian society. addressing a public rally organised by dalit sena punjab, on thursday, he said that lok jan shakti party and dalit sena were striving to establish a classless society where no one would have to face humiliation and injustice for being born into a particular caste or creed. the union minister said despite having the best brains in the country, it was lagging behind, for it was still caught in the shackles of caste and divided into religious segments. he said the birth of a child in a dalit family is a curse in india as it is the beginning of his social exploitation. he said the party was constituted to bring social justice to dalits and to assure that injustice is neither perpetrated nor tolerated. he said the party's 13-point programme, which includes inclusion of right to work in the fundamental rights, equal opportunity of education to every child below 14 years, free medical facility for every child, interest-free loan for rehriwalas and labourers, a house for every poor person within five years, complete implementation of mandal commission report, proportionate reservation for dalits according to the census-2001 and abolition of keeping sweepers on contract in the municipalities.

4,Security beefed up for ‘bazar bandh’,"chandigarh: the haryana government has tightened security in the main bazaars and other public places in the wake of the congress call for a state-wide bazaar bandhon friday. the congress has given the bandh call in protest against the state government's new house tax policy. reports received from district headquarters reveal that traders' associations have backed the call, which has brought the congress in direct confrontation with the ruling indian national lok dal (inld), for the first time after the last assembly elections. the congress boycotted two allparty meetings convened by the minister of state for urban development to discuss the policy on the pretext that the government was not holding these meetings with an open mind. haryana bjp is, however, caught in the cross-fire between the ruling inld and the congress over this issue. though the bjp, whose popular base is largely in urban areas, has been very critical of the house tax policy right from the beginning, yet it has avoided a direct confrontation with the inld government over the issue.the reason, perhaps, is that it is an ally of the inld, which is a constituent of the bjpled national democratic alliance (nda) at the centre. however, the restraint shown by the bjp has proved a blessing in disguise for the congress, which took the initiative and gave a call for the state-wide bandh. interestingly, the bjp is neither in a position to oppose the bandh call nor support it due to its policial compulsions. in the process, the congress, which received a severe drubbing at the hustings during the last assembly elections, has succeeded in creating a goodwill of sorts among the urban masses in the state. a showdown between the congress and the ruling indian national lok dal (inld) in haryana seems imminent over the issue of friday's state-wide bandh called by the former against alleged anti-peoples' policies of the om prakash chautala government. haryana congress general secretary chakravarty sharma clarified, on thursday, that movement of vehicular traffic had been exempted from friday's bandh. the congress leadership has placed party's entire machinery to make the bandh a success, while the inld leadership was busy in mobilising party's ranks and file to frustrate the bandh.the inld office bearers, mlas and its activists have appealed to the traders and shopkeepers to ignore the congress-sponsored bandh.

5,Khaira launches protest march,"jalandhar: condemning the akali-bjp alliance for having failed in curbing corruption in punjab, sukhpal singh khaira, ppcc secretary, on thursday, launched his protest and awareness march which will cover 100 villages. after addressing a rally of party workers and villagers, the congress leader kicked off his march from dhaliwal village, in what is being publicised as his election campaign in the bholath constituency, where he is likely to face his old political foe bibi jagir kaur. the congress leader plans to cover all 100 villages on foot in a period of one month.addressing a rally at the launch, sukhpal said, ''corruption has become rampant; all government jobs are for sale. postings and transfers are effected only when money changes hands. the badal family has amassed enormous wealth by patronising corruption. on the one hand, the chief minister is squandering public money on sangat darshans and on the other, the state has no money left to pay salaries to employees.'' sukhpal singh said the purpose of the month-long march is to create awareness among the people of bholath constituency about the gross misdeeds of the local mla who has ignored developmental work.the roads are in a shambles, education and health services are on the verge of collapse and the local administration has been politicised, he said. sukhpal accused badal of shielding and promoting the criminalpolitician nexus.various cases, including the harpreet kaur 'death' case, the rape case involving a senior akali minister's son, giani kewal singh's criminal case and many other such cases were being hushed up, he said. he also alleged that law and order has taken a severe beating under badal, unemployment has reached new heights and the frustrated youth of punjab have taken to drugs. even the drug mafia was being patronised by some ministers, he said. pims foundation stone punjab chief minister parkash singh badal will lay the foundation stone of the punjab institute of medical sciences (pims) on november 4, and construction work will begin on the same day. the foundation stone for the project was first laid on october 1994 by former chief minister late beant singh. announcing this here on thursday, the minister for medical education and research manoranjan kalia said when the first foundation stone was laid even the pims society had not been formed. ""now, it has been set up and all plans have been completed. the first phase starts from the day the stone is laid,"" he said.

6,HPSEB blames state govt,"dharamsala: himachal pradesh state electricity board (hpseb) has blamed the state government for the prevailing power crisis in the state, which has resulted in prolonged power cuts and inconvenience to the domestic as well as the commercial customers. s n kapoor, chief engineer, system operations, hpseb told the times of india that not only has the dhumal government stopped financial assistance to the board but also its 12 per cent royalty from various regional hydel power projects is being diverted to the state exchequer. he said, because of this, the financial resources of the board have diminished to a great extent, thereby affecting generating capacity. on whether the board had taken up the matter with the state government, he said it has been discussed several times but there has been no agreement so far. kapoor said the generation capacity of the state's plants is 75 lakh units against the requirement of 90 lakh units, but due to decreasing water level in the rivers, particularly in winter, generating capacity of plants is severely affected.besides this, he said, distribution of power during winter is also affected due to problems in the northern grid at new delhi and more consumption of power in neighbouring punjab. he said the problem would be overcome in 2004, after work on nathpa-jhakri, larji and baspa projects is completed. p c sharma, a retired chief engineer of hpseb, says the state government has to look for an alternative mechanism, as overdependence on hydel plants would not solve this acute problem. in the wake of drought, the situation would worsen, he added. sharma suggested setting-up of gas-based and thermal plants, for generating more power. he however said the state government lacks the political will to meet the growing demand for electricity.the only option left is to privatise the power sector, he added. however, chief minister dhumal countered these views by saying his government was still providing a hidden subsidy of rs 188 crore to hpseb.

8,Terrorism cannot be stopped by laws: NHRC,"new delhi: in an obvious reference to the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), the national human rights commission (nhrc) has said the problem of terrorism ""cannot be solved by enacting laws that do away with the legal safeguards designed to prevent innocent people from being prosecuted and punished."" ""the problem cannot be solved by providing for a different and more drastic procedure for prosecution of certain crimes by making confession to the police admissible in evidence, contrary to provisions in the evidence act, for raising the presumption of guilt as set out in the bill,"" nhrc chairman j s verma said. delivering the keynote address at all india criminology conference here on thursday, he said while tackling terrorism government should adopt strategies which balance the dignity of individuals and national security. ""any law enacted to tackle terrorism must be very closely scrutinised and must muster the strict approval of constitutional validity. legislature must see whether there is at all any need for such a law...,"" he said adding ""new laws will be effective only if supplementing existing laws are not enough."" elaborating on the different facets of modern day crimes such as narco-terrorism, hijacking and cyber crimes, verma said ""it is not deficiency in the law and competence of people that is a hurdle in tackling these problems, it was more due to lack of government's will and awareness of civil society.""

10,"Rectify anomalies in WTO pact, BJP tells govt","amrtisar: in an effort to woo the working class and farmers ahead of the elections to the uttar pradesh and punjab assemblies, the bjp on friday asked the government to expedite the implementation of social safety measures and ensure rectification of anomalies in the wto agreement at the upcoming meet in doha. in his introductory speech at the two-day national executive meeting here, party president jana krishnamurthy said the government should expedite implementation of social safety measures, including extending benefits of insurance coverage to the private sector workers in the same way as to psu workers. he urged the government to enhance compensation to workers affected by downsizing from 15 days to 45 days salary against each year's service besides setting up of a national renewal fund to rehabilitate them. expressing confidence that the government will not allow any new issues for discussion at the doha meeting without first resolving the implemenation programme, he said, ""i earnestly appeal to the government that the anomalies in the present set up, especially the ones that adversely affect our farmers and small sector, should be rectified."" in an apparent reference to the opposition's attack on poto, recently promulgated by the government, krishnamurthy appealed to them not to ""allow party or partisan interests to come in the way of fighting out the challenge posed by the terrorists. in a democracy we can afford to have different views. ""but when time comes when the national security is under threat, all should close ranks and extend unstinted support to all the efforts of the government of the day and no difference should be allowed to come in the way of securing and safeguarding the security of the nation."" charging pakistan president pervez musharraf with adopting double standards, he said ""it is strange that musharraf is trying to doublespeak as and when he brands cross-border terrorism as freedom struggle and on the other admits terrorism in afghanistan. his efforts to take public opinion in the world for a ride may not succeed. terrorism is terrorism, pure and simple."" the bjp chief said if pakistan was sincere and serious in eliminating terrorism, it would do well to stop cross-border terrorism from its soil. ""if president musharraf and pakistan shed their claws of terrorism first then they will find india extending its hand of friendship to them."" expressing concern over the harassment of hindus in bangladesh and the flow of refugees from that country, krishnamurthy urged the new government in dhaka to take necessary steps to check them. with an eye on the rural electorate, krishnamurthy suggested setting up of specialised courts to handle all land disputes, simplifying and improvising ground registration system for land titles, lowering of stamp duty to minimise tax evasion and reduce cost assured possession of dwelling units. he also asked the government to remove hurdles in conversion of the so-called agricultural lands where no cultivation is taking place, as being done in delhi. strongly backing the government's labour reforms programme, he said the proposed amendment to the industrial dispute act and contract laws should be made in such a manner ""that would help in accelerating economic activities through enhanced investment flow,"" besides increasing employment opportunities. he said there was scope for improvement in bridging the communication gap between the government and labour. krishnamurthy also asked the government to consider parity in approach for both lending and borrowing. at the organisational level, the bjp chief called for closer communication between central leaders and grassroot level cadres. ""this will greatly enable to build up the necessary closeness and communication that has been the hallmark of our organisation all through"", he said. he described the akali dal-bjp relationship as quite good. ""with due understanding and accommodation, i am sure, our alliance will accept and meet the electoral challenges successfully,"" he added.

13,Surat gardens turning prohibited zones for law-abiding citizens,"surat: come evening and the air becomes thick in the city's numerous gardens, riversides and stretches of the piplod-dumas road with the sights of fully-engrossed young love-birds, caring a damn for law-abiding citizens. they not only pose as a traffic hazard, by attracting the attention of passers-by, but also mirror the reflections which are often obscene, giving a bad impression to children and senior citizens as well. no wonder, for parul pathak and her husband, residents of rander, it was a shock of life when they took their five-year-old son to a nearby garden one evening. what was intended to be a fun and games-filled evening for them, turned out to be a visit which made them sceptical of going to any garden henceforth. as pathak says, the garden they went to was crowded with young couples in intimate positions, adding that it was difficult to answer the curious queries of the young kid. most families keep away from these gardens as the love-birds are totally indifferent to visitors and are a cause of embarrassment for everyone. according to police sources, even law-enforcing officials keep away from these places. surprisingly, nobody has so far filed a complaint on these activities, though they are heard grumbling on the scenario, a senior police official said. many more rue the fact that surat being an economically well-placed city lacks places of community leisure and amusement like theme gardens or parks and museums. hemlata karnik, a resident of palanpur patia, feels today's youth are more than eager to indulge in such activities rather than taking part in outdoor games and sports. what is more disturbing is their total lack of remorse even if seen by many people, she said. very often groups of women can be seen having a kitty-party on the sardar bridge connecting athwa gate area with adajan. jyoti patel, a housewife, says though their group enjoys outdoor parties, they rule out gardens because of the presence of these 'shameless young couples' as their children also accompany them. both patel and pathak strongly feel it is high time for authorities to sit up and take notice. it is also a common sight in the evenings of families crowding the bridge spanning the tapi. add to it the various vendors selling snacks and balloons with total disregard for vehicular traffic. but the traffic police do not seem to take any action against them. a traffic police official doing his rounds there said they do not initiate any action as it is the only place for an embarrassment-free outing. a garden in adajan, situated off the hazira road, is perhaps a shade different from others. a fairly large number of families are seen enjoying their evenings here as it happens to be well-lit. but just a few metres ahead, where the road slopes down to the river bank, young couples are seen engaged in intimate positions making it unviable for families to take a quite walk in the evenings.

14,More violence at B J; health commissioner holds meeting,"ahmedabad: barely two hours after state health commissioner c i joi left b j medical college on thursday, some hostel students were beaten up by their classmates. they were also threatened with dire consequences right outside dean k v bhatt''s office. joi had a special meeting with the civil hospital authorities to assess the situation after an intern was severely beaten up on tuesday. violence has even prompted state health minister ashok bhatt to institute a committee to weed out violence from medical education in the state. among those present at the meeting were civil hospital superintendent anil chaddha, assistant dean of the college usha shah, deputy director of medical education k k shah and senior professors. no sooner had joi left the campus than some students from the hostel tried to approach usha shah complaining that they were being forced against their will into singing memoranda against the non-gujarati students. they were allegedly stopped right at the entrance by students from the b block and beaten up. the incident has only helped other students unite against those who are known for violence on the campus. even as a large number of police officials were rushed in to quell any further skirmishes, students of a and d block of the hostel gathered on the lawns to show their solidarity with the victims. they said they were risking their lives by coming out in the open like this, but they had reached the limit of their patience. the main culprits, most students allege, come from the b block, considered a stronghold of students from mehsana. hostelites from the other blocks are expected to adhere to their demands, which makes an unbelievable list. if a b block students asked for a student''s motorcycle keys, he is not supposed to question, just hand over the keys. students are also supposed to do their journals fro them, impersonate for them in ward exams, and get beaten up on being seen talking to a certain girl. there have been instances where a top ranking student was slapped by a senior so hard that his ear drum burst, just a day before an important exam. a faculty member allegedly told him he would be operated upon only if he did not complain to the authorities. one student told tnn: ""there is not a single student, especially among the non-gujaratis, who has not been beaten up after getting admission here. and despite all the police protection, there is no guarantee we will not get beaten again. they only have to wait till the police leave."" the junior doctor''s association, however, says non-gujaratis who have relatives in the government at the centre are putting pressure on the authorities to indict b block students. their main concern, especially of the juniors, is that they may not be allowed to pass as many of their exams are taken by the resident doctors, many of whom are involved in the violence.

15,IWAI a party in Ganga drift case: HC,"patna: the patna high court on friday gave a directive for making the inland waterways authority of india (iwai) a party in the public interest litigation (pil) which seeks cleaning of the ganga and steps to check the northward drift of the river away from the city. a division bench comprising justice s k singh and justice s k katriar passed the order for making the iwai a party due to its role in dredging the ganga bed near patna. before passing the order on the writ petition of the convener of the ganga bachao andolan, vikas chandra alias guddu baba, the court took judicial notice of the riverbed rising due to siltation and of the ganga water level along the city going down due to its northward drift. the court also gave a directive for making the patna regional development authority a party in the case due to its role in cleaning patna. the plea of guddu baba was that due to heavy siltation over the years in the riverbed the ganga has started changing its course. he referred to other factors that have given rise to the river drift. the court directed the patna municipal corporation (pmc) and other concerned agencies of the state government to take all steps to clean the river banks before chhath festival. the pmc and the state government have to submit reports to the court about cleaning of the river banks by wednesday. guddu baba showed to the court photographs of the animal carcasses dumped on the river bank polluting the environment. he had earlier shown photographs of the human bodies dumped behind the patna medical college hospital (pmch). despite court's directive, he said, the dumping of bodies on the river bank has not stopped. he argued that the river bank was to be maintained by the pmc but that is not being done. the secretary of the council for protection of public rights and welfare, m p gupta, a lawyer, submitted that due to the neglect of the pmc the banks of the river have become dirty and so unfit for chhath puja. as regards the cleaning of the pmch campus, a member of the three-lawyer committee had earlier reported to the court that there was an agreement between the pmch and the pmc that the latter would clean the pmch campus on payment. but on friday the pmc lawyer stated that there is no such agreement. the pmc lawyer contended that the pmch owes rs 55 lakh to the pmc by way of holding tax for the last several years. it's a sheer clash between two government agencies -- pmc and pmch -- over the cleaning of the latter's premises, quipped gupta.

16,Earth sciences: Philosophy of sustainable development,"lucknow: environment problems caused by ill-planned exploitation of natural resources and in the name of development activities; the understanding of the relationship between earth sciences and societal issues; and the replacement of `philosophy of growth' with that of the `philosophy of sustainable development' formed the crux of the talks delivered at the symposium on `role of earth sciences in integrated development and related societal issues'. the symposium organised on friday by the geological survey of india, northern region, on the occasion of its sesquicentennial celebrations had the chief guest union minister for coal and mines ram vilas paswan emphasising on the need for further strengthening the gsi. delivering the inaugural address, paswan decried the reduction in the gsi's field of work by the creation of other departments and stressed on the need for a more holistic approach to the field of earth sciences. the minister said talent was not lacking in the country, but knowledge had to be spread and new ideas created. he regretted that scientists who took training in the country opted for greener pastures abroad and lamented that despite an abundance of everything, countries like china and australia were way ahead of india. paswan also called for investment of foreign money and creation of a level playing field to attract investors. he said an investors meet had been convened by him in delhi in this connection. referring to such symposiums, the minister said the extracts of such deliberations would be discussed at a national level symposium to be held sometime in delhi. earlier, director general, gsi, ravi shankar said man had evolved through the ages and with it his requirements for comfortable living had also grown by leaps and bounds. hence, it was important to reassess the relationship between the earth sciences and societal issues. he said for many decades mineral exploitation had taken place, putting environmental concerns in the backseat. likewise, population explosion had also put a tremendous pressure on the exploitation of non-renewable and renewable earth resources. the dg said that while loss of forest and top soil were reversible processes, loss of land forms due to construction of large dams and man-made reservoirs took millions of years to regain equilibrium with natural forces. hence, it was important to address the critical issue of how much was too much and it was the earth scientists who could determine when and where the line was to be drawn.

17,Mamata wants all-party meet on terror ordinance,"kolkata: trinamul congress supremo mamata banerjee has demanded an all-party meeting on the proposed state ordinance to contain organised crime (poco). speaking to newsmen in kolkata on thursday, banerjee, however, has given a rider for the trinamul's inclusion in the all-party meeting. ""it is necessary to call an all-party meeting on poco for the sake of democracy. but trinamul will attend the meeting only if it is held at a venue outside the writers' buildings,"" banerjee said. she, however, said that the opposition must be allowed to put forward its point of view during the all-party meeting. ""it is no point calling an all party meeting if you have already taken a decision on some matter. this had happened during the all-party meeting on midnapore's division,"" banerjee pointed out. when her attention was drawn to the fact that the state government was now keen to introduce the controversial law as a bill in the next session of the assembly, rather than promulgate an ordinance, mamata banerjee said that her party will oppose it with all its might on the floor of the house. ""i hope left front partners will also not support if the bill is introduced in the assembly,"" she said. commenting on the central ordinance to combat terrorism, mamata banerjee said that it was she who had opposed the tada. ""i even boycotted the parliament and stayed away from it for six months,"" she said. the trinamul supremo, however, hastened to add that tough situations demanded tough regulations. ""i have not yet received the drafts of either the central or the state ordinance. we have to go through them properly before airing our point of view,"" mamata banerjee said. she also felt that the government of buddhadeb bhattacharjee was trying to introduce the draconian ordinance in order to stifle political opposition in the state.

18,'Tie-up with any party for poll only on a common agenda',"lucknow: president of the lok janshakti party and union minister for coal and mines ram vilas paswan on friday said an alliance between his and any other political party for the forthcoming vidhan sabha elections would be on the basis of a common agenda. he refused to comment on how many seats his party would be contesting in view of bjp's stipulation that it would not give more than 50-55 seats to its allies in uttar pradesh. addressing a press conference, paswan, whose party is a constituent of the ruling nda at the centre and who is now making forays in up politics, said seat distribution was an internal matter of the nda, to be decided amongst the constituents. however, the agenda would have to be common for all and exclude the three contentious issues-- common civil code, the ayodhya imbroglio and article 370 of the constitution. paswan, who projects himself as the `messiah' of the dalits and is a contender for the vote bank of bsp leader mayawati, brushed aside the bsp leader's observation that he had no locus standi in up by stating that she was suffering from an inferiority complex. ""people who do not contest elections on the basis of issues but practise politics in the name of religion and caste make such comments,"" he averred. he simultaneously stressed that his kind of politics was above caste or creed and concentrated on three major issues-- right to work, right to education and right to health. refusing to comment on the stay granted by the supreme court on the reservation within reservation ordinance promulgated by the rajnath singh government and whether singh's electoral ploy had now come unstuck, the lokshakti leader said it was the intention behind the move which actually mattered.
