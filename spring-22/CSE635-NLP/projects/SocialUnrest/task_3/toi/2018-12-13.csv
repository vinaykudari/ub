2,Cong abstains from meet on Assembly rules,"hyderabad: the new set of rules for conducting the proceedings of the state legislative assembly are not likely to be implemented till the budget session as the major opposition party congress chose to keep away from the meeting of floor leaders convened by the speaker k pratibha bharathi. the government, based on a report by the assembly sub-committee, had decided to modify the procedures on the lines of parliament. the speaker, leaders of the bjp, the cpm and the government whips were taken aback by the unannounced absence of the congress party.the chief whip of tdp, k venkat rao, said that the congress legislature party (clp) leader y s rajashekar reddy had been informed about the meeting. ""we do not know why he did not attend,"" he said. according to the bjp floor leader n indrasena reddy, the bjp and leftist parties had expressed their agreement to modify the procedures, particularly those regarding the tabling of questions and raising of issues under rule 304. during the 11-day session scheduled to begin from december 19, the house has to reply to about 100 questions. under the present system the questions left unanswered in the last session too are taken-up again. this, the bjp and leftists said, was not necessary as they would have lost relevance due to the delay. if the system was modified, the members would raise questions of immediate interest and would become more active in participating in the proceedings of the house. similarly, the number of issues to be raised under rule 304 is also sought to be restricted and the speaker could use her powers to reject old issues. anything that had transpired between the last day of the last session and the new session only should be allowed to be discussed under the rule.according to the leaders, this would enable better time management.

""any changes in the reservations requires an amendment to the act, which only the assembly or parliament can do,"" he said. the bjp leaders have pointed out to the mch officials that 2,830 residents of manikeshwari nagar were included in the mch voters list and requested for deletion of their names as they belonged to uppal municipality. however, the mch officials have rejected the suggestion as they said that while conducting elections, the entire corporation would be taken as single unit as per the rules.

7,How the helmet rule crumbled,"pune: the second attempt in 10 years by the state government to make the use of helmets compulsory for two-wheeler riders in the city has ended in a major fiasco marked by poor planning and co-ordination between government departments and political opportunism. the fact that the civic polls are just round the corner sucked the political parties into the issue once they sensed that unless they were seen opposing the helmet rule, their prospects in the civic polls may be adversely affected. the government, on its part, not only failed to ban the sale of substandard, non-isi helmets, but also failed to ensure that isi helmets were available in large numbers without citizens having to pay exorbitant premiums. setting an unfortunate example for the citizens was the traffic police department which failed to apply the government directive to its own personnel on two-wheelers. well after december 1, when the mandatory rule for helmets came into force in pune city, a number of traffic policemen were seen riding motorcycles or scooters without helmets. while the regional transport office said that it did not have sufficient manpower to enforce the compulsion on helmets, the rto and the traffic police seemed to be unsure about the precise schedule for ""educating"" people on the merits of helmets or on the fine amount and the date from which the fine of rs 100 was to be levied on offenders. things changed drastically on december 5 when the bombay high court came down heavily on the enforcing authorities for being too lenient. stung by the criticism, the police fined approximately 6,000 people for not wearing helmets on december 6 alone, while the corresponding figure between december 1 to 4 was approximately 1,500. with that came the surge of people who, now convinced that there was no excuse for not buying one, thronged helmet shops resulting in an acute shortage of helmets. adding to the confusion was deputy chief minister and home minister chhagan bhujbal's statement in pune on december 30 that in view of the opposition to the helmets directive, the government may ""reconsider"" the issue. although the government directive making helmets compulsory was issued on october 1, at no stage did it seem as though the government was keen or firm on implementing the decision. in fact, the government's gr seemed like a knee-jerk reaction to the public interest litigation filed by the students of symbiosis law college. interestingly, the symbiosis students were not the first to demand that helmets be made compulsory to help reduce the number of serious injuries resulting from road accidents. last year, a special task force constituted by the state government under former union minister mohan dharia had recommended in its report that helmets be made compulsory all over the state. although the report was submitted in november last, the government did not act on its recommendations despite the fact that all formalities including inviting people's objections and suggestions were completed by april this year. dr vidya yeravdekar, director, symbiosis centre for health care, and one of the petitioners in the helmets case in the bombay high court felt that the authorities should have educated people about helmets during the two months before implementation started. ""the common people were confused. they were getting wrong signals about the implementation and did not take the rule seriously. this was the time when the authorities should have prepared them and educated them about the merits of using helmets,"" she remarked. dr yeravdekar said that even if 80 per cent of people used helmets, ""it would amount to saving many lives and people would realise their utility"".

8,Everything you wanted to know about the civic polls,"pune: with a whopping 78 per cent of those surveyed under the times poll professing ignorance about the new voting system, pmc election officer rajendra nimbalkar admitted the need to educate voters about the new system and asserted that the pmc had chalked out a programme for the same. it will publish advertisements and articles in the newspapers in january, after the process of filing the nominations for the elections completes on january 10 and tie up with the local cable television networks so that capsules on how to vote in a panel system can be screened during the first week of february. the election office will also be conducting meetings with political parties to seek their support in popularising the panel system. in the meantime, here is a ready reckoner to the new panel system what is the difference between the old system and the new one? the only difference is that the voter is required to stamp three ballot papers and thus elect three corporators. hitherto, a voter was empowered to elect just one corporator from the municipal ward to which he belonged. under the panel system, the voter will be empowered to cast votes for candidates contesting the municipal elections from the two neighbouring municipal wards included in the panel. why is it called the panel system? the 146 municipal wards have been grouped in 48 panels. barring the exception of two panels, all the remaining 46 panels comprise three wards each - ward a, ward b and ward c. what is the procedure on voting day? under the system, voters will be given three separate ballot papers, for wards a, b and c in the panel and will be expected to cast their vote not just for the candidates contesting the elections from ward a, but also for ward b and ward c. to avoid confusion about the names of the candidates and the areas they are contesting from, the pmc will issue different coloured ballot papers. so, the ward a ballot paper will be white in colour, ward b ballot in blue and ward c, pink in colour. can a candidate contest from more than one ward in a panel? no, the panel system does not allow a candidate to contest the election from more then one ward in a panel. thus, the name of a candidates contesting from ward a will not be repeated in the other wards under the panel. how is this system better that the earlier one? those in support of the panel system say that this system will empower the voter and help keep the slum lords and criminal elements out of power. hitherto, slumlords and people with criminal background have succeeded in civic polls by nurturing a slum pocket and getting elected to the pmc, year after year. under the panel system, however, people not residing in slums will have an opportunity to bring in a change. the chances of criminals getting elected to the pmc from a slum-dominated ward will be marginalised if a larger voter base has to decide the candidate's fate. any other facts voters should know? the success of the panel system depends on a high voter turnout. in previous civic elections, while voting from slum areas has been 90 per cent that from other areas has been just 60 per cent.

12,A Bangalore model for Delhi’s development,"new delhi: how long does it take to acquire a full title deed of a property through dda? fifteen years, say officials. in banglore one gets it in just a week. how much time does one waste acquiring land? six years according to dda officials. in banglore itâ€™s possible in just 90 days. now, urban development minister ananth kumar has finally given the go-ahead to a proposal, which has been under consideration for long, to restructure dda. â€˜â€˜the government had considered restructuring and reorganisation of dda through modernization and rationalisation in different spheres of its activities so that it becomes more result-oriented,â€™â€™ kumar recently said in parliament. and the model which dda has to emulate is that of the banglore development authority, kumarâ€™s own hometown and constitutency. the minister said a review committee had been formed to look into the â€˜â€˜specific details about reorganization planning and it would submit a report within a week.â€™â€™ but what is this bangalore model â€” which was also bracketed in the same infamous category as dda till four years ago? according to a senior dda official â€˜â€˜the legal provisions and the matters related to staff operations have been streamlined and the working atmosphere has been made more professional,â€™â€™ the official said, adding that the bda has made the staff more accountable to the people. bda had tapped resources even from the lower category personnel, be it a peon. â€˜â€˜he/she has been empowered with an assignment as an in-charge of some special project, in a way making them feel more responsive. the organisation had not sacked anybody but infused more confidence into them, something lacking to some extent with the dda,â€™â€™ the official said. the banglore model also constituted an agenda task force which has members from all streams, including top software professionals. the task force is committed to the people and in â€˜â€˜actual transparent modeâ€™â€™ has to tell the residents what they intend to do and how much time it would take and the cost and other factors. â€˜â€˜the residents are taken into confidence before executing any major development project,â€™â€™ the dda official said, adding that the department head has to give an explanation for not completing any work within the stipulated time. kumar, who has been holding regular meetings with higher officials on the issue, recently said dda has already started the action plan and several short-term and long-term measures have been initiated to rationalise its workforce, introduce computerisation and e-governance, making it more responsive to the public.

13,Laloo demands dismissal of NDA govt,"ranchi: rjd president laloo prasad yadav on wednesday demanded dismissal of the nda government at the centre in the wake of the coffin scam. talking to newsmen at the birsa airport here before leaving for patna, he said those involved in the scam should be incarcerated for life. stating that fernandes was not the ""lone player"", he remarked: ""the entire atal bihari vajpayee government should resign owning moral responsibility"". laloo said it was an irony that those who exposed scams were incarcerated and those involved in it moved scot-free. he demanded a high-level inquiry into the scam. laloo said the 'involvement' of nda ministers in the 'murky' arms deal and now the coffin scam had adversely affected the morale of the armed forces. reacting on fernandes talking about the comptroller and auditor general's reports and instituting inquiries, he said he too had instituted such inquiries in the fodder scam but was forced to step down and implicated on the basis of 'fabricated' charges. ""nothing could have been worse than cheating the nation in the name of those who had laid down their lives for the country, he added. on the coming uttar pradesh polls, he said his party had an alliance with the congress and efforts were on to align with other like-minded forces. calling jharkhand chief minister babulal marandi ""a small fry"", he said, ""efforts are on to switch off the remote through which the government is being run from the centre,"" he added. bail extended: the patna high court on wednesday exempted the rjd president from personal appearance in the disproportionate assets case and extended his provisional bail by three months till march 6, 2002. justice shashank kumar singh passed the order after hearing arguments of laloo's counsel c r sinha and cbi advocate rakesh kumar. laloo's counsel prayed for granting his client a regular bail in the case and pleaded for his exemption from personal appearance.

14,UP minister sacked for criminal links,"lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh on wednesday sacked minister of state for institutional finance amarmani tripathi for allegedly harbouring criminals. the move came after the special task force of the state police arrested a gang of five kidnappers from a house in the cantonment area on tuesday night. the five, who had kidnapped the son of a businessman from basti on december 5, told the police that the minister had arranged for their stay in the house. the police also freed the businessman's son. the house belongs to rajesh agarwal, who was shot dead a year back. his brother, manoj, said he had allowed the kidnappers to stay in the bungalow at the ""behest of the minister"". chief minister told reporters that on coming to know about tripathi's role in the matter, he decided to sack him and sought the governor's approval for the same. on the other hand, tripathi, who is in gorakhpur, denied the charge and said he did not know why he was being dropped. amarmani belongs to the loktantrik congress party and is said to have been lately ""hobnobbing with the congress"". he was reported to be one of the 12 ministers named in an stf report for patronising contract killed shri prakash shukla. there are 33 criminal cases lodged against him, including that of murder, kidnapping and extortion. justifying his decision, the chief minister said, ""we had information about the criminal antecedents of amarmani. but we were waiting for documentary proof."" he said his government would not spare anyone with criminal links. amarmani is the third minister to be dropped by rajnath. earlier, naresh agarwal and ashok yadav were dropped from the cabinet, ostensibly for violating the spirit of collective responsibility.

15,Follow ICMR rules for trials: Thakur,"new delhi: any violation of the indian council of medical research's guidelines on biomedical research would invite a ban on further research by the concerned institutions and scientists, union minister for health and family welfare c p thakur said on wednesday. he reiterated that the government had already ordered suspension of all human trials at the regional cancer centre (rcc), thiruvananthapuram. the centre was found testing a banned drug in violation of the regulatory procedures for undertaking clinical trials for drugs. a central team that investigated the trials at the rcc in a report to the union health ministry recently said the centre failed to obtain permission from the drug controller of india. it also required a clearance from the ministry's screening committee for projects to be undertaken in collaboration with a foreign agency. the rcc collaborated with the johns hopkins institute in the us for conducting the trials. thakur said the decision would send strong signals to research communities, both within as well as outside the country, that indians can not be treated as guinea pigs in a zeal to invent new things. ""while we encourage wholesome biomedical research, the government would not tolerate violation of basic ethics and human rights"", he said. the scientists involved in testing the drugs at the rcc would also be censured, he added. the rcc recently conducted trials with an anti-cancer drug, 'm4n', during november 1999 to april 2,000 on 25 patients suffering from oral cancer.

16,Legal battles divide Laloo and politics,"patna: whatever verdict the supreme court may give on rashtriya janata dal (rjd) chief laloo yadav's bail plea, the national democratic alliance (nda) leaders appear confident that the ""lion coming to jharkhand"" has been cornered. ""it's not laloo staying in jail or being released that concerns us. he will be busy fighting court cases in patna, ranchi and dumka for the next five years,"" said a union minister, while speaking to a group of journalists at a recent social gathering. the rjd chief is already facing five fodder scam related cases, and with two more cases in the pipeline, his hands are full with legal battles. worse ^ five of the seven cases are to be heard in jharkhand. ""that should keep him tied up in jharkhand for at least 10 days a month,"" said a lawyer. weariness is already gripping the rjd camp. the ""second coming"" of the rjd chief to ranchi was marked by the absence of crowds and bravado, which dominated his road show on november 25. it was a visibly weary laloo, who alleged that the cases had been deliberately timed to keep him out of the coming uttar pradesh assembly polls. no wonder his well-wishers like former prime ministers v p singh and chandra shekhar wish laloo a quick ""jayalalitha-type"" verdict. the threat of laloo being too occupied with legal battles is being felt within the party. the rjd's national executive meet in patna last october passed a resolution charging the centre with curbing the political activities of laloo by getting numerous cases registered against him. the rjd office-bearers hailing from outside bihar complained that laloo had become inaccessible for them and that whenever they tried to talk to him on telephone, they learnt that he was busy in court. the effect of court cases on his political activities is also being felt in bihar. recently, jammu and kashmir chief minister farooq abdullah wanted to meet laloo. but when he arrived at laloo's residence, he was told that laloo had already taken the flight for ranchi, where he was to be produced before the special court the following day.

""rabri devi has failed to check the shooting crime graph; she should hand over the home portfolio to a minister who is capable of checking growing incidents of murder, loot and kidnapping for ransom"", tekriwal told reporters. tekriwal, who had resigned from the rabri ministry last year accusing her of being abject failure in checking crime, said the home department was totally paralysed under the chief minister and suggested her to handover the portfolio to a senior colleague like water resources minister jagdanand singh or law minister shakeel ahmed khan or public health engineering department minister rama devi. the rjd leader said the government had decided to install mobile phone jammers at the beur model jail to frustrate attempts by imprisoned criminals to demand extortion by phone but that was not done. he charged that the jammers were not being installed as rjd president laloo prasad yadav was frequently lodged in beur prison in connection with the fodder scam and he would find it difficult to keep in touch with senior ministers and officials if the apparatus was installed.

18,Congress may not relent on terror law,"new delhi: if the nda government uses the attack on parliament house to whip up emotions and build a campaign in favour of the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), the congress has decided to counter it on the gounds that poto has been in force for the last seven weeks but failed to prevent the incident. ""let people not be deluded ... this incident took place inspite of poto, not for want of it,"" congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy said after the congress working committee (cwc) held an emergency meeting on thursday evening to take stock of the day's developments. the congress is unlikely to dilute its opposition to poto, reddy stated adding that the attack should not be linked to the general discussion on poto. ""poto has been in operation for seven weeks... this incident demonstrates the inefficacy of poto as a piece of legislation,"" said reddy, adding that what the government needs to do is to tone up its intelligence and enforcement machinery. stating that their position on poto will not change, congress leaders maintained that if the nda government tries to politcise the issue, the opposition will not lag behind. ""we too will do the same... we will expose the collosal intelligence failure and the massive security lapse which led to this incident,"" said a senior congress leader, adding that this is exactly what had happened in kargil. ""we cannot allow the government to bungle all the time and then expect our cooperation,"" added another leader. this was also reflected in the cwc's official statement which pointed out that the incident had brought out the ""monumental intelligence failure"" on part of the government, particularly since it had previous information about a possible terrorist attack on parliament. no preventive steps were taken inspite of the fact that the government had been warned about such an attack, reddy said. while expressing its shock at the ""dastardly attack by terrorists on parliament house in broad daylight,"" the cwc did not let the government off the hook, stating that it was the government`s responsibility to safeguard the country's security. congress sources said most members expressed outrage at the government's handling of internal security. ""why was not a single new measure taken to improve security in and around parliament since the home minister had intelligence reports about such an attack,"" said another congress leader.

25,CM wants people to accept `user pays' principle,"bangalore: chief minister s m krishna on thursday emphasised the need for people to supplement government's efforts in the developmental activities by adopting the ""user charges principle"" - a concept where people should be willing to pay for the facility they avail from the government. releasing the book titled refashioning the new economic order: karnataka in transition written by arun p. bali of delhi-based indian council of social science research (icssr) here, krishna said, karnataka was always in the forefront to contribute `meaningfully and substantially' to the new economic order which is being attempted to in the country. ``karnataka rulers __be it before independence or after __had a visionary zeal and liberal attitude who initiated reforms in various sectors even before it was thought at centre,'' he added. he recalled his days as industries minister when the uk-based gillette company refused to enter into a joint venture with the government. the situation has undergone a sea change following the liberalisation initiated by the then finance minister manmohan singh during early 1990s. according to krishna, the role and functioning of the state has come to be redefined in the dynamics of economics in the fast-changing global scenario. planning will also become increasingly focussed and indicative on the needs of the diversified sections of the society. ``it is in this backdrop the role of the institutes like icssr becomes significant,'' he added. explaining the reform-oriented measures initiated by his government, krishna said he was facing the biggest challenge of reforming the power sector which is delicate but inevitable task. describing the medium term fiscal plan (mtfp) announced by his government as a significant step to initiate restructuring state's finances, krishna said efforts are being taken to end regional and social disparity to ensure wholesome development of the state. the book edited by arun p. bali has 17 chapters which deals with the all round development of the state under the stewardship of krishna. later speaking to reporters, krishna said the first, but important step in reforming power sector, was the proposal for universal metering to assess the extent of transmission and distribution (t&d) loss. he said it is a world-bank aided project to ensure that accountability is established for the power consumed by different sections of the society. ``the extent of t & d loss is estimated to be around 36 per cent but it is yet to be correctly assessed,'' he added. asked about the opposition to the proposal by the farmers, krishna said the government is confident of convincing them. ``this is where the user-charger principle comes into picture. our farmers are self-respecting people. they do not want anything free of cost. it is we politicians who have poisoned their mind over a period of time,'' he added.
