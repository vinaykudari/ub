''by spending lakhs on marriage arrangements, and illogical purchase of costly tractors without considering the diminishing returns to agriculture, the farmers in the state have pushed themselves into a vicious debt trap' gautam told media persons here on sunday. in an oblique manner, the bjp leader held the orissa government itself responsible for starvation deaths due to its dysfunctional public distribution system. he said at a time when food grains stocks were spilling over starvation deaths were an ugly blot on the country, he said. he said the negligent attitude of some state governments towards the maintenance of the public distribution system had resulted in a food shortage. blaming the parties inability to fulfil some promises made in the party manifesto on its allies because of which it had to proceed under a common minimum programme, he said once the bjp came to power with a full majority it would fulfil all its promises. gautam was here to preside over a shakti pardarshan rally being organised by other backward classes welfare association punjab. he said the bjp was the saviour of sc/sts and obcs as it was the bjp which raised the demand of reservation for obcs during the janta party government in the centre. he said the party would celebrate the golden jubilee of its formation and entering the political arena on october 23 at a nationallevel conference at agra from 13-14 october. he said given the decline of the janata dal and communist parties the congress and bjp were the only mainstream parties left.

2,Punjab farmers have other fish to fry,"pathankot: agriculturalists of the state are now turning towards a different type of farming. popularly known as the ''blue revolution'',more and more farmers are taking to fish farming. agricultural inputs required for traditional farming are expensive and most farmers can ill afford them. farmers have tried it all, from crop rotation to taking loans from the government. the result has always been that the debt-ridden farmers, turn up against a wall. pisciculture has provided these ''weary'' farmers the much needed respite.to start with, only a basic infrastructure is required.throw together a fish-pond, fish-feed, spawn, among other things, and one is on the road to becoming a fish farmer. according to gurdaspur assistant director of fisheries karamjit singh, ''the eating habits of rural and urban punjabis have changed.there is an increasing demand for fish.and the area under fish-farming has increased from 240 hectares to 300 hectares. more than 400 small and marginal farmers are rearing fish''. karamjit singh said that the chhamb area was becoming a hot-spot as far as pisciculture was concerned. ''if contracts for fishing in the ranjit sagar dam were given out, the government could earn a lot of money. but the dam administration has ruled this out due to security reasons,'' he added. fish-farmers were earlier looked down upon. now with fish-farmers earning at least rs 40,000 a year, things are changing. surata singh of khan mallak village is happy. ''i started fish-farming four years ago.the bank had loaned rs 1 lakh to me. i had started with one acre of land, now my farm has expanded to 2.75 acres. i sell fish for rs 30 a kg to a middleman. i have repaid my loan and will be able to construct a pucca house for my family. i had given poultry farming a shot, but had failed.this is comparatively inexpensive,'' surata said. sube singh of sangar village said, ''i do not face the threat of floods anymore. the earth that was dug up from my fish-pond was spread out, thereby raising the level of the land. besides, i earn at least rs 50,000 a year.'' sube singh now owns the ''biggest marriage palace'' of the district. he attributes his success to pisciculture.''now i own a tractor and a car,'' he said. similarly, 26-year-old harpinder singh of zaffarwal village has added two more acres to his fish-farm, ''because the earnings were so good''. parminder pal singh of machchanian village used land, which was used for a brick-kiln to his advantage. his farm is spread over 3.75 acres and according to him,''fish-farming is very profitable''. parminder pal, who also heads the 11-member fish-farmers marketing group said, ''if we could get hold of a machine for making instant fish-fillets, business would increase manifold. then we could target the hotel market''. parminder has returned after attending a tenday training programme at the central in-land fresh water aqua culture institute in orissa, under the agriculture training management

3,Stay on school panels leaves govt in limbo,"bangalore: the state government is yet to decide on its future course of action in wake of the court's directive to stay the circular on constitution of school development monitoring committees (sdmcs). the sdmcs had been mooted for the cause of primary education and entrusting a sense of community ownership of schools. bowing under political pressure, however, the government changed the way the sdmcs are constituted by allowing mlas to nominate nine parent representatives and also the president. the original idea was to allow the parents to choose nine representatives and the president. the circular regarding constitution of sdmcs was challenged by a parent in court last month following which the circular was stayed. the decision to allow mlas to nominate parents to the sdmcs was seen as a move defeating the very purpose of the constitution of sdmcs and also the objective of community ownership of schools. ``we are yet to get a copy of the court order and the petition. after studying them, we will take a suitable decision,'' t.m. vijayabhaskar, commissioner of public instruction, told this paper. he clarified that the sdmcs are continuing to function and have held several meetings so far. ``since the court order has only stayed the circular on their constitution, the sdmcs can function based on the earlier circular. schools which haven't formed sdmcs already, can constitute the committees based on the first circular,'' vijayabhaskar said. the government decided to form sdmcs as per the recommendations made by the task force on education, headed by scientist raja ramanna. a special order was issued on april 28, 2001, to form the sdmcs in place of school betterment committees and village education committees. besides monitoring regular activities of the school and performance of students, the sdmcs have the power to report to higher officers to initiate action against teachers for dereliction of duties after a discussion at the monthly meetings. allowing mlas to nominate parents was seen as a step to curb the powers given to them by the government. besides the nine parent representatives, the sdmcs will have members of the gram panchayat, taluk panchayat and zilla panchayat of that locality, anganwadi teacher of the village, health worker of that area and head master of the school. those who have adopted the school and donated land for the building are nominated members. also, an educationist or retired teacher of the area is nominated to the sdmcs.

4,MCC strikes: Marandi govt on the defensive,"ranchi: if the recent exhibition of firearms recovered from naxalites close on the heels of the surrender of more than a dozen extremists before the chief minister recently is any indication, the babulal marandi government — which never tires of flaunting its achievements in containing extremism — now appears to be on the defensive, specially in view of the recent spate of killings by the mcc in the state. the marandi government claims have not gone down well either with the people or the opposition. facts and figures available also tell a different story. while the opposition has already cried foul over the surrender of so-called hardcore mcc extremists in giridih describing it as stage-managed, marandi, however, prefers to attribute the recent spurt in extremist activities to the frustration in the mcc cadre, which is making them hit back with a vengeance. referring to the guerrilla tactics adopted by the extremists during the past few months marandi assured that his government would give a befitting reply to their challenge. the dgp, t p sinha, who has always refrained from revealing any strategy of the government to the media, said that he would soon be in possession of a book called mowmow, which was basically about anti-guerrilla tactics and would perhaps come in handy for the jharkhand police. sinha also did not agree with the theory that the surrenders were an eyewash. some of them were actually hardcore extremists, he stressed. according to the figures available with the times of india though the number of incidents of extremist related activities had come down to 64 this year as compared to 175 in 2000 and 213 in 1999, the number of policemen and others killed has registered a phenomenal increase from 39 and 29 in 1999 and 2000 to 78 up to august 15 this year. as such there could be a ring of truth in marandi's assertion of a decrease in extremist activities. however, losing more than 20 police personnel, including crpf men, in just eight months is obviously not something one can be proud of. sinha, however, points out that this was a war with extremism and in a war there are bound to be reverses. ask policemen about these inevitable reverses and they spit fire and brimstone. we are being sacrificed at the political altar and our lives have become cheap, they rue, frustrated with the lack of equipment and firearms. but sinha is not ready to believe this. even in the last incident in churchu in hazaribagh district in which 11 policemen were killed in a landmine blast an injured constable was ready to go back to the field with a fractured arm and several other injuries. the morale of our boys is far from being low, sinha asserted while admitting that the police have suffered often because of over-confidence and lack of foresight. tusday's display of firearms recovered by the police from mcc bunkers and raids in the last one year included a few police arms, other weapons including slrs, 303s, live cartridges, detonators etc. and some rusty firearms recovered form the bunkers. interestingly enough, the police recently recovered rs 19.60 lakh from raids in mcc hideouts in palamu recently as well as jewellery worth rs 1.17 lakh. moreover, the police have also documentary evidence of these groups having invested in real estate outside the state. the money is siphoned off from the cadre in the name of providing relief for cyclone or earthquake victims and is actually invested elsewhere, sinha said. with the jharkhand government now armed with a rs 20,000-crore, 10-year modernisation plan, it now remains to be seen whether it was lack of political will or constraints which helped the menace to grow in the state over the years.

5,New policy to provide houses for disabled: CM,"bangalore: chief minister s.m. krishna announced a new policy to provide sites and houses to disabled persons at the krishna jayanthi celebrations of the karnataka yadava sangha on sunday. addressing the gathering, krishna said a fresh census had to be made of the disabled in the state, who are presently estimated to be about 3.57 lakh. ``we have to provide them with the eyes, ears and limbs that are missing. if these people have not already been accommodated under the ashraya, indira gandhi and ambedkar housing schemes, they will be given sites and houses under this new policy,'' he stated. krishna said the congress government had always kept the welfare of the backward classes and minorities in mind while drawing up programmes. ``we have already built 3.5 lakh houses in the last two years and will build 7.5 lakh houses over the next three years of our term. the houses for the disabled will be in addition to this,'' he clarified. the cm also announced that the revenue department would be directed to relax the rules that defined revenue villages. ``presently, there have to be 500 houses of the same backward community in one area for it to be declared a revenue village. in cases like the gollas, nayaks, kurubas, bovis and lambanis, such a concentration is difficult, so we are aiming to relax the specification of 500 houses and ensure that these communities can also have revenue villages,'' he added.

7,24-hour govt service takes it easy on Sundays,"hyderabad: despite being touted as a round-the-clock service provider, the staff at the customer care centre (ccc) of the central power distribution company limited (cpdcl) at greenlands are not taking up any work on sundays. the ccc, set up with an estimated cost of rs 80 lakh, is supposed to work round-the-clock, seven-daysa-week, 365-days-a-year. but within 17 days of its inaugural, the ccc staff are refusing to accept complaints from the consumers on sundays and other government holidays. although, the ccc has a staff strength of 24, only two persons were present at its premises in greenlands on sunday afternoon to attend to the customers.a number of people were turned away and were asked by the staff to come on weekdays. one such complainant, k s adhikari of banjara hills, said: i came to lodge a complaint with regard to a billing problem as sunday suits my busy schedule. if they turn away people on holidays, the ccc serves no purpose, he said. even on normal working days, the ccc at greenlands is not attracting much crowds. since its inaugural on september 21, the operational and maintenance complaints (omc) section received 105 complaints till september 30. the complaints related to voltage fluctuations, service wire damage and street light problems, and out of them, only 82 were rectified while the rest of them are pending. the omc section received four complaints on october 1, out of which three were rectified. on october 3, the omc received three complaints and all of them are pending. one complaint was received on october 4, which was attended to, while no complaints were received on october 5. on october 6, there were six complaints, and they are yet to be attended to by the cpdcl staff. the condition of the other two sections on billing and meter problems are no better.the meter problem section has so far received 49 complaints, but only four or five complaints were rectified and the rest are still pending. the section received seven complaints from october 1 to 6, out of which not a single problem was rectified.

8,Idol-snatchers happy to be arrested,"guntur: for once, two burglars were extremely relieved on being arrested. the duo, who stole three panchaloha idols valued at rs 2 lakh from epuru rama temple in epuru village in 1998, were arrested by the police when they were on their way to the temple to restore the idols to their rightful place. the reason for their change of heart was not difficult to understand for the police. misfortune and death had stalked the burglars ever since they stole the idols. while three persons associated with them died one after another, the fourth lost all his wealth while a fifth lost his job. according to the police, e venkateswarlu and s srinivasa rao of gurajala mondal broke into the rama temple in epuru on december 18, 1998 and decamped with three panchaloha idols (each weighing 5 kg) of rama, sita and lakshmana. the duo first took the idols to nadendla village and requested a resident to determine their value. from here, the burglars went to giddalur in prakasam district and deposited the idols with an affluent bus operator and requested him to help them sell the idols. but misfortune struck the bus operator soon after and he lost the three buses in accidents and had to sell his land to keep himself afloat, after which he asked the thieves to take the idols away.the idols were then taken to a clerk in a public sector undertaking in bangalore, who lost his job soon after the idols found their way into his house. when the duo finally reached ganapavaram, the native village of one of the two, nagaraju, an associate who helped them in the burglary, died of a heart attack. frightened by the chain of events, the thieves decided to get rid of the idols by returning them to the temple. they boarded a bus for guntur when a police party headed by inspector chalapati rao, on a routine search, checked their luggage and seized the idols.

9,Housing society rules flouted to get sites,"hyderabad: it not just in the venkateswara cooperative housing society, in which the assembly staff managed to become members and obtained prime government land at throughway prices. independent enquiries by the times of india revealed that at least seven assembly staffers secured house sites in vijaya cooperative housing society, which was awarded government land at banjara hills to develop a residential colony.the government reportedly ordered an enquiry into the issue. interestingly, both the societies were formed with the main objective of providing residential land to the members of the legislative assembly and the bylaws of the societies were changed subsequently to accommodate non-mlas also. taking advantage of the changed rules, besides narayana rao, against whom the anti-corruption bureau (acb) recently registered a disproportionate assets case, a number of assembly staffers also became members of the venkateswara society and secured the prime land. the acb has also began focussing its attention on the methods employed by rao and a few others in securing housing sites at venkateswara society, located at road no 12 in banjara hills.the society allocated 300 sq yards of land to rao, but during a raid last week, the acb detected that he was in possession of over 3,000 sq yards land in the area. the acb officials, prima facie, found that narayana rao, using his proximity to the powers that be, managed to secure a number of house sites in the society by fabricating the documents on the names of a few mlas, who chose not to apply for a land in the society.he seems to have selectively applied for land in the names of those mlas, who have not applied for house site, andafter securing the land, he created false documents claiming that such mlas sold it to him, an acb official investigating the case said. the issue of a few assembly staff managing to secure housing sites in prime banjara hills locality became a quite heartburn for several other government employees working in secretariat and other offices.

10,Parents veto govt's school fee plan,"pune: parents whose children study in government-aided english medium schools in the city have decided to oppose the state government's decision to impose a fee structure based on their (the parents') annual income. the decision was taken at an emergency working committee meeting of the pune parents' association (ppa) held at the sardar dastur girls' high school on sunday. though the ppa did not have a copy of the government resolution in this regard, ppa convenor sudarshan nair told the times of india, that parents will not accept an income-based fee-structure in the 32 aided english medium schools in pune and pimpri-chinchwad areas. the ppa has already sent letters of protest to state education minister ramkrishna more and other education officials, he said.the ppa is also in touch with parents' associations in mumbai in order to stage a combined struggle against the fee hike, mr nair added. at present, aided english medium schools do not charge tuition fees. the government pays grant towards salaries of school teachers. ""parents pay a fixed amount, not more than rs 1,500 per year, at the beginning of every academic year to take care of other administrative expenses,"" explains mr nair. if the government stopped paying grants, the schools will have to raise the money through a new fee structure prescribed by the government. according to the government proposal, parents with annual income up to rs 50,000 will not be asked to pay any fees. parents with incomes between rs 50,000 to rs 1 lakh will have to pay rs 100 per month per student, while those with an income of rs 1 to rs 2 lakh will be asked to pay rs 200 per month. similarly, an income between rs 2 and rs 3 lakh will attract a monthly fee of rs 300 per month, and an income of more than rs 3 lakh will push the monthly fee up to rs 400. if despite the new fee structure, the schools are unable to raise money equivalent to the grant amount, the school authorities have been given the discretion to hike the fees further. ""schools which have deliberately kept down the number of students will suffer the most because there will be fewer students from whom to raise the requisite money,"" he explained.

""had help from the police or fire-fighting units come, we could have saved at least some of our belongings, but now we are on the streets and we don't know where to go. because of help from some neighbours we dared to jump out. they stood outside our house to catch us. otherwise we would have been charred to death,"" she said still visibly distraught.

""the recent supreme court judgment which categorically declared sonia gandhi as an indian citizen has knocked the bottom out of ncp's stand. the ncp was formed by sharad pawar on the single-point issue of sonia gandhi being a foreigner. now this has become a perfect non-issue after the sc's verdict,"" mr adik observed. however, loyal congressmen are opposing the entry of ncp workers. but mr adik has been telling them that the ncp members were earlier in the congress. ""if they have realised their mistake of joining the ncp and want to return to the congress fold, there is no harm,"" he has reasoned. this is for the first time mr adik will be touring western maharashtra after the supreme court verdict. the 'siddhata yatra' was launched by sonia gandhi at a function on august 24 in pune where she handed over the party tricolour to mr adik. the mpcc chief has since been treversing the length and breadth of the state, braving the heat, spreading the message of sonia gandhi. he has so far covered aurangabad, jalna, parbhani, beed, osmanabad, latur, nanded, hingoli, washim, buldana, akola, amravati, yavatmal, wardha, jalgaon, dhule, nandurbar and nashik districts. on october 13, he will start his tour of the konkan and, on october 18, enter western maharashtra. the tour is aimed at boosting the morale of the rank and file of the party and prepare them for the december 2 elections to 172 municipal councils. ever since he took charge as the mpcc president on march 4, 2000, mr adik has been trying to strengthen the organisation with the long-term goal of the party winning the next assembly polls on the basis of its own strength. this is the fourth time ever since he took over the mpcc that mr adik has been extensively touring the state. he commenced the 'nirdhar yatra' last august and followed it up in january with a 'dushkal daura' with a view to monitor drought relief operations of the government. he undertook yet another tour to take part in party training camps all over the state. these camps were held in all the 650 talukas and also at the district level. it was topped with a seven-day state level camp at karla.

15,Bihar govt concerned over aging planes,"patna: the air crash in mainpuri in up which claimed the lives of senior congress leader madhavrao scindia and others, including journalists, has drawn the bihar government's attention to its aging fleet of planes used by the chief minister, ministers, senior officials and other dignitaries. the comptroller and auditor general, in a report, indicted bihar ministers for using ""uran khatola"" as rjd chief laloo prasad yadav calls these planes like a taxi. several ministers have hastily stopped using state government planes after the air crash. while receiving the body of journalist ranjan jha killed in the air crash, laloo murmured the need for buying a new plane. the bihar government currently has a nine-seater plane purchased 24 years ago and another 16-year-old two-seater plane. it also has two choppers out of which only one is used. parts of the other chopper are used to keep this one ""airworthy"". the resource crunch prevents the state government from buying a new plane costing about rs 18 crore. ""we sent a proposal for purchasing a new plane under the modernisation programme. but it has been rejected by the finance department,"" stated the chief pilot-cum-additional secretary of the state civil aviation department, captain avinash kumar. incidentally, the demand made by dgp r r prasad for a chopper for ""tackling crime"" under the police modernisation scheme has also met with a cold response from the finance department. kumar said one of the planes used by bihar ministers is of the same type as the nine-seater king air c-90 which crashed in up. but the mishap might have occurred due to adverse weather conditions or pilot error. ""it is not proper to blame the plane if accident takes place due to adverse weather conditions or pilot error,"" he remarked. he said the himachal pradesh government planes involved in two other crashes were new ones. the bihar government planes are perfectly well maintained, he added. both the planes in the current bihar government fleet were purchased before the laloo era. old timers say when the nine-seater plane was purchased, the then chief minister satyendra narayan sinha used to take keen interest even in the minute detail such as the cover to be used for the seats. in the early 1990s, laloo used the ""uran khatola"" as a symbol of his newly acquired power. he was never tired of telling voters at his public meetings that the ""uran khatola"" once used by ""zamindars"" (landlords) as he then called his predecessors, was being used by the son of the poor masses. he had created a flutter once by offering to take a group of ghasgarhni (women grasscutters) for a joyride on the plane. ""however, his interest in the plane has remained confined to taking him to his destinations,"" remarked an official of the state civil aviation department. now that the need for a new plane is being felt, the state government finds its coffers empty.

17,UP Govt fears communal violence,"lucknow: the up government fears a threat to communal harmony in the state following us strikes on afghanistan sunday. following the al-qaida chief's terming the us retaliatory strikes against afghanistan as a ``war against islam'', the top intelligence agencies have sent an urgent report to the state government expressing strong apprehensions of a totally ``unpredictable'' spate of communal violence in up. ``the communal situation in the state may take an unpredictable turn and the measures we have so far taken may not be adequate to meet the emerging trends,'' a source in the department told times news network quoting the report. the report further said that the fall-out of an incident would not necessarily be confined to the area of occurrence. therefore, it was important to keep fully abreast of all developments within and outside india. ``effective contingency plans must be prepared,'' it warned. the home department is learnt to have issued instructions to the top officials of the administration and the police across the state to ensure peace and communal harmony at all costs. directives have been issued that senior officials must regularly meet to assess the situation and inform the home department and the director-general of police at once about any such development.

18,Bihar govt may not be able to meet plan targets,"patna: the bihar finance bill (bfb), which was passed by the state legislature in march, is yet to receive presidential assent. while finance and planning departments officials maintain that the state will comfortably attain the plan target of rs 2,644 crore, facts suggest to the contrary. with central assistance constituting about 80 per cent of the annual plan outlay, any cut in the same could land the state in financial troubles. if the finance bill is cleared, it would provide the state government with an additional fund of rs 250 crore annually through amendments in the bihar finance act, 1981, indian stamp act, 1899, bihar entertainments duty, court-fees and stamp (surcharge amendment) act, 1948, and the bihar motor vehicles taxation act, 1994. the transport department hopes to mobilise an additional rs 180 crore annually by amending the motor vehicles taxation act. however, the delay has already caused it a loss of rs 90 crore. the government had also hoped to collect an additional rs 20 crore annually by amending the bihar finance act, 1981, which would empower it to impose a surcharge not exceeding 10 per cent on sales-tax and additional tax on registered dealers whose gross turnover during a year exceeded rs 5 lakh. however, state government officials have put up a brave face, saying they had anticipated such a situation and finalised the annual plan, keeping such developments in mind. the plan size would not be effected, they added. they said the planning commission had released an additional assistance of rs 100 crore, apart from releasing rs 122.16 crore for the current financial year under the local bodies head, even as the state government had failed to hold the panchayat elections last year. however, sources said the delay would have a telling impact on the plan size as the state government did not have adequate resources.

22,Modi asks to help improve party image,"ahmedabad: chief minister narendra modi on monday called upon partymen to keep away from ""manthara"" type characters as they were more dangerous than ravan, who represented evil in epic ramayana. addressing the first meeting of party workers at the bjp headquarters here, modi did some plain-speaking and exhorted them to distance themselves from critics within the organisation more than those outside, because insiders could prove more harmful. as disciplined soldiers, he said, they should not fall into traps laid by vested interests _ and run here and there for transfers _ as such elements tarnished the image of the party. he said he was sent to gujarat to refurbish the image and the sagging morale of party workers by establishing rapport which he had received during his tenure as organising secretary few years ago. ""i am passing through a critical period of my life and seek your support in this difficult task of chief ministership, which could not be accomplished without you help."" modi said the active worker was the engine full of power for any political party, and in no circumstances should he be ignored. he was crucial for the interface between the party and the people. the bjp cannot afford complacency on the part of workers as they alone could spread the message of programmes and policies of the government.

23,Involve more NGOs for development: Modi,"gandhinagar: chief minister narendra modi on monday directed the officials to adopt a new people-oriented approach and involve voluntary organisations in a big way to accelerate the pace of development in the state. while addressing his first meeting with the secretaries and senior officials, modi said the officials should try to minimise the role of the government and hand over the works to ngos and lending agencies, as this would yield better results than the government. recalling the excellent work done by ngos in rehabilitation and relief works in the aftermath of natural calamities in the state, modi stressed on the need for participation of people through voluntary organisations. referring to rapid growth of information technology, modi advocated the need for strengthening of bio-technology, which would be a major pre-requisite for the development of agricultural sector. the information technology cell should at the earliest develop a new software under its e-governance programme so that people living in the remote area could directly speak to chief minister about their problems. expressing concern about high rate of illiteracy among women, the chief minister called upon the officials to find out ways and means to improve the standard of women's literacy as the government has decided to accord priority to women's literacy in the coming days. besides this, other priorities would be fast completion of the narmada project and fulfill the promise of jobs to unemployed given by the previous government. in regard to evils that have cropped up in the transfer of the government staff, modi asked secretaries to strictly follow the guidelines evolved for the transfers. he said the departmental heads should create a special data of those seeking transfers and if this record was maintained, there was no need for the officials to succumb to any pressures for effecting transfers.
