0,PM is not superior to the party: RSS,"new delhi: rss spokesperson m.g. vaidya on friday said that the party and the government were at par, with neither superior to the other. both play complementary roles and vajpayee cannot be superior to the party that made him pm, vaidya said. the statement comes in the wake of reports about the uneasy relationship between bjp president jana krishnamurthy and the party's leaders in the government. it is too early to say whether vaidya's statement would have any impact, but tensions between krishnamurthy and the government have been building up since the pm first spoke of a ""communication gap"" between the two at last month's bjp national council meeting. the perceived snub to krishnamurthy was reinforced last week when three of the four sessions of the bjp national executive meeting in amritsar were chaired by party vice-president madan lal khurana. if that wasn't bad enough, unknown to krishnamurthy, law minister arun jaitley, while briefing the press on november 2, quoted advani as having said at the national executive that ""those who oppose poto are appeasing terrorists"". a surprised krishnamurthy told the press the next day that advani could not have said that, and offered to check with advani himself. four days later, advani himself told the social editors' conference that jaitley had quoted him right. this was seen as a double snub for krishnamurthy, who is close to advani. a day later, advani said both men were right, but it appeared to be an afterthought. the tension between krishnamurthy and the government goes back to his first national executive as president in july this year, when the party virtually set the agenda for the government. brajesh mishra criticised new delhi: vaidya criticised pm's principal secretary brajesh mishra for his bangladesh mission to discuss with dhaka leaders the atrocities against hindus that began after the bnp-led government was sworn-in. ""there has been no appreciable difference after his visit. thousands of hindus have crossed over to india and others are being forced to pay money to the ruling coalition's cadre. this is some sort of jiziya or poll tax,"" vaidya said.

3,Govt plans law reforms to clear courts' backlog,"mumbai: it is said statistics speak for themselves. check this. there are three crore cases pending in courts netionwide. in regular courts, the backlog is a staggering two crore even as 1.5 lakh cases are being filed daily. two-thirds of the pending cases are criminal cases. the supreme court itself has a backlog of 21,000 cases. there are 5.32 lakh companies registered under the companies act of which 50 per cent do not file returns at all and 80 per cent of profit-making companies don't declare their dividends. as many as eight lakh cases involving bounced cheques are pending all over india. union law minister arun jaitley, who was in the city to deliver the 35th walchand memorial lecture on the `need to reform judicial system to expedite judicial process', gave the figures on wednesday. lamenting the slow disposal of criminal cases, he said the conviction rate was a mere 6.5 per cent. speaking to this newspaper later, the minister said various law reform proposals were in the pipeline. significant among them are the simplification of the land acquisition procedure, the arbitration act and the negotiable instruments act. mr jaitley said efforts were on to draw the acquisition of land and payment procedure into a one-year time frame. at present, land acquisition processes take years to complete, with evaluation often being disputed in courts. the compensation package for rural land should also be more remunerative, he noted. the minister, who is keen to work out an effective solution to reduce judicial delays, said the law ministry has a five-pronged agenda to tackle the vexed issue. the methodologies proposed include simplification of procedural laws - both the civil procedure code (cpc) and the criminal procedure code (crpc). the amended cpc is likely to come up before the parliament soon. but aren't these very long-drawn methods? mr jaitley retorted that it was not so easy to solve the problem. he observed that there could be no immediate solutions. he said the concept of fast-track courts in the country was fast catching up with the masses and complimented maharashtra for having taken a lead in this regard. the centre had sanctioned infrastructure for setting up 1,734 fast track courts in the country. so far 800 have come up in various states, he said. the minister also was in favour of the concept of a jail judge. he said a recent experiment in tihar jail showed good results. ``a jail judge can do quick justice and dispose of bail matters on the spot.'' the law minister is attempting at putting up one substantive law for amendment in the parliament every session. ``we had amended personal laws recently,'' he said. he did, to his credit, make divorce easier for christian women with the amendment to the indian divorce act. next on the agenda is the proposal to make all infrastructural disputes go before regulatory authorities with appeals directly before the supreme court. in the context of public utilities, a proposal is already pending to direct disputes regarding telephone or electricity bills to a pre-litigative stage before lok adalats. subordinate courts, at least in the four main metros to begin with, are soon going to be computerised. mr jaitley said the centre will be footing the bill and if the ``project succeeds, it will be emulated in district courts.''

4,Stay questioning Lakhani's election vacated,"vadodara: a city court has vacated a stay order that had challenged m s university students' union (msusu) general secretary mehul lakhani's contesting and subsequent election to the post. the stay was vacated on wednesday. former general secretary of commerce faculty students' association amit ghotikar had challenged lakhani's election in the court. ghotikar objected to lakhani's employment with the vadodara municipal corporation, arguing that the very fact that lakhani was employed makes him ineligible to contest students' union elections. however, the argument was not considered valid or justified to remove lakhani from the elected post. ""i was having a part-time employment which in no way breaches the norms of the msusu. the nsu-i was not able to digest its defeat and hence decided to make an issue out of my part-time job and tried to harass me,"" lakhani said. he has now filed a caveat in the upper court. ghotikar's counsel narendra tiwari, on the other hand, has asked for more time from the court. ""unlike some former nsu-i student leaders, i did not take money from students promising them admissions but took a part- time job. what i did is a legitimate way of earning a little while studying,"" lakhani said.

7,Kalyan's RKP rally a surprise for many,"lucknow: dubbed a one man show the massive turnout at the rashtriya kranti party (rkp) rally came as a surprise to many who had virtually written the political obituary of former chief minister, kalyan singh. the rkp president himself could barely conceal his glee and wished that chief minister rajnath singh took an aerial view of what he described as a kumbh ka mela on the banks of river gomti. presented with many a garland with one of them weighing 21 kgs, crowns and a bow and arrow by national general-secretary kusum rai, the former chief minister took a snipe at his former party by stating that it had dumped him after making full use of him ekeala chod diya, raste main log milte gain, karavan badta gaya (they left me alone, people met me on the way and the caravan increased). the rally also provided singh with an opportunity to dwell on his inner fears after he was expelled from the bjp and how he overcame them. referring to the withdrawal of his security and the consequent threat to his life singh recited a urdu couplet jab se suna hai ke maut ka hi naam zindagi hai, woh sar par kafan bandh kar maut ko doondh te hain. more than anything else, the rally saw father kalyan singh seated beside his son rajbir singh their earlier differences notwithstanding. rajbir who now holds the post of state general-secretary also delivered a short speech leading many to comment that his formal initiation into politics had now been made. however, it was kusum rai who made all the announcements and was presented with a crown and chundri. rai who spewed venom at the bjp and its leaders described kalyan singh as an atom bomb and one who would put an end to the bjps misrule. she said aye ravano ke vansho, aye kans ke vansho, tera khatma hone ka waqt a gaya (descendants of ravana and kansa, your end is coming near now).

8,Punjab elections in mid-February: EC,"chandigarh:punjab is likely to have the next assembly elections in mid-february. election commissioner tk krishnamurthy said here on friday that formal announcement of the dates would be made four to six weeks before the term of the present house expires on march 2. talking to mediapersons, he said this time electronic voting machines (evms) would be used in the entire state even as photo-identity cards would be mandatory for those seeking to exercise their franchise. he directed the state election authorities to expedite the process of making identity cards and cover at least 80-85 per cent of voters by the end of next month. he, however, expressed dissatisfaction at the present rate of making identity cards in the state. commenting on the use of evms, he said the commission had decided to utilise them in all constituencies. after their successful use in the past, it was found that for smooth, peaceful and transparent elections evms played a vital role. he denied that evms were in anyway susceptible to tampering or misuse. the commission had got them examined by independent technical experts and it was found that tampering was not feasible. hardly one per cent of complaints received about working of evms were related to manipulation in their use, and that too were subsequently found baseless. mostly it was human error which caused the problem, he said. the commission, he said, was particularly worried about increasing criminalisation of politics. he said the commission had suggested amendment in the election law with a view to barring all those political leaders from contesting who had been chargesheeted for an offence attracting atleast five-year imprisonment. he also suggested realistic limit of expenditure that should be laid down for candidates. at present, there are many loopholes which have made the present ceiling infructuous, he said.

10,Centre's move on grains upsets CM,"hyderabad: chief minister n chandrababu naidu on friday voiced his strong protest over union food minister shanta kumar's observations that the centre would not procure foodgrains from farmers in future. according to reports, shanta kumar had told a group of editors in new delhi that the centre would limit its role to fixing the minimum support price (msp) for foodgrains and ask the food corporation of india (fci), which is currently procuring paddy and rice from the farmers, to get out of the business. the farmers will have to approach the open market to sell their produce in future. naidu, who was briefed about the possible implications of centre's decision on thursday morning, immediately called up shanta kumar and has reportedly taken serious objection to this move by the centre. official sources say that naidu had impressed upon the union minister about the adverse impact on the farmers if the fci were to stop procurement of foodgrains. naidu asked the minister to reconsider the decision, as it would worsen the situation in the state. later naidu told the times of india that the centre has yet to take a final decision about the new policy and he would oppose any such move. shanta kumar reportedly tried to convince naidu that his observations were part of a committee's recommendations about overhauling foodgrain management in the country and reduce government expenditure on procurement. the state government has had serious problems with slow procurement by the fci during the last season and had to face the wrath of farmers and political opponents. ""if the centre goes ahead with the decision, our state will be worst affected,"" a senior officer remarked. naidu will take up the matter with prime minister vajpayee during his visit to delhi scheduled on nov 15.

23,"`In handling bad news, honesty is the best policy'","mumbai: last week, we examined the four guidelines that the authorities have to keep in mind while trying to inform and reassure an anxious public faced with a new and unfamiliar threat. * adopt a policy of full disclosure about what is and is not known, and deliver information in a non-patronising manner. * give a detailed accounting of what is being done to counter the threat. * avoid speculation and never mix facts with reassurance. * recommend specific steps that people may take to protect themselves. in the first few days after the discovery of anthrax in florida, experts say u.s. government officials violated almost each of these guidelines. ``health and law enforcement authorities made confident statements that later proved false, tried simultaneously to inform and reassure, and limited the flow of information to the public,'' reports erica goode in the new york times. ``agencies issued conflicting statements. officials speculated about what had happened or what might happen. and they simultaneously warned americans about vague dangers while urging them to go about their lives.'' the latter boondoggle is known as a `double bind' in transaction analysis, and is equivalent to setting up a roadblock while simultaneously flashing the `go-ahead' green light. in contrast, the experts cited the performance of rudy giuliani, new york city's former mayor, during his daily press briefings about the city's anthrax exposures as providing a model of how a crisis is most effectively handled. ``the mayor had consistently done the right thing __ appeal to people's most rational selves,'' the nyt report adds. in this context, it's vital to remember that people often respond to terrorism, disasters and other kinds of trauma with shock and denial. the fact that they have to depend on experts for accurate information exacerbates the problem further. similarly, while there is no such thing as a `standard' pattern of response to extreme stress and trauma, wilful human acts seem to do more harm to mental health than acts of god. in such circumstances, experts say the best communication strategy is to simplify and to clarify and to hold onto a rational assessment of the threat by constantly putting the numbers and events in the proper context. ``also, it's far better to admit what we do not know rather than make firm but unfounded declarations in an attempt to reassure,'' said dr george loewenstein, professor of economics and psychology at carnegie mellon. other experts add that people can handle a lot more uncertainty than officials give them credit for, and that soothing but false reassurances ultimately undermine public trust. ``shooting from the hip with a definite (read upbeat\feel good) answer is not a clever way to go,'' harvard professor of science and public policy sheila jasanoff told the new york times ``it's more credible to say, `we can't yet make predictions about this or statements about that.''' all this only reiterates what's taught in journalism schools __ that accuracy, reliability and unbiased reporting are essential ingredients of credibility. it also challenges what some experts have described as the quintessentially american ethos of `unrelenting positivity'.
