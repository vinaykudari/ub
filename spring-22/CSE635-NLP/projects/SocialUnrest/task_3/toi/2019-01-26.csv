0,'Ground Zero' gears up for protests and tears on R-Day,"bhuj: the tricolour will not flutter proudly in kutch on january 26 this year. perhaps, for the first time in the history of free india, the residents of the largest district in the country will not show the same patriotic fervour on republic day. instead, many will protest and mourn their dead. there is already an upsurge of emotion around 'ground zero' of the earthquake which devastated the district one year ago. january 26 is likely to bring forth those emotions which remained bottled up for months. not surprisingly, most of the sentiment is arraigned against the state government. in bhachau, the worst-hit town of kutch, you are greeted at the first intersection with a freshly painted sign on the road. january 26 bhachau bandh. it's 6 am and life is just dawning on this town. with the tin sheds not protecting the residents from the biting cold they sit outside around burning logs of wood. and, they talk of only one thing. how they have not been paid their rs 12,000 compensation even after 12 months. in fact, one resident shows a cheque she received in december. by then she had borrowed so much money from the lender that there was nothing left of the cash dole. needless to say, republic day is the last thing on her mind. bhachau will remain closed on january 26 as the lok adhikar manch has called for a bandh and it seems to have large-scale support. as one resident put it, ""they declare national holidays when political leaders die. why can't we have a bandh when so many of our people have died?"" residents of bhuj, on the other hand, are already on the way out for jan 26, 27 and 28. rumours of another earthquake, fuelled by the tremors of january 23 have ensured that they are scared out of their wits for republic day. those staying back will spend the days in tents outside their houses. ""what republic day,"" asks neeraj khatri. ""i'm taking my family away from kutch for january 26. i prefer to see all of them alive rather than celebrate anything."" chinmay banerjee, on the other hand, wants to maintain normalcy at his school, k g manek english school, despite the rumours. a member of the anjar 2001 group, he holds meetings with parents of troublesome children in his school. ""we don't want a bandh on january 26 but it all depends on what the chief minister declares during his visit here on saturday."" ""if he ensures better implementation of the promises already made i see no problem. otherwise we will call for a bandh,"" he explains. even as banerjee speaks, a car with loudspeakers blares about the 'dharti poojan' that the gujarat government has organised all over kutch. chief minister narendra modi's visit has, however, ensured one thing. better roads for the people of kutch. everywhere you see road-repairing activity in full swing. roads that were completely unpliable one year ago in the region today make for smooth riding. but residents hope the government paves a way for a better future for the kutchis, too.
