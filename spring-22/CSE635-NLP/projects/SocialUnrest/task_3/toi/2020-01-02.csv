0,RSP appeals for end to clashes,"KOLKATA: The RSP, a constituent of the Left Front in West Bengal, urged to its bigbrother â€” the CPM to tame party members and to start a dialogue to stop political clashes, especially in South 24 Parganas. On Wednesday a CPM activist was killed in a clash between the two parties at Bharatir More under Basanti police station in the district.

The CPM on the other hand said that it was closely watching the recent development in the district. Ironically, in the Basanti incident RSP supporters were the aggressors. RSP state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay told TNN that just before the panchayat election incidents of political clash were increasing.

â€œWednesdayâ€™s incident is unfortunate.We have been telling the CPM party bigwigs to think twice on the prevailing law and order situation of the district. The district is a stronghold for the RSP and the CPM has been trying to capture it. The incident may be a fallout of it,â€� he said.

Bandopadhyayâ€” who is a former member of the Jyoti Basu cabinetâ€” said that his party had already urged the CPM to initiate bilateral talk to stop political clashes in the area. â€œ We may discuss the matter at the ensuing Left Front meeting,â€� he said. Meanwhile CPM leader of the district Sujan Chakraborty said that it was a deliberate killing. â€œ We want peace. We will not tolerate such disturbances and do anything to restore peace,â€� Chakraborty said.

â€œEnayatâ€™s father Mukkadesh Khan and mother both were injured. His father was former RSP leader and latter switched over to our party,â€� he added. Describing the incident DIG (HQ) Narayan Chandra Ghosh told newspersons that a group of people between 18 to 20 years of age were playing cricket at a ground near Bharatir-more. All of a sudden, RSP activists, 50 to 60 in numbers came to the ground and attacked them. Later they hurled bombs. One CPM man, Enayat (26) was found laying on the spot with heavy injury. Then and there Enayat was taken to the nearest hospital and later died there. In retaliation, infuriated CPM activists stormed the houses of the RSP supporters and set them ablaze.

2,Officer involved in fake encounter arrested,"PATNA: The additional officer-in-charge of the Shastrinagar police station, Shamsi Alam, who has been in the eye of a storm following his involvement in the alleged fake encounter in Ashiana Nagar which claimed three lives on Saturday, was sent to jail after being produced in the court of chief judicial magistrate here on Wednesday. Senior SP Sunil Kumar confirmed that Alam was sent to the Beur jail.

Shamsi was put under suspension after the lodging of an FIR by Mukesh Ranjan, brother of Vikash, one of the three slain youths. He was holding the post of additional OC in the absence of an inspector-rank police officer in the police station.

Meanwhile, the police are yet to arrest other accused policemen involved in the ""fake"" encounter. On Wednesday, new Sachivalaya DSP Arshad Zama joined his office replacing controversial DSP Ajit Kumar Sinha.

Though Patna returned to normalcy on Wednesday following the violent agitation which gripped a major part of the city during the Tuesdayâ€™s bandh call, public anger over the fake encounter is yet to get over.

Traders in Ashiana Nagar opened their shops on Wednesday while vehicular movement remained uninterrupted. Some BJP workers were seen undertaking a ""signature campaign"" in front of Patna Zoo on Bailey Road. According to them, the signatures will be sent to the Union government and the President to apprise them of the situation in Bihar.

The administration has got its two anti-riot vehicles ""Vajra"" parked in front of the Kotwali police station. Moreover, about 100 lathi-wielding jawans of BMP and homeguards continued to camp on the premises of Kotwali police till late afternoon. However, the administration avoided deploying forces in Ashiana Nagar which had become a ""battlefield"" for the ""warring"" police and agitators during the Tuesdayâ€™s bandh call.

Various NDA leaders, including former Union minister C P Thakur, leader of opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi, state BJP president Nand Kishore Yadav, Samata leader P K Sinha and JD (U) leader Laxmi Sahu, took out a silent march on Wednesday in protest against the killing of the three youths.

The march ended at the JP roundabout with the leaders taking a ""vow"" to continue peopleâ€™s agitation. They distributed a leaflet among people accusing the police of ""patronising criminals"" and containing other allegations levelled against the Rabri government.

3,NDA planning major stir to protest students' deaths,"PATNA: The killing of three innocent students in Ashiana Nagar area here by the police in an alleged â€˜fakeâ€™ encounter on Saturday and also the killing of two persons in police firing at Manjhaul in Begusarai district recently, are likely to be made a big issue by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which is planning to launch a 1974-type ""peopleâ€™s agitation"" to overthrow the present Laloo-Rabri regime.

Samata spokesman Shambhu Sharan Shrivastava, who reached here on Wednesday, informed mediapersons that the wrath of people in the wake of the â€˜fake encounterâ€™, which was manifest in the grand success of Patna bandh on Tuesday, has shown that a situation similar to 1974 prevails today and the only solution lies in overthrowing the present regime through a united movement.

The partyâ€™s national general secretary Satish Prasad, state vice-president Shyam Sunder Singh â€˜Dheerajâ€™ and state spokesman P K Sinha, MLC, were also present at the press conference. Satish and Dheeraj said that the party has decided to postpone its proposed dharna programme to be held here on January 3 in view of the recent developments.

Shrivastava said that the partyâ€™s national president and defence minister George Fernandes will reach here by morning flight on Thursday in his capacity as the convener of the NDAâ€™s coordination committee. He will address a joint meeting of the NDA constituents and meet the families of the three deceased students before meeting mediapersons. The form of agitation against the state government will be decided at the NDA meeting, he added.

""Peopleâ€™s mandate and majority in the state assembly does not allow a party or its leader to act in an autocratic way and do what it/he likes. Paani ab sar se upar bahne laga hai"", he commented in an indirect reference to the cold-blooded murder of youths in Patna and Manjhaul. He said that his party has already demanded the resignation of Rabri Devi government on moral grounds.

""If her government fails to resign, an agitation will be launched in Bihar by all the NDA constituents and the people of the state to overthrow it,"" he said and appealed to all opposition parties, particularly the Left, to join hands. The issue involved is protection of human rights. ""If it is not possible to form a joint front of all opposition parties by rising above the party lines to launch a united agitation, there can be coordination between them for a synchronised movement to dislodge the present regime,"" he stated.

Shrivastava also appealed to the Congress to withdraw from the present government, which no longer requires its support in the name of secularism to be in power, and give up its lust to be in power and apologise to the people for being a party in all the â€˜misdeedsâ€™ of the regime.

5,"Milk supply normal, foodgrains hit","BANGALORE: Even as the Bangalore City Corporation (BCC) and the BAMUL made alternative arrangements to ensure clearance of garbage and milk supply on Wednesday, the Karnataka Lorry Ownersâ€™ Association claimed that the lorry strike launched on Tuesday midnight was â€œtotalâ€™â€™ and vowed it will continue till the government responds.

As a fallout of the strike that brought to a halt more than 2.75 lakh trucks and transport vehicles, vegetables and foodgrains could not be supplied to Kalasipalyam market and RMC Yard at Yeshwanthpur. â€œNo lorries were allowed into the premises,â€™â€™ traders said.

Expressing satisfaction, Association President B. Channa Reddy ruled out withdrawing the strike â€œtill the government comes up with a responseâ€™â€™.

BCC Deputy Commissioner (Administration) V. Srirama Reddy said 125 tippers from various departments and 10 from the public works department have been put on the job. Drivers and workers are being paid overtime charges, he added.

Normally, about 350 lorries are used for lifting and disposing garbage but with the BCC hiring 135 tippers, there is a shortfall of about 200 lorries.

â€œThe BCC will ensure minimal cleaning till the strike is called off,â€™â€™ Reddy said.

The BAMUL has borrowed 40 BMTC buses and 15 private maxi-cabs to distribute milk, its president B.S. Gangadhar said. On Wednesday, the dairy supplied 4.35 lakh litres of milk and 30,000 litres of curds. â€œWeâ€™re supplying products in excess to rule out shortage,â€™â€™ he added.

During his tour, the locals complained to Rajasekhara Reddy that not a single Janmabhoomi meeting was held in the colony, nor any of them received benefits under Adarna, Roshni and Mundagudu schemes.

Some old people complained that they were not even getting the old age pensions. About 1,034 families were resettled at the Nandanavanam Colony near Karmanghat as part of the beautification of Musi river. The CLP leader also visited a school and enquired about the problems faced by students there.

8,"Patna encounter: Rabri govt should go, says Fernandes","PATNA: Expressing concern over surge in crimes and the killing of three students in a ""fake encounter"" in Bihar, Defence Minister and NDA Convener George Fernandes on Thursday said the ""corrupt and ineffective Rabri Devi government"" should be ousted but rejected a suggestion for a joint Parliament session to dismiss it.

""We have been saying not today but for the past ten years that the corrupt and ineffective government should go ... Even Samata Party was born in revolt against the corruption, anarchy and chaos unleashed during the Laloo-regime"", Fernandes told reporters at Jayaprakash Narayan International airport here on his arrival from Orissa.

In reply to a question, Fernandes said the Centre had not once but twice attempted to dismiss the present dispensation... But it failed to do so as the Congress and Left parties opposed the move as the NDA did not have required strength to pass the resolution in Rajya Sabha for dismissal of the government.

Rejecting the demand for a joint Parliament session to dismiss the Rabri Devi ministry, Fernandes said ""the Constitution doesn''t permit it"".

For any such move (dismissal of a government), both houses should pass the resolution separately, he said.

Referring to the demand for a CBI probe into the killing of three youths in a fake encounter with police at Ashiana Nagar on Saturday, Fernandes said there was no need for any inquiry into the incident.

""It is a cold-blooded murder and has exceeded all limits of barbarism...Guilty should be punished immediately"", he said.

Appreciating the youths for their courage and unity shown during the December 31 Patna bandh to protest the alleged fake encounter, Fernandes said the agitation was taking a form of the students'' movement that culminated in the ouster of Indira Gandhi regime and added that the days of Laloo-Rabri regime seemed numbered if the present movement continued.

He called upon the opposition parties to collectively take the battle against the government to its logical end.

Fernandes also urged the media to cooperate in the struggle.

He later met the bereaved families of the three youths.

Fernandes is scheduled to address a meeting of NDA constituents for taking a collective decision on the course of agitation against the ""encounter"" later on Thursday.

9,Hand over Ayodhya land by Feb 22: VHP to govt,"NEW DELHI: Mounting a renewed offensive on the Ram temple issue, the VHP on Thursday served an ultimatum to the BJP-led NDA government to return the ""undisputed"" land, acquired by the Centre at Ayodhya, before February 22 or face confrontation.

""The Margdarshak Mandal is meeting on February 21, while the Dharam Sansad is meeting from February 22 to 24 to discuss the Ayodhya issue. We demand that our land be returned to us before that,"" VHP Senior Vice-President Acharya Giriraj Kishore told reporters here.

He said the VHP has constituted a committee to implement the decisions taken by the Dharam Sansad. The three-member panel, led by S C Dikshit, former Director General of Uttar Pradesh Police and former BJP MP from Varanasi, comprises senior VHP leaders Rajendra Singh ''Pankaj'' and Champat Rai.

""We have no faith in the words of politicians. We will follow every word of the decisions taken by the Dharam Sansad,"" he said.

To a question on similar announcements made by VHP last year ahead of its much-hyped ''Shiladaan'' on March 15, he said, ""we were cheated (by the government) at that time. This time we are prepared for the worst. At the most, they may arrest us or open fire on us. We are ready for that.""

He said the recent VHP national executive at Pune had passed resolutions on terrorism as also Ram Janambhoomi issue which had categorically stated that the Central government would be fully responsible for any confrontation.

The meeting had also passed separate resolutions on the issue of cow protection and conversions.

11,Curfew in Lunawada after renewed violence,"VADODARA: Violence continued for the second day in sensitive Lunawada, near Godhra, as another round of stone-pelting and arson was reported on Thursday.

Curfew had to be clamped to maintain law and order after the police used tear-gas shells to disperse mobs that took to the streets, throwing stones and acid bulbs. Mobs resorted to arson and looted a number of shops, while some kiosks were set ablaze near the town''s bus stand and in areas like Bhoiwad and Beda Fadia, said Panchmahals SP Narsimha Komar.

Additional forces have been rushed from Surat. Curfew was clamped around 6 pm and police continued combing operations in the troubled areas. Till late on Thursday, the police had recovered a large number of swords, sharp weapons and crude bombs.

Trouble began on Wednesday reportedly over a tiff between members of two communities in a queue for voter I-cards. Police sources, however, revealed that the violence might have been triggered by an affair between the daughter of a government official and a local boy who belonged to another community. This bears an uncanny similarity with the source of the trouble in Dahod, where complaints were lodged about girls being teased.
