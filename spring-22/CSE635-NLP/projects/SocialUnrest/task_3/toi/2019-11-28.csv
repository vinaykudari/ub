0,Cane farmers call off 2-month long agitation,"MEERUT: The more than two-month-long stir by the sugarcane growers which had virtually paralysed life across western UP was called off on Wednesday, following the decision by sugar mill owners to re-open their mills for crushing of sugarcane.

While some private and government-owned sugar mills in Meerut and Saharanpur divisions had decided to resume crushing on Tuesday, following an agreement reached between the agitating farmers and the sugar mill owners, others decided to re-open their units on Wednesday, following the Centreâ€™s announcement to create a buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes of sugar.

The buffer stock of sugar will make available Rs 786 crore for payment to sugarcane growers facing hardships due to non-receipt of their pending dues.

With the sugarcane growers deciding to call off their stir, the sugar mill owners and others have also heaved a sigh of relief.

A large number of tourists and other travellers had also been stranded along the Delhi-Dehra Dun national highway and other state highways including the Delhi-Saharanpur highway for more than a week due to continuous blockade by agitating farmers on these highways.

Virtual lawlessness had prevailed across the Meerut, Saharanpur and Moradabad divisions, after angry farmers began to hold hostage senior officers of the sugar mills and other state government employees. Several officers and other employees of the sugarcane offices in Meerut, Saharanpur, Bulandshahr and Muzaffarnagar had been allegedly beaten up and threatened with the dire consequences during the stir. The policemen were just seen expressing their helplessness in rescuing the sugar mill employees due to fear of reprisal by the agitating farmers.

According to deputy cane commissioner (Meerut), while four mills belonging to Meerut and Bulandshahr had resumed functioning on Tuesday, sugar mill owners of Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Moradabad districts decided to re-open their units on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Centreâ€™s announcement to create a buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes of sugar has been welcomed by most sugarcane growers and sugar mill owners, as it reportedly fulfils the demands they had been raising so strongly.

According to them, while the announcement to this effect helps concede the two main demands of the sugarcane growners â€” the re-opening of sugar mills and payment of their dues â€” sugar mill owners will also not be forced to buy the sugarcane from the farmers at the rates more than the rates fixed by the Centre last year.

2,Jamir wants peaceful polls,"NEW DELHI: Nagaland chief minister S C Jamir has urged the Centre to take an undertaking from the rebel Issak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) that it will not cause any disturbance during the state assembly elections in February.

Jamir, who has been camping here, met Prime Minister Vajpayee on Wednesday and urged him to get a firm assurance from the NSCN (I-M) that its activists would not â€˜â€˜intimidate or attack the voters or party workersâ€™â€™. He would also meet Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Thursday.

These meetings assume importance after the Centre allowed the ban on the Naga insurgent group to lapse on Tuesday in view of the fact that it has invited the outfitâ€™s leaders for peace talks in India. Till now, the Centre has been holding peace talks with the NSCN (I-M) outside the country through a team led by former home secretary K Padmanabhaiah.

Significantly, for the first time, the talks here will be led by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. The lifting of the ban and the decision on the talks came following a meeting that Padmanabhaiah had with Muivah in Italy a few days ago, sources said.

One of the major conditions of the NSCN (I-M) for coming to India for the talks has been a lifting of the ban on the outfit. It was some two years ago that the ban on the outfit had been extended by the Centre. The NSCN had also demanded that the Prime Minister and his deputy be involved in the talks.

Jamir also briefed the Prime Minister about the law and order situation in Nagaland.

3,Opposition blames Marandi for annulment of domicile policy,"RANCHI: The main opposition parties in Jharkhand on Wednesday held Chief Minister Babulal Marandi responsible for the Jharkhand High Court''s striking down the ""local policy"" for employment in grade three and four.

""The government could very well have passed its policy through the Assembly and sought ratification in Parliament,"" a spokesman of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha said.

""The state government''s wrong part unnecessarily had sparked off large-scale violence in July,"" he said.

The general secretary of the Jharkhand unit of the Congrees, Gulfam Mujibi, said, ""From the very beggining we had been telling that the policy of the government was defective. Even a four-member committee of the party, which was formed to study the policy, had cited seven or eight defects in it.""

""This should be a lesson to the government which should now call upon all political parties to study the directions of the court and make a comprehensive policy,"" Mujibee said.

4,Sonia to address crucial party meet,"WARANGAL: AICC general secretary V Hanumantha Rao on Wednesday asserted that the ensuing meeting of Sonia Gandhi in Warangal would become a turning point in the state politics.

Addressing a press conference here at the Congress Bhavan, the senior Congress leader said the party was aiming to attract the betrayed BC,SC, ST and minority sections by reiterating its support to them through the meeting. He said that the Congress party had selected Warangal as the centre of awakening and the meeting scheduled for Dec. 21 would focus its attention on extending solidarity to issues relevant to weaker sections.

""The Congress party is in the fore front in this aspect right from the days of Indira Gandhi and it is keen on reassuring the stand through the Warangal meeting,"" he said.

The Congress leader said the meeting in Warangal would bring about a complete change in the political scenario of the state and the suppressed sections among the BCs representing various parties would prefer to return to the fold of the Congress after the conclave, he said.

Earlier in the day, the AICC secretary visited the Arts and Science College grounds in Subedari and inspected the venue along with district party president G V Ramana Reddy and local MLA Baswaraju Saraiah.

The party leadership in Warangal is making preparations for the meetings on a large scale and leaders say that the party would mobilise masses from all the Telangana districts.

City Congress chief Hari Rama Devi was also present at the press conference.

5,Anand fires salvo at NDA govt,"RANCHI: Making a scathing attack on the BJP-led NDA government, Rajya Sabha member and senior Supreme Court advocate R K Anand (Congress) said the situation in the country is worse than it was during the emergency.

Anand said people talk about the emergency imposed by late Indira Gandhi but then everyone knew that emergency had been imposed. What is happening today is worse than that. A leading English weekly''s office was raided because it carried an article against the Prime Minister and who would forget what has happened to the Tehelka team? he asked.

Anand, who delivered the keynote address on ""Human rights and the common man"" at the seminar organised by St Xavier''s College, Ranchi, here on Tuesday, reminded the media that violation of the right to information is also a violation of human rights because it is a very important right. He added that media censorship exists in America also.

What is noteworthy is that India has been signatory to every charter on human rights since 1948, but maximum violation of human rights is taking place here, Anand said.

He said when you lose the right to defend yourself then it is also a violation of human rights, and it is wrong to think that the top people do not become a victim of such violations. Citing the case of recent personal tragedies which seized senior Congress leader Natwar Singh, Anand said the way the media reported the event violated that family''s right to live with dignity.

He also stressed on the need for strict enforcement of the right to privacy. This is important because a police official is likely to misuse the recordings of intimate and confidential conversation between two persons in the name of keeping a vigil, he added.

Going back to the old times, he said neither Lakshman or Arjun used the Brahamashtra because they did not want to kill those who were not involved in the battle. But those principles have been forgotten, and what is happening today in Kashmir and other places where innocent people are being killed are also examples of human rights violations.

Advocate general A K Sinha, St Xavier''s College principal N Tete SJ, human rights activists and academicians participated in the seminar. On this occasion, the first journal published by Xavier Research Centre was also released.

6,HC dismisses election petition of Punit Rai,"PATNA: Justice P K Dev of the Patna High Court on Tuesday dismissed the election petition of defeated Janata Dal (United) candidate from Fatuha (reserved) assembly constituency Punit Rai, who had challenged the election of RJD candidate Dinesh Chaudhary from this seat.

The plea taken by the petitioner was that Chaudharyâ€™s father was a Kurmi by caste, which did not come in the category of reserved castes. But he failed to prove his case.

The respondent claimed though his father is a Kurmi by caste, his mother is a scheduled caste (SC), and, therefore, he was entitled to get the benefit of reservation. Senior advocate S N P Sharma, assisted by Amarendra Kumar Singh, appeared on behalf of the petitioner, while senior advocate Jayant Mitra and Gaurang Chatterjee for the respondent.

Non-compliance irks HC: The single bench of the Patna High Court presided over by Justice Shashank Kumar Singh on Wednesday took exception to the non-compliance of the its order for granting promotion to petitioner Jagendra Prasad Sinha to the super-time scale of the Bihar agriculture service category no. 1 (agronomy).

The court was of the view that despite several adjournments in this case (CWJC No 7918/2002) the court order was not complied with.

It directed the agriculture production commissioner, the director (agriculture), the secretary (finance department) and Bihar Public Service Commission chairman to be present in the court, if the notification regarding promotion of the petitioner to the super-time scale is not issued by Monday. Counsel Mukeshwar Dayal appeared on behalf of the petitioner, while junior counsel to government pleader J D Singh appeared for the state government.

7,'Modi's performance main issue for polls',"HYDERABAD: Performance of the Narendra Modi government would be the main issue in the Gujarat assembly polls, according to BJP national treasurer Ramdas Agarwal.

Listing out the achievements of the BJP government in Gujarat at a press conference on Wednesday, Agarwal claimed that the Modi government had been supplying sixhour uninterrupted power to farmers at a nominal price of 20 paise per unit.

A massive drinking water project was completed in a record time of 700 days to provide water to several hundred villages and both these achievements would win the polls for BJP, he said.

The BJP leader said the Gujarat government had not imposed any fresh taxes during its tenure. Despite natural calamities like earthquake and drought, the government succeeded in maintaining healthy economic growth, he said.

Coming down heavily on the Congress, Ramdas Agarwal said, ""The Congress in Gujarat is in doldrums as it neither has a leader nor an issue to take on the BJP.""

Claiming that BJP under the leadership of Modi could alone save the state from the nefarious designs of Pakistan, he said the people of Gujarat wanted Modi to remain as CM and it was amply reflected in the public response to the Gaurav Yatra.

He condemned the reported statement of Mehbooba Mufti, daughter of Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, that India and Pakistan should not involve in the internal matters of Kashmir.

Asked about chief minister Chandrababu Naidu''s demand for sacking Modi, he advised that Naidu should go to Gujarat and assess the ground situation before making such demands.

State BJP leaders to campaign in Gujarat: The state BJP leaders will campaign for the party in Gujarat to woo the Telugus residing in that state, according to BJP national treasurer Ramdas Agarwal.

Talking to The Times of India,Agarwal said Telugus constitute sizable chunk in places like Kutch, Jamnagar, Baroda, Surat. The names of the leaders would be finalised after consulting the state BJP president C Ramachandra Reddy.

He said the BJP had stopped collecting funds in cash and was only accepting cheques to maintain ""transparency"".

8,Mamata halt to party bickerings,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee cried halt to the squabbling between party leaders Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and Madan Mitra over the termination of contractual workers from the SSKM Hospital.

Worried that the feud would harm the party, she rang up party leaders Partha Chatterjee and Mukul Roy from Delhi on Wednesday and told them to intervene.

While Mitra had openly accused Chattopadhyay of having sided with the contractors over the sacking of the workers, the latter simply fended off the allegations.

The two had even held separate meetings outside the hospital, that lies within Mamata''s parliamentary constituency.

On receiving Mamata''s directive, Chattopadhyay agreed to abide by it, but Mitra refused to budge arguing that being a trade union issue, the party had nothing to do with it.

Meanwhile, new state BJP chief Tathagata Roy will meet party MP Tapan Sikdar in the city on Thursday to iron out their differences over the formation of the new state committee. Roy said the matter would be sorted after a few more meetings, as it was quite ""complicated"".

Though the two had met in Malda on Sunday, there was not much to write home about.

9,More holidays for govt staff,"KOLKATA: Notwithstanding his do-it-now mantra, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in West Bengal has increased the number of public holidays for 2003, much to the delight of the babus both in government and private firms.

The new list of public and government holidays was circulated by Bhattacharjeeâ€™s department of information and culture on Wednesday.

According to it, Bengali New Yearâ€™s Day on April 15 as well as the Pujas will be public holidays. Though government offices remained shut on those days this year, only Dashami was a public holiday.

On public holidays, besides state government offices, other offices are closed, too. Uninterrupted Puja revelry will be permitted from Saptami to Ekadashi next year. The first three days from Saptami will be public holidays under the Negotiable Instruments Act.

However, Republic Day being a Sunday and Gandhiâ€™s birthday coinciding with Saptami, the babus will lose two â€˜genuineâ€™ holidays, rued an employees union leader at Writersâ€™ Buildings.

So, public holidays will go up to 17 from 14 last year while government holidays will be eight instead of seven. Total number of holidays including restricted holidays will remain the same, 32 to be precise, despite the CMâ€™s wishlist to woo the MNCs and domestic investors.

Naturally, the leaders of both the pro-government and anti-government employees unions were happy with the new holidays. However, senior officials were sceptical about Bhattacharjeeâ€™s initiative in promoting work culture and curbing wasteful expenditure.

""District units of the departments and the general administration fax computer print-outs of the attendance of their respective bosses at Writersâ€™ every day. Imagine the kind of money spent on this whole exercise,"" he sighed.

""Now most of the reports claim 98 per cent attendance, obviously fictitious. But who cares? Neither finance minister Asim Dasgupta nor the chief minister bothers to step out of the well-meaning circulars,"" he quipped.

On the austerity front, principal secretary of the department of personnel and administration Dilip Chakraborty admitted that hardly any district had submitted the list of government cars, phones, cellphones and persons using these facilities by November 15, the deadline, as per Dasguptaâ€™s hard-hitting circular.

10,"‘Bureaucracy bridge between govt, people’","BELLARY: Government employees are pillars holding up the democratic set-up. They are the bridge between the government and the electorate, Minister of State for Cooperation M. Diwakar Babu said here on Monday. Their service reflects the governmentâ€™s programmes and developmental works, he added.

Babu was speaking at a programme organised by the Karnataka State Government Employees Association district unit to honour state Union president K. Sippe Gowda at the DCâ€™s compound. Babu said government employees are the agencies through which the government implements its programmes, and any delay or irregularities would have a direct fall-out and a negative impact on the government.

He pleaded with the employees not to misuse their position as this country needs quality service, and they should lead the nation towards progress. â€œServe the nation by responding to the necessities of the people,â€� he urged. â€œPoliticians are temporary and their position is shaky, governments come and go, but the bureaucracy is a permanent body, a mechanism which caters to the people, irrespective of which parties rule.â€�

He warned that the public would not spare errant and irresponsible employees, and would teach them a lesson at the appropriate time. The people-government-bureaucracy chain is interlinked, and dependent on each other to build a strong nation, he remarked.

He also assured that he would look into the genuine demands of the district employees, like a kalyana mantap and sites for them with financial help from Hudco.

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Allum Veerabhadrappa, who was the chief guest, reminded the employees that all of them hailed from ordinary families, and should realise that service to the poor would take them a long way. He appealed to them to rededicate themselves to make Karnataka the most progressive state in the country. He also assured them that a kalyana mantap would soon be built. Allum, who is also the MLA from Kurugodu, announced Rs 1 lakh from the MLAâ€™s grant for the purpose. He said he would try to mobilise more funds for the project.

Earlier, Sippe Gowda was given a grand welcome by the employees at a programme which began two hours behind schedule. Crackers were burst and garlands ordered in large numbers.

K. Gaajanna, general secretary, Bellary District Government Employeesâ€™ Association, welcomed the gathering. Members from the central executive body L. Byrappa, general secretary, Chowdaiah, treasurer, Huchappa, vice-president, and others participated in the â€˜Sippe Gowda Abhinandana Samarambhaâ€™. Executive members also participated.

11,MPs pull up absentee minister Shatrughan,"NEW DELHI: Union health minister and ageing film star Shatrughan Sinha came in for a barrage of criticism for his performance in the government at the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

Sinha is just back from the launch of his new film. His long absences from office have been in sharp contrast to the poor state of healthcare in the country.

Wednesday was his day to answer questions in the House, and they came one after the other on issues like kidney sales, AIDS and chaos in medical institutes.

Some of the MPs remarks were sharp and some offending. Speaker Manohar Joshi had to expunge one by Sunil Khan of the CPM.

Under attack, Sinha, the eternal Bollywood star, was casual and cavalier with practised ease.

Retaliating to Khan''s observation, Sinha bluntly said he did not know him. When some members protested, he said: ""I wish he would not refer to my profession.""

What slid away from the focus was the frightening nature of the problem and the enormity of the challenge in the health sector.

Members referred to a reported case of organs being removed from a person without his knowledge. ""We can take action on the basis of the complaint; if he is referring to a report about kidneys being removed, our inquiry revealed that it was not a kidney but a stone that had been removed,"" Sinha said in a mock serious tone.

Rising to his defence was external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha. ""We all come from different professions, no profession should be denigrated,"" he said.

Replying to CPM member Suresh Kurup''s question about the health ministry''s efforts to stop the illegal trade in human organs, the minister flippantly said to the Chair: ""Yes Sir."" Then he turned to Kurup repeating, ""Yes Sir, I will take the initiative,"" and folded his hands in a namaste.

A C Jose of the Congress said: ""The minister, I must say, is a good actor."" As if on a cue, Sinha responded: ""But I have learnt most of my acting from people like him.""

""The Governor should ask the government to prove its majority, otherwise doubts about his intentions would come into the public mind,"" Singh told reporters on Thursday night. He said it was ironical that the Mayawati government could spend Rs 1,000 crore on Ambedkar Park in Lucknow but not pay the dues of the cane growers, which amounted to only Rs 900 crore. The Dalits and backward classes were sliding away from the BJP, he said adding that there was not a single Dalit amabassador with them. Attacking the economic policies of the Union government, Singh said the country was being pushed into the khud of a economic slavery. The Rs 5,000 crore property of BALCO had been sold for a meagre Rs 5,00 crore, he alleged.

However, the situation was soon brought under control by the police and offences were booked against those involved in the clash, Komar said, adding that there was no tension in the region at all.

Regarding monitoring of ""anti-minority or anti-community"" speeches by any particular candidate in the communally sensitive region, Kumar said, ""Police is keeping a watch on all candidates who are involved in election campaign, irrespective of their party affiliation"".

15,ONGC requests govt to reconsider MRPL investment,"MUMBAI: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has requested the Union finance ministry to reconsider its proposal for investment in the debt ridden Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) avoiding the Public Investment Board route (PIB).

""We have requested the government to reconsider and clear our MRPL investment proposal. In any case, the PIB route does not apply to us as our investment of Rs 59.40 crore is way below the mandatory Rs 200 crore"", ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Subir Raha said here.

He said, moreover, after the AV Birla Group''s exit, MRPL will be a joint venture between two public sector companies, of which the Government of India itself is a party.

Agreeing with Raha''s contention, a senior petroleum ministry official said, ""Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) had already obtained PIB approval when it entered into this joint venture with the Birlas, there is no need for another navratna company to seek approvals for the same project"".

The Union finance ministry has turned down petroleum ministry''s proposal to permit ONGC''s capital infusion in MRPL without going through the PIB to avoid any further delay in closing the deal.

As per the rules, any PSU investment above Rs 200 crore should be ratified by the PIB, the official said.

""But, this will mean that we shall lose time and if the investment does not come through it just might affect MRPL''s financial restructuring"", he added.

Kicking off the party campaign here for the forthcoming Lok Sabha by-election as well as the Assembly polls, Patel told the media there was no need to change the chief minister every time.

When asked whether he was also an aspirant for the chief minister''s post, Patel said, ""There is no question. The Party High Command has already projected Modi as the Chief Minister.""

Referring to the recent militant attack on the Akshardham temple and instances of foreign infiltration into Gujarat, Patel said his government would give a befitting reply to anti-national elements.

The former chief minister said that the Sardar Sarovar Project -- ""the dream of Gujaratis"" -- will be completed soon, resulting in distribution of Narmada water to all parts of Gujarat, as promised.

To a query, he said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has already announced that Godhra would not be made a poll issue.

18,Mufti govt rejects talks with Arun Jaitley,"JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Thursday rejected talks with BJP leader Arun Jaitley, who had held preliminary talks with the ousted Farooq Abdullah government on autonomy and suggested an early resumption of dialogue between the Centre and the elected representatives of the state.

Sayeed brushed aside the autonomy plan saying ""restricting the talks to restoration of autonomy would be like putting the cart before the horse.""

""The Government of India and not Arun Jaitley will talk to us,"" Sayeed said winding up the debate on a motion of thanks to the Governor''s address in the Legislative Council.

He said that going back to the Pre-1953 status for the state as envisaged in the autonomy resolution, which was passed by the previous state Assembly but summarily rejected by the Centre, was neither the plank of the Abdullah government in 1980 nor did it find mention in the Indira Gandhi-Sheikh Abdullah accord of 1975.

The dialogue with the people of Jammu and Kashmir had to be on a ""broader sphere and not on party nominee level,"" the Chief Minister said urging the Centre to give it an early push with the representatives elected to the Assembly in the ""fairest possible transparent"" manner.

Referring to the release of political prisoners, which has come under attack from the Centre, he said that his government had the mandate of the people to deliver and it was not irresponsible.

""This,"" he said, was not done to ""appease"" any section of the people but because he firmly believed in the ""battle of ideas"" in a democratic set up.

Pointing out that JKLF leader Yasin Malik had addressed several public rallies after his recent release, Mufti said that the political process in the state, including even the Hurriyat Conference, would help restore peace and ""make our job easy.""

""Why should we jail our own people?"" he asked, calling for united efforts to put the state on the path of reconstruction and development.

Insisting that the problems in the state had to be tackled politically as use of force generated adverse reaction, he said that even after killing of hundreds of people, including innocents in encounters, the problem could not be tackled.

Suggesting reforms in the police force to make it ""people friendly"" he said, a police commission would be set up.

On disbanding of the controversial Special Operations Group (SOG), he said ""it was being felt that by assisting in the nabbing of one militant, they were creating 10 terrorists.""

SOG''s assimilation with the police force would enable the surrendered militants to get better perks and service conditions, vital for their discipline.

While asserting that he wanted militancy to be tackled firmly, he said that unnecessary harassment of civilians and human rights violations would not be tolerated.

He lauded the role of the Army in defending the borders, but said that it was quite different and difficult for them to handle internal situations.

Sayeed regretted the ""misinformation"" campaign on awarding appointment letters to victims of militancy and clarified that the beneficiaries were those whose dear ones had been killed by militants. He said that such victims from Udhampur district would be provided with jobs at a special function in Udhampur.

However, welfare of families of militants in the form of free education, too, was provided for in the Common Minimum Programme, he said wondering ""Did militants take the permission from their children before taking up arms?""

Favouring friendly relations between India and Pakistan, which he termed a necessity of the compulsions as had happened in the Far East and Europe, Sayeed said that in the globalisation process, the two nations could not afford hostility any longer.

19,Sena to pull up govt over economic issues,"MUMBAI: In an astute political move, the Shiv Sena leader ship has decided to launch a fresh ons laught against the Congress-led DF government on economic issues, despite the party''s bitter political feud with the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party in the coastal district of Sindhudurg.

The Sena''s strategy is to turn the tables on Mr Pawar''s party, which has accused the Sena of having plotted the murder of an NCP activist in Sindhudurg district.

Satyavijay Save of the NCP was killed last Friday in a village near Kankavli, the hometown and political bastion of leader of the opposition Narayan Rane.

The next day, an angry mob set ablaze Mr Rane''s home in Kankavli, setting off a cloud of tension as charges and counter-charges flew thick in the region.

Sena leader Raj Thackeray claimed at a press conference on Thursday that the NCP and the Congress were attempting to divert attention from basic economic issues, which the DF government has failed to tackle.

""The Sena has been holding a series of protest rallies against the DF government and we will go ahead with our anti-DF crusade,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray condemned the murder of Mr Bhise, but added that the Congress and the NCP were trying to gain political mileage out of the murder. Mr Rane said that the fact his house had been ransacked and burnt down was not the point.

""At stake is the credibility of the DF government, which has miserably failed on every front,"" he said. The state is suffering from power and water shortage, and farmers have not been given their dues, he said.

In addition, the state''s industrial scene is dismal, Mr Rane said. He refuted the NCP charge that Mr Bhise''s assassination was plotted by the Sena as revenge for the NCP''s victory in the recent gram panchayat election.

He claimed that Mr Bhise ""had unleashed terror"" in the villages near Kankavli. ""On the night he was done to death he had threatened several villagers, "" Mr Rane said, adding that the Sena was not responsible for the murder.

""An angry mob, fed up with his antics and highhandedness, killed him,"" he claimed. ""The mob even gouged out his eyes after stoning him to death.""

The Sena leader accused NCP state general secretary Gurunath Kulkarni and former MLA Pushpasen Sawant of having led the mob to destroy his Kankavli house, which the NCP has been describing as a ""reaction"" to Mr Bhise''s murder.

""When I came to know that my house has been set aflame I sought assistance from the local police, but to no avail. I put a call to deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal (who is in charge of the home department) but the latter refused to answer my call,"" said Mr Rane.

On Saturday, prominent Sena functionaries, including Uddhav Thackeray, Raj Thackeray and Mr Rane will lead a protest march in Satara. Similar rallies were held in Aurangabad, Pune and Amravati recently.

""The DF government is rattled because of the massive response to these rallies. This explains the DF''s attempts to turn the Bhise murder into an anti-Sena plank,"" Raj Thackeray said.

22,"Hindus observe 'roza', host 'iftar' party","AHMEDABAD: Parshottam Chunara observed ''roza'' on Tuesday. His house is burnt, his employer has turned him away and yet in these difficult times when even a morsel of food seems like a delicacy, Chunara chose to fast for communal harmony.

And, the best part is he was not alone, two other Hindu inhabitants of the riot-devastated Chunaravas area in Vatwa joined their Muslim counterparts from Naroda-Patia in fasting for ''roza''.

Wednesday was a sequel to a programme of communal harmony that was organised by an NGO â€” Kamdar Swastha Suraksha Mandal (KSSM) â€” at Naroda-Patia on Tuesday. Around 50 residents of Chunaravas had been to attend Iftar with residents of Naroda-Patia.

A day later it was the turn of the Naroda-Patia residents to reciprocate. Bhavjibhai Ramanbhai Chunara who also had fasted on Wednesday was all smiles as he greeted guests from Naroda-Patia.

H P Mishra, in-charge of KSSM said: ""Enthusiasm and good response of our peace initiative only proves that not enough is being done to bridge the differences between these two communities. Our experiences have proved that we are on the right track. KSSM along with other like-minded people have pledged to bring communal harmony back to Gujarat.""

""Since the past 16 years I have observed a day-long fast on the 27th day of Ramzan in memory of my father who had breathed his last on that very day. This year I will have fasted two days and my satisfaction has increased manifold for I have become part of a communal harmony project.""

Chunara''s enthusiasm was more than reflected in 15-year-old Moinuddin Ilahibaksh Mansuri''s eyes. Mansuri was at his house in Naroda-Patia when communal frenzy resulted in 86 deaths on February 28.

Riots may have snatched away his family''s only mode of income â€”- a shop in Odhav area â€” and stalled his education midway at standard VII but he has not lost hope.

He is more than willing to attend similar events. He believes, such efforts will help everybody set their lives back on track and more importantly to start attending school again.

Atiq Khan, who resides alongside the Noorani Masjid in Naroda-Patia says: ""I still remember February 28 when hoards of people attacked our locality. I along with my wife and seven-year-old son were lucky to get out alive. Such programmes are welcome but peace initiatives should also be started amidst Hindus and Muslims of Naroda-Patia too.""

Soon it was sundown and Khan along with the 250-odd representing both the communities broke fast along with residents of Chunaravas.

It was after months of gloom and periods of deathly silence, that cheer seemed to have returned to Chunaravas where of the 435 houses 300 were ransacked and broken â€” even doors and windows were pulled out of moorings.

Punji Chunara, a 55-year-old woman residing at Chunaravas, has made three abortive attempts to commit suicide.

Pointing at the gaping holes where the door and windows were, Chunara broke into sobs. Her husband, Atmaram Chunara, who used to be a fruit seller says: ""Ram Rahim is one but unfortunately only we, the poor, seem to know it. I don''t know how at 75 years of age am I going to restart my life.""
