4,Violence: A law exam 'accessory',"lucknow: wednesday's violence was not the first time that lucknow university has borne the wrath of law students. in fact, it has almost become an integral part of law examinations. this has raised pertinent questions as to why law students are so 'lawless'. all this, when the same law department of the university has produced noted lawyers, judges, politicians and even a former chief justice of india — who have protected the indian penal code and the constitution with their landmark judgments. most of the 'credit' for this deterioration goes to the teachers themselves, said a senior law professor on wednesday. a divided faculty involved in petty department politics and subsequent neglect of education — this has been the prime cause for the decline, he added, pleading anonymity. another senior proctorial board member said this slide had been going on for the past 10 years and attributed it to poor quality of admissions. ""for the last ten years, admissions in law courses have been a complete mess. anyone and everyone, after failing in other fields, tends to take admission in law,"" he said and added that most of the student leaders too find the law course 'promising'. ""one can even witness handcuffed students coming in police custody for these examinations,"" he rued. there has been no control in the number of admissions either, he pointed out and added that since large-scale copying is prevalent in admission tests also, so there was no control in quality, he said. another factor is the scarcity of teachers. there are only 14 regular teachers out of a total faculty strength of 40-odd teachers. things are somehow managed with around 11-odd part time teachers. this has resulted in work overload on teachers. students, on the other hand, complain that there are no regular classes and teaching in the law faculty, so copying becomes a compulsion. however, the lu authorities feel that the department would witness a turnaround within a couple of years. following the directives of the bar council of india, the number of seats has been brought down to 300 per class and a semester system has been introduced for the last couple of years.

8,Buddha rules out FBI role,"kolkata: the news that the federal bureau of investigation of the us would help the kolkata police in investigation the terrorist strike outside american center on tuesday caused a flutter in the city during the day. however, west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee was quick to rule out the idea.

""the fbi, too, has sought our co-operation whenever necessary,"" he said. such exchange of co-operation is quite regular, he added. mitra said that the police are yet to identify clearly the assailants who opened fire outside the american center. the police were, however, working on several theories, all of which he refused to disclose. but, he said one of the suspects was amir reza khan, brother of asif reza khan, involved in the roy burman abduction case, who was killed in gujarat. amir, a harkat-ul-ansar activist, had worked in mumbai and was last seen in pakistan. in view of the apparently close link of the american center attack with the roy burman abduction case, in view of the telephone calls received from dubai, the police have decided to interrogate afresh about a dozen people arrested in connection with the abduction and now in custody. one disconcerting revelation was that no regular local criminal was ap-parently present at the scene of shooting at the american center. ""normallly, in case of syndicated crimes, the help of local criminals is taken. in this case, however, no such criminal has been spotted."" the police were reasonably sure, however, that the assailants escaped via middleton street, a few blocks down the jawaharlal nehru road on which the american center is located. a number of eyewitnesses have volunteered information of having spotted motorcycles flying down the road. after the attack.

13,UP polls not a referendum on BJP: Sudarshan,"bangalore: the uttar pradesh elections are not a referendum on the bjp government in the centre, asserted rss chief k.s. sudarshan on friday. speaking to reporters after the inauguration of the three-day samarasata sangama, he said: ``elections come and go and they cannot be a referendum on the government.'' he ruled out ram janmabhoomi being a deciding factor in the elections. ``it is on the bjp's agenda, but it is up to them.'' sudarshan refuted charges that the rss draws the bjp's agenda. ``all organisations in the sangh parivar are separate entities. the bjp draws its own agenda. we are in our 77th year and we have been working honestly and diligently to bring about a renaissance in the country,'' he remarked. on whether the rss is happy with the progress made on the ram temple issue, he said: ``the rss and vhp have always supported the decision taken by the saints, and it is they who are deciding on the matter. the rss has never told the bjp what to do. in any case, it is not a bjp government which is ruling at the centre, but is only a bjp-led government coalition of 25 political parties. naturally, some issues have been put on the backburner.'' the saints have given the government time till march 12 to hand over the non-disputed portion of ram janmabhoomi to build a temple. ``they will be meeting prime minister a.b. vajpayee to discuss the progress and it is for him to convince them on the matter. the pm has said something momentous will happen on that day. the rss will react only after the result of that meeting.'' on the reasons for the pm's delay, sudarshan said: ``we might be on the brink of war with pakistan and the matter might be put on hold, which is a logical explanation. however, everything else is going on normally, so he will have to explain why there has been a delay in handing over the land,'' he contended. on the contentious issue of conversion, sudarshan said: ``it is a violence and denies persons the right to practise their own religion. hindutva is not a religion but a way of life. a hindu is so called because of his location in the geo-political sense. it is a name given to a citizen and those who consider india as their home are all hindus because it recognises unity in diversity.'' sudarshan said the rss allegations that churches in the north east were harbouring terrorists was not just rhetoric. ``in fact a pastor was arrested for possessing arms, ammunitions and explosives. we have instances where citizens have been converted at gun point,'' he added.

14,"Telesonic goes live, Trai rules need tuning","new delhi: the telecom regulator, trai, has cleared the way for bharti telesonic to launch std services from saturday but has applied certain conditions that have left all stake-holders unhappy on some count or the other. some of the conditions are interim measures, however. as for consumers, to choose between telesonic and bsnl, the existing state-owned monopoly std service provider, they will have to dial according to a new numbering plan, which will be longer. they need not worry, however, if they choose to dial the existing way (that is without choosing an operator). for that, trai has recommended that phone operators alternate the default traffic between bsnl and indiaone so that the calls are not lost or dropped. telesonic welcomed the trai decision on friday evening and said that it would go live on saturday. it announced plans last month to launch std services from saturday, january 26, for mobile to mobile callers, under the indiaone brand. trai recommendations have, meanwhile, widened the scope to include basic phone companies as well, although telesonic is yet to finalise technical and commercial details with them. now, trai suggestion on alternating the default traffic has disappointed both bsnl as well as some cellular industry officials, who said that telesonic stood to gain the most from the deal but not them. said bsnl cmd dps seth, â€˜â€˜we are requesting trai to consider the practicality of the recommendations and also whether they are fair. we also believe that making operators choose the std operator for default traffic, instead of the consumers, is against the licensing agreements.â€™â€™ bsnlâ€™s main concerns are centred on loss of 50 per cent of the default traffic that will impact its revenues. besides, it has been asking for time to upgrade its 32,000 exchanges to enable longer digit calling. telesonic, with indiaone as its brand, will be the countryâ€™s first private std operator that would end the monopoly of the state-owned telecom company, bsnl. escotel chief manoj kohli said meanwhile that cellular operators, who have signed up with indiaone as their std carrier, were ready to move traffic on its network. but he had reservations on trai suggestions. cellular operators hoped to get a better revenue share deal from indiaone than they have been getting from bsnl and are not happy at traiâ€™s directing them to divide the traffic, instead of clearing their commercial deal with telesonic. the said they felt â€˜â€˜disincentivisedâ€™â€™ and that a true competition in the std sector has been delayed. kohli said, â€˜â€˜the recommendations, if not corrected soon, will keep the benefits of competition from consumers as well as operators. trai has to play an important role in that direction.â€™â€™

15,"Driven by patriotism, people queue up to buy flags","new delhi: the recent supreme court order permitting the common man to hoist the national flag, but with due care, had people lining up to buy them at the khadi gram udyog bhavan in regal building, connaught place. ''while hundreds of people came throughout the week to buy flags, friday has seen the maximum rush,'' said reena toppo who was manning the flag counter. since the flags come in all sizes (from four-by-six inch to 21-by-14 feet) and the price ranges between rs 35 and rs 7,850, there is one for everyone. ''the sales have almost doubled this year. while last year we sold flags worth rs 15 lakh, this time the sale has touched rs 25 lakh,'' bhavan director karnail singh said. the buyers were equally happy. for tejpal singh, a resident of r k puram's sector-12 and who works in the ministry of textiles as a junior assistant, buying a flag meant giving vent to his patriotic fervour. ''it's the first time we would be hoisting the national flag. the feeling of unfurling the flag and then singing the national anthem will be really great,'' he said. agreed retired wing commander g v kumar who had come to buy the flag for the diwan chand satya pal agarwal x-ray clinic on kasturba gandhi marg where he now works as administration officer. ''hoisting the flag is a very patriotic gesture. it will go a long way in imparting patriotic values to our children,'' the retired airman said. apart from indians, the bhavan also had several foreigners buying the flags. van het kaar, a dutch national who is working on a project in dahej, gujarat, was also in the queue to buy the flag. ''i live in india and work here too. so i thought why not do something very indian like unfurling the national flag,'' he said. however, most of the people this reporter spoke to just had a vague idea about the right way of hoisting the flag. while registering brisk sales, the bhavan is not giving any advise to the buyers on how to hoist them. ''the government is yet to issue an official notification on the way right way a flag must hoisted. once that happens, we will publish the code on one side of the paper and the national anthem and song vande mataram on the other. this note will be given with every flag,'' karnail singh said. the khadi village industries corporation, which runs khadi bhavans all over the country, is the only agency that can produce and sell national flags. it runs about 50 khadi bhavans and bhandars in delhi alone. ''going by the demand this year, we plan to start a bureau of indian standards-certified printing centre in delhi and a cloth fabrication centre in rajasthan. right now the cloth comes from karnataka and the printing is done in mumbai,'' singh said. there is some more good news for those planning to hoist the flags on other occasions. ''within three months we will slash the price of the flags,'' he said.
