0,Two arrested for rape at MLA hostel,"MUMBAI: The social service branch of the city police on Friday arrested a 29-year-old man from Room 608 of Aamdar Nivas, the MLAâ€™s hostel near Mantralaya, for allegedly raping an 18-year-old girl in the hostel on August 8.

Sources said that the accused, Dharmesh Runwal alias Dharma (29), was a personal assistant to an MLA. The police have also arrested a woman, whose name was given as Lakshmi alias Jolly,who claimed to be Runwalâ€™s wife. The police have alleged that Lakshmi was a witness to the rape.

The accused were produced before a metropolitan court on Saturday and were remanded to police custody until November 27. Senior police officers were tight-lipped about the arrests. Zonal deputy commissioner Himanshu Roy told TNN on Saturday night that he was unaware of the rape or subsequent arrests.

Police sources said the victim hailed from West Bengal and was lured to Mumbai by a tout. The latter then allegedly sold her on August 7 to Runwal, who reportedly kept her in the hostel room. He allegedly raped her on August 8. Runwal allegedly allowed the girl to leave the hostel on August 9, but threatened her with dire consequences if she complained to the police.

The girl approached an NGO with whose help she pursued the case with the social service branch. The branch lodged a complaint on November 18 and a team led by senior inspector Subhash Shinde arrested Runwal and Lakshmi late on Friday night.

1,State govt refuses to react on Telgi,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka government on Saturday declined to react to Centreâ€™s decision to hand over the stamp paper racket probe to the CBI.

CM S.M. Krishna has already made his governmentâ€™s stand clear on the issue through a letter to Deputy PM Advani. In the letter, Krishna has commended efforts of the state police, which discovered racketâ€™s kingpin Karim Lala Telgiâ€™s network in other states.

Sources told the Sunday Times of India that the CBI can proceed with the probe, only after obtaining stateâ€™s permission. The other alternative is to obtain an order from the court. â€œEven if it gets permission, the CBI only has to continue the investigation already done and our police have completed the probe.â€�

2,KPTC subsidy for farmers to go up,"NANDAGUDI: The governmentâ€™s subsidy to KPTC for supply of power to farmers will go up by Rs 700 crore â€” from the present Rs 2,300 crore to Rs 3,000 crore â€” this year in view of poor water storage in reservoirs.

Chief minister S.M. Krishna announced this on Saturday at the launch of â€˜Gramajyothiâ€™ project.

The state has experienced 19 per cent deficient rainfall compared to last year. â€œExcept Almatti dam, storage of water in TB, KRS, Hemavathi, Kabini and Linganamakki reservoirs is poor. It will badly hit hydel power generation,â€™â€™ he added.

There are over 68 lakh farmers with 16 lakh irrigation pump (IP) sets in operation. The government has earmarked Rs 2,300 crore as subsidy for KPTC in this yearâ€™s budget.

The â€˜Gramajyothiâ€™ project aims at providing uninterrupted power supply to rural domestic consumers.

The CM urged farmers not to give up hope.

â€œWhatever might be the cost of power procurement, subsidised power has to be supplied to farmers. All of us are facing natureâ€™s fury in the form of third consecutive drought. We can always look forward to good times ahead.â€™â€™

3,Govt dithers on helmet rule,"BANGALORE: Though the Karnataka High Court had set the January deadline for the government to make helmet-wearing mandatory for two-wheeler riders, including pillion, the latter does not seem to show the same spirit in implementing it. Bureaucratic delay is playing spoilsport.

It was on November 4 that the court issued the direction. More than 15 days have passed by, but the government is yet to begin the exercise of amending Karnataka Motor Vehicle (KMV) Rules 1989, in this connection.

â€œAny amendment requires over 30 days. It involves various stages â€” issuing notification, calling for public objection and reviewing them and making the final notification of the amendment. There is hardly any time left,â€™â€™ transport department sources told Sunday Times of India. â€œSince it is a matter of public safety, the government just cannot ignore it anymore. The court has given sufficient time to effect the amendment. The process should have commenced by now.â€™â€™

Transport department officials blame higher authorities for the delay. â€œEven before the court issued directions, the department submitted a proposal to the government to reintroduce helmet rule. It is unfortunate the issue is being dragged around,â€™â€™ they rued.

The amendment pertains to KMV Rule 230, which is violative of Section 129 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (enacted by the Centre). As per Rule 230, owners of two-wheelers with more than 11 metric brake horse power (BHP) capacity have to wear helmets.

However, the capacity of a large number of two-wheelers is less than 11 metric BHP. Consequently, riders were given exemption. A PIL was filed against this exemption, under KMV Rule 220, and an amendment sought.

Officials also feel the issue might assume political overtones next year when elections to Parliament and Assembly are due. Also, the government is yet to finalise several aspects relating to the helmet rule. â€œThere is an argument in favour of exempting pillion from wearing helmet. No doubt, itâ€™s a time-consuming process. But the government is showing no urgency,â€™â€™ sources observed.

4,Antony attend Karunakaran's Iftar party,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: At loggerheads over supremacy in Congress in Kerala, an Iftar party hosted by senior party leader K Karunakaran brought him under one roof with his bitter rival Chief Minister A K Antony here on Friday evening.

Antony, who made a brief appearance at the venue, left early while other leaders stayed on.

When journalists crowded around Karunakaran readying to shoot questions, the senior leader said: ""I am sure journalists here are sensible enough not to ask political questions on an occasion like this.""

""All I want to say is that God is supreme and extend my Ramzan greetings to everyone,"" he said.

Karunakaran, heading the I faction, has vowed to bring down the Antony Government by Nov 25.

The presence of Leader of the Opposition in the assembly V S Achuthanandan, Deputy leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, CPI-M state Secretary Pinarayi Vijayan and LDF convenor Paloli Mohammed Kutty evoked interest in the wake of reported new-found bonhomie between the I faction and the CPI-M.

5,CVC denies naming ministers in PSU row,"NEW DELHI/BHOPAL: In the midst of raging controversy over his meeting with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Chief Vigilance Commissioner P Shankar on Saturday said he had not named any minister as having ""milked"" Public Sector Undertakings.

Denying news reports that he named six ministers, including commerce minister Arun Jaitley and petroleum minister Ram Naik, who allegedly sought money from PSUs under their charge, he said that going by the reputation of ministers like Jaitley, nothing could be said against them.

""The reports that I have named ministers, especially commerce minister Arun Jaitley and petroleum minister Ram Naik are wild, baseless and totally absurd. No names were taken,"" Shankar said.

He said he had worked under Naik and he will not make such a complaint against him.

Shankar said he had hoped that the issue will die down after the Prime Minister himself made a statement about it last week. He added that the fact that it was being discussed even now was unfortunate.

The CVC said when he had met the PM, he had gone to have a general discussion on Vigilance matters and clear the air about the investigations over which there were some misgivings. The discussion included subjects like the decision-making in PSUs, interference and autonomy for executives.

""We want to bring about corporate governance in PSUs,"" Shankar said, adding the issue of executives seeking a level playing field was also discussed.

""I am not a Lokpal or Lokayukt to complain about people. I donâ€™t have the authority to go into such things,"" he said.

Later talking to reporters in Chennai, Shankar described the reports that he had complained to the Prime Minister about six ministers as ""rumours"".

""I have not made any complaints orally or in writing to the Prime Minister,"" he said. He said the reports were a ""total lie"". ""I do not know why such rumours and canards are being spread,"" Shankar said. ""Our job is to monitor the functioning of all the departments and not to lodge complaints,"" he said.

In Bhopal, Jaitley reacted sharply to the CVCâ€™s statement. He asked the Congress to send an apology to President A P J Abdul Kalam and the people of the country. Jaitley alleged that the Congress had ""lied"" to the President and betrayed his trust.

""The Congress lied to the President and the country and the lie lasted only for a few hours,"" Jaitley said.

""The party should apologise to the President. Just because the President has given a political party an appointment, they misused it and put a serious question on the trust of the President.""

6,"Man steals bikes to impress girl, arrested","HYDERABAD: The Marredpally police on Friday arrested a school dropout who used to steal motorcycles for extra cash to impress his girl friend.

The arrested person has been identified as Y Anji Reddy, 19. He was working as a car driver at Marredpally. A native of Maddimadugu village in Anantapur district, Anji Reddy dropped out of school after he failed his SSC exams. He came to Hyderabad a couple of years ago in search of work, police said.

He had been working as a driver and during his leisure time used to watch college girls in the locality. Subsequently, he fell in love with an intermediate girl, said to be a native of Vijayawada, sub-inspector of Marredpally police station S Krishna Murthy told The Times of India.

However, he was under the impression that girls would be impressed only by a lavish lifestyle. To win over the girl, he started stealing motorcycles. The young man used to look for motor-cycles which were not locked and rolled them some distance. Then, he used to start the stolen two-wheeler sets of duplicate keys, he said. Anji Reddy had stolen three motorcycles and had pledged two of them for money.

He was held on Friday while riding the third motorcycle stolen from West Marredpally four days ago, the SI said. The accused could not win over the girl in spite of his efforts, police said. And in the process, he landed in jail. Subsequently, all the three stolen two-wheelers were recovered and the accused was sent to judicial custody, police added.

7,Seven-fold increase in Aids cases,"HYDERABAD: Signalling an unbridled spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Aids) in the state, a recent survey has revealed that the number of HIV positive cases reported in Andhra Pradesh has gone up by over seven times.

From 612 in March 2001, the number of reported HIV positive cases have gone up to 4339 in August 2003, reveals a survey jointly done by Population Reference Bureau (PRB) and Population Foundation of India (PFI). The study findings assume significance as the number of reported cases represents only a fraction of the actual prevalence.

Though National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has already classified Andhra Pradesh as a â€˜high prevalenceâ€™ state, the latest study clearly states that Aids has assumed epidemic proportions in the state. This is substantiated by the fact that, in certain districts as many as four out of every hundred women admitted to ante-natal clinics have tested positive for the disease. â€œThis is an extremely high prevalence for general population, especially as these mothers can pass on the disease to the newborns,â€� PFI executive director A R Nanda said.

The sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the state, which monitor the prevalence among high-risk population, are also witnessing a spurt in the number of HIV positive cases. The STD clinic in Tirupati topped the chart with forty out of hundred patients testing positive for the disease.

Among the significant contributing factors is the lack of awareness about the disease as well as about measures to prevent AIDS from spreading. As per the Naco figures, nearly 30 per cent of the urban population and nearly 40 per cent of rural population is not aware of condoms as a means to prevent AIDS.

The study highlighted the need for raising awareness and free distribution of anti-retroviral drugs for those already affected. Asked about measures to increase awareness, AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) joint director M V Ramana Rao said that the society has already started awareness campaigns in schools and colleges on priority basis. The study also emphasised the need for establishing more confidential testing centres in every district.

8,Council polls: Cong lodges protest with CEC,"LUCKNOW: The UP Congress Party has lodged a formal complaint with the Chief Election Commissioner, alleging several gross instances of violation of the moral code of conduct on the part of some ministers in the Mulayam Singh Yadav ministry in the coming council polls.

President of the state Congress committee Jagdambika Pal has, in a letter addressed to the CEC as well as the chief election officer UP, levelled serious accusations against the state government with an urgent plea to intervene.

The activities of ministers, Pal has alleged, have ""violated all established tenets of justice and morality and also breached the constitutional provisions"". The ministers, according to the complaint, ""have been terrorising voters, including BDC members, and also trying to buy them off"".

Those refusing to toe the line, he has further alleged, are being transferred out in a blatant disregard of the moral code of conduct. Pal has particularly cited the instance of the recently transferred chief medical officer of Behraich to press the point.

The Congress state chief has also registered his protest against ""official vehicles with red beacons which have been touring the Basti and Gonda districts in a bid to influence voters"".

The situation, due to fear and pressure tactics, he has written, has become sensitive and tense, leading to reasonable apprehension of booth capturing in the minds of Congress candidates.

Pal has requested the CEC to put an end to the objectionable activities of ministers so that a repeat of Badaun episode is prevented.

9,Kids lead fight against domestic violence,"NEW DELHI: Fifty per cent of Indian households witness scenes of violence against women, including husbands beating up their wives, everyday.

According to a United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) report, ""Say No to Gender-based Violence"", instances of domestic violence are as high as 50 per cent in India. In Pakistan, such incidents happen in 80 per cent households.

Blaming the government for not taking action aga-inst the perpetrators of the crime, the report says: ""It has been perceived by lawmakers to be a private matter that must be left alone.""

To draw people''s attention to this problem, UNIFEM will be starting a 16-day campaign against gender-based violence, starting from November 25.

According to Chandni Joshi, regional programme director, UNIFEM, the campaign will take a different approach: Schoolchildren will tell the adults that any form of violence against women is bad.

10,George calls for law on baseless allegations,"BHOPAL: Close on the heels of Dilip Singh Judeo''s exit from the government following the cash-on-camera scam, Defence Minister George Fernandes Sunday called for an effective law to deal with such cases saying anybody can now become a â€˜victimâ€™ in the absence of a legal framework.

""We don''t have a law to deal with these (Judeo like episode). There has to be a law which takes care of such things,"" Fernandes told reporters here.

He said those in journalism could also ""fall victim to news"" in the absence of a legal mechanism.

Fernandes said now anybody can come out with claims as in Judeo''s case on the eve of elections as there was no regulatory arrangement.

11,BJP demands CBI probe on Marad incident,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP Kerala unit today demanded the state government to take immediate steps to order CBI investigation into the May 2 Marad violence which claimed nine lives.

Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, party state president P S Sreedharan Pillai said the government was ''delaying'' the order for the CBI probe even though a decision in this regard was taken by the Cabinet nearly two months before.

He said the government''s justification that it was waiting for legal opinion on the matter was unsatisfactory.

The CBI probe into the incident was one of the agreements that paved the way for rehabilitation of displaced minority families from the area.

The party would chart out further course of action in support of their demand after getting the government''s reply, he said, adding BJP would explore legal and democratic ways to achieve its objective.

Referring to Dec 1 Thiruvalla Assembly by-poll, he alleged ruling UDF was misusing government machinery.

So what if they are not the â€˜real thingâ€™.Supporters of chief minister Ajit Jogi have already engaged troupes of folk dancers to canvass for the Congress at Marwahi. Huge consignments of dholaks, harmonium and cricket bats have been dispatched to the town from Raipur.Dance troupes of much sought after Dilip Laheriya and Rajni Rajak are also moving in for the kill.

13,SAD-BJP protest against Badal chargesheet,"CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal workers staged blockades throughout Punjab disrupting traffic on highways to protest filing of chargesheet against their chief Parkash Singh Badal, amidst tight security arrangements.

Official sources said no untoward incident was reported during the four-hour blockade which began at 11 am even as SAD claimed its cadre was lathicharged at some places.

""Party workers have brought road traffic to a halt in Punjab to protest filing of the chargesheet,"" a SAD release said.

SGPC President G S Tohra joined the protestors at different places charging the Amarinder Singh led Congress government of having adopted a policy of vendetta against the SAD workers.

A number of marriage parties reached their destinations late due to road blockades.

Major roads wore a deserted look as the police diverted traffic through rural roads. Despite this a number of vehicles, including buses, were stranded at many places due to the blockade, reports here said.

A SAD release claimed that Akali Dal workers were lathi charged at Baba Bakala on Amritsar-Jalandhar Road as the police tried to remove the peaceful protestors.

14,Talking of '84 riots,"NEW DELHI: Sardar Sarabjeet Singh, BJP-Akali Dalâ€™s candidate from Rajouri Garden does not need an issue to campaign for election â€” he is the issue. Singh has been given the ticket to fight transport minister Ajay Maken, simply to evoke memories of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Singh lost 8 members of his family in the riots.

Much water has flown under the bridge since then, Singh is now a successful businessman and film producer. A political novice, he is nevertheless determined to give Maken a run for his money.

As he sets out from his Vishal Enclave residence every morning, surprisingly many auto drivers park their vehicles outside his house. â€˜â€˜We campaign for Sardarji, Maken has driven us out of business, do you know that this is the third CNG kit I have installed in my vehicle?â€™â€™ says Mahinder Singh, an auto rickshaw driver.

â€˜â€˜I am a businessman, who strayed into politics, I understand their problems,â€™â€™ says Sarabjeet Singh. As he walks on, he is told by his supporters that the police has removed banners and posters put up by him in Raghuvir Nagar. â€˜â€˜They havenâ€™t touched the Congress posters,â€™â€™ says on of his supporters.

As Singh starts to call people, he wonders aloud as to why BJP flags were removed, after all the police is under the central NDA government. Old ladies, who have seen him grow give him their blessings. â€˜â€˜He came here as an orphan, to live with his bua, after his family was killed,â€™â€™ says Rajinder Kaur.

Is it enough though to see him through in the elections? Contrary to popular belief, the area is not dominated by Sikhs but by Punjabi Hindus. â€˜â€˜Whoever they are, all agree that an injustice was done in 1984, every anniversary of Indira Gandhiâ€™s death reinforces it,â€™â€™ Singh says. Singh is hoping the memories translate into votes as well.

15,"Dishonest, lawless: Our cops need policing","NEW DELHI: In August this year, the of Delhi Police received a complaint from a physically challenged social activist, who said that he was assaulted by cops inside the Anand Parbat police station after he had alleged that they were acting in cahoots with local criminals.

The complainant went on to describe how the cops had tried to falsely implicate him in a case of sexual harassment.

In an upmarket colony in southwest Delhi, some policemen barged into the residence of a school teacher at night, after they found her daughter talking to a friend just outside the house, and branded them both prostitutes. The boy was taken to the local police station and was released only after he had shelled out whatever money he was carrying.

In another incident, a constable shot dead a truck driver with his service rifle after an argument.

â€˜â€˜Corruption, indiscipline and abuse of authority are the main charges,â€™â€™ said a senior police officer. More than 1500 cases of beating up people, about 300 of extortion, and about 800 cases of illegal detention and arrests have been registered against policemen this year.

Joint commissioner of police (vigilance) Kanwaljeet Singh Deol said that the vigilance department is maintaining a â€˜â€˜doubtful integrityâ€™â€™ list comprising names of officers and other staff under the scanner. â€˜â€˜These include those against whom there are serious allegations. They are being closely monitored and are denied promotion and transfers of their choice,â€™â€™ she said.

â€˜â€˜A policeman believes he has all the freedom in the world. He is under the imp-ression that he can get away with anything,â€™â€™ says psychiatrist Jitender Nagpal.

But are all policemen purveyors of evil, guided only by money? If the top brass is to be believed, the answer is no. Deputy commissioner of police (crime), Dependra Pathak, cites the example of constable Surinder Singh, who endangered his own life to save that of two drowning.

A resident of Noida, Krishan Warikoo, lost a relative and his child in an accident in Alipur in June this year. The family, returning from a wedding, had jewellery and cash on them. They were all unconscious when sub inspector Naresh Kumar took them to a hospital. Days later, Kumar went back and handed over the jewellery and cash. In a letter to Delhi Police, Warikoo wrote his family was â€˜â€˜speechlessâ€™â€™ and couldnâ€™t believe such a soul still exists.â€™â€™

There are others like Kunju, who proved to be Sushil Sharmaâ€™s nemesis in the Tandoor case. Kunju refused to turn hostile even though he was offered Rs 10 lakh.

Sadly for the police though, these exceptions only prove the rule.

There is near unanimity among policemen that the buck stops right at the top as far as corruption is concerned. A senior officer cites the example of the additional SHO of Paschim Vihar, who was arrested by the CBI for possessing wealth disproportionate to his income. â€˜â€˜He said that he had paid a huge amount to become additional SHO and that he was only making up for it. Itâ€™s easy to blame the cop on the street for extorting money, but it has to be ascertained why he behaves like that,â€™â€™ said the officer.

According to Nagpal the media has also done its bit to exacerbate the imageâ€” or the lack of it. â€˜â€˜Movies portray policemen as gun-toting mercenaries. The general impression is that they are corrupt, even though some of them are indeed doing a very good job under trying circumstances,â€™â€™ says Nagpal.

16,No incentive for good work,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police constable starts working at a basic salary of Rs 3,050. He gets a house rent allowance that is 30 per cent of the basic salary. In all, he draws a little over Rs 6,000 which includes a conveyance allowance of a mere Rs 30.

According to the rank and file of Delhi Police, gruelling work conditions, coupled with lack of incentive has ensured that policemen today are a largely indifferent lot.

â€˜â€˜On paper, we have to work just for 8 hours a day. The nature of job, however, is such that every constable puts in 14 hours of service a day on an average. We have authorised leaves, but even that is conditional,â€™â€™ said constable Balbir Singh.

For many, police behaviour on the streets is just a manifestation of the frustration and hopelessness in a police constableâ€™s mind. â€˜â€˜For any system to work efficiently, reforms have to take place. Without any emoluments or incentive, a cop will try and look for other avenues to vent his frustration. Itâ€™s sad as the police accountability to the public is perhaps even more than the Armyâ€™s,â€™â€™ says psychologist Jitender Nagpal.

For an average policeman cash rewards for good work are meagre. A DCP can give a cash reward of not more than Rs 500. Even that, many allege, is open to manipulation.

A constable needs to put in a minimum of six years of service to be eligible for the test to become a head constable.

However, itâ€™s very rarely that a constable clears the examination in one go as he simply doesnâ€™t have the time to study for it.

Once a constable is 40, he can be promoted to a head constable if he has an outstanding service record. The selection is not immune to favouritism either.

17,1 in 3 trucks violate SC orders in city,"NEW DELHI: One in three trucks on Delhi roads are suspected to be running in violation of a Supreme Court order which bans entry of trucks that are not carrying goods for the city.

The result: About 295 people died in the city in 2002 in accidents involving trucks and another 267 died till October 31, this year.

R K Parimoo, director, Institute of Driving Training and Research (IDTR), says, â€˜â€˜Most truck-drivers are ill-trained.â€�

â€œThough 50 per cent of the 80,000 drivers trained from the institute every year are truck drivers, the number of people actually driving heavy commercial vehicles in Delhi is much more,â€™â€™ he added.

The NCR has about 3.5 lakh registered commercial vehicle drivers. Many more come from outside.

Predictably, all agencies that are supposed to restrict the entry of these trucks into the city are passing the buck.

A S Kaushik, enforcement officer, transport, said, â€˜â€˜It was decided a year back that the Delhi Police will be responsible for checking the entry of transit vehicles.â€™â€™

However, the joint commissioner of police (traffic), Qamar Ahmed, said, â€˜â€˜The government gave us the responsibility without bothering to provide us with enough staff. Where do we get that many men to ensure adequate night deployment?â€™â€™
