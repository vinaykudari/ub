0,New science policy soon,"pune: union human resources development (hrd) minister murli manohar joshi on saturday said the draft of the new national science policy seeks to revive science as a subject, and its practical use. speaking to reporters after the 13th convocation ceremony of the tilak maharashtra vidyapeeth, joshi said the draft was nearly complete and will now be presented to a group of ministers for recommendations. the salient features of the proposed policy, he said were funding and teaching of science, which are dealt with at great length. the draft has considered the various options available for funding of science at different levels, he added. the minister said the draft has also deliberated upon issues like taking science to the backward classes, removing poverty and bridging the digital divide. the new policy also has a chapter dedicated to use of science as a tool for generation of employment. while fielding questions on the political front, however, joshi chose to play safe. about the stand-off over the ayodhya issue between vishwa hindu parishad and the bjp-led coalition at the centre, joshi said, i think the issue should be solved by consensus, he said. when specifically asked if he was in agreement with party president jana krishnamurthy in accepting a court verdict over the temple issue, joshi replied ambiguously again: there should be consensus even on the court verdict.

1,No pact with anyone in UP polls: Arjun,"patna: the congress is not aware of any decision of the rjd to support its candidates for 41 seats in the up assembly elections, said all india congress committee (aicc) member arjun singh here on sunday. he said even the congress spokesman has not given any such indication that the party would have alliance with anyone in the forthcoming elections. singh was reacting to the unilateral announcement of rjd chief laloo prasad yadav that the latter's party would support congress candidates, specially in eastern up. ""laloo se kya kisi se koi alliance nahin hai up mein,"" singh said, adding that it would be very difficult for him to speak at the moment about ""post-poll alliance"". he, however, maintained that the congress stand on up would certainly not affect the party's relations with the rjd in bihar and that the congress would continue its support to the rjd. the aicc member said that the congress is going to the polls on the issue of ""development"" of up and that it would play a decisive role in the formation of government there. there is no law and order worth the name in up, he observed. as to the congress prospects in the punjab and uttaranchal assembly elections, he said, ""the party is hopeful in these two states."" singh along with other senior congress leader p shivshankar was on a day's visit to the state. they had come to attend the rehmani madarsa conference in munger on the directive of aicc president sonia gandhi. singh said a dangerous trend has been set by different political parties which came to the fore during the distribution of tickets to candidates for assembly elections in four states. apart from caste and community, even gotra has now come to play an important role in selection of the candidates. such a trend must be checked as otherwise it would prove very dangerous for the indian democracy, he remarked. talking about the rss raking up the ayodhya issue at the time of elections, singh said new political terms ""back burner"" and ""front burner"" have emerged in the country. he accused the bjp of having double face on the ayodhya issue, saying that on one hand it incites the rss from behind while on the other it speaks otherwise for public consumption. he said after the december 13 attack on parliament, the congress had decided to give ""broad-based support"" to the nda government at the centre but the bjp has now started playing politics. ""hum support de rahe hain, par government politics kar rahi hai,"" he maintained. referring to congress mp rajo singh who is absconding in connection with the sheikhpura carnage case, arjun singh said the law of the land must take its course.

6,Cabinet to discuss VRS for govt employees,"new delhi: the union cabinet is likely to discuss on tuesday introduction of voluntary retirement scheme (vrs) in virtually all ministries as recommended by the expenditure reforms commission (erc) and consider a proposal on modalities of freeing petroleum sector from price controls. reform initiatives in other sectors such as fertiliser, agriculture, drug and department of personnel are also expected to figure in the meeting, official sources said. as part of oil sector decontrol, pricing of controlled products- petrol, diesel, kerosene and cooking gas (lpg)- is to be freed from april one, 2002 and on tuesday the council of ministers would deliberate on the modalities of doing that. while import parity price is proposed to be given to the controlled products and domestic crude oil, subsidies on kerosene and lpg are to be brought down to 33.3 and 15 per cent respectively. among the more controversial ministries in which downsizing is likely to be discussed is the information and broadcasting ministry in which the erc had suggested shutting down of several media units including the davp, directorate of film festivals, films division, directorate of field publicity and song and drama division. the suggestions of the erc, if implemented, would result in the total staff strength of the ministry and organisations under it including prasar bharti being reduced from 7779 posts to 2176 posts. the i&b minister sushma swaraj has said that she is for rightsizing instead of downsizing as most media units have their relevance even today. the erc had suggested restructuring of virtually all the ministries barring the railways ministry. in its suggestions the commission had mooted offering vrs to staff moved to the surplus pool from the various ministries from posts which have been declared redundant. the erc had also suggested an improvement in the vrs to 35 days for every year of service and 25 days for every year of service remaining over an earlier suggestion of restricting vrs to only 45 days for every year of service put. suggestions of the erc to downsize the government have already begun to be implemented since 1999 with government restricting its recruitment to one per cent as against three per cent of the staff retiring annually to attain a target of reducing central employees by 10 lakh in a five year period. among the reform initiatives expected to be discussed is the proposed long-term fertiliser policy which seeks to completely decontrol the fertiliser sector, wherein urea is the only controlled nutrient at present, in a phased manner. in the 2001-02 union budget, the government had stated that it would implement the recommendations of the erc to replace the unit-wise retention price system (rps) for urea by group-wise mechanism. the much-awaited drug policy seeking to reduce the span of price control is also expected to be discussed in the meeting. related stories:

7,`Politics should be kept away from development',"thiruvananthapuram: dr m s valiyathan, chairman of the kerala state committee on science, technology and environment, on monday said politics should be kept away from developmental activities as was done by former chief minister c achutha menon during the 70s. speaking at a meet-the-press programme of the kesari memorial journalists' trust, he said the present government too should have taken such a bold decision. he said basic research or blue sky research in scientific parlance should be done in educational institutions like universities and not in institutions of greater responsibility. valiyathan said patenting had become a problem but there was nothing to worry if we were vigilant about our needs.

8,Octroi income improves,"ahmedabad: despite a severe staff shortage in the department, the civic body's octroi income in january at rs 26.63 crore showed a marginal jump of rs 1.27 crore compared to january 2001. this is regarded by officials as an indication that the city has come out of the quake shock. ""since last year octroi collections have been dipping, more so after the earthquake. this jump of over a crore is a positive indication. despite exempting petrol and diesel products from octroi as per state government norm, we hope to achieve the annual target of rs 325 crore,"" said kishansinh tomar, chairman of the octroi committee. tomar's enthusiasm is understandable as in april 2001 the collection deficit as compared to 2000-2001 was rs 19 crore. now the difference is down to rs 8.39 crore. ""with our monthly octroi collection hovering around rs 27 crore we are well on target,"" added tomar. the octroi department is, however, plagued with a shortage in staff with 299 posts lying vacant. officials refer to the number of 1,273 sanctioned posts and talk of the need for senior and junior valuation officers, senior and junior clerks and others. tomar added, ""i have sought an increase in manpower in my department that is in all practicality the financial backbone of amc. that apart if my proposals for rs 10 crore per annum (in lieu of octroi duty waiver on petrol and diesel) and for octroi rate revision, that would increase amc's income by rs 15 crore annually, are okayed by the gujarat government then the civic body would regain its cash-rich status.""

9,No staff to keep an eye on rallyists in Rann,"ahmedabad: the forest department, which refused permission to a car-rally in the wild ass sanctuary in the little rann of kutch, has no staff to look after the rallyists entering the rann, even as 'tourists'. with as few as 13 beat-guards, half a dozen foresters and a dozen-odd administrative staff, to protect a mammoth five thousand sq km of area and monitor a rally too, is going to be a herculean task. each guard walks up to eight km a day in the rann, to check on encroachers and unauthorised entrants. in effect, there is no monitoring of the protected area. moreover, these guards have been asked since january to check on tourists at all the hotels, safaris and resorts on the fringes, every morning. this leaves the rann unmonitored. this is despite the fact that indian wild ass is a sub-species protected under schedule-i of the wildlife protection act and the wild ass sanctuary is the only habitat of theirs. former union environment minister digvijaysinh zala, who was instrumental in getting the rann declared a protected area shares the concern. ""if not permanent then temporarily, but it certainly will disturb the wildlife. why can't the organisers think of alternatives?"" he says. zala suggests tracts between santalpur to suigam or the rann in the north of the santalpur, or between santalpur to bela and khadir 'beyts'. but considering the tension on the international border, the organisers don't see any possibility of organising a rally there and express commitment to the cause of conservation. ""this is not a race, but a rally where one vehicle will be flagged off every five minutes. participants will not be drive beyond cruising speed of 50 km as they get 10 penalties for reaching one minute earlier, but get only one penalty for being late. so no one will want to speed,"" explains wing commander vijay karnik of the gujarat motosports association of vadodara. the instructions sent by the state government on january 31, directed the local staff ""to charge all the fees as per section 28 and enter the rann"" and asked the guides ""to ensure that the cars are being driven under the fixed speed limit."" going by the books, every vehicle will have to drive at a speed below 20 km per hour. exceeding this speed can invite penalty of up to rs 5,000. but there is no one to ensure this, monitor situation and fine the violators, as the 13 beat-guards are spread all over the length and breadth over hundreds of sq km. surprisingly, there are no printed receipts with the forest department for issuing to the visitors! currently receipts printed for carrying goods or 'maal' are given to the visitors.

10,BJP stages midnight protest for better Hubli roads,"hubli: smooth and motorable roads for the people of hubli-dharwad have become a luxury. when the state government earmarked rs 2 crore recently for taking up road repair projects, it was assumed that goods roads in hubli-dharwad would be a reality. ``but it's not so,'' says bjp leader rangabaddi, who staged a demonstration at midnight on sunday on koppikar road against the quality of the material used for the repair works. the protest brought the ongoing asphalting work to a halt. baddi said that the work is not being taken up in accordance with the specification. ``we will not allow further work on this road unless quality is maintained,'' he said. the state government had arranged a package of rs 2 crore from hudco for taking up five important road repair projects. the water board was identified as the agency to take up the work and the hdmc was included in the scheme as a supervising body. the irony is that though the hdmc does not have a role to play in the execution of this road project, it is the civic body which has to repay the loan amount with interest, baddi said. he added that there was no point in allowing the work on koppikar road as the asphalting is not according to the specification. according to him, ``the asphalting should be at least 70-mm in thickness, but that is not followed by the contractor.'' ``it is tax payers' money which is getting wasted on such projects,'' he rued.however, he agreed that the quality of the work on the club road was according to the specifications. in fact, when the fund was sanctioned, the hdmc had witnessed a heated debate as the corporators protested the council's non-participation in the project. the hdmc wrote to the government that the civic body should have the supervisory role as loan repayment was its liability.

11,"Kumar Bangarappa defends govt, father","gulbarga: minister of state for minor irrigation kumar bangarappa found himself on a sticky wicket on sunday when a poser about the vishwa scheme launched by his father was hurled at him. he played in defence of his father as well as s.m. krishna in whose team he is now a junior minister. when specifically asked about the statement of s. bangarappa who had expressed misgivings that the present government was not assiduously pursuing the vishwa scheme launched by him as chief minister about a decade ago, kumar bangarappa said his father's statement ``was only intended to ask the government to give more attention to implementing the vishwa scheme as it helps rural people become self-reliant''. the minister conceded that the implementation of the scheme by the krishna government is tardy. he, however, was quick to add that other schemes like ashraya and aradhana, launched by s. bangarappa as chief minister, are being given ``much importance by this government''.

12,"Scarred for life, he awaits govt dole","ahmedabad: help reaches last to those who require it the most. this principle of lop-sided justice is epitomised in the case of 50-year-old jakrabhai of bhachau who sustained one of the most frightening injuries in the january 26 earthquake but still waits in vain for a disability compensation. one eye is all that remains on the badly mutilated surface that was once jakrabhai's face. as the wall of his house collapsed on his back, he was pushed into an iron-grate with burning coals where his forehead, cheeks, lips and nose melted in a matter of seconds, leaving him with a grotesque disfigurement. jakrabhai has practically remained incarcerated in the burns ward of the civil hospital with his face totally swathed in bandages since the last one year. he has undergone a series of reconstructive surgeries in the past 12 months and will continue to do so for the next three years, but the fact is that his disability is 100 per cent. but apparently his misery is not enough to prompt government officials to release his disability compensation of rs 50,000. ""i've not got any help so far,"" mumbles jakrabhai like a robot from between a bagful of skin-flaps attached on his mouth that will be surgically be sculpted into lips later on. jakrabhai's son pravin claims that the family has submitted the 100 per cent disability certificate with the ddo, but the person concerned is fighting shy to sign the release order for the compensation. ""there's one mr saiyad whose signature is all that is required to release the money but he says we had filled in the application late and now he can't sign it and the same will have to be represented to the state government. when we asked him to return the certificate so that we could personally present our case to the government, he didn't cooperate. we don't really understand what's happening,"" says pravin, who has had to leave his job in a computer-stationery shop in mumbai to be at his ailing father's side ever since the tragedy struck. needless to say, the family is under great financial strain and has been forced to meet ends by borrowing money from family, friends and money-lenders. ""all kind of relief from the government has curiously bypassed our family. the doctors here are like gods who are giving me free treatment but the shuttling between bhachau and ahmedabad and living expenses incurred at the hospital are becoming difficult to bear with no source of income,"" confides jakrabhai. he is also worried about his daughter's impending marriage that was slated on january 28, 2001, but had to be postponed to this year. interestingly, jakrabhai was supposed to have come to ahmedabad this january 26, but he chose to forego his treatment for a while. ""there were rumours of an impending quake on january 26. i chose to remain in bhachau because there's nothing left to fall ... i live in a tent. here, the civil hospital might have crumbling down. i didn't want to take any risk,"" he adds.

13,Municipal election fever grips Nagpur,"nagpur:after an initial dull and listless campaign, the poll fever has gripped the second capital of maharashtra for the next sunday's election for 136 seats from 45 zones for the nagpur municipal corporation (nmc). the campaign has started picking up momentum with padyatras, public meetings and doorto-door contacts by the enthusiastic candidates with voters all around the city. nearly 13 lakh voters will exercise their franchise this time to pick up 136 corporators from among 1,074 candidates in the fray for nmc polls, according to official sources. the bjp-ruled nmc was earlier dissolved by the state government but restored by a high court bench. the congress has fielded a maximum number of 133 nominees followed by the bjp with 131, ncp 119, shiv sena 10 and bahujan samaj party 67 and others. the ncp has struck an alliance with the republican parties headed by mp ramdas athwale and former mp jogendra kawade, along with the local outfit lokmanch headed by former mayor atal bahadur singh. the congress, which had earlier declined to have any truck with the ncp in municipal corporation polls across the state including nagpur, has decided to go on its own. though no big stalwart either from the congress and the ruling bjp has visited the city for the poll campaign till now, the ncp has taken the lead with its president sharad pawar addressing a public meeting recently.

15,HC asks govt to transfer official,"mumbai: in a significant order, justice vishnu sahai of the bombay high court last friday held that jayant padvi was not fit to continue as superintendent of a state government-run home for women in distress and directed that he be transferred forthwith. padvi, superintendent of the kasturba mahila vasatigruh at deonar (east), was held guilty of illegally detaining a woman and child at the home. he was also found to have committed criminal contempt of court by making false statements that interfered with the judicial proceedings. the court, however, accepted his apology and discharged a contempt notice issued against him.justice sahai, while passing strictures against padvi for the illegal detention, directed that the woman and child should be permitted to leave the home forthwith.a mahim resident, kalpana chhajed, and her four-year-old daughter were sent to the women's home by an over-zealous senior mahim police inspector on december 7, 2001. this followed several complaints made by ms chhajed of ill-treatment by her husband, dhiraj, and her parents-in-law.on december 16, 2001, ms chhajed wrote to the mahim police about her illegal detention. on december 24, the mahim police station wrote to padvi asking him to permit advocate s.s. butala, as per the rules, to secure ms chhajed's signature on a vakalatnama so he could legally represent her. but on december 26, butala was not given permission by padvi to meet ms chhajed.following this on january 1, 2002, deepak khedekar, a family friend of ms chhajed, made an application before additional chief metropolitan magistrate u.s. iyer for a search warrant to produce padvi, ms chhajed and her daughter in court in order to record her statement. ms iyer, however, rejected the application on the grounds that ``no case is made out to issue a search warrant''. the magistrate also observed that the mother-daughter duo did ``not appear to be wrongfully confined''.khedekar then moved the high court, seeking ms chhajed's liberty. padvi was directed by justice sahai, who heard the matter, to remain present in the court and to produce ms chhajed and her daughter.on february 1, ms chhajed, when finally produced in the high court, said that she did not wish to stay on at the vasatigruh. justice sahai castigated padvi for also making false statements in court. padvi, when asked, had said he prevented butala from meeting ms chhajed as the former did not obtain permission from the mahim police. his lie was established by the letter sent by the mahim police to him - which he admitted he had received.justice sahai was categorical in his observations that padvi's false statement made the offence a criminal contempt of court as it had interfered with judicial proceedings as per provisions of contempt of courts act. he, however, observed that ``the majesty of law and larger considerations of justice would be satisfied'' if padvi's ``unconditional apology'' was accepted.justice sahai observed that it would be ``wholly improper'' for padvi to continue as superintendent of the vasatigruh for an additional reason. in a letter written by ms chhajed to khedekar, she had mentioned that padvi prevented her from leaving by saying she was their ``lottery'' and she was allowed to go by engaging a lawyer what would they eat?padvi denied he ever said this. but justice sahai was loathe to accept his denial. ``we dare say if he could make a false statement before us, he could also make a false denial,'' the judge noted and said in any case, the facts of the case made it expedient that padvi no longer continue at the home.the state women and child department has been directed to transfer padvi within two weeks.

16,"Dowry death cases require extra care, rules apex court","new delhi: the supreme court has cautioned the courts dealing with cases of dowry deaths against blindly relying on the statements given by the kin of deceased without corroborating evidence. dismissing haryana government's appeal against the acquittal of husband and father-in-law of a woman who died in ""abnormal circumstances"" within two years of marriage, the court said: ""it is not the quantity but the quality of witnesses which matters for determining the guilt or innocence of the accused."" the prosecution had examined several witnesses who were, however, declared hostile, but on the testimony of deceased's father that his daughter was being harassed over dowry, the trial court convicted the husband and his father under sections 304b and 498a of indian penal code (harassment and culpable homicide not amounting to murder). testing the statement of deceased's father, the high court acquitted the accused saying his testimony was worth relying on. he had never told the police that the deceased had been harassed over dowry but he said so before the court. upholding acquittal, a bench comprising justice r p sethi and justice bisheshwar prasad singh said: ""it is equally true that when a case is based upon the testimony of only witness, his statement must be confidence inspiring, leaving no doubts in the mind of the court being above from all suspicions"". agreeing with the high court order, the bench said that conviction could not be based on the statement of deceased's father ""as he stood contradicted in material particulars as deposed by him before the investigating officer and thereafter in the court"". if the high court had not doubted his statement, the situation would have been different. the court said :""if two views are possible, one which is favourable to the accused has to be accepted"". though the father had said that the demand for dowry was met through his son, the latter did not support this statement. neither deceased's uncle nor her cousin said that she was ever harassed over dowry.
