0,BSP seeks special trains for rally,"LUCKNOW: Better late than never. It took a tragedy and loss of a dozen lives for the Mayawati Government to realise that there has to be a method in â€˜madnessâ€™ while flexing its muscles through rallies â€” dhikkar, chetawani, pardaphash, or whatever else.

So, the local Northern Railway and North Eastern Railway authorities have been approached well in advance with requisitions for special trains and additional bogeys.

The April 14 BSP pardaphash rally, planned on the birth anniversary of Dalit icon Babasaheb Ambedkar, promises to be bigger, both in magnitude and grandeur, than all previous ones. And, no one can vouch for it with greater conviction than those employees of Model Jail who were rendered homeless overnight, thanks to the ever-expanding Ambedkar rally ground. If one goes by the preparations, the April 14 rally is bound to witness much more crowd than the September 28 mahadhikkar rally â€” then said to be â€˜biggest-everâ€™ in the city â€” which culminated in the stampede at Charbagh railway station. On that occasion, the rallyists were brought to the city in herds from all over the state and then left to fend for themselves. So, Charbagh was milling with unmanageable rallyists â€” over a lakh of them â€” and an stampede was just a foregone conclusion.

In order to avoid any such tragedy, this time the organisers have decided to channelise both incoming and outgoing crowd in a proper manner. A senior district administration official recently met senior officials of both NR and NER and requested them to provide special trains â€” three from the NR and two from the NER â€” to handle the rallyists. â€œThey had approached us and we have given them all the details about charges etc. They had promised to get back with the required money. Once the money is deposited, we will start making arrangements,â€� says DRM NR RK Bansal.

But, has the Railways got the payment for special trains, which were arranged after the September 28 tragedy. Bansal evades the question. â€œThat was before my tenure,â€� he says â€œand I am yet to find it out.â€� Although, there was no requisition for special trains, the then DRM NR Kamlesh Gupta had supervised the traffic after the stampede and 11 special trains were run on the September 28 night to places like Kanpur, Saharanpur, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Allahabad and Aligarh. Over 1.25 lakh passengers had boarded the trains from Charbagh that night instead of the normal 30,000. The Railways, however, never got the payment of Rs 4 lakh per train. The tragedy, which had brought much embarrassment to chief minister Mayawati, instead paved way for a blame game between the state government and Railways.

The Railways had set up a three-member internal inquiry committee, which subsequently gave a clean chit to the Northern Railway officials. But, not to be outdown, the chief minister met Union railway minister Nitish Kumar on this issue and DRM Gupta was made a scapegoat. That jolt however, has made the organisers wiser. The Railways, however, still not taken responsibility of security. And the chief secretary has reportedly been written about the RPFâ€™s â€˜limitationsâ€™ in managing the rallying passengers.

2,Huge rally held against Iraq war,"HYDERABAD: The Forum Against War, led by scientist PM Bhargava, on Sunday organised a large rally here against the US led coalitionâ€™s attack on Iraq.

The rally, which began from the Charminar and ended at Sundaraiah Park in Barkatpura, was addressed by Bhargava, MIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, CPI and CPI-M state secretaries Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy and B V Raghavulu.

Balladeer Gaddar was also present. The participants, numbering a few thousands, shouted slogans against the war against Iraq and later burnt effigies of US president George W Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair.

The speakers criticised the United States and Britain for waging the war and called for a boycott of all American and British products by the people as a protest against what they said was â€˜unilateralâ€™ decision by the United States and Britain to attack Iraq. The participants took a pledge to boycott all British and US products till such time that the two countries would have paid adequate penalties for waging a war on Iraq.

3,New fee ruling will pinch middle class,"MUMBAI: Smruti Erande didnâ€™t think it would be difficult getting her two daughters through college. It would mean cutting corners a wee bit, she thought.

After all, her husband worked with the corporate finance division of Rashtriya Chemical Fertilisers and there was enough money to take a loan and buy a car.

Like any middle-class family, the Erandes believed they could comfortably send their children to a medical or engineering college. A recent supreme court order has probably changed all that.

The apex court said private, unaided institutions could fix their own fees and make a reasonable profit in the process. For hundreds of parents like Ms Erande, it could mean having to pay at least twice or thrice the fees currently charged.

â€œWe are very nervous,â€™â€™ says Ms Erande. â€œMy eldest daughter is in the twelfth standard and she wants to be a doctor.â€™â€™ Private medical institutes have recommended to the government that they be allowed to charge around Rs 2 lakhs every year from students.

Ms Erandeâ€™s worries have not abated with the Maharashtra governmentâ€™s promises to do its best to keep education affordable. In a cabinet decision taken last week, the state set up a regulatory body comprising chartered accountants, educationists and economists to vet fee hike proposals from unaided institutes.

However, if a management is to recover the expenditure it incurs in running a college, fees will go up by at least 100 per cent, says V. Shankar, a trustee of the South Indian Education Society that runs several colleges in the city.

College managements say itâ€™s unfair to expect them to subsidise higher education, when no funds are forthcoming from the government.

â€œWe are paying fifth pay commission scales to our teachers, there is water and electricity charges. If you take all that into account, we spend around Rs 5 lakhs every year on each student studying medicine,â€™â€™ says Dr Sudhir Kadam, a trustee of Mahatma Gandhi Mission that runs several medical colleges in the state.

â€œA middle-class family will find it difficult to pay these high fees,â€™â€™ says Shyam Chandragiri, whose son is in the twelfth standard and wants to take up engineering. A free seat in an engineering course came for Rs 12,000 till now but it could be anything over Rs 40,000 per year soon.

Mr Chandragiri has set up a Parentsâ€™ Forum to fight the imminent fee hike. But itâ€™s unclear if parents have any recourse, now that the cabinet has already taken a decision.

As private institutes brandish a supreme court order, there doesnâ€™t seem to be much of a legal remedy either. â€œOut of compulsion, we will end paying these high fees, may be by taking a loan,â€™â€™ says Mr Chandragiri.

4,Parsis ask minister to protect Bahrot Caves,"MUMBAI: The World Zarathushti Cultural Foundation has petitioned Union culture and tourism minister Jagmohan to have the ancient Bahrot Caves near Sanjan, on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border, listed as a national monument.

In the 13th century, these caves sheltered the sacred Iranshahâ€”the first fire to be consecrated in India after the Zoroastrians landed on the western Indian coast in the 7th century AD. The Zoroastrians sought refuge in these caves after Muslim invaders attacked Sanjan, where the Parsis had been living under the patronage of the Hindu rulers.

The Parsis fought off the invaders to keep their holy fire burning in these caves for 12 years, before moving it to Bansda and much later to Udwada,where it is still enshrined.

The World Zarathushti Cultural Foundation, a charitable trust dedicated to documenting and protecting Parsi Zoroastrian culture, has urged the minister to bring the caves under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India as soon as possible.

Mr Jagmohanâ€™s office is said to be considering the matter, according to officials in the Union culture ministry. Today, many Parsis make a pilgrimage to the Bahrot caves to perform â€˜jashansâ€™ (thanksgiving ceremonies).

â€œThey make this pilgrimage despite the fact that the caves are in a precarious condition and, moreover, are not easy to get to,â€™â€™ says historian Mani Kamerkar, who, along with Homi Dhalla, heads the foundation.

The caves are situated in the heart of a reserve forest and in the absence of a proper pathway to the Bahrot hill from the nearest village of Aswali, the visitors have to struggle through six kilometres of forest to get to them.

Adds Dr Dhalla, â€œWe are praying that the Union culture ministry brings the caves under the ASI because that will ensure a measure of protection and also help us to mobilise the community to help improve the conditions at the site.â€™â€™ The foundation has already drawn up a repair plan for the decaying cave complex. The scheme was drawn up last year by Mumbaibased architect Pankaj Joshi, an associate member of PUKAR (Partners for Urban Knowledge, Action and Research), a research group.

â€œThe Bahrot complex holds seven caves, a few of whose roofs have caved in and walls have developed cracks and fissures. These can be consolidated without too much difficulty,â€™â€™ Mr Joshi says.

â€œItâ€™s certainly a historically significant site because apart from the caves, there are two sets of fortifications on the hill. Between the fortifications and the caves there are several plinths, which suggest some form of settlement existed there. These areas need an archaeological examination.â€™â€™

If the site is brought under the ASIâ€™s custody, Dr Kamerkar and Dr Dhalla hope it will excavate the place. Even if does not, their foundation hopes to implement the repair scheme just as soon as they collect the Rs 30 lakhs required to consolidate the caves and build the six km-long pathway. They have approached the Parsi Panchayat and members of the community to donate to the project.

â€œUnfortunately, the response has been lukewarm,â€™â€™ mourns Dr Kamerkar. â€œOur community seems to lack a sense of history.â€™â€™ Researcher-author and heritage activist Pheroza Godrej is inclined to agree.

â€œItâ€™s a sorry comment on our community, but many Parsis are simply not aware of their historical past. Very few of them have probably heard of the Bahrot Caves or even about Sanjan,â€™â€™ she says. â€œEven the more enlightened ones are not interested in heritage conservation. Look at how neglectful the community has been of the built heritage of even our main pilgrim-centre of Udwada.â€™â€™

Supporting the foundationâ€™s demand for the caves to be listed, she states that she will do her bit to help the conservation project. Parsi Panchayat chairman Minoo Shroff takes a similar position.

The panchayatâ€™s priorities are to help the community with medicare, housing, higher education, social security for the aged and the infirm, he says. However, he adds, â€œWe do recognise the importance of heritage conservation. We will certainly try and pitch in with some funds for the Bahrot project.â€™â€™

6,"MLA's men clash with Dalits, 3 die","SASARAM: At least three persons were killed in an exchange of fire between the alleged supporters of Samata Party MLA Sunil Pandey, against whom many criminal cases are pending, and Dalits at Gohi village under the Darihat police station of Rohtas district.

However, the district administration confirmed only one casualty.

One of the deceased, identified as Vinod Singh, is said to have been the right hand man of the MLA.

The exchange of fire between the two groups had been going on for the last three days. Dispute over the harvesting of wheat crop in some plots of land in the village is stated to be the cause of the clashes.

Sources said that even in the last two years, the village had witnessed firing between the MLAâ€™s supporters and the Dalits. Despite this, the local administration evinced little interest in solving the problem.

Dalits of the village alleged that the MLA, in collusion with some local officials, got some plots of land of Dalits transferred in the names of his family members. When the Dalits lodged their protest, the MLAâ€™s men allegedly attacked them with arms.

Last year, a criminal case against the MLA and his family members was lodged at the Darhat police station when a village Dalit was allegedly assaulted by the MLAâ€™s family members.

Police force had been deployed in the village as a precautionary measure following the report of tension in the village over land.

Senior police officers have rushed to the spot.

Meanwhile, DIG (provisions) Rituraj said in Patna that there was a clash between the MCC and the gang led by Sunil Pandey in Rohtas. A land dispute was the reason behind the incident, he said, adding there were no casualties, though.

7,Pak seeks third party arbitration on Indus,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan may seek third-party arbitration in order to resolve a dispute with India over the 450 MW Baghlihar hydro-power project on the Chenab river.

It is seeking to do so under the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. If the two countries decide to go in for third-party arbitration, it will be for the first time in the history of the over four-decade-old treaty.

The Pakistani move comes close on the heels of the failure of talks held over two days between the Permanent Indus Commissioners of India and Pakistan last month in Islamabad, where the only matter discussed was the Baghlihar project.

According to a report appearing in the Pakistani newspaper Daily Times earlier this month, Pakistan has decided to ask for a neutral expert after a meeting in the foreign office and that â€˜â€˜NESPAK (National Engineering Services of Pakistan) would prepare the case for Pakistan and could hire foreign consultants for helpâ€™â€™.

The report even said the Pakistan foreign office has â€˜â€˜also approached the World Bank, which is the guarantor of the IWT (Indus Water Treaty) and asked it to tell New Delhi to cease construction work on the Baghlihar project and in case it refuses, to stop funding Indian development projectsâ€™â€™.

The report said the Pakistan finance ministry had â€˜â€˜already released Rs 12 million for preparing the caseâ€™â€™ and that Pakistanâ€™s Permanent Indus Commissioner, Jamaat Ali Shah, â€˜â€˜is preparing a summary saying a neutral expert should be soughtâ€™â€™.

Reacting to the reported Pakistani move, sources in the Union water resources ministry said: â€˜â€˜Pakistanâ€™s apprehensions have no basis. We are sure that our construction parameters are well within the provisions of the treaty.â€™â€™

The sources also said that nothing has been heard from Pakistan on the matter since the February meeting. â€˜â€˜We are waiting for their response,â€™â€™ said an official.

While Pakistan can go for a neutral expert under the treaty, the official said it cannot do so unilaterally and will have to seek Indiaâ€™s consent on the appointeeâ€™s name.

Once complete, the Baghlihar project is expected to provide much-needed power to Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan has problems with the design of the project, maintaining that its gate-structure will divert the flow of the Chenab from its territory. India, on the other hand, has always maintained that such fears are unfounded since what is being constructed is a run-of-the-river project. Under the treaty, India was given unrestricted use of the eastern rivers of the Indus basin â€” the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi â€” while Pakistan was given unrestricted use of the western rivers â€” the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.

9,SC ruling a jolt to govt as VHP threatens action,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ruling on Monday, maintaining status quo on the `undisputed'' land in Ayodhya, has come as a setback to the BJP-led government.

The government''s legal advisers had told it that if the land was unfrozen, it could allow the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (RJN) to use it for religious activity. This, in turn, would have given the government some breathing space vis-a-vis an increasingly impatient VHP, which is now all set to intensify its agitation, with the RSS'' blessings.

Sources said the government will now come under increased pressure from the VHP, borne out on Monday itself when VHP chief Ashok Singhal described the verdict as ""Ram''s blessing in disguise"" and said: ""We should have got the `undisputed'' land to begin construction of the temple. Now it will be direct action and we will not rest till we get it all, including the disputed land.""

The RSS, on its part, said though it respected the court ruling, it was ""disappointed"" as it felt that the release of the `undisputed'' land would have taken them a ""step forward"". Spokesperson Ram Madhav said: ""The only option before the government now is to mobilise political opinion and pass legislation, while the VHP mobilises public opinion through its agitation."" He added that past experience had demonstrated that a solution through dialogue was not a ""pragmatic option"".

For the BJP-led government, none of this is good news. It had hoped that handing over the `undisputed'' land to the RJN would appease the VHP till the excavation ordered by the Allahabad High Court hopefully threw up evidence that might ""persuade"" the Muslims that a temple had existed there before the Babri Masjid. A senior BJP leader said: ""We are not talking about give and take, but about psychological pressure on the Muslims, which would lead to an out-of-court settlement.""

Of late, the BJP central leadership had begun to say that the key to solving Ayodhya lay not in the courts but in a consensus between the two communities. Two senior cabinet ministers had told Times News Network separately that a court verdict on the title suit, whenever it came, would be impossible to implement without endorsement from both communities.

With this line of thinking being echoed by more than one key player in the BJP, it would appear that this is one of the lessons the party has learnt after being in power for five years.

Indeed, the BJP may have learnt the need for compromise, but at an informal meeting at the recent RSS pratinidhi sabha of senior BJP, RSS and VHP leaders, it was impressed upon the BJP that the dispute had to be resolved very soon. Sources said: ""It was underlined that after five years, we were no nearer a solution. And if this continued, it would erode our credibility.""

10,Ex-official accused of assault commits suicide,"NEW DELHI: A former official in the home ministry, who was facing a case of sexually assaulting his daughter in 1995, has committed suicide.

K S Jakoo worked as the under-secretary with the ministry. He died in Safdarjung hospital on Sunday after staying in hospital for four days. The hospital has already conducted an autopsy test on his body.

Jakoo was granted bail after four years in custody.

He reportedly consumed poison on March 26 at his residence in Nanakpura. The allegations were levelled against Jakoo in 1995 when his four-year-old daughter accused him of sexually assaulting her.

Four more persons, including two women, were also involved. All the accused were Jakooâ€™s colleagues from the MHA.

As per the allegations, Jakoo used to allegedly take his daughter to his office. From there he and the co-accused took the victim to a hotel in Connaught Place and where a room had been booked.

The accused then consumed alcohol as well as drugs and assaulted the victim.

After a few hours in the hotel, Jakoo would take his daughter back to the office and threaten her with dire consequences if she revealed the incidents to anybody.

At home Jakoo used to make his wife, working with the department of Central Excise, unconscious and then assault the victim.

The girl told her aunt who later informed the victimâ€™s mother.

Although a case was filed with the Parliament Street police station, Jakoo was arrested after the MHA transferred the case to Central Bureau of Investigation.

It was Jakooâ€™s case which prompted the Parliament to review laws related to rape following which the law commission made the recommendations.

During the trial, Jakooâ€™s daughter supported the statement which she earlier given to the police.

She also stood to her version during her cross-questioning.

Another of Jakooâ€™s daughters also gave testimony against him.

Jakooâ€™s advocate H R Khan Suhel said: â€˜â€˜He was very upset about the fact that his two daughters gave testimony against him. He consumed poison and committed suicide.â€™â€™

He said Jakoo was having an extra-marital affair, that his wife knew about, with one of the co-accused. Jakooâ€™s case is still pending in the court and will be heard on Tuesday.
