0,Rumour sparks violence in Unjha,"AHMEDABAD: Violence erupted in Dasaj village of Unjha taluka of Mehsana district late on Monday. Trouble was sparked off following rumours that a rabid dog had gone berserk during the conclusion of a religious ceremony.

Police said several persons were seriously injured after incidents of arson and group clashes. However, there was no information about casualties.

1,VHP 'activist' held for involvement in riots,"VADODARA: The district police arrested one Jayanti Rathwa, said to be Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) worker, for his alleged involvement in the communal riots that took place in the tribal belt of the district in the aftermath of the Sabarmati Express carnage.

Rathwa was reportedly involved in some of the worst incidents of rioting in the tribal areas. He is alleged to have led a mob of tribals that went on rampage in Panwad village of the district.

The entire minority population of the village was driven out and their premises were looted and set ablaze. The administration had a tough time in ensuring that those displaced returned to the village. Rathwa was absconding for quite some time till his arrest.

District superintendent of police Piyush Patel said that cases of arson and attempt to murder, among others, were registered against Rathwa in four police stations, including Chhota Udepur, Kanwant, Karali and Bodeli.

Sources said that Rathwa also had political ambitions and was working in that direction. Meanwhile, Panwad village observed a total bandh on Monday in protest against Rathwa''s arrest. The bandh call was given by unidentified persons by placing a board in the village.

Officials said that no organisation had claimed responsibility for giving the bandh call. ""The bandh could have been because of a sense of fear rather than genuine support for Rathwa,"" an official said.

2,3 die in fresh Gujarat riots,"VADODARA: Two brothers, in their twenties, were stabbed to death in Mahudha town of Kheda district on Monday morning, sparking a fresh bout of communal flare-up in the area even as Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh arrived in Gujarat to review the arrangements for the December 12 assembly election.

One person, belonging to the minority community, was lynched by a mob in the evening soon after the funeral procession of the two brothers was taken out in the tense town.

Mahudha is barely 25 km from Dakor, where Chief Minister Narendra Modi embarked on his Gaurav Yatra which took him to Godhra later in the day.

A tiff during an inter-community night cricket match on Sunday triggered the violence. Ironically, the concept of such inter-community matches was promoted by the district administration to restore peace after the riots earlier this year.

Kheda SP Manoj Agarwal said rioters looted and set ablaze 15 to 20 shops. The brothers, Kartik (26) and Bhavin Patel (24), were stabbed before the violence erupted. Both were taken to the Nadiad Civil Hospital where they were pronounced dead. Several people were reportedly injured in Monday''s violence.

The brothers were reportedly involved in a brawl during the cricket match on Sunday. It all began when a man, identified as Sarfraz, was allegedly beaten up with a cricket stump up during the match. Agarwal said that on Monday Sarfaraz and two others went to the Patels'' shop to take revenge. They stabbed the brothers and fled.

The situation in the town spiralled out of control as the news of the killing spread. Mobs of both communities went on an arson and looting spree. Police had to fire 12 rounds and lob six tear-gas shells to disperse the rioters. However, curfew was not imposed in the town.

Over 200 district police personnel were deployed in the town to ward off any untoward incident. Agarwal said that a company of the Home Guard border wing would also be reaching the town.

Sources said that Sarfaraz had been picked up in the evening. Other accused involved in the stabbing had been identified and would be arrested soon, the SP said.

The incident once again underlines the fragile peace in Gujarat, where communal riots break out at the slightest provocation.

The situation in the town is said to be highly volatile. The police allowed the funeral procession of the two youths in the evening but more violence was reported as a mob dragged out a person from a state transport bus and lynched him near the cremation ground.

3,Police told to nab absconding rioters,"GANDHINAGAR: Following the Election Commission''s instructions, Gujarat''s home department has asked the district police chiefs and district electoral officers to videograph election speeches to monitor communal overtones during electioneering.

The state home department simultaneously asked district police officials to make ""immediate arrests"" of those whose names appear in FIRs and in the reports of the agencies investigating the communal riots.

""According to estimates, there would be between 200 and 250 absconders who would need to be arrested to ensure trouble-free polls in the state,"" a senior home department official revealed, adding that ""there may be many more absconders than those there in the investigators'' reports. But one cannot hazard a guess.""

Following reports that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad yatra, to start this week from Akshardham temple with a replica of the burnt-down S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express, the home department on Monday swung into action to prevent this from happening as it might evoke communal passions. ""The home department is not taking any chances,"" the official said.

Explains additional chief secretary (home) Ashok Narayan: ""We have to act tough following EC''s instructions to hold free and fair polls. The home department and the police force, after all, have to function directly under the EC machinery in the state.""

4,SP workers court arrest,"LUCKNOW: Amidst heavy police bandobast and much baton-wielding by the RAF and the men in khakhi, the Samajwadi Party national secretary Amar Singh and state general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav, along with a host of workers, were arrested at the Hazratganj crossing on Monday.

The two leaders were earlier detained at the Amausi airport where Amar Singh was reportedly hit by the police with rifle butts. Yadav, at a press conference later, alleged that the police showered the choicest abuses on them and then snatched the keys of their car, which later was taken back by them.

The SP Rajya Sabha candidate Abu Asim Azmi who was also present with them on the spot was arrested and sent to the Sarojininagar police station. The arrest of the SP activists was the outcome of the â€˜Virodh Diwasâ€™, the call for which was given by party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on November 6. The intent was to draw the attention of the masses towards the â€˜satta pakadâ€™ (sticking to power) policy of the BSP-BJP coalition which despite being reduced to a minority was refusing to quit. It also aimed at highlighting the â€˜unconstitutionalâ€™ role of the governor Vishnukant Shastri and his refusal to call the SP to form the government.

With the government cracking down on the SP leaders and workers on Sunday evening, the protest originally scheduled at the district collectorate was later held at the Hazratganj crossing. Instead of moving en masse, the workers chose to move in batches.

The first batch reached the crossing at 11:30 am. Led by local corporator Nasreen Jehan, they shouted anti-Mayawati and anti-Shastri slogans only to be chased by the baton-wielding police and RAF. They were bundled into a bus standing opposite the Gandhi Ashram and taken to the Police Lines. All through, the workers were being kept informed by partymen that Amar Singh had reached Lucknow from Delhi and was being detained along with Shivpal Singh Yadav at the airport. They were later told that the duo had been allowed to leave the airport but were now detained at the Jail Road. Both Singh and Yadav reached the Hazratganj crossing around 12 noon. Another batch of SP workers, led by senior leader Bhagwati Singh, national co-spokesman Dr Nishith Rai, MLC Arun Kumar Shukla alias Anna and city president Faqir Siddiqui were already staging a dharna when the duo arrived. The police had a tough time containing the workers who got charged upon seeing the leaders.

While cries of â€˜Mayawati Murdabadâ€™ and â€˜Rajyapal Wapas Jaoâ€™ were raised by the workers, Amar Singh made his way to the dharna site and squatted there. Lashing out at the BSP-BJP government and the governor for not calling the session of the Vidhan Sabha, he, along with Yadav, were later bundled in the waiting bus and taken to the Police Lines.

6,"RS polls over, BJP cracks whip","LUCKNOW: With Rajya Sabha elections out of the way, the state BJP leadership finally cracked the whip on 10 rebel MLAs who had defied the party leadership by fielding their candidate for the Rajya Sabha and the Vidhan Parishad seats against the official nominees of the party.

Soon after getting a nod from the central leadership on Monday, the leader of BJP Legislature Party Lalji Tandon petitioned the Speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi seeking disqualification of the group for their alleged anti-party activities.

Addressing a press conference, Tandon said that the conduct of the rebels had left the leadership with no option. â€œBy getting photographed with leaders of other parties and issuing statements in their favour, it looked as though they had already deserted our camp and and were acting in connivance with our rivals,â€� said Tandon. â€œThe party gave them enough time to rectify their mistakes but as there was no change in their conduct we were forced to take the extreme step,â€� he added.

Announcing that he had already submitted a petition seeking disqualification of Ravindra Pundir, Kovid Kumar Singh, Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh, Anil Kumar Verma, Daya Shanker Varma, Ram Pratap Singh, Badshah Singh, Ganga Bux Singh (MLA from Unnao) Chandramani Kant Singh and Narendra Singh Verma to the Speaker, Tandon said they would now wait for his decision. â€œIf the decision goes against them, the group shall lose its membership of the house and in that event there shall be fresh by-election in the constituencies he said. The errant group, he further stated, shall be disqualified to contest the election and also runs the risk of being debarred from contesting the election for next six years.

Talking to reporters, the BJP president Vinay Katiyar said that by a letter addressed to the dissident group on November 7, he had directed them to restrain from fielding their candidate against the official nominee and If they did so it would be interpreted as an anti-party act. The group did not pay any heed to the warning, he said. There will be no dialogue with them any more as both sides had reached a point of no return, Katiyar said.

The party leadership, he added, was also contemplating taking disciplinary action against the members of Vidhan Parishad who were indulging in similar activities. Significantly, the petition does not include the name of the leader of the rebel group and convener of the Save BJP Committee Ganga Bhakt Singh and Shivakant Ojha. â€œSingh neither went to Raj Bhavan nor proposed the name of Suresh Nanda so he is in the clear so far,â€� Katiyar said in answer to a query.

7,3 arrested for running fake visa racket,"NEW DELHI: With the arrest of three persons recently, Delhi Police claims to have busted a fake visa racket. Deputy commissioner of police (economic offence wing) Dinesh Bhatt said the accused would charge Rs 5 lakh for issuing a fake American or Canadian visa.

Bhatt said Kamaljeet Singh, a resident of Punjab, complained that he had approached one Umesh Giri, who ran an agency in Connaught Place, to arrange for visas in June. â€˜â€˜Singh gave Giri passports of two of his relatives who wanted to go to the US and Canada and paid Rs 2 lakh in advance. On November 7, Giri contacted Singh and told him that the visas had been arranged. He gave Singh photocopies of the visas and demanded the balance payment of Rs 8 lakh before returning the passports,â€™â€™ Bhatt said.

Singh got suspicious since his relatives did not go to the embassies. He asked Giri to give him a day to make the payment. On verification, he found that the visas were fake and had not been issued by the embassies concerned. Singh then complained to the police and Giri and two of his accomplices were arrested.

8,UK study nails Naidu's govt on FFW scam,"HYDERABAD: As Gujarat burned earlier this year, the TDP regime ruling the state threw dark hints at pulling out support to the NDA government at the Centre and wrested from it a huge tranche of rice for its welfare programme, says a study sponsored by the Department for International Development (DFID) of the UK.

The Centre agreed to release the rice to the state''s Food for Work (FFW) scheme ignoring the allegations of graft besetting that programme. ""No other NDA partner has recieved the largesse that the Vajpayee government bestowed on the TDP. There is plenty of evidence of favoured status to AP,"" says the draft study.

DFID is a major donor to the state. The report also details how some TDP leaders and government officials connived to get FFW rice ""recycled"". After sustained demands for accounts by the opposition and the media, the government conceded that approximately 20 per cent of the FFW rice had been siphoned off.

In money terms, this translates into Rs 6 billion. But, the report claims, the level of corruption was far greater. The state received more than 3 million tonnes of rice between Sept 2001 and July 2002, enough to feed 20 million workers for nearly a year. This would have a market value of Rs 20 billion.

But not much of this rice went to the people it was meant for.

""Misappropriation and corruption began at the lower tiers of officialdom and spread upwards with ever-increasing margins. The impunity with which politcians, line department officials, contractors (although there were not meant to be any) and panchayat staff stole from the poor without fear of punishment, was testimony to the social and political sanction that such acts by the powerful have in the existing system,"" the report says.

According to the study, ""the government of Andhra Pradesh lifted the rice and then ''allowed'' it to be sold to generate the much-needed cash for the cash component (of the FFW scheme), as well as cash for political purposes."" In a section titled ''Growing malpractice, growing political immunity and growing impunity,'' the study reveals that in some villages where the survey was conducted, ""47 per cent to 99 per cent of the rice was misappropriated"".

Disregarding the government claims on the action taken against irregularities, the study says ""apart from a few high-profile bookings and arrests, little was done to change the monitoring and evaluation of FFW.""

10,Newly-wed couple commits suicide,"GUNTUR: A young couple committed suicide in the intervening hours of Sunday and Monday here in Nehrunagar in Guntur.

Both of them hanged themselves separately in a span of four hours. Police suspect that financial problems and sociological pressures might have forced the couple to take the extreme step.

The deceased Kongara Srinivasa Rao, 22, belonged to the weaver community, while Anitha, 20, was from the Scheduled Caste community in January last.

Srinivasa Rao was working at a textile shop and Anitha was employed in a private firm. They were facing the ire of elders as both of them belonged to different castes.

On Sunday night, Srinivasa Rao and Anitha returned home after attending a wedding in the colony.

Immediately after reaching home, Srinivasa Rao forcibly sent Anitha out and hanged himself from the ceiling fan by locking the door from inside.

Anitha shouted for help, but by the time neighbours broke open the door, he was dead.

Shocked at the death of her husband, Anitha returned home and hanged herself at around 4 am.

However, the sister of Anitha alleged that her sister was brutally murdered by the family members of Srinivasa Rao. She said that they do not know why Anitha''s husband took the extreme step.

11,APPSC objects to direct govt recruitments,"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) has reportedly objected to the direct recruitments being carried out by various government corporations. The commission has also said to have objected the contract basis recruitment done by a few government departments.

According to commission sources, top APPSC authorities reportedly sought government permission to recruit staff for Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams, APGenco, APTransco, APSRTC, and AP Tourism Development Corporation.

The government corporations, besides the education, home, health, law, and agriculture departments, are taking up recruitments on their own.

The health department is recruiting medical officers and civil assistant surgeons, while the home department has started a specialised police recruitment board for selecting constables and sub-inspectors.

The posts of judicial officers, agriculture and veterinary officers are also being advertised by the departments concerned. The sources pointed out that the APPSC was formed as a statutory body exclusively to make appointments to all services in the state. The commission has over 2,000 staff and expertise in conducting examinations.

The corporations and the government departments, in the last two years, recruited over 20,000 candidates in various categories, and spent about Rs 10 crore for the purpose.

With the corporations and the departments having no special staff for the recruitment, they were taking out the existing employees for examination work.

According to an APPSC member, the UPSC, service commissions of Tamil Nadu,Kerala, Maharashtra and several other states were conducting all types of recruitments.

12,Observers will monitor polls in Gujarat: EC,"AHMEDABAD\GODHRA: Two teenaged brothers were stabbed to death in Mahudha town of Kheda, sparking fresh communal riots on Monday morning even as Chief Election Commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh arrived in Gujarat to review the arrangements for the December 12 polls.

A tiff during a cricket match played in the town on Sunday night is said to be the reason for the brothersâ€™ murder. The situation in Mahudha went out of control as news of the murder spread. Nearly 20 shops were looted in the arson and violence that followed.

The police had to fire 12 rounds and lob six tear-gas shells to disperse the rioters. Violence claimed two more lives on Monday night.While the first victim was a passenger in a bus which was attacked by a stone-pelting mob near Mahudha, a crude bomb explosion killed a scrap shop owner at Dani Limda.

However, curfew was not imposed in Mahudha, which is about 25 km from Dakor, where chief minister Narendra Modi began the ninth segment of the gaurav yatra on Monday with a blistering attack on Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

Mr Lyngdoh, who met a cross-section of people, NGOs and politicians later in the day, said that the government had been asked to submit a report on the proposed Hindu Pad Padshahi Yatra to be taken out by the VHP from November 15.

The Election Commission will then decide whether to allow the yatra or not. The VHP yatra is scheduled to start from Akshardham on November 15 and end on December the anniversary of the Babri masjid demolition.

The CEC, who arrived in Ahmedabad on a two-day visit along with his fellow commissioners B.B. Tandon and T.S. Krishnamurty, held detailed discussions with the stateâ€™s top bureaucracy on the conduct of free and fair elections on December 12.

Mr Lyngdoh has asked the district collectors to ensure full protection to the minorities, especially in the riot-affected areas. â€œThe international community is as interested in the Gujarat polls as it was in the Jammu and Kashmir elections,â€™â€™ he said.

â€œThe credibility of Indian democracy will be under the scanner,â€™â€™Mr Lyngdoh said. Special observers will be deputed for the December 12 polling, as was the case with the J&K polls. â€œThe situation in Gujarat may not be as dangerous as in J&K,â€™â€™ he said, â€œbut it is nasty here.â€™â€™

The state director general of police, who told the CEC that they had identified 8,000 sensitive booths, has been asked to prepare a detailed map of the areas worst-affected by the recent communal violence.

13,SGPC members asked to elect deserving Gursikhs,"PATIALA: The Gobind Sadan, New Delhi, being run by Baba Virsa Singh, who has very close relations with top politicians of Delhi and Punjab, has appealed to the SGPC members to elect only deserving Gursikhs during the ensuing elections.It has also asked them to evaluate whether they were fulfilling their duties.The sadan had played a role in the management of gurdwaras of Delhi in 1971 after which the Delhi Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee was formed. The sadan has announced that if the 'Guru' gave the sadan the ''responsibility to run the management of gurdwaras of Punjab in a right way, then they would perform it successfully.'' Interestingly, there is no member in the SGPC representing the Gobind Sadan.The sadan has also appealed to all the factions of the SGPC to not to indulge in factionalism and 'horse trading' through political interference saying that 'selfish' persons indulged in such practices. Criticising the SGPC members, the sadan said that wrong books were published regarding the Gurus while Guru Teg Bahadur was projected as a looter but ''your (SGPC members) feelings were not hurt and none of you had uttered even a single word which proved that you have no faith in the Guru and can no longer be called Sikhs.''The Sikh history has shown that whosoever had tried to damage the gurdwaras, had lost his generations to pay the price for his misdeeds. The sadan further said that the Sikh community had given sacrifices to form the SGPC to get the management of gurdwaras free from the clutches of selfish priests so that the Sikhs could run gurdwaras democratically.

14,Amritsar fortified for SGPC elections,"AMRITSAR: The Golden Temple city was put under heavy siege on Monday, on the eve of the crucial Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee election, even as police continued to crackdown on Akali activists loyal to former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal.

Not leaving anything to chance, police entered the SGPC complex again on Monday and put tall barriers on the road that separates the complex from the Golden Temple.

All entry points to the SGPC complex were sealed. No one except media personnel, SGPC members and VIPs were being allowed inside.

Though the main passage leading to the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple was open, devotees had to cross many hurdles before reaching there.

Personnel of the special anti-riot cell of the Punjab police force in full combat gear were stationed around the Golden Temple and SGPC complex.

Meanwhile, continuing its crackdown on Akali activists owing allegiance to Badal, police on Monday arrested nine persons in Kharar district.

The total number of Akalis arrested in Kharar in the run-up to the SGPC poll has risen to 35 now.

15,SGPC polls mirror Sikh power struggle in state,"CHANDIGARH: The unprecedented hype and controversy that the annual elections to the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committeeâ€™s (SGPC) 15-member executive kicked up this year has caught many by surprise. Until now, the SGPC polls have always been an uneventful affair, even during the militancy phase.

Why have the SGPC polls assumed such significance this year? Explains Amarinder Singh, ""There is an impression that those controlling the SGPC and its vast resources, control Sikh politics and hence this struggle."" The SGPC controls all the historic Sikh shrines and has a budget of Rs 200 crore.

The two Akali factions, led by once thick friends Parkash Singh Badal and Gurcharan Singh Tohra, declared a war this time. Even the Congress government resorted to alleged partisan intervention to support the Tohra group on the pretext of ""maintaining law and order"".

The threat by both contenders to arrive at the venue of the election on Tuesday, along with thousands of their supporters, came handy for the government to clamp prohibitory orders in the entire state and conduct an early morning swoop in the Golden Temple complex on Akali activists.

To avoid any confrontation with the rivals or the police, Badal herded his loyalist SGPC members to Balasar in Haryana. He then took them to Delhi, from where they were airlifted to Amritsar on Monday to ensure their participation. The SGPC has been the lifeline for the Akalis who have always launched their agitations from historic gurdwaras in the past. Amarinder Singh is anxious to snap this lifeline which has provided resources, logistic support and cadre to the Akalis for its agitational politics in the past.

The SAD has already announced its plans to launch a jail bharo agitation from month end. Perhaps, this was an immediate provocation for the state government to ensure that both the SGPC and its gurdwaras do not fall under Badalâ€™s control. Badal had been the chief minister till last year and had a free run to get his men elected to the SGPC executive. With the change of government, the rival faction headed by Tohra, who has held the coveted post of the SGPC president 24 times in the past, wants to stake claim again.

What has intensified the struggle to capture the SGPC is Amarinder Singhâ€™s tacit support to Tohra. The CM has been using the government machinery and even the Sikh Gurdwara Judicial Commission to weaken the Badal camp, by disqualifying his loyalist SGPC members from voting in the SGPC polls. In all, there are 176 SGPC members and disqualification of half a dozen members could be decisive.

To counter Amarinder, Badal has approached the Union government to ensure free and fair executive elections. The Centre has sent observers and an NDA team.

17,"Marandi govt wasting money, says Mandal","RANCHI: Former MP and working president of Jharkhand Vikas Dal (JVD) Suraj Mandal said the forthcoming Godda Lok Sabha bypoll would be an acid test for the Babulal Marandi government ""which has drained the state exchequer in the name of Jharkhand anniversary celebrations.""

The December 12 by-election would be an ""acid test"" for the BJP-led government''s performance as ""a defeat would prove people''s disenchantment over the way it is running the state,"" Mandal told newsmen here on Saturday.

The JVD leader, who would file his nomination papers on November 22 for the by-election, alleged the state government was engaged in draining Jharkhand''s exchequer in the name of the November 15 anniversary celebration.

The JVD would launch a satyagraha on November 14 to protest the ""lavish November 15 celebrations"" and give a memorandum to governor M Rama Jois, Mandal said.

He expressed apprehensions that Marandi''s ""Greater Ranchi"" development ""dreams"" would lead to ""displacement"" of thousands of villagers.

The JVD leader, who was once the second in command in the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, pooh-poohed Jharkhand Disom Party leader and MP Salkhan Murmu''s claim that JDP had the support of N E Horo''s Jharkhand Party.

Appealing to all secular parties to back him, Mandal said he had finished second to late Jagdambi Prasad of BJP in the last Godda Lok Sabha poll.

""But, this time, my chances of winning are bright as the people are disillusioned with the ruling party for neglecting their constituency, he added.""

18,CPI-ML to hold rally in Patna on November 30,"PATNA: The CPI-ML (Liberation) has decided to take out an ""anti-war, anti-imperialism"" rally at Patna on November 30 to mark the conclusion of the seventh party congress.

More than 800 delegates from 22 states and representatives from the international left and anti-imperialist movement will participate in the ML congress which takes place once in five years.

The debate and discussion on the draft documents which was sent by the party to all its committees and members have been completed. Opinions and suggestions have reached the party headquarters in Delhi.

The party''s central committee met in Jharkhand from November 5 to 8 to update this draft document. The updated document will be placed before the seventh congress.

ML general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya and several other leaders are now attending meetings of state committees in several states and taking stock of the congress preparations.

The main emphasis of draft document is on independent assertion of the left through powerful mass movements and resistance struggles. The draft report says, ""in today''s situation, there are two options for the left in the country â€” more direct collaboration with the congress or an emphasis on independent assertion of the left by building left and democratic unity around a left core.""

It also says, ""any effective anti-fascist front can only be built on the basis of powerful worker-peasant struggles. Developing more and more pockets of militant struggles of the rural poor remains the key to facing the growing fascist threat in the country"".

The draft report is also very critical of ""unscrupulous sections of the non-congress camp"". It says, ""opportunist politicians who never tire of invoking the legacies of Lohia, Jaya Prakash Narayan and Ambedkar have proved to be an excellent prop for the disciples of Gowalkars and admirers of Hitler.""

The party congress will address itself to the crucial question of giving a fitting rebuff to the growing offensive of communal, fascist forces in the country.

22,"Review disinvestment, says Fernandes","BANGALORE: Defence Minister George Fernandes said on Tuesday he has suggested to the government to review its disinvestment programme and go in for course correction if needed.

Addressing the Conference, Fernandes described the current crisis faced by the coffee industry as a ""major calamity"", adding, growers were justified in seeking relief.

He said it was necessary to have some kind of a regulatory framework - like fixing quota for each coffee producing country - to stablise prices of the commodity at the global level.

""The Union government should involve itself, if such an initiative is contemplated"", he said, and also urged coffee growers to look at diversification. There is a need to highlight coffee''s medicinal values as well as ""research findings"" that it''s a panacea for some diseases, he added.

23,Samajwadi Party to go it alone in Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: Given a cold shoulder by the Congress, the Samajwadi Party on Tuesday said that it would go it alone in the Gujarat Assembly elections and allowed its state unit a free hand in deciding the number of seats it would like to contest.

""We have decided to contest the Gujarat Assembly elections on our own strength. The party''s state unit will decide the number of seats to be contested,"" SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav told reporters after a meeting of the party''s Parliamentary Board here.

Yadav said that the Congress had made it clear it would not have any alliance with the Samajwadi Party in Gujarat. ""So, we have decided to fight on our own,"" he said, adding the number of seats the party would contest would be decided by the state unit.

To a question, he said that if the Congress was really not averse to working with like-minded secular parties, a beginning should have been made and ""it should start with Uttar Pradesh"".

Yadav was commenting on Congress president Sonia Gandhi''s remarks at Mount Abu that her party did not have a closed mind on working with like-minded secular forces, thereby indicating that she was not averse to coalition politics.

SP general secretary and spokesman Amar Singh said that discussions were held with senior Congress leaders Kamal Nath and Ahmed Patel on the possibility of an electoral adjustment in Gujarat.

""But Congress said we are not at all a force to reckon with in Gujarat and ruled out any alliance with us and so we have decided to go it alone there,"" he added.

24,Farmers oppose electricity meter proposal at farms,"PUNE: Strongly opposing the Maharashtra state electricity boardâ€™s (MSEB) decision to install electricity meters at farms, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has said it will not allow MSEB officials to enter farms for fitting meters.

State BKS vice-president Mauli Tupe said on Monday that metered supply of power for agricultural purpose was not acceptable to farmers.

The BKS has already launched a state-wide agitation against the move. Tupe said BKS activists will burn a meter in front of the MSEB office in Uralikanchan on November 14. Similar agitations have been planned at Maval, Shirur and Yavat, he added.

Tupe alleged that owners of farms which have been fitted with electricity meters have been getting bills with amounts three times higher than the rate based on horse power (HP).

â€œWe have been paying annual bills at the rate of Rs 1,400 per HP despite the fact that we donâ€™t use agriculture pumps throughout the year,â€� he said, adding that the MSEB was getting more money from the old system.

Rejecting the argument that meters were fixed to stop power thefts, Tupe said if this was the case, then power thefts should never occur in urban areas. District president Madhukar Temgire observed that the MSEB did not have adequate manpower to fit meters at farms in remote areas and take regular readings.

â€œFarmers will be burdened with the additional job of conveying meter readings to MSEB officials and will end up paying lump sum money if readings are not taken regularly,â€� he remarked. Tupe clarified that the BKS was against fitting electric meters at farms.

25,Health insurance for farmers from Wednesday,"BANGALORE: The first-ever health insurance scheme for farmers will be launched by the Karnataka government on November 14.

Cooperation Minister H. Viswanath told reporters here on Tuesday that the scheme â€” Yashaswini â€” will enable farmers to avail facilities in nearly 40 hospitals in the state after paying Rs 5 per month towards health insurance. The state government has tied-up with insurance companies and Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospital.

On November 14, when the scheme is launched, one lakh farmers will be enrolled. Of the total 1.89 crore farmers in various cooperative societies in the state, 50 lakh would be covered in the health insurance scheme in the first phase, Vishwanath said.

According to Shetty, Narayana Hrudayalaya would tie-up with Goa, West Bengal and Kerala state governments during the next three months for a similar scheme. ""A large number of people do not get proper health care facilities. We hope this scheme will target those who were deprived of healthcare so long,"" Shetty said.

Cooperatives: Vishwanath said the government had made it mandatory for all cooperative societies to submit their audit reports. ""The misappropriation of funds is to the tune of 45 crore, while the loss from these societies is only 28 crore. Suitable amendments will be made to the Act to ensure that funds are not misused,"" he remarked.

26,"National pharma policy violates statute, rules HC","BANGALORE: The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday declared that the National Pharmaceutical Policy - 2002 (PP-2002) formulated by the Central Government was arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the Constitution and Essential Commodities Act.

The violation was to the extent of the price control mechanism adopted to determine drugs, under price control which was applicable to essential and life-saving drugs.

Chief Justice N.K. Jaina and V.G. Sabhahit delivered judgment on a writ petition filed by Lt. Col K.S. Gopinath and Dr B.V. Bhaskar of Bangalore, challenging the legality of the National Pharmaceutical Policy â€” 2002 published in February 15.

The petitioners contended that PP-2002 had been framed like business policy and if it were allowed to be enforced, it would take away life-saving and essential drugs out of the ambit of Drug Price Control which is highly detrimental to public interest.

On detailed consideration of rival contentions, the Bench held that it found the PP-2002 arbitrary and unreasonable, and that it violated the Essential Commodities Act (1955) and Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. The violation was to the extent of the price control mechanism adopted in the policy to determine drugs under price control as it defeats the entire purpose of equitable distribution and availability of essential drugs in the basket of drugs under the policy.

Accordingly, the court directed the respondents including the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority to consider and formulate appropriate criteria so as to ensure that essential and life-saving drugs do not fall out of price control.

The court has further directed to review drugs which are essential and life-saving in nature in consultation with the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Until a list of such drugs is prepared and are brought into the basket of essential drugs, the respondents were directed not to implement PP-2002 with regard to Essential and Life Saving drugs for formulation of price control mechanism.

Tandon along with the Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh and T S Krishnamoorty, said that while the first batch of 200 companies will arrive in the state by the November 20 and will be deployed in sensitive areas of the state, the second batch will arrive a week before the actual polling starts.

The EC team earlier also held detailed discussions with the eight district collectors of Saurashtra and Kutch and discussed issues related to peaceful polling. When asked to clarify his statement describing the situation in the state as ''nasty'', Lyngdoh said, ""In Gujarat, violence is occurring everyday, incidents of firing are being reported and relief camps are going without water. If such a situation is not nasty then what else can you call it?""

Speaking about the migrant voters who had fled Gujarat after the Godhra incident, Tandon said that help of the election commissioners of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will be taken to track down these workers.

""We also aim to minimise influence of polling staff on the voters. Thus, the EC has decided to revamp the entire structure by having a mixed staff at polling booths. Out of the four polling staff at each booth only two staffers will be from the district,"" added Tandon.
