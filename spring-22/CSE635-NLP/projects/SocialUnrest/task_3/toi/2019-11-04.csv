0,Shastri hits out at UP govt,"ALLAHABAD: ""Congress will not compromise on the issue of Indira Gandhi Pratishthan land and if need arises we will not hesitate even in toppling the Mayawati government on the same issue,"" said AICC secretary Anil Shastri. Addressing various public meetings during the Congress padyatra from Shivgarh, Soraon to Mau Aima, he said that the state government should give due respect to former prime minister Indira Gandhi as during her regime the Congress sincerely tried to promote the ideology of Dr Ambedkar. He held Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh responsible for the formation of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. Speaking on the occasion, former Union minister Ram Poojan Patel criticised the BSP-BJP coalition government and said that it would be ousted after Diwali. District Congress president Ashok Kumar Bajpayee alleged that people had fed up with the present state government. Prominent among those who addressed the meeting were ex-MLA Ramakant Mishra, Ch Jitendra Nath Singh, Kishore Varshney, Awadh Narain Pandey, Shahid Husain, Mohd Aslam and others. The meeting at Mauaima was conducted by Mukhtarul Haq Ansari.

1,"Amar Singh alleges arrest threat to self, Shivpal","LUCKNOW: Stating that the BSP-BJP government in Uttar Pradesh would not survive after Diwali, national general secretary of Samajwadi Party Amar Singh said plans were afoot to arrest him as also the state general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav.

Singh, who rushed to Lucknow from Delhi following the arrest of two independent MLAs Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya and Dhananjay Singh in the wee hours of Sunday morning, said 203 MLAs had requested governor Vishnukant Shastri in writing to call a special session of the state assembly for a trial of strength. Giving the party-wise break-up of the MLAs, he said they included 142 from the SP, 25 from the Congress, 12 BJP dissidents, 10 independents, 4 of the Rashtriya Kranti Party, 3 of the Apna Dal, 2 of the CPM and 1 each of the Samajwadi Janata Party, Rashtriya Parivartan Dal, National Loktantrik Party, Janata Party and 1-SP supported independent.

Despite the request for a special session, the SP leader said, the governor was refusing to act on it. Had the session been convened the truth of who was in the majority would have become clear, he said. Stating that Shastri was working at the behest of the BJP and the RSS rather than as a constitutional head, he said there was a marked similarity in the statements of Shastri and BJP national president Venkaiah Naidu.

Warning that such suppressive measures would no longer work, the SP leader said the plot of the BJP that it would not allow UP to go out of its hands till the Gujarat elections would come a cropper. Singh said that for the past one week he had been continuously stating that the government would adopt repressive measures against those who dared to raise their voice and his fear was had proved true now. In this connection, he referred to the arrest of the two MLAs and the threat received by him a few days back from a person who had claimed himself to be speaking on behalf of Bagga, though he added the air between him and the chief secretary DS Bagga stood clear.

Referring to the arrest of the two MLAs on the basis of the charges lodged by Puran Singh Bundela, dubbed Mir Jafar, the SP leader said by this yardstick chief minister Mayawati and BJP leaders Lalji Tandon and Vinay Katiyar should also be behind bars as three SP Dalit legislators had stated that they had received allurement of money and threat to life by Mayawati, Tandon and Katiyar.

The SP general secretary hit out at BSP legislator Amarmani Tripathi who he dubbed as a ''child lifter'' but who had now graduated to the status of ''MLA lifter'' and said the services of the same Tripathi were being requisitioned whom the BJP had turned out from the government.

On the imposition of the Gangster''s Act on the two arrested MLAs, Singh said it was ironical that the government now thought it fit to book the two legislators after they had served five years in office under the BJP rule.

He also recalled Vinay Katiyar''s statement on Raja Bhaiyya following the exclusion of his name in the recent cabinet expansion. The SP, he stressed, would not allow this kind of fascism to continue.

In response to a query on who would head the government if the present coalition was thrown out, Amar Singh said by virtue of the SP being the largest party, the choice would devolve on party president Mulayam Singh Yadav.

2,"It's vendetta, say arrested MLAs","LUCKNOW: Allegations and counter-allegationsnotwithstanding, the alleged threat to dissident BJP MLA-turned-loyalist Puran Singh Bundela by Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya and Dhananjay Singh and their subsequent arrest was being marked as a crackdown by the government on those threatening to topple it. The two arrested were being seen as heading the tirade against Mayawati cabinet.

""I was earlier forced and threatened to issue anti-government statements and when finally I refused to oblige, all this happened,"" said Bundela, the BJP MLA from Mehrauni assembly constituency. Bundela insisted that there wasthreat to his life and that of his associates and had no option but to take the help of the police.

For Raja Bhaiyya, it was all a political vendetta. ""We had even earlier expressed apprehensions that we might be framed in false police cases and booked,"" he told Times News Network. ""Lodging of the FIRs against dissident MLAs is the first step of the entire game plan of the government to suppress any movement against its objectionable policies and manner of governance,"" he said adding that the arrest would not limit the movement against Mayawati in any manner.

The second arrested MLA, Dhananjay Singh, openly accused Bundela of playing in the hands of the government. ""In exchange of his switching loyalties back to the BJP leadership, the government has waved off Rs 2.5 crore recovery pending against him from the Forest department,"" Dhananjay alleged. ""In addition, he had been given another Rs 25 lakh from Amarmani Tripathi,"" he added.

""With the government taking such steps to settle political scores, all those preachings of Mayawati on how one should stay away from evils do not seem to ring a bell,"" Dhananjay said as he left for the court from the Hussainganj police station where he was brought later in the evening on Sunday.

3,PM rules out talks with Pak until infiltration stops,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Monday ruled out any talks with Pakistan, asserting it would not serve any purpose as long as that country foments terrorism.

""Till terrorist activities continued, dialogue (with Pakistan) will have no meaning,"" Vajpayee told reporters at the airport before leaving on a five-day visit to Cambodia and Laos.

He was responding to a question on the prospects of resumption of talks with Pakistan and his attending the January Saarc summit in Islamabad in the wake of Sunday''s terrorist strike in south Delhi''s Ansal Plaza.

5,Rights worker seeks ‘arrest insurance’,"JAMSHEDPUR: Why not â€˜arrest insuranceâ€™ ? if crop insurance, accident insurance and travel insurance could become a reality, then why not â€˜arrest insuranceâ€™, argues noted human rights activist of Jharkhand Jawaharlal Sharma.

The demand for such a cover was justified on the merit of a judgement awarded by the Supreme Court in 1993 that any citizen could claim compensation for illegal arrest and detention under Article 21 of the constitution, Sharma said.

The arrest insurance would protect people from the atrocities perpetuated by various quarters including civil administration, police and encourage people to come out in the open to expose corrupt officials, the human rights activist said.

For any wrongful arrest or detention, the insurance cover should have provisions to safeguard the interest of the victims and make erring officials liable for payment of compensation to the aggrieved party, Sharma said.

The insurance cover should be designed in such a way that justice was dispensed strictly within a specific time-frame, Sharma who is making a documentary on the forgotten prisoners languishing in jails said.

To draw wider public attention to this evil in our system, I made an attempt about 17 years ago to make a documentary to portray the pathetic condition of prisoners languishing in jails without trial, Sharma said.

The video documentary which could not be completed mainly due to financial crunch was now in the final stages, Sharma said. The basic idea of producing the film was to sensitise the government about the need to make provisions and laws that would make judiciary accountable and legal practitioners and police punishable for violations.

The experience of Sharma, having been a defender of human rights for over 25 years, was of immense help because he was able to document many such cases where the innocent victims suffered inhuman torture and punished by the law-makers before their trial concluded and judgement pronounced.

Narrating some of the real-life incidents he could able to capture in his camera, Sharma said Rupai Santhal, an old tribal arrested on criminal charges from Singhbhum district in 1947, spent his best 35 years in the prisonerâ€™s ward of Ranchi Mental Hospital without any legal process.

Gomia Ho, another old tribal of Sonua in West Singhbhum district, was arrested on criminal charges and sentenced to jail for three years. Ho was kept in prison for 37 years before he was convicted of the crime, he said. A tribal woman, Mariam Oraon was arrested allegedly for killing her minor child in Latehar district in the early 1950s and forwarded to the prionerâ€™s ward in Ranchi Mental Hospital, where she was kept for 33 years before being convicted by the court for three years.

Similarly, another tribal woman, Nilmoni was implicated in a murder case by her own relatives in the mid 1980s in East Singhbhum district and kept in custody without trial for nine years. Nilmoni, who got married against the wishes of her in-laws, had given birth to a male child in the custody and was acquitted of her charges after nine years following the intervention of human rights groups.

A social worker Raj Inquilab was put behind bars for five years without trial during emergency while leading a farmers movement.

Sharma said most of the jails in the country are over-crowded, four to five times over their permissible capacity and majority of the captives languishing behind bars are waiting for justice for decades.

Even in the event of their acquittal after spending their best years in prison, they are just thrown out in the name of release without any compensation or rehabilitation whatsoever, he said.

6,Nitish Kumar blames state govt for rail dacoities,"PATNA: Railway minister and senior Samata Party leader Nitish Kumar has expressed deep concern over rise in incidence of train dacoities and said that such incidents will have an adverse impact on the development schemes of the railways, including the electrification of the Patna-Gaya line.

Talking to media persons at the airport here on Sunday, Kumar said the railways are unable to control crimes in trains, including train dacoities and loot, as they do not get full cooperation from the state government.

Kumar, along with JD (U) national president and Union food and civil supplies minister Sharad Yadav and former minister and LJP national president Ram Vilas Paswan, reached here from New Delhi on Sunday.

Yadav lamented the poor rate of lifting of rice and wheat in Bihar in comparison to other states for the Centre-sponsored schemes like Antyodaya Anna Yojana, Sampurna Gramin Rojgar Yojana (SGRY) and mid-day meal scheme.

He said preparation of â€œred cardsâ€� for the families below poverty line (BPL) has not yet been completed here. He demanded immediate preparation of such cards in the state. He said that even in Orissa, the offtake of rice and wheat for the Centre-sponsored schemes is poor. But it is not so poor in UP.

A sum of Rs 40,000 crores is spent on these schemes throughout the country. He said that for the BPL families of Bihar, the offtake of rice was 64,000 metric tonnes (MT) against the total allocation of 5.56 lakh MT for the period from April 2001 to March 2002.

Similarly, of the total allocation of 11.64 lakh MT of wheat for the period, the offtake was 3.31 lakh MT, he added.

Under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, the total allocation was 5.62 lakh MT of wheat for the period from April 2002 to August 2003 but only 85,000 MT of the grain was lifted. Against the allocation of 3.87 lakh MT of rice, only 14,000 MT of the grain was lifted, he said.

Both Yadav and Kumar flew to Saharsa from where they will go to Madhepura by road. Kumar will flag off a new train â€” Samastipur-Banmankhi (5529Up/5530Dn) Link Express â€” from the Madhepura railway station. Yadav will be the chief guest at the function, according to JD(U) state general secretary Shiv Prasanna Yadav.

7,Cane price may prove bitter pill for farmers,"PUNE: The state government''s ministerial committee on sugar has deferred its decision to announce revised rates for sugarcane this season. Meanwhile, co-operative banks and factories continue to press for lower rates in view of the drastic fall in the market price of the sweetener.

The ministerial committee, said sources, which met on Saturday under the chairmanship of chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, decided to finalise the price of sugarcane for the new season only after Diwali. Although the sub-committee and the state sugar co-operative factories federation (Sakhar Sangh) have reportedly agreed on a lower rate for cane farmers, the announced was withheld fearing a backlash on the eve of the festival.

The Sakhar Sangh, controlled by NCP president Sharad Pawar, wants further negotiations on the issue because the sugar bowl of Western Maharashtra forms the political base of his party.

According to calculations worked out by the committee in August this year, sugarcane farmers were to get a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 840 per tonne for their produce. This included Rs 180 per tonne spent by factories as harvesting and transportation charges. Of the Rs 660 per tonne to be given to the farmers, the first instalment was to be of Rs 560 and the second of Rs 100. A third instalment was also proposed to cover a rise in sugar prices, if any.

However, the ministerial committee in its latest meeting proposed to give Rs 450 per tonne instead of Rs 560 as the first instalment to cane farmers.

Sources in the state sugar commissionerate said the sharp fall in price of sugar in recent months makes it difficult for the factories to offer Rs 840 as MSP.

Meanwhile, a clutch of big sugar factories also procured an order from the Bombay High court cancelling the release order mechanism followed by the state. The main idea was to sell all their produce in the open market. Under the release order mechanism, the factories were given a fixed quota to be sold in the open market.

The factories, which were jubilant to find that they could take their entire produce to the market, found their joy extremely short-lived. The sugar price, hovering around Rs 1,300 per quintal last year, crashed to Rs 1,050 per quintal this season as consumption increased marginally as compared to available supply.

Thus, with sugar prices going down by almost Rs 250 per quintal, the factories are not in a position to repay their loans for last season. The 40 lakh-quintal surplus sugar stock pledged by them to lending co-operative banks are lying in godowns. In this backdrop, the factories have stated that they are not in a position to approach the banks once again for a big loan to pay high rates to cane growers. The co-operative banks naturally are in no mood to give loans to sugar factories till they repay their loans from the last season. As a result, even financial institutions are supporting a reduced price for cane farmers in the new season.

But the government is making a last ditch effort to give farmers the promised MSP of Rs 840 by approaching Central agencies. The National Bank for Agriculture and Development (Nabard) has agreed to re-finance co-operative banks in case the state stands guarantee.

However, sources said the state is hardly in a position to stand guarantee to Rs 1,700 crore - the amount equivalent to the surplus sugar pledged with the banks. On this backdrop, advisor to finance minister Vijay Kelkar will hold a special meeting with the sugar federation (Sakhar Sangh) at Baramati on Monday to explore a possible solution with Central assistance.

9,Governor not discharging his responsibilities: Top SC lawyer,"LUCKNOW: â€œGovernor Vishnukant Shastri, instead of discharging his responsibilities as a constitutional head of the state, was behaving more like a primary school teacher. He has no moral right to prove the majority of the government. Assembly is the proper place where the strength of the government can be tested.â€� These views were expressed by senior Supreme Court advocate PC Srivastava while commenting on the prevailing murky political scenario in the state.

Lambasting speaker of the assembly Kesharinath Tripathi, Srivastava said that he (Tripathi) had saved the Kalyan Singh government by sheer manipulation as his decision was an attack on the democratic values.

â€œGovernor Vishnukant Shastri is playing in the hands of Union home minister LK Advani while the latterâ€™s one point programme is to root out value-based politics,â€� alleged Srivastava. â€œAdvani calls himself an iron man like Sardar Patel while the reality is otherwise. I brought all these facts before Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee but no action has been taken as yet,â€� complained Srivastava.

Srivastava said that he was supporting the formation of the Samajawadi Party government in UP because the arithmetic was in Mulayam Singhâ€™s favour and the SP government would be the only alternative to the BSP-BJP government.

â€œIt is quite unfortunate that chief minister Mayawati, who knows me personally as I had pleaded her case in the Supreme Court, is spreading a canard that I am being fielded as a SP candidate for the Rajya Sabha seat and that is why I am launching a tirade against her government,â€� he said adding that the fact was that he was not even a primary member of the SP.

Strongly disapproving the repressive measures taken by the Mayawati government against legislators Raja Bhaiyya and Dhanajay Singh, Srivastava said that Mayawati and Lalji Tandon were misusing the government machinery against their political opponents. â€œIn a democracy, the role of the opposition is far more important than that of a government and the present repressive measures being adopted against the opposition MLAs would boomerang against the government,â€� he cautioned. Taking exception to the role being played by governor Shastri, Srivastava said that he would call on President APJ Abdul Kalam and request him to remove Shastri from the post of governor and appoint Mulayam Singh Yadav as chief minister to uphold democratic values.

10,Raja Bhaiyya's arrest message to musclemen,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawatiâ€™s decision to arrest high-profile MLAs Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya and Dhanjay Singh has sent a positive message across the state that the â€œmuscle-flexing politiciansâ€� are in for a trouble now.

The two politicians were picked up in the early hours on Sunday following a complaint filed by BJP MLA Puran Singh Bundela for allegedly trying to terrorise legislators and extract their support for the dissidents who are virtually on a war with the state BJP leadership. Such complaints were not new against Raja Bhaiyya but no one had the guts to arrest him in the past, said an official.

After their arrest the government admitted that both the MLAs were involved in criminal activities for a long time but could not be arrested due to political and criminal influences. But once a complaint was lodged against them by Bundela, prompt action was taken against them, said a spokesman of the home department. This action, said an official, may open old cases against Raja Bhaiyya and Dhananjay Singh, till now buried in the government files.

On many occasions the government felt that complaints against Raja Bhaiyya should be pursued in right earnest. But in spite of repeated pleas made by officials at the state headquarters, the district officials ignored the requests, said an official.

Then came the era of BJPâ€™s dependence on independent MLAs and splinter groups for the survival of its ministry and Raja Bhaiyyaâ€™s stature grew. The breaking of ties between the BJP and the BSP under Kalyan Singh in the late nineties put Raja Bhaiyya in an enviable position. Even Kalyan Singh, who had vowed to teach Raja Bhaiyya a lesson, had to defend him in public in return for support from the Kunda MLA.

11,BJP to apprise non-resident Gujaratis about polls through Net,"AHMEDABAD: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has activated a small group of computer-savvy workers to execute a plan to approach non-resident Gujaratis through e-mails and apprise them about the assembly elections, to be held on December 12.

The move comes close on the heels of a recent visit by a delegation of state Congress leaders to the USA, where they apprised the Gujarati expatriates about the post-riot situation and urged them not to send donations either to the BJP or VHP.

Through e-mails, the group will contact NRGs and members of organisations, like the ''Friends of BJP'' and the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, whose e-mail addresses are being updated.

""We have around 2 lakh e-mail addresses and all of them will be given a special message on the scenario in Gujarat for the assembly elections,"" said one leader.

A senior functionary of the party, associated with the election work, said that the party has also decided to establish contact with ''Friends of BJP'', which has a large membership in America. The members of this pro-Hindu Gujarati organisation will in turn request their friends and relatives in Gujarat to help the BJP in the elections.

""The Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh and other Hindu organisations will also be told about the Gaurav Yatra, led by Chief Minister Narendra Modi and state BJP chief Rajendrasinh Rana, which has been a precursor to the formal election campaign of the party. Once a clear picture emerges, the party will give details about the candidates contesting the elections.

These details will also be fed for election data update for the party''s website www.bjpguj.org. The state BJP unit has also decided to avail services of IT professionals to organise a hi-tech campaign by the end of this month.

A big delegation from Friends of BJP had visited Gujarat during the last assembly election. They had canvassed for BJP and former chief minister Keshubhai Patel. Though the party will contact Madhu Upadhyay, president of this organisation, but it is not certain whether this time also they will come down to canvass for the December 12 polls.

The election, fought in the backdrop of the Godhra massacre and the ensuing riots, has aroused great curiosity among BJP sympathisers settled in America and other European nations. The BJP will keep them posted about the political developments after active campaigning is launched in the state.
