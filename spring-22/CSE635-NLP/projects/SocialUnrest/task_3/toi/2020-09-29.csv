1,Modi govt files for retrial,"AHMEDABAD: Following the stinging Supreme Court indictment of the shoddy handling of the Best Bakery trial by the state government in the Vadodara fast-track court and the flimsy appeal filed in the Gujarat High Court earlier, the state government on Monday filed an amended criminal appeal in the HC seeking retrial.

In response, the Division Bench of DK Trivedi and MS Shah ordered that bailable warrants of Rs 10,000 each be issued against the 21 persons acquitted by the fast-track court on June 27 in the case pertaining to the massacre of 14 people last year. The court also directed the DGP of Gujarat to file an affidavit by October 9 for giving protection to witnesses who desire to give their statements and evidence before the appropriate court.

The appeal comes at a time when the Modi government is showcasing the state as an epitome of peace to NRIs and investors, and there could not have been a more opportune moment for the government to give effect to â€˜raj dharmaâ€™. It had time till October 9 to appeal. The government, which had earlier tried to project such acquittals as being common in most trials of communal riots across the country, had to backtrack after the Supreme Court minced no words in saying the state government should quit if it could not perform its â€˜raj dharmaâ€™.

Interestingly, the appeal comes a day after the Vadodara police decided to treat as official the statements before the media by the estranged sister-inlaw of Best Bakery complainant Zahira Shaikh, Yasminbano. Yasminbano told the media that Zahira had lied and had changed her statement after taking money. She maintains that the 21 accused, who were later acquitted, were â€œinnocentâ€� and that the 14 persons who were killed, â€œdied of suffocationâ€�.

The application requested that the affidavits of four witnesses be produced on record and further evidence be permitted to be recorded by those witnesses, even as it called for earlier proceedings to be quashed. Contrary to the earlier appeal, which the apex court had severely criticised saying that even a lawyer with a yearâ€™s experience would have done better, this time around advocate general SN Shelat put the petition before the HC and sought a retrial. Says human rights lawyer Girish Patel, â€œThe government was not interested in challenging the acquittal order. But for the SC hearing Zahiraâ€™s case, they would not have done it.â€�

He said what remained to be seen was how the case seeking retrial was argued when it came up for hearing on December 1. The four witnesses whose testimonies the state sought to take on record were injured in the Best Bakery massacre and had escaped to Uttar Pradesh, while one of the witnesses, Shazaad Khan Pathan, was not produced before the fast-track court on the ground that â€œhe was mentally unstableâ€�.

The court, while passing a detailed order in the matter, has allowed a miscellaneous criminal application to produce the affidavits of four witnesses on record and permit further evidence to be recorded by those witnesses. The trial court was directed to prepare a â€œa record of all the important documentsâ€� of the case and send it to the registry of the High Court on or before November 15.

Further hearing of the case has been fixed for December 1. Of the 73 witnesses examined by the fast-track court, 37 turned hostile in the case where 14 persons were burnt on the night of March 1 and 2 last year in the Best Bakery premises in Vadodara. Zahira Bibi, Saira Habibullah Sheikh, Shahzad Khan Hasan and Mohammad Ashrat Sheikh were the witnesses who were declared hostile and have now filed affidavits before the SC.

4,NHRC to probe suicide by Karnataka farmer's kin,"NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked its special rapporteur K R Venugopal to conduct an on-the-spot inquiry into the mass suicide by a family of six members in Karnatakaâ€™s Koppal district after a complaint by former MP Kodanda Ramaiah and others.

Venugopal has been asked to submit his report within four weeks. In his complaint, Ramaiah pointed out that Karnataka is facing drought for the third year in succession due to the failure of the monsoon.

Though there were reports that about 150 farmers committed suicide every year in the last three years because of their inability to repay loans they had taken, the complainants alleged that the government had not waived the interest or postponed the recoveries.

6,Reliance out of gas pipeline policy ambit,"NEW DELHI: The government will retain monopoly in building and operating pipelines for carrying gas but will allow all users equal access, according to the draft policy for infrastructure. Oil minister Ram Naik on Monday said proposals already approved would be exempted from its ambit.

This is good news for Reliance Industries, which has approval for constructing a pipeline to carry gas from its find off the Andhra coast to Gujarat and Maharashtra.

The draft policy nominated gas utility Gail India as the monopoly builder of cross-country gas pipelines. Any producer will have the right to sell gas within 100 km of its facilities â€” either gas field or import terminal -â€” to consumers directly and lay pipeline for this purpose.

7,AHD minister irked over land acquisition,"PATNA: The government''s decision to acquire the land of the Bihar State Fishery Development Corporation (BSFDC) for the construction of the Central government-sponsored AIIMS-type hospital has sparked a row.

Junior animal husbandry minister Md Javed has raised serious objections to the land acquisition decision. ""It will badly affect fishery,"" a source in the animal husbandry department (AHD) quoted the junior minister as mentioning in his ""buff sheet'''' sent to his senior.

The minister, in his letter, has indirectly blamed the state government for ""ignoring'''' the economic interests of a poor section of society associated with fishery. ""The fish hatchery situated on the proposed hospital site is the only source of spawn for the people associated with fishery,"" the minister mentions in the letter while seeking a plot of 50 acres for a hatchery in the vicinity of Patna. ""The fishery development programme in the state will be very badly hit.

The decision may lead to a sharp decline in the production of different varieties of spawn in the coming five years,'''' says the letter. The letter further says that the ""Brooder variety'''' of fish is produced in the present hatchery. ""The AHD won''t be able to produce the ''Brooder variety'' at a new place. Bihar will go back by at least five years in fishery.''''

The land acquisition decision shows lack of proper coordination as the government did not take consent of the department concerned before making the acquisition announcement, the letter says. Interestingly, the junior minister does admit the hospital project is a major step for the state''s development. Despite repeated attempts the minister could not be contacted.

8,"SAS: Limited options before council, govt","MANGALORE: The Mangalore City Corporation will have to implement Self Assessment Scheme (SAS) for property tax in toto, otherwise the only options left before the state government are either dissolution of the council or to amend the Act for the sake of one civic body in the state.

A source, who is familiar with SAS, said the only discretionary powers given to the city corporation is to decide on the rate of taxation -- between 0.3 to 0.6 per cent -- and nothing else.

The source added that if the corporation refuses to implement it the state can dissolve the house and appoint an administrator, which would be extreme -- but cannot be ruled out.

The Mangalore City Corporation on Friday, by passing a unanimous resolution against implementation of Self Assessment Scheme (SAS) for property tax in the city, became the first civic body in the state to defy the state government''s directive on SAS.

This move has not only embarrassed the government, but the fact that KPCC President Janardhan Poojary himself asked the corporator to veto SAS, has made things unpalatable. The government is in a fix how to deal with the situation as it cannot take disciplinary action against the corporators -- as Poojary is the KPCC president.

Due to this reason, the state government is treading with caution regarding taking action on the corporation and corporators.

When contacted, Urban Development Minister D K Shivakumar, told The Times of India from Bangalore that no city corporation has the powers to reject SAS. ""It is a law and there is no question to reject it.""

When told him that the Mangalore City Corporation has already rejected it and what action the state would take, he said he said action part warranted a proper look at the facts, like why the corporation has rejected it and so on, before he could make a comment.

What the state government can do if the city corporation follows the old system of tax collection instead of SAS, Shivakumar avoided answering it directly and said he had confidence that Mangloreans would appreciate the fairness of the system and would implement it.

When brought to his notice the recent SAS notification by his department, which had excluded Bangalore, Shivakumar said as Bangalore corporation came under the jurisdiction of the chief minister, the advertisement released by his department pertained to areas which were under his control.

When reminded that KPCC President Janardhan Poojary had told corporators to reject SAS at the corporation''s special council meeting, Shivakumar said everybody was entitled to his opinion.

""But finally it is the state government they support,"" he added.

Meanwhile, sources said that the Mayor K Divakar has readied to fire his salvo in case the state government plans to cut grants to the corporation. The first thing, he would do if grants are cut is stop paying salaries to the employees.

Delivering his presidential address on the ''World Heart Day'' organised by Omega Hospital, he added that quality health care has not yet reached the poor sections of the society due to the high cost and integrity of the system.

10,'Shah escaped MCOCA due to flaws in evidence',"MUMBAI: Film financier Bharat Shah was given the benefit of doubt and let off under MCOCA as there were a few flaws in the evidence, says Public Prosecutor Rohini Salian.

""I have to respect the court''s order. I''ll have to read the judgement, his observations

on each and every count, what made him to let Shah off on MCOCA and only if I feel that

the state is aggrieved, will I challenge it. But I can''t say anything before reading it,"" Salian told the Times News Network.

Among the four accused, Judge A P Bhangale convicted three of them and acquitted one. ""He has held accused number one Nasim Rizvi and accused number two Rahim Allah Baksh guilty under MCOCA and other offences; and he has held accused number three, Bharat Shah, guilty under IPC 118 (read with section 383 and 387). He has acquitted accused number four, Ahmed Shamsuddin alias Bhatija.""

The sentence will be pronounced on Wednesday.

There were a few flaws in the evidence to prove Shah guilty under MCOCA because of which he was given the benefit of doubt, she said.

""One, in the panchnama, one portion is missing while it was being retrieved from the computer though it was there in the tape; two, minor contradictions in the panchnama and three, the labels bearing the signature of the panchas were not sent back from the Central Forensic Laboratory and such other minor flaws.""

She added, ""Right from the beginning, Shah has admitted to his voice in the tape for

mediating on behalf of the victims of extortion even till the time he went to the

Supreme Court for his bail. But now that he has got defence, and it is his choice, he

has denied it. That also helped him.""

Salian feels that witnesses turning hostile also went to Shah''s benefit.

Without taking names but obviously referring to the film stars who turned hostile in the case, she said, ""It is the case of those hostile witnesses. They were aggrieved parties, they had

gone to the police with complaints, but they chose to turn hostile in the court. That means, they have not helped themselves. They had an occasion to tell facts to the court but they did not utilise it. With this attitude of the witnesses, they are indirectly facilitating the underworld.""

On being queried whether she was happy with the verdict, Salian said, ""As a prosecutor, I am neither happy nor sad. My duty is to present it in the court. I am supposed to help the cause of justice. But when I lose a good case, I feel bad for people who are aggrieved. But in this case the aggrieved people themselves chose to turn hostile"".

The state education ministry made all the right kind of noises at a session to showcase higher education in its new corporate avatar as part of the â€˜Vibrant Gujarat: Global Investorsâ€™ Summitâ€™. Six MoUs worth Rs 200 crore were also inked during the session.

15,Farmers protest against anti-farmer policies of govt,"CHANDIGARH: Farmers across Punjab blocked rail and road traffic on Tuesday as part of their protest against the ""anti-farmer"" policies of the Central and state governments.

The situation turned violent at Bhai Bakhtaur village in Bathinda after five protesting farmers were hit by a goods train during the blockade of railway traffic there and were injured seriously. One of them, Gurdev Singh (58), died later. The agitating farmers beat up the driver and the lineman and started an ''indefinite'' dharna on the tracks.

This disrupted all traffic on the busy Ferozepur-Delhi rail route. Road traffic between Bathinda and Mansa was also disrupted by the farmers.

In Ludhiana rail traffic was blocked for more than three hours in the Ludhiana section of the Ferozepur division of northern railways with trains being held up at Doraha, Sirhind, Dhuri and Mullanpur, though most of the passenger trains on the Ludhiana-Moga-Ferozepur route left before the blockade began.

He said that all the procurement agencies have been directed to ensure smooth operation to facilitate the farmers in sale of their produce.

17,"Hanspal, Hooda seek NDA govt's removal","CHANDIGARH: It was a day of protests for the Congress on Tuesday. The party units of Punjab and Haryana, led by their respective state Congress presidents, submitted memoranda to the governors seeking the immediate dismissal of the NDA government at the Centre.

The district Congress units also held protests focusing on the ""failure of the NDA government on all fronts"".

While a delegation of the Punjab Congress, led by its chief H S Hanspal, met governor O P Verma, the Haryana Congress delegation, led by its president Bhajan Lal, presented a memorandum to governor Babu Parmanand. Both urged the governors to send the memoranda to President A P J Kalam.

It was more or less a ritual as the party high command has directed the state units to submit memoranda and hold rallies to highlight the ""failure"" of the NDA government. It appeared strange that the Congress was seeking the dismissal of the union government after it had lost the ""no-confidence motion"" which harped on almost the same charges.

The Punjab Congress delegation included cabinet ministers Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, Jagjit Singh and Jagmohan Singh Kang, while the Haryana Congress delegation comprised CLP leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and former minister Raghuvir Singh Kadian.

The memorandum pointed out that the NDA government had ""failed to protect"" the life, property and honour of the people during its rule and the unity and integrity of the country had been ""under threat"" from a continuous proxy war from Pakistan.

The memorandum also focused on economy, which was""worst-hit"", and said that economic growth, especially agricultural growth, had ""crashed"".

The memorandum said that the Centre had ""undermined"" the authority of the CBI by ""exerting political pressure"" on it to drop the name of deputy Prime Minister L K Advani from the chargesheet in the Babri Masjid demolition case.

Jalandhar: The Congress on Tuesday held a rally attacking the BJP-led NDA government for having failed to protect the life and property of the people of the country.

The district Congress leaders, including MP Balbir Singh, parliamentary secretary Gurbinder Atwal, among others, pointed out that the Gujarat riots following the Godhra carnage, including the killing of innocent people in the Best Bakery episode, had totally shattered the confidence of the people.

""When the whole of Gujarat was burning, the Central government had given a clean chit to the Gujarat government,"" said Atwal. Distributing copies of the chargesheet against the NDA government the district Congress leaders said the NDA government was jeopardising the countryâ€™s defence.

""The NDA government had wrecked the social harmony in the country by not punishing the guilty in the Best Bakery case,"" they said, adding that the government was subverting the secular character of education by saffronising it. In Jalandhar about 500 people had gathered for the Congress rally.

Faridkot: Hundreds of Congress party workers led by district party president Surinder Iqbal Singh took out a protest march here against the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre demanding its immediate dismissal.

The protesters submitted a memorandum to the commissioner, Faridkot division, to be forwarded to the President of India.

Addressing the party workers, Surinder Iqbal said that as the Vajpayee-led coalition government had failed to protect the life, property and honour of the people of India, they had lost the moral right to rule the country.

Hoshiarpur: The district Congress committee, on Tuesday, held a protest rally against the functioning of the NDA government opposite the Income Tax office. The speakers, including health minister Romesh Dogra and DCC president Kuldip Nanda, lamented at the Central government''s step-motherly treatment towards Punjab. Dogra said that the NDA was indulging in anti-farmer policies and for this Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had to sit on a dharna along with farmers sometime ago in Delhi.

18,Violence erupts after farmer run over by train,"BATHINDA: The blockade of rail and road traffic by eight farmers'' organisation near Bhai Bhaktaur village in Bathinda, on Tuesday, turned violent after five farmers were allegedly hit by a train.

One of them, Gurdev Singh (58), succumbed to his injuries in the Civil Hospital, Bathinda.

As five of the farmers sitting on dharna on Ferozepur-Delhi railway line sustained serious injuries after they were allegedly hit by a goods train, the agitating farmers beat up the train drivers and a lineman, and started an indefinite dharna on the railway track.

The farmers alleged that the driver did not stop the train at the dharna point and tried to run it over the protesting farmers as a conspiracy had been hatched between the railway authorities and a police officer to foil the dharna.

Countering the allegations, police and railway authorities said that it was negligence on part of a point man who by mistake gave the signal of line clearance to the train driver. The farmers, however, alleged that the point man was under the influence of liquor at the time of the incident.

Though the farmers organisation had plans of blocking the traffic from 12 pm to 3 pm at four points in Bathinda, all farmers after 3 pm assembled at Bhai Bhaktaur blockade point and started an indefinite dharna.

As the farmers'' organisation declined to move the goods train from the spot, all traffic on the busy Ferozepur-Delhi rail route and road traffic on Bathinda-Mansa road was disrupted.

Apprehending that the agitation could turn violent, a large number of policemen armed with batons and guards were deputed at the railway crossing.

Though many senior officers were camping at the spot to reach a compromise with the farmers, all efforts yielded no result.

Sources said the district administration was under tremendous pressure to end the blockade. But did not want to use police force as that could bring the farmers in direct confrontation with the state government.

Meanwhile, farmers leaders demanded registration of attempt of murder case against three railway employees (two drivers and the point man) and Ashutosh, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) who was deputed at the spot to maintain law and order. They also demanded Rs two lakh as compensation for the injured farmers.

Additional deputy commissioner K P Brar reached the spot in the evening to effect a compromise but by the time of filing this report no compromise had been reached.

The injured farmers have been identified as Dula Singh (65), Mukhtiar Singh (70), Surjit Singh and Nath Singh. All injured have been admitted at Civil Hospital, Bathinda.
