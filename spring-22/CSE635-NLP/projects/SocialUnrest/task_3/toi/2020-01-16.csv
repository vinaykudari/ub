0,Row over mayor's tenure will be resolved: State govt,"PATNA: Urban development secretary Ajay Kumar told the Patna High Court on Wednesday that the state government would bring in a new Act for the urban local bodies as per the model supplied by the Central government, resolving the controversy regarding mayor''s tenure.

Or necessary amendment will be made in the existing Patna Municipal Corporation Act, 1951, in the light of the 74th amendment in the Constitution, Kumar added.

Earlier, the Patna High Court expressed its deep concern over the inordinate delay made in the appointment of chief executive officers (CEOs) in the five Municipal Corporations of Patna, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Gaya and Bhagalpur, even as one and a half years had passed since the the three-tier Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) had been formed.

Allowing two weeks'' time to the state government to submit action taken report in the matter, a division bench, comprising Chief Justice (CJ) Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Rajendra Prasad, asked Kumar, present in the court, to explain why the CEOs had not been appointed as per Section 50 of the said Act in consultation with the mayors concerned and the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC).

The bench also asked him to explain why the tenures of a mayor and a deputy mayor, despite 74th amendment in the Constitution, were only for one year, whereas the period of a municipal corporation had been fixed at five years. The CJ observed that failure to achieve devolution of powers to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) by the state government, even after more than one year of the elections and nine years of the relevant constitutional amendment, was a violation of the Constitution.

Hearing on an intervener petition, filed jointly by five mayors â€” Krishna Murari Yadav (Patna), Samir Kumar (Muzaffarpur), Om Prakash Kheria (Darbhanga), Asha Devi (Gaya) and Kehkesha Parween (Bhagalpur), the bench directed that a notice be issued to the state government.

The petitioners had requested the court to issue an order to the respondents concerned (state government and others) asking them to remove the present administrative officers working as CEO in all the five municipal corporations, as they had been appointed before the elections of the municipal corporations and municipalities held in 2002.

The petitioners also requested the court that an executive officer be appointed under the guidelines of statutory provision of Section 50 of the Act for the proper functioning of their own and that of the local self governments in keeping with the Constitution.

The petitioners asked the court if the action of the respondents concerned in not removing the executive officers â€” who were not appointed as per the provisions of the Act and who had not been cooperating with the elected members of the said municipal corporations â€” in the state was â€œunjust, uncontrolled and arbitraryâ€�.

Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, lawyer M P Gupta, assisted by Rabindra Kumar, submitted before the bench that central grants of Rs 40 crore, meant for Slum Area Development Scheme and Swarna Jayanti Urban Employment Scheme, had lapsed during last three years. Standing counsel S Alamdar Hussain appeared for the state government.

1,Procurement of foodgrains may kick off another row,"PATNA: The procurement of foodgrains by purchase centres of Food Corporation of India (FCI) is likely to kick off another row between the Centre and the state government.

According to the state food and civil supplies department, the FCI purchase centres in Bihar had procured only 1535 metric tons of paddy and 79 metric tons of rice till January 14.

Around 100 FCI purchase centres have been made operational since November 15 last year. The state department claims that out of 100 FCI purchase centres, only 26 have procured foodgrains from farmers of Bihar. â€œThe rest 74 centres have not purchased foodgrains from farmers at all and are only running on paper,â€� remarked food and civil supplies minister Pooranmasi Ram.

Ram threatened to lodge FIRs against FCI officials of the 74 centres who have failed to procure any foodgrains from farmers. â€œThey (the FCI) are making fool of the farmers of the state and rejecting foodgrain on fictitious ground. Even good paddy, having a brown cover, is being rejected by them,â€� the minister alleged.

He sated that due to FCIâ€™s negative attitude the farmers of Bihar were being forced to sale their products on distress prices. The FCI officials have apparently an order from the Centre to reject foodgrains produced by farmers of Bihar, he asserted.

3,State govt angry over civil surgeons not sacking staff,"PATNA: The state government has taken strong exception to the failure of majority of civil surgeons to comply with its directive to sack by December 31, 2002 all those Class III and IV employees of the health department who were appointed in an irregular manner since January 1, 1980.

The government has threatened to remove all such civil surgeons from their posts by March/April if they failed to remove such employees latest by February 28.

Health commissioner Ashok Kumar Chaudhary, in a communication to all the civil surgeons on January 8, directed them to remove all illegally appointed employees under their respective jurisdiction after serving show cause notices on them. He has warned the civil surgeons that the department would take disciplinary action and initiate departmental proceedings against them if they failed to comply with the July 9, 2002, order of the chief secretary and November 5, 2002, order of the health commissioner in this regard. The additional secretary, health, C K Anil, had sent a similar directive to civil surgeons on December 5 last year.

Chaudhary has said that information reaching the state headquarters from the districts had made it clear that majority of the civil surgeons had failed to comply with the government directive under pressure from health employees'' unions. Let alone removing the illegally appointed employees, majority of civil surgeons had failed to even identify such employees due to pressure from employees'' unions, Chaudhary said. This attitude is not only highly unfortunate but was also a reflection on the administrative anarchy which prevailed in the health administration, the health commissioner observed in his letter to civil surgeons.

Referring to the meeting convened by CM Rabri Devi on November 27 last to review the functioning of the health department, the health commissioner informed civil surgeons that the chief minister had directed the health authorities to fix responsibility if civil surgeons did not comply with the government order in this regard.

Chaudhary told TNN on Wednesday that the department had banned the transfer of Class III and IV employees till all the employees allegedly appointed in an irregular manner were removed. He admitted that the department had received complaints that some civil surgeons that recently transferred several employees within the district. The government was looking into the matter, he said.

Sources in the department said that about 2,000 persons are estimated to have been appointed in an irregular manner.

The additional health secretary had clearly informed civil surgeons that their failure to comply with the government order would be tantamount to their alleged involvement in these appointments. When contacted, the director-in-chief, health services, Dr Anil Kumar, said that none of the civil surgeons had so far complied with the government directive in toto. Some of them had complied with the order partially, he said.

4,UP govt forks out Rs 1.3 cr for Mayawati's birthday,"LUCKNOW: Who will foot the bill for chief minister Mayawati''s birthday bash? The UP government is learnt to have sought Rs 1.35 crore from the State Contingency Fund (SCF) to pay for the celebrations on Wednesday at the La Martiniere College grounds here.Brushing aside the Opposition''s allegations of wasteful expenditure, Mayawati celebrated her 48th birthday in style by cutting a 51 kg cake in the presence of Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Kanshi Ram, senior BJP leader Lalji Tandon, BSP ministers, MPs, MLAs and thousands of party supporters who braved the chilly weather.

Unfazed by the Opposition''s attack on the celebrations and the fund collection preceding it, Mayawati declared that her birthday would be celebrated every year as ''fund-raising day'' by party workers. She also declared that her birthday celebrations were being organised by the government, to which the opposition parties have taken serious exception. Earlier, highly-placed sources told this paper that the finance department was forced to grant permission for the withdrawal of Rs 1.35 crore from the state''s contingency fund for bearing the expenses.

Interestingly, the permission was granted on Tuesday itself but no department was willing to give the essentiality certificate required to release the amount. Ideally, the cultural department should have issued the certificate but it backed out at the last minute. Finally, another department, headed by the chief minister, agreed to issue the certificate to bail out the state government.

5,Transport ministers to meet on Thursday,"NEW DELHI: The Union and state transport ministers will meet here on Thursday to discuss, among other things, a proposal to tighten the rules on inspection and fitness tests on existing vehicles, including private ones.

""Tightening of emission norms, improvement of auto fuel and improvement in vehicle technology will not be enough to arrest pollution, especially in urban areas,"" says the official proposal. ""The emission of in-use vehicles has, therefore, emerged as a major area of concern, especially as the number of vehicles is likely to witness an explosive growth in the foreseeable future.""

All vehicles are required to prove their fitness at the time of first registration. After that, only commercial vehicles are required to return after two years for an annual check. Private ones are required to return for a check only after 15 years. They get a fitness clearance for five years at a time.

Not only is this not enough, the inspection also needs strengthening, says the proposal. It is only visual inspection done by poorly trained personnel, lacking equipment. The on-road enforcements are also weak.

The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has suggested that a committee with representation from different agencies, including manufacturers, supervise the installation and operation of testing facilities, with a code of operation practices to cover all vehicles. The states could invite applications from testing agencies worldwide to run an authorised certification centre.

A related proposal is to raise the road tax on older vehicles, to give people an incentive to phase them out.

The ministers will discuss these issues on Thursday and how much or fast to proceed. The Centre''s suggestion is to begin by encouraging SIAM to first set up a model inspection centre in each of the seven big cities.

Another issue on the agenda is a reform of taxation on tourist vehicles, with permits being issued like the national permits for goods'' carriages, or, alternatively for issuing distinctive vehicle stickers on agreed rates applicable across the states. Tourist transporters say they face a lot of harassment on these counts.

There are also proposals on changing the rules on checking overloading of cargo vehicles and rationalisation of road tax which varies from state to state. As for overloading, the Union transport ministry says this is a big problem and ""a sense of complacency seems to be prevailing in the trucking industry. Operators seems to believe it is possible to get away with any amount of overloading"". The meet will discuss enforcement of the rules and some changes suggested to make it more effective.

The Centre is also trying to get the states to agree to a common term (such as 15 years) for a one-time vehicle tax for non-transport ones. Some states offer an option between this and an annual payment, some for only certain categories of vehicles and some make it dependent on the vehicle''s age.

7,UK asks J&K separatists to denounce violence,"SRINAGAR: Britain on Thursday asked the separatist leadership in Jammu and Kashmir to denounce violence in all its manifestations and join the political mainstream for restoration of peace in the state.

""I have to say that those parties that did not take part in the elections held last October missed an important opportunity to establish their democratic credentials and advance the political process,"" British High Commissioner to India Sir Rob Young said after an hour-long meeting with Hurriyat leaders at its headquarters here.

""I think they will be giving serious consideration as to how they can contribute to the political process here,"" he said.

Welcoming the Centre''s decision to open a dialogue with the representatives of the people of Kashmir and other groups and the state government''s response to it, Young said, ""we believe people in Jammu and Kashmir want peace and prosperity and return to a normal life.""

Congratulating the Centre for holding free and fair Assembly elections under difficult conditions, he said it was remarkable that so many people came out to contest the polls and cast their vote. ""I do not think militancy has achieved anything in the state over the last 12 years except for personal misery and economic degradation.""

""We do not think violence can achieve anything. We in the Britain and in other countries in the west denounce terrorism in all its forms. It cannot be the way forward and the only way forward is through a dialogue and a democratic process,"" he said.

8,VHP demands arrest of US missionary,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The VHP''s Kerala unit on Thursday demanded the ""arrest and prosecution"" of the American missionary Joseph Cooper, now under treatment in a hospital here for injuries suffered in Monday''s attack on a team of evangelists at Kilimanur, for alleged violation of the Foreigners'' Act.

In a statement here, VHP state organising secretary Kummanam Rajasekharan asked the state government to initiate prosecution proceedings against Cooper for ""carrying out religious propaganda after coming to the country on a visiting visa.""

Besides, Cooper and his team of evangelists ""slandered"" the Hindu dharma and traditions and sought to convert the residents of a scheduled caste colony by allurement and compulsory means, he alleged.

""According to the Foreigners Act of 1956, foreigners visiting the country should not engage themselves in religious preaching. They are only supposed to do sight-seeing and visit relatives,"" he said.

While terming the Kilimanur incident ""deplorable"", Rajasekharan said RSS workers were being ""hunted by police"" and being falsely linked to a case in which ""they have no involvement.""

The Kilimanur incident also pointed to the need to draw up a code of conduct for religious preachings in the state, he added.
