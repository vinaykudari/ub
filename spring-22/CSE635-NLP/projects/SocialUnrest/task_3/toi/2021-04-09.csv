0,Water likely to arrest Verma's depleting margin,"DHANDHUKA: â€œBandhuke devi, pan Dhandhuke no deviâ€� (Shoot your daughters rather than marrying them off to Dhandhuka). This saying best explains the degree of water crisis in this region. And water has always played a major role in deciding electoral fortunes in this part of the state.

Little wonder then that the BJP leaders are all smiles. The water problem has been solved to some extent after the region started getting water under the Mahi-Pariyej scheme from January 2000. â€œThere have been over 1,000 community marriages in the entire region since January 2000,â€� says Dhandhuka MLA Bharat Pandya.

The residents echo Pandyaâ€™s sentiments. â€œWe used to get water every seven days. And the quality of water was brackish which created a lot of health problems for us. Now, however, we get water every three days and most importantly the quality is very good,â€� says Mukesh Chauhan,who runs a medical store in Vallabhipur.

Besides, the BJP workers are hoping that the â€˜Atal effectâ€™ will help them fight the strong anti-incumbency factor that their candidate and five-time MP Ratilal Verma is facing. The nervousness in the BJP camp is not without reason.

Vermaâ€™s lead has been consistently fallingâ€”in 1999, he won by just over 5,000 votes. However, Verma believes that his party will fight anti-incumbency by projecting â€˜branch Vajpayeeâ€™. He is also hopeful that results in the assembly polls 2002 bettered his chances.

â€œLast time, the margin had come down because Dholka, Bavla and Viramgam assembly seats were with the Congress. But the BJP managed to wrest these seats in the last elections and hence the picture will be different this time. Besides, the â€˜Atal effectâ€™ will work to our advantage,â€� says Verma.

On the other hand, former minister and Congress candidate for the seat Yogendra Makwana is confident that they will counter the false campaign of the BJP.

â€œOur main poll plank will be Vermaâ€™s non performance. As far as drinking water is concerned, we will tell people that the MP has done very little in the long tenure that he has enjoyed in Delhi,â€� says Makwana.

According to him, sarpanchs from many villages like Detroj have written a strong letter to Verma expressing their displeasure over his performance. Makwana had, however, contested on an NCP ticket in the last Lok Sabha polls but did not fare well. â€œI changed my mind and did not want to contest. I wanted to withdraw my candidature but I could not do it before the EC deadline,â€� says Makwana.

However, Congressmen say that Makwanaâ€™s selection as candidate has made former MLA Gunwant Makwana and Shailesh Parmar inactive. The Congress as well as the BJP believe that as the seat is a reserved one, the caste factor is not as important as in other places.

1,'No Rabri govt dismissal',"PATNA: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Thursday made it clear that the NDA would not dismiss the RJD government in Bihar even if the former was returned to power at the Centre in the elections.

""The Constitution did not provide for dismissal of a state government on the ground of non-governance. The people of Bihar would themselves have to take a decision on removing the RJD government,"" he said.

Advani, however, justified the imposition of President''s rule in Bihar in 1999, saying on that occasion the Centre had enough grounds to invoke Article 356 of the Constitution.

2,"'Suicide' case: Parents, in-laws trade charges","MOHALI: Tempers ran high at the civil hospital when the in-laws of Nisha Chawla, who allegedly committed suicide on Tuesday morning, came to take her body for last rites.

Police had to step in to pacify Nishaâ€™s sister, father and mother. Sisters Rosy and Monica alleged that their sister had been killed by her husband and in-laws. Nishaâ€™s mother said, â€˜â€˜We did not see her hanging from the hook. How can we believe this? All of them have killed my daughter. Now when everything is over why have they come to take her.â€�

Prakash Kaur and Harish Chawla, Nishaâ€™s parents-inlaw, said that they had been in General Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, for the past week due to Harishâ€™s illness. Refuting all the allegations, they said that they had always treated Nisha like their own daughter. Police faced a tough time when the girlâ€™s father Bishan tried to stop the in-laws demanding another postmortem examination at PGI.

Nisha who was working as a teacher was found hanging from a hook on the ceiling. Her in-laws had detached the body from the ceiling without informing the police.

Her body was first spotted by her mother-in-lawâ€™s sister Santosh who claimed to have entered the room through the window. Nishaâ€™s mother kept repeating that her inlaws used to harass her for not bearing a child and also prevented her from meeting her parents. The body was handed over to her family for cremation after the postmortem examination.

DSP Harpreet Singh said, â€˜â€˜We are looking into the matter. The viscera has been sent to Patiala for more details.â€�

Neighbours of Nisha said nothing about the Nisha and Manojâ€™s marital life. Sources say that both Manoj and Nisha were on good terms with each other. Manoj had lost his job with Punwire four years ago. Their relationship is said to have deteriorated back then.

3,Killed for protesting against eve-teasers,"ASANSOL: Thirty-two-yearold Sheikh Jakir paid a high price for protesting against a group of eve-teasers.

Five people simple killed him when he tried to stop them from molesting a woman at Sujapur village under Ketugram Police Station area on Wednesday night.

Police arrested five persons, including one woman, in this connection.

On March 24, Jakir has foiled an attempt by the same gang to molest a woman in Sujapur village. The gangsters then swore revenge.

On Wednesday night, Sheikh Hillal, along with five of his associates, gheraoed him in a lonely spot and hit him repeatedly with sharp weapons. He died soon after.

The attackers then tried to hide his body, but policemen from nearby camp turned up in time and arrested the gangsters.

SDPO of Katwa rushed to the village with a huge force and began combing operations.

The situation continues to be tense. A police picket has been posted in the area. Villagers appealed to the authorities to ensure that the killers are punished. They even wanted to give a posthumous bravery award to Sheikh Jakir.

4,Battle of one-upmanship over development,"AKBARPUR: When Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati held the reins of power in Uttar Pradesh, Akbarpur parliamentary constituencyâ€”where BJP has yet to register a winâ€”saw one scheme after another coming up. But with Mayawati making way for Mulayam, most of the schemes were abandoned, some even midway.

This virtually divided the Akbarpur electorate broadly into two camps; one clamouring for swift development and the other keen to maintain status quo. Another wedge was driven into the divide when chief minister Mulayam Singh disbanded the districts in the name of streamlining economy.

On April 26, people would cast their votes, with the two camps making an all-out bid to defeat each other. Among the projects presented to the people by the BSP president were government polytechnic, Vikas Bhawan, DM office, district judiciary complex, Rama Bai Degree College, district hospital and engineering college. Some of these projects may well have been conceptualised by Mayawatiâ€™s predecessors, but the credit went to her because of her aggressive brand of politics.

Of these, the DM office, district judiciary complex and Rama Bai Degree College are complete. Only 10 per cent of the work remains in the Vikash Bhawan project. According to official sources, together, these projects required an investment not less than Rs 300 crore, an enormous sum for the small town. A huge building came up with the promise of a 300-bed hospital in the heart of the city. The successor regime reduced the capacity to 100 beds. Work on a Rs 20-crore flyover railway crossing could not begin as the state government displayed indifference in bearing its cost burden, RB Pal of Akbarpur said, adding all this had enraged the people.

Now it suits Mayawati and her supporters to whip up peopleâ€™s support over these projects. And this was why Mayawati, after filing her papers, said that if she assumed the post of chief minister, her first act would be to restore the status of Akbarpur.

But chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is no novice. He has laid out plans to trap Mayawati in her own game. In the constituency, which has 28 per cent Dalit electorate, the Dalit-Muslim combination could be formidable. On her part, Mayawati has always preferred Nishands, Rajbhar and Dalits other than her own caste. This has caused resentment in this community. Mulayam is trying to add fuel to their ire against Mayawati.

Shank Lal Manjhi of Samajwadi Party is tipped to take on Mayawati. Although the Samajwadi Party could win only Jalalapur Assembly seat in this parliamentary constituency, Pawan Pandey of Lok Janshakti Party had lost Akbarpur assembly seat by a narrow margin of 4,000 votes. In Katihari assembly segment, Jai Shankar Pandey too lost by a small margin. If these disgruntled forces join hands, the fight against Mayawati could take an interesting turn, said Arun Mishra of Kaleour.

The people of Akbarpur, as it happens to be the birthplace of great socialist thinker Ram Manohar Lohia, are steeped in anti-Congress feelings. The opposition to Congress culture now extends to BJP as the saffron party is being patronised by many former Congressmen. All this makes it an ideal constituency for raising its head against the established norms. Since the time Ramjilal Suman of Congress lost the seat in 1989, the party lost whatever support it had enjoyed.

6,"Naxal violence toll 27, injured SP surfaces","RANCHI/PATNA: At least 27 policemen and a Naxalite were killed in a landmine blast triggered by ultra-left extremists at Baliwa village under Gua police station in West Singhbhum district, about 150 km from Ranchi, late on Wednesday night.

Earlier reports had said only 10 policemen were killed. However, official sources confirmed death of 27 policemen, including eight CRPF jawans, on Thursday. At least six other policemen were injured in the blast. The police also fear that the extremists took away the arms of the dead and injured police personnel.

District SP Praveen Kumar, who was reported missing since the incident, surfaced early on Thursday morning at the Kiriburu railway station with his driver and bodyguard. The 1997 batch IPS officer was later airlifted to Kolkata for medical treatment. He has received bullet injuries on his right arm and finger.

The incident occurred on the eve of deputy PM L K Advani''s entry into Jharkhand on Thursday. The police convoy, comprising district armed police and CRPF jawans and led by Kumar, was on patrolling ahead of Lok Sabha polls. Two extremist organisations, MCCI and People''s War, have given a call for boycotting elections in the state.

While the SP''s Gypsy passed over the landmine safely, the other five vehicles following him were blown up in the blast. However, in the firing that ensued between the police and Naxalites, the patrol tank of the Gypsy caught fire. After the encounter, police sources said, the SP entered into nearby forests along with his driver and bodyguard and walked throughout the night to reach the Kiriburu railway station at 4.30 am, the sources said.

Meanwhile, SP Kumar told TNN over phone from a Kolkata hospital that he was fine. ""It was around 4.30 pm when suddenly one of the escort vehicles just behind my Gypsy blew up in the blast. It was a matter of only seconds... It could have been my vehicle,"" he said, adding the forces engaged the Naxalites, who had ambushed the convoy, in an encounter which continued till midnight.

Speaking from Jamshedpur airport, the SP''s wife said: ""It was the most dreadful night that I ever had. I had the worst possible imaginations. All the family members joined me from Patna as soon as they heard the news. I was stupefied as I could not understand what to do. For all of us it was an ordeal that we would remember all our lives. I got the news that he was safe at 5.30 am in the morning.

7,Police arrest four hardcore criminals,"DANAPUR: Four hardcore criminals belonging to an inter-state gang were nabbed by the Danapur GRP from Mahananda Express (4044 Down) in the wee hours of Thursday at Danapur station. They were identified as Mohd. Rafi of village karaunia in Uttar Pradesh, Prem Narain of Sebaria in Uttar Pradesh, Lallan Prasad and Rakesh Singh, both of Bhojpur in Bihar. However, two others, identified as Bharat Gupta and Anant Teli, both from Uttar Pradesh, managed to escape.

According to Danapur GRP, acting on a tip-off the GRP sought special permission from the railways to detain Mahananda Express at Danapur in the wee hours of Thursday night to conduct an intensive search in each bogie of the train.

These criminals who had boarded the train at Buxar, were hiding in a sleeper coach and had planned to commit dacoity in the train, the GRP official said, adding that daggers, knives, cutters and other weapons were recovered from their possession.

In course of interrogation, they revealed that they had easy access to several political bigwigs of Uttar Pradesh. Their main areas of operation used to be the Allahabad-Varanasi, Allahabad-Mughalsarai and Mughalsarai-Jhajha sections of the Northern and East Central Railways. These criminals confessed that they had recently looted the passengers of Kurla- Patna Express and Archana Express on the Bihar-UP border, sources said.

Duwedi Phani Bhushan, SI, Danapur GRP, who led the operation, said that these criminals are prize catch for the railways before the Lok Sabha polls. In fact, they were wanted in several other cases related to loot, dacoity, robbery and snatching in the running trains. Police will now bring to book the two other absconding criminals, he said.

8,UN concerned with developments in Iraq,"UNITED NATIONS: Diplomats and officials at United Nations are watching with concern the rising violence and casualties in Iraq which could hurt the world body''s efforts to help organize elections early next year.

Though Secretary-General''s special adviser Lakhdar Brahimi continued discussions with various groups in Baghdad, diplomats say that organizing election is a complex task which would require a period of peace for massive preparation, including drawing up of electoral rolls, leading up to polls.

There could not be credible elections without peace in at least a major part of the country, they say.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a cautious statement on kidnapping of three Japanese, with militants of little known group Mujahedeen Squadrons threatening their lives.

Expressing concern over the deterioration of situation and loss of life in the last few days, Annan said he strongly believes that an ""inclusive dialogue"" and ""patiently pursued"" political process involving all Iraqis are essential ""at this particularly sensitive"" phase on the road to the restoration of sovereignty, stability and rule of law.

He called on all concerned to respect international law, particularly in regard to the protection of civilians and to intensify their efforts to end the current crisis.

Expressing concern over the threat to the Japanese, Annan called for their release as also of other innocent civilians who may have been abducted for political ends in the conflict.

9,No Ordinance to ban exit polls: Sorabjee,"NEW DELHI: Attorney General Soli J Sorabjee has shot down the Election Commission''s proposal for an Ordinance to ban publication of opinion and exit polls during the period of election, saying it would be violative of the fundamental right to free speech.

In his four-page opinion on the query referred to him, Sorabjee strongly came in favour of upholding the fundamental right to free speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and said the proposed Ordinance would hit at the root of the fundamental right.

Taking note of the unanimous opinion of the political parties in favour of such a ban on opinion and exit polls, the Attorney General said, ""regard must be paid to the unanimous view of political parties but their view is not decisive on the question of constitutionality of a statute.""

While opposing a complete ban, Sorabjee suggested that certain restrictions could be imposed on the publication of these opinion or exit polls.

He said the Council of Europe''s recommendation could serve as a model law by which all those who publish such kind of polls would be asked to name the political party or the other organisations or persons which commissioned the poll and paid for it.

He said the opinion poll or the exit poll should reveal the identity of the organisation conducting the poll, the methodology employed therein, the size of the sample, the margin of error and the date and period in which the poll was conducted.

The commission, after holding an all party meeting, had recommended to the government on April 6 for promulagation of an Ordinance to ban opinion and exit polls as ""publishing of the results of such polls during the period of election has the effect of influencing the minds of electors.""

Rejecting the idea, Sorabjee in his opinion said that whatever could be the basis of the idea for the proposed ban, the government could not resort to an Ordinance as such poll surveys were being conducted for last many years.

Therefore, it was difficult to conclude that circumstances impel the necessity for urgent and immediate action for the issuance of an Ordinance, he said.

Terming as ""highly debatable"" the constitutionality of such an Ordinance, the Attorney General said, ""a serious and formidable objection to the proposed ordinance is that it would be violative of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.""

He said it was a well settled principle that right to free speech guaranteed under the Constitution included the right of the people to know, the right to receive information and the right of the citizen to disseminate information.

He said information from divergent and antagonistic sources would help voters to make an informed choice which was similar to the choice made by the people after reading various articles and editorials in different newspapers.

""Consequently, the restriction on freedom of speech and expression as contemplated by the proposed ordinance do not satisfy and are not covered by any one or more of the permissible heads of restrictions set out under Article 19(2),"" he concluded.

10,Family's party choices weighs down rural women,"VIRAMGAM: Vasundhara Raje, Uma Bharti and Sheila Dixit may have swept the polls in the recent assembly elections of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. But illiteracy, financial dependence and age-old traditions still prevent the rural women from exercising their franchise independently. Even if they do, few acknowledge it openly!

However, women leaders claim that things have changed considerably in Gujarat since the Lok Sabha elections of 1999. Says education minister Anandiben Patel: â€œNow more women come out during campaigning than men.Even at my â€˜sabhaâ€™, there were 25 women and eight men.â€� Mayor Aneesa Mirza adds, â€œIn the last two or three years, we have had more women â€˜sarpanchâ€™ coming in which has helped in changing perceptions.â€� However, a visit to some villages of Dhandhuka Lok Sabha constituency tells a different story.

Says Leelaben Vaghela of Khoda village, â€œI do not know whom to vote for as I hardly ever go out of the house and am not allowed to attend the campaign speeches. But I will vote as per my husbandâ€™s choice as I donâ€™t want it to go waste.â€�

Many women of this village shy away from saying anything. And men echo with pride, â€œGharwala nu vaat to sambharvuj padse!â€� â€œOf course,â€� says Mirza, â€œYou canâ€™t rule out the concept of â€˜pati parmeshwarâ€™ totally. However, this is more caste specific.

The â€˜darbarâ€™ women still live in â€˜parda.â€™ So, they will not be allowed to vote out of their own choice.â€� But the trend seems to cut across castes. Sajanben Koripatel of Madhavpur says, â€œHow can I vote out of my choice when I am not allowed to go out of the house.â€� Geetaben Patel of the same village adds, â€œNo wife votes against her husbandâ€™s choice.â€�

In Mandalnagar, a woman standing near a shop shakes her head vaguely, saying, â€œI will vote for whoever I am asked to vote for.â€� Shopkeeper Ashok Kansara says, â€œHamare yahan to pativrata chalta hai, ye sab apne gharwale ki marzi se hi vote dengi.â€™â€™ In Kalana, a Pathan-dominated village, women watch from fringes as men talk. Voting out of their choice is clearly out of question here.

Says Ilaben Pathak of the Ahmedabad Womenâ€™s Action Group (AWAG): â€œRural women are bound by too many social and cultural constraints. They are hardly literate. Some of them are not even aware of their right to vote and most are not allowed to vote.â€�

In Dhandhuka, in comparison to 52 per cent men who voted, only 38 per cent women cast their votes in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections. Nobody can predict a tentative figure this time.

Yet, even as the patriarchal system holds strong, where women hesitate to talk, Daksha Shah, a teacher in a â€˜panchayat balmandirâ€™ at Mandalnagar says, â€œThey will not tell the truth as they are scared of their husbands. When the time comes, theyâ€™ll vote for the party they want to vote for.â€� An option not ruled out by Patel or Mirza either.

A number of thefts had recently been reported from sectors 30, 39 and 41. At night, therefore, the police took to extensive patrolling in these areas.

On Friday night, a policeman spotted a boy sitting in a parked car in sector 39. When the policeman went up to the car, he found that the boy was trying to steal the car stereo.
