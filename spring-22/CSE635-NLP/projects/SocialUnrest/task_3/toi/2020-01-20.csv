0,Council polls — whither women!,"LUCKNOW: The biennial elections to the 12 seats of the Vidhan Parishad has once again exposed the hollowness of the demand of political parties to provide 33 per cent reservation to women in Parliament and the state legislatures.

While the Parishad elections in all likelihood will be unopposed, only one woman candidate, Kusum Rai of the Rashtriya Kranti Party, whose name figures among the 13 who had filed their nominations. Going by the demand of 33 per cent, at least 3, if not 4, women candidates should have been in the fray.

The ''deliberate oversight'' or empty talk of ''women''s uplift'' has predictably left the fairer sex of all political parties seething in disgust.

Topping the list is the Samajwadi Party which has put up four candidates and had announced its intent to extend support to Kusum Rai in case of an election. The task of deciding the names of candidates had been left to party president Mulayam Singh Yadav. When the names were finally announced no woman candidate figured in the list. Sources reveal that many in the mahila wing of the party are not to happy with the decision as they desired an adequate representation.

Their anger does not end here. It extends to the fact that support has been given to Kusum Rai, though a woman candidate but not of the SP. A party worker stated: ""When it comes to dharnas and demonstrations, women are expected to participate in the same. But when it comes to naming a candidate, the fairer sex is ignored."" Regarding the RKP, the argument was ""What justification could there be in supporting a candidate of a party with four MLAs, when there was no dearth of women candidates in the party itself"".

The SP is not alone on this front. The BJP, which waxes eloquent on the theme of women''s empowerment, also did not find any woman suitable in its rank and file to name as its candidate. The three named by it, namely Ramji Singh, Raj Kumar Tyagi and Surendra Nath alias Puttu Awasthi are all men.

Chief minister Mayawati, though a woman herself, decided on the names of Naseemuddin Siddiqui, Dharam Prakash and Srinath to represent the party in the Upper House.

The Congress, likewise, followed suit. With Sonia Gandhi as its national president, it chose Ranjit Singh Judeo as the party''s candidate.

Amongst all these it was only the RKP which chose to nominate a woman candidate. By fielding Kusum Rai there is at least one member of the fairer sex in the biennial polls.

1,Political stalwarts ignore development issue,"KISHANGANJ: Thirteen years on, Kishanganj which was upgraded to a district on January 14, 1990, is no better than window dressing; the basic and necessary infra-structure which should go with district-hood are just illusory.

Not very unsurprisingly, there is hardly any hullaballoo. Even customary establishment day celebrations have been given a go-by.Though Kishanganj was accorded the status of a district after a prolonged and sustained campaign, thanks to the timely political chemistry between the then Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra and newly-elected Congress MP journalist - turned - politician M J Akbar, several district-level key departments like agriculture, civil supplies, education (DEO) forest, labour PRD are yet to open here.

Add to then, there has always been an acute dearth of magistrates and officers to man labyrinthine departments like transport, panchayats supplies, to name a few. For want of adequate man-power, most of the deputy collectors are saddled with charges of two, three or even more department. Over burdened and surcharged, they can scarcely be expected to do justice to their assigned obligations. Adhocism is rather the rule.

Nirmal Lal Prasad, president, Bar Assocation, regrets that though the conveted status of a district was accorded long ago, the district judge (DJ) court has not as yet been set-up. The judiciary is very much inclined to do, but due to lack of adequate court rooms and residential quarters the decision has virtually been kept in abeyance, he informs.

""More than a decade after its elevation, record of rights and land documents are yet to be transferred here by parent Purnia district"", bemoans Abdul Haque, senior advocate ""people in need of them have to travel to Purnia incur heavy expenditure and waste couple of days"", he grunted.

Kishanganj district utterly lacks infrastructure. So much so that collectorate and police district headquarters are yet to come up. These offices operate in the building of silk department which have literally been usurped. DM''s residential quarters have been constructed. But the SP lives on the mercy of market yard and owes more than Rs 40 lakh as vent, according to a report.

Though Kishanganj always have had larger than life political stalwarts like Shahnawaz Hussain, civil aviation minister, Taslimuddin, Bihar building construction minister at the moment and Rafiq Alam, Syed Shahabudin, Munna Mushtaq and M J Akbar from wide political spectrum, they seem to have scant concern for its all-round development and have had their own axe to grind.

At every stage Kishanganj could boast of more than adequate representation in Bihar and central ministry. But they hardly ever struggled to live upto people''s hopes and aspirations, rues Prabhu Prasad.

2,Want an election I-card? Think over!,"NEW DELHI: Talk about an identity crisis. That ticket to limitless access, the voter I-card, does not come easy, even for the bonafide resident Indian.

The journey begins virtually, at a website that promises all but free home delivery. A voter I-card shall be handed to you within half-an-hour. The venue is listed alongside, open all weekdays. Please note you will not be able to vote hereafter without furnishing a voter I-card.

An old victim of government functioning, you play safe and take a day off to complete the important task of identity seeking. For Kasturba Nagar constituency, the centre is a short drive to bustling Lajpat Nagar. At Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodya Bal Vidyalaya.

The impressive name does not lend itself to the surroundings. Beyond the school gates the decrepit building inspires little confidence. The children have just vacated the classrooms for the day, but you wouldn''t know it, had you not seen them leave.

The dusty floor is littered with bird droppings, paper and plastic. The rickety wooden benches have given way in parts, replaced by large moulded plastic chairs in an incongruous fading green. A cold draught sweeps in through the broken windowpanes.

""In the hall"", a helpful soul eggs you on, pointing across a large courtyard, where more plastic chairs await their turn to be recycled as benches. For now they have been dumped in an unsightly pile. The walk across to the ""hall"" is over more dust and dirt. Pigeons live where the roof has ceased to exist.

The hall is a place that has clearly been given up for dead by even this school. In the huge, dank emptiness it is difficult to tell who or what constitutes the I-card dispensing mechanism. As the eye adjusts to the darkness, you spot two dismal figures behind tiny wooden tables.

""A little primitive"" intones a phlegmatic gentleman, resolutely resisting the urge to follow his wife who has retired in a paroxysm of coughing behind a silk handkerchief. He is understating. The hi-tech world of computers that urged you to get your I-card without a hitch has passed this place by. In fact, even electricity is at a premium, explains the apologetic, young woman who wearily hands out a form.

""Are you on the electoral rolls?"" she asks. ""Well I have been voting for 14 years"", you say cheerily. The effort is wasted. She looks at you suspiciously and thumbs her way through several worn-out lists before taking back her form and informing that you shall be served at the other table.

This entails a walk through the hall. Countless steel almirahs of indeterminate vintage have been condemned here, used ingeniously by the new occupants to mark out an area for the photographs to be taken. The photographer sits wanly in his designated space waiting for electricity. More plastic chairs connive with bits of wood to trip you.

At the other table, a middle-aged man furnishes the same form. And carefully turns the pages of another moth-eaten list of voters. Are you that old, you wonder.

The right address found there is another predicament. You are listed as your father''s wife. Curious. Your mother is also listed as your father''s wife, so is his mother, your grandmother.

""I would like to change that detail,"" you suggest. ""Your husband''s name?"" he asks. ""Well, yes, my husband''s name...that is my father."" Not a flicker on his face. This man has seen stranger things than three generations wedded to the same man. Calmly, he gives you another form: ""You have to apply for a change in husband."" You let that pass.

Now only the simple task of filling out two forms. ""Do you have proof of residence"", the man inquires. ""This shall be my proof of residence"", you submit. ""Driver''s licence, passport, telephone bill?"" he insists.

No. It is to be able to acquire those that you need the voter I-card. They won''t give you a passport or driverâ€™s licence without proof of residence. He shrugs and loses interest. ""Come back with some documents."" In an hour? ""You can try but it is no use if there is no electricity,"" he informs you.

""Don''t make it beyond four."" Advice from the woman standing in queue behind you. I came to collect my card before 4 p.m. yesterday. They had closed for the day. The door behind her helpfully bears the legend: From 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.

3,India protests Pak harassment of senior diplomat,"NEW DELHI: India has lodged a strong protest with Pakistan over the ""unprecedented harassment"" of its charge d''affaires (CDA) in Islamabad, Sudhir Vyas, whose official vehicle flying the Indian flag was repeatedly blocked on Saturday and again on Monday, and demanded that the neighbour follow diplomatic norms and not vitiate bilateral ties further.

Vyas is known for his polite behaviour and patient handling of situations under severe provocation. His continued harassment, even as India was lodging its protest, indicated heightened tension.

But external affairs ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna ruled out any move to recall Vyas, who has been holding charge after high commissioner Vijay Nambiar was recalled to highlight the involvement of Pak-trained terrorists in the attack on the Indian Parliament on December 13, 2001.

Frustration at the US''s indifference to its demand that India be pressured to come to the negotiation table, and alarm at the clamour at home for improving economic ties with India pending solution of other issues are the reasons being cited in diplomatic circles for the spurt in violent Pak behaviour.

The incidents are not rare in that a number of Indian military attaches and counsellors posted in Pakistan have been harassed, humiliated and even beaten up.

New Delhi on Monday handed over a representative list of such recent incidents, seven of them against one diplomat, Vipin Handa, alone, to Pakistan''s acting high commissioner here, Jalil Abbas Jilani.

Yet, two days after the first incident against Vyas, Islamabad professed innocence and instead came up with a ''disclosure'' that it was Jilani, who was being ""aggressively chased and harassed by Indian intelligence agencies for almost two weeks"".

A press release by the Pakistan High Commission here did not explain why Islamabad took so long, and waited for Saturday''s incident in Islamabad, to make a revelation that it had actually lodged a formal protest with the Indian foreign office regarding Jilani on January 7.

The press release also claimed that the Islamabad incidents were ""non-existent"". But Sarna called the Pakistani counter-charge ""motivated and baseless"", adding: ""We have it from our CDA that these incidents happened."" He was unaware of any Pakistani protest lodged here. Jilani was summoned to South Block on Monday afternoon and in a note verbale given to him, Arun Kumar Singh, MEA''s joint secretary in charge of the Pakistan desk, said: ""Such harassment is unprecedented and amounts to a clear attempt by Pakistan''s intelligence services to thwart the CDA in the performance of his diplomatic duties.""

Besides displaying a lack of normal courtesy to the national flag of the accredited country, in this case the Indian flag flying on the CDA''s car, ""the harassment represents gross violation of the bilateral code of conduct for treatment of diplomatic personnel in India and Pakistan signed by the two countries in 1992 as well as international norms, including the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations of 1961"".

Asked about the timing of the incident, he said: ""Any timing of such incidents is unfortunate.""

Vyas and his wife were travelling in his official vehicle when the Pakistani sleuths forcibly prevented them from proceeding for their official engagements on Saturday.

The CDA''s car was blocked before his residence and forcibly prevented from leaving on two occasions when he and his wife were proceeding to attend official diplomatic engagements at the Malaysian and Nepalese missions, the spokesman said.

He said when the flag car was finally able to leave the residence, it was forcibly stopped and boxed in by four vehicles and two motorcycles repeatedly on the main roads while he was proceeding to the functions and returning from there.

""At one point even after 11 p.m., the car was boxed in for about 45 minutes and when they returned, the intelligence personnel attempted to block the entrance gate to his residence by parking a vehicle in front of the gate,"" Sarna said.

4,Development plan for island groups to be chalked out,"NEW DELHI: The Standing Committee of Secretaries will recommend to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) a set of development strategies and operational rules for various sectors in the Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar Islands within three months.

The areas include harnessing hydrocarbon resources and developing high-value agriculture, fisheries and tourism, and to strengthen ""critical infrastructure"" such as ports and shipping, electricity and communications.

The Union environment ministry has also been told not to delay the ecology-linked clearance of a project to establish harbour facilities on the eastern side of Lakshadweep.

These are among the decisions taken at last week''s meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Vajpayee, at Port Blair in the Andamans. The PM heads the Island Development Authority (IDA), established in 1986 to ensure the ecologically sound development of the country''s two major island chains.

The IDA had not met for nearly a decade. But it was decided that it would meet ""more regularly"". K C Pant, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, was among those who attended the meet.

The Andamans are to get a government helicopter service between its islands. The meeting promised this and also almost full coverage by All India Radio and Doordarshan over the next four years, besides more telecom facilities.

Basic facilities are lacking: Port Blair, the Andaman capital, lacks adequate drinking water despite its huge rainfall. The IDA said it would have consultants appointed to devise a ""cost-effective"" solution. Jobs are also lacking but there are no quick solutions. A project report is to be readied for processing of fish and coconut in the Andamans.

The Union health ministry will depute specialists to Lakshadweep for periods upto three months at a time since it lacks such doctors.

5,LDA to maintain rally ground,"LUCKNOW: The state government has made it clear that the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) would look after the maintenance of the 50-acre Ambedkar rally ground near the Jail Road.

According to a GO, funds generated from sponsors and organisers of rallies would go to the LDA which after meeting the maintenance expenses would forward the remaining amount to the awasthapna kosh. The transfer of the land was surrounded by controversies right from the word go as the Lucknow Nagar Nigam (LNN) had alleged that the land belonged to it. Several LNN corporators, who had raised voice against the move to transfer it to the Awas Vikas, were snubbed by the state government as chief minister Mayawati was interested in developing it as a rally ground.

Besides, the LDA has also decided to open a separate bank account for depositing the money collected as gate fees at the Ambedkar memorial in Gomti Nagar.

Giving this information to reporters, LDA vice-chairman Diwakar Tripathi said that they had also finalised ways to meet the expenditure at the memorial.

These suggestions would be forwarded to the state government soon, the V-C added.
