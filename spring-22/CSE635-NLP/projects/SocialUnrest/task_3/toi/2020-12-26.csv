1,Rebels protest bid to nail Tej,"CHANDIGARH: The strife in the Punjab Congress took a new turn, on Friday, when a group of dissidents, led by Transport minister Tej Prakash Singh, protested to the state governor against the Vigilance Bureauâ€™s move to refer a corruption complaint against him to the Chandigarh police for ""appropriate action"".

Nine dissidents, led by Tej Parkash, called on Governor OP Verma,who is also the UT Administrator, and urged him that he should not take cognizance of the matter as the the complaint was ""politically-motivated"".

The dissidents described it as ""another below-the-belt attack"" on them which was aimed at intimidating them into stopping their campaign against the CM. Such action, they said, was akin to the ""raids"" carried out in the recent past on the business premises of other dissident leaders including Tripat Bajwa and Raj Kumar Verka.

The Vigilance Bureau had received a complaint from an Amritsar resident Vinod Kumar alleging that Hari Kumar Mehra and his son, Ashwani Kumar, had taken Rs 5 lakh, as a part of a Rs 12-lakh deal, from him which was to be paid to the minister to secure bus route permits. Ashwani Kumar is an assistant to the minister.

The complaint was filed on on November 3 this year. The bureau sat on it for about one and a half months before referring it to the I-G of the UT police on December 16 .

2,Hospitals fail to repair equipment,"KOLKATA: It''s a bad time to have a heart disease in Kolkata. The angioplasty equipment at SSKM Hospital â€” the lone such set-up in any government facility in the city â€” is out of order. So are the colonoscopy and endoscopy equipment at RG Kar Hospital.

It will be at least two weeks before the SSKM angioplasty and liver function testing equipment are repaired. The SSKM authorities have been referring patients needing immediate angioplasty to private hospitals â€” where the charge is twice that of government hospitals. There is no point going to SSKM for a pathology test, either. The lab has run out of reagents. There''s some good news, though, for those who have been waiting for an angiography at SSKM Hospital. The equipment has been repaired and is expected to start functioning on Monday.

Can it get any worse? Apparently, yes. ""The orthoscope machine also needs immediate repair. The health department had paid huge sums for procuring these machines but how can they be of any use if they are lying without repair,"" said a senior official.

""Costly machines were imported to provide better healthcare but many of them are defunct because of lack of maintenance. Hospitals do not have the expertise to either check their quality or repair them,"" said another official.

The health department has sanctioned about Rs 14 lakh for repairing the angioplasty machine, which was bought from a Holland-based company.

The state has run into problems with the company. The government does not have any annual maintenance contract with any of the companies. Health department officials are now trying to get the clause introduced in all fresh contracts.

Director of medical education C.R. Maity went to SSKM on Friday to inquire into the matter. Later, health secretary Asim Barman promised that the repairs would be completed soon.

3,"Maid, sister arrested for elderly woman's murder","KOLKATA: A day after 52-yearold Gayatri Devi Singhal was killed in her New Alipore apartment, the police on Friday arrested her maid Rina Bar from the Sagar Islands. Though some cash and jewellery were seized from her, the police are baffled over the gruesome nature of the murder.

On Thursday, the elderly lady was killed while she was asleep alone in her flat. Rina and her sister Tina were detained immediately after they stepped into their home at Harinbari village in the morning. The police had been camping in the village since Thursday night. They were initially misled by an old person staying there. He later turned out to be the duo''s father. Rina''s statements led to the recovery of Rs 57,000 in cash and 500 grams of jewellery. The police hope to recover more.

Sleuths still cannot fathom why a cold-blooded murderer would choose to return to the most obvious place â€” her home.

She had not only slashed the victim''s throat with a knife, but also hit her with a bonti and strangulated her. However, there were hardly any blood stains anywhere other than the two weapons. Sleuths claimed the scheming Rina did not stop at that. She removed from the scene of crime the only person who could have caught her red-handed â€” driver Mahdav Ram.

At 5 am, she asked Ram to drop her at Sahapur where Tina worked. Madhav did that and noticed the murder only after he came back. DC (south) Anuj Sharma said, ""The murder was timed perfectly. Rina knew where the valuables were kept.""

Police have learnt that Rina is married and her husband works in Andhra Pradesh. She could have fled there, too. The officer did not rule out others conspiring with her.

5,Virbhadra alleges graft in govt appointments,"NEW DELHI: Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh on Friday alleged there was rampant corruption in the appointments made during the previous state BJP government led by P K Dhumal.

7,Works of MP Cong govt to be reviewed,"BHOPAL: Barely three weeks after taking over, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday decided to review major decisions taken by the previous Congress regime in the last six months including imposition of community fines and raising job quota for backward classes from 14 per cent to 27 per cent.

""Since some decisions of the previous government in its last six months are suspected to be of political nature, department will review matters relating to their respective fields"", PWD Minister Kailash Vijayavargiya told reporters after a meeting of the state Cabinet.

He said the community fines imposed in Rajgarh for attacks on Dalits, Ganj Basoda in connection with cow slaughter and in Dhar over violence over the controversial Bhojshala issue was among the decisions to be reviewed.

The decision to raise job reservation for OBCs from 14 to 27 per cent would also be reviewed, he said adding, that a three member committee of ministers would look into the reports from all departments after their review for a final stand and the whole process is likely to be completed in 15 days.

On power crisis, he said Chief Minister Uma Bharti has directed replacement of all faulty and defunct transformers in the state, numbering about 3,000, with new ones by January 15 and ensure six hour uninterrupted electricity for farmers to irrigate their Rabi crops.

Regarding Simhastha to be held in Ujjain next year, he accused previous Congress government of having given a political colour to the land held by RSS in the pilgrim town in a bid to defame the Sangh.

Vijayavargiya said the Digvijay Singh government had adopted a faulty approach towards Simhastha as it isolated Ujjain city while planning for the mega event.

He said work is progressing on a war-footing to make Simhastha a success.

Necessary steps were being taken to prevent break out of diseases during the mela, Vijayavargiya said and added the sub-committee set up to go into reinstatement of some 20,000 daily wage employees gave its first report on Saturday.
