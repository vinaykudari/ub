1,Naraina Vihar residents protest construction of shopping mall,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has decided to convert 6,000 square feet of residential area in Naraina Vihar into a commercial complex.

The complex will comprise 300 shops which are at present located on Ring Road. The relocation has been necessitated by the widening of Ring Road to facilitate the construction of a flyover at the Naraina crossing.

Residents of Naraina Vihar who are against the DDAâ€™s decision to change land use claim the commercial complex is against the zonal developmental plan of the area. They said the DDA will felling trees and razing a green patch to construct the complex. They claimed these shops are unauthorised.

DDAâ€™s commissioner for planning Vijay Risbund justified the change. â€˜â€˜This project is also for the development of the area,â€™â€™ he said. The residents, however, said their protest was valid for another reason. Naraina Vihar has a commercial complex in its vicinity. But half of it is lying vacant. â€˜â€˜What stops the colony from having two commercial complexes. Moreover, the complex will have small shops and will not be a multi-storey,â€™â€™ said Risbund.

Wing Commander S Prakash (Retd), a resident of the area, said the complex was unplanned. The ongoing work supports Prakashâ€™s claim. The DDA will allot 100 square feet to each shopkeeper. But the road between the two rows of shops will be only 10 feet wide. â€˜â€˜The gap is too narrow and may prove to be disastrous in case of fire. The power transformer is also close to this new complex,â€™â€™ said Prakash.

Inder Rajput, another resident, questioned the purpose of the complex.

â€˜â€˜We do not need it,â€™â€™ he said. Apart from increasing burden on civic amenities in the area, the residents fear, the complex will also infringe upon their privacy. â€˜â€˜It will increase noise pollution, cause littering and traffic congestion in the colony,â€™â€™ said Rajput.

Prakash seconded his claim. â€˜â€˜The road outside the complex is not wide enough to accommodate traffic. It will get extended into our colony which will be a security hazard,â€™â€™ he said.

Another resident, S L Saighal, claimed the issue of widening the Ring Road had been on for nearly 20 years. â€˜â€˜The DDA was allocated a separate plot near the colony where there is space for car parking. There are no trees there and it is not a green patch,â€™â€™ said Saighal.

Risbund denied the DDA ever had another plot. â€˜â€˜There was no proposal as such,â€™â€™ he said.

2,"Cong, Oppn protest govt reply on drinking water","PATNA: The Congress and the entire opposition members in the legislative council on Thursday staged a walkout over the unsatisfactory reply of the government with regard to the supply of pure drinking water in the city.

When the minister for urban development minister Sri Narain Yadav started giving his reply on the drinking water supply in the city during an half-an-hour special debate, the entire opposition and the Congress members staged a walkout.

Sheo Nandan Prasad Singh of the Congress while criticising the government said that this debate will not yield anything.

Ram Kripal Yadav of the RJD said all the water pipelines laid down in the city have rusted which needs to be repaired. The existing water supply system has not been able to cope with the tremendous rise of population in the city, he added. At least 60 per cent of the population, residing in Kankerbagh Colony, are suffering from jaundice and other water-related diseases, Yadav said. He also drew the attention of the government towards the theft of water in different localities of Patna.

Tanvir Hasan of the JD(U) said rampant corruption in the water board is the major cause for this. Amidst noisy scenes, the urban development minister admitted that water pipelines in the city have become very old and obsolete.

3,City lawyer accused of using fake LLB degree,"NEW DELHI: An advocate has been accused of using a fake graduation and LL.B degrees to get himself registered with the Delhi Bar Council (DBC). The council, a body of lawyers, had enrolled Rajesh Sharma in 2000, allowing him to start practising.

The qualifications were found to be forgeries when a law firm in New Zealand, DJ Porteous Lawyers, sent an inquiry to Bundelkhand University from where the degrees were allegedly issued.

Sharma had applied for admission to the New Zealand Law Society to be registered as a barrister and solicitor and David Porteous of the law firm was checking up. Porteousâ€™ letter was dated May 24 and Sharmaâ€™s graduation and LLB degrees were enclosed.

In reply, registrar of Bundelkhand University V K Sinha said: â€˜â€˜I am directed to inform you that the graduation degree of 1996 submitted by Rajesh Sharma is fake.â€™â€™ The letter says the vice-chancellorâ€™s signature was also forged. The letter added that Sharma was not even eligible for admission to the law course. DBC chairman K C Mittal said he was yet to study the case. â€˜â€˜We shall refer it to the police,â€™â€™ he said.

Sharmaâ€™s case is just the tip of an iceberg. The DBC says several such cases might be buried in the files.

4,Lohegaon Residents protest against harassment by defence officials,"Pune: Residents in the vicinity of the Air Force station, Lohegaon, stridently protested against harassment caused by defence authorities blocking use of the Lohegaon road, on Thursday.

Irked by the alleged misbehaviour of Air Force security men, residents from Khese Park, Sanjay park, Kalwad vasti and Lohegaon held demonstrations in front of the divisional commissioner and municipal commissioners office.

While handing over a memorandum to divisional commissioner Umeshchandra Sarangi, former sarpanch of Lohegaon, Pandurang Khese, said that Air Force officials were obstructing them from using the Lohegaon village road in defiance of court orders. Khese said that both the sessions and district court had given the villagers a right of way to use the road.

The Air Force officials not only stop people but subject them to acute embarrassment by undertaking checks of even personal belongings, said a villager in an emotionally-charged atmo-sphere.

Another villager told Sarangi that driving licenses had been confiscated by security men of Lohegaon airbase on the basis of suspicion. The protestors also raked up the issue of ban on construction within a periphery of 900 metres from the air force station. Interestingly, the protestors included some retired defence officials who were critical of the Air Forceâ€™s stand to stop all constructions on the land within 900 metres from the boundary of the airbase.

Sarangi, while speaking to TNN, said he would call a meeting of Air Force officials to find some solution to the problem of villagers being allowed use of the Lohegaon road.

The residents of these areas also went to the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) on Thursday to protest absence of basic civic amenities in their areas. The residents complained that they did not have proper internal roads, water supply and drainage system despite being under the PMC for the past 40 years.

5,State govt survives no-trust vote,"KOLKATA: The Left Front government on Thursday comfortably survived an Opposition sponsored noconfidence motion in the state assembly by 167 votes to 60 after a five hour debate - but not before Opposition MLAs had built a case against what they termed as â€œan economically bankrupt and increasingly undemocratic and fascist governmentâ€� and the chief minister had made at least one controversial statement.

In his reply before the House after the marathon debate, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the Opposition leader had no right to meet anyone in police or judicial custody during interrogation. Earlier leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjee had accused the government of â€œtrampling on democracyâ€� for not allowing him to meet arrested lecturer of CU Kaushik Ganguly in custody. â€œThe law does not permit anyone but the manâ€™s lawyer to meet him inside lock-up. You cannot be allowed unless you have the courtâ€™s permission to meet him,â€� Bhattacharjee told Banerjee. However, Trinamul MLA and mayor Subrata Mukherjee pointed out that as leader of Opposition Banerjee enjoyed the rank of a cabinet minister and was therefore well within his rights to meet a undertrial in lockup.

Earlier Trinamul Congress leader Saugata Roy pointed to the governmentâ€™s failure to pay school teachersâ€™ salaries and retired teachersâ€™ pension on time to accuse it of being â€œa bankrupt government.â€� The issue of recent arrests of suspected Peopleâ€™s War activists expectedly dominated the debate with Opposition MLAâ€™s suggesting that the â€œterror of Peopleâ€™s Warâ€� was a â€œfigment of the Marxists imagination, which they were using to eliminate those who had left the CPM as well as Trinamul supporters.

6,Buddha criticises report on PW man's suicide,"KOLKATA: The suicide of customs inspector Abhjit Sinha rocked the West Bengal Assembly on Thursday, even as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee termed the incident as â€œunfortunateâ€� and said the police report was â€œunsatisfactoryâ€�.

Bhattacharjee refuted accusations that the recent arrests of PW activists were illegal and said none of them had been taken out of judicial custody by the police in violation of the law.

â€œWe are not fools. We took written permission from the court to take the suspects out of custody and to the â€˜spotâ€™. There is no question of disobeying the court order,â€� he said.

Bhattacharjee argued that according to Section 41A of the CrPC, police could arrest a person without warrant if the offence was cognisable. He said, â€œThe suicide was a regrettable incident. I am not satisfied with the police report, and that is why the special secretary of the home department has been ordered to conduct an inquiry.

â€œIf the police are found to have not acted in accordance with law, proper steps will be taken.â€�The chief minister indicated that Sinha might not have been innocent.

â€œHis telephone was used regularly by Kaushik Biswas, who is still absconding. The phone was used to call two noted militants in Andhra Pradesh. However, I do not wish to raise these issues now that Sinha is dead,â€� he remarked.

Bhattacharjee said that interrogation of recently arrested PW activists had shown that the groupâ€™s policies were being decided by its leaders in Kolkata. â€œIt has been established from the statements of two arrested CPI(ML) PW activists Sudip Chongdar and Partha Sarathy Banerjee that the murders of CPM leaders and activists were planned from Kolkata,â€� he said.

The telephone numbers of Kaushik Ganguly, a chemical engineering lecturer of Calcutta University, along with Tinku Ghosh and Parashar Bhattacharya, were found in the diaries of Chongdar and Banerjee.

The chief minister dismissed the Opposition demand for a judicial probe into Sinhaâ€™s suicide, stating that the department was competent to conduct it. He also dismissed allegations that the terror of the 1970s was returning.

Rather, he attacked back when Trinamul Congress member Sougata Roy raised the issue of moral obligations for respecting democratic rights.

â€œEven if I have to die, I will never act the way Siddhartha Shankar Roy did. â€œYou have no right to talk about morals as your hands are stained with blood,â€� he said. Irate Trinamul MLAs staged a walkout in protest.

7,MCC area commander arrested in Varanasi,"VARANASI: The district police arrested an area commander of the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) Mohd Hashim in Omkaleshwar area under the Adampur police station on Wednesday night. The police recovered a pistol and live cartridges in huge quantity from his possession.

After getting a tip-off that Hashim would visit a house in Omkaleshwar area, the police laid a trap and succeeded in nabbing the militant. During interrogation, he admitted that he was area commander of the MCC which had been banned by the government.

He said that he got training in carrying out subversive activities in the jungles of Bihar. Hashim, who was active at Bhabhua in Bihar, added that he was in the city to meet some local persons who were interested in joining the MCC. According to sources, the MCC has been active in the neighbouring districts of Chandauli, Mirzapur and Sonebhadra for the last six years.

The first FIR against MCC activists was lodged with the Naugarh police in October 2000 in connection with the abduction and killing of two persons.

Sources said that the MCC had constituted over 20 area and village committees in the eastern region. While area committees held monthly meetings to chalk out future plans, the ICO camp (main assembly) of MCC activists, held once in a year, was addressed by a top communist leader from a foreign country, the sources added.

8,Ex-Mahila Cong leader blasted over anti-party comments,"LUCKNOW: UPCC president Arun Kumar Singh Munna dismissed Ranjana Bajpai, former president of Mahila Congress as â€œa leader of no consequence and little statureâ€�. He claimed that her entry in the SP camp would not make the slightest of difference to the party.

â€œCongress does not require the support of spent forces and wallflowers like Bajpai, said Munna, who termed her going away as a good omen. â€œThis shows we are already on way to revival,â€� he quipped.

Bajpaiâ€™s betrayal said the UPCC chief, brings into focus the wrong judgement and misplaced faith of those who supported her candidature for Biswan seat in the last assembly election. â€œShe got the ticket, contested, lost and yet assuming a wronged air staged a walk-out, while the former MLA from the area whose claim to the ticket was turned down in her favour, still very much remains in the party, he remarked, while talking to mediapersons on Thursday. Hamein band kamre mein politics karne wale nahin chahiye, he declared, â€œwe want leaders who are willing to go out on the street fighting for the common manâ€�.

He also said that he wouldnâ€™t be surprised if a few more like Bajpai would also follow her footsteps in the coming days.

Reacting strongly to the statement made by Bajpai that by withholding support to the SP, Congress was responsible for the formation of a coalition government in the state, Munna said his party had supported Yadav whenever it was required to fight communal forces. â€œBut we will definitely not lend support to encourage horse-trading,â€� he said, adding further that Congress party in any case did not need a certificate of being secular from Bajpai. Ranjana Bajpai had become a centre of unsavoury controversy when her name was cleared for the Biswan assembly seat over the claims of Ram Kumar Bhargava.

10,Bihar govt should promote films: Smita Thackeray,"PATNA: Smita Thackeray, president of the Indian Motion Picture Producersâ€™ Association and daughter in-law of Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, believes Indian film industry is passing through a lean phase. â€œThough films are made after spending a lot of money, the producer gets very poor return,â€� she said while talking to TNN here on Thursday.

She held a meeting with the Bihar-based film distributors on Thursday. â€œ The situation is so bad that the distributors are not ready to accept new films. They are scared after a string of flop films in recent times,â€� she said.

She cited piracy as the major problem afflicting the film industry. â€œ The producers in Bihar are facing problems similar to other parts of the country. The government is not providing any incentive to the film producers anywhere in the country,â€� she said. Thackeray said she has urged RJD chief Laloo Yadav to promote the film industry in the state. â€œIf the government gives incentive to producers, they will certainly come to Bihar for shooting their pictures. It will also increase the revenue of the state government,â€� she said.

She said the condition of cinema halls in Bihar is miserable and there is an urgent need to impose an additional tax of Rs one for their proper maintenance. She added that Bihar has few cinema halls.

When asked about the growing popularity of RJD supremo Laloo Prasad in the film industry, she said he deserves it because he is a nice person. â€œHe has tremendous skills to communicate so he develops instant rapport with the masses,â€� Thackeray said.

The daughter in-law of Shiv Sena Supremo admitted that she, sometimes, uses her â€œpolitical cloutâ€� for the welfare of the film industry.

15,Vaiko needs court nod to vote in Prez polls: EC,"NEW DELHI: MDMK leader Vaiko, arrested under Pota for his pro-LTTE remarks, would have to take permission from appropriate court to be on parole to vote in the July 15 Presidential elections.

This was stated by Election Commission spokesman A N Jha when asked if the MDMK leader would be able to cast his vote in the Presidential elections.

""He (Vaiko) can vote in the elections subject to approval from competent court"", Jha said.

The EC official said Vaiko has already been granted permission in June to vote in Chennai.

Earlier, Vaiko''s lawyer said he would seek the Madras High Court''s permission to allow the MDMK leader vote in the Presidential election.

On Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa''s demand for banning MDMK, Deputy Election Commissoner Sayan Chatterjee said that he had not seen the report.

""Election Commission registers political parties under Section 29(A) of Representation of People''s Act (RPA). Let the event occur. It is hypothetical now"", he said adding ""recognition and de-recognition of political parties is the sole preserve of the Election Commission"".

16,EC announces steps for smooth conduct of J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Friday announced a series of measures for the smooth conduct of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir, including establishment of additional 900 polling booths and extension of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) facility to Kashmiri migrant voters settled in camps in Jammu and Delhi.

""These measures would go a substantial way in bringing about a good election in the state"", Deputy Election Commissioner Sayan Chatterjee told reporters.

Stating that political parties had represented to the Commission that ""clubbing"" of the polling stations had put the electorates to inconvenience, he said it has been decided to open booths at 900 additional locations.

Chatterjee said efforts would be made to ensure that as far as possible, voters would not be required to travel more than two kms to reach their polling stations and not more than three polling stations were located in one building.

He said that though the Kashmiri pandits, who migrated to various parts of the country, had the facility to vote by post, the Commission had received complaints that there was considerable delay in the transmission of these postal ballot to the Returning Officers.

""To obviate these difficulties and to make the voting right of these Kashmiri migrants more effective, the Commission has decided to extend the voting facility through EVM in their camps at Jammu and Delhi"", he said.

Chatterjee said the Kashmir Pandits would also have the option to vote by post. Further with a view to ensuring free and fair election in the state, the electoral rolls of all the 87 assembly constituencies in the state have been computerised in Urdu and copies of the same were being distributed free of cost to all recognised political parties in the state, he said.

Chatterjee said as a special case, and as a one time measure, the Commission has decided that all those registered unrecognised political parties in the state, which have legislative presence, would be supplied with one copy each of the electoral rolls free of cost.

This would mean that People''s Democratic Party, J and K Awami League and J and K National Panther''s Party would get this benefit.

He said there were complaints from political parties that leaders of ruling National Conference were provided with heavy security which enabled them to move around and undertake electoral campaigns and leaders of opposition parties were not enjoying any such privilege.

The Commission took up the issue with the Union Home Secretary and the Centre has now directed the State Government to provide security cover at the state cost to a leader of each recognised national and state party in each districts in the valley and in the districts of Doda, Rajouri, Poonch and Jammu, Chatterjee said.

18,Lyngdoh hints at early polls in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh has hinted at the possibility of early elections in Gujarat but said those who were talking of it had ""no authority"".

""There is no cause for action now. The Assembly exists. We are alive to the two -- Kashmir and Gujarat -- being put together. That''s all I can say. You can draw your own conclusion from that assuming we are sensible people,"" he said in an interview to a magazine.

The term of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly is due to end in October this year and polls are expected to be held by then. In Gujarat, the Assembly term is to expire in early 2003.

Lyngdoh, who was answering questions if polls would be advanced as was being suggested by Chief Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders, said, ""the people who talk of early elections have no authority. So, if it is a few mad people who keep talking of it, why should we bother?""

Regarding Kashmir, he said a clear assessment could not be made at present. ""We have worked with sincerity and tried to see that things are in order. But you can never say when matters can go wrong,"" he said, according to the weekly.

However, he said a free hand would be given to the media and diplomats to observe the polling and reiterated that there would be no official observers.

Lyngdoh said the business of conducting elections was the job of the Commission and the government in the state or the Centre have nothing to do with it.

On the Commission''s notification making it mandatory for politicians to disclose their income, educational qualification and criminal record while filing nominations, Lyngdoh said, ""there are some people who possibly would, and quite happily and unashamedly perform a striptease. There are others who might feel bad about it and get out of the contention altogether.

""Basically, this is a striptease act where you take off everything and are entirely exposed.""

Maintaining that the Commission was acting well within its jurisdiction, he said, ""if the EC did not have the jurisdiction, political parties could have taken us to court. Nobody has gone to court challenging our order. And the government also had plenty of opportunity to go to court. It didn''t.""

19,"Kerala minister lying on endosulfan, says activist","MANGALORE: With the Kerala government lifting the ban on endosulfan, activists are taking up the cause again. Sri Padre, leading the crusade, claims that all records and documents clearly show that Kerala Agriculture Minister Gowriamma was ``blatantly lying''''.

On July 4, minister Gowriamma had claimed in the Assembly that none of the studies have proved that endosulfan is the cause for diseases in these villages. She added that the state did not have the authority to ``ban'''' endosulfan, and that she has already ``prohibited'''' its use in PCK''s cashew plantations.

This was in reply to an urgent motion brought in by the Leader of the Opposition, V.S. Achuthanandhan, against the lifting of ban on endosulfan by the government in March this year.

Sri Padre said it has become clear that the government was playing into the hands of some vested interests, and wreaking havoc in Kasargod villages. Substantiating his claims, he quotes recommendations made by the Dr Achuthan Committee, which was instituted by the government to study the issue.

The committee, in one of its recommendations, says: ``Research efforts to evolve integrated pest management (IPM) should be augmented in view of the problems due to endosulfan.'''' Padre says the Government Order (GO) completely leaves IPM out, as IPM is a strategy to enable farmers to move away from chemicals and is ultimately detrimental to the interests of the manufacturers -- whom the agriculture ministry wants to protect.

The committee also recommends: ``Since the cause of the health problems could not be deduced conclusively, an investigation (should) be conducted to identify the risk factors and high morbidity in the affected areas. Since most of the people who complain about health problems are from poorer sections of the community, the government should make arrangements to provide special medical care.''''

Padre notes that the Government Order tactfully left out ordering anything regarding these two points as both would point out to accepting that there is a health problem. Also, there arises the problem as to who should pay the compensation: government, Plantation Corporation or endosulfan manufacturers.

Finally, the government withdrew the ban on the use of endosulfan for all crops and plantations in Kerala. This, Padre says, was not recommended by any of the committees.

A ``pesticide holiday'''' is also recommended in the villages of Kasargod for a period of five years. Interestingly, Muliyar village was included for a pesticide holiday in the Government Order so that Cherkulam Abdullah, Minister for Local Administration, who hails from Muliyar and who had taken a lot of interest in this issue, would not be offended. ``This is a very partisan, politically safe move by the agriculture ministry,'''' Padre maintains.

About Gowriamma''s statement that ``there is evidence that the health problems may be due to marriage between blood relations (consanguinity) and other traditional practices'''', Padre says, ``It (the statement) only adds insult to injury.''''

In fact, Kerala can take a lesson from the Assam government, which has banned the pesticide `demecron'' after it was found that wild elephants were dying due to poisoning. Sale and purchase of the pesticide is prohibited after it was reported that elephants were consuming crops sprayed with pesticide.

20,Muslim devotee pulls chariot,"VADODARA: It was quite an unusual sight. Something that astonished many who had gathered to see Lord Jagannath at his annual best here on Friday.

As the chariot of Lord Jagannath was being pulled out amid fanfare and festivity, it was a Muslim who was among the first ones to pull the chariot physically and prided in having participated in the ''devotional'' act alongside the Hindu devotees.

""I have been coming here for many years. It does not matter which community I belong to. I like what I am doing,"" Saiyyad said.

The call for a ''janta curfew'' did not deter Saiyyad, who came all the way from Chhani, from being among the first group of devotees to pull the chariot from its starting point near the railway station.

While Ahmedabad and the rest of the state were on tenterhooks, Vadodara threw pictures of communal harmony.

In Machhipith, one of the most sensitive areas of the city, Muslim community leaders ensured that the procession passed through peacefully. Children gathered on the terraces to watch the procession.

Enthusiastic crowds greeted the devotees all along the route, right from the railway station to the busy Raopura, Salat Wad, Nyaya Mandir and Dandia Bazaar areas. About 2,000 people participated in the procession that saw the lord riding atop a chariot carved out of wood and decked up with flowers and garlands.

An idol of Lord Jagananth was mounted on the rath. Devotees chanted hymns, some danced along, but most were seemingly gripped in a spiritual fervour.

Besides the common man, city politicians like Dalsukh Prajapati, Maulin Vaishnav of the Congress and several other functionaries of the BJP greeted the devotees. Police, RAF and other security personnel were on guard walking along the entourage till the procession culminated at the Polo ground.

City police commissioner D D Tuteja, joint commissioner P C Thakur and a horde of other senior police officers scouted the procession route to ensure that law and order was maintained.

However, even as the police deployment was visible, several people kept indoors, especially in the old city areas. Roads were deserted and many shops were closed. Many families did not send their children to school. Phones kept ranging constantly as the message of ''all''s well'' was relayed from one corner of the city to the other.

In the district, too, no untoward incident was reported. ""The procession has begun and would culminate by late evening. We have spoken to leaders from both the communities and asked them to be present when the procession passes through their areas,"" special IGP (Vadodara range) Deepak Swaroop told TNN.

Vadodara superintendent of police Piyush Patel, too, said that efforts were made to bring leaders of both the communities together. ""The procession is not a very big affair in the district. We have ensured that nothing goes wrong,"" Patel said.

21,Krishna comes to minister's defence,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S.M. Krishna lost his cool in the Legislative Council on Friday when the entire opposition demanded the resignation of Social Welfare Minister A. Krishnappa for his alleged involvement in the misappropration of funds in the City Municipal Councils (CMCs).

The House witnessed a verbal duel between the opposition and ruling parties members, including the CM, who defended his cabinet colleague.

``If you are targeting a minister, I am not going to oblige. I am sitting here as a leader and I will protect my minister. We have fought you (the opposition) and will continue to fight you,'''' Krishna said.

When the opposition insisted that Krishnappa quit office at least temporarily to ensure an impartial inquiry by the Lok Ayukta, Krishna shot back: ``This is a serious reflection on the Lok Ayukta''s image. He (Lok Ayukta) will not be influenced by anyone. Remember, the scam came to light due to the government''s initiative and not due to the opposition.''''

22,All-party meet on Cauvery in a week,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S.M. Krishna will convene an all-party meeting within a week to discuss Karnataka''s response to Tamil Nadu''s petition on Cauvery waters in the Supreme court.

Replying to JD(U) floor leader P.G.R. Sindhia, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister D.B. Chandre Gowda told the Assembly on Friday that TN''s petition is still ""at the admission stage."" ""Four days ago, the CM said we should hold an all-party meet and get the opposition''s views. We have been unable to do this due to paucity of time, but it will happen within a week.""

Water Resources Minister H.K. Patil said neither TN''s demands nor Karnataka''s stand was new. ""Our reservoirs are there for the benefit of our farmers. They are not balancing reservoirs for TN,"" he declared.

Patil said ""live"" capacity of the four Cauvery basin reservoirs __ Harangi, Hemavathi, Krishnarajasagar and Kabini __ was less than 11 tmcft. ""We ourselves are completely rattled over how to deal with this situation. TN CM Jayalalitha has unnecessarily gone to the Supreme Court. What better forum is there than the Cauvery River Authority (CRA) headed by the Prime Minister himself, to discuss this issue?"" he asked.

While Y.K. Ramaiah (Cong) accused TN of indulging in water politics, ""exactly like they have for 100 years,"" Sindhia contended that the Karnataka government was releasing water to TN from Kabini on the sly. ""The water to Biligundlu has to pass through Sangama, which is in my constituency Kanakapura. I have seen water flowing with my own eyes and you cannot claim this is due to seepage, because there is no water in the fields due to drought,"" he maintained.

Patil said he would take Sindhia to Kabini to show him the low water levels. ""When there is no water, where can we release it from?"" he asked, reiterating Krishna and Chandre Gowda''s recent statements on the issue.

Patil said Karnataka had released excess water to TN over the last two years. While the amount stipulated by the Central Water Commission (CWC) is 205 tmcft, Karnataka released 273.18 tmcft in 1999-2000 and 316.89 tmcft in 2000-2001.

In the present year, Karnataka had released 189.94 tmcft, Patil said, but pointed out that the reservoir storage position was very bad. ""Jayalalitha is bringing pressure on the Centre. I won''t go into why she does not want the CRA to meet. But we are doing our best to ensure our farmers'' welfare,"" he maintained.

23,Dreaded criminal arrested near India Gate,"NEW DELHI: The police have arrested an alleged criminal who is said to be responsible for over a dozen heinous crimes, including murder, attempted murder, kidnappings and extortion. Officials said the accused, Rajesh Yadav alias Munna, had committed most of his crimes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

The police laid a trap after head constable Anand Prakash received a tipoff that Rajesh would be coming to a place near India Gate to meet a contact on Thursday. When the 29-year-old was arrested, he was allegedly carrying a pistol.

During questioning, Rajesh reportedly told the police that he had completed his schooling in 1991 and took up admission in MJK College in Betia, Bihar. While living in the college hostel, he came in contact with local criminals and a year later he was committing crimes with them.

He had allegedly committed some highway robberies in UP with his accomplices when he was arrested for the first time in 1992. He was released but soon found himself behind the bars again in Deoria, UP, where he had allegedly gone to murder a rival gangster, Tiger Ramchander Yadav.

After his release from jail, he quit crime for some time. However, in 1997 a person by the name of Badku thrashed his younger brother. Rajesh allegedly tried to murder Badku but failed. However, he was forced to leave UP. He then joined the notorious Ramesh Rai gang and committed several crimes.

He said the polls would be held in the first week of October and the new government should be in place by October 13.

Omar said the NC is ready to contest the elections even under governorâ€™s rule as it has a mass support base in the state and would emerge victorious.

25,20 EC observers to monitor J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) is sending 20 senior officials from other parts of the country to Jammu and Kashmir from next week to monitor the coming elections to the state assembly.

This is in addition to the measures already announced, such as updating and computerisation, under ECâ€™s supervision outside the state, of the list of voters, in Urdu and English, and their distribution, free of cost, to all political parties, whether recognised or not.

26,BJP confused on how to play Vaiko's arrest,"NEW DELHI: The BJP is growing increasingly embarrassed over the arrest under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) of Vaiko, MDMK supremo and NDA partner.

If party president M Venkaiah Naidu said on Friday that his arrest â€˜â€˜was undesirable and unwarranted, as it would send a wrong signal about the legislationâ€™â€™, the partyâ€™s spin doctors are busy trying to deflect attention from the fact that Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa appears to have built a watertight case against Vaiko under a law that he himself helped to legislate.

The effort is to switch attention from the clauses in Pota to a search for a human approach to bringing disaffected and secessionist groups into the mainstream. A senior functionary, referring to the presence of Simranjit Singh Mann in the Lok Sabha, said: â€˜â€˜The success of our democracy lies in the fact that someone like Mann, with whom we disagree, is in Parliament. There is a need to look at the method of banning.â€�

Simultaneously, the criticism of Jayalalithaa â€” clearly a potential ally â€” has been measured. A senior BJP leader said: â€˜â€˜After all, Jayalalithaaâ€™s success lies in the fact that she has forced the MDMK to say that it opposes violence. She should have left it at that.â€™â€™

As for Pota itself, the line being taken is that one should only go by the spirit, not the letter of the law. â€˜â€˜Special laws should be used in an optimum way; they should not be overutilised. It is the action and not ideology that counts.â€™â€™ In other words, an unlawful action must be punished, but as citizens of a democracy, everyone has the right to his/her own ideology.

27,War widows decry pension rules,"NEW DELHI: Women, who were widowed during the 1965 and 1971 wars, and later remarried have petitioned the defence ministry against the discriminatory pension rules which denies them benefits normally extended to war widows.

The aggrieved women have written to the ministry drawing its attention to its liberalised pension rules, revised after the Kargil war, which seek to extend pension and other concessions to war widows, even if they remarried. It was understood that these concessions would also be applicable to widows of earlier wars.

However, the women complain that the revised scheme contains a clause stating that the liberalised pension scheme would not apply to war widows who remarried before 1996. But widows who did not get married or those who married their brothers-in-law are to get the benefits.

Addressing a Press conference on Wednesday, Mohini Giri of Guild of Service, who has taken up this case, said when the new pension rules were announced, widows of 1965 and 1971 operations felt they had not committed a crime by remarrrying outside their family and that they would be treated on a par with all war widows.

â€˜â€˜We want to know what crime we have committed by remarrying ....why should we be discriminated against,â€™â€™ said Jasjivan Kaur and Pushpa Arora, speaking on behalf of the aggrieved women.

Mohini Giri said it was with great difficulty that the young widows were persuaded to remarry but the message being sent out is that the nation approves levirate marriages, because it is within the patriachal parameters.

Meera Khanna of the Guild of Service said by introducing the cutoff date of 1996, the government is depriving the widows of 1965 and 1971 wars only because they remarried of their own choice and not to their brothers-in-law.

28,Left assails arrest of Nepalese activists,"NEW DELHI: The Left on Friday deplored the arrest of several activists from Nepal by the police here for taking part in a meeting with their Indian counterparts.

Leaders of the CPM, CPI, RSP and Forward Bloc termed the police action as arbitrary and undemocratic. They said those arrested were editors of well-known Nepalese journals, medical practitioners, writers and civil rights activists.

The meeting discussed how to restore the political process in the troubled areas of Nepal, the Left leaders said. â€˜â€˜This is an issue that directly concerns India and a large number of Indian people,â€™â€™ they said. The Left leaders held that such a meeting did not amount to any violation of law.

The police under BJP rule, they said, have been resorting to highhanded methods which are â€˜â€˜violative of elementary civil rights and symptomatic of fascist authoritarianism.â€™â€™ They said that the police had picked the Nepalese activists without arrest warrants or any other legal documents.

Among those who signed the statement were Harkishan Singh Surjeet, Sitaram Yechury (both CPM), A B Bardhan (CPI), Abani Roy (RSP) and Debabrata Biswas (FB).

29,RSS to support JNLF in Kashmir polls,"NAGPUR: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has decided to extend â€œmoral supportâ€� to the Jammu-Kashmir Nationalist Front (JNLF), a new political formation that will contest the forthcoming elections in the beleaguered state.

RSS national spokesman M.G. Vaidya told reporters here that the JNLF was in favour of statehood for Jammu which was also the demand of the RSS . â€œAny party favouring that idea will have our support,â€� Vaidya said. JNLF, an amalgam of nationalist parties, is in the midst of finalising its poll strategy and agenda, he disclosed.

Vaidya reiterated that the RSS was in favour of imposition of governorâ€™s rule in J&K during the elections. â€œThe RSS believes that free and fair elections cannot be held under the National Conference rule. Under governorâ€™s rule, there will be a definite rise in voter turnout,â€� he said.

Justifying the resolution passed by the RSS national executive at Kurukshetra for trifurcation of J&K,Vaidya noted, â€œThis was not a sudden decision, the resolution was passed after a three-member RSS team toured the state and studied the issue.â€�
