4,DPC for written undertaking from Maharashtra govt,"mumbai: us energy major enron''s dabhol power company has demanded a written undertaking from maharashtra government stating that it will not file a civil suit against the multinational as it was not a party to the power purchase agreement. ""any attempt by the government of maharashtra to file a civil suit agaisnt dpc in which the power purchase agreement is impeached, is precisely that which it undertook not to do as per the terms of the final consent award of december 1996"", dpc''s legal firm linklaters and alliance have said in a letter dated october 16 to maharashtra government''s lawyers m/s hariyani & co. referring to a media report, linklaters has warned maharashtra government that it was ""not and has not ever been a party to the power purchase agreement signed between dpc and maharashtra state electricty board"".

5,HCI told to expedite disinvestment process,"mumbai: the newly formed inter-ministerial group, set up to expedite the disinvestment of hotel corporation of india, a subsidiary of air india, has asked the undertaking to speed up the process by completing the necessary legal formalities. a top official of img has asked hci, at a meeting here last week, to complete the formalities required under the companies act for the sale of its properties and also getting approval of its board. though no deadline has been set, the department of disinvestment is keen that the entire process is completed by this yearend, hci sources said here on sunday. consequently, air india has been asked by img, which consists of officials from civil aviation ministry, dod and air india, to complete all paperwork which would be required for the sale proceeds, the sources said. the img, set up after it was delinked from air india board last month, has told hci to relocate its registered office from centaur hotel, mumbai airport, to another location, most probably at air india's engineering complex, at the old airport, so that the sale could be completed without further delay, the sources said. following this, the process of inviting financial bids for shortlisted bidders was well under way, they added. at least 12 bidders are in the fray for the two hotel properties at mumbai, and one each at delhi, rajgir and srinagar and two flight kitchens in mumbai and delhi. global advisors jardine fleming are coordinating in the disinvestment process. the civil aviation minister shahnawaz hussain has made it clear that the sale proceeds would go to air india which will enable it to repay part of its high cost of debts and save a substantial amount on interest costs. presuming that air india pays 12 per cent on its working capital loans within india (with its existing prime lending rate), the airline could save nearly rs 72 crore per annum by way of interest costs alone. this, sources said, would go to strengthen air india's financial position as well as its balance sheet.

6,Stable govt essential for welfare: PM,"new delhi: asserting that a stable government was essential for the development of the country, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee said on sunday that there were no differences among nda constituents, and the ruling alliance was marching ahead tackling internal and external challenges. ""a stable government is needed to tackle internal and external challenges for the welfare of the people and we are marching ahead with our partners"", vajpayee said at the golden jubilee celebrations of bjp here. vajpayee said when nda assumed power, people thought the government would not last but now they are convinced that it will continue. ""but this is not enough. there has to be some more speed,"" he said. stating that there were no internal differences among nda partners, he said every constituent of the ruling alliance had sacrificed some of its programmes and even bjp had done so. vajpayee said that bjp as an organisation should be strengthened further to meet various challenges. the prime minister said there was a communication gap between the party and the government as a result of which he could not attend the flag-hoisting session. skirting contentious issues like the terrorist strikes in the us, situation in jammu and kashmir and ayodhya, vajpayee said there were many challenges and ""still many goals have to be reached."" taking the audience down the memory lane, the prime minister, in his 20-minute speech, said when the performance of the organisation is reviewed, one does not get discouraged, but still there are many goals that have to be crossed. he said the success of bjp was reflected in the fact that it was carrying together 24 parties having their own ideologies and policies. he candidly admitted that the nda might not be fully experienced in governance, but the path it had chosen was right and the journey would not stop, as the motive was not narrow.

7,Land not the basis of persistent extremist violence,"patna: paradoxical as it may seem, the magadh division of bihar, which is scarred by extremist activities and is known as one of the most intensely affected belts in the counry, has the lowest number of pending ceiling-land cases in the state. the latest figures available with the revenue and land reforms department shows that this division has only 81 ceiling-land cases involving 6,229.49 acres of land, pending in different courts, from the court of deputy collector for land reforms (dclr) to the supreme court. incidentally, landlords are fighting 1,641 ceiling-land cases involving 1,28,262.48 acreas of land at various levels in 37 districts of the state, according to revenue and land reforms secretary k a h subramaniyam. purnia division tops the list of ceiling cases with a figure of 444 cases involving 23,228.48 acres of land, followed by tirhut having 420 pending ceiling-land cases. darbhanga comes third with 182 such cases and patna comes fourth with 165 number of pending cases, followed by kosi division with 144 pending cases. as far as the land involved in pending ceiling cases is concerned, darbhanga division tops with 33,829.34 acres of ceiling land, though it happens to be a smaller division consisting of just three districts -- darbhanga, madhubani and samastipur. in the tirhut division, the ceiling land involved is 33,386.48 acres, though it consists of six districts -- muzaffarpur, sitamarhi, vaishali, east champaran, west champaran and sheohar. purnia division is third in the list with 23,228.48 acres of land, while it has four districts -- purnia, kishanganj, katihar and araria. among districts, west champaran tops the list with 216 pending ceiling cases followed by purnia with 197 cases, while katihar is third with 144 cases. incidentally, the two divisions of bihar on the south of the ganga, patna and magadh, infamous for extremist violence, do not match with the number of pending ceiling land cases in districts north of the ganga. if the history of left extremism in undivided bihar is traced out, it surfaced first in the suryagarha block of the old munger district, then in chauradano block of the old champaran district and thereafter in mushahari block of muzaffarpur district in north bihar. at present, suryagarha falls in lakhisarai district, where the number of pending ceiling-land cases is only 36 involving 1,767.66 acres of land. in chauradano block the number of ceiling cases is 97 involving 5,245.67 acres of land. the mushahari block, where late jayprakash narayan (jp) had to camp to extinguish the fire of extremism, the number of pending ceiling-land cases is only 33 involving 2,063.07 acres of land.

9,"No party owns farmers, says Krishna","bangalore: in an indirect reference to former prime minister h.d. deve gowda's agitation against the government, chief minister s.m. krishna said on sunday that ``no single party owned farmers or their interests.'' speaking at the function to celebrate forest minister k.h. ranganath's 75th birthday, krishna said: ``people speak as though they own farmers. crying in front of farmers does not indicate anything. have farmers given general power of attorney to any party to address their issues?'' pointing out that the government has drawn several programmes for farmers' welfare, krishna maintained that all problems cannot be solved overnight. ``the problems are big, considering the huge population, but we are trying to solve them. you should support us and give suggestions,'' he stated. recalling his association with ranganath over the last 50 years, krishna said both of them had approached politics with a strong socialist philosophy and subsequently joined congress under the leadership of indira gandhi. ``we fought against adhocism and the politics of status quo, but the breakup of soviet union dealt a big blow to our dreams. we have hesitantly accepted global economy but are confident of a silver lining in the current gloomy atmosphere,'' he added. later, ranganath said the congress' historic role during the freedom movement had drawn him. ``for my socialist background, it was the ideal platform,'' he stated. on the neera controversy, ranganath said the government could not allow farmers to tap neera, which becomes toddy after sunrise. ``when toddy is banned, how can neera tapping be allowed?'' he asked and appealed to the farmers to support the government on the issue. earlier, inaugurating the programme, committee on reforms of criminal justice system chairman justice v.s. malimath, regretted the break down of ethics in the society and said it was rare to find honest and committed people. lok sabha deputy speaker p.m. sayeed released buddha pragne, a book in honour of ranganath amd rpi mp r.s. gavai, released a souvenir. administrative reforms commission and felicitation committee chairman harnahally ramaswamy spoke about the achievements of ranganath.

11,Painting in Delhi auction arouses museum's protests,"vadodara: for baroda museum and picture gallery here, a catalogue for auction of paintings in new delhi recently came as a shock. one of its painting housed in the gallery of contemporary art here was being displayed in the catalogue listing paintings to be auctioned by the internationally-famous bowring's fine art auctioneers private limited in new delhi on november 5. eminent artists from vadodara, who saw the catalogue, were shocked to find that a painting titled 'future?' by late n s bendre (erstwhile professor of painting at msu faculty of fine arts), housed at the museum here, was a part of the auction. it's prize pegged at rs 15 lakh! and, the painting being auctioned was titled 'kashmiri women'. following the revelation, bowring's fine arts auctioneers private limited deputy chairman patrick bowring rushed to the city with his own version of the painting (which was to be auctioned) to verify facts here on thursday. bowring plans to not only withdraw the painting from the auction but also investigate the matter. speaking to tnn museum director t l chauhan said: ""the painting that mr bowring brought with him bore a close resemblance to the one that the museum houses. but close observation by experts and eminent city artists revealed that there were clear differences between the two. ""the painting we have is technically and artistically superior than the one that mr bowring brought with him. there were colour differences in the paintings. the brush strokes used in patrick's painting appeared weaker than the one in the painting that we have. we think mr bowring's painting is a copy,"" said chauhan. sources reveal there could be two possibilities. one is that there might have been an attempt to replicate the original painting to sell it off as an original. another possibility is that the painting was a harmless copy made for personal use (this has happened with several paintings in the past), but might have somehow made its way to the auction. ""either way, what is surprising is that the bowring's fine art auctioneers private limited could not identify a fake,"" said a source on condition of anonymity. according to sources, if there is one painting which is being passed off as original, there could be others that might be similarly replicas. however, it is also possible that the replica with the bowrings is not a result of attempted fraud. the differences in the two paintings are too obvious. somebody who tries to fraud or replicate and pass his copy as an original would do so with utmost care to ensure that there are no obvious difference. but in this case the differences are obvious. there are changes in colour tones of the two paintings, the size of the paintings too is different. furthermore the painting at the baroda museum is done on hard board and the one brought by bowring is done on oil canvas. ""but strangely, on examination of mr patrick's painting we found that some materials such as canvas, stretcher and frame were tampered with. the canvas, stretcher and frame do not seem original,"" said chauhan.

16,Tough times ahead for foul players of biennial polls,"patna: for the last many years, both — the process involved in holding biennial elections in teachers' constituencies of the legislative council and the results thereof — have been criticised on several counts. this time, however, those who have been indulging in the use of unfair means to enrol fake voters in the electoral rolls for influencing results of biennial elections in teachers' constituencies may have tough time. for, with an eye on to preventing enrolment of fake voters in the electoral rolls to be prepared for the teachers' constituencies in the state this year, bihar's chief electoral officer (ceo) n s madhavan has issued a fresh circular last tuesday. the biennial elections to the legislative council are scheduled to be held on april 28 next year. the constituencies fall in patna, saran, tirhut, darbhanga and purnia divisions. according to the new circular, senior concerned officials, including secretaries of higher education, secondary education, science and technology and labour employment and training departments as well as special director of secondary education have been instructed to religiously follow guidelines issued by the election commission (ec). all the officers concerned have been asked to provide a list of government recognised educational institutions, which have been identified by the offices of the ceo and the state election office (sec) vide their separate notifications issued on september 4 this year and november 27, 1996, respectively. the lists have to be sent to divisional commissioners who happen to be election returning officers (eros) for the biennial elections in teachers' constituencies. only teachers working in government recognised educational institutions and duly identified by the office of the ceo and sec are eligible for their enrolment in voters' list. further, teachers to be enrolled as voters must have been appointed legally and also against the sanctioned posts. moreover, preparation of voters' list has to be a timebound programme and is to be completed by november 6. accordingly, the ceo has directed the officers concerned to provide lists of state recognised educational institutions and teachers (appointed legally and also against sanctioned posts working in these institutions) to the divisional commissioners of patna, saran, tirhut, darbhanga and purnia.

17,Man held in a muddle of laws,"new delhi: the police have arrested a businessman under a law that is yet to be notified. the mistake was admitted in a court which later granted bail to accused mahinder singh. ''the prosecution has admitted that the arrest was made under an act which has not been enforced,'' said additional sessions judge mahavir singhal while granting bail on friday. singh was arrested on october 11 for allegedly selling fake purolator oil filters at kashmere gate. the police charged singh under the trademarks act, 1999, and the trade and merchandise marks act, 1958. besides, the accused was also charged with cheating and forgery. he was in judicial custody since his arrest. while arguing for singh's bail, his counsel, dhanbir singh, claimed on thursday that the trademarks act, 1999, was not officially notified. ''the sections of the 1958 act as well as the new one are for the same offences, which my client has allegedly committed. the difference is that the accused cannot be released on bail if charged under the new law,'' he pointed out. after hearing the bail application, the additional sessions judge sought an explanation from the state counsel and investigating officer, sub-inspector dinesh dahiya. the prosecutor told the court on friday that if the new act was not notified then the state would pursue the case under the existing one. the judge, however, observed: ''the offence under the existing act is bailable therefore the accused is released on a bail bond of rs 20,000 and a surety of the same amount.'' although joint commissioner of police, crime branch, k k paul was unware of the case, he said: ''anybody arrested for selling fake products is charged with cheating under the trade and merchandise marks act, 1958. the other act is yet to be notified so we do not charge the accused under it.''

18,Expensive fight for a principle,"new delhi: a rs 50-fine could have settled the case. but for two businessmen from east delhi their reputation mattered more. shyam sunder aggarwal and his friend vijay sharma spent rs 50,000 and visited the karkardooma courts 64 times over five years, all to prove their innocence. it was an expensive and a harrowing journey. but that did not affect the duo's determination to fight. ''our family and friends discouraged us. sometimes even we were disheartened. the court had twice issued non-bailable warrants after we failed to reach on time. the thought of paying the fine to get over the case often crossed our minds,'' said aggarwal. the two now are glad that the deliberations did not overtake their willpower. last month a city court discharged them. while co-accused ganesh and raj kishore paid the fine, aggarwal and sharma did not. ''paying the fine would have disgraced us. ganesh and kishore could not afford to challenge the case. but we did,'' aggarwal said. on march 13, 1996, sharma, aggarwal, ganesh and kishore were charged under the delhi police act. head constable anand singh said the four had quarrelled at a bus stop in geeta colony. a month later, sharma and aggarwal made their first apperance in court. when they claimed that the police had lodged a false case, the judge directed the deputy commissioner of the district police to conduct an inquiry. the report of the inquiry exonerating sharma and aggarwal was submitted to the court after a month. ''in 1996, the court hearings were quick,'' said aggarwal. ''there were 20 dates in eight months.'' the judge finally kept november 26, 1996, for final orders. but in 1997, when the judge changed, the proceedings stalled. the two visited the court five times just to make an appearance. ''this was directed by the judge. another five dates were spent to argue the matter,'' said aggarwal. the case was finally kept for final orders on december 31, 1997. from then till august 2000 sharma and aggarwal went to court in anticipation of hearing the final order. ''it never happened. in 1998, we went to court on eight dates and in 1999 on seven occasions. last year, the court called us five times,'' aggarwal said. for three years — 32 dates — the duo reached the court at 10 in the morning. each visit meant a day wasted. but the precaution was necessary. ''warrants had already been issued against us. we did not want to take a chance,'' aggarwal said.

19,"PM admits there is rift between party, govt","new delhi: it was an inauspicious start to the year-long festivities to celebrate the bjp's 50 years, first as the jan sangh and then as the bjp. prime minister vajpayee, one of the handful who founded the jan sangh, which grew from a humble party in 1951 to political centrestage by 1998, failed to show up at the flag-hoisting ceremony because of a ``communication gap''. fifty years of bjp arriving at the party national council at the talkatora stadium here two hours late, vajpayee apologised for having missed the ``shubhaarambh''. ``i was under the impression that (lk) advani was to provide the margdarshan and i was to make the concluding speech. maybe i misunderstood, maybe there was a communication gap. maybe this happened because once you are in power, the distance between the party and the government grows. and so i was not there for the flag-hoisting ceremony.'' bjp sources, however, stress that a copy of the programme, starting with the flag-hoisting which was to be done by the pm himself, was sent to the pmo and that if there was a gaffe, it was because of a gap between the pmo and the pm. the pmo, on its part, is silent on the issue. and when the pm did not show up, party president k jana krishnamurthy hoisted the party flag. indeed, but for the pm's frontal attack on the party, which, as party observers point out, coincides with his successful marginalisation of krishnamurthy, who is considered close to advani, the speeches made by the home minister and the pm were complementary. advani, on his part, concentrated on a historical account of the jan sangh, setting it against the political backdrop of the period, describing how it evolved from being one of the political parties in the country to the alternative to the congress, cautioning against any efforts to ``better the congress. what people want is an original bjp.'' coinciding with the return of ayodhya to the headlines, advani stressed,``if we hadn't talked of cultural nationalism, of which the ramjanmabhoomi movement is the symbol, we would not have got here. it encapsulated our ideology and gave us an identity.'' indeed, other senior leaders like former party chief kushabhau thakre and j p mathur, who also spoke, also dwelt on ``cultural nationalism''. if advani addressed those who want ``an original bjp'', vajpayee decided to speak to those who are a little uncomfortable with it. saying advani had detailed the history of the jan sangh and bjp, he spoke of the political stability that the coalition he heads has given the country, with each of the 24 parties jettisoning part of its individual ideologies to frame a common national agenda. ``no one is any more asking how long this government will last, because everyone feels it will last its full term. that is our strength, unifying everyone. we will take all sections of society with us so that we can face internal and external challenges. we have done well, but a great deal remains to be done,'' he stressed.

20,"<font color=red size=-1 style=""text-decoration:none"">LEGAL VIEW </font><br>Can the charge of abetment to suicide stick always?","new delhi: if a person commits suicide, he cannot be tried. but, if he or she makes an attempt to commit suicide, the offender is hauled up and faces trial for violating section 306 of the indian penal code. but the moot question is whether along with the person who made an unsuccessful suicide attempt, the abetter named in the offence could also be tried. in fact, abetment to commit suicide is an unusual offence, unparalleled in criminal law. recently a married woman became handicapped after she made an abortive bid to end her life by throwing herself before a running train. she accused her in-laws and husband of harassing her. the husband and aged in-laws were tried and sentenced by the trial court and the high court on the charge of cruelty over dowry. but, the accused got a reprieve from the supreme court which acquitted them. section 306 says:``if any person commits suicide, whoever abets it, shall be punished with imprisonment ... upto 10 years ...''. under the ipc, the person who attempted to commit suicide is guilty of the offence whereas the person who committed suicide cannot be reached at all. section 306 renders the person who abets punishable with the condition precedent that suicide should necessarily have been committed. it is possible to abet the commission of suicide but it would be preposterous if law could afford to penalise an abetment to the offence or mere attempt to commit suicide. a bench, comprising justice k t thomas and justice s n variava, said, if there is no abetment there is no question of the offence under section 306 coming into play. ``it is inconceivable to have abetment of an abetment'' , the court said. it also failed to understand as to how the accused could be sentenced for cruelty when there was dearth of evidence to link the demand for dowry with the women's suicide attempt. after all what is dowry? section 304b of ipc defines `dowry' as any property of valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by one party to marriage or by the parents of the party or by any other person to the other party at or any time after the marriage. but dowry does not include `mehr' in cases relating to marriages solemnised under the muslim personal law (shariat). sometime ago, the then apex court judges justice k ramaswamy and justice b l hansaria (now dead) said it was a crime to demand dowry before marriage, at the time of marriage and after marriage. ``greed being limitless, the demands become insatiable in many cases, followed by torture on the girl, leading to either suicide in some cases or murder in some,'' the court noted. a large number of aged men and women accused of murdering their daughters-in-law over dowry are reportedly languishing in jails across the country. should the charge of ``dowry death'' be liberally accepted? or should the charge, howsoever grave it is, stand the test of certain guidelines? these include: death of a married woman should be by burns or bodily injury; second, it must have occurred within seven years of her marriage; third, soon before her death, she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or by his relatives ; last, such cruelty or harassment must be or in connection with dowry demands.
