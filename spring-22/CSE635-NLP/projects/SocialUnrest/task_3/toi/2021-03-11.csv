0,Stage-on-wheels gets election rallies rolling,"MUMBAI: Milind Soman has strutted down its length, Daler Mehndi has sung on it and now itâ€™s Sonia Gandhiâ€™s turn to hold forth to the masses from its height. Make way for the stage on wheels, or the SOW, the new election gizmo in great demand by political parties.

This amazing mobile stage can be set up within two hours with hydraulic pumps, and its height can be adjusted according to the strength of the crowd â€” the bigger the crowds the higher the stage.

Rajendra Savla, director of the SOW, has been flooded with queries for his moveable 40-by-40 stage for big political road shows. The most difficult part of organising an election rally is knocking a stage together. An army of carpenters and electricians has to be hired, and one can almost predict that the mikes will fail you at the crucial moment. These problems are obviated by SOWs which come equipped with sound and light facilities.

Launched in 1999, the SOW has been used extensively by the entertainment industry. It has toured Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra and been used for fashion shows, music concerts and programmes organised by music channels. For the first time, political parties are also queuing up, Mr Savla told TNN on Wednesday.

This year, an SOW was used in Mumbai for a political rally for the first time when Congress president Sonia Gandhi addressed a meeting at Shivaji Park. Before Ms Gandhi arrived the stage was used by an entertainment troupe to belt out patriotic songs. Struck by the convenience of the stage, political parties have since queued up to hire it.

Savla says an SOW can be set up at the push of a button.

1,"'Attack on PIB to sabotage talks, polls'","NEW DELHI: The objective behind the escalation of violence and militant attacks on civilian and official targets in J&K like the one on PIB building in Srinagar is to sabotage the Centre-Hurriyat talks and the LS elections, say Intelligence officials.

The attack on the PIB building virtually gutted the 80-year-old building and destroyed property worth crores of rupees. The library of state information department housing historical archives, rare video footage and photo clippings dating back to 1947 too were destroyed or damaged.

Besides making headlines, the LeTâ€™s objective by attacking the PIB building on Residency Road is to convey a grim message to central and state officials, election commission staff, the media and the public at large not to take elections seriously.

Intelligence officials point out that jehadi elements operating in J&K appear to be undeterred by Pakistanâ€™s ISI claim of distancing itself from the terrorist groups, operating here.

However, intercepts of terrorist talks on either side of the border indicates that militants this side are being directed not to claim responsibility for their acts. That is why instead of terrorist groups like LeT or Jaish-e-Mohammad names of Al Mansurian etc are figuring these days.

Security personnel sayd that with the announcement of LS polls, the pro-Pakistan jihadi elements are helbent on creating an atmosphere of fear and insecurity in the state.

The attempt is also to pressurise the moderate Hurriyat Conference of Maulana Abbas Ansari from walking out of the negotiations with the Centre, and also to bring discredit to the chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government.

2,Patil suspects foul play in stars joining politics,"MUMBAI: Suspecting some foul play in the television and film stars joining the political bandwagon, Maharashtra Home Minister R R Patil on Wednesday said the state government would inquire into the matter if it receives any written complaint.

Patil, responding to media reports that the film and television artists were joining the political parties for monetary benefit, said he suspected foul play as there has been a sudden rise in the number of such personalities joining political parties.

""The state government would inquire into the matter if there is a written complaint about it,"" the state home minister told reporters.

Patil said it is learnt that the filmstars which have failed to pay high Income Tax returns with the fear of action are joining political parties to avoid it.

He further said the film and television personalities should pay their income tax returns to the country before going for public service.

3,Student suicide over 'tough' English paper,"KOLKATA: Opposition MLAs raised a storm over Tuesdayâ€™s Madhyamik English question paper at the state Assembly on Wednesday even as reports came in from Midnapore that a candidate committed suicide by hanging himself.

Samir Mondal of Nabkola High School in the Chandrakona Road police station area of West Midnapore said in his suicide note that he was being forced to take the step because he had performed miserably in his English paper.

The MLAs dubbed the paper as â€œtoughâ€� and â€œfull of errorsâ€�. The legislators demanded that the English answer scripts be examined liberally and grace marks be given to prevent mass failure. Even a member of the ruling CPM demanded school education minister Kanti Biswasâ€™ explanation on the floor of the House. The Congress and SUCI brought separate adjournment motions demanding a probe.

A day after the English examination, president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education Dibyendu Hota admitted that there were â€œsomeâ€� mistakes in the question paper.

â€œWe are ashamed of this. It shouldnâ€™t have happened. We will set up an inquiry committee and find out who was the culprit,â€� Hota said, apologising profusely. Teachersâ€™ associations called his gesture a â€œshamâ€�. â€œHow can he ignore two glaring errors in one sentence on the day of the exam and admit it the next day? Why does he require teachers to point out these errors?â€� asked Secondary Teachers and Employees Association secretary Ratan Laskar.

The Board did not escape the wrath of the CPM-backed All Bengal Teachersâ€™ Association, too. â€œThe Board should have thought about the first generation examinees and the large number of rural students before setting such a difficult question paper. â€œMost students in the districts did not even understand the meaning of some words in the writing skills portion,â€� complained Amal Bandyopadhyay, secretary of ABTA.

Commenting on the suicide, Hota said, â€œThis is most unfortunate. Stu-dents should not break down so easily as exams are not the end of life.â€� The Board has also decided to form a committee with its 544 head exam iners to find out if the English paper was â€œreallyâ€� tough. â€œIf this is proved, we will see that studentsâ€™ interests are protected,â€� promised Hota.

Another student from Midnapore, Chhotu Sutradhar of Ramjibanpur Ba-bulal Institute, was knocked down by a motorbike while he was returning home after the examination. He was taken to the Ghatal Sub-divisional Hospital.

Though critically hurt, he insisted that he would still give the examination from the hospital. Arrangements were made for him by the district administration and Chhotu wrote his history paper while being given blood and saline.

4,Marandi not to contest LS election this time,"RANCHI: Former chief minister, Babulal Marandi has expressed his unwillingness to contest elections, at least for the time being, putting to rest all speculations about his candidature from Dumka or Koderma.

Talking to TNN after a meeting of the state election campaign committee on Wednesday, the national vice-president of BJP, said that in this election he would prefer to work wholeheartedly for the party as a true worker rather than jump into the fray himself.

Marandi had defeated JMM chief Shibu Soren in Dumka in 1998 and Sorenâ€™s wife, Rupi Soren in 1999 and was hence being considered a suitable candidate for the seat.

While speaking, he challenged all opposition parties including JMM to win the Dumka seat saying that he would do everything a worker is supposed to do to make the party candidate win the election. He will leave no stone unturned on his part, he said.

When reminded, that despite his campaign in parliamentary byelections, JMM chief, Shibu Soren had bagged the seat, Marandi replied that he had not given much time to campaigning due to his preoccupation as CM but this time he was free.

Meanwhile, Union external affairs minister and state election campaign committee chief, Yashwant Sinha after convening a meeting of the committee on Wednesday morning said that the party would launch a ""carpet bombing"" campaign in Jharkhand from April 4.

The day is being seen as an auspicious day for its numbers (4.4. 04).

It will also be clear by April 3 as to which candidate will be fielded against whom.

The party would hold as many as 100 meetings all over the state on that day, in which central leaders would also participate, said Sinha.

The state BJP has recommended the names of all the 11 sitting MPs for candidature in the forthcoming elections while leaving the final decision on the central election committee which would also decide the nominees for the rest of the three seats.

A delegation of JD(U) leaders including Gautam Sagar Rana, Ramchander Kesri, Madhu Singh and Lalchand Mahto also met Sinha with their demand to contest at least 4 of the 14 LS seats.

5,I-T dept adopts carrot and stick policy,"CHANDIGARH: With a few weeks to go before the end of the current fiscal year, the Chandigarh regional office of the income tax department has adopted a carrot and stick policy towards corporates and traders apparently aimed at mopping up an additional Rs 200 crore target set by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for it in mid-February.

Sources said while the surveys on groups of enterprises were continuing at a brisk pace, the commissioners of ranges were meeting delegations of associations of industrialists and traders in an attempt to persuade them to appeal to their members to maximise payment of advance tax.

Senior I-T officials are learnt to be emphasising on the leaders of various associations during the meetings that the department had adopted a very liberal stance towards them by doing away with regular scrutiny of their returns and taking them on their word.

Also the discretion of the officials had been minimised and the system of refunds had been streamlined and speeded up. In the light of this friendly approach of the department, the tax payers should pay advance tax and returns honestly.

This had not been happening, the sources said adding that real incomes were still being concealed, forcing the department to simultaneously continue with the surveys to keep up the pressure on the tax payers.

A day after a delegation of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal met I-T commissioner Manju Lakhanpal, it was the turn of the Chamber of Chandigarh Industries to meet her on Wednesday.

Following the meeting, chamber president Vinod Mittal appealed to its members to ""sincerely and faithfully deposit enhanced amount of advance income tax by March 15.""

6,Verma rules out extension to finance secy,"CHANDIGARH: UT administrator O P Verma has turned down a proposal sent by his adviser Lalit Sharma, seeking extension of the deputation of finance secretary Karan A Singh, whose tenure ends in July.

In fact, how keen the administration is to retain the finance secretary is demonstrated by the fact that UT officials had even sent a subsequent proposal to Verma, asking for his stamp of approval to grant extension to Singh.

However, Verma has rejected the proposal for a second time, making it clear that no extension would be granted to Singh.

The finance secretary had joined the administration in 2001 on a two-year deputation period. After his deputation ended last year, his term was extended by a year.

However, the administration would still put forward his name to the Cabinet Committee for Appointments (ACC), hoping that he is granted an extension.

The administration would communicate to the ministry of home affairs that Verma has decided against granting extension to Singh and that a fresh panel would be obtained from Punjab.

But a UT official said, ""The case will be put up before the ACC, but its decision cannot be taken for granted. In fact, the committee may not even take a decision as has happened in the case of the Municipal Corporation commissioner.""

In case Karan A Singh has to go, the ministry of home affairs would also have to seek the concurrence of the Election Commission as the finance secretary also holds the charge of the chief electoral officer.

7,DAV hosteller commits suicide,"CHANDIGARH: Ravi Sharma, a class XII student of DAV College, committed suicide here on Wednesday.

He was found hanging from the ceiling fan of his hostel room in the afternoon. Hostel authorities said that according to other hostellers, the boy had committed some petty thefts a few days ago, and was possibly scared of punishment.

That his hostel mates suspected him of another theft, seems to have introduced another element of pressure.

The incident came to light when Vishal, another resident of the hostel, broke the window pane of the room after the door was not openeddespite repeated hailing.

The authorities further said that the students had not informed them about the thefts and were trying to solve the problem themselves.

In a suicide note left behind, the deceased mentioned that he had stolen Rs 1,000 and three books of

a certain Aditya which he later returned.

He also mentioned that his two close friends Raju and Teetu now suspected him of stealing Rs 2,500.

The boy refuted the fresh allegation and pleaded with his friends to forgive him for the earlier indiscretions. Sharma was appearing in the ongoing CBSE board exam and had already taken the Physics and Biology papers.

His teachers and friends said that he was an average student but faced no major problem with his studies. The boy is a native of Dhaulpur, Kullu. His family has been informed about the incident.

It is learnt that his mother and elder brother have already star ted for Chandigarh.

The principal of the College, S C Marriya, said that one of the security officers informed him about the incident at about 3 pm when he was in a meeting.

""We rushed to the spot, but the student was already dead. Doctors and police were also called immediately.""

A meeting of the hostellers was called wherein the teachers advised them to bring all problems to their notice immediately in the future.

10,Record increase in excise revenue due to DP Yadav,"BATHINDA: Amidst the talk of UP''s strongman DP Yadav and a sitting Congress MLA and a former legislator jumping in the liquor trade of the area, the auctioning of liquor shops in Bathinda district registered an unprecedented hike in the excise revenue for year 2004-2005.

In the auctioning of Bathinda, Mansa and Faridkot districts held here on Thursday, Bathinda district registered maximum increase of 5.7 per cent in excise revenue for the ensuing fiscal year. Against revenue of Rs 54.41 crore last year, this year the liquor shops went for Rs 57.51 crore in Bathinda, registering an increase of Rs 3.10 crore.

The Faridkot district also registered record hike in increase of excise revenue in auctioning of liquors shops. Against the revenue of Rs 29.83 crore last year, Malhotra & Company was able to retain its hold on the liquor business in Faridkot district with an increase of Rs 1.69 crore. The auction for Faridkot district went for Rs 31.52 crore, registering an increase of about 5.6 per cent this year.

While there was a lot of hullabaloo for a minor increase in excise revenue for the districts of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, and Amritsar for the presence of Ponty Chadha, Bathinda and Faridkot districts registered maximum hike in the excise revenue over the state for the reasons of DP Yadav and two Congress party leaders-Amrik Singh Dhillon, Congress MLA from Samrala and Harminder Singh Raikot, a former MLA, revealed sources in liquor business.

The extraordinary hike in the excise revenue here has its reason in the talks of DP Yadav and two senior Congress party leaders have their keenness in joining liquor business of the area.

Despite tough competition among the contractors, quoting high prices, Malhotra & Company retained its hold in Faridkot. But in Bathinda circle a new party-Jatinder Singh & Company-was able to get the liquor shops. The sources revealed that in Jatinder Singh & Company, DP Yadav and two Congress leaders have major share

At the start of auctioning here, some liquor contractors including on Shiv Lal complained to deputy commissioner Bathinda about them being issued threats for not giving bids in the auctioning. On the assurance of deputy commissioner, the contractors were asked to give auction without any fear.

Some liquor contactors alleged that the senior officers in the excise department had directed them to not participate in the auction under the dictations of Congress leaders so they had informed the deputy commissioner. However, the excise department authorities declined any direction to the contractors and claimed that it was open and fair auction, which earned the department highest revenue.

For Mansa district, the auctioning of liquor shops fetched a marginal increase of 1.8 per cent. Against Rs 26.95 crore revenue of last year, this year the liquor business in Mansa got the state government Rs 27.43 crore.

There was tight security at Jeet Palace, the auction venue. The media persons faced a lot of difficulty in getting entry to the auctioning spot.

11,Gujarat farmers step up attack on Modi,"GANDHINAGAR: If there is one section of society which the BJP is completely unsure of in Gujarat even as it readies for the Lok Sabha elections, it is the farmers.

With even peasant organisations, owing allegiance to the Sangh Parivar, upset with the Narendra Modi government, the impact of a state-wide bandh, called by the Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) today, will be closely observed for political rather than agrarian reasons.

While the GKS has announced support to the Congress in the coming elections, it is the reaction of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) to the agitation which will evince interest in both the Congress and BJP.

The BKS, being backed by former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, was forced to abandon its agitation over the power tariff issue last month following intervention of the top RSS leadership.

However, there are many within the BKS who are not happy with the token relaxation granted by the Modi government. â€˜â€˜Many farmers have not forgotten the manner in which the BKS was evicted out of its temporary headquarters in Gandhinagar by the Modi government which wanted to crush our agitation,â€™â€™ said a senior BKS leader.

Even BJP leaders admitted that though the BKS cadres may not turn entirely against them, their support can no longer be taken for granted in constituencies in North Gujarat and Saurashtra where it has considerable strength. The BKS had gone to the extent of threatening to disrupt Modiâ€™s Republic Day function in Jamnagar before calling off the stir under pressure.

Already, in several districts like Kutch, Surendranagar, Banaskantha, Patan, Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Gandhinagar where the BKS had organised a powerful agitation against power tariff hike, the farmers remained restive as they felt the agreement between the government and BKS was not to their satisfaction.

Complained BKS spoke-sperson Kanubhai Patel, â€˜â€˜The agreement was reached with the ruling BJP under Sangh Parivar pressure. Things have not changed for farmers.â€™â€™ He said though the agitation had raised several issues, only the issue of power tariff was partly tackled.

Modiâ€™s last-ditch efforts to woo the farming community has come in the form of the Rs 6,088 crore Sujalam-Sufalam scheme. However, it is still unclear how the government plans to generate funds for the project which is to be completed in just two years.

Lalshankar Upadhaya, vice-president of the GKS and executive member of National Farmersâ€™ Co-ordination Committee said, â€˜â€™The bandh is being organised by farmers of the state to oppose the autocratic and anti-farmer polices of the Modi government. If the government still does not find a permanent solution to our problems, then we will show our magic in the forthcoming elections.â€™â€™

12,Ayodhya solution likely after polls: Advani,"KOTTAYAM: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani said on Thursday the Ayodhya issue was likely to be resolved after the elections.

Responding to queries at his first press conference after his countrywide Bharat Uday Yatra began from Kanyakumari on Wednesday, Advani said the issue had not been â€œdumped.â€�

â€œThere is unanimity in opinion that the solution can come by two means, through discussion or a judicial verdict. We have done some groundwork in the past six months and I surely hope it will bear fruit soon,â€� Advani said.

Advani laughed at the Opposition charge that some poll material was flown by Air Force planes. â€œWhen they (IAF) had refused to fly me, where is the question of lifting material?â€� he asked.

â€œOnly our critics,â€� he said, â€œhave doubts about Indiaâ€™s progress in the recent past. Even I was surprised when I read a report by the London School of Business that 17 million jobs were created in India in 2003 alone.â€�

He said the biggest achievement of the Vajpayee government had been in dispelling the cyni-cism about things never improving.

The chalta hai philosophy sired by the prolonged Congress rule had damaged the national psyche, he charged, adding, today, things have changed for the better.

The country was economically vibrant, energised to move towards its destiny and commanded international respect. All this, said Advani, had made the Opposition schizophrenic. Asked about the Opposition charge on his yatraâ€™s potential to generate social hatred, Advani said it was a political exercise done only to highlight good governance and development wrought by the Vajpayee government.

For that matter, he never believed any of his yatras in the past had encouraged hatred and tension, he said. The 1990 yatra was to expose the pseudo-secularism of the Congress in the Shah Bano case and the aftermath and the 1997 one had sought a mandate for a change, for a better India, he said.

13,State farmers giving BJP nightmares,"GANDHINAGAR: If there is one section of society which the BJP is completely unsure of in Gujarat in the build-up to the Lok Sabha elections, it is the farmers.

With even peasant organisations owing allegiance to the Sangh Parivar unhappy with the Narendra Modi government, the impact of a state-wide â€˜bandhâ€™ called by the Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) on Friday will be closely observed for political, rather than agrarian reasons.

But while the GKS has already announced support to the Congress in the coming elections, it is the reaction of the still-smarting Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) to the agitation which will be watched in both the Congress and the BJP. The BKS, which was backed by former CM Keshubhai Patel, was forced to abandon its agitation over the power tariff issue last month.

Complains BKS spokesperson Kanubhai Patel, â€œThe agreement was reached with the ruling BJP under Sangh Parivar pressure. Things have not changed for the farmers.â€�

BJP sources say that even active sabotage by the BJP is not ruled out to teach the Modi government a lesson.

There are reports that senior BKS functionary Prafull Senjalia, known to be close to Keshubhai, is trying to pull down Dilip Sanghani, a Modi confidant, who is likely to be renominated from Amreli.

Modiâ€™s last-ditch eforts to woo the farmers has come in the form of the Rs 6,088-crore Sujalam-Sufalam scheme. However, it is still unclear from where the government plans to generate funds for the project which is to be completed in just two years.

Lalshankar Upadhaya, vice-president of the GKS and executive member of National Farmersâ€™ Co-ordination Committee, said, â€œThe bandh is being organised by the farmers to oppose the autocratic and antifarmer polices of the Modi government. If the government still does not find a permanent solution to our problems, then we will show our magic in the elections.â€�
