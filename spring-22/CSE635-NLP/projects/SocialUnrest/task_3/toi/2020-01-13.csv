0,Shrine desecration engineered for political gain: Laloo,"GAYA: RJD leader and former chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav has accused the Hindutva brigade of hatching a conspiracy to engineer large-scale communal divide and said that the vandalisation of shrines in Gaya was part of a larger political design. Talking to media persons at the Gaya Circuit House on Saturday evening, the former chief minister said that as the elections draw closer more such incidents were likely to take place.

Harping on the conspiracy theory, the RJD chief said that the real game plan was to grab power by causing turmoil and promoting hatred between different communities. But the people can no longer be subjected to emotional blackmail as the common man has now become wise enough to see through the design. Earlier, Yadav visited the shrines vandalised by the miscreants.

This is just the beginning and as the elections draw closer, the merchants of hate were likely to invent new techniques to engineer polarisation along communal lines, Yadav said. He also claimed that the culprits of the Gaya shrine incidents were being identified and strong action would be taken against them.

Asked about the possibility of RJD workers being mobilised to respond to such situations in the future, Yadav said that the maintenance of law and order was the responsibility of the state agencies and the RJD workers were only expected to educate the people about the designs of those who were trying to cover up their own failures through diversionary tactics.

DCC vice-president Md Moosa met Yadav in the Gaya Circuit House and demanded strong action against the handful of agent provocateurs who were trying to create trouble in the town. Yadav assured Moosa that action will be taken against the culprits.

Later, inaugurating the 5th Buddha Mahotsava, the RJD chief said that people were getting converted to Buddhism on account of the shortcomings of the Brahminical order.

Buddha followers, too, were tortured in this region in the early years of Buddhism, he said. Justifying voluntary conversions, the RJD chief said that the Indian Constitution permitted voluntary change of faith and this constitutional right of the people of the country cannot be taken away.

Attributing poverty and backwardness to the abandonment of Buddha and his teachings, Yadav said that the countries which adopted and practised Buddhism were prosperous and marching ahead on the road to development. Interpreting the Buddhist slogan of ""Buddham sharnam gachhami"" in his own inimitable style, the RJD chief said that it did not mean subservience to Budhha. It meant subservience to ""budhhi"" or wisdom and knowledge. Similarly ""Sangham sharanam gacchami"" meant that unity was strength. Prosperity was inconsistent with turmoil, he said.

1,Centre sabotaging development works: CM,"SIWAN: Chief minister Rabri Devi on Sunday charged the Centre with sabotaging development works in the state.

She said that the Union government is adopting all sorts of gimmicks to defame the state government. She further said that the Centre does not want a government of â€œbackwardsâ€� to be in the saddle in Bihar.

Speaking at the Rajendra Stadium in Siwan on the occasion of the final match of the 54th S M Moinul Haq State Football Championship played between Patna and Jamshedpur on Sunday, the chief minister urged the people to establish unity and fraternity and give a befitting reply to forces who are out to disintegrate cohesion and social fabric by means of riots and other violent activities. She said that the state government has done a lot of development works for the people due to which the opposition parties have become anxious and in reaction they are trying to create an atmosphere of hatred and disunity.

The chief minister said that by not releasing funds for construction and repair of national highways, the Centre is defaming the state government. She stressed that the state government is making roads, hostels for minorities and stadiums in the district. She said that Patna, too, will soon have an international airport.

Speaking on the occasion, RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav said that the Hindutva card is being played for the sake of power. No temple, church, gurdwara or masjid is today safe in the country and the country is burning with the feeling of hatred.

He cautioned the people to be vigilant on this point and prepared to lose the independence earned after great difficulties. He said that a great responsibility lies on the Bhojpuri-speaking people to counter these onslaughts as they only represent the true picture of India. He added that sports promote unity in the country and the state government is doing everything to promote it.

Prominent among those who were present on the occasion included ministers Shivanand Tiwary, Awadh Bihari Chaudhary and Ezazul Haque and Mohd Shahabuddin, MP.

2,"RKP-SP to contest MP, Delhi polls jointly","LUCKNOW: The Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP) will contest the Madhya Pradesh and Delhi assembly elections in alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP).

The decision to this effect was taken at the party''s executive committee meeting on Sunday. Announcing this, RKP president Kalyan Singh said that he had six rounds of talks in this regard with SP president Mulayam Singh Yadav and a nationwide alliance with the SP would be formalised soon.

He, however, parried question relating to party general secretary Kusum Rai being made the party candidate for Council polls with the support of the SP. ""Talks are on with the SP for by-polls on two seats and council elections but no decision has been taken yet,"" he said giving rise to the speculation.

Former UP chief minister claimed his party was ready to be a part of the alternative government in Uttar Pradesh. ""Fall of the Mayawati government is imminent and with the Congress changing its stance, opposition parties are in a position to provide a stable alternative government in the state.""

Kalyan appeared annoyed over the media hype on BJP''s Gujarat success saying that the onward march of the saffron brigade could easily be checked if all opposition parties buried hatchets and unite on â€˜anti-BJPism''. Terming Vajpayee''s Goa musings on Hindutva as â€˜fraud'', Kalyan said that the prime minister was playing a dangerous game by redefining Hindutva. ""Hindutva is their brainchild and now new poll plank. By imposing their brand of Hindutva they are now trying to divide the nation on cultural ground,"" he alleged.

In the process, Kalyan said, Vajpayee had hatched a conspiracy to keep 78 per cent of the populace, comprising OBC/Dalit/Muslim, out of power. ""We would make this an issue to expose them in the public eyes.""

3,Saudi govt funded ad critical of Israel: Report,"NEW YORK: Saudi government funded a radio advertisement critical of Israel which ran in 15 American cities last spring.

The sponsor of advertisement criticising Israel was identified as the American Alliance for Peace and Justice which was described by its public relations firm, Qorvis, as a consortium of Middle East policy groups based in the US.

When Qorivis reported its advertisement work to the Justice Department last month, it revealed that funding for the 679,000 dollar media buy actually came from another source - Saudi government, a media report said.

The alliance was created by the firm to disguise the role of Saudis who paid it more than 200,000 dollars a month for its services, Time magazine reported quoting a ""knowledgeable source"".

In a footnote to its Justice report, the firm said Riyadh helped fund the ads with a loan to the alliance, which was later repaid by a council representing private Saudi business interests, the report said.

But the source told the magazine that most of the ""repayments"" came from businesses controlled by or close to the Saudi government and were solicited by Adel al-Jubeir, foreign policy advisor to the Crown Prince and architect of the ""Saudi public relations offensive.""

The Saudi role in financing the ads surprised Qorvis'' law firm, Patton Boggs, which also represents the Saudi Embassy.

When the ads ran, Qorvis denied Saudi government involvement to some Patton Boggs partners who protested the ads. Including the partner who quit over the flap, everyone in Patton Boggs were led to believe the Saudi government was not involved, the report said.

5,CII seeks increase in basic customs duty on capital goods,"NEW DELHI: The CII on Monday sought increase in the basic customs duty on capital goods to about 15 per cent from the present zero and five per cent saying it was causing cost disadvantages to the domestic capital goods manufacturers.

""Customs duty on capital goods currently attracting zero or five per cent basic rate should be revised to 15 per cent with CVD equal to excise duty and four per cent Special Additional Duty (SAD),"" the Chamber said in a pre-budget memorandum.

The domestic capital goods'' manufacturers are suffering inherent cost disadvantages compared to foreign suppliers on account of sales tax and other local levies on inputs/final products, higher cost of finance and infrastructure inadequacies, it said.

The sector was also facing the brunt of the slow down resulting in acute under utilisation of capacity and declining order book position, it added.

Though it showed a robust growth of 9.9 per cent during the April-November 2002, the capital goods sector still faced significant obstacles like negative protection, distorted customs duty structure, shortage of funds and reduced capital expenditure, it said.

Demanding the imposition of four per cent SAD, introduced in 1998-99 to give level playing field to the domestic industry, on imports of fertilizers, coal mining, power generation and drinking water projects, the Chamber said provision of import of more than 10-year-old industrial plants without import licence should be withdrawn.
