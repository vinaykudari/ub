0,HC dismisses plea against Delhi judicial services rules,"NEW DELHI: The high court on Monday dismissed a petition challenging certain provisions of Delhi Judicial Services (DJS) rules relating to the appointment of judicial officers in Delhi.

A Bench comprising Justice Devender Gupta and Justice B N Chaturvedi held that DJS rules are in consonance with the Constitution.

Some lawyers had challenged the DJS rules framed in 1970, describing them as unconstitutional, arbitrary and unreasonable on the grounds that it was violative of Article 234 of the Constitution as Union Public Service Commission was not consulted. But the administrative side of the high court, which was one of the respondent in the petition, contended that the provisions of the rules are in consonance with the Constitution.

Senior advocate N K Kaul and Viraj Dattar, appearing for the high court submitted that the Constitutional validity of DJS Rules, 1970, particularly with reference Article 234, was upheld by the Supreme Court and it was no longer open for the petitioners to challenge its validity.

The high court counsel said that the apex court had held that there was no rationale for enhancing the upper age limit from 32 years to 35 years under Rule 14 of the DJS Rules, 1970, but had directed the state governments to amend their judicial services rules to enable fresh law graduates to compete and enter the judicial services.

1,Left unions oppose state’s PSU policy,"KOLKATA: West Bengal industry minister Nirupam Senâ€™s effort to offload the burden of sick public sector units in view of the financial crisis met with strong opposition from Left Front partners on Sunday.

Even the CITU is opposed to any â€œblanket policy of privatisation and joint venturesâ€� in state PSUs. Senâ€™s assurance to â€œconsultâ€� trade unions before any final deal with private investors could hardly mollify them.

Front leaders would meet on Monday at the CPM state office. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would apprise them about the funds problem. Forward Bloc, CPI and RSP leaders had resented the â€œunilateral decisionâ€� to slash bonus of government employees. Senâ€™s proposal rattled them further.

Sen told trade union leaders recently that private investors would be invited to participate in 10 sick state PSUs while the state government would try to make another four worthy for financial institutions to invest. Two units were closed already.

All the 14 units will undergo â€œrestructuringâ€�, which include â€œgolden handshakeâ€� with the â€œsurplusâ€� staff. Sen offered a package of one-time payment, medical insurance and other benefits for superannuated workers. â€œPrivate funds are a must as we have no money to invest in sick units. But moves will be transparent and the worth of the companies would be decided following business optimisation study by reputed agencies. The highest bidder would be chosen through open bidding. Trade unions would be consulted before clinching the deal,â€� he assured.

â€œThe package is the best we can offer for social security of the workers who may lose their jobs. None of the central trade unions has opposed our policy and offer so far. Their silence can be considered as their support,â€� the minister claimed.

â€œIt is Senâ€™s illusion that we have supported his move. The Centre also cites the economic crisis for its privatisation bid. Why did the Left fight the Centre?â€� retorted UTUC leader Sunil Sengupta. â€œIt would send a wrong signal to the workers. Itâ€™s easy to make room for the private sector manipulators who eye factory land and other properties,â€� he said. Maintaining that most units became sick because of management failure, he asked, â€œWhat did we do for 25 years in reforming the management of these sick units?â€�

AITUC state secretary Ranajit Guha also opposed the privatisation move â€œin principleâ€� as well as winding up units before â€œsincere effortsâ€� of revival. â€œIf Sen has already decided to go for semi-privatisation of the sick units, why did he seek our opinion?â€� he remarked.

CITU state leader Kali Ghosh, too, felt that profitability should not be the sole criterion of running PSUs. â€œWe are yet to decide on Senâ€™s offer. But the government should focus on unit-specific discussion, instead of a blanket policy of privatisation or closure,â€� he said.

2,"Govt ignoring farmers, says JD-U","PATNA: State Janata Dal-U lambasted the government on Sunday for ignoring the problems being faced by farmers. At a seminar on â€œProblems of farmers and solutionsâ€�, organised under the aegis of the farmers cell of the party, party leaders said farmers were passing through a critical phase.

It was ironical that the farmers who were working hard to make the state self-sufficient in foodgrain, found themselves on the brink of starvation because of the wrong policy being pursued by the government. Presiding over the function, Mundrika Singh Yadav, president of the farmers cell, said that after experiencing ravages of flood and drought, farmers were now faced with a bleak power position, poor maintenance of tubewells and paucity of foodgrain storage facility.

Besides, hike in prices of insecticides, diesel and fertiliser had made their lives hellish. He said the poor law and order situation had further compounded the miseries of farmers, who now found themselves in a difficult situation to protect themselves and property.

The situation had come to such a sorry pass, Yadav said, that farmers were now taking recourse to suicide. JD-U MP Ramjiwan Singh said that if farmers wanted to overcome their problems, they would have to wage a long battle. Singh said that the country, where 70 per cent population resides in rural areas, could not prosper unless development of rural areas was undertaken on a priority basis.

3,Health policy for tribals demanded,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Human Rights Forum (HRF) state committee member K Balagopal demanded a comprehensive health policy to ensure good healthcare for tribals in the Vizag Agency area.

Expressing concern over the spread of malaria in the tribal belt, Balagopal told reporters here on Sunday that the government should ensure pure drinking water to all the villages as well as residential schools in the scheduled area. He said the auxiliary nurse-midwives (ANMs) were not visiting the interior villages and were offering few malaria tablets to those who complained of temperature in the villages that are close to Paderu and other mandal headquarters.

Balagopal said there was no system to diagnose the disease due to which doctors at the Primary Health Centres (PHCs) were unable to treat the patients. He said the government should supply nutritious food as the disease has been prevalent during postsummer season when tribals had less agricultural activity.

4,HIV law may face legal roadblocks,"HYDERABAD: The state governmentâ€™s move to make pre-marriage HIV tests mandatory will be next to impossible to implement as Andhra Pradesh lacks adequate testing facilities and the National Aids Control Organisationâ€™s (Naco) guidelines do not permit the same.

Further, according to legal experts, such a legislation infringes on the fundamental rights of a citizen guaranteed under the Constitution.

Even if the state government manages to get a legislation passed, Andhra Pradesh does not have adequate HIV testing facilities, as the 88 voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTCs) of the state Aids control society are only at the district level and not at mandals.

In addition, Nacoâ€™s testing policy initiatives state, in section 5.6 (1), that no one should be forced to undergo an HIV test.

â€œThe state Aids control society cannot undertake mandatory testing even at the existing centres, as Naco guidelines do not allow for the same and Naco funds cannot be used for this,â€� Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) officials said.

Naco guidelines also state that pre and post-test counselling is a must before a person undergoes an examination to find out whether he has Aids. If a person tests positive for the virus , the result must be kept confidential and should be revealed only to him or her. It can be revealed to his or her family, but only after obtaining the HIV positive personâ€™s consent.

Legal experts are of the opinion that if the legislation is enacted, it will go against Article 19 of the Constitution, which guarantees an individual the right to privacy. It will also infringe on an individualâ€™s right to livelihood, provided by Article 21.

In most personal laws of marriage, registration is not required, hence a policy for mandatory testing is impossible to implement and will not prove to be beneficial in controlling the spread of the virus, say the legal experts.

Moreover, similar initiatives around the world have failed even in countries where awareness about the virus is very high, such as the United States.

The American Civil Liberties Union report of March 1998 stated that mandatory pre-marital HIV testing was a failure after such an initiative was not accepted by any of the states.

6,J&K minister allegedly roughed up by Army,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir food minister B A Nengroo was on Monday allegedly roughed up and injured by Army personnel near the Army headquarters here, following an altercation over regulation on movement of his car, police sources said.

The minister, who is seeking re-election from his home constitueny of Pulwama, got into a heated argument with soldiers after he defied their orders to park his car in a queue and instead tried to overtake other vehicles while on way to Sinagar from his Pulwama residence, they said.

The incident occurred at Pathan Chowk, the first drop gate on the road running parrallel to the army headquarters at Badamibagh, the sources said.

Nengroo suffered injury in his mouth and nose. His son, who tried to intervene, also received some gun-butt blows.

Policemen who rushed to the scene rescued the minister and his family and took them to the hospital, the sources said.

The Indian Army is handling traffic between Sonawar and Pantha Chowk ever since militants carried out a suicide attack on their headquarters some years back. Army has errected barracades at Sonawar and Panthan Chowk and allows vehicles to pass only after thorough checking.

When contacted, a defence spokesman said the minister, who was driving the car, did not respond to a sentry''s signal to stop at the checkpoint.

As a matter of routine the sentry then stopped the minister''s car at gun point to know his identity and might have abused the minister, the spokesman said. The sentry asked the minister to follow the rules and stand in the queue, he said.

However, as soon as the minister disclosed his identity, the sentry informed higher officials. Sub-Area Commander Brig Parvinder Singh and Brig H S Sahgal reached the spot and resolved the issue ''amicably'', he added.

In a late night statement, the Army said it has ordered a court of inquiry into the incident.

7,HC releases 20 SIMI activists arrested from Surat,"AHMEDABAD: Twenty of the 123 persons arrested for being present in a convention held allegedly by the banned Students'' Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) at Surat on December 27, 2001, have been released by Gujarat High Court on a conditional bail.

Justice DP Buch ordered their release while hearing their criminal miscellaneous application moved by Akhtar Husein Gulam Husein Mansuri and 19 others. Advocates MM Shaikh, Gulamrasul Shaikh and Ratna Vora appeared for the petitioners.

Public prosecutor AD Oza submitted that the mudamal articles (exhibits), collected from the spot show that the applicants were actively involved in the activities of the said unlawful associations.

The court observed that this will again be a subject matter of the trial and the said fact can be decided on appreciation of evidence before the court.

""However, at present, it can be said that when nothing was found out from the possession of the applicants and when nothing was found out from the possession of the applicants and when their actual involvement in the activity of the aforesaid unlawful association is also prima facie, doubtful, in my opinion, this is a fit case for enlargement of the applicants on bail,"" the court observed.

The conditions laid down in the order include a solvent surety for Rs 25,000, their presence before the trial court on each and every date fixed and marking attendance at police stations twice a month till final disposal of their applications.

The applicants have also been warned not to change their addresses without prior intimation to the trial court, they have been asked not to leave the State of Gujarat without prior permission of the court, deposit their passports and co-operate the court in proceedings.

It was submitted by the applicants that following an invitation by the All India Minority Education Board, they remained present at the Rajshri Hall in Surat, alongwith others, from where they were arrested by Athwa Lines police in the early hours of December 28.

They further submitted that they were arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and that even if the allegations made in the charge-sheet are accepted as they stand, no offence is made out against them and therefore, they should be bailed. That their offence if any, was bailable.

The prosecution submitted that the applicants are charged with serious offences and therefore, they may not be enlarged on bail. The court while, interpreting the provisions of the Act, noted that there is no provision made in the said Act for treating a particular offence to be a bailable or non-bailable one.

""...we find that the applicant herein was found attending a meeting of an association which was not declared to be an unlawful association within the meaning of clause (g) of section 2 of the Act. Even if we find that he attended the said meeting, it is doubtful whether the said Act can be treated to be an Act within four corners of Sections 11, 12 and 13 of the said Act,"" it observed.

The HC further noted, ""In that view of the matter and when the antecedents of the applicants are not adverse to the applicants, it would be in the fitness of things to exercise discretionary powers and jurisdiction of the Court in favour of the applicants. Even on going through the papers, nothing more could be derived from those records. Even on going through the order of the learned Judge, Surat dated August 3, 2002, nothing further could be traced out.""

The HC pointed out that even if an offence is punishable with imprisonment for life as indicated in Section 439 of the Code, the powers of the HC and the Sessions Court are wider than the powers of a magisterial court. ""Therefore, even when an offence is punishable with imprisonment for life, the High Court is not powerless in the filed of grant of bail to the accused persons. However, the discretion has to be exercised judiciously.""

8,Shourie hits out at critics of disinvestment,"NICOSIA: Hitting back at in-house critics of disinvestment back home, Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie on Monday said the controversy over the reforms would send ""wrong signals"" to the international community and create unwarranted apprehensions among those wishing to invest in India.

Apparently referring to strong opposition from a section in his government to strategic sale of BPCL and HPCL, Shourie said the ongoing controversy has made prospective investors in India wonder whether things will stay on course.

Shourie''s remarks were made to reporters on board Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s special aircraft on its way from Delhi to Cyprus when the subject came up for discussion.

On reservations voiced by some in the Cabinet to the disinvestment, he evaded a direct response saying all decisions were taken ""collectively"".

On the strong criticism by RSS chief K Sudarshan of government''s economic policies, Shourie quipped that under the fifth amendment of the American Constitution if he is being implicatd, he need not respond to questions.

The minister said if there was a strong argument against disinvestment, it should be backed by ""hard evidence"".

Asked about Defence Minister George Fernandes suggestion that a quick decision be taken on the divestment of HPCL and BPCL and that a three-month period is a long gap, he said, ""like in editorials we say, only time tell"".

Shourie said one should remember that ""we have to woo the investors. It is not the other way around"", indicating that India may lost out to several other countries ready to take advantage of inviting such investments.

Referring to his visit to Japan where he addressed over 150 industrialists, Shourie said they had raised specific issues and pointed queries on hurdles faced by them in India as also uncertainties in their minds.

9,Dabhoi riots cast shadow on garba events in dist,"VADODARA: Riots in Dabhoi town near here on Sunday have cast a shadow on the Navratri festivities in towns across the Vadodara district and around it. The police is making elaborate arrangements for the nine-day fete in the districts that have witnessed communal tension in the last few months.

Interestingly, in the rural areas of Vadodara district Dabhoi is the only town to have a major garba event. The police has made elaborate security arrangements in the town for the event. ""There will be frisking and checking of all persons entering the venue using hand held metal detectors. The security at the venue has also been beefed up,"" said Vadodara district superintendent of police (DSP) Piyush Patel.

Patel said other venues in the district were very small and few people collected there. ""Police has been deployed at these spots to ensure security. Besides, patrolling has been stepped up in all areas where garbas have been organised. Additional forces have been deployed in all the towns where such gatherings will take place,"" he said.

In Godhra, there are sixty-eight organisers who will hold the event in various parts of the town. Of these, at least six venues will be such where more than five thousand people will gather. Officers of the Panchmahal district police said about 10 to 15 thousand people will gather at two such venues.

Panchmahal DSP Narsimha Komar said while the gathering at these venues will be large, peace is expected to prevail. In an attempt to monitor the situation, the district police has sought help of volunteers from the societies where the events will be held.

""We have asked representatives from all residential societies surrounding the venue to keep a vigil on the viewers as well as the performers. They can easily spot if there is an unknown person inside the venue and bring it to our notice,"" said Komar.

Elaborate security arrangements have also been made at the pilgrimage town of Pavagadh in the Panchmahal district. The police has set up two temporary posts at the Pavagadh village and at Maachi from where the rope-way takes pilgrims to the temple on the Pavagadh hill.

Komar said that frisking of visitors and HHMD checking will be conducted at the spot. ""A deputy superintendent of police will camp at the spot till the rush gets over. Extra buses have also been arranged for those visiting the place,"" said Komar.

In Anand also, elaborate arrangements have been made for the festivities. Anand DSP B G Waghela said that the police has asked the organisers to make necessary security arrangements. ""Besides, additional forces present in the district will be deployed during the festival,"" he said.

The police, in all the districts, have decided to stick to the 10 p.m. deadline on use of loudspeakers. In Godhra, the organisers have been asked to wind up the event at their venues by midnight even if they were not using loudspeakers.

12,Tax waiver for Navratri may put government in a spot,"MUMBAI: The state government could find itself in a legal bind for its decision to waive entertainment tax on this yearâ€™s Navratri celebrations. Pradeep Bhavnani, president of the Mumbai Youth Association, filed a contempt petition against the government on Monday for violating a Bombay high court order passed on November 24, 1998.

The order, which directs the government to tax all commercial Navratri celebrations in the state, was passed in response to a public interest litigation filed by Mr Bhavnani. The matter is likely to come up for hearing on October 10.

The government revoked its decision to levy a 50 per cent entertainment tax on Friday after hectic lobbying from Navratri organisers and criticism from both the Congress and the BJP. According to Mr Bhavnani, the government has been violating the HC order for the past three years. â€œThe Democratic Front government has been promising to levy the tax ever since it came to power, but has backed every festival season, to appease a couple of organisers,â€™â€™ he alleged.

Revenue secretary R.C. Joshi said that he was not aware of the order. â€œThe government has taken a considered decision on the issue of not levying tax,â€™â€™ he added.

13,"IDBI, IFCI secure order to attach govt properties","MUMBAI: Two major financial institutions, the IDBI and the IFCI, have secured an order from the Debt Recovery Tribunal to attach the immovable properties of the Maharashtra government after the state defaulted on loans amounting to a staggering Rs 500 crore.

The loans were given to sugar and spinning cooperatives owned or managed by leading state politicians. Both the financial institutions have invoked the counterguarantee given by the debt-ridden government for lending funds to at least 19 sugar cooperatives and spinning mills.

As the state government is said to have expressed its inability to pay up the huge amount all its immovable assets and real estate could now be attached.

The IDBI and IFCI approached the tribunal after talks between their managers and the state finance officials failed last week. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh when contacted by TNN confirmed that the state had defaulted on making payments to the two institutions. The state cabinet, he said, would be appraised of the financial situation and the implications of the tribunalâ€™s decree.

â€œThis is the first time that our guarantees have been invoked by these two firms. However, I am confident that we will make the payments to them shortly,â€™â€™ Mr Deshmukh said.

In his response, leader of the state opposition Narayan Rane said that the cash situation in the state was alarming and called for declaring a financial emergency. The DF government, he claimed, has lost its mandate to rule.

Meanwhile, the government has appointed a committee led by principal secretary (finance) A.K.D. Jadhav to negotiate the issue with the managers of the IDBI and the IFCI. Mantralaya officials said the committee would appeal to them to accept the money in small and easy instalments. The action taken by the IDBI and the IFCI, however, is a reflection on the mismanagement of public funds by the Democratic Front government, sources pointed out.

Among the prominent sugar cooperatives who have defaulted are Godavari Manar Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana manged by Bhaskar Khatgaonkar, who is the son-in-law of former chief minister Shankarrao Chavan, the Sindhakheda taluka Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana run by minister of state for labour Hemant Deshmukh and Jaikishan Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana said to be owned by minister of state for home Manikarao Thakare. The others in the list include Chopda Sahkar Karkhana in north Maharashtra and the Ambajogai Sakhar Karkhana in Marathwada among others. The state government had come under flak from the Reserve Bank of India and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India for the huge subsidies given to unbankable projects.

In the case of the cooperative spinning mills, the CAG report pointed out that out of the Rs 752.44 crore released to 116 mills between 1961 and 2001, 46 mills had not been commissioned at all while 12 have been closed. As many as 15 mills have gone under liquidation and 39 others suffered an accumulated loss of Rs 381.26 crore.

He was remanded to police custody until October 16 by the sessions court on Monday, which was to be his last day in office. The ACB raided Mr Waniâ€™s house at Marine Lines and said it had found incriminating documents. â€œI cannot elaborate on this because the matter is sub judice,â€™â€™ public prosecutor Ramnath Kini told TNN. The ACB also found assets valued at Rs 42 lakhs during the search of his house. The ACB told the court that Mr Wani (62) was one of the key conspirators in the scam. Their remand application stated that he was on the two-member examination committee along with the main accused, former vicechancellor Shashikant Karnik,who was also the former chairperson of the MPSC. With the arrest of Mr Wani, the number of those arrested in the multi-crore MPSC scam has gone up to 17.
