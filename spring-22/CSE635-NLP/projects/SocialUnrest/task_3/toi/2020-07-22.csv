0,Panja expects supporters to be inducted in party,"KOLKATA: A day after Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee revoked the suspension on rebel party MP Ajit Panja, the latter said he expected similar steps to be taken in favour of those leaders who had sided with him.

Panja particularly mentioned about Bani Sinha Roy and Kalyan Chakraborty and urged Mamata to revoke suspension on both of them.

Welcoming Mamataâ€™s decision to withdraw the suspension, Panja also said he hoped the party would now withdraw the petition submitted earlier to the Lok Sabha speaker seeking to disqualify him as an MP. Panja, who talked with Mamata over the phone on Monday evening, said the Trinamul chief had agreed to withdraw the petition at an appropriate time. â€œI canâ€™t take active part in the party unless this is done,â€� he said.

Maintaining that he was yet to receive the suspension notice, even though the party had shown him the door about two years ago, Panja said, â€œAll is well that ends well. I am happy that my oral suspension from the party made more than two years ago has been withdrawn orally.â€�

Meanwhile, the rebel Trinamul MLA Sibdas Mukherjee, suspended a month ago, managed to gain entry into the prestigious Public Accounts Committee of the state assembly, inspite of stiff resistance from the party.

The Congress ensured that Mukherjee became a member of the PAC as veteran Congress MLA Gyan Singh Sohanpal stepped out of the race in favour of the rebel Trinamul MLA, now warming up to the Congress.

â€œI had thrown a challenge that I would become a member of the PAC. I have won,â€� Mukherjee said later.

He indicated that his shift from the Trinamul to the Congress was just a beginning of a process and many more Trinamul MLAs would follow his footsteps in the future.

Kolkata mayor Subrata Mukherjee retained the post of PAC chairman. Two other Trinamul MLAs, besides Mukherjee, joined the 15 member PAC apart from one Congress candidate. The rest of the posts went to the Left Front.

1,Govt's education policy for the richest: CPI,"KANNUR: Criticising the A K Antony-led UDF ministry in Kerala for pursuing ''sloppy educational policies,'' the CPI''s state unit on Tuesday said the government has ''merely become an agent'' of privately managed educational institutions leading to unprecedented crisis in higher education sector.

""Thanks to the wrong education policies, higher education has almost become a monopoly of the richest with government agreeing to bring uniformity in the enhanced fee structure for professional courses,"" CPI national executive member P K Vasudevan Nair told a press conference here.

Government had on Monday announced issuing no objection certificates (NOC) to as many as 680 private educational institutions thereby allowing them to have free hand in deciding own fee structure.

""If government is committed to ensure its promises on 50 per cent quota on merit, it can follow Karnataka''s example, which had ensured 75 per cent seat on merit, and formulate its own norms by refusing to issue NOCs to institutions which do not fall in line with the government''s criteria till the supreme court pronounced its verdict in this regard,"" he said.

Describing UDF ministry''s two-year performance as ''total flop'', the former chief minister alleged government had failed to initiate various developmental projects and dashed the hopes of people who voted the front back to power with ''brute majority.''

B.Ed institutions recognised by NCTE can only be affiliated

Kochi,Jul 22 (PTI) A Division Bench of the Kerala high court today held that only those B.Ed institutions, which have been recognised by the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE), can be affiliated by Universities in Kerala from the next academic year onwards.

Only after fulfilling the conditions put forward by the NCTE and after getting its recognition, B.Ed institutions can be recognised by the universities, the bench, comprising Justice J B Koshy and Justice K Thankappan, held while disposing of petitions by the Kerala Unaided Training college management Association and others.

The petitioners pointed at the lack of infrastructure at the B.ed centres run by the unversities directly. These centres do not have the required infrastructure facilities like libraries and laboratories as required by NCTE norms.

In Kerala, there are about 35 B.Ed centres being run by four universities in the state which do not have the facilities, the petitioners stated.

2,"UDF crisis, a political drama by Cong: BJP","KOZHIKODE: BJP''s Kerala Unit on Tuesday termed the recent crisis in the ruling UDF in the backdrop of Chief Minister A K Antony''s remarks on minorities, as a ''political drama'' enacted by the Congress high command during its Shimla conclave ""to escape the wrath of minorities"" in the state.

""The entire episode, involving Congress and IUML, major partners in the UDF, was enacted by the AICC at Shimla and the Antony Government should therefore resign and seek a fresh mandate,"" BJP State President-elect and party''s National Executive member, P S Sreedharan Pillai, told reporters here.

Although the contents of Antony''s remarks were ''absolutely true'' as minorities were reportedly enjoying more benefits in the state, he said having made the statement, the Chief Minister should now try to correct the majority-minority equations in the state or quit office and seek a fresh mandate from the people.

Both Antony and KPCC President, K Muraleedharan, were directed by their party high command to express counter views after the former made the controversial statement against minorities, Pillai alleged and said the post of KPCC President had become more or less irrelevant and that Muraleedharan had ''no say'' with the high command.

Asked if Congress high command had not succeeded in its ''drama'' to defuse the crisis in the UDF, he said it had only helped people realise that they had been taken for a ride by the major partners of UDF.

4,Stray incidents mar bandh in Jharkhand,"RANCHI: Barring some stray incidents, the initial 12 hours of the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC)-sponsored two-day Jharkhand bandh passed off peacefully on Tuesday.

The bandh has been called to protest against the June 16 capital punishment awarded to three MCC activists by Hazaribag additional district and sessions judge Ashok K Chand in connection with Beltu massacre in 2001, in which 14 people were killed.

At the time of going to Press, an encounter was going on between the police and MCC extremists at Baruhathu in Ranchi district.

One CRPF jawan has reportedly been injured in the encounter. No further details were available. In another incident, there was a blast near Thapar Halt when Hazaribag SP Anurag Gupta was going in his vehicle. It was not known whether it was a case of bomb blast or landmine blast.

There was no report of any injury till the last reports came in.

As the railways have been a major target of the extremists during pre-vious bandhs, precaution was taken to divert at least three trains, namely the Delhi-bound Jharkhand Swarnjayanti Express, Jammu Tawi Express and the Varanasi Express.

These trains were run through the Grand Chord line. Passenger trains on the Barkakana section were cancelled as a precautionary measure.

Additional forces comprising the CRPF, RAF, JAP and RPF have been deployed to deal with the situation.

6,SFI protests against college fee hike,"PUNE: The Studentsâ€™ Federation of India (SFI) on Tuesday staged â€˜dharnasâ€™ in six city educational institutes in protest against the commercialisation of higher education.

The protestors later gathered in front of the district collectorate office and shouted slogans, demanding that the state government exercise total control over all private engineering and medical colleges in Maharashtra.

While the call to students to boycott classes received a mixed response in the city, the federation members said the students were apprised of the impending situation arising out of the commercialisation of higher education.

According to SFI state secretary Maharudra Dake, Tuesdayâ€™s agitation was part of a state-wide programme. â€œThe idea is to create awareness about the impending situation in pursuing higher education amongst the student community and involve them to oppose any such move,â€� he said.

The colleges where the SFI members staged their agitation are: Abasaheb Garware College, Fergusson College, SP College, Apasaheb Jedhe College, Tilak and Astanga Ayurvedic Mahavidyalayas.

Disclaiming the rationale of private educational institutions that they can fix their own fee structure in the wake of a supreme court order, Dake said private colleges have taken some kind of favour â€” be it land or some other support â€” from the government. â€œUnder these circumstances, they cannot be termed as unaided colleges,â€� Dake said.

Dake pointed out to the All-India Council for Technical Education directive issued earlier this year that any college that gets some kind of assistance from the government does not qualify to be called an unaided institution.

â€œIf the government can exercise control over these private colleges, there is no question for the latter not adhering to the government regulated fee structure,â€� he explained.

7,Officials hurt during Biharsharif bandh,"BIHARSHARIF: The Nalanda Civic Development Manch-sponsored â€œBiharsharif bandhâ€� on Tuesday turned violent with a number of people, including Nalanda SP Amit Lodha, local BDO Fateh Faiaz Ahmad and some policemen, receiving serious injuries in the clash between the police and the agitators demanding adequate supply of power and drinking water to the town.

The clash took place when a procession of more than 40,000 agitating people forcibly entered the premises of the local super grid station of Powergrid Corporation by breaking open its gate which was being guarded by policemen. The policemen, in retaliation, made lathicharge, used tear-gas and fired 50 rounds in the air. Provoked by the police firing, the mob resorted to brickbatting in which Lodha, Ahmad and some policemen received serious injuries. Many others were also injured in the police lathicharge.

The Manch had given the call for â€œtotal Biharsharif bandhâ€� in protest against the inadequate supply of power and drinking water to the town. Biharsharif town wore a deserted look on Tuesday as traders kept their shops closed. No vehicle plied on the road. Even the Rajgir-bound Shramjeevi Express was forced to stop near the Pawapuri halt railway crossing for about four hours. People from all walks of life, including doctors, engineers, college teachers, businessmen and students, joined the procession.

As the procession moved, the irate agitators damaged several government vehicles, including that of the local circle inspector. On getting the information, Lodha and DM Hukum Singh Meena reached the trouble spot. The agitators threw brickbats at Lodhaâ€™s vehicle.

The situation eased to some extend when Meena said that the Biharsharif zonal chief engineer of the BSEB had sent a fax message to him assuring that Biharsharif town would be getting 14 MW of power for the present and that the supply would be enhanced to 25 MW after the installation of a 20 KVA transformer at the local Bari Pahari station.

Manch president Arvind Kumar Sinha and its organiser Ranjeet Prasad Singh said the people of Biharsharif showed exemplary unity during the bandh. The lawyers of the town also abstained from their professional work as a result of which court work remained paralysed for the whole day. The banks, LIC office and other government offices remained closed. Even government employees observed the bandh which evoked an unprecedented response here.

Organisations representing different trades and professions took part in the bandh.

8,SPM postpones decision to increase fees,"PUNE: The final decision on the contentious fee hike issue, which has got the Shikshana Prasaraka Mandaliâ€™s (SPM) English school in bind (TOI, July 19), has been postponed by a month.

This was announced by Sunil Radkar, vice-president, SPM management council, following a three-and-a-halfhour-long meeting with parents here on Tuesday.

The meeting, held on SPM campus in Navi Peth, began amidst heavy police presence. The SPM council, in a formal letter addressed to the parents, defended the fee hike.

The council said the school was unaided and had to depend entirely on student fees. Highlighting the salient features of the school, the council said the school had restricted the number of students per class to ensure individual attention.

Council members also stated that the teachers were being paid as per the fifth pay commission, which was putting an additional burden on the school management.

The council said that the 997 students in the school had 51 teachers and 20 non-teaching staff to look after them. This figure was higher than in other schools, the council stated.

The council members said that if the fees were not hiked, they would have to increase the number of students per class and reduce the number of teachers, both of which was not advisable. The council stated that despite the fee hikes in recent years, the school administration had continued to incur losses since 2001.

According to the panel, despite the fee hike between Rs 1,700 and Rs 2,800, the school would still incur losses to the tune of Rs 28,850 for the primary section and Rs 4,59,750 for the secondary section.

Some 25 parents spoke at the meeting, many of whom criticised the council for not issuing receipts for donations. Others wanted to know how the donations were being utilised.

â€œWe are not sure whether our funds are being actually used to provide facilities to the students,â€� one parent said.

Abhay Dadhe, SPM council member, told TNN that the parents had been asked to form a committee of about 10 members to discuss the fee hike in detail with the council.

9,"AIPJD, Cong may sweep statutory body elections","HUBLI: The All India Progressive Janata Dal (AIPJD) candidates, with help from Congress, are tipped to make a clean sweep in the election for the chairmanâ€™s posts in the standing committees to the the Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation to be held on Wednesday.As per the understanding reached between the two parties during mayoral elections, the key finance and health committees will go to AIPJD while Congress wants support from Dal members for the chairmanâ€™s posts in the other two committees.

The partywise strength in the four standing committees are as follows:

a) Finance: AIPJD 3, Congress 2, BJP 2; b) Health: Congress 3, AIPJD 2, BJP, 2; c) Accounts: Congress 3, AIPJD 2, BJP 2; d) Planning and Works Committee: Congress 3, AIPJD 2, BJP 2.

The Finance Committee chairmanâ€™s post which is considered more powerful than the mayorâ€™s post is fiercely contested between two committee members J.D. Shamida Killedar and Shivu Hirekerur.

However, elections for the chairmanâ€™s post is more a prestige issue and not contested purely on party lines. As voting is held in secret ballot, differences between Congress and JD members over choice of the chairmen may benefit BJP which has two members each in the standing committees.

Among other names doing the rounds for the chairmanâ€™s post are Burnabus, Health Committee, Planning and Works Durgappa Bijewad. Senior BJP corporator Ranga Baddi said his party would work out a strategy only on Wednesday.

Congress candidate Anil Kumar Patil was elected for the mayorâ€™s post with conditional support from AIPJD in June. The Congress supported by AIPJD and independents has a strength of 48 members as against BJP with only 24.

10,Parties warm up for assembly polls,"HUBLI: Although the Assembly elections are due October next, the mainstream political parties in the region have begun their warm-up drill.

The parties â€” the Congress, BJP and the divided Janata Parivar â€”are making all efforts to woo the people. Among the other parties trying to make a mark is the â€˜Kannada Partyâ€™, launched by Dharwad North MP Vijay Sankeshwar.

All major parties have witnessed some erosion of base for various reasons in the undivided Dharwad district comprising Dharwad, Haveri and Gadag. The Congress suffered an erosion because it could not fulfill the aspirations and needs of farmers of the region.

The BJP and Janata Parivar have shed their political weight due to internal dissensions and failure to work as effective and responsible opposition parties.

Kannada Nadu party is in search of its moorings since its head, Sankeshwar, has failed to attract any noteworthy leaders since he quit the BJP.

In the wake of these developments, the political observers claim neither the BJP, Congress, nor the disgruntled Janata Parivar, are sure of getting the peopleâ€™s support to enhance their chances of winning.

They are simply keen on winning more Assembly seats than in 1996. In the absence of a good track record, they have started targeting S.M. Krishna and his party, blaming for ills afflicting North Karnataka.

While the Janata Parivar leaders have been ridiculing the Congress and BJP at the state and national level, the Congress leaders, on the other hand, believe that â€˜Krishna-bashingâ€™ will not help the parties regain lost ground.

At the party and individual levels, the All India Progressive Janata Dal led by former chief minister S.R. Bommai and his son Basavaraj Bommai have been making efforts to win over farmers by holding mass meetings and padayatras.

Congress and BJP know that as long as the Janata Parivar is engaged in infighting, it cannot make a dent on them.

However, the campaign launched by these three parties has provided people, particularly farmers, a chance to divert their attention from Congress. And, the Kannada Nadu party has been nourishing only one ambition â€” that of securing a few seats to keep their stakes alive.

However, for majority of the people, these political development appears to be insignificant. When will farmers woes end in North Karnataka seems to be of greater interest to them than which party will form government after the Assembly election.

11,Survey blames pollen grains for ailments,"KOLKATA: If you have a running nose or a nasty cough from May to September, think twice before blaming the weather. The cause of your ailment could well be a tree in your neighbourhood.

A survey conducted by the Centre for Study of Man and Environment has identified about 75 types of pollen in Kolkata and Salt Lake which can harm human beings. Local environmental biologist Sunirmal Chanda, who headed the survey, says some common trees and plants like chhatim, neem or papaya spread harmful pollen grains.

Chanda says a global survey has estimated that 15 per cent of the people suffer from respiratory allergy due to pollen grains. In Kolkata, the percentage is higher due to a polluted environment.

According to Chanda, pollen grains from flowers of trees and weeds enter the human body and adversely affect people who are allergic to these. â€œOne needs a proper allergy test and quick medication. Delay and repeated exposures make them almost incurable,â€� he says.

Chanda, who is associated with the Bose Institute and is a visiting professor to several foreign universities, has spearheaded a project to draw up pollen calendars to identify dispersed airborne pollen grains in various bio-zones in India.

Chanda says an expert committee set up by Calcutta High Court in 2000 had asked the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to devise a strategy for controlling the biological air pollution. But nothing has been done so far.

According to Chanda, respiratory allergy is induced by pollen when it makes contact with the upper respiratory tract, the nose, oral cavity and the eyes. Pollen grains have the potential to cause asthma, naso-bronchial allergy, allergic rhinitis and a host of eye, skin and chest problems.

Significantly, government agencies like the forestry department and Kolkata Municipal Corporation are unaware of the harmful effects of pollen grains. As a result, trees and plants like chhatim, betelnut, neem, palm, papaya and coconut, which can spread harmful pollen grains, are still planted across the state.

â€¢Most common during May, August, September

â€¢Skin prick tests shows pollen of grasses were most potent.

â€¢Following clinical application of pollen extracts of 22 species of higher plants on 2,224 patients at the allergy unit of Institute of Child Health, Kolkata, 1,282 (57.64 per cent) males and 942 (42.36 per cent) females tested positive.

12,Ex-BJP corporator blames AMC for riots,"AHMEDABAD: The depositions before the Nanavati-Shah commission took a new twist on Tuesday with an ex-BJP corporator stating that some employees of the Congress-run Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) were involved in the post-Godhra riots in the city.

The former corporator, Kamal Balwantrao Kamalkar, who is an advocate and a member of the local peace committee, claimed that he had witnessed a few persons alighting from a jeep bearing the AMC tag and attacked Pratap Tendulkar who later succumbed to his injuries.

Kamalkar represented the Dudheshwar municipal ward till 2000 when the Congress won the AMC elections.

He recalled that the incident happened on February 28 last year. Two groups had confronted each other around 2 pm near the Shahpur locality where the majority of the residents are Muslims. Interestingly, Kamalkar also praised the police action and said that police inspector G C Rawat of the Madhavpura police station should not have been transferred.

Despite around 100 cases of rioting being registered with the police under the Madhavpura jurisdiction here as a fallout of the Godhra carnage, witnesses deposing before the commission on Tuesday claimed that peace had prevailed in their respective areas.

On persistent quizzing by advocate Shabana Mansuri during the cross-examination, the witnesses maintained that rioting might have occurred, but the particular locality where they resided were devoid of any violent incidents.

13,Worried Modi calls for capping farmers' dissent,"GANDHINAGAR: Perturbed over farmers'' agitation against power tariff hike gathering momentum with support of the Congress, Chief Minister Narendra Modi has directed minister of state for energy Saurabh Patel to work out an action plan to convince the farmers about the compulsions of the government to hike the tariff by 2.5 times.

He has simultaneously directed state BJP chief Rajendrasinh Rana to ""discipline"" those party MLAs and leaders who are expressing open or covert opposition to the agitation.

As a direct sequel, on Tuesday, Patel held a high-level meeting with chief secretary P K Laheri, state information secretary Pankaj Kumar and other bureaucrats to come up with road-side posters, leaflets, booklets and advertisement campaign, particularly in the electronics media and radio, on the need for power sector reforms. The Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) has begun distributing handbills enumerating 13 different points suggesting that the power tariff hike does not harm the farmers.

The campaign will highlight that the decision to raise the minimum tariff for the farmers to 50 paise per unit was first taken under the Congress rule when P V Narasimha Rao was prime minister in 1991. ""He held an all-CMs'' meeting where Gujarat''s Chimanbhai Patel attended and agreed with the decision,"" it was stated. After the hike, Gujarat''s tariff came to 46 paise per unit.

In 1996, when H D Deve Gowda was the prime minister, the power reforms took off, with then state energy minister Vipul Chaudhary, a protâ€šgâ€š of Shankersinh Vaghela, putting in his signature of approval at a meeting in the Centre.

""The result was, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa took steps towards reforms,"" the participating official said. ""Gujarat could not do that on account of the quake and drought conditions,"" he explained.

Officials suggested, one should highlight the fact that Gujarat''s tariff at Rs 1,260 per HP per year were still lower than Rs 1,448 in Madhya Pradesh and Rs 2,224 in Rajasthan, though somewhat higher than Maharashtra''s Rs 1,000.

The campaign''s main theme would be to ask the state Congress why it was opposing reforms in Gujarat when the states ruled by it favoured reforms. Besides, the GEB handbill, underlines that in 10 years the tariff hike for sections other than farmers had gone up much higher - 4.8 times for domestic consumers, 6.6 times for the commercial users and 4.5 times for the industries.

Also, the per unit power cost to the GEB, which stood at Rs 1.63 paise per unit in 1994-95, has reached Rs 3.59 today. Yet, for 10 years, the per unit power rate for farmers remained a low 18 paise. This despite the fact that most of power in Gujarat is produced by using coal brought from 1,700 km away.

19,J&K govt takes over SKIMS hospital,"SRINAGAR: In a swift move to prevent enormous loss to the state and to protect the interests of lakhs of patients, Jammu and Kashmir Government on Wednesday took over the control of the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura along with all institutions affiliated with it.

Announcing the decision of the government, an official spokesman said that the government has also taken over the possession and management of Kashmir Nursing Home located in the posh area of Gupkar Road, Srinagar to prevent illegal transfer of possession of this precious asset to a third party by the Sher-I-Kashmir National Medical Institute Trust. The third party was reportedly inaugurating the Nursing Home on Wednesday. The premises have been sealed by the District Magistrate, Srinagar in the wee hours on Wednesday.

The government has also revoked its order No: 214-ME of 1976 dated 27-8-1976 under which the government had transferred the Kashmir Nursing Home along with its land building and annexe, previously occupied by Fisheries Department and all other assets including equipment to Sher-i-Kashmir Medical Institute Trust exclusively for maintaining a nursing home.

It also revoked another Government Order No: Rev(NDK) 90 of 1978 dated 19-04-1978 where under land measuring 292 kanals 8 marlas situated at Zoonimar, Srinagar, Government Dispensary at Soura, Drug Research Lab along with land measuring 7 kanals and 12 marlas were transferred to the trust. The Kashmir Nursing Home along with land measuring 5 marlas and other assets belonging to the Health Department were also transferred to the trust.

This was done under Transfer of Property Act but no transfer deed or lease deed was executed between the State Government and the Trust to effectuate the purported transfer. In 1995-96, the trust had approached the government to take over the Nursing Home as it was unable to run it in view of financial difficulties. A decision was also taken by the then chief minister to take over but later the government provided Rs. 50 lakh as financial assistance for its expansion.

The record reveals that the then Law Secretary had opined that the transfer of the government land by simple government order without indicating whether it is on lease and also with no mention of duration of lease is void ab initio and advised to rescind the government orders.

Meanwhile, Director, Madr-e-Meharban Institute of Health Sciences, Jammu on 18-5-2003 approached the Health Department for permission to open its branch at Srinagar revealing that the trust had in principle agreed to lease out the premises of Kashmir Nursing Home to it for the purpose. It clearly indicated that the Trust was clandestinely looking for the third party to take over Kashmir Nursing Home which is closed since 1995. To cap it, the Nursing Home was purported to be inaugurated on Wednesday and in the eventuality it would have created third party interest illegally and dissipation of the government property despite government''s notice and warning in this regard.

The facts are that the Nursing Home including land is legally the property of the government transferred to the Trust for running a nursing home. Its subsequent lease to any private party is violative of the objectives of transfer. Accordingly the government in the public interest and to protect its property decided to take over the Nursing Home and run it as a government hospital/nursing home.

The purported transfer of land at Soura vide Government Order of 19-4-1978 is also without legal authority and in total disregard of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act. The government had also received numerous complaints about the running of management schemes. Public rallies have regularly been held by employees of SKIMS demanding removal of the control of the Trust being run as a private institution rather than a public institution.

Since the entire institution of SKIMS was made with state land and government funds and the government bearing full financial burden of its upkeep, plan and non-plan expenses, the government took over the SKIMS to manage its affairs more professionally, efficiently and in the best public interest.

The government had also taken over legal possession of the property situated at Kothi Bagh, Srinagar popularly known as Ali Jan Shopping Complex over which the State has lawful title and claims as real owner thereof vis-Ã -vis those who have raised construction thereon and are in physical possession. Even in this case the Trust has transferred property to third parties to construct accommodation for commercial purposes in total breach of the purpose for which the property was handed over the Trust.

The Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar has been asked to inform the occupants of properties in the shopping complex to present document, title deed of the property in their possession and to disclose premium, rent or any licence fee paid or payable to the Trust or any other persons. The possessors have been directed to deal directly with the state government in the health and medical education with regard to their property in their possession.

21,Civic body in clash cauldron,"KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation saw yet another fracas which resulted in its chairman Anil Mukherjee being admitted to a city nursing home on Wednesday.

The 78-year-old chairman ill when he was reportedly hit in the chest and chin during a clash between Trinamul Congress and CPM councillors at the civic body monthly meeting. Mukherjee was trapped between two clashing groups.

KMC doctors advised the authorities to take him to the hospital when he complained of chest pain. Nursing home sources said in the evening that though Mukherjeeâ€™s condition was â€œnot so seriousâ€�, he would be kept under observation for 72 hours. This was the second time that the Mukherjee fell ill during the monthly meeting due to clash between the councillors.

Mayor Subrata Mukherjee condemned the â€œattackâ€� on the chairman terming it as a barbaric act. Mukherjee said that he would take up the matter with the state government and would demand the appointment of a marshal for security of the chairman.

The trouble started when the CPM councillors prevented the chairman from entering the council chamber to start the monthly session.

The Left Front councillors were protesting against the chairmanâ€™s decision to reject the oppositionâ€™s demand for accepting the KMC fiasco for discussion in the monthly meeting.

The Left Front had brought an adjournment on June 25 motion seeking an explanation from the mayor what exactly had happened between municipal commissioner Debasis Som and the seven rebel mayor-in-council members.

The motion was rejected and a subsequent appeal to hold a special session for discussion of the issue was also not accepted.

An irate opposition leader Nirmal Mukherjee instructed the Left Front councillors to prevent the chairman from running the KMC House.

However, an adamant chairman made it clear that he would not succumb to pressure. Clashes broke out when the Trinamul Congress escorted the chairman to his post. Trinamul and CPM councillors came to blows and Mukherjee was trapped in between.

Trinamul Congress councillor Arup Biswas was injured when he fell and others stumbled upon him. Councillor Ratan De alleged that his wrist watch was stolen. However, the CPM councillor Pravakar Mondal alleged that Chhotu Chowdhury, his colleague, was beaten with a shoe by a Trinamul councillor.

The opposition leader said that a no confidence motion would be brought against the chairman for violating all democratic norms. The opposition leader alleged that the chairman was guided by the Trinamul party high command and not by KMC constitution.
