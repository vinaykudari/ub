0,National income set for big jump,"NEW DELHI: The Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) expected the net national product, known as national income, to rise by 8.4 per cent in 2003-04 against the growth of 3.5 per cent last year.

Income per head of the country''s more than one billion people is set to reach Rs 20,860 at current prices from last year''s Rs 18,912, showing a rise of 10.3 per cent. At 1993-94 prices, the per capita income would reach Rs 11,684 against last year''s Rs 10,964.

The statistics confirm what has been visible in the country''s busy cities, populated towns and even the villages. India''s middle class is growing. Higher incomes are spurring a consumption boom, palpable not only in glitzy malls but also in bazars and haats.

There is a growth of 35 per cent in telephone connections, 31.4 per cent in production of commercial vehicles, 7.5 per cent in cargo handled at ports and 3.7 per cent in rail passenger traffic.

Inevitably, there are some laggards. Growth in mining and quarrying is estimated to have slowed down to four per cent compared to 8.8 per cent in 2002-03. The construction sector witnessed 6 per cent growth this fiscal against 7.3 per cent last year.

3,Evict govt flat encroachers in a week: HC,"PATNA: A division bench of the Patna High Court, comprising Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice R S Garg, directed the state government on Monday to get all government quarters occupied by unauthorised occupants vacated within a week.

When he said that he had already initiated the process of allotment of such quarters to government officials, the bench observed, â€œVacate the quarters from their unauthorised occupants first before initiating the allotment process. How can you allot a quarter unless it is vacated by the unauthorised occupant?â€�

4,Munde castigates party’s city unit,"PUNE: BJP state unit chief Gopinath Munde on Sunday said that he would tour western Maharashtra from February 16 in the run-up to the forthcoming general elections. Munde said he had thus accepted state home minister R.R. Patilâ€™s recent challenge that NCP workers would not allow any BJP leader to ""set foot"" in the region because the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre had ""failed to release adequate drought funds"" to Maharashtra.

Addressing a rally of BJP workers here, ostensibly to announce new party officebearers, Munde dared the Democratic Front government in the state to dissolve the state assembly. ""Last time, we sent Sharad Pawar packing, and it would not take much to do the same to Patil,"" he said.

Commenting on Pune, Munde said that if the saffron alliance came to power, he would release enough funds to solve all the problems facing the city, including its traffic woes. He also expressed concern over the cityâ€™s increasing crime rate. Munde, in his one-and-ahalf-hour speech, also touched upon the increasing infighting in the BJP city unit. ""This is not BJP culture,"" he told the rally.

""I see that individuals are considered more important than the party,"" he remarked. Commenting on the partyâ€™s failure to elect ward-wise committees, Munde warned that those who tried to gain political mileage out of these elections would be removed from the party.

He directed party officials to ensure that all the ward committees were in place a month before the general elections.

5,"5,500 chicks perish in poultry farm fire","CHANDIGARH: In a major fire incident, about 5,500 ten-day old chicks were burnt at Walia Poultry Farm, on Jyanti Road, Khuda Lahora, on Monday.

The fire broke out in one of the four sheds of the farm and it took about two hours for fire tenders to extinguish it. Fire tenders from stations in sectors 17, 38 and 11 were rushed to the spot. Though the cause of the fire could not be ascertained, but short circuit in the convector being used to provide heat to the birds was suspected to have initiated a spark.

Charred bodies of chicks and feathers were strewn all over the place. Birds in the other three sheds were terrified and shrieking at the highest pitch.

The loss was estimated at Rs 3.5 lakh.

Owner of the poultry farm Inderjeet Singh said, â€˜â€˜I had bought these birds ten days back. I was in my shop in Chandigarh when I got information about the fire. When I reached there, my birds had already turned into ashes.â€™â€™

Inderjeet said that saw dust was burnt in the â€˜bukhariesâ€™ to keep the sheds warm. â€˜â€˜As the wind was blowing at very a fast speed, the â€˜bukhariesâ€™ could have caused the fire,â€™â€™ said Inderjeet.

7,Poultry farmers campaign against growing fear for bird flu,"PUNE: In a bid trap the widespread inhibition of bird flu and the need to revive the sale of chicken and eggs in the city, hundreds of poultry players â€” chicken vendors, poultry farmers and egg distributors from the Maharashtra Broiler Farmers Association lead a morcha and submitted a memorandum to the District Collectorate on Tuesday.

MBFA secretary R. Shewale said there was a nose-dive drop in the sale of chicken, eggs and chicken products all across the city. â€œIt''s high time we bring about awareness and educate people that India has nothing to fear about the bird flu,â€� Shewale said.

It may be mentioned here that the sale and consumption of chicken accounts to nearly 70 per cent vis-Ã -vis to meat all across the country.

Senior members from MBFA said the main agenda of the memo was revival of their trade and the immediate need to thwart the widespread panic of bird flu. â€œNot a single case of bird flu has been reported in the country. However, the media is whipping up the whole issue and simply spreading a fear wave amongst the general public,â€� said SK Shaikh, a MBFA member.

Chicken and egg vendors from the Shivaji Market Machi Ani Khatik Vyavasaya Sanghtna (SMMAKVS), too had participated in the morcha.

Some vendors said earlier they slaughtered nearly 5,000 chicken. â€œHowever, after the â€œbird fluâ€� uproar, the sales have dipped by nearly 40 per cent,â€� said a SMMAKVS member.

S M Desai, a distressed chicken vendor said a majority of the chicken vendors are caught in a Catch 22 situation. â€œWith dipping sales and rising chicken feed rates, it is becoming an uphill task to make both ends meet,â€� Desai lamented.

On an average each chicken weighs approximately two kg and is sold anywhere between Rs 58 to Rs 80. However, of late very few people are opting for eggs and chicken products.

Yusuf Memon, a chicken vendor from Kondhwa said, â€œUnlike beef and mutton, fresh chicken tends to decay faster. Given at

the rate things are moving, our entire stock of chicken will perish in the next few weeks,â€� Memon rued.

10,SC questions Delhi government on power crisis,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court which recently wondered as to why Delhiites had to suffer darkness when the economy was booming, on Tuesday again expressed displeasure over Sheila Dikshit government''s laxity in curbing menace of power theft in the Capital.

Despite court''s repeated reminders to the state government to curb large scale power theft which was making power supply situation worse every day, government''s counsel Wasim Ahmad Qadri said that the process for establishment of special courts was started.

As a Bench of Justices Ruma Pal and P V Reddi granted one week time to Quadri to inform it about the steps taken to improve the situation, the power distributors and the government had said that surplus power was available but due to loss of over 50 per cent of total generated electricity through theft, there had been frequent load sheddings.

Quadri said the inspectors to be appointed under the Delhi Electricity Act could inspect and search for theft of electricity and were empowered to impose penalty while compounding the offence.

On counsel Ranjit Kumar''s application highlighting power crisis in the national capital, the apex court had issued notices to the government and private power distributing companies.

Kumar, who is assisting the court various public interest matters, has sought use of solar energy as alternative source of power.

He said though the Capital requires on an average 2600 to 2700 MW of power every day, the total production of power by DVB was a meagre 350 MW the rest being supplied by NTPC.

""There is a colossal pilferage and theft of power in the city amounting to almost 1000 MW and the corrupt employees of the Board were hand-in-glove with the defaulters,"" he had alleged.
