0,'Healing touch policy bearing fruit in J&K',"PUNE: Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed on Tuesday claimed that militants in the Valley were getting desperate as their base has been destroyed due to the state governmentâ€™s â€˜healing touchâ€™ policy, coupled with good governance.

Speaking to reporters during his brief visit to the city, Sayeed said the success of the â€˜healing touchâ€™ campaign has worried militants and they were trying to derail the peace process.

â€œThere is desperation among the militants, but desperation cannot be sustained as long as we sustain the peopleâ€™s goodwill,â€� he said. The militants have completely gone on the defensive, the chief minister said, adding that the peace process would not stop.

The government will ensure good governance, effective administration and development, he said. Sayeed said the Afghan and Iraq wars have had a positive psychological impact on the situation in the Valley and he was confident that the fresh peace initiative by Prime Minister A B Vajpayee will bring a positive outcome.

Answering a question on power availability for industries in J&K, Sayeed said the Doda power project, which was abandoned due to militancy, will be revived and commissioned by the National Hydel Power Corporation by March 2004.

â€œWe are also looking at micro hydel power projects and have completed feasibility reports for 26 micro projects, each having the capacity to generate three to six MW,â€� the chief minister said, adding that around 240 MW will become available through these projects.

Tenders will be floated for private participation. Sayeed stated that a 900 MW project will be completed near Jammu on river Chinab by 2005.

Meanwhile, responding to Sayeedâ€™s invitation, around 100 corporators of the Pune Municipal Corporation have decided to visit the Valley.

Municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar has approved the visit and said the trip will be funded by each corporator.

1,State plans farmers' bazaars,"PUNE: The state government will set up 400 farmersâ€™ bazaars across the state in the next two years and a 100-acre market terminal at Thane to eliminate middlemen and facilitate direct marketing of agricultural produce.

State minister for marketing and employment guarantee scheme, Harshavardhan Patil, made the announcement at a press conference here on Tuesday. He was speaking after officially inaugurating a mango outlet in the city, which assures farm price.

A joint collaboration of the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB) and Mahamango, the outlet, which opened on April 16, has sold alphonso mangoes worth Rs 5 lakh till date. Patil said that government has already set up 42 farmer bazaars in the state where the farmers directly sell their produce.

â€œThere is no cess, no commission agent or middleman. All the earnings go to the farmer,â€� the minister said. Each bazaar costs about Rs 25 lakh to build, of which Rs 10 lakh each come from the agriculture produce market committee and farmers, while Rs 5 lakh is given as grant by the department of agriculture.

About the Thane terminal, the minister said the government has been approached for 100-acre land near Thane for the Rs 150 crore market. The project report has been compiled by the Cibaca company and global tenders are to be floated for the actual construction.

â€œThe farmers will be able to bring their produce for grading, packaging, processing and selling at this market,â€� he added. Earlier, addressing the gathering at the Mahamango outlet, Patil said the MSAMB and the marketing department will have to shoulder greater responsibility.

â€œWe have encouraged horticulture on 20 lakh hectare of land, set up 1.48 lakh co-operative societies of farmers and provided for working capital worth Rs 78,000 crore, but hitherto we did not pay due attention to the marketing aspect,â€� he observed.

According to the minister, every year, state farmers produce Rs 40,000 crore worth of processed agri products and marketing officials will have to be appointed even at the taluka level to ensure a good price.

â€œThis year, we have set an export target of 50 lakh metric tonnes and will offer an export subsidy of Rs 10,000 per container,â€� he revealed. Patil added that Indian agri produce like mangoes, pomegranates, orange and sweet limes are in great demand in foreign markets but Indian growers will have to pay special attention to grading and packaging.

Speaking at the function, Ram Kharche, executive director, MSAMB, said that after alphonso mangoes, the Gultekdi outlet will sell the kesar mangoes, oranges, pomegranates, grapes, raisins and cashew.

â€œThe price will be 15 to 20 per cent less than the market price,â€� he explained. Shivajirao Deshmukh, state secretary for co-operation said that the government was worried about the widening gap between the farmers and consumers.

He asked district agriculture produce market committees to review the existing marketing system which involved middlemen and called for open and transparent transactions in the market committee.

Ratnakar Gaikwad, commissioner for co-operation, said that urban credit societies have adopted 600 multiple service societies under the business development programme to facilitate the sale of agri produce without middlemen.

â€œWe plan to adopt another 2,000 societies during the current fiscal,â€� he revealed. Patilâ€™s deputy Madan Pisal also spoke on the occasion.

2,Firodia calls for labour law reforms,"PUNE: Expressing grave concern about the holistic development of the country, citybased industrialist Arun Firodia said there is a dire need for India to make its labour laws more flexible and focus on foreign exports to make a niche for itself in the world.

Firodia was speaking on â€˜Who will be the winner? China or India? Dictatorship or democracy?â€™ at the Vasant Vyakhyanmala (spring lecture series) on Tuesday.

Firodia said Pune was the only city in the world with more than a hundred thousand skilled engineers employed in top companies.

â€œIt shows there is no reason why India should not become an industrially advanced country, if its skilled people are brought together. Unfortunately, our industrial and economic growth remains stunted by antiquated labour laws and petty politics. We need to make the laws more flexible and open up to the idea of decentralising of the government. This will result in more transparency, less corruption, improvement in the standard of living and more economic growth,â€� Firodia said.

Firodia also underlined Indiaâ€™s huge potential in tourism. â€œEvery year, China has crores of tourists from all over the world coming to see just one thing - The Great Wall of China. While India, despite having hundreds of tourist hotspots, gets only 25 lakh tourists every year. Tourism is a lucrative market â€” behind every international tourist, there is employment opportunity for three people. The government, therefore, should try and give a much-needed push to the tourism sector,â€� Firodia said.

The agricultural sector is another one where India could emerge tops, Firodia said.

â€œCurrently with conventional farming techniques, a farmer earns not more than Rs 10, 000 per acre of agricultural land. However, if the farmer adopts modern techniques and varies crop patterns and selection all year round, the earnings per acre could touch Rs 80,000,â€� Firodia said.

3,Bandit queens rule the roost in Chambal,"LUCKNOW: After a lull, dacoit gangs are once again thriving in the ravines of Chambal. But this time, women seem to be catching up with men.

Struck by the halo attached to Phoolan Devi, former bandit- turned-politician, these women dacoits prefer to be known as Phoolan.

Gangs of women dacoits donâ€™t show much interest in loots and dacoities but prefer kidnappings, said an official of the home department. The modus operandi of these gangs, however, is quite different from one another.

Out of 30-32 gangs of dacoits active in the state, 10-12 are led by women.

Old hands like Kusuma Nain and Sarla Jatav often trap victims by befriending them and then asking for huge ransoms. The two have dodged the police many times.

Kiran alias Lovely Pandey of Etawah is moving around in the ravines along with her new friend Rajjan Gujjar. The MP and UP governments have declared a reward of Rs 70,000 and Rs 20,000 on her head respectively. Sarla Jatav of Delhi, a fairly new entrant, has earned a reputation of ruthlessness.

Though these women were members of the well- known dacoit gangs, the desire to carve a niche for them and forge ahead of men encouraged them to move away from their mentors.

4,Teenage culprit commits suicide,"KOLKATA: The murder case of 16-year-old Avijit Pal took a gruesome turn on Tuesday when the dismembered body of one of his assailants, Phanta Banik, was discovered near Bidhannagar railway station.

Banik, 19, had committed suicide by jumping in front of a running train. Banik was one of the eight teenage friends of Avijit accused of murdering him on Saturday. That day, the group of friends had dinner and liquor at a VIP Road hotel. After that they drove along Kalyani Expressway where Avijit was throttled to death.

The other teenagers -- Surojit Baidya, Sanjay Nag, Shankar Bhattacharjee, Nishit Roy, Rakhal Pal and Rajesh Poddar -- are in police custody. Police said the teens had tried to force Avijit to ask his father to cough up Rs 20,000. When he refused, Avijit was beaten up and throttled to death. His body was dumped at Amdanga. The Tata Sumo, in which the boys were travelling, has been recovered, but the driver is absconding.

Banik, who had given up studies a couple of years ago, married earlier this year and had started a business. His family members were flabbergasted by the turn of events.

Police superintendent, North 24-Parganas, Basudev Bag said money was not the sole motive behind Avijit''s murder. â€œWe have come to know that there was a dispute over a girl among these boys. But we are still investigating if that led to the murder,â€� he said.

Preliminary investigation revealed that Suroijit, a class XI student at Gurudas College, was the mastermind of the abduction and murder. Avijit was a Madhyamik student at Patipukur Pallishree Vidyalaya in Lake Town. Three of the arrested teenagers are students in a school at Muraripukur while the others have given up studies.

The mood at Dhaka Pati Shilpo Colony, where both Avijit and Phanta Banik lived, was sombre. Avijit''s father, sculptor Narayan Chandra Pal, told TNN, ""I had received an anonymous phone call on Sunday night. Still we had no clue about Avi''s whereabouts. The caller said the police could do nothing. He said, â€˜Catch Avi''s friends. They can throw light on the mystery''.""

The call led to the arrest of the culprits. Local residents first zeroed in on Rakhal Pal. He broke down and blurted out the entire story. Irate residents then caught the others and gave them a severe thrashing before the police stepped in.

7,BJP wins Warasia civic byelection,"VADODARA: The BJP on Tuesday secured a spectacular win in the crucial Ward 3 (Warasia) bypoll, held here on Sunday, by defeating the Congress party by a margin of 1,763 votes. While BJP candidate Gurumukhdas Hemanani won 3,610 votes, his close contender and Congress candidate Bhaghatsinh Bhaghiya secured 1,874 votes.

The three Independent candidates, Bhagvandas Maharaj, Nilesh Pandya and Yogesh Dabhi, shared 1,575 votes among themselves out of the total 7,032 valid votes that were polled.

The victory is being seen as a significant event by political analysts as BJP considers this win a harbinger to stay put for the remaining one-and-a-half-year term that is left with the party before the next municipal elections take place.

The party managed this victory after receiving overwhelming support from the predominant â€˜Ladlaâ€™ sect, present amongst the Sindhi community of Warasia, and the Marathi population spread across the Kalupur area. While BJP managed a total of 3,610 votes, Congress managed only 1,874 votes. The three independent candidates managed to secure 475, 695 and 405 votes respectively.

â€œSome of the important issues, like supply of clean drinking water and maintenance of drainage pipes in the area, have remained pending for a long time. Our priority now would be to take these issues into account and find immediate solutions to the problems,â€� said Mayor N V Patel.

8,Helmet rule put off till May 7,"HYDERABAD: Two-wheeler riders will have to wear helmets from May 7 to avoid fine by the traffic police.

However, pillion-riders have time until May 15 to wear the head gear, additional commissioner of city police (traffic) D T Naik said on Tuesday.

Addressing a press conference, he said even woman pillion-riders should wear helmets from May 15. Children below the age of 10 may be allowed to travel on two-wheelers without wearing helmets.

Naik said the police would start imposing fines from the said dates if two-wheeler riders and pillion-riders fail to stick to the helmet rule. ""It is May 7 for riders and May 15 for pillion-riders. That''s final,"" Naik said.

Asked if there were enough helmets in the market to meet the demand, Naik said, â€œIf the stocks go dry here, people can buy helmets from Bangalore and other places.â€�

9,BJP in safe mode over rally cost,"VADODARA: Reacting strongly to allegations that the state government was trying to gloss over expenses incurred by it to organise the fortythird anniversary of the state, BJP representatives at a press conference here stated that the party in its own capacity could raise the issue with the government and would discuss the feasibility of preparing an audit report once the mega event ended.

However, party insiders candidly admit that the magnanimous task of auditing the expenses becomes a dicey affair, especially, after many city based NGO''s, cultural and social welfare organisations volunteered to take part as well as organise events at their venue.

â€œWe are talking of auditing expenses incurred by nearly 40 odd institutions who have willingly come forward and have taken responsibilities to organise cultural events in their venue. Going individually to these institutions and collecting data would be an arduous task,"" said BJP MLA representing Sayajigunj Jitubhai Sukhadia.

Another senior party functionary under condition of anonymity said that most of the monetary contributions have not been accounted as they were not in a position to serve them receipts. ""People have come forward and contributed willingly towards organising this event. At this moment it is rather difficult to keep an account of the contributions. We as a party can always place our suggestions before the government,â€� he added.

10,Mission incomplete: Vohra,"SRINAGAR: The Centres interlocutor on Kashmir, N N Vohra on Tuesday admitted that his mission would be incomplete till he heard the extremist leaders, who have refused to talk to him.

He expressed the hope that the separatist groups, including the Hurriyat Conference, would meet him during his next visit.

â€˜â€˜The process of talks will not be complete unless we have heard and discussed with all those who are angry, unhappy, dissidents and sharing a different belief,â€™â€™ Vohra told reporters after wrapping up his nine-day visit to the Valley.

Vohra said he received letters and phone calls from several separatist leaders expressing their willingness to talk, but they did not want any publicity.

He said the K C Pant mission had also invited Hurriyat leaders for talks but they preferred to stay away.

Appealing to everyone to come forward and hold talks, the 66-year-old bureaucrat expressed confidence that those who had not met him â€˜â€˜will come forwardâ€™â€™ in his next visit to the Valley.

During his mission in Kashmir, Vohra met several leaders of various political parties including the National Conference, the ruling PDP and the Congress and discussed the Kashmir issue with them.

11,"Differences between BJP, BSP over UP govt booklet","LUCKNOW: With ties between the BSP and BJP, Uttar Pradesh''s ruling coalition partners, already frayed, a booklet released by the Mayawati government to mark completion of its first year in office has further annoyed the saffron party.

The booklet, listing the achievement of Mayawati government, says Mayawati had inherited a state which was in a poor financial health with worsening law and order situation and acute shortage of power -- a virtual indictment of the previous Rajah Singh government.

Singh has had reservations about BJP''s tie-up with BSP and criticised Mayawati government on a host of issues, including arrest of Independent MLA Raja Bhaiyya under Pota and filing of cases against Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.

Mayawati, in turn, had attacked Rajah Singh for coming in defence of Mulayam Singh Yadav on the issue of the use of chief minister''s discretionary fund.

The booklet, released by the information department, carried a picture of B R Ambedkar and the slogan ""Unki Disha: Prayas Hamare"" (Ambedkar''s direction and our efforts).

But there is no picture of BJP ideologues Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee nor do their names find mention anywhere in the booklet released by the information department recently. Mayawati completes one year in office on May 3.

It showers praise on Mayawati for ""leading the state into prosperity by tiding over financial crisis, tough administration, bringing about social equality and industrial development.""

Though names of Davit icons such as Ambedkar, Chhatrapati Sahuji Maharaj and Jyotirba Rao Phule find mention in the booklet, Upadhyaya and Mukherjee are nowhere.

State BJP leaders have taken exception to the exclusion of the party ideologues from the booklet saying it appears as if the government was being run by BSP only.

Further, depiction of the picture of Ambedkar on the cover page of the booklet reflected as if the government was implementing the agenda of BSP only and not the BJP, the leaders said preferring anonymity.

State BJP President Vinay Katiyar, who was reportedly asked by the party''s central leadership to tone down his criticism of Mayawati government on a range of issues, declined to comment on the issue.

12,Jaswant rules out VAT implementation from June 1,"NEW DELHI: Ruling out the implementation of Value Added Tax from June 1, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh on Wednesday announced several excise duty concessions on edible oil and textiles.

Winding up discussion on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha, Singh allayed apprehensions of members saying there was no proposal to bring in agriculture income tax in the country.

Singh said VAT cannot be implemented ""without full preparation being made by states as he was not in favour of any patchwork or partial implementation.""

He made it clear that reduction in Central sales tax from the present four per cent to two per cent is contingent upon implementation of VAT.

Singh, who was repeatedly interrupted by the BJP members, did not relent on the demand of increasing the excise exemption limit on small powerlooms to Rs 50 lakh from Rs 25 lakh he announced.

On agriculture income tax, Singh said, ""there is no proposal to levy any such income tax on agriculture. It is totally baseless and nobody should have any apprehension on this account.""

Bowing to the demand of the industry, Singh replaced the eight per cent ad valorem duty of excise on branded edible oils and vanaspati in sealed containers to one per cent per kg duty on edible oils and Rs 1.25 per kg on vanaspati.

He also reduced customs duty on refined palm oil by 15 per cent to 70 per cent.

Elaborating on the concessions to the textile sector, Singh said the powerlooms whose declared value of stocks do not exceed Rs 10,000 per loom will be exempt from scrutiny for tax purposes.

This will not have retrospective application or consequences, he said.

He said small powerlooms operating with eight to ten looms will be fully exempt from excise duty with the choice of registering or opting out of CENVAT.

Excise exemption for unbranded, woven and knitted readymade garments has been given with prescribed ceiling for clearance of Rs 25 lakh and an annual turnover of Rs 30 lakh.

Import duty on rags has been reduced from 25 per cent to five per cent and on hand processed fabrics, excise duty has been reduced from ten to five per cent.

Concessional customs duty of five per cent has been expanded to cover 117 more categories of textiles machinery and their parts besides extending customs duty of ten per cent to all twisters and rewinding machines.

On direct taxes, Singh announced 100 per cent tax exemptions to offshore banking units being set up in special economic zones (SEZs) for three years besides 50 per cent exemption for the subsequent two years.

He also exempted from income tax capital gains accruing to political parties.

The minister limited the exemption on long term capital gains on equity shares to only those appearing in the list of BSE 500 as on March 1, 2003 and where transactions were on a recognised stock exchange.

Exemptions were also extended to equity shares allotted through public issue on or after March 1 this year and listed in recognised stock exchanges before March 1, 2004.

Income earned on insurance policies taken before April one, 2003, would continue to enjoy tax exemptions.

In the face of demand to exempt sportspersons upto the age of 30 from paying income tax, Singh announced deduction of upto Rs 75,000 from the income received as professional fees to all sportsmen participating in games and sporting events.

Listing out indirect tax concessions, Singh announced that hand pumps would be fully exempt from excise duty.

Metcoke used in iron and steel industry would be exempted from special additional duty (SAD). So also, nickel oxide sinter and unwrought nickel used in steel making.

He also fully exempted from excise duty nictonine ploacrilex gum and reduced excise duty from 16 to eight per cent on tiles made by units not using electricity or petroleum fuel for firing the kilns but used firewood or other agro-waste.

He reduced customs duty on specified capital equipment for IT industry from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.

Customs duty on decorative transparent films and dyestuffs used in the manufacturing of writing instruments have been reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent.

On VAT, the minister said there would be no departure from the agreed list of commodities that were to be subject to 12.5 per cent rate of VAT and all state legislations must conform with the model VAT legislation circulated to them earlier.

13,Govt pursuing faulty PDS policy: Oppn,"NEW DELHI: The Opposition on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on government in the Rajya Sabha accusing it of pursuing a ""faulty"" public distribution system (PDS) policy resulting in malnutrition and starvation deaths despite huge stocks of foodgrains in FCI godowns.

He quoted remarks made by Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the Supreme Court and the CAG to say that severe lacunae existed in the PDS which needed urgent attention of the government.

During the course of the debate, Deputy Chairperson Najma Heptulla pointed out that instead of rats eating foodgrains in godowns, they could be given to the needy.

Responding to members'' concern, Food Minister Sharad Yadav admitted that the mid-day meal had faced some problems but asserted it was now running smoothly.

Pachouri and A Vijayaraghavan (CPI-M) demanded that the Centre should immediately convene a meeting of chief ministers to ensure that poverty-sticken people were provided foodgrains at affordable prices.

17,What is delaying arrest of SMO in the dock?,"MUKTSAR: The registration of a criminal case against a senior medical officer (SMO) by the Muktsar police for bungling about Rs one crore has caught many senior officers in the health department off guard, more so, because he is known to have alleged proximity with those who matter in the department.

Secretary health, Rupan Deol Bajaj issued orders for the suspension of SMO Sohan Lal Arora and for registering another case against him. But the latter has filed a writ petition against the Muktsar civil surgeon and the secretary health in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, demanding cancellation of the FIR.

A case under Sections 409, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B (cheating and forgery) of the IPC was registered against the SMO last week for duping the department using fake documents.

The case was registered after the alleged cheating by the SMO was highlighted in The Times of India.

Though cheating by the doctor, the then SMO at a primary health centre in Chak Sherewala village, was disclosed about five months back, action was delayed on one pretext or the other due to his alleged proximity with some important persons in the department at Chandigarh.

The case was registered after Muktsar deputy commissioner asked for an inquiry in the cheating case, taking a suo motu notice of media reports.

The inquiry indicted the doctor for swindling about Rs one crore, said the sources. He was accused of duping the department by withdrawing the amount from the treasury as arrears of salary and dearness allowance by furnishing duplicate bills in the name of the staff members of the primary health centre while no such arrears were pending. He also prepared a back dated fake letter in the name of the secretary health showing him promoted.

After his suspension, the SMO is living at his residence in Sector 30-A, Chandigarh. Even after the chief secretary asking the Muktsar civil surgeon to register another case against the doctor for cheating the department of another Rs 4.42 lakh, the police are reportedly not taking much interest in arresting the doctor.

Again his alleged relations with senior officers at Chandigarh is reportedly acting as saving grace.

When contacted, Muktsar civil surgeon SS Toor said that he had written to the senior superintendent of police, Muktsar and station house officer (SHO), Muktsar sadar for registering a case against the SMO. But the SSP and SHO were not available to comment on the delay in the SMOâ€™s arrest.
