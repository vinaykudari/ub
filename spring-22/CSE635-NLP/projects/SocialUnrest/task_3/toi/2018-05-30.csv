1,Panchayat results make mockery of election rules,"patna: the mysterious ways of the state election commission in the conduct of the panchayat elections is reportedly creating a furore in all corners of the state. ambiguous and debatable election rules framed by it has added to the confusion. ""lack of transparency and ambiguous decisions by returning officers (ros) is bound to precipitate a flurry of election petitions before the already overburdened civil courts,"" stated amar nath thakur of panchayat helpline, set up by a network of ngos in the state. defeated and harassed panchayat poll candidates have been incessantly ringing up the panchayat helpline seeking ways and means to get justice from a recalcitrant bureaucracy. ""there have been quite a few close results where the margin of victory or defeat has been in single digit,"" he said. in a few panchayats in west champaran, votes were allegedly recounted thrice. the loser in each case has cried foul. in gopalganj, the returning officer declared gulab rai elected as panchayat samiti member on the third count. rai, the brother of rjd mukhiya laloo prasad yadav, won by 22 votes. while the state election commission remains media shy, inquiries by the times of india revealed that a handbook of instructions issued to returning officers clearly laid down that, in no case, votes can be recounted more than once. while the defeated candidates are being denied even certified copies of different election related documents, the aggrieved candidates are hard pressed to agitate their complaints before the courts. the handbook says that the documents can be handed over for scrutiny only on the orders of competent court or tribunal. a perusal of the bihar panchayati raj act and rules shows that the jurisdiction to adjudicate such election matters lies with civil courts. but in the absence of relevant documents being denied to them, aggrieved candidates are even experiencing difficulties in getting their plaints drafted. as a result, the potential plaintiffs have no option but to file suits on the basis of their allegations supported by affidavits.

""the candidates were denied an agent at each table only to allow mischief by officials,"" senior nda leaders alleged. while the panchayat election results are being dogged with one controversy or the other in different corners of the state, the civil courts face the prospect of being deluged with loads of election petitions. ""this will negate the good start made by lok adalats in reducing the burden of courts,"" said amar nath thakur. ""panchayat poll related litigation could have been bare minimum only if the state election commission and poll officials been equitable and transparent in the conduct of elections,"" he added.

""the constitutional rights of the state ministers would be protected and they would be involved in all important decisions of their departments,"" the cm said. to achieve this objective, he said a meeting of the council of ministers would be called in the first week of june. talking to newspersons on tuesday, amar mani tripathi said they had brought their grievances to the notice of chief ministers in the past, but no effort had been made to find a proper solution. he said it was an irony that the files which passed from a clerk to the cabinet minister through an under-secretary, special secretary and secretary, were not shown to them. he said they came to know about important decisions of their departments only through newspapers. they were being neglected by the bureaucracy at all levels, he alleged. when it was suggested that this was perhaps because the council of ministers was too large, tripathi and another state minister, satish sharma, said the real problem was that the number of officers was too large and they were leading a lavish life at the cost of the state exchequer.

5,Fiasco over ministers' room allotment not over,"kolkata: the fiasco over allotment of rooms of ministers in the west bengal state secretariat does not seem to end. on tuesday, it took a new turn with nayan sarkar, minister of state for refugee rehabilitation, occupying the room meant for minister of state for sunderban affairs kanti ganguly. when ganguly arrived later in the day, he was visibly upset by seeing sarkar's name stuck below his on the chamber door. it was a ironical situation, as he had virtually done the same thing a fortnight ago by storming into this chamber, which originally belonged to minister of state for irrigation and waterways ganesh mondal. ganguly spent the rest of the day at the chamber of state transport minister subhas chakraborty. sarkar, although not available for comment, still has some logic in having a chamber at the state secretariat, as his department has all its offices here. this is not the case with ganguly, as his department offices are housed in salt lake. after several days had passed since his taking oath, sarkar was finally allotted a room outside the protected area. but according to the secretariat's grapevine, sarkar has not been happy with this allotment, and thus comes the move on tuesday. however, ganguly chose to play the tragic hero. ""sarkar does not yet have a room in writers', so i have asked him to sit in my room till arrangements are made for him,"" ganguly said as he left the secretariat. ""i will sit in my salt lake chamber till the arrangements are complete,"" he added. he had a strange explanation for his wanting a chamber at writers. ""i have to co-ordinate with several departments here _ forests, pwd urban development and others,"" he said. pwd minister, amar choudhuri, was visibly ruffled by the developments. ""no one spoke to me while making these arrangements. the pwd has not made any such allotment,"" he said. ""i will speak to the chief minister about this,"" he added.

6,NH 31A should be open irrespective of bandh: CM,"kolkata: the west bengal government should take steps to ensure that national highway 31a remains open even if there is a bandh in the darjeeling hills. this was stated by sikkim chief minister pawan chamling in his meeting with state chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee on tuesday. ""nh 31a is the lifeline of sikkim. if that closes down, the entire life of the state is disrupted,"" chamling told newspersons after the meeting. the highway forms the only connection between sikkim and the rest of the country, passing from siliguri through the darjeeling hills. as a result, whenever there is a bandh call, which has been quite frequent in recent months, especially after the attack on darjeeling gorkha hill council chairman subash ghisingh, this mountainous state has had to face tremendous problems. ""nh 31a is a national highway, and thus is not the property of a particular state. thus the west bengal government should arrange for the highway to remain open even if there is a bandh in the darjeeling hills,"" chamling said. the sikkim cm is in the city for an interactive session with cii. he is accompanied by ministers of the housing and public works, transport, agri-horticulture, forests, tourism, power and industry, along with the chief secretary and the director general of police. the sikkim government has sought the state government's co-operation in the tourism, food processing, horticulture and transport. ""sikkim is a totally land-locked state. we cannot survive without the support of west bengal and its people,"" chamling said. bhattacharjee admitted that there were problems regarding the disruption of traffic along nh 31a. ""there are problems. we are looking into the matter,"" he said. he has accepted chamling's offer for co-operation in specified sectors. ""the concerned departments will soon meet in siliguri,"" he said.

7,'Archaic laws hurdle in nabbing criminals',"kolkata: police officials in kolkata feel amendments to some of the archaic police laws will go a long way in better prevention and detection of crimes. for, there are too many laws and many of them have become obsolete. city police chief sujoy chakraborty believes that photographing criminals in respective city police stations would act as a deterrent against crime. ""if the fear of getting photographed gets instilled in the mind of a criminal, once he is taken to a police station, then that particular criminal may think twice before indulging in any criminal activity"", he said. but, again the law prevents it. ""under the 'identification of prisoners act, 1920', the police cannot force any 'criminal' to get photographed, unless he volunteers or the court issues an order"", said chakraborty, claiming that it is highly illegal. he stressed that 'filing photos' sometimes obstruct in judicial investigation. however, a large number of officers manning police stations do not share to that view, fully. most of them, off the record, said that the crime record section of the city's detective department keeps a detailed bio-data and a photo of any criminal caught. ""the commissioner of police has also issued an order to that effect. the order states that any hardened criminal, well-known extortionist or pick-pocketer, if caught in any police station, needs to be referred to the crs"", said an officer of the park street police station.

8,PM rules out Mamata's return to NDA fold,"new delhi: prime minister vajpayee on tuesday ruled out the possibility of mamata banerjee's trinamul congress returning to the national democratic alliance. however, senior party sources said she is scheduled to meet home minister advani and parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan on thursday here. mamata reportedly wants to be given some time to consider rejoining the nda. as things stand, the fact that she left the nda to team up with the congress just a few months before the assembly elections has given her the reputation of being temperamental and whimsical. now, if she returns to the nda immediately, it will do nothing to enhance her credibility. on the contrary, if she does not join up now, she risks a split in her party. while ajit panja has already quit, four others - ranjit panja, krishna bose, bikram sarkar and nistish sengupta - are also waiting in line to follow suit. the only thing that could stop them, sources say, is the vajpayee government's disinclination to hand out ministerial berths to them. mamata is, therefore, seeking time to get her act together. senior bjp sources said that the party may just do that. a party leader said: ""we believe that she is still the only bulwark against the left in west bengal. we would not want to weaken her."" in any case, with the pm ruling out any ministerial reshuffle, ministry expansion till close to parliament's monsoon session, there is still over a month to go. sources within the bjp note that any ministry expansion will have to wait till after the pm's knee operation, which will be followed by the visit of gen pervez musharraf.

""the purpose is to give a more cohesive image to the government and by no way to muffle the ministers,"" yechuri remarked. a minister from now on will not be allowed to comment publicly on the performance of his or her colleagues. the ministers will also not have the authority to declare new policies before discussing them in the cabinet, the note says. ""learn to avoid making controversial statements about the cabinet,"" the note specifically instructs them. the note, accepted earlier during a meeting of the left front leaders, also declares that review of the performance of the ministers would be undertaken at least once every year and the left front committee would meet at least twice every three months to speed up the works of the government. while the chief minister would coordinate the activities of the individual ministers, all the constituents parties of the front would regularly monitor the performance of their ministers, says the note. speaking at the meeting, chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee put a premium on the need for making the government more dynamic. former chief minister jyoti basu, who also attended the meeting, urged the leaders to consolidate the unity of the front. the victory in the recently held polls had come largely because of the front's unity, basu said. the unity of the front must percolate down to the districts to supervise the activities of the district administration, zilla parishads, panchayat samities and the gram panchayats, he said.
