0,A big rally and quiet weddings,"HYDERABAD: Amply warned of a likely disruption and traffic chaos, those scheduled to tie the knot on Sunday moved in to the community halls they had booked earlier well in advance.

In a way, this came as a huge plus, with extended families getting to spend a lot of time together. They caught up with each other, ate together and on the whole had a whale of a time.

â€œMy friend, Srikanthâ€™s brother has come all the way from Australia to get married. We were determined not to allow anyone play party pooper,â€� said Arun Kumar. Arun, along with his friends and the families of the bride and the groom had moved into the Banjara Function Hall, Banjara Hills on Saturday night for a wedding that was solemnised at 12 noon on Sunday.

â€œWe were not sure how bad the traffic would be, so we decided not to take any chances and moved in to the function hall one whole night early,â€� Arun said. At the Jooluri Vajramma Kalyana Mandapam, Karkhana, Secunderabad, a marriage function is scheduled at night. â€œWe have a marriage scheduled at 8 pm and we held our party in the morning, thereâ€™s no problem. The wedding will take place as planned,â€� a worker said.

Not many marriages were cancelled, though the turnouts could have been on the lesser side. â€œWe had a hard time getting to the marriage reception in Himayatnagar as the traffic was jammed in many places,â€� B Divya, a resident of Tarnaka said. Some other function halls hosted TDP supporters â€” like at the Kapu Sangham Function hall, where more than 200 participants were put up.

1,Govt on spending spree before polls,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has been busy sanctioning money for pet projects fearing the Election Commission might notify Lok Sabha polls and the model code of conduct might kick into place.

NEW DELHI: Nothing loosens the purse strings of the government faster than a looming election.

The Delhi government has been busy sanctioning money and fixing paper work for pet projects fearing the Election Commission (EC) might notify Lok Sabha polls and the model code of conduct might kick into place.

Every week, two to three meetings of the expenditure finance committee (EFC) have been taking place for this purpose. Projects worth Rs 600 crore were sanctioned in January alone and February''s total equals Rs 400 crore already.

Cleared proposals include the micro-surfacing of Mall Road and parts of Ring Road for Rs 158 crore, the establishment of a laboratory for fibre optics at Delhi College of Engineering (DCE) for Rs 112 crore and the remodelling of five drains at the cost of Rs 29 crore. These projects have been awaiting clearance since September, 2003.

Delhi finance minister A K Walia has also been holding meetings for checking how much of the plan fund various departments have managed to spend.

""We also have been asking departments to come up with whatever projects they have in mind so that these may get off the ground before the General Elections get notified,"" he said.

According to sources in the finance department, the extra hours put in by the department now, are being justified on the grounds that after elections are notified, none of these meetings will be allowed.

""Elections would mean a sort of holiday for us,"" said an official.

Not just the finance department, other departments with some plan funds, are busy allocating them to projects of their choice.

Revenue and development minister Raj Kumar Chauhan has sanctioned more than Rs 150 crore to his pet project of developing model villages in the outskirts of the city.

""If not sanctioning the entire amount, at least our paper work is complete, which will leave us on the safe side,"" said Chauhan.

2,Go natural on Holi: govt,"NEW DELHI: With Holi, the festival of colours, barely 10 days away, the environment department of the Delhi government has gone into an overdrive cautioning Delhiites about the harmful side-effects of chemical, non-organic colours.

Apart from listing out the side-effects of chemical based colours, the environment department''s website tells people how to make natural, safe colours.

""This is a continuation of a campaign held last year,"" said Delhi environment minister Raj Kumar Chauhan. In last year''s campaign, the Delhi government had put up a stall at Dilli Haat and gave shoppers an opportunity to buy natural colours.

""We will be taking out some advertisements in the run up to Holi. We have already put up some information on the website on how to make natural herbal colours,"" said Chauhan.

The health hazards of using chemical based colours include skin cancer, renal failure and temporary blindness and bronchial asthma.

Natural herbal colours can be made by using everyday fruits and vegetables at home. For example, the wet red colour can be obtained by boiling pomegranate peels in water.

The campaign is based on the fact that cases of skin allergy and asthma show a rise after the festival.

3,Plane safety: govt needs crash course,"BANGALORE: The recent crash of a fighter plane in Jamnagar has confirmed that much of IAFâ€™s MiG-raine is avoidable, inflicted essentially by government apathy. Cutting to chase, the MiG-21sâ€™ notorious crash rate is clearly due to inexplicable delays in acquiring critical spares and Advanced Jet Trainers.

Sources confirm the government has been dragging its feet over the purchase of vital safety equipment, impacting directly on the performance of the ageing fighters. ""There is a particular class of procurement, critical to safety, which needs to be put on fast track,"" defence aviation experts said.

""They are forced to cannibalise engines, generators and all sorts of critical spare parts, imperiling the aircraftâ€™s safety. You donâ€™t change spare parts from one car to another, leave alone aircraft,"" IAF insiders said.

For a taste of the complacency, sample this. An official says the IAF has waited more than 10 years for 60 Crash Fire Tenders (CFTs). The CFTs in the IAF inventory are outdated and ineffective when it comes to handling emergencies. ""Either they are not working or the water throw is not enough. They need to be replaced immediately.â€�

Even as debate rages on whether spares should be imported or indigenous, the government has ignored what is irrefutably its responsibility. Procuring aircraft and spares is clearly not the IAFâ€™s headache.

Here is another shocking sample. Sources say the bodies of the two pilots who died in a MiG-21 crash two years ago at Tezpur are yet to be recovered. The rescue-and-detection equipment on-board that ill-fated fighter too remain untraced. Beeping beacons that guide rescue teams to crash sites are basic gadgets, but even these are not available to the IAF, an insider said. ""It will never happen in any country with a modern air force.""

Floats for surveillance helicopters, critical because many a time these helicopters are required to land on water, are not available either. ""For years, the government has not procured them."" The Arun Singh Committee that examined the reasons for high accident rates had recommended that the government must transfer procurement powers to the IAF. But the finance ministry has not relented.

The delay in the acquisition of a modern trainer aircraft in the Hawk class exemplifies the sort of government apathy that has plagued the IAF. When you have a modern aircraft with glass cockpits, you should have modern training systems as well. The IAF does not have even simulators or other modern equipment to train on the ground. ""If there is government apathy, and excessive bureaucratic control, then the IAF leadership should fight it,"" say insiders.

A senior official wondered why there should be government control over contract for spares. ""It is a shame that the Indian industry has not concentrated on developing the spares of an aircraft that has been flying since 1963. All these factors bring down the morale of our pilots.""

4,Vajpayee to seek re-election from Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said today he would seek re-election from Lucknow in the coming Lok Sabha polls.

""I do not want to disappoint the people of Lucknow,"" he told a meeting of party workers, Sangh Parivar members and office-bearers of BJP''s frontal wings here.

5,'No SMS deal for polls so far',"NEW DELHI: Cellular companies said they have not been approached by any political party so far for bulk deals to carry their election messages to voters through SMS.

The firms said they would not be directly involved with such a move other than just being carriers of SMS. They cited technical and ethical reasons for deciding not to push the messages and said revenue from such a move would not be substantial.

Airtel chief Manoj Kohli, however, said the technology to classify consumers on various parameters was available and messages could be sent without difficulty. Other firms said all unsolicited messages would tantamount to spam.

6,"Development in, Ram mandir out of BJP agenda: PM","LUCKNOW: Addressing a press conference on Monday here, the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said that the party will highlight the achievements of its five year rule at the Center instead of focusing on Ram mandir.

The temple, emphasised the PM, was not an election issue but was more of a emotional issue for the masses. He further added that the temple would certainly be constructed in Ayodhya but only by common a consensus.

While evading a direct query whether the temple issue will figure in the election manifesto of the BJP, he quipped, ""You find out when the manifesto comes before you.""

Playing down controversial issues by side-stepping expertly and making light of them by clever play of words, the PM gave one of the most lack lustre performance in his home constituency.

The famous wit and spark was missing as a tired and obviously preoccupied Vajpayee prompted by the senior BJP leaders flanking him, tried hard to defend the partyâ€™s stand on most of the contentious issues.

So, he was quick to rise in defence of the ""feel good"" factor and dismissed the allegation

that there was hardly any feel good factor in UP. He expressed confidence that his party would succeed in meeting the target of bagging 60 seats in the state. ""Although UP, as against states which have straight contests presented a complicated picture.""

Rubbishing all claims that the government had failed to provide employment to youth as promised, he said the job opportunities had gone up in different sectors, however his detractors deliberately failed to notice them. Much is made out of paucity of office jobs, he said and pointed out that sectors like construction or khadi gramodyog had provided ample scope for employment. The government had given employment to 80 lakh people as against the target of one crore, the PM claimed.

Admitting that the law and order situation in UP needed to be improved, he refused to comment upon the government''s alleged failure in booking the killers of his grand nephew Manish who was thrown off a running rain last month. ""The investigation is on and I am sure law will take its own course,"" the PM declared.

However the question about his party''s decision to induct the controversial DP Yadav had the PM pause and fumble. ""We try to take all precautions to keep people with criminal records out,"" Vajpayee remarked. And added, there was no ""contradiction in BJPs decision in taking in a mafia don, whose son, a prime accused in Nitish Katar murder case, is still behind bars.

However, about the delay due to political reasons in the Raja Bhaiya''s release, as alleged by the opposition, Vajpayee said that lifting Pota was a different cup of tea and it entailed clearance by a committee. Pota, he added was directly connected with the maintenance of law and order in the state and should not be made an object of political interference.

The question, if UP faced Assembly elections simultaneously with the Parliament, the PM said that such a demand was being raised from several quarters and the matter was under consideration. Later however, prompted by Rajnath Singh he said the statement did not apply only to UP but to all other states as well.

7,IT firms brace themselves for another bandh,"KOLKATA: Laminated stickers to proclaim their new public utility status â€” for IT companies in Kolkata that would be about the only change in the ground situation on Tuesday, since the last bandh-call on February 3.

Infotech majors in Kolkata said the magic tag conferred on them â€” with much fanfare on September 26 last year, which technically put them outside the purview of bandhs â€” meant precious little, if the experience with the earlier bandh this month was any indicator.

""We are bracing ourselves for another hard day tomorrow (Tuesday),"" a candid Suresh Menon, chief operating officer of the cityâ€™s largest call centre BNKeSolutions, said on bandh-eve.

""The stickers (which started being handed over by Webel last week) by themselves cannot guarantee a safe passage to work. We are making our own arrangements to have employees stay over either at the office or guest houses nearby (on Monday) so that the risks involved are minimised,"" added Menon, who himself is preparing to park himself at the office for the next two days to ensure that everything goes without a hitch.

Cognizant Technology Solutions vice-president Siddhartha Mukherjee echoed similar sentiments. ""What use stickers? The car rental companies are hesitant to hire out cars to pick up our employees because they are either short of drivers or afraid that their vehicles may be damaged by protesters.""

""We are spending the better part of today (Monday) discussing logistics of how to keep the show going as normally as possible. The new status has not proved any help thus far,"" Mukherjee asserted. Cognizant is one of the biggest players at the electronics complex at Salt Lake.

Mukherjee has good reason to feel this way. The biggest association of government employees in West Bengal, the State Co-ordination Committee, said on Monday that as far as it was concerned IT just could not be kept on the same plane as other public utility services. ""IT is not part of essential services and will remain shut tomorrow (Tuesday),"" its secretary Smarajit Roychoudhury said.

So what is the government stand on this issue? And its ramifications on the stateâ€™s image?

State IT minister Manab Mukherjee said he was leaving it entirely to the IT sector employees to make a choice about whether they should report for work on bandh-day. ""If anyone wants to work tomorrow, he can do it. There will be adequate police arrangements (to ensure normalcy),"" he said. ""As far as image is concerned, it is not something that is created in a day or destroyed by one particular incident.""

8,Hi-tech Krishna govt looted poor: Gowda,"BANGALORE: After ""promising"" a special court to try ""corrupt"" Congress ministers, JD(S) national president H D Deve Gowda on Monday vowed to prepare a charge sheet containing ""illegal dealings"" of the S M Krishna government.

""I will place the charge sheet with documentary evidence before the public. Let them decide which party is honest and sincere,"" he said addressing a press conference here.

He alleged that the state government had looted public money. ""Their policies aimed at providing hi-tech governance has emptied the poor man''s pockets. I will expose every misdeed committed by this government,"" he added.

The former Prime Minister accused the Congress of attempting to ""demolish"" his family and career. ""They have hatched innumerable conspiracies against me. I will overcome all of them,"" he asserted.

Expressing confidence that JD(S) would capture power, Gowda stated that Congress was facing revolt from its party workers. ""Krishna is under the impression that advertisements in the media will fetch him votes. But he should realise that even a lower rung government official is waiting for the Congress reign to end,"" he said.

Gowda, who met governor T N Chaturvedi in the morning, urged him not to grant assent to the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act, 2004. ""This Act, which contains serious lapses, was passed hurriedly in the legislature. The governor has responded positively,"" he maintained.

Former Congress minister Prabhakar Rane and ex-MLAs Gopal Mukund Ranade (Sirsi) and Venkatesh (HD Kote) joined JD(S) in the presence of Gowda.

9,AIPJD seeks governor's rule,"BANGALORE: The AIPJD on Monday sought imposition of governor''s rule in Karnataka in view of the dissolution of the state assembly.

Addressing a press conference here, AIPJD leader B. Somashekar expressed fears that the Congress government would misuse administration during elections. ""If free and fair elections are to be conducted, then governor''s rule is a must,"" he added.

He felt that S M Krishna should not be allowed to continue as caretaker chief minister. ""The government has already started mobilisation of funds for elections in an organised manner. Hundreds of acres of land have been denotified and sold to developers,"" he alleged.

Somashekar further alleged that the government had received ""kickbacks"" for issuing ''no objection certificate'' to private companies to mine iron ore.

""There is a great demand for iron ore mined from Chitradurga and Bellary districts in China. The private companies are funding politicians to receive NOCs,'' he said and demanded a judicial probe into the matter.

10,'Terrorists' still hiding in tribal areas: Pak minister,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday said that some militants of al-Qaeda were still hiding in Waziristan tribal agency bordering Afghanistan and asked the tribal elders to search and hand them over.

Pakistan Interior Minister, Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayyat told reporters here today that the tribal elders of South and North Waziristan have handed over some of the al-Qaeda suspects hiding there in the past.

""But some of them are still hiding there and the Government of Pakistan would take every step to arrest them,"" he said.

Asked if there is any new operation launched in South and North Waziristan or in border areas in Balochistan, the minister said, ""There is nothing new but the government has launched a full-fledge campaign to block the entry of terrorists from Afghanistan for one year.""

His remarks followed media reports that US forces have identified the location where Osama bin Laden is hiding.

Hayat however rejected the reports suggesting that some 8000 new army troops have been deployed in South Waziristan for a joint Pak-US operation.

""Our paramilitary and Pakistan Army troops are already deployed there in line with our resolves to uproot terrorism from our society-no fresh deployment of Pakistan Army troops nor it is required.""

11,State govt should conduct census of disabled people,"PUNE: Social workers and experts working for the welfare of disabled children have urged the state government to conduct a comprehensive survey of the total number of disabled people in the state.

Sharing their views and ideas at the state level meeting on ""Education for special-abled children"" at YMCA on Monday, social workers and experts said the government was busy making new policies but failing to implement them effectively.

Meena Gokhale, a co-ordinator from city based Save The Children organisation said nearly 70 million people in the country are dif-ferently abled. ""However, only one percent of them have access to proper education. A decade has passed but the central government has still not managed to prepare a population census of disabled citizens in the country,"" she rued.

Gokhale suggested the state government should independently conduct a comprehensive survey of the total number of disabled people in the state. ""In addition to this, research and documentation centres should be established in every district level,"" she suggested.

Social workers stressed on the importance of implementing the integrated education of disabled children (IEDC) scheme in a more effective manner all across the state. However, they strongly felt that suggestion made by differently abled children should be taken into consideration.

Currently, the IEDC scheme is being implemented at approximately 38 schools in Maharashtra. However, unequal distribution of policies has created a rift whereby the benefits are being enjoyed more by than urban disabled population and less by the rural one people, observed social workers and experts from the Spastic Society of India, Mumbai, Vachan from Nasik, city based Prism Foundation and MIRA among others.

Vasant Kalpande, director of the state''s primary education directorate expressed his gratitude toward the suggestions made by the social workers and experts. ""We will try and incorporate some of the educational suggestions made by some experts on priority basis,"" Kalpande assured.

12,More poll sops: Water charges for farmers cut,"GANDHINAGAR: In a major pre-poll sop, the Modi government has provided major relief on irrigation water charges, to Gujarat''s farmers.

The move, aimed at appeasing the farmers who are still upset with the high power tariff, was announced by water resources minister Narottam Patel in the state assembly on Monday.

Irrigation water charges for sugarcane and paddy, which were earlier to go up by 25 per cent per year, as decided in early 2001, would not go up by 15 per cent per year.

The Gujarat government had hiked irrigation charges by 2.2 times in early 2001 on advise from the Manu Shroff committee appointed to reform the two decades old stagnant user charges on water, power and other services provided by the Gujarat government.

The minister also announced a cut in irrigation rates for all crops for South and Central Gujarat, making them uniform all over the state,with retrospective effect from 2001. Thus, lower irrigation rates applicable for North Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch would now be applicable to farmers of Central and South Gujarat too.

Of new rates applicable on all farmers irrigating their fields with canal waters in South and Central Gujarat, Patel said that sugarcane growers would now be paying Rs 1,870 per hectare per season, instead of Rs 2,280. For banana, the farmers would be paying Rs 1,500 instead of Rs 1,830.

The rates for other crops are â€” paddy Rs 300 instead of Rs 360; bajri and jowar Rs 70 instead of Rs 90; groundnut Rs 180 instead of Rs 220; vegetables Rs 110 instead of Rs 130; wheat and mustard Rs 200 instead of Rs 240.

Suggesting that the state exchequer would lose Rs 19 crore per year with this new decision, Patel said, ""Central and South Gujarat farmers would have to pay Rs 13.96 crore less by applying uniform rates for the whole state.

There were numerous representations from MLAs to lower the water charges and hence we decided on the move,"" Patel said adding, ""We do not think it is against the spirit of economic reforms. Providing water is a social service. We must provide it cheap.""

Significantly, the government reduced the user charges for water within weeks of it deciding to bring down the power rates for farmers, putting additional burden on the exchequer.

Power rates were brought down after bitter protests by farmers in the entire state. This is the second time that the state has had to reduce power rates, despite CM''s tough stand earlier to not reduce them any further.

13,"Modi govt just surviving on hype, says Cong","GANDHINAGAR: The opposition Congress on Monday criticised the Narendra Modi government for just creating a hype around development of the state and fresh investments, without anything substantial happening on the ground.

Congress MLAs criticised the huge expenditure on the hype around the Navratri and Makarsankranti festivals which, they said, have failed to attract desired investments from NRIs.

While participating in a debate on the motion of thanks to governor''s address, they said such wasteful expenditure was not justified when the state heavily depended on borrowings.

They alleged that suicides due to extreme poverty had increased in the state. The graph of serious crimes like rape, murder and dacoity has gone up alarmingly.

Senior Congress member from Kutch Babubhai Meghji Shah accused the Modi government of meting out stepmotherly treatment to Kutch in regard to water supply schemes and warned that if such attitude continued, he would even demand statehood for Kutch.

While initiating the debate from the opposition side, leader of Opposition Amarsinh Chaudhary said the BJP ascended power by inciting people''s religious feelings. He cited the famous dialogue of Modi against Pakistan president ''Miyan'' Musharraf. And now Modi refrains from making any mention of Musharraf since Prime Minister Vajpayee has extended hands to Pakistan .

Referring to the government''s poor performance on the industrial front, Chaudhary said faulty policies have pushed industries to the brink of a crisis. The situation was worst in Surat where four textile units owned by a former textile minister had closed down.

Parliamentary minister Ashok Bhatt demanded that Chaudhary should give details of the four units or he should apologise for his false statement about the Union minister. As Chaudhary did not oblige, Speaker Mangalbhai Patel expunged the remarks.

Two senior members, Bharatsinh Solanki and Arjun Modhvadia, said Modi was criticised by even the RSS for his anti-farmer stance. They said the government faced a financial crisis and had failed to make allocations for the Narmada project.

However, water resources minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma retaliated that the Narmada project was delayed because of the Congress-supported Medha Patker''s agitation. In fact, the Congress should persuade the Maharashtra government to do its bit to raise the dam height to 110 metres.
