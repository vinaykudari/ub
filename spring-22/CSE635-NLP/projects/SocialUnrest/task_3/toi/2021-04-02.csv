0,Medical tests rule out rape in Antop Hill case,"MUMBAI: Medical tests conducted on the six-year-old girl from Antop Hill, who was abducted and assaulted by two men on Tuesday, show that she was not raped.

However, Sion hospital dean Dr M E Yeolekar said that although the pathological test was negative, the findings of the forensic and clinical tests are suggestive of physical abuse.

The girl has abrasions on the chest and a swelling on one eyebrow. She is now in stable condition at Sion hospital and will be discharged in a few days.

The assault took place on Tuesday in a deserted building close to the office of an assistant police commissioner.

The girl, a resident of SangamNagar in Antop Hill, was lured from her home by two neighboursâ€”Shamimullah, 19, and Niaz Ahmed Hussain, 18â€”to a residential colony a little distance away.

1,Elections may affect development,"MUMBAI: Development activity and relief work in drought areas in Maharashtra are expected to be severely affected due to the long absence of senior and low-ranking state government officials, who have been requisitioned for poll duty in different parts of the country, according to sources in Mantralaya.

Upto 110 IAS officers across the state, including principal secretaries and chief executive officers of zilla parishads, have been appointed as election observers for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.

The worst-affected would be the 11 drought-hit districts in western Maharashtra and Marathwada, where day-today monitoring of the ongoing relief worksâ€”like despatching water tankers or setting up new cattle campsâ€”is required. The code of conduct has already prevented the ministers and local MLAs from reviewing the relief works.

â€œPeople nursing grievances will have to wait and we fear the hardship which they may face during this periodmay turn them against the ruling Democratic Front,â€™â€™ a minister said.

Chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar, however, sought to allay these fears and said, â€œWe have instructed all our officials to conduct a review from time to time and ensure that relief work in the water-starved areas is not hit.â€™â€™

Another official, however, said, â€œKnowing the sarkari officials devotion to work and the speed with which they take decisions, the absence of the top officials will affect functioning in the districts.â€™â€™

2,Property dealers arrested for fraud,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police have arrested two property dealers who allegedly took refund of the excess payment made to the DDA by those who wanted to purchase the self-financing scheme flats floated in 1996.

The accused reportedly opened bank accounts in the name of original allottees to facilitate the payments.

Deputy commissioner of police (economic offence wing) Dinesh Bhat said: ""In the first case, the complainant is from Chandigarh. H C Goel had given power of attorney to accused Ajay Gupta.

Under the scheme, the original allottees became applicable for a refund. Gupta reportedly opened a joint account at Canara Bank in Rohini. But when the refund was encashed, Gupta withdrew the amount for himself.

5,Consumers protest cable tariff hike,"KOLKATA: Consumer activists in the city have lashed out at local cablemenâ€™s attempts to hike cable channel rates in the garb of service tax.

â€œThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India notification of December 26, 2003, imposed a status quo on cable tariffs at the consumer end. The order cannot be violated,â€� Federation of Consumer Associations of West Bengal Mala Banerjee said.

Many cable operators around the city have been urging viewers to pay 8 per cent service tax. While every subscriber has to pay the tax, activists pointed out that the Excise department had imposed the tax since August 2002 and not now.

â€œCable operators who are now asking subscribers to pay service tax, have been defaulting on the payment. Not even half the cable operators issue bills to subscribers. Since a consolidated sum is charged, operators cannot demand a separate service tax unless it mentions it in a bill,â€� Banerjee said. In the absence of itemised bill charting out the money collected against each channel, industry observers felt the 8 per cent tax was a notional amount.

â€œWhen the tax was introduced, scrupulous operators mentioned it in the bill and collected 8 per cent of the billed amount. Those who had avoided the issue altogether, are now seeking a hike following a drive by the tax authorities,â€� she said.

Service tax department inspectors have been visiting control rooms and checking the accounts of cable operators. Those who have defaulted are being penalised 300 per cent of the arrears.

â€œNearly 40 per cent cable operators donâ€™t issue receipts to customers. They naturally donâ€™t submit the tax either. With the department now launching a drive, they can do little but cough up,â€� a control room operator said.

With average collections in Kolkata pegged at Rs 30.6 crore a month (the Rs 170 average tariff for 17 lakh cable TV points), the service tax should amount to Rs 2.5 crore a month. However, with service tax collection at half the amount, the department has launched a drive to plug the holes.

7,LU to adopt 50-50 admission policy,"LUCKNOW: Admissions to under-graduate and post-graduate courses of Lucknow University will be made on a ""fifty-fifty"" formula. Out of a total of 100 marks, 50 per cent will be drawn from the entrance examination and the aggregate obtained by the candidate in the qualifying examination will determine the remaining 50.

The change in admission policy was agreed upon in principle in a meeting of Lucknow University authorities with students union representatives on Thursday. At present, admissions to undergraduate courses are made taking into account marks secured in 10+2 examination. For PG courses, the graduation marks are considered. The students union was demanding re-introduction of the entrance examination system.

However, it was decided that admission to law courses would be made purely on the basis of entrance test. LU Pro vice-chancellor Prof MP Singh told TNN that the official announcement would be made later.

Significantly, soon after the meeting, some student leaders announced that they would not accept anything less than a ''total'' entrance examinations for admissions. They said that in prominent universities of the country and in professional examinations entrance examination system was being followed. Till 2000 all admissions to LU were through entrance examinations. However, the practice was scrapped following largescale anomalies in admissions. Some student leaders, in connivance with non-teaching staff, used to manipulate admission results. These student leaders also used to ensure admissions for their supporters by making a ""solver"" sit in the test along with the candidate. Both the solver and the candidate used to submit their forms together and with the help of the non-teaching staff they were allotted roll numbers in serial.

After adopting the merit system of admissions, LU witnessed ""good quality"" intake of students.

As per the record of the last three years, general candidates with marks between 60 and 80 per cent marks in intermediate got admission to arts, science and commerce under-graduate courses. ""The most important factor was that that ""rowdy elements"" were filtered out in the process,"" said a teacher adding that now a candidate even with a poor 40 per cent would be able to gain admission after beating the entrance test.

8,City's pollscape to go lively with nominations,"PUNE: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Rajya Sabha member Suresh Kalmadi and Ashok Mohol will jointly file their nominations for the Lok Sabha seats from Baramati, Pune and Khed, respectively, on Friday afternoon.

The trio, in order to send a strong message to party workers that Pawar and Kalmadi have buried their differences, will call on Pune district collector and returning officer Madhukar Kokate to file their nominations.

Another candidate to file his nomination on Friday afternoon would be former bureaucrat and independent Arun Bhatia. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)''s Pradeep Rawat would file his nomination on Monday. Congress city unit chief Mohan Joshi told TNN that party workers would not accompany the candidates nor would there be any procession.

However, soon after filing the nominations, Pawar, Kalmadi and Mohol will address a public rally at Blue Nile chowk, near Poona Club, in Pune camp around 1 pm.

Sources told TNN that the rally was earlier planned at the B.J. Medical College grounds. However, sensing that the ground rent â€” around Rs 2 lakh â€” would be accounted as ""expenses"" made by candidates, the venue was shifted to Blue Nile chowk.

Joshi claimed that the Congress has sought the required permissions from the PMC and the Pune police for the rally at the chowk,which will remain closed for traffic on Friday.

9,Midnight call heralds govt revamp of MSEB,"PUNE: In a surprise move, the state government on Thursday dissolved the board of the Maharashtra state electricity board (MSEB) and removed Ashok Basak from the post of chairman. Although the tenure of the board expired on March 31, the manner in which it was dissolved came as shock â€” not just to Basak, but also consumer organisations.

Interestingly, news about the reconstitution of the board was kept a secret even from Basak, and the MSEB website still carries his name as chairman. Besides Basak, MSEB technical member Avinash Shethji has also been sidelined. Both were informed at midnight that they would have to hand over charge as their services were no longer required. State energy minister Dilip Walse-Patil confirmed the development and added that the board was not dissolved, only ""reconstituted"" as its tenure had expired. ""We have not appointed a new chairman. Energy secretary Jayant Kawale will be the acting chairman. Technical member M.R. Ambure has been retained, while Vinayak Rao has been asked to take over charge as accounts member,"" the minister revealed.

He clarified that the government had not appointed the three non-government members as yet, and that it would take at least three months before these appointments are made.

11,Gawli arrested in decade-old extortion case,"MUMBAI: Barely 24 hours after filing his nomination for the Lok Sabha seat in Mumbai South-Central constituency, local resident don Arun Gawli was on Friday arrested by the Agripada police in a long-forgotten extortion case of 1992.

He was, however, released as he had already secured anticipatory bail in 1994 for the samecase.

Police alleged that Gawliâ€™s henchmen had threatened a builder at Dagdi Chawl, the donâ€™s fortress in Byculla, and demanded Rs 5 lakh from him in 1992. The Agripada police had then arrested a few Gawli gangsters. But Gawli himself, the prime accused, was then lodged in Nashik jail.

â€œSince we could not arrest Gawli, the case was shown as pending and the chargesheets were not filed in the Mazagaon metropolitan court,â€™â€™ said additional police commissioner Surendra Pandey. Gawli must now appear before the Mazgaon court, where police will file chargesheets on Monday.

Afurious Gawli, accompanied by over 200 supporters of the Akhil Bharatiya Sena at the police station, blamed his rivals for â€œscuttling his plans to contest the electionsâ€™â€™.

He later said the police were being â€œmisusedâ€™â€™ by the Nationalist Congress Party, which holds the home portfolio.

He attacked his rival candidate and nephew, Sachin Ahir, who is contesting from Mumbai South-Central on an NCP ticket.

â€œI had helped Ahir win the assembly elections in 1999. But unfortunately, he has stabbed me in the back. He is making sure I am unable to contest the elections,â€™â€™ he said. Ahir was unavailable for comment.

Said Pandey, â€œSince the extortion case was pending against Gawli and he was aware of it, it is to be verified whether he has declared this to the election commission.â€™â€™

13,Pawar time-out may affect party,"MUMBAI: The Congress-Nationalist Congress Party election campaign, which was launched with much fanfare, has suffered a serious setback with NCP president and star campaigner Sharad Pawar announcing that he will take a break from campaigning because health reasons.

Although NCP spokesperson Vasant Chavan told TNN that Pawarâ€™s absence would not be felt much, since he has â€œworked out the election strategy in detail and it now for the party leaders and workers to implement it properly to ensure victoryâ€™â€™, a senior NCP leader articulated the sentiment in the party when he said, â€œIt like fighting a battle without a general.â€™â€™

Pawar will be admitted to Breach Candy hospital to undergo minor surgery on Saturday. After suffering from throat pain while touring Marathwada on March 29, he cancelled scheduled meetings in Hingoli and Nagpur.

He postponed his surgery in order to attend his first-ever rally with Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Solapur on Thursday. After filing his nomination papers for the Lok Sabha election from Baramati and drawing up fresh plans to reschedule campaigning in the state, he returned to Mumbai.

Pawar, who took the initiative in hammering out a pre-poll alliance with the Congress Party and RPI factions, will be missed keenly by the Congress-NCP candidates who are contesting 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra.

A senior Congress leader said that even Sonia Gandhi had begun to rely on Pawar for finalising candidates and chalking out election strategy in Maharashtra after he had had one-to one talks in Delhi.

Pawar is interested in holding region-wise meetings of Congress-NCP workers for better campaign coordination.
