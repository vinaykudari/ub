1,JPC puts cola ball in govt court,"NEW DELHI: The Joint Parliamentary Committee on soft drinks recommended that the Centre frames its own science-based food standards, in keeping with internationally-acceptable norms, to protect public health.

""Consumers have been paying for the end product, so why are cola firms insistent on setting norms just for ingredients? The ball is now in the court of the government,"" said JPC member Sanjay Nirupam:

In the process, the JPC has vindicated the NGO, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), which blew the whistle on pesticide residues in bottled water and soft drinks from the Coke and Pepsi stable.

Five months after the dirt hit the ceiling, the CSE said the JPC had made the issue of public health central to public policy.

""Now that we have an agenda on pesticide, water and soft drink regulation, it will be a challenge to take that forward,"" said CSE director Sunita Narain.

The best thing cola firms can do in their own interest of reassuring consumers is ""to stop fighting us on stringent standards"". Coke and Pepsi may have looked for the white flag but put up a brave face, maintaining their products were safe.

The government has been told to set up one organisation which could enforce and monitor drinking water norms and put in place an integrated food law.

In fact, the food laws must apply to water, something which should have been done long back. The JPC chaired by Sharad Pawar even talked of a mandatory food recall system, with companies made accountable for selling sub-standard and harmful products.

Drawing a distinction between global firms expected to show the road to better food safety and smaller fruit juice and beverage manufacturers, the committee said these need to be treated differently â€” out of an original health ministry draft putting them on par.

With millions of fruit and vegetable farmers providing the base, pesticide residues here are described as an issue of agricultural practices, not manufacture.

3,House disorder over law and order,"LUCKNOW: The budget session of the UP assembly began on a stormy note here on Wednesday with BSP members disrupting governor Vishnukant Shastri''s address to the joint sitting of both the Houses in protest against the prevailing law and order situation which they described as the ""worst"" in the state.

The reference to the recent incidents in which Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s grand nephew was killed in Mathura and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav''s nephew was kidnapped in Etawah were cited by the BSP, which also staged an angry walkout from the House over the issue.

In the face of mounting protest, the governor had to beat a hasty retreat, after reading the first and the last paragraph of his written speech running over 23 pages.

The House came to witness a noisy scene, as soon as the governor began to read his speech soon after his arrival at 11 am. The governor had hardly read a few lines when BSP members rose to hoot him down. They also displayed banners and placards with slogans, ""One who can not protect his family can not protect the people of the state"" in an obvious reference to the above mentioned incidents. As a result, the governor left the House within two minutes after his customary speech.

In his prepared text, the governor squarely blamed the previous Mayawati''s regime for turning the state into a laboratory of loot and corruption and disintegrating the administrative set-up.

However, during its five-month rule, the governor said the government had been able to re-establish ''democratic and human values''. As for the Ayodhya dispute, he said the government was of the firm view that the court decision should be awaited, and appealed to people to maintain communal harmony at all cost for the prosperity and happiness of the state.

As soon as the House assembled after the joint sitting, BSP members were again up on their feat shouting anti-government slogans for its alleged failure on the law and order front.

Angry BSP members staged a noisy walkout after their plea to raise the issue was not allowed by Speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi.

The House, after taking up the governor''s address and other legislative business, was adjourned for the day.

The budget speech also contains announcement for setting up of a UP State Road Authority with a view to ensuring proper maintenance of 9100 kms of state highways, their upgradation and smooth traffic flow on them. Besides bridge constructions across major rivers, the speech also promises the construction of flyovers over railway crossings. Apart from this, 16 programmes have also been announced for the rural development with an emphasis on potable water, clean toilets, construction of drains, link roads, Indira Awas and allocating surplus agricultural land to landless. In view of the precarious financial situation, the budget speech underlines the need for curtailing wasteful expenditure and increasing additional resources by way of plugging the tax evasion.

4,Patil protests against govt. 'discrimination',"MUMBAI: The Democratic Front (DF) government in Maharashtra has decided to confront the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre.

Stateâ€™s home minister R.R. Patil will stage a dharna at Azad Maidan on Wednesday as a part of the â€˜atmasanman abhiyanâ€™ (selfrespect campaign) launched by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to protest against the Central governmentâ€™s alleged discrimination against the state while allotting funds.

Patil, who also heads the state unit of the NCP, is unhappy with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who has announced only Rs 40 crore towards drought relief while addressing a meeting at Pandharpur recently. The state government had demanded Rs 1,712 crore and 10 lakhs tonnes of grains to tide over the drought situation.

However, the Centre has so far given only two lakh tonnes of grains. In fact, Mr Patil wanted the state government to return Rs 40 crore to the Centre, but chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde disagreed with him.

Patil will be staging a dharna while the rest of the cabinet will be in Delhi on Wednesday to plead with the Union government for more aid. The campaign will culminate in a rally, to be held at Ahmednagar, on February 16, which will be addressed by NCP president Sharad Pawar.

The NCP is apparently planning to whip up resent ment against the NDA government in the run up to the elections.

5,"Don’t chicken out, says govt","KOLKATA: Consumption of chicken and eggs has reduced drastically in the state following the bird flu scare, hurtling the industry into a crisis. A large number of poultry farmers met state animal resources minister Anisur Rahman on Wednesday. The minister, in turn, urged people not to panic and continue eating both.

""We have lost 60 per cent of our business in the live chicken segment,"" claimed Arambagh Hatcheries vice-president Partha Sen.

Though the dressed chicken segment has not been hit yet, the trend has set alarm bells ringing. ""People do not realise that we procure all our birds from within the state and there is no scope of this virus being detected here,"" Sen said.

The price of eggs in the wholesale market has gone down by as much as 50 paise per egg. According to Madan Mohan Maity, chairman of National Egg Co-Ordination Committee, West Bengal, eggs are now selling for Rs 1.32 per piece as against Rs 1.82 even a week ago. The price of live birds has also come down to Rs 30 per kg, claimed Ballygunge-based poultry farm owner Indranath Mukherjee.

Animal resources secretary Subesh Das assured that a meeting of state representatives with Central officials in New Delhi had come to the conclusion that there was little chance of the disease spreading in India.

""The disease in Pakistan has been caused by a virus which is of very low virulence and it is not capable of transmitting to India,"" he said. Corroborating the findings, University of Animal Sciences principal S.S. Ghosh claimed that physical factors for spreading the disease was absent in the country.

""India has never been on the transmission route of the virus in the past 20 years due to lack of physical factors like heavy storms and dry winds. This disease is not new but our country has never been affected,"" he added.

The minister also claimed that the death of over 100 chicks in Purulia was due to cold.

""After receiving the news, we conducted a detailed inquiry and found that the birds had not been not kept in a proper environment. A postmortem on the chicks revealed nothing wrong,"" he said, adding that Pakistan did not have the virus that can transmit to humans.

""Our state has been on an alert since the disease broke out in parts of Asia and we do not foresee any trouble with this,"" Subesh Das claimed.

Travel firm to pay for lax service The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has launched a drive against the sale of cut chicken pieces in major markets. A team of KMC veterinarians conducted surprise raids on New Market, College Street Market, Srimani Market, Manicktala Market and Ultadanga Market and seized nearly 80 kgs of meat over the past two days. The corporation had earlier threatened the chicken sellers not to sell cut pieces. The KMC has also sent notices to sellers of packaged chicken to display a board declaring that the meat is safe and hygienic in view of the bird flu scare.

7,LIC eyes schools as policy goldmines,"HYDERABAD: The next time you go to the PTA meeting at your bratâ€™s school, donâ€™t be startled if the teacher smiles and asks you if you have, er, made â€˜arrangementsâ€™ in case something, um, unfortunate were to happen to you.

Sheâ€™s likely just trying to sell you insurance. Under an aggressive new programme called Bima Schools, the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) is looking at schools to market its plans for the child segment such as Komal Jeevan and Jeevan Kishore.

The corporation sees the PTA, the Sports Day and such like school events as opportunities for marketing its products to parents, particularly child-related policies. ""There is a significant potential in the segment,â€™â€™ said LIC Hyderabad zonal manager L K Dash. ""We are finding the results positive.""

Schools participating in this programme will stand to earn rewards rangingfrom Rs 2,500 to Rs 10,000 depending on the number of policies they sell. If they sell 25 child-related policies, theyâ€™ll get the status of Bima School. The commission can be used by the school to buy any equipment of its choice.

""Schools are ideal places to create awareness among parents about child-related policies. The returns through such policies are structured to support the education of a child at various levels. This would hold great interest for parents with young children,"" Dash said.

So far, LIC has recognised 26 institutions as Bima Schools in its South Central zone â€” which covers Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. ""Our target is to take the number to 250 in the next two months in this zone,"" Dash said. The Bima Schools programme is akin to LICâ€™s village initiative, Bima Grams, under which it targeted villages with a population of 1,000-5,000.

8,Poll panel asks state to cut down on election costs,"KOLKATA: The Election Commission has sent a note to the state government asking it to drastically reduce the cost involved in organising the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.

As a measure, they have suggested not to set up more than one counting centre in any district and use minimum security staff.

This, according to the state government, is not possible as the size of the districts are much bigger than that in several other states. ""In some of our districts, there are three to four Lok Sabha constituencies. Having one centre in such cases will not be possible,"" said chief election officer (CEO) Basudeb Banerjee.

The CEO met the chief secretary and the home secretary on Tuesday to talk about the commissionâ€™s instructions. Banerjee will go to New Delhi on Wednesday to attend a meeting of all the CEOs.

The commission directive says a centralised counting centre will not only reduce the cost of setting up different centres but the counting process too will be smooth and error-free. The directive also says security arrangement costs too will reduce in this process.

Moreover, there is a shortage of electronic voting machines. ""We will require about 10,000 EVMs more than what we have at the moment. The requisition will have to be sent to the Election Commission immediately,"" said a departmental official.

The Election Commission is revising the votersâ€™ list as a an inquiry has revealed an increase in the electoral roll in some parts of the state are not factual. ""Many of these additions have been cancelled and a new list is being prepared. After completion the list will be sent to Election Commission for approval, and the commission will then release the new updated list,"" said a senior official.

The CEO decided to scrutinise the list after finding a phenomenal increase in the electoral roll in four areas.

According to Puta general secretary Amar Nath Singh, the executive will draw the attention of the VC towards the delay in notification regarding merit promotion of teachers (promoted after July 27, 1998) and pay fixation of teachers absorbed under the 18 months' and 24 months' absorption statutes.

10,Creamy layer income limit up at Rs 2.5 lakh,"NEW DELHI: The OBC elite has reason to rejoice. In a pre-election decision on Wednesday night, the Union cabinet raised the income limit for determining the ""creamy layer"" (socially advanced) among OBCs to Rs 2.5 lakh from the existing Rs 1 lakh.

Now, the more politically and economically powerful OBC communities like the Yadavs, Kurmis and Jaats will continue to corner the benefits of the 27 per cent reservation in direct recru-itment to the civil services.

The decision follows the recommendations of the National Commission for Backward Classes, which had the task of considering the issue of modification of the income criteria.

Apart from recommending an increase in the income limit, the commission suggested that the task of future periodic revision of the income criteria be taken up every three years or earlier, if the situation so demanded.

In 1992, the Supreme Court had upheld 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in Central services but excluded the socially advanced sections in them and directed the government to specify the requisite socio-economic criteria to make such exclusions.

Following the judgment, the government appointed an expert committee and a review committee to consider the issue. Subsequently, with the approval of the PM, the issue was entrusted with the commission.

11,Parties play SYL card before polls,"BATHINDA: It is the election time. And the time of playing the old ''trusted'' cards for the political parties to play on the emotions of people and bashing the opponents.

When the politicians in Punjab have competitive compulsions to rake SYL issue to make it an easy tool to excite the imagination and arose the primal fears of farmers, in the election time, after a lull of several months, the Punjab government has raised the SYL issue to browbeat the Akalis and its alliance government at the Centre before the Akalis backlash the party in the election campaigning.

After giving a call for â€œall-party meetingâ€� on the SYL issue, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh alleged here on Thursday that there was a â€œdeep-rooted conspiracyâ€� for keeping the Eradi Tribunal functioning in ''hibernationâ€™ for about 17 years.

The tribunal did nothing to resolve the issue since January 1987 when it gave its interim report about the allocation of the river waters between Haryana and Punjab, said Amarinder.

And now when Punjab has no surplus river for Haryana and the ground situation has changed entirely in the last over one and half decade, there was no logic of relying on the tribunal whose term of the reference to settle the dispute was irrelevant now, said Amarinder, talking to media persons here on Thursday.

I fail to understand why such a high-powered tribunal supposed to decide a water dispute... would be permitted to just sit idle for 17 years and why the Central Government... has not bestowed any attention for the proper functioning of such tribunal. There was a deep-rooted conspiracy in it, said Amarinder.

The water-sharing agreements signed more than 25 years ago should be reviewed in the present context as at that time there was plenty of water in the rivers flowing through Punjab. He added that with the passage of time, water flowing in canals in Punjab had reduced.

Fresh survey should be conducted to ascertain quantity of water in various canals in Punjab and Haryana, he said. He said Haryana, with its share from the Yamuna, has more water than Punjab I am hopeful of support of leaders of all political parties in the state on the SYL issue and after a meeting of all party leaders on Saturday, we are expecting to meet Prime Minister the next week to convey our point of view, said Amarinder. He said that if the Haryana government was still adamant on getting more share in river waters, a new commission should be constituted with new term of references.

The Punjab government call of all-party meeting has however, caught the Akalis in a very piquant situation. Talking to TNN, a senior Akali leader said, the call of the meeting was a pre-empt move by the Congress in the state so that Akalis could not bash the Congress on the contentious issue in run-up to the election as the for Congress and Akalis in Punjab and all political parties in Haryana, the contentious SYL Canal is the whipping boy to blame others for the water imbroglio in the region.

12,"With an eye on polls, RMC shelves taxes","RAJKOT: With Lok Sabha polls round the corner, sentiments of the public at large seem to be the focus of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC)''s Thursday standing committee meeting.

To start with, the ruling Congress promptly rejected Rs 11.50 crore new tax proposals forwarded by the municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar.

Standing Committee Chairman Indranil Rajguru told newsmen after the standing committee met that although the Rs 8 crore hike in water tax proposed by the commissioner was justified, it was put off .

""Release of excess water from Bhadar dam by the state government was forcing the RMC to instead buy Narmada water at exorbitant costs,"" he said.

Apart from setting aside parking charge and the new water harvesting charge, the standing committee had also rejected the increase of Rs one crore in taxes for streetlight, he further informed.

The RMC meeting, instead, focused more on the new infrastructure and amusement facilities in the city. These include an underpass or a fly over on the Gondal Road, a demand which was hanging fire for a long time now.

An amount of Rs 4.5 crore has been earmarked for the purpose, the construction for which would begin only after an expert''s opinion.

Besides, another Rs one crore has been sanctioned for a swimming pool and a gymnasium on Kalawad Road and another Rs 25 lakh for a swimming pool on the eastern part of the city.

Also, an equal amount has been sanctioned for an exclusive health centre for ladies and Rs 10 lakh sanctioned for an open-air theatre. In addition to all this, for the road resurfacing the Congress has earmarked Rs 18.65 crore.

Over 20 per cent of total income of corporation would be utilised for water supply in the city, said Rajguru, adding that the RMC has also decided to replace old halogens with the new ones to conserve energy. A total of Rs 80 lakh has been reserved for the upgrade of streetlights in city.

Further, the RMC will construct a new garden on the Kalawad Road along with renovation of the existing ones in city.

Another Rs 10.40 crore has been sanctioned for the repairs of the buildings and dams damaged in the earthquake while Rs five crore has been put aside for a new filter plant at Nayari dam site.

The civic body has also decided to construct a octroi yard on the lines of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to check octroi theft. A sum of Rs 50 lakh has been allocated for the purpose.

13,Villagers up in arms against govt apathy,"AHMEDABAD: Residents of five villages of Viramgam taluka of Ahmedabad district are up in arms against the government apathy towards losses suffered by them during the monsoon last year.

They have planned a protest rally at Kamdar Maidan in Viramgam on Thursday.

On August 24, 2003, incessant rainfall had damaged houses and property causing heavy losses.

Compelled to take shelter in open fields for days together, residents have tried time and again to draw attention of the Gujarat government, but there has been no response.

A total of 430 families staying in five villages---Moti Kumad, Sakaria, Sokli, Abhesingpura and Vasan---were left homeless. Not only that, the government is yet to make any effort to rehabilitate the affected families. Most victims of this natural disaster are daily wagers with no financial resources to fall back on.

After waiting for several months, the aggrieved villagers recently filed a special civil application (number 18027 of 2003) in the High Court.

The main issue raised in the petition is inaction of the government in providing relief and rehabilitation. After this petition, the High Court issued notices to the chief secretary of the Gujarat government, relief commissioner, chairperson of the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA) and collector of Ahmedabad.

These officials will have to reply to the charges levelled against them by villagers of Viramgam.
