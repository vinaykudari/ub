1,"Mann extols terrorists, offers six-month tax-free govt","bathinda: simranjeet singh mann of panthic morcha has announced that his party would provide six-month ''tax-free government'' if voted to power. making the foamy promise at a party rally here on monday, the radical akali leader said that his party was committed to provide free water and electricity and having no sales tax, income-tax, house tax or any other tax for the first six months if it formed the next government. ''as it seems a far-fetched idea, to make it viable, the amount to run the government for the six-month period would be recovered from the wealth amassed by badal and amarinder families by sucking blood of the state's people, mann said. next on his oration list were the ''militant brothers who saved punjab water from being diverted to haryana and rajasthan''. ''as parkash singh badal is working in cahoots with congress leaders to divert punjab waters to haryana and rajasthan, it were the militants who torpedoed the plan and preserved the water in the state at the cost of their lives,'' he said. he charged the punjab chief minister with getting rs 2 crore from the then haryana chief minister devi lal in 1978, for facilitating a survey about the possibility of syl canal construction. mann outrightly rejected rajiv-longowal accord on river waters. he rued that the sad-bjp government had engaged a tehsil-level advocate to contest its case on the syl in the supreme court. he said all activists of the shiv sena, bajrang dal, rss and vhp, who were getting arms training to terrorise minorities in the country, should be pushed into pakistan to show bravery and sabotage terrorists' camps. ''and all expenses on the coffins of these martyrs would be borne by the panthic morcha,'' he said, ridiculing the coffin scam.

2,Furniture manufacturing unit inconveniences neighbours,"dhramsala: the furnituremanufacturing unit being run at viveknagar, una, on the left side of the malati road, is creating nuisance for the local residents because of the tremendous noise generated by it. the residents are so fed-up with the ceaseless noise of planers and hammers that they have repeatedly brought the matter to the notice of the district administration, but no action has been initiated. even though the 200 metre area on the left side of the road has been marked as residential-cum-commercial, the owner of the furniture unit got a residential plan approved from the municipal council, but is now operating a furniture unit there.the industries department issued a noc to set-up the unit without verifying with the mc if the piece of land was meant for commercial purposes. similarly, the punjab national bank, una, approved a loan, under a small scale industries scheme, for the unit, without going into details of whether the unit could be set-up in land marked for residential purposes. not only this, the district pollution control department went a step ahead and issued the unit owner a negligible pollution certificate to start the furniture unit. the prime culprit has been the municipal council, which, despite knowing that the construction on the said piece of land was not in accordance with the approved design, took no action at all. r k sharma, a doctor, said that due to the noise from the furniture unit, neither could the children study nor the old sleep peacefully. the owner of the furniture unit, chaman lal, said the land was ancestral and he had the right to carry out any business he wished. he denied that the noise levels were uncomfortable for the neighbours. a k mahajan, district town-planning officer, said his department was concerned only with the basic planning of the area and not the construction plan. pnb bank manager mahesh kapoor said the loan was approved after going through with all the necessary formalities. baldev singh, general manager of the district industries department, said the noc was issued as the area was notified as partly residential-cumcommercial. it was up to the mc to raise objections, he said. s k dhiman, assistant environment engineer, district pollution department, said the negligible pollution certificate had been issued by his predecessor as the furniture unit did not fall in the pollutionemitting category. mc executive officer tarsem singh jaswal admitted that the furniture unit owner had flouted the rules. he said a notice had been issued to close down the unit and action would be taken soon. even deputy commissioner kamlesh pant confirmed that a notice for closing the unit had been issued and if the owner did not comply, strict action would be initiated against him.

3,How free and fair are elections?,"chandigarh:since the days of t n seshan as the chief election commissioner, the election commission goes into overdrive when polls near, and its constant refrain is ''we will ensure a free and fair election.'' the tools used to attain this goal include routine transfer of bureaucrats and virtual assumption of bureaucracy by the ec, imposition of a poll code of conduct for politicians which entails various restrictions and the posting of election observers from other states to the state where polling is to be held. the efficacy of all the three measures is doubtful. for instance, in punjab, the chief electoral officer (ceo), acting on behalf of the ec, has effected numerous transfers of officials. most of these transfers have been on grounds of overstaying in a particular post for more than four years. however, in a large number of cases, these officials have nothing to do with election duty. officials from different offices of puda, transport and other departments have been sent packing, but that is the legitimate function and responsibility of the state government. ''we can't let an official against whom there are six complaints be given a 'good' post,'' additional ceo usha sharma said when asked about the transfer of a civil servant who is not associated with any poll-related duty. this raises uncomfortable questions. is the ec the lawful authority to decide which civil servant will be posted where? its mandate is to ensure free and fair elections and, to that extent, it can transfer any official it feels is not neutral. but it cannot pick and choose: that is for an elected government to decide. also, even if the ec decides to transfer civil servants for its stated purpose, there is little it can do to control matters at the polling booth level which are manned by junior officials such as teachers, agricultural inspectors and the like who are from the district cadre. in fact, these people are far more potent tools of canvassing and ensuring imbalance in any election and they cannot be transferred as poll officials outside a given district. if these officials cannot be handled — and their loyalties are important — what is the purpose of transferring, say, a deputy commissioner or an sdm who are not likely candidates for canvassing! ''these transfers have a deterrent effect and send a signal down the line,'' is how the additional ceo sees it. there is a serious questionmark over what an election observer from outside the state can do except send a report if there is booth capturing, something that almost unheard of in punjab? in fact, the more insidious forms of electoral violations like low reporting of election expenditure and surreptitious transfers of money to influence voting pattern are very difficult to check. more so because each election observer has to handle at least three to four assembly constituencies.

5,Studies reveal high incidence of child sexual abuse,"mumbai: emerging evidence from india points to a disturbing culture of silence over violence and abuse of children. the studies also show that sexual abuse is more common than previously imagined, that young boys are as vulnerable as the girl child, and schools - like homes - are not a haven of safety. unless society begins to address this situation, young people will be condemned to a future ridden with psychological damage and behavioural problems, researchers who conducted two recent surveys on the subject told tnn. one of the first studies looking at the incidence of abuse among adolescents at schools was published in a recent issue of the national medical journal of india by vikram patel and gracey andrew. conducted by the goa-based sangath society, the survey covered 811 adolescents studying in class xi of eight higher secondary schools in urban and rural goa. the second study, covering 733 students in the 12-19 age group from two high schools and a college in ahmedabad, was conducted by the department of psychiatry, b.j. medical college and civil hospital, ahmedabad. this study, examined the incidence of depression and its linkage with child abuse. findings of both these studies were corroborated by a literature review conducted recently by who consultant and health researcher shireen jejeebhoy. the goa study reveals that a third of adolescents covered by the study had experienced some form of sexual abuse. in the words of these adolescents, sexual abuse constitutes ""any sexual experience that is forced on the individual against their wishes, such as someone talking about sex in a manner that makes you uncomfortable, forcible touching of your body parts, or someone purposely brushing their private parts against you"". the study also found that six per cent of students had experienced `coercive sexual intercourse' (anal, vaginal or oral). the statistics revealed that boys and girls were equally vulnerable to abuse, with the commonest perpetrators being older students or friends (48 per cent); parents or relatives (eight per cent) and teachers (four per cent). a large category (27 per cent) were `miscellaneous'. while common perpetrators for boys were older students or friends (73 per cent), for girls they came in the `miscellaneous' category (48 per cent), primarily strangers who brushed their private parts against them or touched them in crowded public places such as buses. a key and worrying finding was that boys from rural schools were more likely than boys in urban schools to have experienced coercive sexual intercourse, while girls from urban schools had a higher risk of sexual abuse than girls in rural schools. shockingly, the commonest response to abuse was to do nothing. says mr patel, ""the most startling finding of our study is not only that sexual abusive experiences were more common than we had expected, but also that boys were just as frequently the victims of forcible sexual intercourse as girls. campaigns to raise awareness are essential and applies specially to boys. our study shows that unlike girls, boys never discuss their experience of abuse with family or friends."" the ahmedabad study reveals that physical abuse was found in six per cent, sexual abuse in 10 per cent and emotional abuse in 26 per cent of the students. these studies, as well as ms jejeebhoy's literature review of sexual coercion, point to the adverse physical and mental health consequences on adolescents who suffer sexual abuse. adolescents who had been abused demonstrated poor examination scores, had a strained relationship with their parents (especially girls), suffered from depression and suicidal behaviour, and were vulnerable to substance abuse and gambling. they were also more likely to engage in high risk consensual sexual intercourse, and suffer other behavioural problems as adults. adolescents who had experienced sexual abuse were also much more likely to have experienced verbal and physical abuse. ms jejeebhoy's review highlights some cultural perceptions encouraging young men to believe that sexual urges are uncontrollable and coercion is a sign of masculinity, thus placing women at increased risk. another such perception is that rape is justifiable on women who flaunt themselves, lead partners on or give mixed messages. meanwhile, several studies point to the inability of young men in approaching girls and communicating about intimate matters, thus leading to coercive behaviour. the absence of a supportive and non-judgmental environment towards sexual health needs of young people is a major concern emerging from the studies. the researchers stress that while adults, including health practitioners, need to be sensitised on how to recognise and deal with child abuse, children themselves should develop self-confidence and skills to protect themselves against unwanted sexual touch or coercion. school counselling services are also required.

6,`Model by-laws for cooperative housing societies can be amended',"mumbai: even as the debate over the force of law of the model by-laws for cooperative housing societies issued last year continues, the authorities have indicated that they are open to amending certain provisions. commissioner for cooperation and registrar of cooperative societies ratnakar gaikwad told the times news network that the adoption of the model by-laws was mandatory for cooperative housing societies but added that there was ""no rigidity"" in the by-laws and that his office would consider amendments if there was a consensus on the issue. however, any society adopting the model by- laws had to do so in toto as they stand today, he said. although mr gaikwad said his office had already issued circulars asking societies to adopt the by-laws, there has been few takers so far. a mere 600 of the 9,907 registered societies in the western suburbs have adopted the model by-laws, according to mahendra kalyankar, district deputy registrar cooperative societies, western suburbs. however, no official action has been taken so far against the societies which have not adopted them. on the other hand, lawyers specialising in cooperative housing matters said the by-laws did not have the force of law. advocate vinod sampat said that before the adoption of the new by-laws became mandatory, a notification to that effect had to be issued by the government. advocate yusuf mulani said many cooperative housings societies were willing to embrace the by-laws, but without three particular provisions which, they felt, eroded the powers of management committees. they are those relating to non-occupancy charges, a cap of rs 25,000 on transfer fee (at present, many committees charge huge unauthorised amounts as transfer fee during the resale of flats) and the clause which does away with the committee's no- objection certificate while admitting a new member. former director-general of police k.p. medhekar said the denial of the right to management committees to issue nocs for flat transfers would mean that there would be no checks on the entry of unwanted or antisocial elements. he was speaking at a seminar on `the management of cooperative housing societies' organised jointly by the indian institute of public administration, all-india institute of local self-government and the mumbai district cooperative housing federation on saturday. delivering the inaugural address at the seminar, state chief secretary v. ranganathan said management committees should carry out annual inspections of the physical condition of their buildings although such guidelines were not incorporated in the by-laws. he also said societies should weigh the option of reconstructing instead of repairing buildings over 50 years old.

9,Transco steps up demand for meters in farm sector,"hyderabad: even as the transmission corporation of andhra pradesh (ap transco) is exploring ways to curb excessive transmission and distribution losses (t&d), the demand for installation of meters for agricultural connections to ascertain the actual consumption by farm sector in the state is getting more emphatic. the world bank, which is financing the power sector restructuring process in the state, had earlier suggested universal metering in the power sector. ap transco engineers association has now taken up the demand for meters for farm connections. it may be recalled that the ap electricity regulatory commission in its previous tariff order had directed the corporation to complete installation of meters by march 2003. interestingly, both the bank as well as the engineers association are stressing the need for installation of meters as non-metering of power supplied to farm sector is giving an incentive to the utility (the transco in this case) to push all system losses on to the agricultural consumers. in its report on power supply to agriculture: andhra pradesh, a case study,'' the world bank said that the difficulties of metering a state as large as andhra pradesh, with almost two million agricultural consumers, are enormous. however, lack of metering provides an incentive to utilities to camouflage non-technical losses (i.e. theft) under the estimated consumption by agricultural consumers,'' the bank said. echoing similar views, ap transco engineers association general secretary c s r sarma said the energy purchased by transco from different sources is measured with 0.2 per cent accuracy, while that sold to metered consumers like domestic, commercial and industrial categories are also accurately measured and billed for. the difference between these two consist of agricultural consumption and losses. if the agricultural consumption is projected high, the figure of losses naturally comes down,'' he said. according to available figures, this was precisely what was done till 1996 when losses were pegged down to around 18 to 19 per cent while the consumption by agricultural sector was shown to be high. however, consequent to the introduction of the comprehensive energy audit system, the losses shot up to 38 to 39 per cent, showing up the deficiencies in the system.

10,NCP fails to get landslide victory in Baramati polls,"pune: the national congress party (ncp) has failed to get a landslide victory in the baramati municipal council elections. the party won 18 seats out of the 24. the remaining seven seats were wrested by the baramati shahar vikas aghadi. given the fact that baramati happens to be the bastion of maratha strongman sharad pawar, even the loss of seven seats surely is a cause of worry for the ncp, which fought the polls under the party banner for the first time. another setback for the ncp was the victory of sunil pote, a staunch rival of state irrigation minister ajit pawar, by a comfortable margin on the ticket of baramati vikas aghadi. pote, a former council president, has been striking a discordant note againt ajit pawar ever since the minister engineered a no-confidence motion against him last year. the no-confidence motion had in fact triggered off a by-poll in the baramati civic council. but the silver lining for the ncp was the victory of its candidate sandhya bobde by a thumping majority of 5,000 votes. the president's post had been reserved for a scheduled caste woman. meanwhile, counting of votes at six other municipal councils in pune district was proceeding slowly on monday, with independents and local parties leading. elections in baramati, jejuri, alandi, saswad, indapur, shirur and daund talukas were held on sunday amid high voter turnout. almost all the areas recorded about 70 per cent of voting with jejuri recording the highest of 85 per cent. in jejuri, there were no recognised parties fighting the elections to 17 seats. all the aspirants were independents. the council president's post was won by jagannath dilip barbhai. in alandi too, 17 seats were at stake. surprisingly, the shiv sena could win only one seat even as the shahar vikas aghadi, formed by local leaders, won seven seats. the sant dyaneshwar vikas aghadi also won seven seats.an independent claimed the last seat. parvatrao kurhade of the shahar vikas aghadi was elected president of the alandi council. in saswad, counting was going on very slowly as results of only 10 of the 17 wards had been declared till evening. chandrakant jagtap of the saswad shahar vikas aghadi was a leading contender for the president's post. similarly counting for shirur, daund and indapur was not over at the time of going to the press.

11,"MPs sore at Nepal police, Union govt","saharsa: the external affairs ministryâ€™s silence on complaints of alleged highhandedness of the nepalese police at indo-nepal border has irked the mps from bihar who continue to suffer â€œhumiliationâ€� while crossing the nepal territory to reach their destination in india. for the janata dal(u) mp from saharsa, dinesh chandra yadav, the problem is acute as nirmali and marauna blocks under supaul district, though parts of his parliamentary constituency, have become somewhat inaccessible for him. to reach these far-flung koshi-ravaged areas, he has to cross at least seven districts of north bihar if he opts to travel by train, a tiresome and time-taking journey indeed. if he undertakes a road journey which is more convenient and time-saving, he has to face embarrassing problems as he has to cross the border. in august 2001, seven lok sabha members from bihar â€” namely ramjiwan singh, devendra prasad yadav, and dinesh chandra yadav (all jd-u), raghunath jha and renu kumari (samta party), sukhdeo paswan (rjd) and rajesh ranjan alias pappu yadav (independent) had submitted a joint memorandum to external affairs minister jaswant singh, in which they had raised objection to certain restrictions imposed by the nepal government along the indo-nepal border, which, according to them, are not only irrelevant but also cause undue humiliation to the indian citizens. according to the memorandum, whereas the nepalese citizens enjoy the privilege of uninterrupted visit to india with their private vehicles (with nepalese registration numbers), the indian people have to suffer intimidation at the hands of nepalese police. the indian mps have to face humiliation when their bodyguards are not allowed to carry their arms and are forced to leave their vips unprotected. local mp dinesh chandra yadav has expressed concern over the indifference of the external affairs ministry and requested jaswant singh to take suitable steps. to avert such unpleaseant situations along the indo-nepal border.

12,Mayor not allowed to work: minister,"kolkata: the mayor may be an enthusiastic man, but his political colleagues do not have the city's interest at heart - state municipal affairs minister asok bhattacharya made this damning accusation on monday. he alleged that the trinamul congress-bjp led calcutta municipal corporation had remained practically non-functional since it assumed power. the minister was reacting to a recent resolution passed by the cpm calcutta district committee, which accused the civic board of neglecting development work. the minister felt that the main reason for lack of development work was poor co-ordination between trinamul leaders and those holding cmc posts. one or two leaders in the cmc may be genuinely interested in development, but the political leaders are creating problems for them, he said. the minister elaborated that during his meetings with subrata mukherjee, he had felt that the mayor was truly keen on development, but he was scuttled by his party almost every time, bhattacharya said. the minister cited the example of the recent difference of opinion over formation of ward committees. initially, the cmc board did not want to form ward committees. if this had been done about a year and a half back, a lot of development work might have gone ahead by now, bhattacharya said. mukherjee, predictably, pooh-poohed the minister's allegations. these are political statements. however, he admitted to having had differences with his party on two issues, eviction along the banks of the tolly's nullah and hawker eviction. the mayor, instead, charged the previous cmc boards of the past 15 years for the mess in the civic body. the administration is in a mess. they have recruited people indiscriminately, with the result that today we have around 3,500 excess staff, mukherjee said. he, in turn, blamed the state government organisations for the tardy pace of projects. most of the work done by the kolkata metropolitan development authority and the kolkata metropolitan water and sanitation authority have been poorly planned and implemented, mukherjee said. he defended the cmc administration, saying a lot was in the pipeline. we are working with a five-year plan. it is true that a lot of work is left, but once these are complete, i think we will be able to give the minister a lesson or two in civic management, he said. mukherjee denied that any difference of opinion with party leaders was hampering development work. in the past two years, i have had a differences with my party. this is nothing major compared to the thousands of other decisions that we have agreed upon, he said.

16,We will win civic polls: CM,"hyderabad: chief minister n chandrababu naidu on monday said that the telugu desam party was confident that the developmental activities it had undertaken would help it win the elections to the municipal corporation of hyderabad as well as rajahmundry. he said the main fight in hyderabad was between the mim and the tdp. he said the mim was opposed to development and accused them of rigging elections. he claimed that there were booths where 90 percent votes were polled and this situation prevailed as the congress had run away from the old city leaving the field open. he said for the past six years, it was only the tdp which has been trying to change the situation. he said the party cadre had been put on a high alert and they would resist any attempt by the mim to rig the polls. reacting sharply to a question on allegations of money being distributed by the tdp to voters, he said there are 850 slums in the city and 27 lakh voters. ""do you think it is possible for anyone to distribute money. it is a baseless allegation,"" he said. unlike other parties the tdp has refrained from targeting individuals, he said. ""i have utilised the elections to educate people about the developmental activities taken up by me in the last six years,"" he said. he said he was of the firm opinion that there has been change in people's thinking. he, however, clarified that when he criticised the mim being anti-development, he did not mean that muslims were against development. ""i referred to the mim as a party and not the muslim community,"" he said. during the past six years, he said, he had visited the old city 40 times and whatever development was visible was due to his continued efforts. about rs 80 crore had been spent on laying of roads, central lighting, road dividers and other infrastructural activities, he said.

19,Saffron roadshow has UP elections in mind,"lucknow: dubbing the sant chetavani yatra as a well-meaning attempt to unite the fragmented hindu society, specially during the election time when different political parties were trying to drive a wedge in the name of caste and creed, the vishwa hindu parishad president ashok singhal on monday gave a clear indication of how the much-hyped saffron roadshow was basically aimed at wooing the hindu vote bank in the coming state assembly elections by whipping up a mass hindutva hysteria. singhal was addressing the virat dharma sabha on the laxman mela ground, which, judging by its attendance, could only evoke a lukewarm response in the state capital. elaborating, he said that while the muslim and the christian communities were recognised as global superpowers, a much-splintered hindu community did not enjoy similar status. the ram janmbhoomi movement, he said, had provided it with a much-needed platform to shelve their differences, join hands and work towards a united, prosperous and powerful community. the movement, he said, was aimed at earning back the lost self-esteem of the majority community people in india who were fed up of being treated as secondary citizens in their motherland. reiterating the vhp stand to begin construction of the ram temple in march, singhal demanded that the disputed land be handed over to shri ram janmbhoomi nyas, which was its rightful owner. the sanction accorded to carry out the shilanyas itself was a proof of the ownership title, he claimed. addressing the crowd, swami chinmanand floated a demand for a faster mode of disposing of the long-standing rjb dispute. the legal process, he declared, was taking far too long a time and needed to be replaced. the alternatives that he suggested included setting up a joint parliamentary committee to probe the issue and also an examination by experts of the archaeological evidence found at the site. taking a dig at the opposition leaders, specially sonia gandhi, he said that despite being approached to settle the dispute she had shown a marked inclination to scuttle the issue indefinitely. the delay has only led to strengthening the hands of terrorist and anti-national forces. others who addressed the crowd amidst chants of jai shri ram included swami paramnand, swami vasudevanand maharaj, shankarcharya bhanupithadhish and international general secratary of vhp pravin bhai togadia.

28,Karnataka to unveil e-governance policy,"bangalore: the karnataka government's flagship -- information technology -- received a boost on monday with governor v.s. ramadevi announcing that an e-governance policy will be unveiled shortly. addressing the joint session of the karnataka legislature here, ramadevi said the e-governance policy could play a crucial role in improving the quality of governance. she lauded the it department for playing an important role in assisting various departments in implementing it projects. in her 70-minute address in kannada, the governor recapitulated various programmes undertaken by the government last year, touched upon the proposed ones and drew attention to the financial position of the state. ``my government will pursue various schemes and projects which will promote dynamic growth and development. however, in view of the prevailing economic conditions, it would be necessary to tighten our belts in order to achieve our development and reform goals,'' she stated. ramadevi pointed out that in state's development, the government cannot rely solely on its own resources. hence, during 2001-2002, 17 externally aided projects were implemented covering health services, urban infrastructure, industries, irrigation, rural and urban water supply schemes. the first tranche of loan for the karnataka economic restructuring programmes amounting to rs 705.58 crore had come. referring to the drought spell in july-august, ramadevi said the centre failed to release additional funds despite a memorandum seeking rs 903 crore submitted. the situation was overcome with the state government releasing rs 103 crore from its own resources. ramadevi said the cii partnership summit held in bangalore recently focused on the strengths of karnataka in various sectors and targeted investments from both within and outside the state. the presence of british prime minister tony blair made this summit ``a resounding success''. for the speedy trial of some sensitive cases, the high court had been moved to set up special courts. these courts would deal with fake stamp paper, church blast, kambalapalli and dandupalya gang cases. on the education front, the university's functioning had been streamlined with the karnataka state universities act. the act provides for universities in karnataka to have an interface with foreign ones. the government was committed to the e-four policy -- education, employment, empowerment and entrepreneurship. also the tribals' welfare was being looked into with chief minister s.m. krishna and his senior colleagues visiting their areas.

29,HC serves notice on GHS principal,"allahabad: allahabad high court, on a writ of quo warranto filed by six teachers and staff members of girls high school (ghs) and college here, issued notices to cv innes, principal, and committee of management ghs and college, here and has directed court's registry to list this case in the last week of february. justice v m sahai passed the order on the teachers' petition. aggrieved teachers have prayed that the high court issue a writ of quo warranto writ, calling upon c v innes, to show the authority by which he is holding the principal's office at the ghs and and college, allahabad. the teachers have also prayed seeking mandamus from the court to restrain innes from acting as principal of ghs and college. the teachers, namely ms r saunders, ms s daniel, ms s simon, ms r lartius, m l chaurasia and ms r arial, have said that c v innes is simultaneously working as principal of three institutions, namely, bhs, st john's academy, naini, allahabad and the ghs. the teachers have submitted that a person cannot be a teacher or principal of three colleges, in as much as principal is whole time employee of the college. a person cannot be a whole time principal simultaneously in three colleges. it is obvious that while making the appointment of innes as principal of the institution (ghs), all rules, regulations, procedures and norms were given a complete go by. relying upon a supreme court decision, in unikrishnan case, the petitioners have said that principal's office, even in a private institution, is public office. private institutions discharge state functions of imparting education and therefore, such institutions are state agencies. by holding such office, the principal is squandering huge funds of the college and indulging in the act of misapropriation and criminal breach of trust. innes being an usurper of public office, is not entitled to hold it, alleged the teachers in the court. besides, the petitioners have stated that the principal does not even possess the minimum qualifications prescribed for appointment. as such his tenure is illegal and void.

30,Refresher courses for govt school science teachers,"new delhi: science teachers of delhi government-run schools may soon be going back to college. under a model proposed by the delhi state council for educational research and training, teachers will receive hands-on training in the subjects they are least comfortable with. this, the scert says, may boost the dismal pass percentage in the 1,000-odd government schools. according to the scert, students are not entirely to blame for the poor performance. there are systemic failures as well. the most crucial failing of school teachers is that they are ill-equipped to teach in higher classes, particularly science. many teachers lose touch with their subjects and are unable to handle adolescents, the scert said. the project, the first of its kind in the country, would utilise the infrastructure available in the 28 colleges run by the government. ''the model proposes six weeks' hands-on training for teachers in physics, chemistry or biology laboratories,'' said scert director janaki rajan. the first step, said rajan, would be to sort the teachers into three batches — physics, chemistry or biology graduates. the teachers would then be sent to laboratories of subjects they lack the exposure in. college teachers would act as resource persons. but why send a physics graduate to a biology lab? the problem, it seems, started a decade back when the national council for educational research and training (ncert) introduced integrated science in class 10, in place of physics, chemistry and biology. ''since it was one subject, a government school could hire one corresponding teacher,'' rajan said. consequently, teachers who had majored in any one of the subjects had to teach all three. the proposed model seeks to overcome this problem. it may even be modified to get over a similar ''integrated social science'' problem that the new ncert syllabi proposes. here too, a history teacher would be required to teach geography and economics and vice-versa. take the instance of a senior science teacher at a government school in rajouri garden. having done her b sc in zoology, botany and chemistry, she floundered when asked to teach physics. ''i found it difficult to solve numericals. even now my heart is not into physics,'' she admitted. ''most teachers have learnt the subject only till class 10 or 12. the training module may help upgrade their knowledge,'' she added. d p kaur, vice-principal of government girls senior secondary school in gummanhera also welcomes the proposal. ''it will help teachers clear their doubts and develop their interest,'' she said. interestingly, a large set of teachers in government schools have come from the municipal corporation of delhi, through a system of equivalence. the system has recently been scrapped by the lt-governor. ''teacher educators tend to be isolated from the latest developments in the field. colleges, on the other hand, go along with the latest happenings,'' rajan added. more than 500 teachers from the mcd used to join the directorate every year through a system of equivalence. most of these teachers have acquired a ba degree, five years' teaching experience in mcd schools and a diet diploma, which makes them equivalent to a trained graduate teacher. reasoning that most of these teachers were ill-trained to handle higher classes, the equivalence system has now been scrapped by the lt governor.

33,`BJP inciting passions with Chetavani Yatra',"lucknow: upping its ante against the ruling bjp combine, the samajwadi party (sp) on tuesday charged the bjp of being hand in glove with the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) in trying to incite religious passions to garner votes. criticising the vhp for taking out the chetavani yatra in its run-up to the assembly polls, sp leader ahmad hasan accused the bjp of tacitly giving the green signal to the yatra, which, he said, would stoke communal passions in the state. ""in any case, the election commission should take cognizance of the yatra, since it is aimed at influencing the voters on religious lines,"" he added. this yatra could have been taken out after the elections, said sp state vice-president bhagwati prasad. but with most issues failing to enthuse the electorate, the bjp was trying to trumpet the ram mandir issue once again, he said. the sp leaders, however, chuckled at the lukewarm response to the yatra and claimed that the bjp had run out of tricks. with an exasperated bjp trying all tricks up its sleeves, singh said, free and fair polls were impossible in the state. welcoming monday's decision of the supreme court on the mbc qouta in providing new jobs, hasan said that this only proved their contention that the move was to appease a section of voters and was taken in a hurry. ""our stand is vindicated by the apex court decision,"" hasan said and added that rajnath singh was merely trying to hoodwink voters and deflect their attention from his abject failure in governance in the last five years. the party also charged the bjp, the chief minister in particular, of shielding criminals. he said that permission sought from the election commission to set free convicted persons involved in the sensational maya tyagi case was a blatant example of this government-criminal nexus.

""the silence,"" he added ""was resulting in serious doubts in the minds of the christian community about their well-being and the secular credentials of the leaders."" the candidature of dara singh and his interviews as shown in the media in which he justified the killing of the staines in orissa, dayal added, was like rubbing salt to their wounds. what is appalling is the complete silence of national parties on the issue, the council leaders alleged. ""it is revolting to see a murderer like dara singh plunge into electoral politics,"" dayal added. terming the candidature a political obscenity, the council has also decided to write a letter to chief election commissioner to prevent dara singh from contesting the elections. asked whether this would not set a dangerous precedent, dayal said though it was technically not possible to prevent anyone from contesting polls, he wished that the prime minister and other leaders publicly denounced the candidature which was mocking at and throwing a challenge to the secular credentials of the country. what if such a condemnation was not forthcoming? dayal told the times news network that in such an eventuality the christian community would explore all options, which included `voter education', to educate the community on whom to vote for. ""we are a peace-loving community and would, therefore, use all intellectual weapons in our armoury to expose such nefarious designs aimed at fragmenting our social structure,"" he added. the council also aired its disgust at the way the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh was dishing out anti-minority statements in states like rajasthan, up, jharkhand and madhya pradesh. ""all this will have to stop if the minorities are to be sent a message that they are safe."" but wasn't the silence of senior leaders a rebuff enough to people like dara? ""no"", said dayal and added that there would have to be serious and clear signals from the government in this regard. related stories:

35,Centre plans cess to help those in organic farming,"pune: as part of moves to ameliorate farmers dependent on organic cultivation, the centre is considering levying one per cent cess on chemical fertilisers and pesticides, besides providing them with a single-window solution on export-related services. talking to newspersons here on monday, minister of state for finance balasaheb vikhe patil said the funds collected through the cess would be utilised to help traditional agriculturists cope with the changes in farming techniques, increase the use of bio-fertilisers and create the infrastructure to certify their produce as organically grown. vikhe patil said the krishi vigyan kendras operating in different parts of the country could be entrusted with the job of certification. he said, ''all agencies such as banks, agriculture development promotion bodies, central and state governments and export authorities would hold periodical meetings with agro- exporters and issue various permissions in one sitting.'' further, in order to make india's agriculture exports more competitive in view of the world trade organisation agreement coming into force next year, the centre will follow a focused policy to develop agro-climatic zones, he said. sixteen major and 44 minor agro- climatic export zones have been identified as suitable for cultivation of different commodities, fruits and vegetables. with a view to providing financial support for an all-round development of these zones as export pockets, the centre will divert some of the subsidies, currently given to the agriculture sector, towards them. if proper earmarking is done, each zone would require rs 1,000 crore, he indicated. the exim bank of india will act as the nodal agency for the entire export development of agricultural produce, he added. earlier, inaugurating a two-day seminar on ''exports of agricultural products: prospects and challenges'', jointly hosted by the exim bank of india and the bank of maharashtra, vikhe patil expressed concern over the decline in agri-exports in the last decade. to address this situation and prepare for the post-wto challenges, the farm sector should adopt product-specific research activities, improved technology and reduce costs to be competitive in the global market. ''we should also strive to achieve high standards in packaging, labelling and product promotion.''
