0,City government files glowing self appraisal,"new delhi: if one goes by the performance appraisals of the city government ministers, delhi would probably be the most well-governed state in the country. the 27-page report submitted by chief minister sheila dikshit to aicc president sonia gandhi last week suggests that her government has hardly erred or faltered in the last two-and-half its been in power. the report also says the government's transport and industry departments coped well during the cng crisis and the relocation of polluting industries, respectively. dikshit submitted this detailed report at the congress chief ministers' conference held last week. it's based on the appraisals submitted by the six cabinet ministers last month. according to dikshit, the ministers were asked to list out the problems and challenges facing their department. ``i had told my ministers to be forthright in giving details about their departmental achievements and problems. the idea behind the whole exercise was to get an overall picture of the government's performance. i think the ministers' reports give a genuine account of our performance since 1998,'' she said. the report lists out the government's functions in 15 different heads, mainly power, transport, health, water, environment and forest, social welfare, good governance, public distribution system, rural governance, perspective planning, and legislative initiatives. under each head, the ministers concerned have given their department's performance, substantiating it with adequate data and the deadlines for specific tasks. for instance, the report says that in the last two years, the government built 10 flyovers and two bridges, while another 13 were in progress and 26 more were in the pipeline. the issues of industrial relocation and conversion of city buses to cng as per the supreme court's order have got special mention. similarly, the government's action plan for cleaning the yamuna by 2003 has been listed as a challenge. while mentioning practical problems the government faces, the report says multiplicity of authorities is the biggest hindrance in carrying out development work in the state.
