0,Grievances section of govt website launched,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state government on Thursday launched its public grievances section â€” http://delhionline.nic.in â€” on its official website.

Residents can now lodge their complaint against civic bodies â€” Delhi Vidyut Board, Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Municipal Corporation, the public works department, urban development, social welfare and health department â€” and check the progress within 24 hours. The site will allow people to interact online with the chief minister''s office.

Similarly the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), too, is planning to launch an ""absolutely consumer friendly"" website. The agency claims consumers will be able to avail forms online for obtaining water, sewage and bio-gas connection, file tenders, read public notices and news updates.

But whether it will be of any real use remains to be seen as websites of its predecessors â€” the Delhi state government and the Delhi Municipal Corporation â€” are hardly promising. Already, the launch of DJB''s website has been postponed twice due to chief minister Sheila Dikshit''s hectic schedule.

Most of the websites of other civic agencies have become dormant. For example, MCD''s website cannot be accessed easily and it still shows names of the former mayor, councillors and officials. Public interface is least, as the opinion page is in the making and the news section was last updated in September 2000.

Similarly, the Delhi state government website which was launched two years back is rarely updated. Delhi state government principal secretary S Reghunathan said: ""Since our website is not updated, we barely receive an e-mail a day."" He said the trend toward e-governance has failed to take off as officials do not use the website regularly. ""The main objective of such websites is defeated,"" he said.

In the Delhi state government website, it is difficult to access the citizens'' charter page. Similar is the problem with downloading of sales tax forms, the link does not open. Though the MCD website has provision for filing property tax online, not even 100 of the one million-plus tax payers have used it.

1,"Rane, Munde dare DF govt","MUMBAI: Close on the heels of the Thursdayâ€™s vote of confidence, the Congress-led Democratic Front government seemed set for another round of confrontation with the saffron combine with senior Shiv Sena leader Narayan Rane and key BJP leader Gopinath Munde daring the state government to arrest them in connection with the alleged abduction of Congress MLA Padmakar Valvi last week.

Mr Valvi, who spent five days at Matoshree health club near Jogeshwari during the high political drama, has filed a FIR against Mr Rane, Mr Munde, Sena MLA Bala Nandgaonkar and 50 others for his forcible abduction.

A cognisable offence has been registered, it is learnt.Talking to journalists after the trust vote, Mr Munde said that additional commissioner of police Surinder Kumar had called him up prior to the trust vote informing him of his impending arrest.

â€œThe DFâ€™s gameplan was to arrest me before the trust vote.

If the state government goes to the extent of putting me behind bars the whole of Maharashtra would be up in flames. I will not ask for bail in case I am arrested,â€™â€™

Mr Munde said later while addressing a crowd of restive Shiv Sainiks and BJP activists outside Mr Raneâ€™s official residence near Mantralay.

Addressing a press conference at his residence, deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, however, denied that there was a move to arrest Mr Munde following Mr Valviâ€™s complaint. â€œMr Munde is a big liar.

He is a bigger liar than Pakistan. His claim that a senior police official had called him up to inform him about his arrest is nothing but untruth,â€™â€™ Mr Bhujbal said.

Earlier, Mr Rane ridiculed the possibility of his arrest in view of Mr Valviâ€™s written undertaking to the governor last week that he (Mr Valvi) had left the Congress Party of his own volition.

â€œMr Valvi canâ€™t change his statement now,â€™â€™ the Sena leader pointed out.

Mr Walvi has alleged in his complaint that he was kidnapped by Shiv Sena-BJP workers and was illegally detained at Matoshree club in Jogeshwari. He claimed that he had escaped from the club premises.

LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawati has directed the transferred officers and employees to immediately take charge at their new place of posting.

She has asked the concerning officers to immediately relieve the transferred officers. She was meeting the ministers and legislators for the first time after taking over here on Thursday.

More than 90 legislators of different political parties apprised the chief minister of the various problems of their respective constituencies. She urged the legislators to take interest in development of their areas instead of transfer and posting and extend their cooperation in maintaining quality and timely completion of developmental works.

Referring to demands of the legislators relating to sanctioning of new schemes, financial assistance, medical facilities, road construction, electrification, construction of school buildings, drinking water and setting up of power sub-stations, the chief minister said that at present the government was passing through financial difficulties and that a huge amount was being paid to purchase power.

Mayawati assured the legislators that all possible efforts were being made for improving the financial condition of the state. Following demand by some legislators to cancel transfer of district-level officers, she said that the transfers were being effected as per transfer policy and there was no possibility of discrimination with any officer.

She said that efforts would be made to remove economic disparity and regional imbalances. She urged the legislators to solve peopleâ€™s problems at local level and extend cooperation in creating atmosphere of peace in the state.",LUCKNOW
3,BJP scared of facing polls: Rawal,"GANDHINAGAR: Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Naresh Rawal on Thursday alleged that the state government had postponed elections to 88 municipalities and two district panchayats as the BJP was certain about its defeat in the elections.

Speaking to mediapersons, Rawal said BJP had lost almost all by-elections and gram panchayat elections in the last three years and the BJP leadership was scared that voters would reject them again.

""Chief Minister Narendra Modi who whipped up the Hindu card has also realised that the magic of Hindutva will not work and the BJP stood exposed due to his gimmicks"".

Rawal accused the BJP of doublespeak saying on one hand the government had postponed the civic body polls while on the other the Governor had stated that the situation in the state was normal and Assembly elections could be held earlier.

""Former chief minister Keshubhai Patel''s statement at Visavadar that he had relinquished the post voluntarily and could snatch it again speaks volumes of what is going on"", he said.

He added that BJP legislators were annoyed with Modi''s functioning and his inept handling of the communal riots.

Referring to the controversy over a meeting of relief camp organisers to discuss their problems, Rawal clarified he had requested concerned officials to remain present, as Congress members of the state relief committee wished to solve grievances of refugees living in the camps.

""As members of the committee constituted by the Governor, it is our duty to focus the government''s attention towards problems of riot victims"", he said.

He added that he would write to the Prime Minister on the administration''s apathy and neglect of victims needs.

Rawal scoffed at the Rs 40,000-crore 9th Five-Year Plan formulated by the Modi government and termed it as ''far from ground reality''.

4,"No English please, we’re the govt","HYDERABAD: Overruling demands from various quarters, especially parents, the state government has as a matter of policy decided not to introduce English as a medium of instruction in government schools, minister for school education Mandava Venkateswara Rao said on Thursday.

Speaking to Times News Network, the minister said the government would instead focus its attention on strengthening teaching of English as a subject in all government schools.

From the ensuing academic session, the government would ensure that there was no shortage of English teachers. All vacancies would be filled with qualified teachers, he said.

Venkateswara Rao said several many parental groups have lobbied for English as a medium of instruction in government schools, arguing that it would help pupils compete better with alumni of private English-medium schools.

Such a move would also attract middle class families into enroling their children in government schools, thereby improving the standards overall.

But the minister felt to the contrary. Sudden introduction of English as a medium of instruction may actually mar, not improve, standards as the existing staff was not equipped to teach in English.

The government also feels that it may be a politically incorrect move as introducing English medium instruction may be seen as running counter to its policy of promoting Telugu.

But since the importance of English cannot be denied, the government felt greater emphasis might be given to improving the quality of teaching the language as a subject rather than introducing it as a medium of instruction.

Feigning ignorance about the resolution passed by the Guntur Municipal Corporation to introduce English medium in two of its schools on a trial basis, Venkateswara Rao said local bodies should not deviate from the stateâ€™s policy.

5,DF govt survives no-confidence vote,"MUMBAI: In an anti-climax to the 10-day political crisis, which included kidnapping, charges of bribery and shepherding of MLAs out of the state, the Democratic Front DF) government led by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh won the vote of confidence with a margin of 10 votes on Thursday.In a 288-member House the DF bagged 143 votes, the opposition 133, seven were disqualified and five members of the PWP abstained from voting.Governor P.C. Alexander had asked the coalition government to prove its majority on the floor of the House when the opposition Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party alliance paraded eight defector MLAs before him and claimed that the ruling coalition had lost its majority.Deshmukh said, It is a victory of democracy and reflects the high traditions of Maharastra. It is now clear that no one can buy legislators to topple a government.We have emerged stronger after the trial of strength.Leader of the opposition Narayan Rane and BJP leader Gopinath Munde candidly accepted their defeat and squarely blamed assembly speaker Arun Gujarathi for saving the government by disqualifying seven MLAs who had withdrawn support to the government.But the chief minister pointed out that even if these seven MLAs were not disqualified, his government would have won by a majority of three votes.Before the speaker entered the assembly exactly at 11 am, he delivered his judgement in the eight cases brought before him under the anti-defection law. He reserved his ruling on Congress MLA Padmakar Valvi, who returned to the Congress fold under dramatic circumstances on Wednesday.Gujarathi did not allow any speeches and put the one-line resolution moved by minister for legislative affairs Rohidas Patil to vote. First he took a voice vote and followed this with a head count. The entire exercise took 20 minutes. Later in the day, the Bombay high court adjourned petitions filed by the seven defector MLAs challenging their disqualification by the speaker.The main grounds of contention were that the impugned order was unreasonable and unconstitutional and that they were not given a fair opportunity to reply to the show-cause notices.The matter will be taken up next Thursday. The petitions were filed by Shirishkumar Kotwal, Gangaram Thakkarwad, Narayan Pawar, Shivaji Naik, Narsing Patil, Vinay Kore and Desmond Yates.The MLAs argued that they were denied the mandatory seven days to file their replies and contended that the speaker had no jurisdiction to even issue the summons.They argued that their letter to the governor cannot be construed to mean withdrawal of membership of their respective parties.

6,Carry papers or risk arrest,"KOLKATA: Chauffeurs will henceforth be required to carry authorisation from the owners attesting the name and the address of the drivers.

Police could also arrest any chauffeur found driving without such authorisation, declared DC (Traffic) M.K. Singh on Thursday.

This will be part of the drive against callous and drunken driving as well as crime and terrorism. Instructions had been issued to arrest people driving recklessly under the influence of alcohol and narcotics.

Offenders till now have got away by paying fines, Singh pointed out. But since fines failed to restrain reckless driving, traffic cops have now been asked to arrest the drivers, he said.

Arrangements have been made, he said, to receive fines from motorists at all branches of UCO and UBI in the city.

From June 17, Kyd Street will be thrown open to both-way traffic.

For vehicles made after 1994, seat-belts would become mandatory for the driver and the front-seat occupant from August 15.

For older vehicles, this rule is not applicable. But the DC urged people to fit all vehicles with seat-belts for their own security.

7,Court attaches govt guesthouse,"RAJAHMUNDRY: The senior civil judge court at Rajahmundry attached the properties of irrigation department guesthouse and the jeep of the executive engineer of the head works of Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage on Thursday.

The court attached the property after the irrigation officials failed to appear before it in connection with a tax case filed by the Dowleswaram panchayat. According to the panchayat sources, the irrigation department was served a notice to pay Rs 51,322 per year towards house tax for its guest house in 1996.

Though repeated adjournments were given, the irrigation officials failed to turn up to present their case resulting in the court appointing an ameena directing attachment of the guesthouse and the jeep.

However, the officer incharge, in the absence of the EE, reportedly produced sureties equivalent to the total amount due to the panchayat.

8,Narendra Modi hints at early polls in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: Even as Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the possibility of early elections in the state, it was learnt that Home Minister LK Advani will be visiting Ahmedabad this weekend to make his own assessment of the situation.

""The polls are due in March next year and can be held anytime before that,"" Modi told newspersons when asked when these would be held.

Meanwhile Modi''s chief objective in the wake of several months of communal violence in the state, in which his government has been indicted by the National Human Rights Commission for its ""comprehensive failure"", appears to be to reform madrasas.

On Thursday, he met External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and asked him to find out what reform programme Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia had introduced in their madrasas so these could be copied in Gujarat.

Narendra Modi, who met the press here for the first time since the violence in Gujarat refused to answer any questions on what his objective was in turning his attention to madrasas: ""I am still studying the subject.""

Asked whether he had come across any instances where madrasas had been misused, he referred to one such institution near Navsari where the police had discovered RDX and AK-47s.

Modi, who perhaps hoped for a friendly chat with newspersons, was taken aback at the barrage of questions on Gujarat, all of which he stonewalled. Asked to name reasons for the violence, he said, ""It is a subject of study for the whole country, especially sociologists and academics.""

Asked for his reading of the situation, he said: ""I don''t want to say anything that will influence the commission of enquiry.""

On the NHRC''s scathing criticism of his ministry: ""I have already sent my reply. It will not be proper on my part to comment on an institution of national importance."" Would it not have been better for him and all those named in the FIRs to have stepped down while the enquiry was on? ""There is no such tradition in the country that people being investigated should step down.""

Asked whether he was following the raj dharma that the PM had urged him to, Modi said, ""The PM said I was already following raj dharam."" He said he was in constant touch with the Prime Minister and continued to take his guidance on the Gujarat situation â€“ he met the PM in the evening.

During his meeting with Home Minister Advani, Modi urged the Centre to modernise the security arrangements along the Indo-Pak coastal and land border in the state and upgrade certain facilities: ""Coordination among various central agencies and central level monitoring of the situation were also discussed and Advani gave a positive response,"" he said.

9,"Court stays arrest of Akali MP, kins","FEROZEPUR: A local court on stayed the arrest of Akali Dal MP Zora Singh Mann, his brother and two sons in a land dispute case.

District and Sessions Judge M M S Bedi also issued interim directions that they will join the investigation and in case of their arrest, they will be released on interim bail on their furnishing personal bond of Rs 5000 each with a surety to the satisfaction of the investigating officer.

A case involving a land dispute was registered yesterday against Mann, his two sons - Vardev Singh and Nardev Singh - along with his brother Jagnandan Singh and a close relative Jaspal Singh.

Meanwhile, district police chief Praveen Kumar Sinha said Mann and his relatives were cooperating with the investigations.

According to an FIR lodged in Sadar Jalalabad police station, the complainant Shaminder Singh alleged that the MP along with his associates attacked him and his relatives while they were returning after informing the nearest police station that a few persons were allegedly trying to steal a motor from the land where already section 145 had been imposed by the local SDM following the land dispute.

As per Shaminder Singh, Jalalabad SDM had imposed section 145 on the disputed land measuring 31 canals and 18 marlas in village Chak Suhelewala to prevent any scuffle.

When contacted, Mann pleaded innocence and asserted that he was being made a target of a political conspiracy.

While accusing the present government of allegedly resorting to undemocratic means only to harass the Akalis, he brushed off the allegations of thrashing anybody and termed the charges as false and baseless.
