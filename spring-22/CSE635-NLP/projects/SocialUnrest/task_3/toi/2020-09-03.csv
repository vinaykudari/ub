0,Little activity before by elections,"HYDERABAD: There is an eerie silence. It remains to be seen whether it is a lull before the storm or a lack of enthusiasm among the political parties which are in the fray for the Karwan by elections scheduled to be held on September 26.

If the strategy of the Bharatiya Janata Party is any indication, the campaign will be a star studded one. The BJP would be launching its campaign on September 10 and it proposes to bring Shatrughan Sinha and Uma Bharati.

The Majlis-e ittehadul-Muslameen prefers to keep its cards close to its chest. ""We are confident of winning the polls, we do not have to resort to gimmicks,"" says MIM leader, Assaduddin Owaisi.

The MIM is pinning its hopes on Afsar Khan who is a business man and is considered to be popular among all sections of the people belonging to both the communities in the area. Baddam Bal Reddy, the BJP candidate had been an MLA till 1999 from this constituency and is considered to be a popular figure among the constituents.

The problem in the Congress party appears to be that of having too many aspirants. There are six people in the race and Amar Singh appears to be ahead of others according to party sources. Amar Singh had contested last time in 1999 and lost the election by 24,000 votes. Another keen aspirant who has been trying hard is Shoba Pande. Shoba is an SC candidate from Langar Houz area.

However, this time the entry of Telangana Rashtra Samiti had given a new twist to the scenario. The party had put up K Krishna Rao as its candidate. Krishna Rao is an one time confidante of Baddam Bal Reddy, the BJP contestant.

Meanwhile, no nomination had been filed on the second day after the process was set in motion on Tuesday. The candidates and parties appear to waiting for an auspicious time.

2,‘People have matured since the early ’80s’,"MUMBAI: The bylanes of Bhendi Bazaar present a picture of harmony in times of strife. Three Hindu tenants of the Phool Galli Masjid have installed Ganesh idols in their kholis abutting the mosque.

â€œOur Muslim neighbours even take turns to guard the idol at night,â€™â€™ says Mohan Radhakrishna, a cane basket weaver.

Further north, Dongri boasts around eight Sarvajanik Mandals. â€œA Muslim family has donated the trolley on which a tall Ganapati is perched,â€™â€™ says senior police inspector R.R. Naik.

â€œPeople have definitely matured from the days in the early â€˜80s when Ganapati processions passing through minority-dominated areas were booed and pelted,â€™â€™ notes a senior police officer.Concerted efforts of the police, social workers and mohalla commitees have helped patch things up.

â€œFrom Byculla to Chowpatty, Ganapati processions are now greeted by stalls set up by Muslim volunteers offering water, sharbat and firstaid,â€™â€™ says DCP Himanshu Roy.

Volunteers of Aman committee, Kaniza Fatima Trust, Shantata Committee and Nirbhay Bano even accompany the processions through the so-called â€˜troubleâ€™ areas. Saifee Ambulance Trust has its vehicles parked at Chowpatty to ferry the injured.

3,State govt defends housing plan for police,"MUMBAI: Despite strong suspicion of a builder-politician nexus in government circles, the state home department has defended its controversial housing scheme for policemen that involves participation of private developers. The department has also denied that anything is â€˜irregularâ€™ or ''scandalous'' about the scheme.

The plan, first reported by TNN on August 10, invites builders to construct free staff quarters for policemen on plots belonging to the Mumbai police department. As compensation, these builders would be allowed to utilise 40 per cent of the area of the plots for commercial exploitation.

Government officials said this is a clear violation because the existing development control rules permit only 15 per cent of the land to be used in such a fashion.

Highly placed government sources said a minister in the Democratic Front government is behind this â€˜dubiousâ€™ proposal, which they claim is meant to benefit the powerful buildersâ€™ lobby in the city. These sources further claimed that there were three meetings between this minister and some builders to chalk out this controversial scheme.

Despite eyebrows being raised in government circles, the home department has justified its proposal to give up to 40 per cent of police plots for commercial development to builders.

The department claimed that the 15 per cent commercial exploitation allowed under the development control rules is not sufficient to generate resources to meet the housing shortage. There are 40,000 men and officers in the Mumbai police but only half of them have government housing.

Justifying its intention to let builders use 40 per cent of police land, the home department said, â€œIf higher commercial use is permitted, necessary resources can be raised (for police housing) by leasing out part of the premises for commercial use.â€™â€™

The department also denied that prime police plots in Naigaon, Malabar Hill, Gamdevi, Lamington Road, Palton Road and Colaba will be used for commercial purposes. It also denied that existing police complexes will be taken up for redevelopment.

â€œOnly vacant plots earmarked for police housing are proposed to be developed under the new scheme. Special care is being taken to ensure that police operations are not in any way hampered by allowing commercial use of present and future police lands,â€™â€™ it said.

However, top government sources confirmed that there was indeed a plan to hand over prime police plots and complexes in south Mumbai worth hundreds of crores to builders for redevelopment under the guise of police housing. â€œAmong these is a large plot belonging to the police department near Worli seaface,â€™â€™ these sources said.

The BMC, it is learnt, has strongly objected to the sops that are being planned to be given to builders under this scheme.

4,Ex-minister Naseemuddin grilled by CBI again,"LUCKNOW: The Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) on Wednesday quizzed former minister for transport and excise Naseemuddin Siddiqui for the second time at the Newal Kishore Road regional office of the investigating agency.

The CBI team, probing into the multi-crore Taj Heritage Corridor (THC) scam, questioned the former minister on his role in ensuring that the contract was awarded to the National Project Construction Corporation (NPCC) allegedly because a key person in the corporation was close to him. This has surfaced as yet another charge against Naseemuddin which may compound the woes of the former minister.

Sources said that the CBI sought Naseemuddin''s personal appearance at the Newal Kishore Road office where he reached with a battery of six-odd lawyers along with Bahujan Samaj Party MLA Irshad Ahmad. As Siddiqui entered the premises, his lawyers were asked to wait outside while he was escorted to the room of the DIG Neeraj Nayan. The grilling, which began around 3 pm ended a little before 6 in the evening when a visibly subdued Naseemuddin walked out of the DIG''s room to join his lawyers and Irshad Ahmad, who were eagerly waiting outside.

Sources said that the CBI team put forward specific questions on how the construction work contract was handed over to the NPCC without formal tenders being floated and quotations for the minimum bid collected. The sleuths also grilled the former minister on the alleged favours extended by him to an influential person in NPCC.

It is alleged that it was because of this person that Siddiqui bypassed all norms to ensure that the contract was pocketed by the NPCC. CBI, sources said, was in know of reports that the NPCC contract came as a gift from Naseemuddin to his contact. The organisation to which the sub-contract for THC-related work was awarded also has some trusted aides of Siddiqui as major share-holders.

After grilling Siddiqui, the CBI team held a meeting with special finance secretary Lehri Yadav who helped the investigators in verifying the tampered documents related to the release of Rs 20 crore payment in the second instalment for THC which was later stopped by the chief secretary DS Bagga when it was about to be released from the treasury. Yadav also helped the CBI officials in deciphering the different notings on the file and the exact meaning of the words used. The CBI sources emphasised that Yadav was at the CBI office in capacity of a help and witness and not for his own quizzing.

5,"SOS to Jois: No govt, no governance","PATNA: The malfunctioning of the state government has annoyed the Patna High Court so much that it now has requested the governor to intervene and set things right, as there is â€œno governance and no governmentâ€� here.

â€œIt is becoming rampant in this state that there is no synchronisation and cooperation between secretaries of different departments. Even the secretaries do not know at what place they have the vacancies, so that a particular man may be posted and transferred,â€� says the court order passed by the single bench presided by Justice R S Garg.

â€œI must say and record my displeasure against the working of the state goverment in the secretariat...I fail to understand in what manner the government is being run,â€� the court added.

Justice Garg gave the order on Wednesday while hearing on a writ petition (CWJC No 6750 of 2003) relating to transfer and posting of circle officer (CO) Shyamanand Sharma.

â€œIt appears that the state is failing in its duties in every field and even in making the posting and transfer of the subordinate officers,â€� the court said. As ordered by the court, rural development secretary Gorelal Yadav and personnel secretary S R Asthana were present in the court. The matter would come up for hearing again after a month.

â€œWould it not be advisable for the state government and secretaries running the government to call for reports from different places before issuing the transfer orders, so that a person under transfer order joins at a place at a clear vacancy and is not required to report back to the departmental head, touch his feet and make a folded hand prayer that some posting orders may be issued in his favour,â€� stated the judge.

The judge said for past sometime, he had been observing that on the request of one minister to another, the transfer and posting orders are stayed or cancelled or recalled or fresh orders issued. â€œThe blue eyed baby of one minister is given posting at a particular place and the orphan in the service is being thrown to another place,â€� he said.

â€œA secretary/head of the department must understand the plight and peril of such an officer, who is being replaced, but is not being given any posting order,â€� the court order noted.

â€œOf late, I am seeing that a man is transferred to a place, but the replaced man is not given any order of posting, and if the order of his posting is given to him at the transferred post/place, he is not being allowed to join on the ground that there is no vacancy,â€� the order said.

6,Mumbai blasts not a fallout of Gujarat riots: BJP,"NEW DELHI: The BJP has objected to statements that the twin blasts in Mumbai were a fallout of the communal violence in Gujarat.

BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, ""The biggest problem is that a handful of terrorist organisations are influencing the Muslim community and bringing it a bad name"".

Saying that post 9/11, a suspicion has grown worldwide that a majority of Muslims are linked to terrorist outfits, he asked Muslims to launch a ''social campaign'' to counter the propaganda.

This was imperative, he said, since the ""Muslim community was regarded with suspicion. Even some Islamic countries are viewing with suspicion Muslims from India, Pakistan and Indonesia"".

7,State govt to move SC over medical seats,"PUNE: The state government on Wednesday said it will challenge the Bombay high court decision exempting unaided medical colleges from providing reservation for management quota seats.

The high court, while hearing the issue of medical admissions on Tuesday, exempted the managements of private medical colleges from implementing 50 per cent reservation. Following this, the state decided to file a review petition in the supreme court.

A senior government functionary said chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde and his deputy Chhagan Bhujbal have already approved a move to file the review petition.

According to the stand taken by the state government, the high court order amounts to a violation of the Constitution and contradicts an earlier apex court order.

While the supreme court fixed a 50-50 ratio for allocation of seats by the state and the college managements, the high court directives on Tuesday said only the state quota will have reservations.

The government finds this unacceptable as this would bring down the number of reservation seats.

The government, in its review petition, will request the supreme court to lay down effective guidelines in this regard so that private colleges do not take undue advantage of the freedom to allocate seats under the management quota.

Meanwhile, the state government increased the annual fee for medical education at government colleges from Rs 12,000 to Rs 18,000.

However, students studying in the newly set-up colleges at Akola, Kolhapur and Latur will have to pay Rs 40,000 yearly.

8,Principal secy to former CM shifted,"LUCKNOW: In one of the important decisions Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has shifted P L Punia from his post.

Till now Punia was principal secretary to the chief minister and a close associate of Mayawati.

It may be known that the other officials involved in the project - former secretary R K Sharma has already been suspended.

The CBI in it''s preliminary report had also raised objections on the role of chief secretary D S Bagga.

However, the role of Punia had attracted much criticism. Once the most powerful of bureaucrats in the state, Punia becomes director of the Uttar Pradesh Administrative and Management Institute.

13,Punjab changes policy on grants for rural areas,"PATIALA: The Punjab government has dropped ""pick and choose"" policy in distribution of grants for the development of rural areas.

First of all this new policy has been implemented in the home district of Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Earlier the governments had always been criticized by the opposition for distribution of funds only to the villages panchayats headed by the supporters of ruling party. Now all the panchayats would get development funds but the amount of money would be fixed on the basis of population of the village.

Besides, the village panchayats have been given the right of fixation the priority of their development projects. Earlier, the Block Development Officers (BDOs) were enjoying this power. This was made clear by Punjab Excise and Taxation minister Sardul Singh while presiding over the meting of District Development and Planning Board.

The minister on Thursday disclosed that an amount of Rs 19.81 crore would be spent for over all development of the district out of which Rs 11.80 crore had been earmarked for the development projects in 1080 village of the district as first installment of 25 per cent amount for each village. He also released the first installment of Rs 5.90 crore.

Interestingly, the representatives of the ruling party opposed the new scheme on the basis that they should be given right to decided the priority of beneficiary villages adding plea that the distribution of funds in installments would not be effective. The plea was ignored.

The minister snubbed some district officers for not submitting the Utilized Certificates of the amount earlier released for different development projects and other schemes. He warned them to submit these certificates immediately.

Vice Chairman of the District Planning Board Ravinder Singh Sandhu, Parliamentary Secretary Punjab directed all the SDMs and Block Development and Project Officers to form teams of senior officers to inspect the works done in rural areas in a stipulated period so that the government could know the use of grants and the standard of the works done.

On this occasion, Chairman of the District Planning Board, Punjab minister Sardul Singh also released a sum of Rs 5.28 crore for pensions given by the Department of Social Security. He disclosed that an amount of Rs. 1.82 crore would be spent for the welfare of Scheduled castes.

The minister said that the government had earmarked an amount of Rs 32 lakh to provide five marla''s plots to the homeless poor scheduled caste people. He directed the District Social Welfare Officer to identify the beneficiaries in the entire district within 15 days.

14,Adani Exports to get Rs 74 cr from sale of investments,"AHMEDABAD: Like the last fiscal year, Adani Exports Ltd is likely to derive a significant portion of its profits from the sale of investments in 2003-04 as well.

The only listed entity of the Adani Group will gain around Rs 74 crore from the sale of its 25 per cent odd stake in Adani Container (Mundra) Terminals to P&O Ports in a deal totalling $60 million.

Meanwhile, the Ahmedabad-based Adani Exports has infused Rs 30 crore in FY03 into its wholly owned Mauritius-based subsidiary, Adani Global Ltd, in order to expand its global outsourcing business, according to a senior official of the Adani group.

The Adanis had sold their 100 per cent stake - owned by different group companies - in the container terminal for a consideration of $60 million (about Rs 290 crore). It excluded a $135-million deal for additional infrastructure belonging to the Gujarat Adani Port.

As per the deal, two container berths and the container yard have been taken over by P&O Ports for $195 million, with an option for two more berths after crossing the eight-lakh twenty-foot container units (TEUs) target in six years. The two berths, having a quay-length of 630 metres, have a capacity of 1.25 million TEUs.

During FY03, in a complex deal, Adani Exports got Rs 44.2 crore from P&O Ports by selling part of its holding in Adani Port Ltd for Rs 34.5 crore and Rs 9.7 crore through partial sale of its stake in Gujarat Adani Port Ltd.

Interestingly, in FY03, while the net profit was Rs 88.33 crore, the other income component was Rs 61 crore, coming largely from sale of investments.

In fiscal 2003-04, with Rs 74 crore coming from the sale of the container terminal stake, Adani Exports is expected to again derive a significant portion of its net profit from sale of investments.

An Adani official said being the flagship company of the group, Adani Exports has invested in various projects taken up by the group. So, booking partial or full profits in these projects becomes a recurring other income source.

During FY03, Adani Exports expanded the share capital of its Mauritius subsidiary to Rs 30.9 crore from Rs 1.5 crore. Adani Global has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Adani Global FZE at Dubai and Adani Global Pte Ltd at Singapore.

""The higher investments have been made to substantially expand its trading business in South East Asia, Middle East and Europe,"" said the Adani official.

A note in the company''s FY03 annual report says that the Department of Company Affairs has noticed certain irregularities during its inspection. Adani Exports has filed compounding applications, which are pending before the department.

15,Haryana Local Area Development Tax Act to be amended,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana cabinet on Thursday approved the Excise and Taxation Department''s proposal to amend Local Area Development Tax Act.

Revealing this, an official spokesman said that the amendment was necessary in the light of the fact that some refineries outside the state were enjoying sales tax concessions and selling petroleum products to bulk and other users in the state at a lower rate of sales tax.

This was adversely affecting domestic trade and industry, which was either manufacturing or dealing in these goods, said the spokesman adding that with a view to having a level playing field in case of these goods, it was necessary to raise the limit to tax rate from the present 10 per cent to 20 per cent by amending the Act.

He further explained that a number of goods, brought or received in a local area for use, didnot lose their identity when used, like furnishings, office equipment and air conditioners, but these were shown as part of closing stock and as such remained free of levy of tax.

It was felt necessary to charge tax on these goods and tax the import of such plants and equipment which were not used in the manufacturing or processing of goods, he added.

The amendment would yield a revenue of Rs 10 crore in the first year and of Rs one crore annually.

The cabinet also approved the drafts of Bills namely Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of Unregulated Development(Haryana amendment) Bill,2003 and the Punjab New Capital(Periphery) Control(Haryana Amendment) Bill, 2003 to be introduced in the coming Assembly session commencing on Tuesday.

These legislations will enable the government to identify the areas needed for ""genuine village expansion"" through district administration and field officers and can be exempted from the provisions of these Acts through notification subject to the condition that these extended areas do not exceed 60 per cent of the existing village ""abadi"" area.
