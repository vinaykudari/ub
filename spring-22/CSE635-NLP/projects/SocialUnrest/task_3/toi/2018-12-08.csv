0,Bengal CM manages truce on terror law,"kolkata: the standoff between west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee and left front partners as well as the cpm hardliners in west bengal on the proposed prevention of organised crime act (poca) ended in a truce on thursday. according to the compromise formula, the state cabinet in its special meeting in kolkata on thursday decided not to introduce the bill in the ensuing winter session of the state assembly which began on friday. however, the cabinet ratified the bill, notwithstanding a ""note of dissent"" from the cpi and reservations from the rsp. in turn, bhattacharjee diluted some stringent provisions, earlier proposed in the draft ordinance on prevention of organised crime. announcing this after the cabinet meeting at the writers building, bhattacharjee, however, made it clear that the bill would be tabled in the assembly after the fate of the central ordinance on prevention of terrorism was decided in parliament. ""poto or no poto, we have to have our own law, poca, in the state. we are waiting for parliament to clinch the poto issue"" he declared. according to him, amendments moved by the partners have been accommodated in the new draft of the bill and there are scopes for further amendments. the changes made related to: the definition of an organised crime, provisions for bails and filing of chargesheets. the new 'comprehensive' definition identified three major crimes: kidnapping for ransom, hijacking and killing with the aim of armed insurgency or communal flare-up.

1,Global tender for Ranchi’s development opposed,"ranchi: the indian institute of architects (iia) president balbir verma on thursday condemned the jharkhand government's decision to invite global tender for planning, design and supervision work for the development of greater ranchi, the capital city of jharkhand state. instead, the jharkhand government should have formed a core team of professionals from amongst architects, town planners, urban designers, and urban administrators to identify indian firms with necessary background and expertise, verma said. he told tnn that an architect's vision mattered much. hence, it would be a futile exercise to float a tender and opt for the lowest bidder as it would lead to a 'third-rate planning set-up'. it is something like selecting the lowest charging cardiac surgeon instead of the best. or, he asked, was there a tender for the lowest charging orthopaedic surgeon when the prime minister's knees were to be operated upon? verma was here in connection with a national seminar on 'the challenges for urban development in the newly-formed states', organised by birla institute of technology, mesra. he said that the iia had written to the jharkhand government in july itself, protesting against the global tender for consultancy services for planning and design of greater ranchi. the iia president said the tender asked for depositing earnest money. the interested parties had to buy related documents. these conditions, he said, may have prevented many professionals from even inquiring. on thursday, verma submitted a copy of the iia's july letter of protest to jharkhand urban development minister bachcha singh at the inaugural function of the national seminar.

2,Tamil Nadu bandh passes off peacefully,"chennai: barring stray incidents of stone throwing on state-owned corporation buses in various parts of tamil nadu, the dawn-to-dusk bandh called by the dmk, the congress and left parties, to protest the steep hike in power tariff, bus fares and pds rice prices, passed off peacefully friday. the bjp, an ally of the dmk-led nda in the state, did not participate in the bandh, though it was opposed to the hike announced recently. while a top state government official described the bandh as a 'flop', dmk president and former chief minister, m karunanidhi said it was a 'success'. the director general of police, b p nailwal, said police fired in the air to disperse an unruly mob which attempted to damage public properties at sangilipatti in dharmapuri district. a total of 12,213 persons, including one cpi member of parliament, 14 members of the state assembly, were taken into preventive custody. the arrested mlas included some former ministers. nailwal said the strike evoked 'poor response' as buses and trains were operated normally. essential servies such as milk, water and power supplies were maintained. private vehicles, autos and taxis and other commercial vehicles plied throughout the state. he said all government educational institutions functioned with full attendance. some private schools remained closed. there was 90 per cent attendance in state and central government offices. the attendance in banks, textile mills, and industrial establishments was 'normal'. a coimbatore report said shops, which remained closed in the morning, opened later. in tiruppur, majority of shops remained closed, evoking only partial response to the bandh. leaders of seven trade unions, including citu, aituc and dmk-backed lpf, claimed in a joint statement that the bandh was a 'total success'. they urged the government for total rollback of the hike. the partial rollback would not satisfy the people. the cpi and cpi-m state leaders also wanted total rollback.

3,"In UP, parties look beyond elections","new delhi: with just two months to go for the state elections in uttar pradesh and predictions of yet another hung assembly, the major political parties in the fray are already decided on post-poll partners. currently, conversations with members of the bjp, the samajwadi party, the bahujan samaj party and the congress make it clear that while all four are wary of any pre-poll pact, the post-election line-up will be: bjp-bsp versus sp-congress. in the last few days, the increased bonhomie between the sp and the congress was evident not just at the dinner — and then breakfast — hosted by cpm leader somnath chatterjee, but also at the iftaar party at sp leader mulayam singh yadav's residence, organised by amar singh, where yadav and sonia posed amiably together for the cameras. while both parties are wary of a formal tie-up, the upswing in bjp's graph over the last year after rajnath singh took over as chief minister, has forced a rethink. the feeling is that even without a formal tie-up, the message that the two are not averse to forming a government together, will be beneficial. for one, there is a great deal of pressure from muslims and some degree of muslim consolidation is likely in favour of this combination. the brahmins on their part, are unhappy with the ascendancy of rajnath singh as cm, and the apparent influence of his fellow thakurs. they feel that they would not mind returning to congress, but only if it is seen as part of a winning team. that could happen if the congress is seen in the company of the sp. on the other front, rajnath singh, bjp sources stress, is not keen at all to be seen as being close to the bsp — for he knows a post-electoral bjp-bsp combination, regardless of the seats each party wins, would ensure that mayawati would be the next chief minister. this is not merely because it is the price the bsp leader would demand. it is also because — bjp sources stress — the entire brahmin leadership of the congress, be it the prime minister, human resource development minister murli manohar joshi or state chief kalraj mishra, all favour such an arrangement, even though officially this is clothed in the phrase samajik samrasta.

4,Cong thumbs down amended terror law,"new delhi: the congress on friday firmly rejected the proposed amendments to the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), describing them as ""marginal and cosmetic"" and added that its opposition remains ""unchanged and undiluted"". congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy told reporters that the amendments recommended by the cabinet are intended as a sop to the nda partners, who had also expressed their reservations about the proposed legislation. ""these amendments do not deserve any consideration,"" he declared. reddy reiterated that the congress party's opposition to poto remains as vigorous as ever, especially since many of its features still stay draconian.according to reddy, poto does not define terrorism but only defines a terrorist act. this definition, he said, is so vague and sweeping that everybody and anybody can be brought within its dragnet. the provision regarding the confession to a police officer being treated as a piece of evidence can lend itself to terrible abuse. he further said that poto will not be administered at the level of ministers and senior bureaucrats, but by policemen down the line. thus, any person detained under poto will be in jail without trial or bail. the left too, refused to accept the changed poto. describing the proposed amendments in poto as ""cosmetic changes"" cpi-m, leader and rajya sabha member nilotpal basu said poto should be allowed to lapse and de nove discussions should be started. the amendments were not substantial and the basixc character of the bill remained anti-democratic, it was said.

5,"Naxal ban flawed, say experts","new delhi: experts feel the government decision to ban all the front organisations of the people's war group and maoist communist centre under the new anti-terror ordinance poto might not stand legal scrutiny. legal experts draw a parallel between the ban on the ultra-left pwg and mcc and that on the rss and vhp after the demolition of the babri masjid in december 1992. at that time, none of the fronts of the rss (such as the bjp and abvp) and vhp (such as the durga vahini) had been banned as a consequence of the ban on their parent organisations, they point out. but in the case of pwg and mcc — each of which have several overground 'front' or 'mass' organisations with large memberships among students, women, workers, peasants and even writers and cultural artistes — a large number of associated bodies have also been banned. ""to be consistent, that is my plea,"" said noted legal expert and former law minister shanti bhushan. drawing a parallel between the two situations he said, ""it is not justified. these issues involve the question of discrimination."" another supreme court lawyer, i u khan, felt that the government perhaps thinks it can be harsh on the maoist groups because their political clout is insignificant. ""they do not seem to have the vote-bank and therefore not much political clout,"" khan said. he also feels that chances of redressal are feeble even if someone moves the court challenging the ban on the front organisations. ""they can approach the court but they are unlikely to get relief because the court might not interfere,"" khan said. bhushan, however, differs, saying ""they have a chance."" the naxalite groups and mainline left parties on their part have called for withdrawal of the ban. ""to bracket them with the jaish-e-mohammad or lashkar-e-taiba is to curb any dissent and attack any movement,"" the cpi said in a statement, pointing out that the pwg and mcc were not on the original list contained in poto. dipankar bhattacharya, general secretary of the cpi(ml), said, ""as for pwg and mcc, these are underground organisations and are already banned in some states. ""but the loaded reference to all their formations and front organisations is mischievous and arbitrary.""

12,"Air show, rally bring traffic to standstill","hyderabad: with several aircraft from the indian air force hovering over the hussain sagar, vehicular traffic came to a standstill for over an hour in the surrounding areas on friday. though the traffic police imposed restrictions on the movement of vehicles between 11 am and noon, few people respected the rules and stopped their vehicles in the middle of the pathways, leading to traffic snarls all around. for about one hour, no vehicle could pass through the lumbini park route to visveswaraya statue on khairatabad flyover and on the necklace road. the police had not allowed vehicles to ply on the upper tank bund road, forcing the people to use the congested dbr mills-lower tank bund-indira park-domalguda roads. the narrow roads in these localities failed to take on the increased volume of traffic, resulting in further traffic jams. traffic snarls were also witnessed on the secretariat road-ambedkar statue-liberty road. at several places, the traffic police themselves were found looking skywards, catching a glance of the air show rather than maintaining traffic.with no one to guide, several school buses got stranded on the necklace road and ntr marg. not a single traffic constable could be sighted on the necklace road starting from rotary park to police outpost, beyond people's plaza. after the show was over, it took more than an hour to clear the traffic congestion. due to the traffic jams, several people were forced to take long routes. meanwhile, a rally held by madiga reservation porata samithi (mrps) that culminated near indira park added to the chaos on the streets towards rtc crossroads. the mrps was demanding the implementation of land reforms act and distribution of surplus government lands to people belonging to scheduled castes (scs) and scheduled tribes (sts). the rally began from sundaraiah park in baghlingampally and waded its way through vst-rtc crossroads-ashok nagar. though the police permitted the mrps to hold a rally, elaborate security arrangements were made to prevent any untoward incidents. the mrps has a history of holding the city under seize on a couple of occasions by staging road blockades earlier and police did not want to take any chances this time. when the rally was passing through the rtc crossroads, it blocked the main artery connecting the secunderabad-koti route for over an hour.with the police closing the upper tank bund route for the air show on friday, and the lower tank bund for construction of flyover, the secunderabad-koti route was the only main route left connecting the secunderabad and hyderabad areas. the situation was compounded with several heavy vehicles entering the small bylanes in chikkadpally, himayatnagar, ashoknagar, jawaharnagar,baghlimpally localities to take diversions. the traffic police had a tough time maintaining orderly flow of vehicles and normalcy was restored only in the afternoon.

16,Advani vows to push ahead anti-terror law,"new delhi: union home minister lal krishna advani on saturday said the government would push on with a new anti-terror law regardless of resistance by opposition political parties. ""our government's approach has been of accommodating every viewpoint and attempting to build a consensus on various issues. however, even if there is no unanimity, we cannot abdicate our responsibility towards national security,"" advani told a public gathering. the home minister said the lack of consensus could not become an excuse for inaction on the issue. the cabinet had on thursday bowed to pressure from the opposition by agreeing to major changes in its new anti-terror law, including curtailing its operational period from five to three years. the cabinet also recommended the deletion of a provision affecting the freedom of the press. the law had made it mandatory for anyone, including journalists, with information about potential acts of terrorism to pass it on to security officials. the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), which was introduced last month by prime minister atal bihari vajpayee's cabinet, is yet to be passed by parliament and faces widespread criticism. the measure seeks to curb funding to suspected terrorist groups, confiscate their property and intercept their communications. it will give police and paramilitary forces far-reaching powers for arresting suspected terrorists and raiding their hideouts. opposition parties fear that the law will be misused as it gives sweeping powers to the police to question and detain people suspected of having information about terrorists. the legislation has to be passed by both houses of parliament or it will lapse on december 21. the bjp has made a strong case for poto, saying it is essential to curb growing islamic militancy in jammu and kashmir and a rise in terrorist incidents in other parts of the country.
