0,Bhattal to protest if paddy price not announced soon,"LUDHIANA: Punjab agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal on Thursday threatened to launch agitation against the Central government if it failed to announce minimum support price (MSP) for paddy within three days.Interacting with mediapersons after inaugurating the two-day kisan mela at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) here, Bhattal came down heavily on the Centre for adopting discriminatory attitude towards Punjab.She said that besides releasing only one installment of Rs one crore against the state's demand for Rs 800 crore, the Centre had not bothered even to send any team to the state to assess the crop damage.Emphasising on the need to rise above political considerations to help the peasantry to wriggle out of the crisis, the minister said they were trying to form a pressure group for this purpose in the north zone. For this they planned to invite various organisations espousing farmers' cause. When asked, she categorically said the Akalis would not be part of such a group. Bhattal alleged that the SAD was playing a negative role on the issue of securing relief from the central government since it was an ally of the government. In her inaugural address, Bhattal said the Congress government had chalked out a comprehensive plan to encourage contractfarming in the state. Besides, the government had planned to divert 10,000 hactares area from under paddy to other crops. For this, five zones had been carved out to ensure adequate supply of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides to farmers.Each zone would be under the charge of a joint director of the agriculture department. The training needs and proper marketing of the produce would also be taken care under this plan, Bhattal said.'Stop Badal-bashing' A section of farmers started booing the minister of state for agriculture Amarjit Singh Samra when he remarked that being an ally in the NDA led government, the former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal had failed to show any concern on the issue of delay in announcement of procurement date and MSP for paddy by the central government. An embarrassed Samra had to change the tack immediately.

4,Gaurav yatra van may be flouting rules,"RAJKOT: Remember the anxious moments you went throughwhen an RTO squad stopped you on the highway and asked questions about fancy number plate, the writing on your vehicle or even the vehicle was overloaded, and at the end of the gruelling session you are asked to pay a fine of Rs 500 for breach of RTO rules.

You faced the music because you were a commoner while Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who travelled on his rath for on his Gaurav Yatra was allowed to go scotfree though some of the basic rules of the RTO were breached.

First and foremost, the height of the rath was a breach of the Motor Vehicle Act rules. According to rule 93 of the Motor Vehicle Act 1989, the total height of the vehicle must not exceed 3.8 metres.

However, the rath that took the chief minister to six districts in the second phase had a height of 25 feet, which was against the RTO rules.

In fact, it was the height of the rath that led to the top canopy touching the live wire at Dwarka. This led to short-circuit and subsequent blackout.

Though the height of the Swaraj Mazda, on which special fittings have been done to accommodate the chief minister on the long and tiring journey, was not a problem, the real problem started with the hydraulic lift which pops up the chief minister.

Even the special body work doneonthevehiclewasagainst the RTO rules. When the CM used the hydraulic lift to come on top of the van, the total height of the vehicles went up to almost 27 feet, which was againabreachof rules.

The RTO rules also stipulate that there should not be any writing on the vehicles.

As against this, Modiâ€™s rath had all sorts of writings and paintings. It is also doubtful if permission was taken for the making the necessary changes in the interior of the vehicle, and if the RTO was notified of the changes.

Or whether the change of the laden weight due to the changes in the body of the vehicle was notified to the RTO.

For every breach of RTO rules, the commonman is fined anywhere from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 depending on the crime and the vehicle one is using, but so far no offence seems to have been registered against the organisers of the Gaurav Yatra for breach of the RTO rules.

When contacted, the district authorities at Amreli and Jamnagar pleaded total ignorance on the issue. Even the localRTOofficers refused to divulge any information with regards to the Motor Vehicle Act and its clauses.

However, an RTO inspector wishing anonymity told TNNthat in case a complaint was filed action could be initiated against the owner of the Swaraz Mazda.

He, however, said he was not sure if action could be initiated against the chief minister for the breach of the RTO rules as it was not clear if he had hired the vehicle and then made the changes orwhether the party had hired it.

5,Poor planning cause of slow development of N-E: CM,"KOLKATA: Partnerships between the West Bengal government and information technology majors like the IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for setting up centres of excellence to produce professionals are in the offing, declared chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Kolkata on Thursday. He was addressing a seminar on economic development of the eastern and the north-eastern regions, organised by the Institution of Engineers (India). Ironically, there was no representative from the North-East and eastern states like Bihar and Orissa at the seminar.

Bhattacharjee said states in the eastern region were rich in mineral resources like coal and iron ore, while north-eastern states like Assam and Tripura had oil and natural gas.

Coal-bearing areas in Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal had large reserves of coal-based methane. Coastal areas of Orissa and West Bengal had potential for petroleum and natural gas, too.

Yet, the progress of these two regions has been rather tardy when compared to the rest of the country. Blaming the planning process for this, he said regional disparities had grown over the decades, leading to problems both economic and political.

â€œThe development of each state and region is essential for the countryâ€™s harmonious development,â€� remarked Bhattacharjee.

Under the new exploration licensing policy though, several coal bed methane blocks had been identified with exploration work in progress in many of these blocks. ONGC and GAIL were also engaged in exploration work for natural gas in one off-shore and one on-shore block in West Bengal and Orissa. With the commissioning of Haldia Petrochemicals, claimed the CM, 542 petrochemical downstream units had come up in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Assam.

6,"Puja bonus slashed for govt staff, teachers","KOLKATA: The cash-starved West Bengal government has decided to slash by half the bonus and Puja advance to its employees and teachers this year. The payout to employees in state government undertakings will, however, be as per the provisions of the Bonus Act. All payments will be made by October 11.

Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Thursday the government would have to bear an additional expenditure of Rs 100 crore, down from Rs 200 crore last year. Rs 1,000 will be paid as bonus to employees who earn up to Rs 8,300 per month, while the staff who draw up to Rs 12,000 will get the same amount as interest-free advance. State government pensioners will be given an ex gratia of Rs 400. â€œSalaries to teachers will be disbursed by October 8, a week in advance, in view of the festival,â€� Dasgupta said.

The state government is finding it difficult to mop up Rs 1,000 crore every month to pay salaries and retirement benefits to the 1 million people on its payroll. The finance department has drawn up measures to mop up additional revenue, mainly by raising nontax revenues.

These include hike in tariff and fees on several services before the Puja to garner an additional 20 per cent nontax revenue. While no new tax is proposed, collection target of sales tax, excise duty and stamp duties have been revised upwards by 15 per cent.

Dasgupta said the government had decided to introduce several austerity measures in government offices, including the state secretariat, to reduce non-plan expenditure by Rs 500 crore.

12,Sangh outfits lambast govt's economic policy,"NEW DELHI: In a blow to the government''s economic policy, three Sangh Parivar outfits, including its powerful trade union afiliate - Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS)- on Friday termed it as ""anti-labour, anti-farmer and anti-employment"" and alleged the state''s policies were being guided by people ""insensitive to national interests.""

Addressing a joint press conference here, the leaders of BMS, Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh - the RSS farmers'' wing - charged that the liberalisation, globalisation and privatisation policy had ""led to closures, retrenchments, reduced employment and suicides among farmers"" and announced a week-long country-wide agitation beginning September 25.

They specifically opposed foreign direct investment, disinvestment, the second Labour Commission Report and reduction in government subsidy to farmers.

Specifically targeting Planning Commission member N K Singh, who chaired the steering group on FDI, SJM all-India convener P Muralidhar Rao said, ""it is the responsibility of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to deliver services, which is not being done. Rather, people whose interests are doubtful and who are insensitive to national interests are formulating policies like FDI which are not based on scientific or objective logic or evaluation.""

""We hoped that the Vajpayee government would change the policies pursued by the previous governments and pursue a Swadeshi agenda. Instead the cost of power, irrigation and fertilisers have gone up, farmers are commiting suicide. Farmers are dying and MNCs are being pampered,"" said BKS president Kunwarji Bhai Jadhav.

13,Bangalore leads in suicide cases,"BANGALORE: The suicide by a 24-year-old girl by jumping off Mittal Towers on Tuesday reiterated Bangalore''s status as the suicide capital of India.

According to 1999 statistics, Bangalore leads the other cities in India with a reported 1,938 suicide cases. Mumbai comes second with 1,266 and Chennai third with 1,142 cases. Varanasi has the least with 76 cases.

Contrary to common belief, there are more men than women ending lives in Bangalore. Statistics with the Bangalore City Police revealed that only in the burning category women outnumber men, projecting the pathos of the ever growing dowry menace.

Dr Gururaj G., professor and head, department of epidemiology and Dr Mohan K. Isaac, professor, department of psychiatry, Nimhans, in their study, `Suicides - Beyond Numbers'' say that suicide is one of the four leading causes of mortality, others being natural, accidental and homicidal.

Dr Gururaj told The Times of India that two more Bangalore-specific studies focussing on the risk factors for suicides would be ready in two weeks. The studies are an effort to understand and prevent the rising number of suicides in the city.

In a recent case, the father of a dentist __ who jumped off Barton Centre after her choice of partner was rejected by the family __ filed a case against the boy for monetary settlement. Police sources say families of suicide victims turn bitter instead of learning lessons from the loss.

Grief counsellor Asha from Crest says some of the calls received at the centre come from people with suicidal tendencies. Experts who work in suicide prevention activity rue the fact that there is little understanding of the magnitude of the problem of suicidal behaviour which includes, ideation, attempts and completion.

According to the Nimhans study conducted in 2001, nearly 68 per cent of individuals who attempted suicide did not leave any clues nor inform anybody. Seventeen per cent of individuals intimated family or friends about their act, while relatives suspected suicide in 20 per cent of men and 12 per cent of women. Only four per cent left written chits. Interestingly, 17 per cent of care givers revealed that they had some suspicion about the person, two to four weeks prior to the act.

14,Jaya's statement on farmer's suicide irresponsible: Minister,"BANGALORE: Horticulture Minister M. Shivanna on Friday accused Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalitha of making ``irresponsible statements'''' that the Karnataka government ``pushed'''' a farmer to commit suicide at the Beechanahalli dam to prevent the release of water.

Shivanna, who represents the H.D. Kote assembly constituency where the incident occurred, said the farmer, K. Guruswamy, was one of his followers. ""He has campaigned for me in every election. I called on his family and paid my last respects as soon as I got to know of the incident,"" he added.

Shivanna said Guruswamy suffered from high blood-pressure. ""He must have got carried away by the emotional intensity of the moment and jumped. He had asked for my support to become Beechanahalli gram panchayat president,"" he said.

Denying reports that he was gheraoed and heckled by friends and relatives of Guruswamy when he visited the village, Shivanna said, ""All this is being spread by KRRS members, Kurubur Shantakumar and Mallesh. Guruswamy''s relatives themselves were there to receive me.""

Shivanna said he would take the responsibility for the welfare of Guruswamy''s family. ""His two daughters are married, while his son is young yet. But I will take care of them, while we will see what can be done from the government''s side also,'''' he added.

More than 1,900 ETT trainees have been on warpath after the government announced to upwardly revise the qualifying percentage of marks from 50 to 55 per cent in the plus two examination.

Raising slogans against the state government, the students took out a protest march in the town and termed the new education policy a crude joke. The students said that in case the state government did not withdraw the policy, the students would spur up their agitation.

Criticising the new education policy, which made it mandatory for the ETT teachers to do internship for two years before appointment, the students alleged that instead of checking the unemployment, the new policy would help increase it, said Satvinder Singh, president of the students. He said while the state government was seeking upgradation of education standard, the teachers were being engaged in all sundry jobs like census, cooking meals for children and other election related duties.

The demonstrators threatened to intensify their agitation if their demands were not accepted by September 22. And threatened to gherao all state ministers if the government did not withdraw its education policy. Amritsar: Hundreds of Elementary Teachers Training (ETT) students, on Friday, staged a dharna at Bhandari Bridge and blocked traffic for about two hours in support of their demands. They also burnt the effigy of education minister Khushal Behal.

Investigation by the bureau has found that the selection procedure and norms were violated by all members the PSSSB , four of whom were subsequently arrested.

all, 4,762 selections were made by the board members. It has been found that the members would â€˜â€˜shareâ€™â€™ seats amongst themselves for all the posts and extract bribes from candidates which varied from Rs 50,000 Rs 4 to 5 lakh for each post.

While all the recruitments were made on the basis of interviews, which was purely an arbitrary exercise, written tests were held only for the posts of clerks, block development officers and naib tehsildars.

Incidentally, the records of all written tests held by the PSSSB went missing. It is suspected that all answer scripts were burnt by the then authorities. Former PSSSB secretary Zora Singh, a PCS officer, who held the post for about seven years, has been held responsible for destroying the records.

Even as he assisted the VB during the initial stages of the investigation, the PCS officer fled the scene when he was asked to furnish records of the written tests.

As he has been missing for the last about 18 days, the VB has initiated proceedings against him to declare him a proclaimed offender. The state government placed him under suspension on Thursday.

Meanwhile, former PSSSB chairman T P S Sandhu, who has been absconding for about one and a half months, is believed to have sounded VB officials about his whereabouts and has offered to join the investigation by September 23. Earlier, he had pleaded that since his father held the post of the PSSSB chairman for most of the time, he had no knowledge about the irregularities committed by the board.

20,Why arrest announcement was delayed,"NEW DELHI: Why did the CBI and the Union home ministry took so much time in confirming the arrest of gangster Abu Salem?

As a CBI official remarked, it was a case of once bitten twice shy. â€˜â€˜Our past experiences of Abu Salemâ€™s arrest have been quite painful. On one occasion, he was officially arrested, but later released by the UAE government and the other time, it was unofficially known to us but still we could do nothing to ensure that he stays behind bars and is later extradited to India.â€™â€™

Recalling his official arrest in 1997, a CBI official said: â€˜â€˜When our top embassy official went to the police chief of Dubai for confirmation of his arrest, they were told the man who was arrested is one Akil Ahmad Azmi and he has got only a facial resemblance with Abu Salem. Our agency immediately sent all the documents proving that Akil was Abu Salem and that he was travelling on a fake passport.â€™â€™

CBI sources said a case was registered in India, RC1(A)/97 STF Delhi, but the UAE authorities did not even bother to match the finger-prints of Akil with that of Abu Salem.

In this same case, the CBI even sent details of Abu Salemâ€™s wife Samira Jumani, proving that she and Akil Ahmad Azmiâ€™s wife were also the same person.

The CBI official said, â€˜â€˜I have been following his career closely and unlike other underworld dons, he is absolutely unscrupulous and has even cheated his other underworld colleagues on several occasions in the past.â€™â€™

The CBI sources said that Salemâ€™s arrest also means that a large number of hawala operators in the will get exposed.

â€˜â€˜Salem made huge amounts of money through extortion and in the underworld he is known as the extortion king.

He knew all the top hawala operators and is the only underworld don these days who does not believe in making a base in one country, but relies on his recruits in India and his mobile phones,â€™â€™ the source said.

â€˜â€˜Transnational organised crime cannot be curbed until and unless countries cooperate with each other.

â€œBefore the terrorist attack on World Trade Center, even the US authorities did not whole-heartedly take a stand against terrorism and they had to pay a price for it.â€� â€œSo this time, we are hopeful of interrogating Salem in India,â€™â€™ the CBI official said.
