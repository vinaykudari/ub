2,NGO relocates riot-hit students,"HYDERABAD: The children are too young to realise the impact of being displaced from their homes and separated from families in Gujarat as communal violence took its toll.

A voluntary organisation, Muslim Educational Social and Cultural Organisation (MESCO) took the initiative and relocated 41 children from various camps in Gujarat to Hyderabad.

The organisationâ€™s joint secretary K A Sattar Khan said students whose families were affected by the communal violence would be provided education up to post graduation free of cost, including accommodation.

Shaik Imran of Jamalpur had to discontinue education as the transport office of his father was burnt down. MESCO proposes to bring a second batch of 45 students to help them pursue education. It also hopes to set up educational institutions in Gujarat.

3,Ex-Cabinet minister's remand extended,"JALANDHAR: Former Cabinet minister Ajit Singh Kohar, who was produced before the chief judicial magistrate AS Grewal for extension of police remand was, however, sent to judicial remand for 14 days.

Kohar was arrested from the DC office complex on Friday by the Vigilance Bureau on charges of possession of property beyond his known sources of income. Thereafter his sonâ€™s locker in Uco Bank, Shahkot, was sealed. However, the VB could not convince the court to extend police remand.

Withdrawal of judgesâ€™ work: Confusion in courts: There was uncertainty and confusion among litigants who had come from far off places here on Wednesday as the work allotted to the five â€œtaintedâ€� judges from Jalandhar could not be assigned to any other judge.

The work allotted to the five judges was withdrawn from them on the orders of Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday. The staff concerned is not clear what to do.

A number of litigants could not find out about the next dates. Bakshish Singh Bhagmal appeared in his civil case in the court of SK Goel on the assigned date. However, SK Goel figures in the list of judges from whom work was withdrawn.

â€œIt took me several hours of waiting to get to know my next date,â€� said Bhagmal. The other four judges from whom work was withdrawn are KK Singla, DK Mittal, Vijay Kumar and Manpreet Kaur Bhatia. None of them were available for comment here on Wednesday.

Lawyers are worried mostly about criminal cases pending before these judges. Rajinder Kumar, a civil case litigant, said â€œsome alternative arrangement should have been made. There could have been fresh recruitments so that the backlog does not build up further.â€�

The lawyers have by-and-large welcomed the move. â€œPeople will think twice before trying to buy their way into jobs,â€� says vice-president of Lawyersâ€™ Committee for Human Rights and Justice, Barinderjit Singh.

4,The raj rules 55 years after swaraj,"KOLKATA: All letters to the chief ministerâ€™s office, even those in poor taste, are summarised and recorded by a secretary after a clerk has already labelled them â€œunfit for CMâ€�. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee does not get to see them ever, but the tradition is maintained in true colonial fashion where everything is put down on paper for posterity.

Every decision at the secretariat, even a grievance, passes through an elaborate chain, beginning with a dealing assistant and ending with the department secretary. In between, it goes through the tables of assistant/section officer, assistant secretary, deputy secretary, joint secretary and special secretary. Then the file makes the reverse journey. Itâ€™s always happened this way.

Fifty-five years after India threw out its colonial rulers, the Raj legacy remains entrenched at government offices. Peons and junior clerks at Writersâ€™ Buildings still address seniors as sahibs and are referred to as ardalis (orderlies). At the Lalbazar, the ji-huzoor culture persists and a strict divide exists between officers above the rank of assistant commissioner and the force below.

â€œThe mindset of bureaucrats remains colonial. The British have left behind a hierarchical system that is mired in red-tape,â€� says coordination committee joint secretary Jyoti Prasad Basu. The babus were created by the British to rule, not administer, the Indians. They still do the same â€” rule.

Utpal Majumdar of rival group, the West Bengal Government Employees Union (Nabaparjay), felt the governmentâ€™s functioning had remained unchanged as had behaviour of seniors towards juniors. â€œThe language in official correspondence, too, is archaic,â€� he said. Kolkata Police Association general secretary Pradyut Kumar Mondal says the lower ranks in the force are treated inhumanly by superiors. The constables, in turn, vent their frustration on the common man. At the police headquarters, itâ€™s still the rule of the Raj. Despite axing the orderly system, constables are still engaged by seniors to do household chores â€” shopping vegetables, washing clothes and even polishing shoes.

The National Police Commission had offered many recommendations to do away with some of the unnecessary rituals and so has the Administrative Reforms Commission headed by Ashok Mitra. While a few of them have been implemented, most are gathering dust.

5,Buying brides to cheer farm help?,"TARN TARAN: Anything to make farm help happy, even if it means buying a bride for him. And to keep them tilling your fields and tending to your home till kingdom comes.

Full marks for giving a new twist to benevolent lordship. The only problem is what is paternalistic care to some is permanent slavery to others.

Nothing wrong with guarding business interests, but when rich farmers play matchfixers for their farm helps there is no knowing how knotty the story is going to get. Sometime back, Jyoti Rashmi, a thirteen-year-old minor, was allegedly bought by Harpal Singh, a farmer, from a nondescript village in Maharashtra to marry her with his annoying farm help who had threatened to quit work and leave for home to get married.

To persuade Raju, Harpal, with the consent of his family, allegedly bought Jyoti from a village near Nanded Sahib, Maharastra, from his own sources on a payment of Rs 16,000. Only a few days ago, he got Jyoti married to Raju.

The fringe benefit for the farmer: free housemaid who would work for the farmerâ€™s family as bonded labour and keep the farm help sated and loyal. And, forever in debt.

Sources alleged that Raju owed some money to Harpal, who in return of getting him married asked him to pay a hefty amount in instalments that may take several years to clear.

On getting a tip-off, the police reportedly raided the farm house of Harpal and recovered Jyoti and Raju. Harpal was found absconding, said unconfirmed reports. Police sources said that Jyoti had admitted that she was married to Raju in a gurdwara near Chabhal under the influence of some intoxicant. Post-marriage, Jyoti was renamed as Rani.

DSP Gurpreet Singh, when contacted, said that they had recovered Jyoti and were carrying on further investigation. The DSP added that they had information on another girl from Maharashtra and they were trying to recover her, too.

Jyotiâ€™s case is not an isolated instance. The trading of girls was not entirely new to the area, sources said.

The girls were being bought from the poverty-stricken areas for anything between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 and were further sold to work as slaves for a negotiable price that could go up to Rs 25,000, they said drily.

6,Party work beckons some BJP ministers,"NEW DELHI: Some changes in the Union council of ministers, largely within the BJP, are expected in the next few days. This is part of the BJPâ€™s decision to send some more ministers back to the organisation to reinvigorate it for the next elections, highly placed sources said.

While minister of state for personnel Vasundhara Raje is likely to be named Rajasthan BJP chief soon, her ministerial colleagues, Chamanlal Gupta and Pon Radhakrishnan, party sources say, are headed for Jammu and Kashmir and Tamil Nadu, respectively, as state bosses.

This is in addition to Raman Singh taking over as the chief of the partyâ€™s Chhatisgarh unit after leaving the Union ministry recently.

There is still a question mark over the departure of Uma Bharati for Madhya Pradesh (MP). She still does not want to become the MP chief.

But if she agrees to go, then there will be five vacancies in the Unio n council of ministers. These slots will be filled by BJP MPs, it is learnt.

At one stage, it was expected that these changes would take place after Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee made her peace with the BJP so that she could be inducted as well into the cabinet.

She is due to meet the Prime Minister in a couple of days, but at this stage, there is not much hope of any compromise being arrived at.

7,India has to counter moves to disrupt J&K polls: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Thursday reacted sharply to Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf''s statement on the coming Jammu and Kashmir elections, saying it should serve as a ""warning"" for New Delhi to take all possible steps to counter any move to disrupt the poll process.

""Musharraf''s statement is a warning for all of us. We should not lower our guard in maintaining security in Jammu and Kashmir and in successfully carrying out the democratic process in the state,"" Advani said when asked his reaction to Pakistan President''s statement.

He expressed surprise that ""a government which has come to power through a military coup is making such comments on a neighbouring democratic country and ridiculing the poll process"".

""This attitude needs to be taken note of not just by the entire country, but by the international community also"", Advani said.

8,EC decision on Gujarat polls by Saturday,"NEW DELHI: One week after their tour of the riot-affected areas in Ahmedabad and Vadodara, the three election commissioners are said to be close to reaching a decision on the scheduling of elections in Gujarat. According to Election Commission (EC) sources, Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh might announce the verdict as early as Friday or Saturday.

Despite the intense pressure being brought to bear by the BJP, which this week accused the EC of being biased, the three commissioners are likely to take a decision purely on the basis of what they saw and learned during their visit to the state. And the indications so far suggest that an early election -- as desired by Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi -- is unlikely.

Contrary to BJP spokesman Arun Jaitley''s claim that ``98 per cent of Gujarat was unaffected by the violence'''', local intelligence reports provided to the election commissioners in Ahmedabad said at least 154 of the 182 Assembly segments in the state had been affected by the riots. The intelligence presentation also stated that almost one lakh voters have been ``disenfranchised''''.

Apparently the observations of this survey had not been put before the EC officials team, which visited Gujarat before the election commissioners, top sources in the Gujarat home department told TNN. The survey, based on the events from February 27 to May 30, found that nearly 992 villages and 151 towns under 225 police stations had been directly affected by the violence following Godhra. These villages and towns are regarded today as ``extra communally sensitive'''', the intelligence report noted.

The EC was told that nearly 80,000 persons of seven districts had moved to newer areas out of fear, while 20,000 to 30,000 non-Gujarati voters, who had lost their homes in the riots, had fled to neighbouring states.

Police officials in Gujarat are reported to have privately informed Lyngdoh and his colleagues of their apprehensions about violence and even forced

9,Modi's I-Day message: Early polls a must,"AHMEDABAD: Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday re-iterated his demand for early elections in the state. At an Independence Day function, he said the best alternative to take Gujarat out of uncertainty was to provide it the right direction for progress, with new confidence and pledge to give its 5 crore people the earliest opportunity to elect the government of their choice.

He also announced the state''s policies for population control and education, and said modern education would be provided to students in rural areas with the help of Internet.

The new education policy includes provisions for students studying at madrassas, upgradation of Sainik schools in border areas, and education in the English medium.

Schools in border areas would be upgraded and made independent Sainik schools, he said.

Modi called upon the people of Gujarat to join the state''s march for good governance and present it as an ideal state before the nation.

""Just as Gujarat was on the forefront in the country''s fight for freedom under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, let the state take a lead in providing good governance for the posterity,"" he said.

Governor Sundarsinh Bhandari unfurled the Tricolour at the Raj Bhavan in Gandhinagar.

10,Govt aims at investment-friendly climate: CM,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief Minister A K Antony on Thursday said the main objective of the state government was to create an ""investor friendly"" climate and lay a solid foundation for the formation of a ""new Kerala"".

Speaking after hoisting the national flag at the Central Stadium here on the occasion of the Independence day on Thursday, Antony, said ""the old Kerala model of development had lost its relevance in the present context.""

Pointing out that Kerala had made progress particularly in education and health, he said it has lagged behind in productivity and that now it has become consumer oriented.

""The state must adopt the changes that are taking place in the fields of IT and telecommunication. It should also bring out reforms in agriculture, labour and industry. Otherwise it will be very difficult for the state to progress,"" he said.

The Chief Minister said private investment was inevitable for growth as ""generating employment opportunities with funds from the state exchequer was very difficult due to the poor financial position of the government.""

Lamenting that state''s labour track-record was not good enough to attract private investments, he said changes brought out by the government in its labour policy and passing of the Loading and Unloading Workers Bill were steps to erase the militant trade union image of the state.

11,Cargo handling capacity at Bangalore airport increases,"BANGALORE: Air-cargo handling capacity at Bangalore airport received a boost on Thursday with the inauguration of a new joint complex facility raised by three Public Sector Undertakings.

It has been put up by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Container Corporation of India Limited and Mysore Sales International Limited at a cost of around Rs two crore.

Lufthansa and Air France, among others, have evinced interest in air cargo transporation in and out of Bangalore, HAL Chairman and Managing Director N R Mohanty said at a function on the occasion.

The warehouse complex, located near Apron 3 inside the airport, has a total covered storage area of 28,000 sq ft, import storage area of 18,000 sq ft and export storage area of 10,000 sq ft.

It was noted that the air cargo complex being operated by MSIL outside the airport terminal is constrained for further growth owing to non-availability of space for expansion.

The new complex has modern handling equipment and uniflow system of movement of cargo for smooth and efficient handling of cargo, officials said. Customs formalities for clearance of cargo can be done from this warehouse.

13,Vaghela accuses BJP of engineering riots,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Congress president Shankersinh Vaghela continued his attack on the BJP on Wednesday alleging that the party had even gone to the extent of triggering the communal violence to fulfil its political ambitions.

Addressing a Youth Congress rally in Ahmedabad on Wednesday, Vaghela said there was something mysterious about the massacre of ''kar sevaks'' at Godhra. ""Failing to address any of the promises of the last election, the recent incidents of violence were planned to divert public attention,"" Vaghela told a gathering of about 15,000 workers from all districts.

Though specific issues like communal violence, electricity and water problems at the village level were highlighted by the state Congress chief, Vaghela singled out L K Advani for criticism. He said Advani had promised four years ago that people could go to Kashmir for honeymoon if the BJP was voted to power. Today, he said, Advani could not even protect the Amarnath yatris. ""The BJP rule in the state could only bring shame to peaceful land of the Mahatma,"" he asserted.

Vaghela also mentioned issues of increasing unemployment in the state and large-scale mismanagement of banks, earthquake relief and rehabilitation.

Speaking on the occasion, the state Congress Legislature Party chief Amarsinh Chaudhary appealed to the youth of Gujarat to drive the BJP out of power. ""With factories closing down every now and then, farmers remaining neglected and increasing insecurity among citizen, the party has no right to remain in power,"" he said.

14,"Regulate sugar prices, Sena MLC urges govt","MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MLC Kanhayalal Gidwani has urged the state government to regulate sugar prices in the open market by reducing the rates of its stock sold at the public distribution outlets and the co-operative societies across the state.

â€œThe present government rate of Rs 15 per kg is inflated and it can be slashed to Rs 14 without suffering any losses,"" Mr Gidwani said at a press conference held on Wednesday.

He said sugar sold in the open market would be priced higher as the traders would base it to the governmentâ€™s inflated rate of Rs 15.

The Sena MLC said the state accounted for 40 per cent of the national sugar produce and there was abundant stock in the godowns of the state sugar cooperatives.

Moreover, the export rate of the sugar was much less, he said, adding that a sugar cooperative in Surat recently dispatched a huge consignment of sugar abroad for Rs 10 per kg.

â€œIf the Maharashtra marketing federation or the state consumers federation directly lifts sugar stocks from the co-operative mills it will have to pay Rs 11.25 for every kg. After calculating the transportation, octroi and packaging charges. the cost works out not more than Rs 14,"" he said.

The state government, however, has fixed Rs 15 on every kg of sugar sold by it and has indirectly helped the traders to increase its sugar price.

Mr Gidwani has written to chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh seeking his intervention to reduce the price of sugar sold by the state government.
