0,Unprecedented security for polls,"AHMEDABAD: It may not be a scene where the polling officers will have to wear bulletproof jackets as it happened in J&K, but the assembly elections, scheduled to be held soon, will see unprecedented security in the state, said top sources.

Indications hitherto are that the elections to all the 182 constituencies would be held in one single day, instead of two phases, with deployment of over twice the number of central security personnel as compared to earlier polls.

Officials fear direct confrontations between candidates could lead to violence in certain constituencies that are considered sensitive after the communal riots.

The Election Commission, which is due to declare the dates for assembly elections here anytime next week, has assured the state government of adequate security provisions to ensure peaceful conduct of polls.

Another reason why the emphasis on security is more, lies in the fact that the polls this time may see the entry of members of the Sangh Parivarâ€™s frontal organisations ""which could spark off problems,"" feared an official.

A top official told TNN, ""As against a demand of some 180 companies of para-military central forces,we maybe getting 400 companies."" And this would be over and above the local police, SRP, border wing and homeguards.

Districts like Panchmahals, Sabarkantha, Mehsana, Vadodara, Ahmedabad and Rajkot, being sensitive, are likely to be closely monitored. ""But a clear picture of the confrontations and possibilities of violence will emerge only after the list of candidates of the two major political parties are finalised,"" said a senior police officer.

""The sensitiveness of a constituency can be judged only on the basis of the candidateâ€™s political stronghold,"" the officer added.

The visit of leaders, especially those under the security category of Z and above, to address election meetings here will also increase the fears of the security agencies.

1,Women lawyers defy dress code,"GHAZIABAD: A resolution passed by the local bar association''s executive committee barring women lawyers from wearing jeans and shirts in the court''s compound has met with sharp criticism, with several of the 150-odd women lawyers here refusing to comply with it.

""What we wear inside our chambers is an issue between our clients and us. Women in the Supreme Court and high courts even enter court rooms wearing jeans and trousers. The emphasis in the Advocates Act framed 42 years back is on sobriety and dignity,"" said a woman lawyer.

""If any dress code has to be imposed, the Bar Council of India will do so. A dozen members of the local executive committee cannot decide what we wear,"" said advocate Anjana Sharma. ""The resolution is sexist. Why is it that male lawyers wearing safari suits or dhotis are not stopped?"" said advocate Noor Jehan.

""Nobody can object to women lawyers in formal black trousers in any court, even though the Advocate Act of 1961 does not mention trousers for women lawyers,"" Supreme Court advocate Indira Jaisingh.

Bar association secretary Pramod Sharma, however, defends the decision. ""Even while sitting in his or her own chamber, a lawyer should look dignified. Jeans and tight trousers are not dignified,"" Sharma said.

Refuting this argument, lawyer Veena Sharma said, ""Women in the police and armed forces wear trousers. What''s wrong with that?""

""That is part of their dress code,"" said Sharma. ""The Advocates Act does not include jeans or trousers as a woman lawyer''s uniform.""

Defending the decision, the executive committee''s only female member, Suman Sharma, said: ""The court compound has its own dignity. Jeans and tops do not go with that dignity.""

2,"SP, BJP rebels rally behind Raja Bhaiyya","LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party and BJP dissidents on Sunday rallied behind Raghuraj Pratap Singh, MLA from Kunda and leader of Independents who have withdrawn support to Mayawati-led government, following cases filed against him and his father Uday Bhan Singh in Pratapgarh on Saturday.

On his arrival from New Delhi,SP general secretary Amar Singh along with some Independents and dissident leaders went to Bhadri House,residence of Singh, popularly known as Raja Bhaiyya , and held discussions for over an hour.

After the meeting the leaders condemned the filing of cases against Raja Bhaiyya in strong words. They expressed apprehension that he might be arrested. But if that happened we would demolish this government brick by brick, warned the leaders.

Amar Singh condemned the FIR and took potshots at Vinay Katiyar and Lalji Tandon . He did not spare governor Vishnu Kant Shatri also. ""He is behaving more like a Rastriya Swayam Sevak Sangh worker than as a Rajyapal,"" said Amar Singh.He challenged Mayawati, Tandon and Katiyar to convene the assembly and test their strength. ""The Samajwadi Party would bring a no confidence motion against the government"" he said.

From Raja Bhaiyyaâ€™s place, Singh went to Ganga Bhakt Singhâ€™s residence and stayed their some time. Singh claimed that more than one third of BJP MLAs were ready to join hands with the SP to topple the Mayawati government and form an alternative government. Some dissident leaders who were also present at Ganga Bhakt Singhâ€™s residence, condemned the filing of cases against Raja Bhaiyya and his father and other repressive measures taken by the government. ""This would not help the the government in any way,"" said Ganga Bakht Singh.

When asked by newsmen whether they still want to hold talks with the Prime Minister Vajpayee ,the dissident leaders said :â€� Will talks serve any purpose when repressive measures were being taken unabashedly?â€�

Ganga Bakht Singh said if the prime minister was sincere to his words he should ask his men to stop this kind of repressive measures and only then hold talks with the dissidents. When asked by mediapersons whether he had plans to meet the governor, the veteran leader evaded a direct reply.

Most of the dissident leaders and Independents held the urban development minister Lalji Tandon responsible for this mess.Ganga Bhakt Singh said that the only way to save the BJP was to pull out of the government throw out men like Lalji Tandon. The dissident leaders said that the bogey of mid-term poll was raised to terrorise the dissidents and contain unrest.

3,Minister rules out divestment of Coal India,"PATNA: Junior Union coal and mines minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday ruled out the possibility of disinvestment of Coal India, saying it had made a record profit of Rs 1,755 crore during the last financial year despite revising the pay-scales of its employees with effect from January 1, 1997.

The CIL had incurred a loss of Rs 1,415 crore during the year 2000-2001. Prasad, however, justified the disinvestment policy of Vajpayee government, saying it was in the economic interests of the country.

If we wanted to attain a growth rate of 8 per cent, there was no other way out. With regard to the proposed disinvestment of Nalco, Prasad said that the coal ministry was not at all opposed to it although it had some reservations on the mode of disinvestment.

In order to buttress his point that disinvestment was beneficial, he said that the Balco, which had been disinvested early this year, had increased the salaries of its employees. It was going to invest Rs 5,000 crore on its expansion, he added.

Attributing the huge rise in the profit of CIL to increase in production and productivity, Prasad said that it had also reduced its manpower from a level of 5,86,896 on April 1, 1999 to 5,19,922 on April1, 2002. The expenditure under salary head had come down by Rs 840 crore due to reduction in its staff strength by 66,947.

Prasad said that with the Centre revising the royalty rates on persistent demand of different states, the annual income of coal producing states will increase by Rs 485 crore. He said that the CIL had saved 5.94 million tonnes of coal valued at Rs 480 crore by launching a drive for the verification of the status of 7,015 core sector consumers.

The verification drive had brought down the number of valid ""linked consumers"" to 4,788. In Bihar, he said, out of the 354 linked consumers, 220 had been found bogus.

Referring to Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC), Prasad said that it made a profit of Rs 819.20 crore during the last financial year, recording a growth of 13 per cent. This is the highest profit recorded since NLC began its operations, he added. During the year 2000-2001, he said, the NLC had made a profit of Rs 725.92 crore.

Prasad said that during the 10th five-year plan, the Centre will sanction 98 projects costing Rs 6,200 crore. The production capacity of the coal companies will increase by 79 million tonnes once these projects become functional, he said.

The coal ministry had already sanctioned 19 projects worth Rs 1,051 crore since 1999. He said that the CCL, Ranchi, had made a profit of Rs 100 crore during the last financial year.

With regard to the mining sector, Prasad said that the NDA government had allowed foreign equity up to 100 per cent in respect of all minerals. The coal ministry had so far given approval to 65 foreign investment projects worth Rs 4,000 crore.

4,NGO calls for tighter laws on sale of crackers,"MUMBAI: The Loss Prevention Association of India limited (LPA), a non-governmental association has called for stricter laws related to the purchase and lighting of fireworks, including a ban on sale of crackers to children below 15 years of age to prevent injuries during the forthcoming Diwali festival.

According to the organisation, eye injuries, many leading to permanent eye loss, account for nearly 20 per cent of burns caused by fireworks.

Those injured are often below 15 years, many of whom are often innoncent bystanders. Reckless misuse of fireworks, lack of parental supervision and amateur handling of crackers have been major causes of burn injuries among children, an LPA release said.

Pointing out that in the US, fireworks were only sold to personsabove 18 years, the NGO has called for stricter laws in India akin to those in other countries. In the United States, barring a few states, sale of fireworks to the public are limited to sparklers.

The law, however, permits supervised firework displays, under controlled conditions by professionals and fire brigades.

In Canada sparklers and indoor type fireworks are only available to those over 18 who have a certificate of competency to light fireworks while in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, France and Belgium only adults can purchase crackers.

Calling for similar legislation in India, the loss prevention association of Indai has urged the people to take precautionary steps during Diwali, including keeping fireworks in metal containers, not wearing loose clothes, lighting crackers away from fire source and on open grounds.

5,"Corruption hits development work, says Sharad","MADHEPURA: Union minister for food and civil supplies Sharad Yadav has opined that all the construction work in North Bihar should be carried out keeping in view to the recurring flood.

Yadav inaugurated about a dozen newly-completed schemes during his recent visit to the area. The schemes were carried out from the regional development fund allocated to local MP and MLAs.

About the recent â€œstarvation deathsâ€� in Rajasthan, he said a team is probing the matter and the report is yet to come. Yadav said the Central government has allocated Rs 40 crore for foodgrain welfare scheme.

He added that 5,56,000 metric tonnes of rice and 11,64,000 metric tonnes of wheat have also been allotted to the state for the people living below the poverty line. However, the state government has yet to lift the stock, Yadav lamented.

6,MSR gets ready for life after politics,"HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president M Satyanarayana Rao appears to have had enough of politics and is planning the next phase of his life: He has reserved a room in a senior citizensâ€™ home being constructed at Bawrampet on the city outskirts.

â€œI reserved a room for myself in the home. Though my wife is not prepared to go there right now, as our children are looking after us well, who can say if some situation wonâ€™t force us to join the home,â€� the APCC chief said in an emotionchoked voice at the inaugural function of the Vaddepally Narsing Rao Senior Citizensâ€™ Home being constructed by the AP Velama Association.

Rao, however, did not say whether it was political reasons which were driving him to this decision.

When he was invited to speak, Rao literally broke down and said the senior citizensâ€™ home would be his destination after his stint in politics.

â€œThe joint family tradition has long gone. Many old people are suffering for want of proper care even if they have money,â€� he said.

Stating that age was catching up with him, Rao stressed the need for efficient management of such home.

Reminiscing about his days in politics, Rao said that though he had a reputation for being outspoken, even adversaries such as home minister T Devender Goud and major industries minister K Vidyadher Rao â€” both of whom were present at the function â€” liked him.

â€œEven the home ministerâ€™s family likes me as I never hide my feelings,â€� he said, adding in a lighter vein, â€œIf anything, Goud garuâ€™s family complains to him that he says one thing and does another.""

Goud, who spoke next, jocularly complained: â€œThe PCC chief is outspoken and that is why he gets into problems. Take for instance his comments on me. I said something to him in an informal chat and he revealed it to the entire gathering.â€�

7,Release of Sagar water rekindles farmers’ hopes,"GUNTUR: The state governmentâ€™s decision to release water to the Nagarjuna Sagar canals has rekindled the hopes of farmers in the district who had been fighting for the last two months to get water for their crops.

Farmers under Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal area had completed transplantations by the time the government stopped release of water into the canal on September 15.

Sowing operations were completed in nearly 28,000 acres in Macherla, Gurazala, Vinukonda, Narasaraopet, Pedakurapadu, Chilakaluripet and Tadikonda constituencies. The government stopped release of water to canals after issuing 10,000 cusecs as the inflows into the reservoir dwindled.

Due to the drought, farmers who completed the transplantations diverted water meant for drinking purposes by using motors to protect the standing crops. This led to severe drinking water problem in many villages of the district. But, subsequent rains, which the district received in first and second weeks of October, have almost revived the hopes of the farmers on khariff.

8,Farmers to court arrest to protest Cauvery water release,"MANDYA: Threatening to stop release of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, groups of farmers from Mandya district are leaving since Monday morning to the KRS reservoir from where the water is flowing to Tamil Nadu since Sunday night.

Farmers left for the KRS with whatever mode of transport available to them even as the police aided by Rapid Action Force kept a close watch at the dam as also in sensitive places of the district.

Mandya District Farmers Protection Committee leader G Madegowda said that farmers would begin courting arrest against the release of water which was decided by the Karnataka Cabinet on Sunday night.

He said they would decide on the next course of action after the Supreme Court pronounced its final order on Monday.

The Railways have announced suspension of trains between Bangalore and Mysore on Monday as a precautionary measure.

Prohibitory orders are in force in sensitive parts of Mandya and Mysore districts.

14,Will polls ignite communal tinderbox?,"GANDHINAGAR: The Election Commission is taking a closer look at some of the transfers carried out in recent months by the state government, especially those that would have a direct bearing on the conduct of elections, sources said here on Monday.

The sources, working closely with the state''s chief electoral officer, said that the possibility of reinstatement of some of the officials who were shunted out, allegedly because of the ""good handling"" of the postriot situation, could not be ruled out.

""Normally if the EC wants a new official for a particular post, it would ask the government for a panel of two or three names even though it is well within its right to select from outside the panel as well,"" said a source.

An official further said, ""In the backdrop of confrontation between the EC and the government in recent months, it will be interesting to know how the bureaucracy reacts, now that it is relatively free from political control.""

The SPs of Banaskantha, Kutch, Bhavnagar, the Panchmahals and Bharuch were transferred. Similarly, some district collectors, including the Panchmahals collector, were replaced.

Official sources said, ""The EC has been closely monitoring the transfers for a while and can undo some of the state government''s decisions that smack of political prejudice against certain good officials.""

They said that the EC could also review some of the postings of key officials in the districts, including that of SPs and collectors, who are seen to be close to the ruling party.

The EC had begun an elaborate exercise in transferring revenue and police officials, particularly those posted in their home districts or those who spent over four years at one place. Already, 160 mamlatdars have been transferred, 100 of whom were serving at the same place for over four years.

Ten deputy collectors too have been transferred as part of the exercise. A list of transfers of 400 police inspectors is said to be pending with the EC.

The code of conduct that came into force on Monday prohibits the state government from transferring any subordinate official or employee without the consent of the returning officer.

16,'Amlis' face tough time under Cong govt: MP,"MUKTSAR: If Sukhbir Singh Badal, member of parliament, is to be believed then the farmers and â€˜amlisâ€™ (poppy husk addicts) of this area, which is known as the fiefdom of SAD (B) president Parkash Singh Badal, are facing an acute problem since the Congress government took power in the state.

While addressing a gathering of farmers at Gidderbaha at a SAD (B) protest dharna, on Monday, Sukhbir said that the rural area people were happier during the SADBJP regime as the state government always took a very lenient view of power and irrigation thefts by the farmers because of their bad economic conditions.

Also, the drug addicts were not facing any difficulty in indulging in their habits due to the liberal policy of the then government, he added.

But, under the Congress regime, both amlis and kisan brothers were facing a difficult time as the Punjab State Electricity Board authorities and the police were conducting raids in each and every house and were sparing no one, said Sukhbir.

This was one of the many differences between the SAD (B) and Congress government, the member of parliament said while urging the people to get rid of the Congress government in the state.

18,Pre-poll nervousness in riot-hit areas,"AHMEDABAD: A wave of nervous anticipation swept through the riot-affected areas of Ahmedabad on Monday following the announcement of assembly elections in Gujarat.
