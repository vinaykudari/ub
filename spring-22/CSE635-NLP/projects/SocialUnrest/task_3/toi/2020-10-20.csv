0,'Gowda's threat is blackmail politics',"BANGALORE: A day after former prime minister HD Deve Gowda threatened to stage a dharna before Chief Minister SM Krishna''s residence alleging harassment of JD(S) workers by police in Hassan, urban development minister DK Shivakumar on Monday termed it ""blackmail politics"" aimed at maligning home minister Mallikarjun M Kharge.

â€œGowda is known for stooping to such levels. He is unable to digest the fact that Kharge, a scheduled caste leader, is faring well,â€� Shivakumar told reporters here.

Stating that Gowda was attempting to create unrest, Shivakumar maintained that law and order in Hassan was normal. â€œGowdaâ€™s allegations are baseless. The Congress government does not believe in witch-hunting,â€� he added.

He said Gowda has every right to air his grievance. â€œBy raising issues relating to his home district, Gowda has proved he cannot think beyond Hassan,â€� he added.

No objection: Shivakumar maintained that cooperation minister and Mysore district in-charge minister H. Vishwanath had not objected to allotment of land to Adichunchanagiri Math to run an educational institution in Mysore. â€œVishwanath might have expressed his views. But he has not spoken to me,â€� he said.

2,BJP demands all-party meet to discuss Art. 371,"GULBARGA: The BJP demanded the Karnataka government to convene a meeting of all opposition parties and to clarify its stand about asking the Centre to amend Article 371 of the Constitution to develop the Hyderabad-Karnatak region.

Anant Kumar, state unit president of BJP, told reporters that the ambiguity of the state was being a hurdle for the Centre to amend Article 371.

He said that the state had prepared a memorandum in consultation with the opposition asking the Centre to amend the article to provide reservation in education and employment to people of Hyderabad-Karnataka. An all-party team had gone to New Delhi to present it to the prime minister and the deputy prime minister. But, at the last minute an alteration was made to the memorandum and the words â€˜other backward regionsâ€™ were added to the memorandum without consulting the opposition.

The memorandum did not mention which were the other backward regions. This was the chief reason for the Centre not acting in this regard, Anant Kumar alleged. He claimed that the BJP had never mixed politics with welfare.

On the Jana Sangharsha Yatra which will conclude at Bidar on Tuesday, Kumar said that it had received a tremendous response. He alleged that the people were angry with the state for its anti-people policies and were disappointed with the Janata Parivar too.

He said, the executive committee meeting of the BJP, to be held at Bangalore on October 22, will decide whether to continue with the Jana Sangharsha Yatra or not.

He said that the BJP will hold a massive rally in Bidar on Tuesday, the last day of the Jana Sangharsha Yatra and demand that the government hand over the stamp paper scam and the Nagappa killing cases to the CBI.

On irrigation projects in North Karnataka, Kumar held all previous governments responsible for the delay in completing the projects. Though the height of Alamatti Dam was raised to impound Krishna water, the government failed to distribute the water as the canals were not ready.

Kumar alleged that the chief minister faced opposition with regard to drought-relief works from his own party members like Jaffer Sharief, Vishwanath and Bangarappa.

3,UT admn amends booth allotment rules,"CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has amended the 1991 rules governing the allotment and transfer of booths to the effect that allotment of booths shall be made to the eligible applicants through draw of lots and refusal of an individual to participate in the draw or to accept allotment would render him ineligible for further allotment.

With the new amendment, failure to utilise the booth for the purpose for which it was allotted within a time frame of six months from the date of offer of possession shall amount to breach of conditions of lease and the lease would be liable to get cancelled on this ground.

The administration has also amended the Allotment/Transfer of Built up Booths on Leasehold Basis in Chandigarh Scheme of 1993 to the same effect. Besides, in addition to the payment of 25 per cent premium, the remaining 75 per cent shall be recoverable in three equated, yearly installments along with the prescribed rate of interest.

In case of delay in payment, interest on delayed payments would be chargeable at the rate specified in Chandigarh Leasehold of Sites and Buildings Rules of 1973.

4,Metro opens wholesale outlet amidst protests,"BANGALORE: Foodgrains, vegetables, meats, wine, garments, packaged goods, household items...Metro Cash and Carry Distribution Centre promises 17,500 items at its outlet here.

Metro''s ultramodern store, spread over 6,500 sqm at Yeshwantpur and inaugurated by mayor CM Nagaraj, hopes to give ''wholesale'' a whole new meaning â€” that of registered businesses, corporates and retailers buying goods for retail sale.

This has sparked off discontent in the APMC, as Metro is the first wholesale setup selling agricultural produce outside the APMC, in contravention of the Karnataka APMC Act. This has also led to confusion over whether Metro is a wholesale or retail operation. Traders have alleged that Metro is selling goods below the cost price, and is also issuing cards to individuals.

At the inaugural, Metro Cash and Carry India managing director Harsh Bahadur attempted to clear some confusion. â€œAs against the APMC Act, we are not based within the specified market yard but have got a licence to trade from the government. We have been promised that the law will be amended, although no timeframe was specified,â€™â€™ Bahadur said. He clarified it will not have independent transactions with employees of corporates which are Metro members.

â€œOnly registered businesses are enrolled and we give out only 1.3 member cards per business customer. A member buys goods after signing a contract saying that whatever he buys will be only for business needs,â€™â€™ Bahadur emphasised. Metro denied having any kind of entry pricing strategy.

Metro Cash and Carry sources 90 per cent of products locally and 10 per cent is imported. Prices are cheaper than at other wholesalers. â€œThat is good for retailers, who can price our products cheaper for the end consumer. Eventually, the whole supply chain can be revolutionised,â€™â€™ Bahadur said. But there are no guarantees: for the consumer, there may well be no tangible cost difference, as Metro does not take the responsibility of pricing in the retail market.

The Germany-based group, with trade in 26 countries, will inaugurate another outlet on Kanakapura Road on November 13. This is expected to employ 750 locals and create 1,300 more jobs.

6,Naidu keeps mum on early elections,"HYDERABAD: The chief minister convened meetings of two decision-making bodies of the TDP â€” the politburo and the state executive on Monday, but did not mention a word on advancing elections in the state.

However, Chandrababu Naidu dropped enough hints to the party cadre on the issue. In the coming fortnight, he said, the TDP will conduct massive public meetings across the state. The meeting will be held in Karimnagar, Rajahmundry and Kurnool and finally at Hyderabad. For the record, the party said the meetings were being organised to create a peopleâ€™s movement against extremism and to condemn the recent attack on Chandrababu Naidu at Tirumala.

But, since 1994, TDPâ€™s region-wise meetings have culminated in a massive programme in Hyderabad. These have incidentally taken place always months before the elections to the Assembly.

7,Ranjan launches a new party,"PATNA: After remaining more than a year in political hibernation, the former ""friend, philosopher and guide"" of RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, Ranjan Prasad Yadav, launched a new political party on Monday christening it as ""Sampurna Vikas Dal"".

""I apologise to the people for being part of such political parties which made false promises regarding the development of the downtrodden,"" Ranjan said at a press conference here without naming Laloo. He promised that the new party, which has been registered by the Election Commission, would fight both the RJD and the NDA.

Known political leaders other than former CPI MP from Jehanabad Ramashray Prasad Singh were conspicuous by their absence on the occasion of launching of the new party. However, Ranjan insisted that several RJD MLAs are still with him and that they would come out in the open at the ""right time"".

Laloo dubbed Ranjanâ€™s move as politically insignificant. ""Ranjan Yadav is a mosquito. He will remain confined to Churi Gali (the lane in which Ranjanâ€™s home is located in Patna),"" remarked Laloo.

Without naming Laloo, Ranjan lashed out at his 13-year-old regime, saying that its legacy is lack of development, illiteracy, poverty, corruption, looting of government funds, violence and anarchy.

""The irony is that those people who had sworn that the bifurcation of Bihar would take place over their dead bodies have not only split the state but have also established a family rule in the state through dubious means,"" he maintained.

He said persons on the top of the power structure have no concern or vision for development.

""If someone asks me about any development in Bihar during the last 13 years, I will say that there has been development in extortion, kidnapping and killing,"" he observed.

Ranjan said the judiciary has to intervene even for payment of salary to employees and removal of garbage. ""But this government has no shame and ignores even court orders,"" he added.

He said more than two lakh vacancies in government offices were identified at the high-level meeting presided over by the chief secretary on January 29, 2003. ""But why have the appointments not been made?"" he asked.

He said when the regime came to power the Bihar Public Service Commission had held 39 competitive exams for appointment of grade II employees. But during the last 13 years, only six competitive exams have been held. People of all classes have lost faith in the present government. They should take a vow to remove this government, he maintained.

Ranjan accused the NDA and the RJD of having a nexus. He said Presidentâ€™s rule in the state was revoked on the pretext that the NDA did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. Now, the NDA has a majority in the House. Then why is Presidentâ€™s rule not being imposed? he asked. He also accused the Vajpayee government at the Centre of encouraging communal forces and failing to remove unemployment and poverty.

8,Krishna warns against communal violence,"BANGALORE: Sounding a warning bell to communal forces, chief minister S M Krishna on Tuesday asserted that his government will mercilessly put down any effort to create division of society on religious lines.

""Destructive forces are working overtime to make inroad into states where there is communal harmony. The Congress government, which believes in secularism, will not tolerate such activities,"" he said delivering the inaugural address of the conference of National Commission of Minorities here.

Without naming any party or organisation, Krishna pointed out that communal violence had become a way of life to some people.

""They try to create mutual distrust and gain a foothold in a particular region. They attempt to divide society on communal and religion lines,"" he stated.

Noting that Karnataka had largely remained peaceful, Krishna expressed concern over the developments in North Indian states.

""We cannot remain complacent. We should never fall prey to their evil designs,"" he added.

9,By-polls to be litmus test for SP,"LUCKNOW: The by-elections to the Harora (Saharanpur) and Mahsi (Bahraich) constituencies are being perceived as the first litmus test for the Samajwadi Party led government in Uttar Pradesh.

By-polls to the two constituencies are scheduled for November 20.

Harora, a reserved seat had fallen vacant following the resignation of former chief minister and BSP president Mayawati while the Mahsi seat had fallen vacant following the death of the sitting BSP MLA Ali Bahadur.

While deliberations are still being held amongst the other political parties on the candidates to be fielded by them the Samajwadi Party has been the first to announce the candidates.

The party has repeated both its candidates - Vimla Rakesh is the SP''s candidate from Harora, Dilip Verma has been given the ticket for Mahsi.

Vimla, who had won from the Harora seat two times earlier is being perceived as a force to reckon with.

Though the victory of margins between her and Mayawati was considerable (against her 41900 votes Mayawati had polled 70800 votes) in the last assembly elections, her candidature in the changed political set up is not being taken lightly by her rivals also.

Harora, has a sizeable section of Scheduled Caste population which accounts for it being given the ''reserved seat'' status.

Also present in considerable strength here are Muslims, Gujjars etc. The constituency however has never been perceived as the ''home turf'' of any particular political party.

States an SP leader ""we have a strong candidate in the constituency and there is no reason why she would not fare well"". He held near similar views on the Mahsi seat.

Falling in the general category Mahsi has a good representation of Brahmins, Thakurs and Muslims. Also present in sizeable section here are the Backwards comprising Lodhs, Kurmis, Yadavs and the rest.

It is this caste combination which determines the choice of the candidate in Mahsi. The SP has fielded a Kurmi.

""We are assured of not only the BC votes but also of the upper caste and the Muslims"" opined the SP leader.

While the other political parties are yet to open their cards vis a vis the choice of candidates the Congress and the BJP are expected to announce the names in a couple of days.

BJP spokesman Hirday Narain Dixit stated that the state election committee had ""vested all rights on this count with the state president Vinay Katiyar. The latter after consulting the party''s central parliamentary board will make the announcement soon.""

Congress party spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh said discussions on the candidate''s name for Harora had been held in Delhi on Monday and deliberations for the Mahsi candidate will take place in the next couple of day.

The BSP which had held both the seats has also yet not announced its candidates. Also worth watching is whether the allies of the rainbow coalition, particularly the Rashtriya Kranti Dal of Kalyan Singh and the Rashtriya Lok Dal of Ajit Singh would be fielding any candidate and whether in these circumstances the contest may well end as a ''friendly one''.

RLD MLC Munna Singh Chauhan said the party had decided against fielding any candidate in Harora.

It will be holding a meeting in Mahsi on Wednesday and depending on the response it may or may not field a candidate there.

12,Oppn to launch post Ramzan protest against Musharraf,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan''s Opposition parties, including the Islamist alliance, Muthahida Majlis Amal, have announced a fresh agitation against President Pervez Musharraf after the Muslim holy month of Ramazan.

13,Panel for service rules of jathedars,"AMRITSAR: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has constituted a 21-member committee that would scrutinise the cases presented before Akal Takht informed honorary secretary of SGPC, Manjit Singh Calcutta while talking to media persons on Tuesday.

Calcutta said the committee, which he termed as Religious Advisory Board, had been constituted only on receiving directions from Akal Takht following which the Dharam Parchar Committee of SGPC decided to constitute the committee in its meeting held on October 10 at Fatehgarh Sahib. Calcutta also claimed that all members except he himself and Bhaur were of non-political background.

Calcutta said the committee would form the service rules for the appointment, removals and areas of jurisdiction for the granthis and jathedars of Takhts . The committee would aid and assist jathedar of Akal Takht.

Strangely , president of committee Gurcharan Singh Tohra, only a few days back had stated that removal and appointment of jathedars was a non issue -- which was being also raised by the supporters of Gurbax Singh Kala Afghana.

Asked whether the committee would also contemplate over the cases pending before Akal Takht regarding alleged violation of maryada by Parkash Singh Badal and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, Calcutta hesitantly replied that committee would deal into all kind of cases.

However, he made it clear that Jathedar himself could take suo motto notice of any issue by himself and decide on the same.

He said the issues would first be contemplated by the above committee and efforts would be made to resolve them at very first step and if not, they would be recommended to jathedar of Akal Takht for final decision.

Calcutta claimed that the decisions of committee would neither be binding on jathedar nor the committee, in any way, would have its influence over issuance of Hukamnamaâ€™s thus maintain the individual, independent authority of jathedars.

Calcutta said that the committee would meet at least four times in a year and it was yet to be decided about its first meeting. Asked about meeting the travel expenses of members coming from UK or USA ""none of the member would ask for the air fare"" replied Calcutta.

He also hailed the decision of central government for barring Sehjdharis from voting in the Gurdwara elections. He alleged that a large number of Muslim and other non-Sikhs had invaded Gurdwaraâ€™s under the garb of Sehjdhari Sikhs.

14,"Robbers still rule: NRI, courier newest victims","AHMEDABAD: Making a mockery of the Gujarat Police''s plan of action to curb property crime, a gang of four robbed an angadia at Paldi on Tuesday morning and decamped with Rs 3.72 lakh worth of silver ornaments, diamonds and cash in a Maruti car.

This robbery, like the break-in on Monday in the Bopal area of Ahmedabad at the residence of former Madhavpura bank chairman Ramesh Parikh, happened around 5.45 am and the accused have been described as four persons around 30-35 years of age, armed with swords and hockey sticks.

In a separate incident in Dabhoi on Monday, an NRI, Raj Kumar, was stripped of his US passport, visa documents and other valuables worth Rs 5 lakh when his briefcase was stolen in a state transport bus.

Kumar told TNN that he had gone to Karnali in Narmada district with his wife Gita and when they were returning, they discovered that the briefcase was stolen.

The bag contained Kumar''s passport (159018853), $2,200, $1,200 in American Express traveller''s cheques, driving licence, social security card, jewellery and other papers.

In Tuesday''s case, a complaint was lodged by Hitesh Mehta, who runs a courier agency in the Ratanpol area of the Walled City. According to him, the accused came in a Maruti car (GBL 9384) and threatened his men. They decamped with bags belonging to three angadia services.

In the Ramesh Parikh case, four intruders armed with country-made pistols stole gold, cash -- all worth Rs 1.70 lakh -- and drove off in his Santro.

They forced themselves into his bungalow and threatened his family saying, ""Give us all you have, you have earned enough from the Madhavpura bank!"" Parikh is in judicial custody in the multi-crore MMCB scam. The complaint lodged by his son, Vineet Parikh, stated that the intruders were aged around 30-35 years and were speaking in Hindi.

Tuesday''s will be the fourth such case in Ahmedabad and the tenth in Gujarat in the last two weeks after similar cases in Surat, Vapi and Vadodara. Not a single accused has been caught.

15,Custody death sparks riot,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Policeâ€™s effort at cracking down on Diwali-eve gambling had tragic consequences on Monday night when a raiding party allegedly beat to death Sushil Kumar, a 32-year-old PCO operator at Madipur in the Punjabi Bagh area.

Sushilâ€™s death resulted in large-scale rioting in the area in a matter of hours. Angry residents took on the police, and in the early hours of Tuesday, a couple of pitched battles ended up in the riot squad being called out. Mobs went around pelting stones at the police, burning vehicles and blocking traffic.

According to Sushilâ€™s relatives, five policemen picked him up from his house at 11 pm on Monday, claiming he had tipped off some gamblers about a police raid. Kumar was kept at a nearby police post for over two hours, where he was allegedly bashed up. When he was dropped home, Kumar complained of giddiness and pain in stomach. He was immediately moved to the Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The preliminary autopsy confirms he died of internal injuries.

Kumarâ€™s case has opened a can of worms. There have been complaints of police high-handedness during the Diwali season. Revellers allege that the police go on an overdrive during Diwali to earn fast bucks.

Criminal lawyer Ashish Bhagat says, â€˜â€˜It might be true that gambling increases during Diwali. But it is untrue that all such cases come under the purview of the Public Gambling Act.â€™â€™ The Delhi Police have registered 1,138 cases under the Public Gambling Act this year. Till October last year, they had registered 1,021 case.

A senior police officer admitted that the drive against gambling has become a source of easy money for policemen. â€˜â€˜A fortnight before Diwali is considered to be the most lucrative time to extort money. Itâ€™s easy for junior police personnel to get permission from the DCP to raid almost any place on the pretext of controlling gambling,â€™â€™ says the officer.

Itâ€™s not just money, though. â€˜â€˜There have been incidents when people have been rounded up just because a particular policeman had an axe to grind. All this is done on the pretext of controlling gambling,â€™â€™ he says. The Public Gambling Act of 1867 gives legal validity to gamblers until it is made a business to earn a profit or a commission. Gambling is also an offence if conducted in public places.

Five suspended

Five policemen, including an assistant sub inspector, were suspended on Tuesday following the death of Sushil Kumar. A case of murder has been registered against them and an SDM probe ordered. The matter has been referred to the NHRC.

16,'Govt accounts had no money to pay the riot-hit',"AHMEDABAD: Deposing before the Nanavati-Shah Commission on Tuesday, a riot victim said that many of the cheques issued by the government as compensation could not be encashed due to paucity of funds in the government accounts.

Zafar Ajmeri, the organiser of a relief camp for riot victims at Dani Limda, deposed before the commission that when victims went to the bank to get their cheques encashed, they were told by officials that the account was short of money.

Even cheques with amounts as low as Rs 3,000 were turned down, he said.

Former Congress minister Girish Parmar and former member of the legislative assembly Gunwant Makwana, however, praised the police for handling the riot situation in the area.

Most of the 38 deponents lauded efforts of the police in maintaining law and order in their areas. Another deponent Kasturbhai said that workers of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad had raised provocative slogans to cause unrest among residents.

He condemned the police for not taking action against workers trying to create tension after the Godhra incident. Condemning the police, Imran Sheikh said they stood their ground when his shop was completely destroyed and looted by a mob on March 1.

The Dani Limda police even refused to register a complaint about the incident for over fifteen days and later booked him under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA) and sent him to a Junagadh jail.

He also alleged that an inspector by the surname Solanki of the Dani Limda police station had beaten him up brutally.

17,Khedut samiti gives ultimatum to govt,"AHMEDABAD: Rejecting the governmentâ€™s recent rollback in power tariff, the Gujarat Khedut Sangharsh Samiti on Tuesday warned the BJP regime of a renewed agitation if status quo in power tariff was not restored by October 31.

Demanding a shift to older rates, senior functionaries of the Samiti in their meeting held under the chairmanship of Bipin Desai said that the relief announced to the farmers was meagre and the Samiti, under no circumstances, will accept it.

Addressing a news conference after the farmersâ€™ meeting here on Tuesday, Desai said the government should stall the implementation of the new rates and invite the Samiti and other organisations like the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh to find a solution for the vexed issue.

He demanded the government should also lower the irrigation cess as farmers were not in a position to pay the exorbitant charges for irrigation, which were revised by the Modi government recently.

Meanwhile, the Samiti has decided to join hands with the BKS, known to have given a tough fight to the government over issues concerning farmers in the state, he added.

On whether the Samiti would also join the agitations announced by the BKS, Desai said it was not possible till they sit across the table and explore the possibility of forging unity among farmers.

""We are prepared to support BKS if they show their willingness to launch programmes from a common platform,"" he said. But the Samiti has already communicated to the farmers not to pay the electricity bills and the increased cess on irrigation till the issues were settled, he informed.

Though some of the representatives in Tuesdayâ€™s meeting rejected Desaiâ€™s move of extending support to the BKS, the Samiti has decided to approach BKS and forge unity in order to pressurise the government before was too late.

Desai also said that soon after Diwali the farmers would re-start their plan of gheraoing MLAs and MPs of their areas and will also prevent revenue staff of GEB and irrigation department from entering their villages for recovery dues.

It was surprising that the government has not given any assurance over regular supply power to farm sector as farmers have suffered heavy losses following erratic supply in north Gujarat districts, he said adding more than 150 electric motors have failed due to the erratic power supply to farmers.
