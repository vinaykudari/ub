1,‘SIT report on Telgi scam is the DF govt’s epitaph’,"MUMBAI: The Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s handsome poll victories in three states has triggered worries in the Congress-led DF coalition whether the BJP blitzkrieg will strike Maharashtra too, given the state governmentâ€™s performance and the burgeoning scamsâ€” the Telgi tehelka, for instance.

â€œThe SITâ€™s inquiry reports on the Telgi scam should be read as the DF governmentâ€™s epitaph,â€™â€™ said a key Mantralaya bureaucrat.

Contrast the mess in the DF with the serene 1960s and â€˜70s when Maharashtraâ€™s politics was marked by consensus and pragmatism, thanks to the political savvy and managerial skills of Congress stalwarts such as Y.B. Chavan, Vasantdada Patil and Sharad Pawar, who kept groupism under control.

Contrast this with the DF,which is today rent with acrimony. Neither the Congress nor the NCP seems to have learnt the basics of coalition politics.

Little wonder that state cabinet meetings are often stormy and prominent Congress and NCP functionaries routinely rubbish each other in the press. The recently concluded legislative council elections have brought to the fore the groupism within the Congress party as also worsening Congress-NCP ties.

â€œSuch spats have alarmed the rank and file of the two parties. Itâ€™s time the DF allies get their act together. The BJPâ€™s poll triumph is a â€˜wake-up callâ€™.

The Congress and the NCP should exercise restraint. Moreover, we should tell people about the DFâ€™s good projects and programmes,â€™â€™ said Mumbai NCP president and MLA Sachin Ahir.

The rub lies here. Given the Congress-NCPâ€™s worsening equations, the DF strategistsâ€™ dilemma is how to refurbish the state governmentâ€™s image. Said a senior Congress minister, â€œMaharashtraâ€™s total investment in infrastructure, industry and the service sector is estimated at about $35 billion.

The state continues to be the countryâ€™s economic powerhouse. But we have done very little to market our achievementsâ€”for instance, the special economic zones, the IT boom and the Mumbai-Pune-Nashik Golden Triangle or the Right to Information Act.â€™â€™

Meanwhile, fresh efforts have begun both in the Congress and the NCP to finalise a pre-poll alliance in a bid to stop the BJP bazooka from aiming at the state. Following the BJPâ€™s three big wins, the DF think-tank seems to have woken up to RSS Incâ€™s formidable network of â€˜pracharaksâ€™, the bulk of whom belongs to Maharashtra.

Whether the BJP swoops down the Vindhyas or not depends on the DFâ€™s ability, or lack of it, to learn from its Himalayan blunders.

3,Naga shadow over Karbi-Kuki clashes,"KOLKATA: Shadows of Nagaland militant groups loom over the Karbi-Kuki clashes in the Karbi Anglong district in Assam.

Common people have been drawn into the conflict that started more than a month ago by the Kuki Revolutionary Army and the United Peoples Democratic Solidarity, M.P. Jayanta Rongpi, former Autonomous State Demand Committee leader who is now with the CPI-M(L), said on Thursday, while speaking to the TNN over the telephone from Diphu.

Jayanta Rongpi disagreed with the view of security force sources in Kolkata that there was a plan to drive out Karbis from Karbi Anglong so that the demand for a greater Nagaland could be strengthened. For the record, militant groups in Nagaland had demanded that areas in Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh be included into a â€œgreater Nagalimâ€�.

Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee during his recent visit to Nagaland had, however, ruled out such a possibility. Rongpi said both the KRA and the UPDS were getting the benefit of firearms at the disposal of militant groups in Nagaland.

Guns fell silent in Nagaland since the ceasefire agreement between the Centre and the two factions of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland. But militants have a habit of lending out their weapons when not in use, to collect money.

Rongpi said the clashes are centred in the Singhasan-Khonbagong hill range, bordering on the Kaziranga National Park. The trouble began in the 1980s when Kukis fled in the wake of Naga-Kuki clashes in Manipur and settled in the forest tract of the hill range. Nearly 15,000 Kukis and 35,000 Karbis had settled.

In 2000, when Kukis at Singhasan organised themselves into a political entity and gave it the appearence of a hill council, the trouble began, he said. According to Rongpi, it was shortsighted on the ASDCâ€™s part, the predominant political party in Karbi Anglong, to have agreed to the formation of this entity.

This encouraged the KRA to start demanding taxes from residents of the area, arguing that it was now theirâ€™s. The UPDS came forward to defend the Karbis.

Things went beyond control when KRA cadres attacked the Thekerjan village on October 30 alleging that villagers had kidnapped four of them.

4,Lyngdoh prefers central rule to caretaker govt,"HYDERABAD: Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh on Saturday remained tightlipped on when he would schedule polls to the Andhra Pradesh Assembly, but suggested that central rule was probably a better option than a caretaker government till such time as elections were held.

Delivering lecture organised by the Institute of Asian Studies here, he said: â€œI personally feel that Presidentâ€™s rule is a better option than a caretaker government. But with politicians as governors, even that is fraught with the inherent danger of one person having total control of the administration. Still, I feel the central rule option is better.â€�

Reacting to a suggestion from the audience not to hold elections in March, for they clash with the examination season, he said the Election Commission would keep that in mind while announcing the schedule. To a pointed question on when exactly the state could go to the polls, he said he too really didnâ€™t know. â€œProbably, my successor will decide.â€�

Later, when reporters grilled him further on whether he would announce the notification by February 28, the day of his retirement, Lyngdoh laughed and said: â€œI am here on a private visit.â€� Probably to drive home his point, the CEC arrived at the Telugu University auditorium in a private car. His security detail and personal staff were not with him.

The CEC, however, said that until an election notification was issued, the commission could do nothing to stop the caretaker governmentâ€™s sop fest. â€œIf we interfere, people say the EC has turned autocratic, undemocratic

â€œI feel that Presidentâ€™s rule is a better option than a caretaker government. â€™â€™

5,SC lambasts Centre for withdrawing anti-Sikh riot cases,"NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to a Delhi Police decision to withdraw a 1984 anti-Sikh riot case, the Supreme Court has lambasted the Centre saying on one hand it was appointing commission after commission to go into the riots and on the other it was trying to withdraw cases.

""What is this - on one hand you go on appointing commission after commission to probe the riots and on the other you withdraw the case registered by police,"" a Bench, comprising Justice S Rajendra Babu and Justice G P Mathur, said on Friday dismissing an appeal filed by Delhi Police commissioner.

The appeal was filed challenging a Delhi High Court order which had set aside a trial court order allowing prosecution to close an anti-Sikh riot case, in which it was alleged that supporters of Congress leader Haracharan Singh Josh had allegedly fired in the aftermath of the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi resulting in the death of a person.

The police, which came under the control of the Union home ministry, contended that a high-level committee headed by the home secretary had taken a decision in 1989 to withdraw certain cases.

It was contended before the apex court that it would help maintaining the communal amity in the city and such cases which were old and no substantial evidence was available on record should be withdrawn.

This angered the Bench, which observed ""somebody has committed a murder and you are saying that you will not prosecute him on the ground that it will help maintain communal harmony?""

The Centre has so far appointed Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission, Jain-Banerjee Commission and now Justice G T Nanavati Commission to probe into the riots.

Referring to this, the Bench said the Centre was appointing commission after commission to probe the riots and here is the decision to withdraw a riot case.

""This is a perfect example of proverb ''rock the cradle and pinch the baby'' policy. You rock the cradle when the baby is crying and when the baby stops crying, you pinch it to make it cry,"" the Bench observed.

When the Bench said it would not interfere with the high court order setting aside the trial court''s decision to accept the prosecutor''s plea to close the riot case, Additional Solicitor General R N Trivedi said the high court had observed that the application for closure of the case was made by the prosecutor without applying his mind.

Trivedi said let the prosecutor apply his mind afresh and if a case of closure was made out on merit he should be given the liberty to file a fresh application in that regard.

The Bench, while dismissing the appeal filed by the commissioner of police, said the option of fresh closure application was always available to the prosecutor.

6,"Police say it is suicide, wife cries murder","NEW DELHI: In an unusual case, the wife of a west Delhi businessman has been accused of abetting her husbandâ€™s suicide.

The woman on her part, has alleged that her husband was murdered. The high court has now transferred the probe to the crime branch.

The businessman, Trilochan Singh had been found dead in his Vishnu Garden residence on June 3 this year. He had been married to Amarjeet Kaur for 20 years. The couple had two grown-up children.

The wife and the two kids were not living with Singh when he died. Twenty days before his death, she was turned out of the house and went to live with her parents.

Amarjeet had reported this to the police, after which, Singh was arrested on May 16 for breach of peace. He was later released on bail. A week earlier too, Singh had been arrested following an altercation with his wife.

Meanwhile, Amarjeet filed a civil suit before a city court on May 20, praying that her husband be restrained from disposing the properties. A notice was issued to Singh.

A week later, Singh filed a petition for divorce.

The Tilak Nagar police registered a case of abetment to suicide against Amarjeet Kaur on the complaint of Trilochan Singhâ€™s brother Charanjeet Singh. In September, Amarjeet approached the Delhi High Court, which stayed her arrest in the case.

In October, Amarjeet petitioned the HC for quashing of the FIR against her and alleged that the police was not investigating what looked like a murder.

Counsel for the accused, R N Mittal, told the court that Trilochan Singh was last seen on the night before his death, with Charanjeet Singh and his cousin Manmohan Singh.
