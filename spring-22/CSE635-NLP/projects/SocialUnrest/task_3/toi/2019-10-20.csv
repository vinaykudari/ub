0,Who will benefit from Thackeray’s arrest?,"MUMBAI: While the burra sahibs of Mantralaya, the state government headquarters, are going through the Indian Penal Code with a fine-tooth comb, the Congress-led Democratic Front governmentâ€™s latest move to arrest Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray for â€œinciting communal disharmonyâ€� could well turn into a long-drawn soap-opera with a string of sub-plots.

For instance, the state Congress is as much keen on getting even with Thackeray as with its power-sharing partner, the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party, say political observers.

The Congress-NCP ties have for long been strained and the person who is in charge of the home department, which will take the Thackeray case to its logical end, is deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, the NCPâ€™s most vociferous leader in the state.

Should Thackeray be clapped in prison the state Congress will flaunt the conviction as the DF governmentâ€™s victory. Conversely, let Bhujbal bear the brunt in case the court pronounces, as it did in July 2000, Thackeray â€˜not guiltyâ€™. â€œItâ€™s a win-win situation for us,â€� said a senior Congress leader.

However, the Congress had its compulsions too in the Thackeray case.

Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh was instructed by the party high command to go ahead with the legal process against the Sena chief. In New Delhi, Congress spokesperson Jaipal Reddy had a tough time pacifying a hostile media which grilled him for the â€œinactionâ€� of the Congress government to tame Thackeray.

An interesting interlude to the high political drama was Thackerayâ€™s studied silence on Bhujbal. Addressing a press conference at his Bandra residence on Friday, Thackeray did not utter a word against his bete noir.

Instead, Thackeray came down heavily on Deshmukh for taking a personal interest in the matter of his arrest.

Is Thackeray going soft on Bhujbal? â€œIt would be too early to draw any inference. But isnâ€™t it interesting that Bhujbal too has been displaying remarkable restraint while speaking about his mentor,â€� a senior Sena functionary pointed out.

Thackerayâ€™s Dassera speech has a few lessons for the BJP too, say Sena watchers. For over a year, Thackeray has been singling out Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee for unbridled criticism laced with sarcasm. However, deputy prime minister L.K. Advani receives no such special treatment from Thackeray.

â€œBalasaheb shares excellent equations with Advani. The friendship dates back to the 1989 rath-yatra of Advani. In fact, before the BJP assumed power at the Centre, Advani used to periodically visit Thackerayâ€™s Bandra residence. The Vajpayee-Thackeray equations have always been formal,â€™â€™ said a Sena functionary.

Is Thackerayâ€™s criticism of Vajpayee a post-script to the on-going power struggle in the BJP? Is Thackeray making it amply clear to Advani that the Sena would back him in case of change of guard in New Delhi?

Meanwhile, two days after the Shivaji Park police station registered an offence against Thackeray under section 153(A) of the IPC, doubts are being raised in the state administration about the possible fallout of the Sena chief â€™s arrest.

â€œProving an offence under section 153(A) is a pretty tough task. The rate of conviction under the section is nearly nil,â€� a key Mantralay official told TNN on Saturday. Moreover, the state administration is suspicious if the DF coalition will flex its political muscle to bring the Big B from Bandra to book.

1,"Mumbai’s spirit largely outweighs its inconveniences, say expats","MUMBAI: Mumbai and Delhi are the among the worst cities in the world for expatriates to live in, while Melbourne and Vancouver are the best. So says a new study by the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the business information arm of the Economist group.

The survey,which measured the broad social and economic hardships faced by expatriates in 130 cities, ranked Mumbai 124 and Delhi 121. Karachi and Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, were at the bottom of the heap at 129 and 130 respectively. The EIU devised the rankings after looking at 12 factors, including health and safety, threat of violent crime, climate and environment, education, culture and infrastructure and corruption.

Karachi got the second-highest hardship rating of 74 per cent, while New Delhi and Mumbai got 62 per cent and 57 per cent. The Indonesian capital Jakarta polled 56 per cent, Bangkok scored 45 per cent, Manila 47 per cent, Colombo 52 per cent, Hanoi 54 per cent, Ho Chi Minh 55 per cent, Phnom Penh 70 per cent and Dhaka 71 per cent.

The EIU recommended a hardship allowance of ten per cent of the salaries of expatriates living in cities with a rating of â€œsevereâ€™â€™ hardship (36 per cent to 50 per cent), and a 20 per cent allowance for cities with a rating of extreme hardship (more than 50 per cent).

But do our expats really find Mumbai a hardship posting? Quite the contrary.

Ask Aloise Price, wife of Dominic Price, managing director of J.P. Morgan, and mother of three. â€œIâ€™m astonished. I wonder if anyone actually visited the 130 cities in order to make the comparison, or whether this was simply an imagined comparison uninformed by personal experience,â€™â€™ she said. â€œGiven a choice of the 130 cities assessed as a destination to live and to bring up my young children, Mumbai would rank right up there. One does need to have a positive attitude and some imagination, but to those armed with these two, an expatriate life in Mumbai is colourful, exciting, invigorating and a better alternative to many others.â€™â€™

Ms Price adds, â€œHow many other cities provide not only the educational opportunities for expatriates and their children that Mumbai does, but also an invaluable domestic support system which enables them to fully appreciate those opportunities? The flexibility of having someone else to take care of domestic chores adds a dimension that deserves far greater weight than it probably got in the survey. Recreational options may not be as neat and prepackaged as they are in many of the cities that scored higher, but with a little imagination, there are a multitude of things to do here. Moreover, the friendliness and welcoming attitude of the Mumbaiites we are privileged to know must rank right up at the top versus most cities, and certainly with our own back home.â€™â€™

Australian consular officer Renee Jarvis, who came in early this year from Melbourne (a steep fall from No 1 to No 124), thinks so too. â€œI feel at home here because Indians are as friendly and welcoming as Australians,â€™â€™ Ms Jarvis said.

â€œOf course,Mumbai is not as easy as Melbourne. Housingâ€™s a lot more expensive. One spends a lot more time commuting here, the traffic congestionâ€™s awful. Thereâ€™s less access to parks and beaches, less time for friends and outdoor activities. But the place is so vibrant that one can live with the pinpricks.â€™â€™

Yes, indeed, agrees Swiss consul Joseph Koch, a son-in-law of the soil. â€œThe climateâ€™s bad, the pollutionâ€™s worse, housingâ€™s costly, cello teachers arenâ€™t easy to come by. And the German School couldnâ€™t take my 13-year-old twins in because they would have been the only ones in the sixth grade. So, the kids had to join the American School and switch to studying in English, which isnâ€™t easy even if their mother is Indian,â€™â€™ grumbled Mr Koch. â€œBut one factor makes up for all these irritants â€”the spirit of Bombay. â€œThis city is very alive, very energising.. quite unlike Karachi, where we went to party after party but had absolutely no cultural life.â€™â€™

And what about this â€˜hardship allowanceâ€™for places like Mumbai, Delhi and Karachi? Ridiculous, said many expats, â€œexcept perhaps if the company isnâ€™t picking up your rent,â€™â€™ clarified one. â€œI find little hardship here,â€™â€™ declared British businessman and Yacht Club regular Graham Tullet, an ex-soldier who spends half his time in Mumbai. â€œIn fact, some services are far better in India than they are in England, like health, for instance. The National Health Service in England has gone down the tube. So, when I need treatment of any sort, I ha ve it done in India.â€™â€™

â€œThatâ€™s right,â€™â€™ chipped in Ms Price. â€œSome of my fellow country folk abandon their National Health Service waiting lists in the UK to have their ills attended to quickly, efficiently and at negligible cost here in India. Whether for dental treatment, laser surgery for myopia or plastic surgery, itâ€™s all available here in Mumbai at world-class standards and budget prices. I wonder how many go to other cities for treatment in preference to their own?â€™â€™

2,Cong committed to providing free power to farmers,"HYDERABAD: The state Congress executive committee on Saturday stopped short of passing a resolution on free power to farmers, but reiterated its commitment on the matter.

It decided to seek the high commandâ€™s approval on the issue at an appropriate time.

After the four-and-a-half hour session, PCC spokesperson K Rosaiah said there was no difference of opinion within the party on the issue. He, however, clarified the final call on including the pledge in the election manifesto would be taken at an appropriate time.

He rejected newspaper reports claiming the party high command had directed the state unit not to pass a resolution on the issue.

Asked whether the Congress was going back on its promise by not passing such a resolution, Rosaiah said party leaders unanimously favoured giving free power to farmers, but the executive meeting was not the forum to pass such a resolution.

However, party insiders said some senior leaders such as J C Divakar Reddy and M A Khan cautioned the state leadership to work out the financial implications of the scheme before giving the electorate any commitment.

They urged the state leadership to do nothing to embarrass the high command.

3,Meet for increasing rabi production,"PATNA: The one-day state-level conference on rabi crops concluded here on Friday with a thrust on increasing rabi production to compensate the loss suffered by the kharif crops due to flood in north and drought in south Bihar.

In the booklet released by the agriculture directorate on the occasion, it was stated that to compensate the loss, 38 lakh hectares has been earmarked for the coverage by rabi crops with the production target of 67.10 lakh MT. For the kharif season, the expected foodgrain production of the state for 2001-2002 was 115.79 lakh MT against the total expected foodgrain production target of 160 lakh MT. In the light of less production of foodgrains during 2001-2002, the target for 2002-2003 has been fixed at 133 lakh MT â€” 65.90 lakh MT for kharif and 67.10 lakh MT for rabi.

Although rainfall in the entire state during kharif period was normal, it was not proportionate. While Patna, Magadh and Bhagalpur ranges remained affected by no rain, Darbhanga, Tirhut, Saharsa and Saran ranges had to suffer from flood water caused by excess rainfall in Nepal. Till August 15, about 57 per cent coverage by kharif crops was achieved. But transplantation in â€˜no rain landâ€™ began only when it had rain during the second week of August.

In the kharif season, about 37.14 lakh hectare areas could be covered against the target of 44 lakh hectares. There is a possibility of loss in production of kharif crop due to late transplantation, despite 85 per cent coverage. About 8 lakh hectares of crop areas in 24 districts remain affected by flood, the booklet said.

Inaugurating the conference, agriculture minister Ghulam Sarwar said that there is no respite from flood for Bihar till the Union government does not take a tough stand against the Nepal government to check discharge of water from its rivers to Bihar. He appealed to agriculture officers to be in touch with farmers to know their day-to-day problems and suggest remedies.

Agriculture production commissioner M M Singh underlined the need for increasing the coverage of maize, pulses and oil-seeds, particularly in hilly and diara areas adding production of boro-rice should be encouraged. He further stated that the foodgrain procurement centres of Food Corporation of India (FCI) would be increased this year from 40 to 100.

Agriculture director R K Khandelwal suggested that a team of five contact-farmers of each Panchayat should be selected and trained in scientific agricultural system with high-yielding crops. They should be equipped with technical knowledge, so that they can train other farmers. Inputs, including agricultural implements and seeds, should be distributed among farmers by organising workshop-cum-training camps.

4,Mumbai's spirit rules hearts of expats,"MUMBAI: Mumbai and Delhi are the among the worst cities in the world for expatriates to live in, says a study by the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the business information arm of the Economist group.

The EIU survey, which covered 130 cities, ranked Delhi and Mumbai 121 and 124 and attributed to them an ""extreme"" hardship rating of 62 and 57 per cent respectively. But do our expats really find Mumbai a hardship posting?

5,BJYM favours policy on youths,"PATNA: The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) is planning to reach the grass roots level to create awareness among the youth for the development of the country, said G Krishna Reddy, national president of the BJYM. Reddy, who was elected national president of the BJYM two months back, was here on his first visit to Bihar. He was addressing media persons at the BJPâ€™s state office here on Saturday.

Detailing the future plans of the party, Reddy said: â€œThe party is going to hold a meeting of all its office-bearers and state in-charges to discuss future plans and strategies in this regard.â€�

The party has also planned to hold separate meetings for all the regions. For this purpose, the entire country has been divided into five zones. The meeting of BJYM leaders from Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, which form one of the zones, would be held on November 12 at Jamshedpur. The meetings of other four zones would be held at Chennai, Hardwar, Indore and Ahmedabad.

Reddy laid stress on a comprehensive national policy for youth. â€œThe countryâ€™s youth form the largest part of the population. But there is no policy to guide them,â€� he said, adding that there should be policies for the youths to direct them to deal with different problems like terrorism, unemployment, drugs and other social evils.

He said that the BJYM has prepared a draft policy and offered many suggestions to the Central government to form a national policy for the youths and hoped that in the next session of Parliament it would be passed.

Meanwhile, the BJYMâ€™s state-level executive committee meet was also held on Saturday. Addressing the meeting, Reddy said, â€œThere is an urgent need to change the bad image of Bihar and for this the BJYM is going to launch a creative and integrated â€˜developmental revolutionâ€™ through which the youths would be made aware of the problems and their solutions.â€�

Reddy said that there was a great opportunity for development of agriculture-based industries in Bihar. â€œThe youths of Bihar are creative and talented and have the strength to make a new Bihar. The BJYM will extend all support in this regard,â€� he added.

BJP state president Nand Kishore Yadav also spoke on the occasion. Yadav said that it was useless to expect from the present government any development of the state. The Rabri government is destroying our old culture, tradition and peace of the state,â€� he added.

National general secretary of the BJYM Sunil Singh said that time has come for a complete revolution. The BJYM will make it successful both at the divisional and the block levels, he added.

8,2 commit suicide in city,"HYDERABAD: Two girl students committed suicide in separate incidents in the city on Saturday.

In the first incident, Rajitha, 22, a student of the Government Ayurveda College in S R Nagar committed suicide by hanging in her hostel room. Rajitha had apparently written an exam in the morning.

She finished her paper very early and went back to the hostel, Rajithaâ€™s friends told the police. Later her body was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her room. She was a native of Bhadrachalam.

The reason for Rajithaâ€™s suicide is yet to be established. However, police sources said they suspect that the girl committed suicide due to fear of failure in examinations.

In another incident, Swetha, 15, a ninth standard student of Central School hung herself to death at home on Saturday morning.

Swetha is said to have committed suicide after her parents allegedly chided her for not studying properly. She was a resident of Sanjeevaiah Colony in Bowenpally.

Police registered cases in both the incidents and are investigating.

9,State govt to coach budding jawans,"HYDERABAD: The government, keen on stepping up the stateâ€™s representation in the armed services, is putting the finishing touches to a programme to help young people join the forces.

The call to arms will be laced with a strong doze of patriotism. The government will hark back to the sacrifices made by our jawans and officers in Kargil.

The programme envisages Army recruitment training for about 25,000 youth. It aims to draw about 1,000 young men from each district, so that they find place in different levels of the military â€” from jawans to officers.

Preliminary discussions between the local Army recruitment officers and the government have already been held and the plan is slowly falling in place. The state has three recruitment zones and the Army invites applications periodically.

But most of the vacancies remain unfilled. The representation from the state at the lower levels of the armed forces is negligible. Officials attribute this to a lack of awareness among the youth about the armed forces. The awareness levels in the northern states is much higher.

The youth affairs department has earmarked Rs 1 crore to train the youth. The Army and police will be involved in the training programme. These young men will be coached in English and Hindi and given tips on how to take the written tests.

Emphasis will be on physical training. Army and police personnel will take the selected youth through an arduous fitness programme.

The trainees will be given free food and accommodation during the fortnight-long training, which will start in the second second week of November.

Though the armed forces are not prepared to disclose the number of vacancies they plan to fill from the state every year, government officials say the number could be in the thousands. The state officials would request the CM to make an appeal to the youth to join the armed services.

11,Indo-American Chambers favours consensus on disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: Indo-American Chamber of Commerce on Saturday favoured solving existing political differences relating to disinvestment process for smooth privatisation of PSUs.

""Such difference on policy decisions gives unfavourable signals to prospective investors,"" President Vinod Chandiok said releasing a study - Action areas for augmenting the flow of FDI into the country - here.

The general perception among the foreign investors is that no serious efforts are being made in India to address risks in right perspective, he added.

Only 220 out of Fortune 500 companies have presence in India, he said adding foreign investors perceive a set of risk elements while investing in India, including policy changes.

The study lists out a 10-point action to accelerate tempo of FDI inflow, particularly from the United States.

It suggested a upward revision of sectoral caps for FDI particularly in telecom and insurance sectors.

""Cap on FDI in the telecom sector should be increased to 74 per cent,"" the study said adding 26 per cent insurance cap also needed to be revised.

12,"BJP, BSP to revamp party units in J&K","JAMMU: In the wake of the rout the BJP and the BSP faced in the recent Assembly elections in J&K, the two parties plan to revamp their state units and appoint new chiefs soon. Between them, the two parties had a dozen members, with the BJP accounting for eight and the BSP for four in the last Assembly.

Both the parties have only one member each in the newly-constituted Assembly. The BJP had four legislators from Jammu district (Jammu east, Jammu west, Jammu cantt and Suchetgarh), one from Kathua (Hiranagar), two from Udhampur (Udhampur and Chenani) and one from Doda district in the last House.

Its sole representative in the new House now is Jugal Sharma who won from the Nagrota constituency of Jammu district by a narrow margin of just 67 votes.

On the other hand, the BSP had won two seats in Jammu (Raipur-Domana and Samba), one in Kathua and one in Doda district (Bhaderwah). The only BSP candidate who was victorious this time is Manjit Singh, who won from Vijaypur constituency in Jammu district.

State BJP and BSP chiefs, Daya Krishan Kotwal and Sheikh Abdul Rehman, respectively, had contested from Bhaderwah but lost to the Congress candidate. The poor performance of the two parties is now being blamed on the ineffective leadership.

The BJP''s poor performance has sent shock waves in the party and the factions led by Union Minister of State for Defence Chaman Lal Gupta and Kotwal have been blaming each other for the defeat of the party candidates. It is an open secret that the two leaders have sharp differences and their factions spent more time in sabotaging the chances of candidates of one another''s factions than attacking the rival parties.

Their differences spilled out into the open when party general secretary (in charge of J&K) O P Kohli and Manohar Lal held a meeting here to dissect the party''s performance some days ago. Charges were traded freely even as defeated candidates and senior party leaders watched in dismay.

Incidentally, another major factor for the defeat of the party''s candidates was the emergence of the RSS-backed Jammu State Morcha (JSM), which cut sharply into the party''s support base. Party candidates Ashok Khajuria (in Jammu east) and Pawan Kumar Gupta (in Udhampur) could have sailed through had the JSM and the BJP managed to close their ranks in the run-up to the elections.

In constituencies like Jammu West and Bhaderwah, the presence of rebel candidates like Hans Raj Dogra, allegedly backed by the Gupta faction, led to the defeat of JSM candidate Virender Gutpa and Kotwal because of the image of disunity they presented before the voters, admit senior party leaders.

The rout of the party can pose serious problems for Gupta, three-time MP from Udhampur constituency, who had won each time with improved margin. He has to face parliamentary elections two years from now but it is unlikely to be a cakewalk this time unless corrective steps are initiated now, party sources close to him say.

The BSP''s rout is being blamed on State Party Chief Sheikh Abdul Rehman''s alleged proximity to National Conference but his removal is unlikely to create too many problems because of the stranglehold Kanshi Ram has over the party. If it were not for the stout opposition from Rehman, the BSP could have reached an understanding on a limited number of seats with the BJP and this would have benefited both the parties, according to a senior BSP leader who requested anonymity.

She termed Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav''s claim that dissidents had got in touch with him to topple her government as a ""wild imagination"".

15,Cong-VHP workers clash during anti-Togadia rally,"NEW DELHI: Violent scenes were witnessed during a demonstration staged by activists of the All India Mahila Congress outside VHP Headquarters in New Delhi to protest Pravin Togadia''s ''objectionable'' remarks against Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

Allegations of stone-pelting were made by both the organisations as more than a dozen Congress and one VHP worker were claimed to be injured in the violence.

Claiming that the protesting Congress activists attacked the VHP office, its president Acharya Giriraj Kishore said: ""Congress is disturbing the peace and order prevailing in the society"" and threatened to ""reply in the same coin if need arises.""

Meanwhile, denying the allegations Delhi Mahila Congress President Ila Anand said: ""It is a premeditated attempt to disrepute the Congress party.""

Claiming that the demonstration was peaceful, she alleged that ""VHP workers pelted stones and tomatoes at the Congress workers from inside the office and mahila workers were injured in the attack.""

However, DCP (South-west) Tejinder Luthra said that a case had been registered against Mahila Congress activist ''as they had no permission to hold the rally.''

""Investigations are on to ascertain who started the violence and no arrest has been made so far,"" he said.

Both the organisations have lodged separate complaints with the police. Earlier Mahila Congress workers also burnt an effigy of Pravin Togadia.

17,New police chief to focus on city development,"BANGALORE: Improvements on the traffic scene, crime prevention and detection, modernisation, punishing the corrupt, providing effective administration: M.D. Singh is busy ticking off the areas he will focus on in the coming months. Singh assumes charge as the 21st Police Commissioner of Bangalore on Monday.

``I will continue the good work done by my predecessors, including H.T. Sangliana, whose public relations exercise will be continued. The force will be made more accessible to the people,'''' Singh told The Times of India on Sunday.

Singh, who was ADGP (Crime and Technical) with additional charge of Prisons, has not worked in the city proper in recent times, but is taking up the new job with zeal. ""I am aware of the Commissioner''s job and will make a sincere effort to make Bangalore a better place to live in.""

Singh believes in achieving targets through team work. ""I will talk to colleagues in all ranks and draw up a blueprint for Bangalore which is fast growing,"" Singh elaborated.

``I am aware of the fact that the Bangalore police staff strength is inadequate compared to the number of people living in the city. Despite this, we will work hard and ensure peace. I do not like to complain about trivial issues to the government or anybody. We will prove ourselves before asking for something,'''' he says.

The man who is now famous for tough action warns corrupt and inaccessible policemen to be careful. At the same time, he has words of encouragement for good officers. ``We will encourage those who do good work and send the Belliappas home.'''' In police circles, suspended ACP Belliappa has become synonymous with corruption.

Live band restaurants, gambling dens, illegal betting rackets, video piracy and outlets selling adulterated petrol and kerosene which have become a major source of revenue for the city''s budding and established criminals will come under my scanner, he adds. ""I will focus on detecting unsolved cases and preventing serious crimes. I will also reward crack sleuths for detecting unsolved cases.""

Improving the infrastructure of the city police by getting the much-awaited Global Positioning System (GPS) fitted in police vehicles is also on his must-do list.

Maintenance of law and order and continuing citizen-friendly programmes such as Makkala Sahaya Vani, Vanitha Sahaya Vani, Elders Helpline and Hello Neighbour are other important areas, he feels.

18,SGPC polls in mid-November,"CHANDIGARH: In order to thwart the mounting pressure from the Amarinder Singh government on SGPC members to dislodge the Badal group''s stranglehold on it, the SGPC executive plans to prepone the annual elections by about a fortnight and hold them in the second week of November. A formal announcement in this regard would be made in Kurukshetra, where the SGPC executive meets on Monday.

The venue of the meeting, which normally takes place in Amritsar, has been shifted to Kurukshetra in order to disarm Badal''s detractors from subverting it''s agenda and aborting it. According to the all-India Sikh Gurdwara Act, SGPC executive elections are to be conducted every year before November 30.

Even as the Badal group claims to be under intense pressure with chief minister Amarinder Singh allegedly using police coercion and allurements as a tool to wean them away from Badal, sources confirmed that the general house meeting would be held in the Teja Singh Samundari hall in the Golden temple in Amritsar.

Sources discounted speculation that the venue of the meeting might be shifted out of Punjab to defeat the designs of the Amarinder government. An intense battle of wits has been going on between the Badal group and its opponents for gaining control of the SGPC.

More than 90 SGPC members associated with Badal are said be hiding in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to escape the â€˜trap'' laid by the anti-Badal camp comprising former SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra, senior Panthic Morcha leader Ravi Inder singh and chief minister Amarinder Singh.

They are expected to come overground only on the day the SGPC elections take place.

Badal enjoys support of about 115 SGPC members while the Tohra faction has some 53 members with it.

While Badal rebutted reports suggesting that some SGPC members from his group have joined the socalled third front led by Mal Singh Ghumman, he said while some of the names had been listed without the consent of the concerned SGPC members, some others appeared to be part of the move under police pressure. He suggested there was no credibility in reports saying Ghumman was leading the third front.

Expressing serious concern at the manner in which police had been hounding SGPC members, Badal said never in his life had he seen elections being held under such police terror and threat. He said custodial surveillance imposed on the SGPC members in the form of unsolicited security cover was in fact a brazen attempt by the chief minister to browbeat them. It was shocking to see how family members of the SGPC members were also being victimised, Badal added.

19,"Lots of panels, govt schools no better","NEW DELHI: If there is one thing Delhi state government does not lack, it is advice on how to improve the quality of education in its schools. At least four committees and other groups have already suggested what can be done to change things. But the high rate of dropouts and lack of infrastructure indicates how few recommendations have been implemented.

On Thursday, another such committee formed by Delhi government submitted its report with Delhi state chief minister Sheila Dikshit. The panel recommended sweeping policy changes, including the formation of an autonomous body called Sarvodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan.

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what the previous three bodies had recommended:

Delhi School Education Advisory Board: The 15-member board was formed earlier this year to give suggestions on matters of policy. The board is chaired by state education minister R K Chauhan. The board has not suggested any major policy changes yet.

The lieutenant-governor (L-G) committee: The panel, headed by the L-G was constituted last year. Members included then education minister Narender Nath, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) chairman Ashok Ganguly, Delhi University professor of education Anil Sadgopal, representatives of UNICEF, NCERT and principals of some private and government schools.

The panel suggested limiting ""summer vacation"" in schools to six weeks, forming school-level managing committees, involving school teachers in writing of textbooks and utilising the pool of retired teachers till regular appointments were made.

Chandla Committee: In 1995, the government constituted the Chandla committee to review the Delhi Education Act, 1972. The recommendations were not made public, nor was the Act revised. Sadgopal, as head of DUâ€™s education department, had approached Dikshit with suggestions to improve the government system.

""We had suggested devolution of powers to school principals, setting up boards for clusters of schools,"" Sadgopal added. The suggestions were not accepted.

Scores of committees down the line, even government officials have become cynical.

Earlier this year, the government did initiate some action on the schoolsâ€™ front under the Bhagidari scheme. Nearly 55 committees were formed and the government promised more.

The latest committee, headed by S C Vats, was formed last year when the issue of handing over poorly performing schools to private societies came up. The committee was asked to give suggestions on how to improve these schools. Many officials are unhappy with its report.

On Thursday, when the report was presented, Chauhan reportedly said the committee had not touched upon the primary subject of improving poorly performing schools.

20,SGPC officials allot shop by violating rules,"AMRITSAR: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) officials have allegedly allotted one shop of Guru Arjun Dev Niwas located in the SGPC complex by violating rules.

The shop, that could have fetched around Rs 1 lakh as donation and a monthly rent of around Rs 5,000, was allotted at a rent of Rs 1,500 per month only without any advance, sources said.

One Amarjit Kaur had applied for the allotment of a shop for opening a STD/ PCO booth in Guru Arjun Dev Niwas, to the president of the committee but the application allegedly never reached him and the secretary of the committee Harbeant Singh on August 28, on his own, sought a report from Ajaib Singh, manager Golden Temple regarding allotting the shop, sources said.

The manager in his report submitted on September 20 recommended a monthly rent of Rs 1,000, which was, however later increased to Rs 1,500 by Harbeant Singh.

While the application should have been forwarded to the president of the property sub committee that recommends its decision to executive body for its final approval. The executive body generally favours open auction of any shop to be allotted.

Sources said that none of the above procedures was followed. Interestingly the item for allotment of shop was not included in the printed agenda given to executive members before their meeting on September 24 even when there was sufficient time to do so.

A resolution to this effect was reportedly passed without discussion in the meeting and the same was dispatched to the manager for further action on October 2.

Sukhdev Singh Bharu, executive member of SGPC told Times News Network that no such item was discussed in the executive committee meeting.

Blaming the concerned SGPC officials for their alleged favouritism and deceitful practices, he said he would take up the issue of keeping the SGPC executive members in the dark and in violation of SGPC rules in the meeting being held on Monday.

He said that earlier a STD/PCO booth was allotted on a donation of Rs 50,000 and a monthly rent of Rs 4,200 couple of years ago.

21,Inquiry against principal for faking date of birth,"CHANDIGARH: Panjab University has ordered an in-depth inquiry into a unique complaint alleging faking of date of birth certificate by the principal of one of its affiliated colleges who allegedly also used it to his advantage to become an officer in National Cadet Corps (NCC).

A preliminary enquiry has found reasons to order an in-depth inquiry.

The complaint, along with an affidavit and documents supporting allegations, sent by Joginder Singh, a lecturer in political science, to the PU vice-chancellor and also some of its syndicate members alleged that Surjit Singh Randhawa, principal of SGGS Khalsa College, Mahilpur, was born on April 2, 1954 but later adopted May 27, 1965 as his date of birth.

Complaints against the principal had also been received from RP Singh, Col SS Bains, VK Meham and DS Kang who knew Randhawa in some capacity or the other.

Outlining the novel manner in which Randhawa allegedly went about changing his date of birth, Joginder Singh said he had discovered another Surjit Singh whose fatherâ€™s name was similar to that of his own father, Teja Singh.

However, the latter Surjit Singh was 11 years younger and the complainant alleged that the senior Surjit found it tempting to discard his earlier and true date of birth certificate in favour of a false certificate.

PU registrar Paramjit Singh said â€˜â€˜Surjit Singh may be in possession of a matric certificate of another Surjit Singh with a different date of birth and has tried to take advantage of as many as 11 years. This is evident from different documents produced by him at different times bearing sometimes one date of birth and at other times the second date of birth.â€™â€™

The registrar has recommended that a regular enquiry be held giving Randhawa full opportunity to explain his position.

22,SOG protest efforts for disbanding,"JAMMU: Officers working in the special operations group and the special task force are angry with the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party for advocating the disbanding of these counter-insurgency units.

â€˜â€˜What hurts most is that we (SOG/STF staff) bore the brunt of militantsâ€™ wrath, made sacrifices and are still being vilified. Lack of a clear transfer policy means senior officers forget you once you are posted to STF/SOG,â€™â€™ a senior police officer said.

Most staff, however, admitted that disbanding would give them some respite as they had served in dangerous situations for too long.

23,Coronary bypass: ‘Watchband incision’ leaves its first mark,"MUMBAI: Surgeons at the cityâ€™s new heart hospital in Mulund performed Indiaâ€™s first coronary bypass with a graft of the radial artery taken from the patientâ€™s forearm with a newly introduced endoscope and ultrasonic scalpel. Dr Kaushal Pandey and his colleagues at the Wockhardt Heart Hospital, assisted by Dr Mark Genovesi, the American heart surgeon credited with the innovation called â€˜watchband, incisionâ€™, and his team of doctors, performed the operation on a 67-year-old man, which was beamed live by a satellite uplink to several centres in the city.

In the traditional method of harvesting the radial artery, an 18-to-25 cm-long cut is made along the forearm, extending from the wrist to the elbow. This leaves a long scar, which is more difficult to hide than the scar on the chest and therefore has a greater psychosocial impact on the patientâ€™s life. In contrast, the new method requires just one keyhole incision to access the artery in the forearm. â€œWe did our first procedure three years ago, mainly to advance minimally invasive heart surgery,â€™â€™ Dr Genovesi told TNN after the operation.

â€œSubsequently, it turned out that the smaller incision had tremendous patient satisfaction. The patients were able to hide the incision, so their family, friends and employers did not have to know that they had a heart-related problem. â€œThe technique has progressed to the point where I personally believe that the radial artery harvested endoscopically is a better conduit,â€™â€™ Dr Genovesi added. â€œIt has less spasm, less trauma, and is probably a better conduit than when itâ€™s taken through a long open incision. Finally, itâ€™s turned out to be a huge advantage for the surgeons as well because the technique is simpler and less demanding.â€™â€™ Dr Pandey told TNN that it was exciting to use the ultrasonic harmonic scalpel for the first time outside the US, within three months of its introduction. During bypass surgery, a blood vessel is taken from elsewhere in the patientâ€™s body to create a bypass around the coronary block.

In the early years, grafts from the saphenous veins from the patientâ€™s legs were used. However, these grafts tend to get blocked within ten to 12 years. Veins are still used today. But the preferred conduit for restoring the heartâ€™s blood supply today is the internal mammary artery. This has a greater resistance to blockage and consequently is said to remain open for 20 years or longer. However, a major limitation of this â€˜gold standardâ€™ is that it can be used to correct only one or two blocked vessels. In cases involving multiple blocks, therefore, grafts from saphenous veins or the radial artery have to be considered. â€œThe radial artery was used as a bypass graft in the early years of coronary surgery by the French surgeon Alain Carpentier; but its use was abandoned for a number of years because of the occurrence of graft occlusions,â€™â€™ explained G.B. Parulkar, cardiovascular surgeon and director of the Wockhardt Heart Hospital. However, in 1989, during an angiographic examination, doctors accidentally found that grafts made from the radial artery, made 18 years earlier and thought to be blocked, were actually open and functioning. This has led to a resurgence of interest in this artery as a source of coronary grafts.

Radial artery grafting had, therefore, become standard procedure in correction of multiple-coronary blocks today. Until now, surgeons have had to harvest the radial artery through a long incision from the elbow to the wrist. â€œWomen, particularly, donâ€™t like it,â€™â€™ Dr Parulkar said. â€œThe long incision also enhances the danger of clot formation, infection and thickening of the scar. The watchband incision obviates all that. With this technique radial artery grafting is expected to become more common.â€™â€™
