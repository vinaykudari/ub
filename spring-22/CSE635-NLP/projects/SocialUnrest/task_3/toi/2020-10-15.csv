0,"Finally, dengue stings govt","NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday finally woke up to the nationwide spread of dengue. Alarmed by the occurrence of the disease this time round, first in Kerala, then in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the inclusion of the disease under an integrated national programme for prevention of mosquito-borne diseases.

At present, there are six different national programmes on disease control covering malaria, kala-azar and filaria. None of the national programmes so far covered dengue and Japanese encephyalitis.

The CCEA has decided to merge all the six disease control programmes into a single programme called National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme and to include these two diseases under the programme as well.

1,VHP rally disrupts traffic,"NEW DELHI: The cityâ€™s commuters had a harrowing time on Wednesday due to the Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s (VHP) rally that started from Ramlila Maidan at noon and proceeded through major roads in Central and North Delhi.

The areas which suffered severe traffic snarls included Vikas Marg, Laxmi Nagar, Mother Dairy, Ring Road, Dilli Gate and ITO. Though the traffic policeâ€™s helpline, reportedly, did not receive any calls after 2:50 pm, the situation normalised only about 4:30 pm. â€˜â€˜Traffic was literally immobile at Laxmi Nagar T-point and on Vikas Marg.

Autorickshaws were simply refusing to take you anywhere and if they agreed their charges were sky high,â€™â€™ said Pragati Singh who spent nearly an hour just covering the length of Vikas Marg. According to traffic officials, the 8,000 strong rally was meant to be restricted to the ground itself. However, it took to the streets and from Ramlila Maidan went to Subhash Marg, Ring Road and the Raj Ghat. â€˜â€˜The turnout at the rally was less then we had expected.

The traffic slowed down about 1 pm, once the rally took to the road. But traffic was normalised by 2:30 pm,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (traffic - northern range) Pradeep Hota.

3,Prepare report on plaint of NCP member: PSHRC to principal secy,"LUDHIANA: The Punjab State Human Rights Commission (PSHRC) has asked the principal secretary, home department, Punjab, inspector general of police (litigation), and the Ludhiana SSP, to prepare a report and submit it before January 30, 2004, on the complaint of Dr Balwant Singh, a member of the economic cell of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

In the complaint, he had alleged that an FIR had been registered against him on a false complaint lodged by Gopal Dass, comptroller, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. The FIR was registered against Dr Balwant Singh at the Sarabha Nagar police station on June 9 this year on the directions of the then Ludhiana SSP H S Sidhu.

Gopal Dass had alleged that Dr Balwant Singh had used derogatory racist expletives against him in front of the main administrative block of PAU during lunch time on June 2. Dass had named four eyewitnessesâ€”Gurbachan Singh, Piara Singh, J S Dhiman, and Diwan Chandâ€” to support his allegation.

Subsequently, Dr Singh was arrested on July 12 and sent in judicial custody till July 25; later, he was released on bail.

In his complaint to the PSHRC, Dr Singh had alleged that on the verbal orders of PAU vice-chancellor Dr K S Aulakh, on June 2, he was not allowed to enter the university campus, where he had gone to collect his pension from the bank and get a check-up of his ailing wife done by the university hospital doctors.

Having no option left, he said, he returned home and later attended a meeting of the entrepreneur cell of the NCP from 12:30 pm to 2:30 pm.

Dr Singh alleged that since he was not allowed to enter the university, there was no question of his meeting Gopal Dass and hurling abuses on him.

He alleged that Dass had concocted a story to frame him at Dr Aulakh''s behest, as he had complained to the Punjab chief minister that Dass had been appointed comptroller in violation of the statutes of the university.

He had also alleged that the four ""tutored"" witnesses, all employees of PAU, had joined Dass in exchange of undue favours.

Dr Singh had also submitted to the commission that the police had arrested him without conducting even a preliminary inquiry. He added that neither he, nor other functionaries of the NCP with whom he had attended the meeting on the said date had been questioned by the police. He had alleged that he had been subjected to torture and humiliation.

In his order, justice R L Anand, member of the PSHRC, had observed that Dr Singh''s case comes under human rights violation.

4,Robber takes lawyer's daughter hostage,"JALANDHAR: The house of a Jalandhar lawyer has been surrounded by the police force as tension is building up in the Adarsh Nagar locality after a ""robber"" armed with a pistol took the little five-yearold daughter of the lawyer and held her as a hostage.

The robber, who was earlier demanding Rs 20,000 at the gun-point, is now demanding a safe passage, police disclosed.

When the robber entered, Ashok Sonic was out at the courts and his daughter Ashna and son Arjun, along with wife Seema, were inside. There was a scuffle and the wife managed to escape along with her 10-year-old son. The robber caught hold of the daughter and took her hostage, according to the husband.

At the time of filing this report, the police were following a ""wait and watch"" strategy.

""There is no need to panic. The man had demanded soft drinks. We sent them in. He is conversing with us in Hindi as well as in Punjabi, trying to hide his identity. We have even offered him safe passage, but he seems to be hesitating,"" the SSP HS Sidhu said.

The wife was hit by the butt of the gun the robber was carrying in the scuffle when she escaped. He is being described as short of stature. The hostage drama started around 4 pm.

The surrounding terraces were jampacked with ""shocked and astonished'' people. Police were facing a tough time handling thousands of curious onlookers who refused to go.

5,Rising onion prices put DF govt on back foot,"MUMBAI: Politics and onions sure don''t mix. As onion prices continued to shoot up in the state due to a supply shortage, the Congress-led Democratic Front (DF) was moving fast to counter criticism from the opposition.

Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Wednesday instructed state marketing minister Harshwardhan Patil to convene a meeting with the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), the Agriculture Market Produce Committee (APMC) and Mantralaya officials to discuss ways to help consumers.

Onion prices have more than doubled in the last 10 days from Rs 8 to Rs 18 per kg. Prices are likely to remain high till Diwali, said wholesale traders and dealers on Wednesday. It may be recalled that spiralling onion prices in 1998 were held partly responsible for the fall of the BJP-led government in Delhi in 1999.

The recent price rise is being attributed to the irregular monsoon and drought-like conditions in Nashik and Ahmednagar, the two major onion cultivation districts in Maharashtra.

Shiv Sena MLC Kanhaiyalal Gidwani, however, claimed that prices have been â€œartificially raisedâ€™â€™ by traders who are in cahoots with APMC and NAFED officials. â€œA lobby of traders is controlling the whole process from storage to sale in local markets and exports as well.

The government should immediately do a survey of all godowns to check whether these traders are hoarding stocks to jack up prices,â€™â€™ he said.

In the wholesale APMC market in Vashi, traders were paying Rs 105 for 10 kg on Tuesday as compared to the normal Rs 50. â€œFresh produce from Nashik district will come in around November 15,â€™â€™ said Raju Shirke, secretary of the Kanda Batata Adat Vyapari Sangh. He added, â€œEven exports have stopped because of low supply and high prices.â€™â€™ However, he said, prices were not likely to increase any more.

7,VHP rally disrupts Delhi traffic,"NEW DELHI: Thumbing its nose at the Allahabad High Court, which had said that the ASI report should not be used by religious or political groups to further their own agenda, the VHP began its Ayodhya rally here on Wednesday by emphasising the excavation report.

â€˜â€˜Khudai ke sabut ke baad bhi; mandir ke virodh kyon?â€™â€™ read VHP banners as the procession was flagged off by VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia and other VHP leaders. The crowd was smaller than expected but traffic was thrown out of gear.

8,UP govt has VHP reeling,"AYODHYA: Massive crackdown on VHP activists and raids at the twin-power centres of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad in Ayodhya â€” Karsevakpuram and Ramsevakpuram â€”has practically broken the backbone of the VHP which is now looking for alibis in case it fails in its bid for the much-touted October 17 programme.

What has further caused panic among the VHP rank-and-file is the state administration''s announcement to send the VHP working president Ashok Singhal behind bars if he was sighted in Ayodhya and posed any threat to the law and order situation.

""We would not hesitate in arresting Singhal if he poses any security risk. Presence of the VHP leader in Ayodhya was only a rumour but our intelligence units are at the job to locate him. We hope to arrest him before he enters Ayodhya,"" warned IG zone VN Rai.

Soon after the announcement of the IG Zone, who personally supervised the raids at Karsevakpuram and Ramsevakpuram, other senior VHP leaders went underground. About 600 VHP activists, including senior VHP leader Rajendra Pankaj, were arrested during the raids.

Emboldened by the success, another raid was conducted at Hindu Dhaam, the residence of former MP and VHP leader Dr Ram Vilas Vedanti, who, however, managed to give a slip. Dr Vednati was sent to Ayodhya on Tuesday by Mahant Avaidyanath, convener of the Ram Mandir Uchchadhikar Samiti, to co-ordinate and look after arrangements for October 17 ""Dev darshan and Sankalp sabha"" programmes.

Later in the evening, another raid was conducted at Dr Vedanti''s residence where he insisted on being arrested but was placed under house arrest instead. A heavy posse of policemen has now been deployed outside his house. On October 17, the VHP has proposed to hold an assembly of what its calls ""Ram bhakts"" and after ""darshan"" of Ashta Chakra (eight) temples, including Ram Lala, they would take a pledge on the bank of the Saryu for the construction of Ram temple.

However, after the massive crackdown, both Ramsevakpuram and Karsevakpuram wore a deserted look. Chanting of Ramdhun is continuing but saffron-clad activists are nowhere to be seen. ""After they arrested all Ram bhakts residing in Ramsevakpuram and Karsevakpuram and stopping those coming from other places, it may be difficult for us to hold the programmes as we had planned. But we are unfazed by the developments and would hold the programmes as scheduled,"" reacted Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Ram Janambhoomi Nyas.

Commenting on the situation, he termed the administration''s actions as ""unfortunate"". He conceded that under present circumstances, number of activists congregating in Ayodhya on October 17 had lost its importance. In the absence of charismatic mahant late Ramchandra Parmhans Das, the VHP, sadhus and saints of Ayodhya seem leaderless. They now pin their hopes on Ashok Singhal and Praveen Togadia to reach here and take command of activists left to save the prestige of VHP on October 17.

Earlier, district magistrate Deepak Kumar told Times News Network over telephone that neither the buildings situated inside Karsewakpuram, nor its go-downs or community kitchens had been sealed.

""We will not allow any congregation in any part of Ayodhya. Those who are on a month-long ""Kartik kalpwas"" would remain here, but those coming with the intention to participate in the VHP programme would not be allowed entry in the city,"" he added.

The administration is also reported to have shortlisted different akharas, maths and temples here as places of possible hideouts of VHP leaders and activists. A vigorous search operation to flush out such persons after identifying them is likely to continue throughout Wednesday night.

Administrative sources also confirmed that it has decided to put a ban on all VHP leaders, temple movement seers and pro-temple politicians to avoid any build-up in the city. Check-points have been set up on all roads, lanes and bylanes leading to the city. Heavy patrolling is being conducted at places which are connected with nearby villages.

9,Paswan: LJP to go it alone in LS polls,"GOPALGANJ: Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday ruled out the possibility of seat adjustment with Congress in the coming Lok Sabha polls and said his party would contest all seats in Bihar and elsewhere on it own.

â€œThere is no question of having electoral alliance with the Congress ... We will think of supporting the Congress if it is in a position of forming the government at the Centre after the elections next year,â€� he said.

The LJP would also contest the forthcoming assembly polls in all the five states, he said. â€œMayawati claims to be the messiah of Dalits on the basis of money power. But after the CBI raid on her residence, the leaders are deserting her and the BSP,â€� Paswan said. PTI

Paswan supported the decision to provide reservation to economically weak forward castes and said with Congress and other parties welcoming it, the Centre should immediately bring a legislation to amend the constitution to provide reservation to forwards.

10,Expert blames govt for lack of industry,"PATNA: The tea industry in Kishanganj district is gasping for breath because of the prevailing â€œinspector rajâ€�, negative approach of banks and imposition of excessive sales tax on tea producers in Bihar compared to that in West Bengal, chairman of Apex Tea Exports R Daftari said this here at a seminar on â€œAgro and Food Processingâ€� organised by Confederation of India Industries (CII), Bihar.

Daftari said that there is immense potential for growth of tea industry in five blocks of Kishanganj district. â€œThe barren lands, if utilised for tea plantation, will provide gainful employment, entrepreneurial and marketing opportunities to at least five per cent population of Kishanganj district,â€� he said.

He, however, added that the entrepreneurs, who were earlier planning to start tea blending and packaging units in Kishanganj, have now decided to shift their units to West Bengal. It is due to the â€œinspector rajâ€� in the state.

Daftari said that a second tea processing unit could not be opened in Bihar as the state government failed to give subsidies, which is given by the West Bengal government, to the tea processors.

The participants at the seminar said that the state has immense potential for agro-based products and if they can be exploited with adequate infrastructural support by government and development of entrepreneurial skills among the local people. The technical sessions were presided over by the convenor, Agro Food Processing Panel of CII, Bihar, K P S Keshri. State industries minister V M Sharma inaugurated the meet.

The project director of Agriculture Technology Management Agency, K M Singh, said that 30 important herbs were growing around Patna in Patna in the form of weeds and they had to be grown and capitalised for domestic and international market. â€œOur herbal wealth has great commercial production potential,â€� he said.

A Nabard manager, D Ghosh, informed the participants about the capital investment subsidy scheme which is to be implemented through Nabard, NCDC and National Horticulture Board.

Stressing on the need for opening rural godowns, she said that in Bihar 213 cold storages have the capacity to store only 7.3 lakh tonnes of fruits while the fruit production in the state is 152 lakh tonnes per annum.

A representative of Baidyanayth Ayurved Ltd, Kanchan Prabha, said that stress should be laid on preservation of medicinal plants and organic farming.

12,Seven Naxalites arrested in Devarakonda,"NALGONDA/WARANGAL: Seven People''s War (PW) militants and a person providing shelter to them were arrested by the Devarakonda sub-division police on Tuesday. A claymore mine and a battery were recovered from them.

Devarakonda DSP Ramakrishna said that the Krishnapatti dalam, which operates along the Krishna river belt, had reportedly been taking shelter in the house of Devarakonda village head Singam Kanakaiah during their visits and the entire family had been helping the dalam over the last three years.

The police had received information that eight members of the Grama Rakshana Committee (village protection committee) set up by PW would join the dalam to take military training during October second week.

The police arrested Singam Anjaiah (21), the son of Kanakaiah, Grama Rakshana Committee leader Kethavath Raghu and recovered a claymore mine from his house. The arrested militants include P Bhagat Singh (24) who earlier worked in the Panibhagchi dalam in Warangal for four years. Singh is a private medical practitioner and extended medical treatment to injured dalam members on several occasions, the police said.

Others who were arrested include tribals Kethavath Kalya (24), Kethavath Mangya (20), Hema (20), Hari (25) and Singam Muthaiah. They reportedly told the police that they joined the movement after Singam Yellamma, the daughter of the village head joined the PW dalam three months ago and underwent military training.

Meanwhile, PW naxalites shot dead a former MPTC member of Ramannagudem village in Eturnagaram mandal of Warangal district on Wednesday evening branding him an informer.

15,Ready for early elections: CPI,"HYDERABAD: The state unit of CPI on Wednesday asserted that it was ready to face early elections.

The party, which had earlier organised padayatras covering 75 municipalities in the state on development of backward regions and other issues, demanded that the government announce a special package for the Telangana region.

Addressing a public meeting, CPI national secretary A B Bardhan urged the government to initiate unconditional talks with the People''s War. When the Centre can hold talks with militants in Jammu and Kashmir and Naga militants, why can''t the state government hold talks with the PW, he asked.

Underdevelopment, regional imbalances, socio-economic conditions are the reasons for naxalism to emerge, he said adding that the government should lay emphasis on land distribution and problems facing the farm sector.

Referring to the Ayodhya issue, he demanded chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu make his stand clear in the wake of the VHP, RSS and BJP supporting the Ram Lalla darshan at Ayodhya.

CPI state secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said that the TDP would have to lose power one year in advance if it depended on sympathy wave. The party would intensify the stir if the government fails to announce a special package within a month, he said.

16,Steep increase in white-collar crimes,"HYDERABAD: Economic offenders have cheated the public of over Rs 1,400 crore since 2000. While urban cooperative banks accounted for a major share of this figure, the last three years also saw a rise in the number of scamsters floating bogus firms to cheat people out of their money.

As per figures compiled by the economic offences wing of the Crime Investigation Department (CID), people lost about Rs 446 crore last year, up from Rs 185 crore and Rs 91 crore in the previous two years respectively. Rough estimates revealed that over Rs 700 crore had been pocketed by economic offenders this year.

The CID study compiled figures relating to various economic offences ranging from cheating by financial institutions, stock market scams, counterfeit currency, passport, land and job rackets, misappropriation of funds of government and private institutions, piracy, and cyber crimes.

Sources said the number of cases involving job rackets has registered a steady increase over the last three years. Police booked 156 cases last year, against the 107 cases filed in the previous year. Incidentally, cases relating to narcotic drugs came down from 596 in 2000 to 432 last year.

Sources said the statistics were calculated on the basis of first information reports. Interestingly, Rangareddy district, Vijayawada and Guntur recorded more economic offences compared to Hyderabad, though the aggregate amount involved was much less. While Rangareddy registered 485 cases in 2002, Guntur registered 264 and Vijayawada 532. Hyderabad had 186 cases registered involving Rs 32 crore.

Vizianagaram, Kadapa, Mahabubnagar and Srikakulam districts had fewer than 100 economic offences.

17,Space curbs hamper development,"HYDERABAD: The lack of open space in the Old City is the reason why parks and amenities are not being developed in the area, certain officials say. Others, however, blame apathy by government agencies.

Several areas in the city suffer because government agencies lack focus on development. The Old City is a major case in point, a Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad official said. ""It is high time that the government views the development of the Old City seriously rather than just making empty promises,"" he added.

Several localities in the Old City do not have proper roads, street lightning, no drainage facilities or even drinking water connections, he added.

Another MCH official said there is no space for developing parks or any other facilities in the Old City compared to recently developed colonies. Most of the land is not marked out properly, he said.

Without a 40:60 ratio of open space to building space, it is very difficult to maintain proper living conditions, he said. The open space available in most of the localities of the Old City is hardly 5 to 10 per cent of the area, the official added.

""We want to take up several developmental activities like developing greenery on the lines of parks being developed around Hussainsagar. If the elected representatives help us to identify land, we will immediately take up the development of the parks,"" he said.

The official said the corporation has laid the maximum number of cement roads this year in the Old City. But the density of houses is so high that no amount of spending by the MCH or any other government agency will be visible to the people, he added.

However, he said, ""we are taking up road widening in several places in the Old City. The Charminar Pedestrianisation Project is also a boon to the Old City."" Another problem the MCH officials face is the nonpayment of tax by many residents of the Old City.

""We are spending much more than what we collect in the form of property taxes from the Old City,"" he said.

19,Release arrested leaders: Naidu urges Mulayam,"NEW DELHI: With more Sangh Parivar leaders being arrested in Uttar Pradesh, the Bharaitya Janata Party jumped to the defence of the VHP, seeking the UP government to release the activists who have been arrested.

BJP chief Venkaiah Naidu suggested that the VHP programme be allowed to go on in a regulated manner after the release of those arrested.

""I appeal to the state government to release all sants, leaders and Ram bhakts so that there can be a proper climate to let the VHP programme in Ayodhya go on peacefully,"" he said.

Naidu also asked the VHP to cooperate with the state government and sought to dispel notions of a rift between the two Sangh outfits.

""It is not necessary for BJP to agree on each and every programme of the VHP. I believe some statements of VHP were not good for the temple movement and it is not going to help them,"" he said.

Parent organisation, the RSS has been active in trying to ensure that the BJP and VHP do not appear to be speaking in different voices.

RSS chief K S Sudershan has shown unprecedented initiative in getting the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to see things from the VHP''s point of view.

The RSS, which usually steers clear at least in public of bickering between the two, has been actively seeking the Centre''s intervention to ensure the VHP programme is not hampered.

Naidu, urging the VHP to coordinate with the UP government, welcomed Sudershan''s message to Ram bhakhts to ensure a peaceful Sankalp Sammelan.

24,"VHP march a political stunt, says Bardhan","HYDERABAD: The proposed Ayodhya march by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) was a electoral stunt aimed at deriving political mileage in view of the forthcoming assembly polls, CPI general secretary A B Bardhan said.

""There is nothing religious about it and it lacks people''s support,"" he observed.

The VHP, RSS and the BJP were hand-in-glove on the issue as was borne out by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s ""advice"" to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav to avoid confrontation with the VHP workers, Bardhan told reporters on Thursday.

""Advani is acting more like an agent of the VHP than a home minister,"" he observed.

The VHP''s remarks that riots would take place, if they were prevented, shows that they wanted to divide the people on communal lines and gain from it, Bardhan said.

He complimented the Mulayam Singh government for its tough action against the build-up and said that the VHP''s assurances of peaceful march could not be believed in view of the experiences of December 6, 1992, when Babri masjid was demolished.

Discussing the party''s strategies for the forthcoming polls, Bardhan said the CPI was not going to have any alliance with the Congress.However, the party would support other Left allies and like-minded parties such as Janata Dal (Secular) and Samanatha Dal in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, wherever it is not strong enough to field its candidate.

However, he did not ruled out the possibility of alliance with the Congress in AP.

The CPI leader criticised the Centre for its ''frenzy drive'' to sell-off public sector undertakings and charged it with trying to bypass the Supreme Court ruling in the process.

Bardhan also took a dig at the judiciary for its recent judgments on issues related to ban on hartals and right to strike. ""Such policies are dangerous for the existence of democracy and this drives people to extremism,"" he said.

25,Congress is a party sans any clarity: BJP,"HYDERABAD: The state unit of BJP alleged that the Congress had fear of elections as it was not sure of its political fortunes in the coming elections.

The Congress lacked clarity on important issues as its leaders had divergent views on issues like Telangana, irrigation projects, BJP state unit president N Indrasena Reddy told the reporters on Thursday.

Further there was no unity among its leaders and hence it had postponed its proposed bus journey, he said.

Commenting on CPI national secretary A B Bardhan''s suggestion that the government should hold talks with naxalites, he said that BJP had always favoured talks to resolve the issue. Even the all party meeting had earlier suggested the same, he said.

Reddy said the party was defeated in Karwan bypoll due to the partisan attitude of former city police commissioner. He blamed that the police had ignored alleged irregularities during the by-election.

26,Technical gaffe embarrasses I&B minister,"PATNA: The union information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday suffered a major embarrassment when a Doordarshan technical staff removed the mike when the BJP national general secretary Pramod Mahajan was addressing the party workers at the state council meeting of the party.

""I had not asked for the mike. You had yourself put it here "", Mahajan told the technician. Later on, in a lighter vein, Mahajan also told the I&B minister, "" Raviji do they remove the mike after you finish your speech at a meeting."" A visibly embarrassed Prasad remained nonplussed and preferred to keep quiet. A nervous technician immediately came down leaving the mike at the dais.

Meanwhile, the former BJP president Nand Kishore Yadav on Thursday took strong exception to the filing of FIRs against the president of Patna Mahanagar unit of the party by Patna district administration for displaying party posters and promotional matters in the town allegedly violating the model code of conduct of the election commission.

He said that the Patna district administration had failed to take similar action against anyone RJD leader although the ruling party had also put party posters in the town during its national convention held in Patna on October 10 and 11.

27,Sharief gets flak from ministers,"BANGALORE: Taking on Congress MP C K Jaffer Sharief, two ministers said on Thursday that the party would face the next elections under the leadership of Chief Minister S M Krishna.

Sharief, at a recent function organised by the State Minorities Development Corporation, had taken exception to Public Works Minister Dharam Singhâ€™s statement on Krishna leading the party in the next polls and maintained that it was the Congress high command which decides who should lead the party.

Housing Minister C R Sageer Ahmed and Minorities and Wakfs Minister M L Ustad, who were both present when Sharief made his statement, told reporters here: ""What Sharief said is his personal opinion. We feel what Singh said was correct. It is the opinion of the party and the public that Krishna should lead the party in the next poll.""

Ahmed said Sharief was a senior minorities leader. ""But the issue of the leadership is made on the basis of the partyâ€™s welfare and not community,"" he maintained.

The Congress tradition is to go to polls under the leadership of the existing CM. ""We have gone to polls under M Veerappa Moily, now Madhya Pradesh is going under Digvijay Singh. The high command takes the final decision, but this has been the trend of their decision-making. After four years of exemplary rule, Krishna should lead,"" Ahmed stated.

Ustad contended that Krishna had done a lot for minorities welfare, be it the release of Rs 5.50 crore for shadi mahals or the allocation of Rs 16 crore for minorities welfare schemes, ""which is more than what anyone else has done.""

28,Golawala is city police's 'most wanted' man,"VADODARA: The city police have launched a massive manhunt to nab notorious criminal Salim Golawala who has now been labelled as Vadodaraâ€™s â€˜most wantedâ€™ man. According to the police, Golawala has been named as an accused in about a dozen cases and is wanted in six of them.

The police are also probing his underworld connections with the erstwhile Latif gang of Ahmedabad, particularly his relations with Abdul Wahab. Sources in the city police said that Golawala was nabbed in Mumbai about 10 years ago along with Wahab and one Salim Tola. Tola was then touted to be a close associate of Wahab. He is believed to be involved in several offences with Wahab.

Since Golawala did not have any criminal background at that time, he was allowed to go after questioning. However, in subsequent interrogations, Tola revealed that Golawala was close to Wahab. Recently, a mob had attacked police officials who had gone to Moti Vhorwad area to nab Golawala and managed to free him after seriously injuring a policeman. The incident had even led to rioting in the area.

The detection of crime branch police station at Wadi was also attacked by the mob. Now, nabbing Golawala has become a prestige issue for the city police, particularly after this incident. Commissioner of police Sudhir Sinha said Golawala was acquitted in one offence registered against him, but was still wanted in six others. â€œWe have issued orders that he should be nabbed at the earliest.

Those who catch him will be rewarded. It can be said that he is Vadodaraâ€™s â€˜most wantedâ€™ criminal now,â€� he said. Sinha said the fact that offences were registered against Golawala during the rioting in the city made it evident that he had a communal bent of mind. â€œHe was involved in arson and other such offences,â€� he added. Sources pointed out that Golawala belongs to a well-todo family.

His father had marble quarries in Rajasthan. â€œHe seems to have come contact with the underworld in 1991. He is believed to have harboured criminals of the Latif gang,â€� said inspector Panigate police station Bhagirathsinh Jadeja. Golawala is wanted in offences of rioting in the Wadi and Karelibag police station areas.

The city crime branch was on his trail over his alleged involvement in illegal arms trade. Golawala was also involved in an incident of private firing in the Panigate area some months ago. Another notorious criminal Lala Andawala was also involved in the incident. However, Andawala was subsequently nabbed by the police.

30,Haryana urges Centre to simplify labour laws,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana has urged the Centre to simplify labour laws and also reduce their number and raise by three times the amount of compensation which is given to a labourer at the time of his retrenchment.

These suggestions were made by the chief minister in his speech delivered at the 39th Indian Labour Conference that commenced in Delhi on Thursday.

Financial commissioner and principal secretary labour and employment Prem Prashant read out the speech as the chief minister himself could not attend the conference due to his preoccupations.

Stating that the Haryana government was strongly in favour of simplification of labour laws, he said that such labour laws should be made in accordance with the recommendations of the Second Labour commission.

He said that there were nearly 50 labour laws which needed to be reduced to five or six. Also, those industrial units which had less than 100 workers should have separate simple laws, suggested Chautala.

31,'Centre trying hard to destabilise state govt',"CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has alleged that the Union government, through its various agencies, has been making efforts to destabilise the Congress governments in various states, including Punjab.

While addressing a press conference here on Thursday, the chief minister hit out at the Union government saying that it has assigned a minister of Punjabi origin to create problems for his government.

Chhattisgarh CM Ajit Jogi, Karnatka CM S M Krishna and Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh had already complained of the Centre''s moves, he added.

Amarinder said that the Centre had been on the job of pulling down the Congress government for the last couple of months, but it had now gained momentum as the assembly elections to five states were approaching.

He clarified that the state Vigilance Bureau (VB) had not raided or photographed the Punjab minister Jasjit Singh Randhawa''s house in Mohali, which was under renovation. He categorically said that no Punjab government agency was involved in the raid, but some Central agencies were targeting his ministers.

However, Randhawa, while denying some news reports, said that no inquiries had been made on the expenses incurred on the ongoing renovation of his house.

The chief minister said that he had issued instructions to all Punjab government departments not to raid or touch any minister''s business concern or house without his prior consent.

Simultaneously, he issued a veiled threat to the Central agencies, saying, ""Any Central agency targeting his men should be caught hold of and brought before him and he would bring it before media"".

However, when asked if the agencies of the Union government, including the income tax department, won''t be permitted to function in Punjab, he tried to evade the question and said that he was aware who were being targeted by the Centre.

This threat appeared to be aimed at assuring his ministers that his government won''t target them. Also, he dismissed raid at another minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa''s house as a ""routine check up"".

The chief minister did not rule out the possibility of his government being targeted at the behest of the NDA ally Shiromani Akali Dal, whose president Parkash Singh Badal and other leaders were facing corruption charges in Punjab.

He denied that the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has served any notice to the Punjab government on the petition of Akali leaders.

""My understanding is that NHRC would intervene whenever there was violation of the fundamental rights. And indulging in corruption can''t be a fundamental right of the Akalis,"" quipped Amarinder in a sarcastic manner.

32,Punjab govt yet to release funds for sanitation project,"CHANDIGARH: The Rajiv Gandhi Rural Sanitation Project launched by Punjab government with much fanfare on his birth anniversary this year has proved stillborn as no funds have been released for it so far.

The ambitious and much publicised Rs 500 crore project was aimed to set up toilets in rural Punjab for the schedule caste and backward class families at a cost of Rs 5,500 per toilet.

The government had also identified its priority areas and decided to set up such toilets first in those villages having an overwhelming schedule caste population and then move on to the villages having Dalit and women sarpanches or where the panchayats had been elected unanimously.

The chief minister had announced at Rajiv Gandhi''s birth celebrations in Patiala that in all Rs 142 crore would be spent during the current financial year and Rs 162 crore in the next year for the sanitation project.

The project was to be completed in three years under which over ten lakh toilets were to be constructed in the entire rural Punjab.

Despite this categorical announcement, the state government has not released any amount for the project and most officials are tightlipped about its fate.

Officials in the department of planning said that no money had been kept for the project this year as it was conceived much after the annual plan was formulated and got the legislative sanction.

Obviously, the money had to be diverted from other areas which are yet to be identified.

Sources point out that the project has to be funded out of the allocations made under the various schemes for the rural development.

The nodal agency for the project panchayat and rural development department gets funds as share of the state taxes as per the recommendation of the second state finance commission and from the Union government as allocated by the 11th finance commission. Besides, there is special additional assistance from the Centre for the rural development.

In all, the department of rural development is allocated Rs 161 crore as share from state taxes and Rs 30.93 crore from the funds allocated out of the 11th finance commission.

Besides, it would get around Rs 20 crore as special central grant.

Officials point out that the available funds are plan specific and if the government decides to allocate massive funds to the tune of Rs 142 crore for the sanitation projects, all other priorities would go topsy-turvy.

Since the plan implementation is unlikely to exceed 75 to 80 per cent given the exacerbating fiscal crisis Punjab was facing, the state won''t be in a position even to release funds as per the second state finance commission report.

The net result would be the ambitious project would be the first casualty unless the government decide to divert all the funds of the rural development for the project and abandon all other schemes.

33,S-I close to Badal arrested in Delhi,"CHANDIGARH: While the filing of a challan against former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal is in its final stages, the Vigilance Bureau has upped the ante with the arrest of Chandigarh police sub-inspector Nirbhaijit Singh at the Delhi airport on Wednesday night and raids in Badal village to look for persons who had allegedly bribed the former CM.

A perturbed Badal told the Vigilance Bureau on Thursday that instead of hounding people who were close to his family, the VB might as well hand over the list of ""wanted"" persons ""once for all and they will be made available for questioning"".

Badal spoke out after the VB launched a renewed offensive in the case by seeking arrest warrants against four persons, including the SI, in connection with the corruption case against him and the police conducting raids at more than a dozen houses in Badal village in Muktsar district.

Following the early morning raids, the Muktsar police picked up three persons to be handed over to the VB. The Badal family''s charted accountant S S Kohli, Bhagwan Das and Anil Kumar, son of Harbans Lal, are the other persons against whom arrest warrants had been procured.

Sources said there were more than a dozen other persons, allegedly close to the Badal family, for whom the VB is likely to lay a trap in days to come. To prevent them from leaving the country, the VB might issue look-out notices for them at all the airports.

Earlier, at least three co-accused in the case, including Sukhbir Badal''s personal assistant Kewal Krishan, Badal''s former OSD Hardeep Singh and Bhupinder Dhillon fled the country which set back VB investigation.

Though in the Chandigarh police, Nirbhaijit remained on deputation with the Punjab police for almost five years during Badal''s term as chief minister and was posted at prime police stations as an SHO in different districts. Being close to the Badal family, the VB officials feel that he not only made money for himself but must have also helped the Badal family in its alleged clandestine deals.

The SI, known as ""Nippy"" among his friends, has reportedly also invested heavily in the Hindi film,Hawaaein,which was released recently.

The VB had earlier sent him notices to join the investigation in the corruption case against Badal and had also carried out raids to nab him. Incidentally, he took three years'' leave to go abroad when the VB pressure started mounting on the Badal family, following which the VB issued a look-out notice for him.

On Wednesday night, the Delhi police arrested him as he was about to board a flight. A VB team, led by DSP Manjit Singh, left for Delhi on Thursday to bring the S-I here.
