0,Sorabjee slams govt's failure to protect citizens,"AHMEDABAD: Avoiding a direct reference to the Gujarat government or its controversial role during the riots last year, Attorney General of India Soli Sorabjee stated that the failure of the administration to protect the citizens from riotous mobs was a mockery of justice.

He was speaking at a function â€œRole of Judiciary and Good Governanceâ€� organised by Ahmedabad Management Association here on Saturday.

Underscoring the need of judicial activism in the present era to counter the incompetence of the government, Sorabjee said there have been a number of instances where the judiciary has played an effective role in ensuring good governance amidst the notorious tardiness of the administration and continuous dereliction of duty by both executive and legislature.

â€œThe judiciary has also been effective in improving the quality of life of people which otherwise has been the duty of the administration,â€� said Sorabjee. He pointed out to the effective intervention of the judiciary in successfully implementing law to improve the environment by ordering closure of polluting units and issuing emission norms for vehicles to allow a better life to the citizens, as mentioned in the Constitution.

Apart from taking action in case of violation and non-implementation of law, the judiciary has been addressing issues of human rights as well, he said.

Though it cannot make law on its own, through its various rulings it has been widening the scope whereby issues of public interest can be addressed at a judicial forum. The judiciary liberalised the issue of locus standi, enabling the issues of the weaker sections of the society being taken up in larger public interest by individuals, who may not have a direct link with the issue.

â€œBut though PILs have been successful in addressing various issues of human rights and failure of the administration to enforce law, of late the liberty granted have made the PILs into personal, political and publicity interest litigation,â€� said the Attorney General.

When the interest of the various sections of the society has been not guarded due to various socioeconomic reasons, public interest litigations have been encouraged by the Supreme Court.

And they have taken care of issues like child-labour and determination of minimum wages, some of the Constitutional rights which had remained unaddressed.

Sorabji said that judiciary in the recent years have indeed been filling up the lacunae left by the administration in running the democratic set up. He also highlighted the role of the judiciary which made it compulsory for all candidates to disclose their assets and antecedents.

This again has been an laudable effort of the judiciary which empowers voters to know about the candidate they would be voting for, thereby making way for a possible good governance by electing deserving candidates, he added.

Further, stating that the â€œright to knowâ€� every action of the government is essential for the public, Sorabjee said that the judiciary to a certain extent have done its duty and said that cause should be taken further by citizens and advocates by using the medium of PILs.

1,BJP to avoid temple issue during polls,"AHMEDABAD: In the run-up to the Assembly polls in Jamalpur on December 1, the ruling BJP will shun controversial issues like construction of the Ram temple and rather highlight its achievements in areas of development.

The Congress, meanwhile, is determined to expose the Modi governmentâ€™s failure in tackling the law and order and spiralling prices of essential commodities.

The BJP candidate Laljibhai Parmar has launched his campaign by visiting various temples and Brahamakumaris HQ while the GPCC president Shankarsinh Vagehla will kickstart the campaign in minority-dominated Jamalpur on Monday.

Meanwhile, the BJP suffered a major loss when the Dalit leader Chaturdas Tundia resigned and joined the Congress, following denial of ticket. The Congress camp too is facing trouble and is making efforts to persuade Imtiyaz Devdiwala, son of late Usmangani Devdiwala, to withdraw his nomination in favour of partyâ€™s official candidate Khedawala Sabbir A Karim.

â€œWe have decided to highlight the local issues but at the same time the focus of attention will be on fight between secular and non-secular forces, particularly when communal forces have damaged the social fabric in Gujarat,â€� said senior Congress leader Navinchandra Ravani in-charge of the bye-election.

The Modi government has failed to curb the deteriorating law and order situation. The assassination of Haren Pandya and terrorist attack on Akshardham are glaring examples. In last few days, five persons have lost their lives in communal turmoil in Viramgam and Ahmedabad.

More than 25 incidents of robberies in banks and other establishments too have terrorised people.

City BJP president Dr Mayaben Kodnani denied reports that the Tundiaâ€™s resignation would affect the poll prospects of the party anyway.

â€œTundia was fielded by the party twice but both the times he was unsuccessful and there was no point in selecting him again.â€™â€™

Dr Kodnani said that for a change the party would not hold election meetings but prefer door-to-door campaign the beginning of which has already been made by law minister Ashok Bhatt in Kankaria ward.

Although senior leaders from both the BJP and Congress are heading for Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which also go for Assembly polls on December 1, tempo in Jamalpur keeps building up.

The BJP has assigned a battery of its Dalit leaders the job of canvassing in their respective areas and put Union minister of state for Home Harin Pathak incharge.

Meanwhile, senior leaders like Fakirbhai Waghela, Ratilal Verma and social welfare minister Ramanlal Vora will take on the Congress leaders in the ballot battle, which is being tipped as an acid test for Modi government.

2,Pirbahore protest a lesson for cops,"PATNA: Last weekâ€™s protest by residents of the Pirbahore area against police patronage to criminals and subsequent removal of Pirbahore police station officer-in-charge (OCs) Kamal Hasan came handy for Patna SSP to give a â€œlessonâ€� to the districtâ€™s police officers at the monthly crime meeting.

â€œEvery â€˜thanedarâ€™ must take a lesson from the incident... Patnaites can no longer be expected to tolerate anti-people attitude of the police. Check the supply of narcotics like smack and ganja besides growing market of illegal liquor,â€� a junior police officer quoted SSP Sunil Kumar as saying at the meeting.

The Pirbahore area has been in the news for all the wrong reasons in the recent past. Sabjibagh has become infamous as a major source of supply for smack and heroin in the city besides being a centre of â€œtappebaziâ€�, a unique form of crime, even though the police station is situated just in front of the Sabjibagh.

â€œInnocent attendants of PMCH patients are the main target of â€˜tappebazâ€™. â€œBusinessmen now hesitate to enter this area due to the fear of â€˜tappebazâ€™,â€� said a police officer of Pirbahore while explaining the impact of this crime on the economy of Sabjibagh and its adjoining areas, including Bakarganj and Hathua markets.

According to him, police patronage to the criminals ultimately led to a sharp decline in the number of visitors in this area for marketing purposes.

The Pirbahore incident, in the meantime, has also shaken the â€œfaithâ€� of city OCs in their political patrons.

Interestingly, the Pirbahore police station was probably the only police station in the state which till recently had a â€œgreenâ€� signboard, and not the usual red-blue police signboard, to display its name. Call it a conicidence but the fact remains the ruling RJDâ€™s flag is also green. The board was removed after the intervention of senior police officers.

â€œNo politician can go against popular will. Kamalâ€™s political patrons were the first to sense the intensity of the popular ire against him,â€� a senior police officer said. Policing in the city is also likely to undergo a transformation in coming days after the arrival of a fresh lot of police inspectors in Patna and discharge of the â€œold guardsâ€� whose transfers were ordered recently.

3,"8,000 teachers to be appointed after changing rules","PATNA: More than 8,000 teachers are to be appointed for government high schools in Bihar after changing the rules for appointment, according to junior minister for secondary, primary and adult education Ram Prakash Mahto.

He said the rules for appointment have to be amended to ensure that the candidates applying for such jobs need not have B.Ed. degree. â€œWe had made a commitment in 1991 to do away with the rules making it necessary for the candidates applying for such jobs to have B.Ed. degree,â€� the minister stressed. He said the amendments would be made soon, but he refused to give a timeframe.

He said in order to meet the standards set by the NCTE which makes it mandatory for the government to appoint trained teachers, the government would provide in-service training to the candidates selected on the basis of a written test. They would also be asked to engage classes. â€œWe will train them through a condensed course in batches,â€� he remarked, adding that there are 2,533 high schools in which the total number of the posts of teachers is around 30,000.

The minister said that almost half of the posts of headmasters are lying vacant and that they would be filled soon. â€œCurrently, 80 per cent of the headmasters are selected through promotion while the rest are appointed directly on the recommendation of the BPSC. There is a move to bring the number of directly appointed headmasters to 50 per cent,â€� he observed.

The minister announced that environment would be introduced as a compulsory subject at the high school and intermediate levels during the current academic session. â€œScience teachers are to be engaged to teach the subject. Later, we may appoint separate teachers.â€�

5,Hospitals flout referral rules,"KOLKATA: Moribund patients are supposed to be the priority for any hospital, according to a Supreme Court verdict.

However, the death of Badal Chakrabarty proved that the health department did not learn a lesson even after Sushmita Biswasâ€™ tragic death.

Sushmita, who died under similar circumstances, also had a renal failure and there was chaos in the process of referring the patient to other hospitals.

The referral protocol says that the hospital sending the patient should first call up the hospital of destination and ask whether a bed is available.

Badalâ€™s family knew little about the city and the doctors did not issue a written recommendation to any specific hospital to admit the patient.

So, the family failed to take him to any other hospital. Though the doctors claimed that they were told about shifting the patient elsewhere, it was just a verbal suggestion.

There was no explanation why the SSKM Hospital authorities did not care to speak to their counterparts at Shambhunath Pandit Hospital where they claimed to have referred Badal.

While the health department officials maintained that there was no negligence, they admitted that the referring out protocol was not followed properly. â€œWe are trying to develop the system where phone calls to an-other hospital would be mandatory while referring a patient,â€� said the superintendent and vice-principal of the hospital, Shantanu Tripathi.

Also, if a patient is referred out, he will have to be given a written recommendation explaining the need for shifting and the kind of ailment.

â€œThe hospital was too crowded on Saturday night. Even the floor space was full and the patient just could not be accommodated. His condition was also not as bad as it is made out to be,â€� said Tripathi.

6,Mufti govt told to pay Rs 2 lakh for custody death,"SRINAGAR: Implicating the Army in the custody killing of a youth, the Jammu and Kashmir Human Rights Commission has directed the state government to pay Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of the youth.

On May 25, 2001 Abdul Ahad Wani from Handwara in Kupwara district filed a case before the commission that his son Shamasudin Wani was picked up by the security personnel of 6 Rashtriya Rifles from his shop. Later, his body was â€˜blown up with an IED"".

Objecting to the Army''s reported non-cooperation in the investigation of such cases, the commission said: ""The modus-operandi of the Army of not subjecting itself to the authority of investigating agency is a tragic phenomenon.""

Two cars which he left abandoned after after stealing were now lying in the Sector 19 and Mohali police stations. One of the cars had been sold in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh which would also be brought back.

His modus operandi was targeting old models of Maruti car whose locks he found easy to open. Another reason for going in for old cars was that Vicky found it easy to disposed them of.

9,Stray incidents of violence mar Assam bandh,"GUWAHATI: Stray incidents of violence marred the 24-Assam bandh on Monday, called by the All Assam Students'' Union (AASU), and brought normal life to a halt in the state.

Two motor-bikes were torched while some private vehicles were forcibly seized in Jalukbari area near Guwahati University, sources said here on Monday.

A large number of Aasu activists gheraoed the North East Frontier Railway headquarters at Maligaon and prevented railway employees and officers from entering their offices.

A Railway spokesman said all trains left Guwahati Railway station on Monday morning as per schedule, but they have no information on whether the trains are stranded on the way.

10,Govt asks GEB to cut power if farmers don't pay,"GANDHINAGAR: It could not come at worse time for the farmers in the state. When the rabi crop is in full swing, the government has sent out clear instructions to the Gujarat Electricity Board to cut power to the farmers still refusing to pay their unmetered power bills, recently revised downwards by 30 per cent.

â€œThis is being done in response to just 10 per cent of the farm power bills having been recovered despite the leniency shown by the government, bringing down the power rates from Rs 1,050-1,200 per horse power (HP) per year to Rs 750-900,â€� a senior official told TNN here on Monday.

Meanwhile a Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) spokesperson, who acknowledged reports that the GEB had already begun cutting off power supply to errant farmers in Banaskantha district and villages near Kapadvanj, Kadi and Gandhinagar, said, â€œThis is following our instructions not to pay any bills at the revised rate of Rs 750-900. They can, however, pay the bills at the pre-June 1 rates of Rs 350-500 per HP.â€�

But, â€œOur instructions to the farmers not to pay power bills stands. GEB officials will face tough resistance from our cadres, hence it is not so easy to go ahead with cutting power everywhere,â€� he added.

A Sangh Parivar outfit, the BKS plans a state-level convention of its district and taluka level leaders on November 26 to chalk out plans to start an agitation against the reports of what it calls â€œharassment of farmers.â€� But government officials agree that there cannot be any better time to cut the power connections.

â€œThe farmers badly need power for the rabi crop. Although they get power for only seven to eight hours a day due to huge demand, they cannot afford to remain without power.

They will have to pay up,â€� an official said. The state decision to go in for industrial load-shedding on Saturday and Sunday was â€œguided by this increased demand from the farm sector for more powerâ€�, the official revealed, adding, â€œThe total demandsupply gap currently has reached 1,700 MW as against 1,200 MW last year about the same time.â€�

On Sunday, the day the CM inaugurated the new power plant at Dhuvaran, the demand peaked at 8,888 MW, and the supply was just 7,246 MW.

When contacted, admitting that the demand-supply gap cannot be overcome in a year, minister of state for power Saurabh Patel said,â€œWe will be a power surplus state within five years. Adequate and cheap power was the main theme of the function at Dhuvaran, where 107 MW gas-based power plant was commissioned and laid the foundation stone of another.â€�

â€œWe will be having new gas-based units at Uttaran and Pipavav and lignite-based plants at Pananadhro, Mangrol and Ghogha, apart from private power plants by the Surat Electricity Company and G-Pec. Then,we will be having our share from the NTPC, the Narmada dam and Chhattisgarh. All this will help us to sell power outside the state,â€� he added.

13,"Cornered over Babri stand, Mulayam sacks lawyer","LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: Under attack over its stand in the Supreme Court in the Babri Masjid demolition case, the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday said it had dismissed advocate R C Verma from its panel.

State chief secretary A P Singh said the government would file a supplementary affidavit to show there was no change in the government''s stand since 1993.

The Mulayam Singh Yadav government had filed an affidavit in the apex court defending the CBI''s supplementary chargesheet in which conspiracy charges against top BJP leaders were dropped. Mulayam Singh had, when in opposition, criticised the CBI for doing this.

The word ""wrong"" used in the affidavit to deny a conspiracy by a political party or community behind the demolition was not there in the original brief and was used by Verma, the chief secretary said.

An angry Opposition charged Mulayam Singh Yadav with ""playing a double game"" and being ""in pact with (Deputy PM L K) Advani"" for defending the supplementary chargesheet.

Congress spokesman Jaipal Reddy said if Mulayam did not revise his action, ""we will consider everything, including severing our ties with his government.""

The CPM also called the UP government''s stand as ""surprising and very unfortunate"".

BSP leader Rashid Alvi even went a step ahead and declared Mulayam as an ""agent of the BJP in UP"", and as one who ""has deceived the minorities"" by giving ""a clean chit to the BJP in the demolition case"".

Zaffaryab Jilani, convener of the All India Babri Masjid Action Committee and member of the All India Muslim Personal Board, said: ""We will protest and seek clarification as to why the UP CM had submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court claiming there was no criminal conspiracy in demolition of the mosque.""

The governor was also requested to provide a panel of names of IAS officers for being posted as collectors in these two districts.

Article 324(6) says: The President or the governor of a state shall at the EC''s request would make available to the EC or to a regional commissioner such staff as may be necessary for the discharge of the functions.
