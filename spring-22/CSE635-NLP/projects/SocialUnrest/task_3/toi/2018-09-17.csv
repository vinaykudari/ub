1,Discontinuation of midday-meal results in increased drop-out rates,"hyderabad: the abrupt closure of the midday-meal scheme, which was implemented by the education department in 25 government and zilla parishad primary and upper primary schools in and around the city, has increased the drop-out rate in these schools. the scheme, introduced in the year 1998, was stopped by the government after five months citing financial reasons. the midday-meal scheme, implemented on an experimental basis to provide succour to the students coming from poor families led to the increase in enrolment in all the 25 schools. several parents enrolled their children in these schools hoping that their wards will get a proper meal at least once in a day. however, for reasons best know to the officials, the education department abruptly stopped the schemes within months of its implementation, leading to the increase in drop outs. according to a teacher of zilla parishad high school for boy at yapral, ""as soon as the scheme came to a halt, several of the students, especially from primary sections, stopped attending classes."" however, in some of the schools, the students who were enrolled due to the scheme are still studying as they hope the scheme would continue. even, the plan of the education department to provide free school uniform and books to students belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes was also found to be a non-starter in many schools. in several schools the teachers gathered funds from various non-governmental organisations to purchase books for the students coming from poorer background. ""in most of the government and zilla parisahd schools, seats reserved for students belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes remained vacant as the parents preferred that their child should earn rather than go to school,"" a teacher of the zilla parishad school for girls at bolaram, said.

2,Congress has lost political credibility: Keshubhai,"ahmedabad: chief minister keshubhai patel, campaigning for the bjp for sabarkantha and sabarmati by-polls, continued his attack on the congress alleging that it has lost political credibility due to its own misdeeds. addressing election meetings in sabarkantha and sabarmati constituencies, patel said that the people have rejected the congress party for the unfair tactics and dishonest means adopted by it. as against this, the bjp government has proved that it was really working for the welfare of the people. the laying of drinking water pipeline for saurashtra had saved the people from several towns and cities from migrating for want of water. construction of checkdams have recharged watertables and eased the water crisis, about which the congress had never bothered all these years. he said that the bjp had smashed criminal gangs which were earlier being provided political patronage by congress. he added that the crime rate in gujarat came down considerably during the bjp regime, following effective remedial measures. senior bjp leader madanlal khurana also addressed election meetings in sabarkantha during his second tour of the constituency. union ministers kashiram rana and vallabhbhai kathiria were camping in himmatnagar for canvassing for party's candidate upendra trivedi.

5,Mob holds health minister captive for 2 hrs,"hajipur: in a bizarre incident, an unruly mob of around 2,000 villagers and attendants of patients held health minister shakuni choudhary and about a dozen health officials, including vaishali civil surgeon dr pranava kumar, captive for two hours in protest against the distribution of expired medicines on saturday. the flag of the minister's car was torn by the angry mob and a tyre damaged. according to official sources, a day-long health fair was organised at the khajchand referral hospital for rural patients. the minister was scheduled to visit the fair. the situation took an ugly turn when choudhary, accompanied by health officials, reached there quite late. a number of patients, including children, were examined at the fair and old and expired medicines donated by local doctors and others, were distributed among them. when the attendant of one of the patients noticed this, the people became agitated and held the minister captive for two hours in his car, said the chairman of district board, umesh prasad rai, who was present at the fair. rai said the mob started raising slogans against the civil surgeon and others for distributing expired medicines. lack of seating arrangements at the fair also angered the villagers, said a health official adding the total mismanagement there led to the humiliation of the minister. the health minister has suspended the in-charge of the referral hospital, r s choubey, and the drug inspector, neelam kumari, for not checking the medicine before distribution. an inquiry has been instituted against the cs also. however, neither the health minister nor the cs could be contacted for their versions. the district magistrate, vaishali, gautam goswami, confirmed the incident.

6,Panel urged to include power projects in 10th Plan,"patna: the state government has urged the members of the parliamentary sub-committee for power sector, who came here on friday to know the latest position regarding the proposed super thermal power project at nabinagar in aurangabad district, to include this scheme as also the barh mega-power project in the 10th five-year plan itself.

a formal request to this effect was made to the sub-committee at its friday meeting with bihar government officials, including chief secretary mukund prasad, energy secretary sudhir kumar, bihar state electricity board (bseb) chairman c m jha and bseb member (generation) a k vishwakarma, and representatives of the national thermal power corporation (ntpc).

the ntpc representatives said it (ntpc) would have no objection to taking up the nabinagar power project if it gets the green light from the union government. the project is estimated to cost more than rs 8,000 crore.

the nabinagar power project, which had been approved by the central electricity authority in 1989, was shelved by the union government for being taken up in the 11th five-year plan.

both the ntpc and bseb sources said due to its location the power produced by the nabinagar plants will be cheaper than that by the barh plants. the north karnapura mines, from where both the power stations are to get coal supply, are closer to nabinagar as compared to barh and hence the nabinagar power station will have to pay less transportation cost. the nabinagar project site is located on the state forest department land, which will be available easily. even private land near the site will be available at cheaper rates because only paddy and maize crops are grown on this for want of proper irrigation facilities, the sources said.

the land at the barh project site, which has proper irrigation facilities, is costlier as three crops a year are grown there. hence the acquisition of land there would also be difficult. even from the technical point of view nabinagar is a better site, the sources added.

8,Stripped woman heaps abuse on govt,"bellary: publicly shamed dalit woman yerramma, from vanenur village in bellary district, who was stripped and paraded naked in public by upper caste men recently, said here on monday that the government should take the blame for what happened to her. steps should be taken to ensure that promises made to her did not remain ""lip sympathy"", she added. she told reporters that her family was scattered and they were living like they had been thrown into the jungles. it was not easy any more for her two sons to go to work. her husband lived in bellary, virtually guarding her at the sc/st hostel where she was staying on return from hospitalisation in bangalore. ""since the authorities will not allow him to stay in the hostel at night, he has to find shelter somewhere else"". she said taken aback by public antipathy over what happened to her, the government had promised to construct a house wherever she wanted, promised her a government job and full security. but nothing has happened to date. she said her sons no longer come out in public and are fed secretly by their grandmother in vanenur village. and her husband was the most worried person, she added. equally critical of her own community in the village, she said, no one, of the 40 families in the village, came to her rescue and did not raise a whimper of protest against the humiliating incident. ""now they are enjoy the benefits. the government must stop all benefits sanctioned to the community in the village immediately"". yerramma doesn't want to return tovanenur. she requested the government to give her a house in town. she refused the authorities' offer to allot her a house in dc nagar temporarily. her husband yerriswamy who has been by his wife's side through the painful period, and who was a former councillor, said dc nagar was known to be a place for sex workers, and it was not advisable for the family to stay there after the humiliation his wife was put through. ""if someone propositions her and knocks on our door in the night, will the government take responsibility for the consequences,"" he asked. as for a job for his wife, yerriswamy said, there was a proposal to place her as the cook in the hostel. ""we are not opposed to it, but she must get her appointment order through the right channels."" yerriswamy said dalits and progressive parties of the community planned to launch an indefinite relay hunger-strike from september 23 if the government did not take immediate steps to rehabilitate yerramma and her family. meanwhile, the dalit groups are divided on the yerramma incident and both groups are exploiting the issue to their own mileage. the two groups are, one supporting yerriswamy and his followers, and the other, a group of dalits supporting the bahujan samaj party and its local leaders. yerriswamy alleged that former bsp district president panduranga was making a mess of the issue. he alleged panduranga and his men were indirectly supporting culprits of the incident, as they were his clients. panduranga is a practising lawyer in town. yerriswamy said dalits owing allegiance to bsp were not the real dalits. he said the rally they were organising on tuesday, was not acceptable to others.
