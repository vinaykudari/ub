0,RTC buses run riot on city roads,"HYDERABAD: Buses of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) were involved in 26 accidents this January alone.

Three of these accidents resulted in deaths. In spite of this, the management has not made any concrete plans to curb such accidents and rash driving by its drivers. Until last year, the average number of accidents involving RTC buses was 269.

But there has been a spurt in accidents resulting in fatalities in recent months. Of 42 such accidents caused by heavy vehicles during October-November 2003, 17 were hit-and-run or ''hit-from-behind'' incidents involving RTC buses.

Accidents involving RTC buses have resulted in four deaths since January 2004.

The normal practice of the RTC is to send erring drivers for training for a week or two depending on the gravity of the accident.

However, in spite of training, if the driver is still found to be drive rashly, then the training will continue but without wages. ""We have not been implementing cancellation of wages for drivers sent to any of the six training colleges. We will be strict on that front henceforth,"" a senior official of APSRTC said.

Also, experts will be engaged to train drivers on road safety as was done in the case of training for fuel-efficiency, he said.

More than one lakh employees will finish two-day sessions under the ''Make a difference'' campaign which will end in March, after which a general change in attitude is expected, he added.

2,Lok Sabha polls: SAD names 4 candidates,"CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday announced the names of four candidates from Punjab for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. Former state finance minister Kanwaljit Singh will contest from Patiala while another former minister, Rattan Singh Ajnala, will be the party candidate from Tarn Taran, former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal said here. Naresh Gujral, the son of former Prime Minister, I K Gujral, will be the party nominee from the Jalandhar seat while Paramjit Kaur, the daughter of former Union education minister Dhanna Singh Gulshan, will don the party's colours from Bathinda. The SAD has already announced the candidature of Union minister of chemicals and fertilisers, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, from the Sangrur parliamentary constituency, taking the total number of its candidates to five. Badal said the names were announced after wide consultations with senior SAD leaders, including Gurcharan Singh Tohra. He denied that there was any factional in-fighting in the party over nominations. ''There are not factions in the party and I have the highest regard for Tohra,'' he added. Former chief minister said negotiations were on with the BJP on seat-sharing for the remaining eight seats in the state but added that so far no talks had been held on seat-sharing with that party. On almost all other issues that could be raised in the parliamentary polls, Badal's response dovetailed those being aired by the BJP. For example, on the issue of prime ministership, Badal said his party would like to see an experienced leader at the helm of the country and in this respect Vajpayee had far more experience that Sonia Gandhi. He also alluded to Sonia's foreign origin and said the Prime Minister should be an Indian-born person. The SAD chief said that his party would raise issues confronting the state in the elections and these would include corruption in the government, the failure of the present state government on ''all fronts'' and the step-motherly treatment meted out to Punjab by successive Congress governments at the Centre during the 45 years of their rule.

3,Parents protest hike in pre-primary school fee,"MUMBAI: Parents of more than 300 pre-primary children in Kangaroo Kids, a Cuffe Parade playschool, are up in arms against the school''s decision to hike the fees of pre-primary and primary sections.

For instance, the fee for senior KG has been hiked from Rs 28,000 per annum to Rs 31,000, with an additional deposit of Rs 5,000.

The deposit was non-refundable, but after parents protested, it was made refundable, only for parents of existing students. According to a circular, when parents admit their wards to the school directly, the deposit money won''t be refunded.

The school claimed that the fee for nursery and junior KG has been hiked from Rs 26,000 to Rs 28,000 per annum. The fee for grade I and grade II also has been hiked from Rs 31,000 to 35,000.

A parent told TNN that his son had studied in the senior KGof KangarooKids at a fee of Rs 27,000 and for grade I, the school was demandingRs 40,000, including the refundable deposit.

Another parent said that G.D. Somani School, which conducted primary education, discontinued class I and class II and this was now being run by Kangaroo Kids. G.D. Somani School''s primary education fee was Rs 17,500.

""Now, after the Kangaroo Kids'' takeover, we end up paying double the fee,"" said a parent whose daughter will be promoted from senior KG to grade I this year. However, Lina Ashar, who runs Kangaroo Kids, said that the parents were earlier informed that KangarooKids would take charge of classes I and II.

""We told them at the time of admissions to pre-primary level,"" she said. ""We justify the fees we charge. Each class has only 25 students supervised by two teachers, unlike other schools, which have 50 to 60 children in a class staffed by one teacher. Our classrooms are air-conditioned and our teachers are well paid. Basically, they are getting quality education for a price,"" Ms Ashar said.

Claiming that only a small group of parents were complaining, she said, ""Out of 900 parents, more than 700 have already paid the fees."" When informed that around 350 parents had signed a memorandum protesting the hike, she responded that it could be because of ""mob mentality"".

The parents have taken the matter to Forum for Fairness in Education. The forum''s president, Jayant Jain, said the school''s demand for a non-refundable deposit amounted to asking for a donation or capitation fee.

""Donation is a cognisable offence and the school authorities could be behind bars for it,"" he said.

Ms Ashar said that it was an error on the part of the school management to use the word ''non-refundable deposit''. ""It should have been termed as admission fee. But since it was a mistake, we have made it refundable now.""

4,State govt drops Pota charges against 29,"MUMBAI: In a significant development, the state government has dropped charges under the stringent Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) against 29 people.

The decision follows the recommendation of a high-level committee set up to look into cases filed under the Act.

Home minister R R Patil told mediapersons on Friday that the charges were dropped against the accused involved in two cases, one of them the Solapur communal riots.

The high-level committee comprised the newly-appointed additional chief secretary (home) Suresh Kumar, law secretary, director general of police and the commissioner of Mumbai police.

When Pota was invoked against members of a particular community for their alleged involvement in the Solapur rioting last year, there was widespread unrest against the Democratic Front government.

5,State govt now goes without chopper,"PATNA: With the crash of its seven-seater helicopter on Thursday, the Bihar government is now left with no working chopper. DGP W H Khan and three other senior state government officials had a miraculous escape when the helicopter carrying them crashed at Munger.

The Bihar government had got two French-made helicopters in 1989 with the capacity of carrying a maximum weight of 4,000 kg with passengers. The chopper which crashed was reportedly being overused since the other one has remained grounded for the last several years for want of necessary repair, said Avinash K Sinha, chief pilot-cum-director a the civil aviation department, Bihar.

The chief minister is also not allowed to use government chopper during electioneering according to the model code of conduct. ""In any case, the chief minister had to hire chopper during election campaign,"" said a senior official.

Before the enforcement of the code of conduct, the state government has to hire chopper for flying to interior areas of the state.

""We have no option left because the condition of roads in Bihar is pathetic,"" said another senior official.

The economic affairs committee of the state cabinet has already approved the proposal for purchasing a new chopper for the Bihar government, sources said. But the government is yet to purchase a new chopper.

The crash has put a question mark on the airworthiness and maintenance of the only working chopper the Bihar government had got. It was in great demand among VIPs.

""We were unable to meet the frequent demand made by VIPs to use the chopper in connection with various government programmes,"" said an official. The lack of proper communication between district administration and the civil aviation department sometimes put pilots in a fix.

The pilots faced this problem when chief minister Rabri Devi went on tour to Shitalpur (Saran) by the same chopper in June last year. The pilot in command observed in the air that a couple of helipads existed at Shitalpur village only at a distance of one km.

The pilots conferred for a short while and landed the helicopter on the helipad which they thought to be comparatively better and safe.

In fact, there was no one at this helipad to receive the CM. It happened because the plan of the district administration had not been communicated to the civil aviation department, sources said.

6,Union minister justifies campaigns,"PATNA: Information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad here on Sunday justified the ""India on the Move"" and ""India Shining"" campaigns of the NDA government, saying that they would be stopped the day model code of conduct is enforced by the Election Commission.

Making a strong defence of the campaigns, Prasad said their contents are based on facts and nobody has challenged them. The campaigns do not criticise anyone, including the opposition, he added.

He said during the last five years, 2,148 km of national highways (NHs) has been constructed in Bihar, increasing the total length of NHs in the state to 3,404 km. Apart from it, 2,027 km of NHs has been improved and widened under various Central schemes at a cost of more than Rs 454 crore, he maintained.

The NDA government has sanctioned more than Rs 132 crore from the Central Road Fund for improving state highways and district roads in Bihar. It has identified three proposals worth more than Rs 21 crore under the scheme for improving roads of economic importance, according to the booklet ""NDA government''s assistance to Bihar"".

The booklet says the railway workshop being set up at Harnaut in Nalanda district at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore will overhaul 50 coaches per month and generate employment for 2,000 persons, besides creating indirectly hundreds of jobs in the region. A memorandum of understanding has been signed between the railway ministry and the National Thermal Power Corporation for setting up a 1,000-MW captive power plant as a joint venture at Nabinagar at an estimated cost of Rs 4,370 crore.

The railway ministry sanctioned more than Rs 6,437 crore for new lines, three mega projects, gauge conversion and electrification in Bihar of which Rs 947 crore has already been spent.

The modernisation and expansion of the Barauni refinery has been approved. It includes increase in refinery capacity from 3.3 to 6 million tonnes and completion of the 754-km Barauni-Kanpur pipeline at a cost of Rs 1,800 crore, the booklet adds.

Replying to a question, Prasad said the Centre would not waive the loans given to the Bihar government unless it improves its performance on development and other fronts.

7,Cong assesses party's election prospects,"PATNA: In view of the forthcoming parliamentary elections, members of the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) and district presidents gathered at the party headquarters, Sadaquat Ashram, here on Sunday to discuss the prevailing situation and assess the party''s prospects.

The marathon meeting was held in two phases. In the first phase, the participants were BPCC members, district presidents and heads of the party''s various wings. The state unit''s senior leaders also participated and included senior leader and former Union minister L P Sahi.

While BPCC president Ram Jatan Sinha presided, AICC secretary and in charge of Bihar affairs Iqbal Singh as well as AICC coordinators D P Rai and Hassan Ahmad were also present on the occasion.

The participants adopted three-point resolution. They condemned the ""feel-good factor"" that was being drummed about by the NDA through advertisements in the media at the cost of public money and demanded honourable participation of the party during the parliamentary elections in the state, implying that the seat-sharing should be done honourably. Besides, the participants felt that AICC president Sonia Gandhi should make a tour of the state.

Iqbal Singh appreciated the militancy shown by the partymen in the state and also upheld efforts being made by Sinha. Speaking on the occasion, the BPCC president detailed the efforts made by him to rejuvenate the state unit. Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Vijay Shankar Dubey said the state Congressmen want honourable participation in the parliamentary elections.

The meeting is being considered significant because the Congress, which is an alliance partner of the RJD, among a few other parties, in its campaign against the NDA at the Centre, has staked claim on 22 parliamentary seats. To add to its upbeat mood, the Delhi High Court has absolved former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of all charges levelled against him by the CBI in the Bofors case.

Among others who also spoke on the occasion were L P Shahi, Arun Kumar, former Speaker of the state assembly Radha Nandan Jha, senior leaders Hedayatullah Khan, D P Yadav, Baleshwar Ram and Mahavir Choudhary, among others.

8,'Innovative tech helps farmers boost output',"PATNA: A media workshop was organised here by Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) on Sunday to highlight how the farmers have adopted innovative technology in the field of agriculture which has helped them to cultivate babycorn, earn lakhs of rupees from horticulture, and are now gearing up for the second green revolution â€” the dream of President A P J Kalam.

ATMA project director K M Singh said that the workshop was aimed at creating awareness about the innovation in technology dissemination component of National Agricultural Technology Project.

He said a florist, Surendra Kumar of Dihri village of Bihta, is earning Rs 1 lakh per annum only from cultivating cactus, bonsai and different types of flowers while a women''s interest group at Bihta is earning Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per month from growing marigold.

Likewise, Vijay Kumar of Ajwan block of Naubatpur is earning good money from cultivating medicinal plants. Lemon grass is also being grown by some farmers which is used by cosmetic manufacturers. The oil of lemon grass has market potential and sold at Rs 400 per kg.

ATMA, on its part, is taking steps to empower farmers through formation of farmer interest groups, farmers'' organisation, and commodity interest groups.

It identifies location specific needs of the farming community, facilitates marketing and sets up priorities for sustainable agricultural development.

9,HRD minister misled; PGI in trouble over CBMR,"LUCKNOW: Doctors at the SGPGI are worried, as are of institutes â€˜remotelyâ€™ related to the â€˜Centre for Biomedical Magnetic Resonance (CBMR)â€™ controversy caused by HRD minister MM Joshiâ€™s apparently arbitrary decisions.

A senior doctor revealed that Joshi was misled at a high-power committee meeting on January 28 into believing that the â€˜Centre of Interdisciplinary Studies in Bio-medical and Social Sciencesâ€™ proposed by the CBMR in charge Dr CL Khetrapal was approved by the Academic Board. Interestingly, added the senior doctor, he was also made to believe that both centres were the same.

Ironically, on being approved for Rs 20.5 crore funding and subsequent release of Rs 3.2 crore for the interdiscplinary centre, pressure was put to start work without approval, said the senior doctor. Director SGPGI, now Prof Kartar Singh, was asked to give reasons for the delay.

When even the CSIR sought explanation, Prof Singh wrote, explaining that delay was caused as the particular centre had not been approved by the Academic Board. Also, Prof Singh sought advice as to whether the Rs 3.2 crore should be returned. This was twisted to sound as if Prof Singh was asking for the centre to be relocated, he added. The high-power committee meeting was convened on January 28 under the chairmanship of Joshi. During the meeting, a particular section reportedly held sway over Joshi. It was decided that ""the centre will be taken away from the SGPGI and established as an Autnomous Inter-University Centre by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and that the proposal will be put at the UGC meeting to be held on February 24.

Meanwhile, after a report was published in this paper giving an account of various irregularities in Dr Khetrapalâ€™s appointment as distinguished professor and Joshiâ€™s attitude over these irregularities and on the CBMR issue, the director of the Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute (Allahabad) RC Tripathi came to the HRD ministerâ€™s rescue.

In a letter faxed to the paper, Dr Tripathi claims how ""the work and activities of the CBMR have been carried out with the approval and support of the governing council and other bodies of the SGPGI as well as other funding agencies. Upon the decision of central funding agencies and the SGPGI bodies in 2003 to further strengthen and develop the CBMR under Phase-II as an inter-institutional and inter-disciplinary centre, the SGPGI gave written assurance for the centreâ€™s (continued) location and sustenance at the SGPGI.""

Also, Tripathiâ€™s saying that the chairman of the governing council gave his clearance, with the concurrence of the present director for creating five faculty positions for the CBMR ""is again mixing two issues"", says the doctor, ""when the document reveals that the present director had only sought permission to take the matter to the governing body"".

10,War widow victim of political greed,"LUCKNOW: Krishnawati of Rae Bareli has been knocking the doors of officials and ministers for the past two years to get a piece of land in her home district, all without success. Wife of Surendra Bahadur Yadav, who sacrificed his life in a border skirmish in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir in 2001, is keen to open a school to honour the wish of her late husband.

Aware of Yadavâ€™s gallantry in the battle field, a special secretary in the chief ministerâ€™s secretariat, put up a note on the petition of Krishnawati to expedite the work at the earliest. The note clearly said that till this request was honoured, no one should be given gram sabha land in the district.

But the district officials had no intention of giving any land to the wife of Yadav. The land earmarked for her in Mehndiganj village of Salone tehsil went to others, known for their political clout in the government. This left Krishnawati in utter grief and she sought the assistance of voluntary groups to start a school. Now unless the widow was given the land, how would she proceed to open the school in Rae Bareli, said Zafar Naqvi.

In this connection, it may be mentioned here that the then director of education had sought details from the district officials so that necessary decision could be taken in this case. When in mourning, Krishnawati stumbled upon a statement of the then chief minister that Kargil victims and other army officials who laid down their lives while serving the country would be offered help to honour their dead husbands in every possible way.

""The government had set up even Kargil villages but when a widow is ready to arrange funds to start a school, the government has gone back on its words,"" said Naqvi. ""This is no way to honour our dead heroes,"" said a senior citizen.

11,48 injured on way to DYFI rally,"KOLKATA: At least 48 people sustained injuries in Hooghlyâ€™s Raghunathpur when a bus carrying them to DYFIâ€™s Brigade rally on Sunday turned turtle. The accident took place as the driver lost control over the vehicle.

The injured were admitted to a local hospital. Barring this mishap, no untoward incident was reported during the rally. Contrary to estimation that four lakh DYFI activists would throng the Brigade on Sunday, just a couple of lakhs did.

Though they succeeded in choking central and south Kolkata for several hours, commuters were spared the harrowing ordeal of previous such rallies. All arterial roads leading to Brigade witnessed bumper-to-bumper traffic for four hours since noon as rallyists made their way in private buses and trucks.

The worst, however, was along the Ashutosh Mukherjee Road and J.L. Nehru Road. The cops had to divert a few routes along that stretch. Heavy traffic was also witnessed along the S.N. Banerjee Road, Strand Road and Brabourne Road.

The police said unusual heavy traffic had also hit the AJC Bose Road and Central Avenue. Joint commissioner of police (Traffic) Banibrata Basu, however, said, There were no major disruptions in traffic since morning.â€� The rallyists, however, turned a blind eye to the Calcutta high court directive banning the use of plastics in the Maidan. Even hours after they left, several plastic cups were left scattered on the grounds.

12,MCD flip-flop on farmhouses not new,"NEW DELHI: The Municipal Corporation of Delhi''s latest turnaround on the issue of farmhouses hosting weddings does not come as a surprise.

Two days after submitting an affidavit to the Delhi High Court banning weddings in farmhouses, the corporation said partying is fine with a fine of Rs 40,000.

Every season there are thousands of weddings in farmhouses. In fact, last year there were 1,200 in just one day in December.

Banquet halls are booked over three months in advance during the wedding season between October and January.

While neighbours suffer because of the noise pollution and drunken brawls, hosts are constantly under threat of being harassed by MCD officials and the local police.

13,PWG attacks raise poll violence risk,"NEW DELHI: The looting of three police armouries in Koraput on Thursday by suspected PWG cadre has raised the spectre of extremist violence during the upcoming elections in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.

The authorities suspect that the activists who got away with a huge cache of arms from the town situated close to the Orissa-AP border could use the arsenal to enforce their poll boycott call.

The PWG, which recently attempted to assassinate Andhra chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, had vowed to retaliate against the resultant police action by stepping up its version of ""class war"", often marked by indiscriminate violence against all sorts of ""class enemies"".

The PWG, which is no longer able to attract new recruits the way it could till the mid-80s, has been relying on acts of violence which can serve as statements of its continuing strength. Andhra Pradesh is among the states where the Centre expects poll violence.

The group, which raided the three police stations, escaped with 500 rifles and revolvers, 35 stenguns and 26,000 rounds of ammunition, boosting the anxiety level of the authorities.

14,IIM-A works on plan to double farm output,"NEW DELHI: At a time when HRD Minister Murli Manohar Joshi has been hammering away at IIMs, one of these prestigious institutes has been quietly giving shape to a government roadmap to ""double"" the country''s food production â€” and farm incomes â€” in under a decade.

IIM-Ahmedabad''s agriculture centre is to give its report later this month. But along with the agriculture ministry''s own thinking on this, a basic outline of its suggestions is expected to be up for discussion at a two-day conference on the upcoming Kharif campaign, starting Monday.

States, too, had been asked to give their views but their feedback is said to be ""not very encouraging"".

The ministry, which farmed out the job to IIM a few months ago, is expecting a detailed action plan sector by sector, crop by crop, to race ahead as India''s population gallops, its food needs increase and change nuance.

For instance, projections on requirements for a particular crop, internal consumption and export demand, the growth rate possible or desirable, the kind of interventions needed to achieve this.

15,Cong protests AIIMS advt; to move EC,"NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to the health Ministry advertisement with regard to establishment of 12 AIIMS within a year by the NDA government, Congress on Monday said this was a ""crude"" way of propagating something which was ""blatantly"" wrong and it would approach the Election Commission to stop it.

Accusing the Government of ""misusing taxpayers'' money"" through a ""misleading"" advertisement, senior party leader Pranab Mukherjee said that the advertisement says only one All India Institute of Medical sciences came up during the past 50 years while the NDA would provide 12 AIIMS in one year.

""My question is where are these 12 AIIMS and where have they been established,"" he said, adding that Finance Minister Jaswant Singh while presenting the interim budget had merely referred to the proposal ""which is nothing but an expression of intention.""

The former Finance Minister said he would not have reacted so if the BJP-led NDA government had announced in the budget about the establishment of AIIMS and wanted to know ""where is the money for the AIIMS. There is no mention of any money for them (AIIMS) in the interim budget but still advertisements are being issued.""

Branding the advertisements as ""mere propaganda"", Mukherjee said the party would like Election Commission to intervene and stop this type of ""vulgarity"".

17,Advani can't use IAF planes for electioneering: Cong,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday opposed NDA Government''s plea to the Election Commission to allow Deputy Prime Minister use IAF planes for electioneering.

""L K Advani is a Miniter like any other Minister and there is no mention of Deputy PM in the Constitution and thus he cannot be given this facility,"" senior party leader Pranab Mukherjee told reporters here.

Quoting a newspaper report, Mukherjee said ""Government has sought permission from the Election Commission that Advani should be accorded the same facilities as is available to Prime Minister. We are strongly opposed to the suggestion by the BJP-led NDA government"".

He said the Deputy PM had no constitutional status as the Constitution did not mention about the post of Deputy Prime Minister. It spoke only about the Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers.

""Advani is one of the Union Ministers holding Cabinet rank. Therefore, the privileges available to Prime Minister cannot be extended to the Deputy PM,"" he said.

Rules and provisions of Election Commission have been evolved over a period of time and the Prime Minister enjoys special constitutional status and that is why these privileges cannot be extended to others, Mukherjee said.

Asked if the Congress would go to Election Commission, he said ""Definitely. EC should reject their plea.""

18,'Show policy on lease of govt houses',"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Monday asked if there was a policy under which vacant government bungalows in Lutyens'' Delhi were being frequently leased out for weddings.

Justice Vikramjit Sen raised the issue during the hearing of a petition in which six farmhouse-owners had approached the high court against the Municipal Corporation of Delhiâ€™s (MCD) order to seal them.

Advocate for the farmhouse-owners R K Saini alleged that the MCDâ€™s approach was arbitrary since the corporation had recently decided to go slow against farmhouses holding weddings and parties. The MCD had earlier stated that weddings were not permitted in farmhouses. On Monday, it sought more time to file a fresh affidavit.

Additional standing counsel for MCD Anoop Bagai said: â€˜â€˜On Friday night, the Lieutenant-Governor cleared guidelines according to which farmhouses have been permitted to hold weddings if they pay Rs 40,000. Since guidelines on what kind of farmhouses would be allowed to hold

functions are yet to be decided, we asked for more time.â€™â€™

While giving consent to their request, Sen also asked for a policy regarding the vacant bungalows of members of parliament. He made it clear that until a new policy was formed, the corporation should not seal the six farmhouses which had approached the court.

On Bagaiâ€™s submissions, Sen said that if the policy was implemented before the next date of hearing, the farmhouses will have to follow it.

19,Custody for 13 arrested in Bilkis case extended,"AHMEDABAD: A local court here on Monday extended the judicial custody of the 13 people arrested in the Bilkis Banu gangrape and murder case till February 20. The arrested include a BJP worker from Dahod and a head-constable.

All the accused, who were kept at the Sabarmati Central Jail here, were produced before an in-charge magistrate of a special fast-track court on Monday. Of the accused, 12 will be produced before the special fast-track court of judge S M Padhyay on February 20 for hearing of CBIâ€™s application, which seeks to conduct scientific tests on them.

Apart from an identification parade of the accused, the tests will include lie-detector and truth serum tests. Meanwhile, a local court recently rejected the anticipatory bail plea of three senior policemen who were feared arrest in the case. After the state government had closed the sensational case for lack of evidence, the CBI reopened it and began investigation in January at the behest of orders from the Supreme Court.

During its probe the CBI not only arrested the 12 persons from various parts of Limkheda taluka of the district but also began an extraordinary excavation in the Pannivel forests to extract the bodies of those who were massacred by a mob on March 3, 2002. The CBI, who managed to exhume the skeletal remains of four persons including that of a child, has sent it for DNA tests for confirmation.

The investigating agency has also procured photographs of nine persons of Banuâ€™s family who were killed from a local photographer, employed by the police to click the corpses before burial. The photographer said did not know whose corpses they were. Banu, the crucial witness of the case has alleged that 14 of her 18 relatives who had fled their village were trapped near Chapparwad only to be hacked to death by a mob of around 500 people. Gujarat police, however, had said only seven persons were killed and had declared seven â€˜missingâ€™.
