2,"State govt anti-minority, says Rana's lawyer","AHMEDABAD: Hashim Qureshi, the lawyer representing owner of the Remo group Zahir Rana who has been accused of indulging in a fraud of Rs 70 crore, has accused the state government of harbouring anti-minority feelings.

Rana was booked under section 420 and 405 of the IPC after H B Pandya, a member of his multi-level-marketing schemes, lodged a complaint with the police on May 24, claiming that he had been cheated of the promised sum of Rs 626 by Remo Marketing Pvt Ltd. Qureshi called a press conference on Sunday, to tell the media that his client is being penalised by the state government because he belongs to the minority community.

Rana, on his part, has moved the Gujarat High Court for the case to be quashed under section 482 of CrPC.

â€œThe complaint is frivolous and seems to have been generated by some vested interests working against my client,â€� said Qureshi.

â€œThe state home department has been trying to influence the legal process by issuing press statements. On the day when Ranaâ€™s bail petition was to be moved, home minister Amit Shah made statements against the company. The same was repeated when the CID officials applied for remand,â€� alleged Qureshi. He added, â€œAt such an early stage of investigation, the state government should refrain from making derogatory statements against my client. This will adversely affect the public money that has been invested in Remo.â€�

However, the lawyer claimed that of the Rs 58-crore invested by its 33 lakh members in â€˜recharge for freeâ€™ scheme of the multi-level marketing operator, Rs 48 crore has already been repaid.

â€œThe fact that the economic offencesâ€™ cell of CID (crime) has control of investigations in this case is unjustified. As per norms, CID (crime) should only handle cases that involve fraud of Rs 50 lakh or more. Here, if at all there is breach of trust, then Pandyaâ€™s complaint involves a much smaller sum. On the other hand, Pandya has been paid Rs 1.61 lakh by cheque for the sum of Rs 5,500 that he and his family members have invested in the company,â€� the lawyer pointed out.

â€œGoing by the manner in which this case is being handled, one is forced to conclude that there is some personal and vested interests attached to the Remo case. There are so many other multi-level marketing companies operating in Gujarat. If they have not been penalised, why just pick on the Remo Group of Companies ?â€� he said. Qureshi said that senior legal experts had been consulted before the company had been registered in 1995, under the Companiesâ€™ Act of 1956. According to them, this form of business is legal.

4,AP govt did nothing on Paragodu: CWC,"HYDERABAD/BANGALORE: In a sensational disclosure, Central Water Commission (CWC) member S K Das said on Sunday that the Andhra Pradesh government, despite its many loud protests, has not formally asked for a halt to the construction of the Paragodu project nor filed a case in the Supreme Court against it.

This was hotly contested by AP irrigation minister Kadiam Srihari who insisted the state has indeed filed a petition in the Supreme Court but it had not come up for hearing as the court was in vacation.

Das, an additional secretary in the Union ministry of water resources, was in Hyderabad on Sunday as party of a CWC team to look into the state governmentâ€™s complaints that Karnataka was violating several inter-state river water accords.

Talking to reporters after meeting state irrigation officials, Das said the AP government had so far not demanded that Karnataka be stopped from going ahead with the Paragodu project.

Pointing out that AP had also not filed a case in the Supreme Court on the issue, Das said, â€œThe CWC would not be involved had the case been referred to the Supreme Court.â€™â€™

He said the AP government had only expressed â€˜concernâ€™ about the construction of Paragodu and sought details of the project.

About the submissions made to him by AP officials on Sunday, the CWC member, who would be going to the Paragodu site and meet Karnataka government officials on Monday, said: â€œI have heard one side and will listen to the other side.â€™â€™ He said the CWC would act as a mediator and facilitator and ensure â€œfair playâ€� in the dispute.

The AP officials also raised objections to Karnatakaâ€™s Upper Tunga project, he said.

Referring to the 1892 river water agreement between the erstwhile princely state of Mysore and the Madras presidency, the CWC official said it would hold good under the law of succession.

He conceded that the upper riparian states did indeed enjoy an advantage over the states downstream. The upper states, therefore, had a duty to abide by the rule of law. Asked what the CWCâ€™s role would be in case Karnataka failed to follow its ruling, Das expressed confidence that the issue would be â€œresolved amicably.â€™â€™

5,CWC team's actions leaves minister livid,"HYDERABAD: Reacting sharply to the Central Water Commission member S K Dasâ€™s statements on Sunday, state irrigation minister Kadiam Srihari called him up and faulted him for wrongly stating that AP had neither demanded Paragodu be stopped nor filed a petition in the Supreme Court.

Srihari blamed the CWC member for â€œjeopardising two years of effortsâ€™â€™ made by the state government on the issue with the uncalled-for statements.

Das reportedly told the minister that he had been misunderstood and would issue a clarification on reaching Bangalore.

Addressing a press conference, Srihari said the state government had already filed a petition in the Supreme Court opposing Karnatakaâ€™s Paragodu project on river Chitravathi.

The case had not come up for hearing as the court was in vacation.

He distributed copies of the submissions made by AP officials to the CWC member recording the stateâ€™s objection to the Paragodu and Upper Tunga projects by Karnataka. Citing inter-state accord violations by Karnataka, the state government had demanded that these two projects be stopped.

Srihari clarified that the state government had filed its petition in the Supreme Court on May 14, 2003. The case would be admitted once the courtâ€™s vacation ends. He stated that a team of irrigation officials led by principal secretary J Harinarayana would accompany the CWC team to Karnataka on Monday.

The government had also requested the CWC to visit the Upper Tunga project site and accused the Karnataka government of making contradictory statements on the construction of the project, the minister said.

He said the state government also informed the CWC that Karnataka was building 11 other projects in the Pennar basin, all in violation of agreements.

The irrigation minister alleged that Karnataka had submitted false data on the Upper Tunga and Paragodu projects to the CWC. He said AP had requested the commission to review the permission given to Karnataka for the Upper Tunga project and in the meantime direct that the construction be stopped immediately.

There would be another allparty meet on June 19 or 20 and Chandrababu Naidu would lead an all-party delegation to the PM before the latter leaves on his China tour on June 22.

6,"Now, BJP gets into election yatra mode","HYDERABAD: After the Congress and the TDP, it is now the turn of the state BJP to undertake yatras in the state to galvanise the party into the election mode.

Keeping in view the good response to CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddyâ€™s Praja Prasthanam and also the ruling TDPâ€™s decision to undertake Jana Chaitanya yatras, the BJP thinks that it should also hit the road and tour all villages and conduct grama sabhas to meet the people and hear their grievances.

The party will finalise the schedule of the yatras soon. During the proposed tours in Telangana, the BJP plans to checkmate the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), which has emerged as a major political force in the region.

The yatras in this region would specifically lay stress on the separate Telangana state issue as it feels that alone had helped the regional party to project itself as a decisive political force in the state.

The party also wants to fine tune its strategy on separate Telangana state and identify the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies to be contested at its brainstorming session to be held at Visakhapatnam in the second week of July. All the state leaders, including BJP national president M Venkaiah Naidu would attend the meeting.

The BJP would abide by its Kakinada resolution on a separate state for the Telangana region. At the same time, however, it is committed to the NDA agenda, party official spokesperson Parakala Prabhakar told The Times Of India.

The party would also demand the government to declare September 17 â€” Telangana Liberation Day â€” as a public holiday in the state.

BJP in its office bearers meeting held recently discussed this matter. It had decided to hold public meetings in all important cities in the Telangana region and hoist national flags atop houses on September 17.

The party would conduct chintan bhaitaks at the state level and conduct massive â€˜Jana Sampark Abhiyanâ€™ to reach every village, mohalla and every house â€” Gaon Chalo-Ghar Ghar Chalo.

11,Hectic activity over council elections,"PATNA: The ensuing poll for 24 legislative council seats from the local bodies constituency has triggered off hectic political activity. Several politicians defeated in the Lok Sabha or assembly polls are seeking rehabilitation by way of being nominated by their party to contest the poll.

Political allies are holding talks for seat sharing, despite the fact that there is no provision for giving their official symbols to their candidates. Armed toughies with dubious track records are flexing their muscles for the polls. ""It is a frightening scenario. There may be cases of abduction and killing of candidates,"" remarked a top politician of the ruling party.

RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and newly-nominated state Congress president Ram Jatan Sinha held talks on Sunday on seat sharing as the process of filing of nominations starts on Monday. Sinha reportedly bargained for half of the 24 seats. The RJD chief is reported to have told him that he would rather settle the issue in Delhi with the Congress general secretary R K Dhawan. Sinha, according to Congress sources, is under pressure from old Congress leaders seeking entry to the council.

The NDA partners are also yet to finalise seat sharing. They are likely to hold another round of talks on the issue on Monday. ""We have suggested that each NDA partner contest eight seats. The voting takes place on preferential voting basis and we will be able to transfer votes,"" said senior JD-U leader Laxmi Sahu. Sahu said that the JD-U has received about 25 applications for contesting the forthcoming polls as the party candidate.

The RJD is yet to finalise its list of candidates. However, ministers in-charge of various districts are reported to have given the names of prospective candidates to the RJD chief. From Bhagalpur-Banka seat, ex-MP Chunchun Yadav is reported to be a strong candidate for RJDâ€™s nomination. Yadav had been denied the partyâ€™s ticket in the last Lok Sabha polls as the RJD gave the seat to its ally, the CPM.

RJD sources indicate that over two dozen ex-MPs and ex-MLAs are trying to obtain Lalooâ€™s approval to contest the polls. For Begusarai-Khagaria seat, urban development minister Sri Narayan Yadav is trying to get nomination for his son while ex-MLA Ranvir Yadav is trying for his kin.

""Members of the local bodies may not adhere to the dictates of political parties thrusting their candidates on them. Quite a few of them are expected to contest the polls on their own and cause major upsets,"" remarked a keen political observer of the state. a

12,Handicapped protest exam postponement,"LUCKNOW: Rajendra Kashyap, a physically handicapped postgraduate student from Kanpur, missed his train to Lucknow in the morning. He, somehow, managed to catch a maxi cab and stuffed at its rear with 20 others, he with a polio stricken left leg and arm reached the state capital by 9 AM to appear in the examination conducted by the Railway Recruitment Board only to find that it was postponed.

Same was the fate of over 2,000 physically challenged candidates, including the blind, who had come from across the state to appear in the examination which was postponed because railway authorities failed to deliver the question papers.

Irritated at the apathy of the railway authorities, the physically handicapped candidates blocked the Rana Pratap Marg in front of National Intermediate College for over two hours on Sunday afternoon.

Raising slogans against the railway officials, the candidates accused them of being â€˜cruelâ€™ to them. They also criticised them for ignoring their demand for conducting the examination district-wise.

""Had the examination been conducted in our home districts we would not have been forced to face such a situation,"" said PC Shukla, a candidate from Gorakhpur. He said that candidates from far-flung places, mostly belonging to lower middle class families, had to face many odds to reach the state capital for the examination. As the examination was to start at 10 AM, all the candidates reached the examination centre at National Intermediate College by 9.30 AM. They were asked to sit in the examination halls.

However, when over an hour passed and the question papers were not distributed, they became restless and started questioning invigilators about the reason behind the delay.

When the question papers were not given to them till 12.30 PM, the candidates left the centre and blocked the vehicular traffic in front of the college.

Senior police and district officials reached the spot to pacify the candidates but to no avail.

Uncertainty prevailed till 1 PM when finally a railway official VP Srivastava announced that the examination was postponed and fresh date would be announced later.

The railway officials, however, could not give any reason for the non-delivery of the question papers. They said that as the transportation of question papers was a confidential matter they could not reveal any information.

Interestingly, the railway officers, too, did not know the reason behind the inordinate delay in the arrival of the question papers as they kept on pacifying the candidates till 12.30 PM.

Finally, after 1 PM the examination was cancelled much to the harassment of the candidates.

13,"Cong, CPM protest power tariff hike","LUCKNOW: The power tariff hike has come in for all-round condemnation with the Congress having petitioned the governor on Sunday to ensure that the same was withdrawn. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), on the other hand, has directed its cadre to hold demonstrations at all district headquarters on June 20 to protest against the same.

UPCC president Jagdambika Pal and CLP leader Pramod Tewari have, in a letter to governor Vishnukant Shastri, stated that while, on the one hand, people were being subjected to heavy rostering on account of inadequate power, on the other hand, the government had decided to compound their misery by its decision to hike the tariff.

They stated that while very little power was being made available to farmers for irrigation purposes and they, along with domestic consumers, were subjected to a hike of 20 paisa per unit, industrialists were spared any additional hike. They added that a curb be put on the increased cases of power thefts.

Secretary of the state unit of CPI (M) Ram Sumer Yadav has directed the party cadre to hold demonstrations at all district headquarters. He said the decision to withdraw the 10 paisa rebate for early payment had put an additional burden on domestic consumers, adding that if the government did not retract its decision the party would launch a mass movement against the same.

14,CPM-RSP contest in civic polls,"KOLKATA: After the panchayat polls, Left Front partners CPM and RSP will confront each other once again in the forthcoming municipal polls, particularly in Balurghat in South Dinajpur.

Thirteen municipalities will go to polls on June 22.

Meanwhile, the Trinamul Congress has decided to boycott the polls in Chakdah municipality in protest against the poll rigging during the just concluded bypolls at the Nabadwip parliamentary constituency.

â€œWe could not forge unity among the Left Front constituents in Balurghat. We are trying our best to avoid a fight between the CPM and RSP before the polls,â€™â€™ Left Front chairman and CPM politburo member Biman Bose admitted on Sunday.

He also informed that the CPM state secretariat member and housing minister Gautam Deb had rushed to Balurghat to help the two parties arrive at an amicable settlement. The CPM and the RSP have been engaged in a mutual public mudslinging exercise at Balurghat following the bitterness over the panchayat polls.

Clashes among the partners are being reported from Haldibari, Dalkhola and other municipalities. Bose, however, denied this. â€œI have just visited Midnapore and there is unity on all the 24 seats being contested,â€™â€™ he said.

Opposition leader in the state assembly and Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee said that his party would boycott the Chakdah polls.

He complained that the CPM claimed to have garnered 66,000 votes in this segment of Nabadwip constituency this time. But the state higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty received only 16,000 votes during the assembly polls two years ago in this segment.

He also claimed both the Congress and BJP had agreed to boycott the polls in a joint meeting. But Congress MLA and Nadia district party president Sankar Singh denied that his party would boycott the polls. He rather criticised the Trinamul Congress for giving a â€˜walkoverâ€™ to the CPM.

Bose refused to react on the issue but questioned Banerjeeâ€™s right to speak for the Congress. â€œShe may take the brief for the BJP but how can she speak on behalf of Congress,â€™â€™ he asked.

15,DMK open to alliance for LS polls,"CHENNAI: In the midst of strains in ties with BJP in Tamil Nadu, the DMK, a key constituent of NDA, appears to be keeping its options open on the issue of alliance for next Lok Sabha polls.

In an wide-ranging interview, DMK President M Karunanidhi talked on a number of subjects including national political scene, general elections and the possibility of alliance with Congress.

""It was too premature to discuss the alliance issue. The issue will be taken up only after the polls are announced,"" he said when asked whether DMK would consider an alliance with Congress as its President Sonia Gandhi had stated that her party was not averse to coalition and in view of setbacks in DMK-BJP ties.

Asked whether his remarks mean that DMK was keeping its options open, Karunanidhi said ""do not read between the lines.""

The 80-year-old politician said general elections are ""like blowing winds and the political scene is cloud formation in the sky.""

""We have to see whether the velocity of wind will drive the cloud formation. However, elections forms basis for a change. We have to wait to see what sort of change is going to take place,"" Karunanidhi said.

Karunanidhi further said DMK would not sit quiet and play an effective role in effecting political change.

Asked what would be the role of DMK in effecting political change, he said ""we will not watch the fun. We will play an effective role in the change.""

However, DMK would evolve its political strategy fully keeping in mind the situation in Tamil Nadu as the state was expected to play its part in any change in the political situation, he said.

Asked whether the changing political situation in the country would have an impact on Tamil Nadu and what would be DMK''s stand in the changing situation, he said the party''s general council, the top policy-making body, would take stock of the situation before taking a final decision.

On the performance of NDA government in the past five years, he said a non-Congress government at the Centre for five years was itself a big achievement.

Making suo motto statement in Jammu and Kashmir legislative council following protest by the opposition members, Beig flayed the opposition for politicising the killing of former law minister Mustaq Ahmad Lone and said the government would place the facts before the house as and when the investigations are completed.

The director general of Jammu and Kashmri police on Sunday had disclosed the involvement of some police men in the killing of the former minister.

The National Conference MLAs protested for not taking the house into confidence before going to the press with the findings of the investigation into the killing of the former minister.

Regarding the press conference of DG police over the issue, Beig said the police chief wanted to put the speculations at rest as lot was being written in the press regarding this sensitive issue for the past couple of days. He said it is purely in the administrative capacity that DGP gave the information to the press and whenever a policy statement is to be made in the matter, it would be done by the government, he added.

Beig said it is for the first time during the turmoil that some headway has been made in the investigations into the killings, including that of an assassinated minister.

The state minister said, instead of hailing the police for taking the investigations to some conclusion, the Opposition is trying to draw political mileage out of the issue by staling the proceeding of the house, Beig added.

18,Sunil Dutt supports healing touch policy in J&K,"JALANDHAR: Supporting the ''healing touch'' policy of Jammu and Kashmir government, veteran film star and MP Sunil Dutt on Monday said such a move was instrumental in tackling militancy in Punjab in the 1980s.

""I have felt the impact of ''healing touch'' in 1987 when I was on a ''Sadbhavna Yatra'' in Punjab during the days of terrorism. Even militants welcomed me and I am sure that ''healing touch'' was instrumental in tackling militancy in the state.

""In Jammu and Kashmir too, it can be effective in bringing back normalcy,"" Dutt said.

Hailing Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for offering a ''hand of friendship'' to Pakistan, he said, ""sincere efforts with open heart and mind from both sides should be made to restore peace in the sub-continent.""

Dutt was talking to reporters after visiting the gurudwara in Talhan village, where caste clashes had broken out recently on the issue of management of the shrine.

Asked about the growing influence of the underworld on the film industry and the incident involving Shilpa Shetty''s father, Dutt said, ""which area is not influenced by the underworld ... it is everywhere, but the media has unnecessarily highlighted the issue (of Shetty''s father).

Asked about the status of the proposal, Maken said ""it is under active consideration.""

Tata officials from Mumbai confirmed the move but did not give details.

In a letter to Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit, Tata Power had recently expressed desire to set up a plant at Bawana either on its own or in a joint venture with the Delhi Government, Maken said.

Asked if other private parties had also evinced interest in setting up generation units in power-starved Delhi, Maken said ""we have also talked to BSES asking them to set up generation facility.

""Reliance also has huge reserves of gas and Delhi requires maximum peaking load, it suits both,"" he said adding Reliance also appeared to be keen on this.
