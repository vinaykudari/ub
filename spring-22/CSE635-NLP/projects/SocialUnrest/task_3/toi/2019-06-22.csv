0,Rehab project for riot widows under way,"AHMEDABAD: Nearly four months after the riots, life continues to be at a standstill for some, especially the women who have been widowed during the disturbances. According to provisional figures provided by Self Employed Women''s Association (SEWA), the riots have widowed over 238 women.

""For months now, they have been unable to speak. They are still in a state of shock and stare blankly in front of them"", says Reema Nanavati, general secretary of SEWA.

In order to support these women, SEWA in collaboration with the department of women and child welfare, has undertaken a project called ''Shanta'', which proposes to provide self-employment to these women; reconstruct their houses or provide them with alternative residences; provide them trauma-counselling and arrange for their insurance cover.

A team of 40 volunteers has been trained by SEWA to undertake this project. So far, it has conducted an intensive survey, going from house to house, to assess the individual needs of these women, in six of the affected districts of Gujarat.

Training has already begun for activities such as garment-stitching; vegetable vending and marketing; agro-forestry; kite-making; animal husbandry; stationery and file-making. Some are also trained to become hospital attendants.

The department has tied up with over 20 NGOs across the state and taken up 37 programmes to provide livelihood, out of which 25 are already underway, said Rita Tevatia, secretary of the department. ""I haven''t put a limit on the budget. We invite proposals from various NGOs and funds are earmarked according to the merit of the proposal"". The Gujarat Women''s Economic Development Corporation Ltd is the monitoring agency for these projects.

The Ahmedabad Muslim Women''s Association (AMWA), has been involved in a couple of these projects. ""In Sankalitnagar camp, for instance, we trained 60 women in vegetable vending and marketing. At the end of the training, these women were given hand carts and a working capital of Rs 1000 at a function. The project cost came to about two lakh funded by the government"", she said.

Another project where 120 women were trained in garment-stitching has come to an end.

AMWA, also has started a 24-hour telephone helpline service, as part of the government''s ''Swadhar'' scheme. This helpline would advise and guide women facing atrocities such as ones related to dowry, divorce, mental trauma, physical assault, extra marital relations, alcohol and drug abuse, as well as economic crises.

3,Two ISI agents arrested in Bijnore,"MEERUT: Two ISI agents, allegedly responsible for transporting secret files of classified defence documents and passing on other vital information about security to top ISI officers in Pakistan, were arrested in Bijnore district on Friday.

On May 23, two Pakistan-trained ISI agents were arrested in Bulandshahr district.

According to Army intelligence sources, the duo, identified as Ahmad Hussain alias Babu and Wasif Khan, were arrested in the Zafalganj locality of Najibabad town, 30 km from Bijnore.

The arrests were made following a joint raid conducted by the police and Military Intelligence officers.

Many secret Army documents pertaining to Indian troop movement from their respective cantonments to the international border, maps of these cantonments and states, apart from detailed description and accounts of armament depots and ordnance factories, were also recovered from them.

Besides, a book containing the telephone numbers of senior ISI officers and a paper containing methods of manufacturing crude bombs were also seized.

The interrogation of these persons revealed that both originally belonged to the Najibabad area, but had been frequently visiting Islamabad and Lahore for the last four years and had been trained by an ISI officer in Pakistan.

One of the arrested ISI agents, Ahmad Hussain, confessed during questioning that being a trained driver by profession, ISI officers had bought him a truck along with an all-India permit. The objective of buying the truck was to facilitate the transportation of secret defence documents from different cantonments.

According to the sources, the duo had been actively involved in the business for the last four years and were paid for it handsomely. Their interrogation also revealed that they had been frequently receiving calls from top ISI officers who used to assign tasks to them.

4,Refund of income tax by July 15,"NEW DELHI: The government has asked the income-tax department to make all pending tax refunds to tax-payers by July 15 and to expedite the computerisation drive to streamline tax administration and simplify procedures, chairman of direct board of direct taxes P K Sarma said here on Friday.

Sarma said the government was confident that tax collections would be buoyant this year. Although there have been huge refunds in the first two months, it is unlikely to cloud collections for the year.

Despite the hefty refunds, Sarma said, â€˜â€˜We have issued instructions to all commissionerates to complete tax refunds by July 15.â€™â€™ The move is part of CBDTâ€™s efforts to facilitate tax-payers and ensure higher tax compliance.

Sarma said that the tax department is expediting the computerisation drive to ensure correct assessment of the tax and its refund.

â€˜â€˜I have reason to be upbeat about the tax collections. The collections for income-tax and corporation tax have been good,â€™â€™ he told reporters after addressing a seminar here.

7,BJP assails Rabri govt for all-round failure,"PATNA: BJP on Saturday alleged that Rabri Devi Ministry was an abject failure on all fronts in Bihar and pledged that the party was committed to end the ''jungle raj'' by dislodging the RJD dispensation.

""There is no law and order worth its name in Bihar and the state is gripped by anarchy and chaos,"" BJP national general secretary and in-charge of Bihar affairs Maya Singh told newspersons here.

Expressing her party''s resolve to dislodge the present regime, Singh said: ""Our workers are united from the district to state-level to achieve the objective.""

Singh, who dwelt on the ""miserable financial condition of Bihar"", said against the national GDP of 6.5 per cent, the state had an abysmal showing of only one per cnt.

The power situation in the state was ''extremely grim'' and the government owed a whopping Rs 335 crore as arrears to the National Thermal Power Corporation, she said.

Same was the condition of Bihar State Rajya Transport Corporation where the employees had not been paid salaries for several months, she alleged.

To a question, the BJP leader said her party would strive for strengthening the National Democratic Alliance in Bihar to oust the present dispensation.

9,Why govt zigs when it should zag?,"BANGALORE: Karnataka is in the news these days for all the wrong reasons. It draws flak for keeping under custody 50-odd Congressmen from Maharashtra lest they are poached by the BJP-Shiv Sena combine.

Two senior ministers engage in a verbal dispute over the formation of special courts. The Kannada Development Authority (KDA) and the government issue contradictory statements. And finally, the badly-needed cabinet revamp fails to take off.

Let us start with the latest: the revamp news. That the ministry needs an overhaul is a fact. Several non-performers deserve to be shown the door, young and bright ones need to be inducted and a few drafted for party work.

The revamp has been in the air for some time now. But Chief Minister Krishna''s sudden visit to the Governor and call for a meeting of the council of ministers set off a flurry of activity.

Ministers kept calling each other. Names started making the rounds. Some know-alls in the media, egged on by minister friends, brandished lists of new ministers and their portfolios. The excitement ended with a whimper, with Krishna saying, `No such move, for now''.

The hush hush, however, continues. From where did Krishna get three telephone calls during the meeting? Was he asked to postpone the revamp, pending a few more changes? If so, is June 26 the D-Day?

Krishna has called another meeting of the council of ministers that day. Will he ask the ministry to quit to effect the changes? Or, did Krishna''s cohorts spread the rumours to keep the ministers on tenterhooks, particularly when the CM is set to go on a foreign trip? Will the revamp happen after his return? With such questions in circulation, imagine the seriousness with which work is being done.

A few days before this drama, a government order to promote Kannada in schools stirred a hornet''s nest. The order made it mandatory for schools opened after 1994 to implement Kannada medium from Class I to V from this academic year. Guess who raised the objection? The KDA. It accused the government of ignoring its recommendations.

The KDA had looked at Class III as a point of reference -- English as a subject for non-English medium schools and Kannada as a subject for non-Kannada schools. The government hit back by saying that the KDA had no right to question the GO.

The standoff proved to be a blessing in disguise for schools and parents, who were caught unawares by the GO. They have now sought deferment of the order. Can''t the government and KDA work hand in hand to tackle such a ticklish issue? Can''t they also take the school managements and parents into confidence?

Amidst this, two senior ministers locked horns over the need to set up special courts to try detainees, like underworld don Muthappa Rai, under the KCOCA (Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act), a variant of POTA.

While Home Minister Mallikarjuna Kharge said that such courts were necessary, Law Minister Chandre Gowda felt otherwise. Gowda alleged Kharge was confused. Kharge quoted relevant sections of the Act to buttress his argument. The dissent happened in full media glare causing acute embarrassment to the government.

Shouldn''t the two ministers have discussed this between themselves? Shouldn''t the CM have called the two and sorted out the differences? The detainees must indeed have had a hearty laugh.

Just before this drama, hordes of Maharashtra legislators descended on Bangalore to escape the BJP-Shiv Sena net. The city has been a safe haven for politicians of all hues in the hour of crisis. It happened when the Congress plotted to overthrow the NTR government in Andhra Pradesh a few years ago. His MLAs were kept in safe custody here.

This time the Congress felt such a need. When the Deshmukh government had to face a trial of strength, he turned to Bangalore to prevent his MLAs from straying. The Congress unit in Karnataka not only did keep them at a health resort for several days but also extended all hospitality.

Two high-profile ministers were drafted for the purpose. They kept a strict vigil on the MLAs day and night and looked after their comforts. But who foots the bill? The Krishna government or the Congress (Karnataka or Maharashtra unit)? The government says the MLAs will pay. Will they? Only the health resort owner, actor-producer Sanjay Khan, will know.

The government will do well to devote precious time and energy on improving infrastructure, tackling power and drinking water scarcity, and looking into other day-to-day problems.

10,"End political pro-minority circus, says Gowda","BANGALORE: Former prime minister H D Deve Gowda on Saturday said the fielding of scientist A P J Abdul Kalam by the NDA for the Presidential post smacked of ""hypocrisy of the highest order and reflects their opportunism.""

""People are not naive to believe that the BJP or the NDA is fielding Kalam out of love for the minorities. If the two think they can erase their crime committed against the minorities in Gujarat, it will be a big joke,"" Gowda said in a statement here.

Gowda is the second politician after senior Congress MP C K Jaffer Sharief who has criticised the NDA on the candidate''s selection. Both have clarified that the attack is not against Kalam, but on his being used by the NDA purportedly to placate the minorities.

""I have no objections to Kalam as Presidential candidate, but I question the NDA''s commitment to the minorities. Can Prime Minister A B Vajpayee provide succour and wipe the tears of 1.5 lakh families huddled in relief camps after the terror unleased by communal elements, sponsored and supported by his own Parivar?"" he asked.

Gowda said the Congress party too had elevated two persons from the minority community to the high post. ""But the suffering of the community remains unchanged for over five decades. They are caught in the crossfire between vote bank politics of some parties and the anti-minority parties, forcing them to take shelter under obscurantism,"" he contended.

Gowda said: ""The immediate need for all political parties is to bring about Constitutional changes for the uplift of minorities instead of indulging in the so called pro-minority circuses and token appointments.""

State Janata Dal(U) president C. Byre Gowda said Deve Gowda''s support to the Left parties sponsored presidential candidate Lakshmi Sahgal will not affect the merger prospects of the Janata Parivar in Karnataka. ""The state JD-U legislators would support Kalam. As regards the four JD-S legislators, it is up to them to take a decision,"" he added.
