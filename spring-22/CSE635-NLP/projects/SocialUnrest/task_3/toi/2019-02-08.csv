0,Admn may spoil Big B's party,"lucknow: twenty-four hours before the mega star amitabh bachchan and his wife jaya participate in a blood donation camp in the city, the lucknow nagar nigam served a notice on the organisers of the function and questioned holding of the felicitation programme on technical grounds. in a one-page `notice' hand-delivered to the president of the central bar association and signed by the chief architect of the lnn, gs goel, has written to the central bar association that in the absence of a written permission from the district administration they found holding of the function untenable. the lnn authorities also faxed a note to the adm (city) seeking to know how the preparations for the function were being allowed in the absence of the mandatory permission from the administration. when contacted, district magistrate jeevesh nandan told times news network that there was an application for permission to hold the programme but it had been forwarded to the police authorities for scrutiny. ""i cannot say anything for sure just now, permission for the function would depend on the clearance from the police,"" nandan added. when asked whether this could also mean a `no' to the much-hyped event, the dm said he did not rule out anything since the police would have the final say. ""we will take a decision as and when we hear from the police officials,"" he said. on january 25, the lnn had given its nod for the same event with laxman mela ground as venue. a payment of rs 55,000, which included land fees of rs 5000 per day for 3 days (february 7-9) and a security deposit of rs 20,000, was also made. in a late night development on thursday, the lnn slapped another notice on the organisers asking them to pay on commercial rates of rs 15,000 for february 9 as the event was not merely for a social cause and hence did not merit an exemption. the dilly-dallying attitude of the authorities has set the political temperature in the state capital on the boil. the samajwadi party alleged that the bjp was resorting to cheap tactics in the wake of the huge popularity of the sp and was rattled by the crowds swarming the big b's events in which he is sharing the dais with mulayam singh yadav and amar singh. though the state sp leaders remained silent on the fate of the rally for fear of being politically identified with the big b, sp general secretary and friend of the film star, amar singh said that ""nothing better was expected of a party that has been sucking the blood of the hapless masses."" ""i am shocked to note that the bjp government and its officials are seeing politics in a very noble cause,"" singh added. organiser of the event and president of central bar association raj kumar yadav said the authorities were trying to harass them at the behest of urban development minister lalji tandon, who he claimed, was misusing his authority to take vengenance on the lawyers since they had treated tandon shoddily when he went to the court a few days back to seek votes.

3,Home minister justifies Nair’s transfer order,"hyderabad:in a strong rebuttal to former ips officer v p b nair's comments against the police establishment in the state, home minister t devender goud on thursday categorically said that he stands by his recommendation to chief minister n chandrababu naidu to transfer nair from the post of principal secretary of the home department. despite putting in years of experience, nair never behaved as a senior police officer. when i asked for his suggestions on some issues, he made suggestions which even the junior-most staff in the department would not make. therefore, i recommended to the chief minister to transfer him from the post and i stand by my recommendation, the home minister told reporters at a press conference. to illustrate his claim, goud circulated copies of suggestions made by nair when he was asked to convey his views on the improvements that needed to be carried out to refurbish the department's image and functioning. the home minister, however, refused to answer queries about nair's remarks on dgp hj dora on the ground that he did not want to go into the issues of personal grudges between two officials.

4,Nawab scion courts farmers,"bagpat: if you ask someone in the bazaar here about choudhury charan singh's house, the man greets you, reverentially recalls the great jat who became the prime minister and then directs you to the nawab's palace. the sprawling haveli, however, has nothing to do with charan singh. it is the residence and now the campaign office of lok dal candidate kokab hamid. because of his close association with lok dal chief ajit singh, charan singh's son, popular imagination has allowed a little confusion to prevail. in fact, one learns that the late charan singh, who had represented bagpat in parliament since 1977, did not hail from the place. hamid, on his part, has not been a consistent follower of charan singh's family nor a votary of kisan rights. he, like the scion of many other erstwhile princely families, has tried his political luck in different camps. the inner quarters of the decaying palace are, in fact, full of reminders of another era when the gandhi-nehrus were on the ascendant in north indian politics. pictures of indira gandhi and rajiv with members of the nawab family are proudly displayed. the one-time minister in n d tiwari's cabinet enjoys popularity and a clean image. ajit singh has been in the field campaigning for him as is the alliance partner the bjp.

5,Birds help farmer manage pests,"hyderabad: a two-day national symposium on 'avian biodiversity-issues and conservation strategies' began here on thursday with a call to protect birds which serve as effective pest control agents. addressing the inaugural session of the meet, dr k janakiram, former director of research and pg dean of the gujarat agricultural university, said birds controlled as much as 80 per cent of the pests in various crops. it is the rest of the 20 per cent of pests that all plant protection measures are aimed at. imagine the impact of not having birds on pest control measures alone, he said. birds are seen as predators on crops because the creatures are looked at from the human point of view.the practice of deciding upon what the issues with relation to birds should be should end, he said. explaining the role of birds from 'seed-to-seed' cycle, janakiraman said birds crops are not natural food for birds but they get drawn to fields as the crops form a ready and easy source of food. instead of trying to fight the birds and scare them away, it is easier and beneficial to plant some fruit trees such as fig trees which will draw the birds away from the crops, he said. dr a padma raju, director of research, acharya n g ranga agricultural university, which is hosting the symposium, said though birds were once part of the agricultural eco system, they were now being consciously included in the integrated pest management plans. earlier, dr o p dubey, assistant director general (plant protection), indian council for agricultural research inaugurated the meet. the two-day event is being conducted by the society for applied ornithology.

""but they had not conducted the need assessment of these villagers. later on, they saw that the toilets were stuffed with fodder. they then realised that the villagers needed help in building godowns, instead of toilets,"" nyati said. meattle said, ""it's not one man's job to implement corporate sustainability. one has to ensure the participation of the stake-holders as well."" experts from canada, tom conway and darin rovere, said the nehru place greens initiative showed that the paharpur business centre was well-positioned to attain sustainability.

13,Temple can wait only if there's war: VHP to govt,"mumbai: the vishwa hindu parishad said it would reconsider its march 12 deadline to begin constructing the temple in ayodhya only if there is a war with pakistan. ""if our government is ready to finish pakistan, we are ready to wait. however, our two demands are, take over pakistan and allow the temple construction. if one is not happening, the other will. therefore, we have given time to the government till march 12,"" vhp general secretary pravin togadia said at a press conference in mumbai. denying that the temple construction programme was aimed at influencing the uttar pradesh assembly elections in favour of the bjp, togadia said the vhp's plan will become operational on february 24 when the elections in the state conclude. he advised the centre to coordinate with jews and other communities that have been fighting islamic terrorism. ""demolition of the ram temple by babar 450 years ago and destruction of the world trade centre on september 11 last year are two faces of islamic terrorism,"" he claimed. meanwhile, bjp general secretary sunil shastri told a press conference that the bjp's position that it would act as a facilitator for the temple construction was constant. he said that the party wanted an amicable solution to the dispute. alternatively, a court order would have to be awaited. if the verdict was in favour of the temple, the bjp would be glad to assist in the construction, he said. but togadia ruled out the possibility of any amicable solution on the contentious issue and declared that his activists were prepared to make the supreme sacrifice this time. he said the activists would be called ram sevaks as against the earlier kar sevaks. he said the assignment on december 6, 1992 had been to bring down the babri masjid.

""all of them gave us a patient hearing. none of these leaders told us to construct a mosque in ayodhya,"" he said.

17,Spirit of politics in holy city,"varanasi: since the days of the house tax protest of 1810, when benaras rose as one against the predations of the colonial state, the city of shiva has taken politics at least as seriously as spirituality. on the ghats of ganga, the holy men of kashi talk about the theory of karma with as much detachment as they discuss the caste arithmetic of the coming assembly polls with passion. on a chilly february evening on assi ghat, narsing shukla, among the most senior of benaras' pandas, warms slowly to the subject of politics but once in flight he is full of anguish — at the state of vartman rajniti — and prognostications — about the outcome of the polls. none of the politicians today is truly interested in upholding dharma, he says. they are merely interested in exploiting people's faith for political gain. shukla feels particularly strongly about what he calls bjp's ""duplicity"" on the ayodhya issue - a sentiment that is widely echoed among the religious orders of varanasi. whether it is the deposed mahant of the kashi viswanath temple adjoining gyanvapi mosque, kulpati tiwari, or it is the head priest of the equally famous sankat mochan temple, virbhadra mishra. in his house at tulsi ghat, mishra is even more caustic about another issue which is as close to his heart as ""the name of ram"": the bjp government's lack of action on the second phase of the action plan to clean up ""mother ganga"". ""given the significance of ganga in the hindu heart, you would think that this is an issue which will earn them as much political mileage as the ram temple issue - and without attracting the adverse international opinion that is associated with the latter. but they are completely indifferent."" ganga, according to mishra, is the greatest symbol of india's cultural identity ""because of the ritual and religious significance of water in our heritage"". in the current climate of ""aggressive globalisation"", a failure to save the ganga, says mishra, will mean a complete ""homogenization of hindustan"". ""from table manners to taste, we will soon become slaves to the (western) consumerist culture of colas, fast food and bottled water"". despite the civilizational angst and the growing disillusionment with bjp politics, however, the sadhus and mahants of benaras, one suspects, have too much in common with the parivar's project of cultural nationalism to break away from it quite so easily. in varanasi (south) assembly constituency — where they exercise considerable influence — the presence of a well-respected brahmin candidate from the congress has generated a muted buzz, but on the whole the legacy of the ramjanambhoomi movement is alive and well, temple or no. the party has tried to enlist the services of influential holy men, but apart from an odd sampoornand swamy with little success. as one office bearer of the city congress and follower of shuklaji put it: ""the situation might have been different if the congress had brought in priyankaji for campaigning. but as of now, the congress has no leadership in the state and the savarna (caste hindus) have no vikalp (choice) but to go the bjp."" related link

25,Water politics takes centre stage,"rajkot: water has once again taken centre stage in the election for the rajkot-2 assembly election. water resources minister narottam patel''s announcement has been termed as a breach of model code of conduct and ''election-oriented''. patel''s statement that rajkot would be supplied water for 22 days in a month by april seems to be a pipedream meant to woo voters. leader of the opposition naresh raval told this correspondent that they would bring this to the state election commission''s notice. ""like the hoardings this too was a clear-cut case of breach of model code of conduct as it directly affected the voters of rajkot"". mayor ashok dangar told this correspondent that for the past three years, the citizens of rajkot were never supplied water for 22 days. they got water on alternate days, that too, for 20 or 25 minutes. dangar said while inaugurating the malia canal chief minister had claimed that the people would get narmada water by april but that seems a pipedream. ""even during the past one week the flow from the mahi and narmada pipeline was erratic and the civic body had to draw water from the bhadar dam and wankaner bore"", he said. the city depended on the wankaner bore for the past three years, said water committee chairman bharat makwana. ""the civic body needs three crore gallons of water a day but it was getting 1.85 lakh gallons of water of which nearly 1.15 lakh gallons was being lifted from the wankaner bore"". it was impossible to supply water 22 days in a month as the pipeline was yet to be laid. the voters, too, were sceptical. ""every time we get such an assurance and every time the deadline passes without the water flowing into our taps"", said a voter rashmi mehta, and added it is amply sure that the voter could not fall prey to such announcement.

30,Schoolgirl draws more attention than any other Cong rally speaker,"vadodara: she drew more attention than any other heavyweight leader giving an election speech for the congress candidate at a public meeting here. she held the audience captive with her flawless hindi, unlike some others during whose speech the mammoth gathering became restless. no wonder, she wants to be prime minister one day. this about nine-year-old seemed to have rehearsed her role in the congress campaign well. ""mujhe advaniji milte nahin hain, aap se mile to kehna janaki gadhvi se mile (advaniji does not meet me, if he meets you ask him to see me),"" she said while throwing a challenge to the union home minister. her argument being that he has done little for the state despite being elected from here. during the course of her speech she spared no leader, from keshubhai patel to narendra modi, george fernandes to the prime minister. a series of corruption charges flowed, along with hindi poems and urdu couplets. then came the woes of the state during the earthquake, and even issues like electricity supply to farmers were not spared. and all the while, the audience remained mesmerised. the congress seems to have caught this starlet pretty young. she has been campaigning for the party since 1998, when she had addressed a rally in mehsana. ""i was invited to address party rallies, and since then i have spoken at several of them. this includes a rally in lucknow during the last lok sabha polls,"" she says. this standard five student of st xavier''s school in gandhinagar has travelled extensively in the state and outside to address public meetings. ""i am confident enough to speak against any one and in front of any number of people,"" she says. this budding politician is already interested in what several leaders of her party do. while other children of her age watch cartoon network, she enjoys watching parliament proceedings. ""i like seeing what the leaders do there and how they speak. it also helps me in preparing my speeches,"" she points out. preparing the text of her speech is another task that she enjoys doing with the help of her mother and others. despite her inclination towards politics, studies are close to her heart. ""i want to study political science and then become an ias officer. after achieving these goals, i would like to become prime minister some day,"" she says. for now, it is quick switching of gears between books and rallies. with the congress striving to make an impact in the by-elections, this starlet could well prove to be a vital arrow in its quiver of campaigners.

32,Cotton farmers on the brink of ruin: Sanat Mehta,"ahmedabad: former mp and nationalist congress party (ncp) leader sanat mehta has stated that cotton growers of india and gujarat in particular are pushed to the brink of ruin because the central government has not increased the support price of shankar variety over last year''s support price. this year, the first flowering failed and cotton growers suffered their second blow. now when neighbouring maharashtra government has purchased more than 20 lakh bales at rs 2,230 per quintal as against the support price of rs 1,840, gujarat has remained a silent spectator to the sufferings of cotton growers of the state. the government of india raised the import duty on cotton from five to 10 per cent but it had no impact on markets or imports, mehta said in a statement. the former state finance minister said every year cotton growers have to spend large sum on insecticides to save cotton crop from deadly ball worm pest. when gujarat farmers planted bt. cotton in over 10,000 ha to get higher productivity, quality and save the high cost of insecticides, the government of india asked gujarat to destroy the crop, turning a blind eye on the genuine problem. now it is learnt that farmers are purchasing bt. cotton from market to use its cotton seed as seed in the forthcoming season. scientifically, mehta said, it cannot be grown in this manner. as against this, china started encouraging growing of genetic cotton in 1996 and today it is being grown in seven lakh ha, as it has proved a great boon to small and marginal farmers. it has saved chinese farmers from high cost of insecticides and simultaneously augmented their income. now this cotton has reached kathmandu market. china encouraged this cotton in spite of warning that this cotton leads to environment damage after some years. mehta further stated that when china has entered the world market in a big way, he failed to understand the attitude of the committee appointed by the agriculture ministry which has failed to come to conclusion even after field trials of full five years. he said china has emerged as a big competitor of india in the world economy while the us is exporting its high cost cotton in the world market by paying 40 per cent subsidy per quintal to its farmers. mehta said it is high time that government of india comes to a conclusion on the issue before it becomes too late.

""the age is in the mind,"" he says as he waits for his car to be scrutinised. ""i got my driving licence way back in 1948 from the baroda state. the licence i use now was issued in 1949. i have participated in rallies like the baroda rayon rally and will be driving from saturday with my navigator harish muley. muley doesn''t have a driving licence and so, no one can raise a finger at me and say he drove the car because i am 69,"" says dastur with a smile. he will be driving a matiz car during the rally. ""the rally is an effort at instilling the spirit of adventure among the youth. and, we wanted the rally to pass through a unique terrain so that it gets onto the international car rally map like the dakkar rally,"" adds karnik.
