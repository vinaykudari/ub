2,SEC rules out any delay in panchayat polls,"KOLKATA: After holding a two-hour meeting with district magistrates on Tuesday, state election commissioner Ajoy Sinha ruled out postponing the panchayat elections as demanded by the Opposition.

Though the final decision would be taken on Wednesday, Sinha said reports received from 17 DMs indicated that the law-and-order situation was favourable for holding free and fair polls.

The Trinamul, Congress and BJP described the meeting as an eyewash and a part of the stateâ€™s plan to brush all incidents of intimidation by CPM activists under the carpet.

The entire Opposition had been alleging ever since the election process began that their candidates had been forcibly prevented from filing nominations.

They had demanded that the polls be postponed and the last date of filing nominations be extended.

In view of the charges, the SEC had directed the DMs on Monday to send reports on the law-and-order situation in their respective districts and had sought their opinion on whether the elections should be postponed.

â€œSo far I have received written reports from 11 DMs. All of them have said that there was no law-andorder problem in their districts,â€� Sinha said. â€œThe commission is satisfied with the situation and feels that it is conducive to holding of free and fair polls,â€� he added.

State chief secretary Sourin Roy met the district magistrates at the Writersâ€™ Buildings earlier in the day to take stock of the situation. The DMs reportedly told him that there was no major law-and-order problem that warranted postponement of the polls.

The state government has already geared up security arrangements for the sixth panchayat polls in West Bengal to be held on May 11 in which 3,38,11,734 people will cast their votes. The 44,131 booths have been divided into four categories according to sensitivity.

Booths in areas where PW, Kamtapur Liberation Organisation or Kamtapur Peopleâ€™s Party are active have been marked A1. In category A will be the booths in areas where political clashes have occurred. The less sensitive booths will be in categories B or C.

3,Rural power body not to shelve projects during polls,"KOLKATA: West Bengal Rural Energy Development Corporation, a state-run body, will continue its projects for rural electrification during the panchayat polls despite objections from the state election commission on the ground that it violates poll norms and may affect voters.

WEBREDA chairman Sujan Chakraborty, a CPM leader, claimed at the Writersâ€™ on Tuesday that work would not violate election commission guidelines. â€œWe have not taken up any new projects but are implementing the ongoing ones. The law does not prevent this,â€� said Chakraborty.

The state EC office was yet to reply to the WEBREDAâ€™s argument, he added.

Opposition parties have complained that the governmentâ€™s â€œsudden zealâ€� for rural electrification which was neglected for years together, was aimed at influencing panchayat voters in favour of the ruling Left Front.

Chakraborty and WEBREDA MD Asoke Santra insisted that the corporation had been working in the rural areas for the past three years.

With the government desperate to offload the subsidy burden on the lossmaking WBSEB and increase revenue earnings, the WEBREDA would take the entire responsibility of rural power supply including maintenance and revenue collection.

â€œFor this purpose, the role of the panchayats would be important,â€� said Chakraborty

4,TMBU students protest VC's move,"BHAGALPUR: Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) vice-chancellor Ramashray Yadav might have won accolades for his educational reforms on the campus, but the voice of dissidence seems to be looming large now, particularly among the students for his alleged dictating and kowtow-loving approach.

The students of post-graduate department of statistics in TMBU, on Tuesday, boycotted their examinations, agitating against the suspension of their head of the department, Akshay Kumar Mishra. During the course of boycotting the papers, the students, numbering 21, said that the boys received minor injuries, while the girls received some expletives from the invigilators, including Jyotindra Chowdhary, the dean of studentsâ€™ welfare in TMBU.

When the students reached the university police station to lodge an FIR in this connection, the officials present there reportedly refused to lodge it. Later, the agitating students rushed to Kotwali police station. Later, the Bhagalpur district magistrate and the SSP took over the matter and assured the students of a tangible solution in this case.

Incidentally, the statistics department of TMBU is the only department in eastern India, where the subject has been compounded with computer applications.

Mishra, who had been suspended on the charges of irregularities in the question paper, is the only visiting professor, who delivers regular lectures at several IIMs in India. This is the reason why many students from the universities of West Bengal and Orrisa come here for further studies in statistics.

Students in a press release, said, ""The VC''s decision would not only spoil our careers, but also defame our department. We do not understand why the VC does not rely on students"". Lopamudra, a student from Kolkata said all the students are not corrupt. Corroborating Lopamudra''s views, another student of the department says, ""We would like to lose our session rather than attend the lectures of a laboratory assistant (Bhaskar Pathak) and following the dictates of the present DSW (Jyotindra Chowdhary) who is himself controversial"".

Meanwhile, the suspended post-graduate head of statistics department, Akshay Kumar Mishra, said, ""Only time will tell whether I made any mistake or not"".

Meanwhile, the TMBU VC said: â€œDuring the course of my investigation, I found that Akshay Kumar Mishra is one of the best teachers and, therefore, his suspension is being revoked.â€�

6,Women panels push for Bill on domestic violence,"NEW DELHI: Womenâ€™s groups are stepping up pressure on the government for the early passage of the pending Domestic Violence Bill.

Several womenâ€™s groups, including Lawyersâ€™ Collective, Action India, Womenâ€™s Rights Initiative, North Eastern Network and Mahila Atyacahar Virodhi Jan Andolan, said it was important to enact the law at the earliest as their experience shows that the victims of domestic violence were often done to death before any legal effort can be made.

â€˜â€˜A law that ensures an early and timely intervention to help women get out of such violent relationships is essential,â€™â€™ said well-known legal expert Indira Jaising. Supporting the need for the immediate enactment of the law, Shanti, a representative of the Positive Womenâ€™s Network, Chennai, stated that women living with HIV/AIDS find that once their status gets known, they confront all forms of domestic violence.

12,"J&K polls a turning point, says Advani","NEW DELHI: Terming free, fair and transparent Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir as a ""turning point"", Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Wednesday said that this had now restored the Centre''s credibility in the sensitive state despite ""some officials"" suggesting before the elections that the government should ""direct"" its outcome in a ""certain manner"".

Asserting that the Centre rejected such suggestions to prove its commitment to democracy, he said some officials, whom he did not name, had suggested that Jammu and Kashmir was a very sensitive state and, therefore, the Centre should be concerned about what was happening there.

Observing that he could take the Rajya Sabha into confidence now as polls in the state had taken place, Advani said that these officials wanted that election results should be directed in a certain manner which the government was totally opposed to.

Replying to a debate on the working of the home ministry in the Upper House, he said certain Central decisions in the past had contributed to alienation of people of the state and New Delhi was not trusted.

Stating the Centre''s credibility had gone up in the eyes of the people of Jammu and Kashmir judging especially from the response Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee got during his visit to Srinagar last week, Advani said that the NDA government was committed to democracy and he was ""very happy"" that free, fair and transparent polls had taken place there.

He said that the Mufti Sayeed government had made a ""quite good beginning"".

""Today free and fair elections in the state have not only raised India''s credibility but people of Jammu and Kashmir have also started trusting New Delhi. Here is a government which does what it says,"" Advani said, adding a ""change in climate"" had taken place in Jammu and Kashmir.

Advani said that the Congress, which was sharing power with the Sayeed government, had a major role to play in the state.

Recalling developments during run-up to the Assembly polls, Advani said that the government rejected the demand that foreign observers should monitor the polls or that it should be held under UN supervision.

He said that besides foreign diplomats stationed here, foreign and Indian media had covered the elections. ""Our own press is far more vigilant and if any hanky panky had taken place, our own press would not have spared us,"" he added.

He rejected the Opposition charge that government did not have a Kashmir policy saying it had maintained consistency on whatever it had stated right from the beginning.

13,Woman beaten up for protesting eve-teasing,"LUDHIANA: In a bizarre incident, two men pinned down a woman, Lal Kumari, outside her house and beat her up brutally on Wednesday morning. She was subjected to this violence because she dared to protest against them for passing lewd and offensive comments at her daughters, Rani and Manju.

The womanâ€™s husband and her son were also beaten up on the same day by the duo, leaving her husband, Dharam Nath Sharma, a PSEB employee, badly injured. Madhu, the woman living nextdoor, said that when she went to help Lal Kumari, she was also beaten up by the two men.

One of the girls, Rani, said that the two men, Satpal and Surinder, lived close to their house. She and her sister Manju were sitting on their terrace on Monday morning, when these men passed obscene remarks and made disgraceful gestures at them. When their mother came to know of this, she went to the menâ€™s house to complain to their father, Phagan Singh.

But she never expected a rude reply from him, who said, â€˜â€˜Mere ghoda ta eh hee dodan gey, tusee apniya ghodiya andhar bandh lo (my son will behave in the same fashion, you lock your daughters inside your house)â€™â€™.

The worried mother then started sending her son, Sarwan Kumar, along with her daughters to school. On noticing this new development, the two men cornered Sarwan on Wednesday morning and beat him up.

On seeing Sarwanâ€™s bruised state, his father approached Phagan Singh and warned him to behave properly and also told him to ask his sons to apologise to Sarwan. Enraged by Dharam Nathâ€™s warning, the two men first beat up their father and then their mother, said Rani.

Madhu alleged inaction on part of the Civil Hospital, which refused to admit Dharam Nath, despite him being in acute pain. Instead Satpalâ€™s wife, who was sent to the hospital for a medical treatment probably to put counter blame on the girlsâ€™ parents and brother, was attended to by the doctors, added Madhu. But the doctor on the duty said that the injured did not require to be hospitalised.

It is learnt that on a complaint by the girlsâ€™ family, the police registered a case under Sections 294 (obscene songs), 341 (wrongfully restraining any person), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC at the Sarabhanagar police station. The police denied having the men in their custody, though the buzz in the mohalla was that they had detained the duo. When contacted, SHO Balvinder Singh said he was not aware of any such case.

15,Residents protest land-grab,"PATHANKOT: Residents of Suliara Nagar, near Baba Balak Nath Temple, are more than unhappy with the Pathankot Municipal Council. They allege that certain influential parties in connivance with a government official have grabbed 20 feet wide â€˜Kuhalâ€™ land for construction of houses. They allege that the sewage drains running through the area have been choked. Consequently, the collecting sullage other than giving off a foul odour is a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies, not to mention a hotbed of diseases.

In their memorandum to Punjab governor Lt Gen (retd) J F R Jacob who visited Ghoh village here on Tuesday, a delegation of women complained about the choking of the â€˜Kuhalâ€™ as well as land grabbing by influential persons who are getting houses constructed on the plot.

Residents have been forced to live in inhumane conditions thanks to the blocking of the sullage. In their memorandum to the governor, Bimla Devi and Santosh Kumari said that they had submitted similar memoranda to the Gurdaspur Deputy Commissioner, the SSP, Pathankot MC president, Pathankot SDM and executive officer of Pathankot MC, but nothing had been done to stop the construction of the houses so far.

The angry women told Times News Network that the municipal engineer was hand in glove with the land grabbers which is why action had not been taken against them.

While Jacob asked Gurdaspur DC K A P Sinha to help the residents, official sources say that Pathankot SDM Punit Goyal had marked an inquiry to the executive officer of the Pathankot MC on March 21. Despite this, for reasons best known to the official concerned no action has been taken against the land grabbers. As for now the â€˜Kuhalâ€™ has dried up.

The permanent stream which not only drained the seasonal rain water, but also carried sullage from surrounding residential colonies has been blocked due to encroachment, residents say.

16,First phase elicits good response from farmers,"BATHINDA: As a solution to the non-sustainable cropping pattern, these days diversification seems to be a most sought after solution to the crisis that Punjab agriculture is undergoing. The initial response to the diversification programme under multi-crop multiyear contract farming, a scheme of Punjab Agro Foodgrains Corporation Ltd (PAFCL) launched in January this year, is reportedly very encouraging all over the state.

Though the Punjab government has plans of bringing four lakh acres of land under contract farming for various cash crops as an alternative to paddywheat rotation for Kharif and Rabi season during 2003-04, the initial response to the programme has shown more and more marginal farmers eager to join it.

PAFCL has already received applications for contract farming from farmers for sowing on about 1.90 lakh acres against its target of starting the scheme on about 1.70 lakh acres this Kharif season, said Kirpa Shankar Saroj, managing director (MD), PAFCL.

He told The Times of India that some farmers, who had joined hands with PAFCL in the last Rabi season, got very good result. It encouraged other farmers as well, who now want to shed wheat-paddy rotation. He said that PAFCL made successful farming of hyola mustard on about 10,000 acres in Gurdaspur district and barley malt on 943 acres in Sangrur and Patiala districts in the last Rabi season, which fetched the farmers very good price of their produce.

In the next Rabi season, the department is planning to bring about 10,000 acres land under barley malt cultivation in Sangrur and Patiala. As barley malt is used for beverage industry for producing beer and wine, there should not be problem of marketing it, said Saroj. He said that for Kharif season, a target of 1,00,000 acres had been fixed for cultivation of basmati and more stress would be given on nontraditional areas of Faridkot, Muktsar, Bathinda and Mansa for growing basmati.

While about 50,000 acres have been fixed for fertilisation of export quality guar gum (gawar), maize would be sown in about 60,000 acres. As the state is facing potato glut and prices touching rock-bottom these days, the PAFCL has chosen potato growing area all over the state for cultivation of sunflower crop, as it requires same soil condition. PAFCL is busy these days organising programmes in rural areas for farmers to give them more information regarding contract farming.

Saroj said that clusters of small and marginal farmers, clubbing 60 to 100 acres land, were being formed in villages for better farming.

He expected major swing from paddy-wheat rotation to other cash crops under contractual system once the results would be before farmers in the next six months.

17,Monitor ground reality on drought: Modi to ministers,"GANDHINAGAR: Concerned with intensifying drought situation in Gujarat, Chief Minister Narendra Modi asked his Cabinet colleagues on Wednesday to start monitoring the ground-level reality directly. Till now, only senior IAS bureaucrats were doing the job, with each one having been given a group of talukas.

Modi said at the Cabinet meeting, held after the lapse of a fortnight, that ministers should start taking surprise visits to ensure that the administration was well-geared to take care of the drought.

The CM''s instructions came even as top leaders in the BJP have started feeling uneasy about the government undermining the severity of drought in several areas of North Gujarat, Kutch and Saurashtra. MLAs and senior leaders have complained to ministers that the state has ''underestimated the number of villages'', said a top insider. While the state declared 6,021 villages belonging to 115 talukas of 14 districts as drought-affected, ''the real figure should have been nearly 10,000.''

BJP sources allege that instructions were issued from the top in Gandhinagar not to include ''too many villages as drought-affected''. As a result, there is acute scarcity of fodder and increasing complaints of animal deaths as also instances of hunger among the workers at relief sites. The Cabinet admitted that the truckers'' strike had affected the movement of essential commodities to the scarcity-hit areas. It appealed to the truckers to ''cooperate'' at least for carrying fodder and food items to their destination.

Even as seeking to distance from the criticism being levelled by BJP insiders about undermining the drought intensity, the Cabinet admitted that a ''drought crisis'' had emerged and it was necessary to take ''all necessary steps to fight it so as to help the affected people by providing relief jobs, fodder and drinking water urgently.'' Cabinet spokesperson IK Jadeja told newspersons, ""Already, 7.29 lakh workers were getting relief at the sites in the affected villages.""

Jadeja said the state had so far spent Rs 181.37 crore on drought out of a total of Rs 900 crore drought-relief plan. Of this, Rs 54.81 crore went as wages to relief workers, Rs 6.21 crore as cash doles to the vulnerable sections of the population that could not work at the relief camps and Rs 12.84 crore as subsidy to the cattle camps. This apart, as many as 1,657 villages were being supplied water by 1,205 tankers. Yet, he insisted, this year''s drought intensity was ''less than that of 1999-2000.''

He denied reports that above 700 cattle had died in Sabarkantha on account of drought. ""Not one cattle has perished. This is humbug. Just as there is mortality rate for human beings, there is one for animals, too. One does not notice any sharp rise in the rate of death among amimals. It remains between 2.5 to 3.5 per cent, depending on different areas as in the past. I have not received any case of people going hungry on account of drought,"" he said.

18,Red rule: File nominations at your own peril,"ASANSOL: Even Mangru Kazi, the nephew of rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and a former Left Front supporter, incurred the wrath of the CPM in this red belt.

His fault? He and his followers had filed nominations for 11 seats at the red bastion of Churulia, the birthplace of the poet, as Independent candidates, while the Opposition parties including the Trinamul Congress, Congress and the BJP have failed to put up candidates for the Jamuria gram panchayat seats.

On Monday night, thousands of CPM supporters gheraoed his residence and Kazi, along with his family, fled to Asansol after locking up the Nazrul Academy at Churulia.

Sources said that he had sought the courtâ€™s protection. The same evening, CPM leaders led by Jamuria Municipality chairman Tapas Kabi and Jamuria MLA Pelab Kabi filed an FIR with the Jamuria police station, alleging that Kazi was terrorising them.

So, for fear of getting killed, Kazi and his family hid the whole night in a paddy field.

Meanwhile, the Trinamul, BJP, Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party withdrew nominations from 64 of the 83 gram panchayat seats, with the Front having already won the remaining 19 seats uncontested.

The Opposition withdrew nominations from Egra, Ratibati, Jemari, Tirat, Ballavpur, Amrasota, JK Nagar and Kalipahari seats in Raniganj block. Raniganj Trinamul Congress sabhapati Senapati Mondal alleged that seven of his party candidates at Jemari had been threatened with dire consequences for filing nominations.

â€œEven women were not spared. They were told they would become widows and in Egra and Ratibati the two candidates were abducted and forced to withdraw under gunpoint,â€� he added. Naturally, the Opposition had no other alternative than to withdraw from the fray.

Burdwan district Congress president Tapas Banerjee said that he had never seen such terror as unleashed by the CPM this time in his entire political career.

He even claimed that the houses of three candidates at Nimcha had been gheraoed for a few days after which they withdrew. Ujra Mohan Jha, proposer of the Congress candidate Shankar Hembram at Jemari, was abducted, too, he alleged.

BDO Rashbehari Das said there was no substance in the Opposition complaints so far. State cottage and small-scale industry minister Bansagopal Chowdhury derided the Opposition allegations as baseless.

He told TNN that last time the Opposition had won five seats in the area and this time fearing a rout it was trying to make it an issue out of sheer frustration.

â€œHere they have filed nominations even at the red bastions of Ballavpur, J.K. Nagar areas and no one was forced to withdraw,â€� emphasised Chowdhury.

19,Pandya murder: Did govt overlook crucial intelligence?,"AHMEDABAD: The state government had ample intelligence about the threats to firebrand political leaders and public places before Haren Pandya''s murder, but some of them were dismissed as ""routine"". All those who screamed ""intelligence failure"" after Pandya was shot dead in cold blood near Law Garden, might be quite off the mark.

The state government, through the CID (Intelligence), had been receiving inputs about possible attacks on political leaders and ""Hindu shrines"" till as late as March 22, four days before the attack on Pandya.

According to sources, these inputs had been coming since January, prior to Republic Day, but one specific input about Gujarat''s youths being trained by the ISI is said to have been received around March 10! These messages were sent to the police in all districts of the state.

This means that the intelligence mechanism to track down the specifics of this input may have been activated only after the Pandya murder. The state police, however, claim: ""Intelligence about the ISI-trained suspects, who were rounded up on April 3, came only a couple of days after the Pandya murder.""

Reliable information acquired by TNN reveals that the state government was warned in early March about 80-100 youths from Gujarat being trained in the Kasur district of Pakistan''s Lahore division. The input stated that the youths were trained at one ''Mujahid battalion'', 7 km off Chunian tehsil in this district, and that they were likely to be pushed back into the country to target ""Hindu shrines"".

But nothing much was done about this suspected exfiltration despite the reported disappearance of youths studying in a madrassa in Bharuch. Again, in Ahmedabad there were reports of some 33 youths having been identified at a relief camp for training and indoctrination into ''jehad''.

Around March 22, yet another piece of intelligence, which was treated as ""general"", referred to a meeting of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the ISI and the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). The meeting reportedly discussed strategies to terrorise the states of Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Plans to target leaders like Chief Minister Narendra Modi, VHP leader Pravin Togadia and deputy prime minister L K Advani were hatched. References were also made to ""more Akshardham kind of attacks"".

Not to miss the letter reportedly received by Union minister of state for home Harin Pathak in February which talked about threats to 15 BJP leaders and three Ahmedabad police officers.

""We receive hundreds of such letters and tip-offs about threats to people''s lives and other things. But most of them turn out to be hoaxes,"" said a senior police officer. Such ""hoaxes"" had increased after the post-Godhra riots.

Officials might dismiss this exercise as ""routine"", but Pandya''s family continues to be foxed by the fact that the state, which never saw the need to protect him after he stepped down from the ministry, rushed security personnel to his house soon after he was killed.
