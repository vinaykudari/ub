2,Munde protests total privatisation of power,"PUNE: While emphasising upon the need to undertake drastic measures for improving the functioning of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), BJP leader Gopinath Munde has, however, warned that ""total privatisation"" of the MSEB will go against the state''s interests.

Munde, who held the state energy portfolio during his tenure as deputy chief minister of the state, asserted that total privatisation was not the solution to improve the power sector.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a builders'' conference in the city on Friday, Munde, however, admitted that he was yet through go through the white paper on power reforms. He made it clear that any decision should be taken only after taking MSEB employees into confidence. Asked about the state government''s decision to scale down his security, Munde said, ""Perhaps they (government) think I don''t need security. I have nothing to say on it.""

3,Inviting Sonia to form govt in '99 not illegal: Centre,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has submitted before the Delhi High Court that no illegality was committed by the President in asking Congress President Sonia Gandhi to explore the possibility of forming the ministry after the fall of the Vajpayee government in 1999, either on the question of her not being then the Leader of Opposition or her foreign origin.""It is denied that the President of India violated the basic structure of the Constitution... But it is submitted that he acted within its basic framework,"" Law Ministry said in an affidavit in reply to a petition challenging the inviation to Gandhi mainly on two counts -- that she is not a natural born citizen and was not then the Leader of the Opposition.On the question of Gandhi's citizenship, the Government said, ""There is only one class of citizens in India and it is submitted that once the citizenship is acquired under the Citizenship Act, 1955, there is no distinction thereafter either by birth or acquired under the law.""A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a private organisation Rashtriya Mukti Morcha (RMM) had challenged the the invitation to Gandhi alleging that she had not forfeited her Italian citizenship and therefore, her acquiring the Indian citizenship would not be complete.A Bench comprising Justice Vijender Jain and Justice R S Sodhi last week posted further hearing on the petition in November saying the matter would be heard by a division Bench before which it was listed earlier. The PIL said Gandhi was not the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha at that time, who has to be called by the President after the fall of a Government. The affidavit said Articles 58, 66 and 84 of the Constitution have laid down the qualifications for contesting election to the office of President, Vice-President and Members of Parliament, which are available to a citizen under the Constitution and the Citizenship Act and ""there is only one class of citizens in India.""The RMM had alleged that proper procedure was not followed by the Union Home Ministry in granting the citizenship to Gandhi. Its counsel, senior advocate P N Lekhi, has contended that under the Italian laws a citizen never forfeits his/her citizenship, while the requirement under the Indian laws was that a person could not have a dual citizenship.Since Gandhi could not forfeit her Italian citizenship as per the laws of that country, the citzenship acquired by her in India would be violative of the Constitutional as well as the Citizenship Act provision, Lekhi contended.The petitioner has also questioned considering the name of a foreign born person to the high constitutional posts, saying in all leading democracies of the world - the US, Germany, France and several other European countries - a foreign born citizen is prohibited from heading such offices.Lekhi contended that though the Constituent Assembly had an intensive debate on this issue, it left the question open as the leaders and constitutional experts, who were its members, ""had never visualised a situation where a person of foreign origin would ever be considered for an important post of the Prime Minister.""He submitted that in the US it was specifically debarred on the consideration that it would pose a threat to the country's integrity and security.

4,J&K polls: The issues,"NEW DELHI: The issues are the same but some faces are new. As a third generation Abdullah ascends the National Conference throne, Elections 2002 in Jammu and Kashmir are set to be unlike any other. Perhaps, a more representative process.Political observers expect the presence of foreign media and the glare of the international community at large to ensure that the September elections will also see the least rigging ever. ""This is the right time to restart the political process. People have witnessed a phase in the 1990s when there was no political process. It resulted in chaos. They have realised that even a sham democracy is better than anarchy,"" says Kashmir expert Riaz Punjabi.Punjabi says separatists sitting on the fence will lose out if they miss this opportunity to participate. ""Peace talks are an ongoing process, sometimes slow, other times intense. Let us not tie up the two issues. They should contest now and if they establish their representative credibility, all the better for them. If the dialogue process ends two or three years from now, they can't just go ahead and dissolve the Assembly then.""With only a few weeks before the elections, the situation is still fluid. The Centre, through the Kashmir Committee under Ram Jethmalani, has brought separatists to the negotiating table. It seems a matter of time before they agree to join the political process. Separatist leader Shabir Shah is already talking elections. There is new blood not only at the helm of National Conference affairs, but also in the Hurriyat, with assassinated leader Abdul Ghani Lone's sons Sajjad and Bilal taking over from their father. With battle lines being defined, major players are fast getting their act together.National Conference: It is official now. The NC will contest the elections under the 32-year-old Omar Abdullah with father Farooq Abdullah headed to Parliament. The party has won all Assembly elections fought in Jammu and Kashmir post-Independence and winning this one too is crucial. Omar will contest as the party's chief ministerial candidate from the Ganderbal constituency, which has been Abdullah territory since 1975. Farooq has won thrice from Ganderbal. The father-son duo would like to be seen as taking on the establishment now that elections are near. Omar, ever since he took over the party reins, has scarcely spoken in the voice of a Central minister. From the moment he was anointed, he has joined issue with the Centre for its handling of the Kashmir issue, at the core being the autonomy issue which the party rode to power the last time around in 1996.For the NC it could be a matter of survival. The family has internationally been the face of political Kashmir and its indubitable clout in the Valley has helped it secure a foothold in national politics. But there have been accusations in every election of mass rigging by the NC and the party could face a backlash if more and more separatists join the fray in disregard to the Hurriyat decision to boycott the elections.""The chances of the National Conference are good. But it will be tougher than last time, since it is more difficult to fight elections when in you are in power"", says Omar Abdullah.All-Parties Hurriyat Conference: The 23-member coalition of separatist groups is clear on one thing: elections as such are not important, a solution to the Kashmir issue is. It has said before that if there is ""enough guarantee that the process will be the first step towards a dialogue process leading to resolution of the Kashmir issue,"" it can consider contesting elections.The Hurriyat has been demanding a trilateral dialogue to solve the Kashmir dispute. It has already lost a top leader and moderate Abdul Ghani Lone, who was assassinated in the run-up to the polls in a setback to the dialogue process. The Hurriyat also believes free and fair elections are not possible under the NC regime. As of now, it has said it will not participate in the elections. But that does not seem to be the final word from those quarters. For the conglomerate, riven as it is with factionalism and differences of opinions between hardliners and moderates, is even now unravelling as individuals are quitting to fight elections as independents. Political observers say many in the coalition are now torn, realising they have to prove their representative character and also fearing that they may be summarily dumped by Pakistan. A Hurriyat executive council meeting on Monday may again see a new turn of events.""As of now the Hurriyat will not participate in the elections. But it is not opposed to the electoral process if it is part of the entire process of dialogue for a negotiated settlement to the Kashmir problem"", says Hurriyat spokesman in Delhi A M Bandey. The Independents: Ghulam Mohiuddin Sofi may be a trendsetter of sorts. The senior leader of the People's Conference -- one of the main components of the Hurriyat -- insists his decision to contest the elections stems from slain leader Lone's vision. Sofi quit the Hurriyat to file his nomination for the Handwara Assembly seat this week. Four other key leaders of the People's Conference have followed and are contesting as independent candidates across north Kashmir. Also joining the political process are surrendered Hizbul Mujahideen commander Imran Rahi and a former Jamaat-e-Islami functionary Abdul Khaliq Parray alias Haneef, who have filed their nomination papers from Kupwara and Sonawari respectively. More are expected to follow. The mass appeal is big. When Sofi filed his nomination papers from Handwara, a crowd of 15,000 cheered. Political watchers admit that if 10 such people join the fray, that could be 10 sure-shot seats for them if rigging is minimised.The move by Sofi and his ilk has the Hurriyat scrambling to save face, with leaders talking in different voices.""This is their (the Centre's) last chance to restore our confidence in the electoral process. If they allow the NC to rig these polls, then everything will turn into ashes,'' says Ghulam Mohiuddin Sofi. Congress: The national party which ruled India for over 40 years has a few areas of influence in Jammu and Kashmir. Almost decimated in the state through its propping up of Farooq, subsequent Congress regimes at the Centre failed to stem the rot in the state. For the elections, the party is attempting to regroup and marshal its resources under Ghulam Nabi Azad, who the party feels has vitalised party cadres lying dormant. In 1996, say party leaders, faulty ticket distribution and the ""large-scale rigging"" saw the party fare badly. The Congress has just six seats in the J&K Assembly. This time the party has been proactive and rather optimistically hopes to get about 27 seats. The party feels it will perform well in Jammu, Udhampur, Kathua, Doda, Rajouri and Poonch, and is aiming to swing the BJP's support base in these regions. The party wants Governor's rule in J&K before the elections to ensure fair polls. ""If Congress had been at the helm at the Centre now, the process of bringing the separatists back into the mainstream would have been a more successful affair. The Congress is on a comeback trail. These elections will definitely mark its revival in the state,"" says Satyajit Gaekwad, who looks after J&K affairs in the Congress.BJP and RSS-supported outfits: The BJP is targetting its traditional constituency, the Jammu region. The party will have seat adjustment with the Jammu State Morcha, a group of smaller parties that are demanding separate statehood for Jammu. The RSS in a resolution has made the same demand, and Sangh cadres will actively assist the morcha in electioneering.Party leaders are quick to point out that the BJP differs on the issue. While it supports the need to address the deep-rooted feeling of discrimination and neglect of the people in the region"" it's proposed mechanism is different. The BJP has suggested setting up of regional councils. However, since there is no dispute on the basic outstanding complaint of the region, the BJP believes it would be prudent not to divide votes. Hence the understanding that it will not put up candidates where the morcha will and vice versa. The party will also contest seats in the Valley, where it is looking for similar understanding with groups and formations which have candidates to defeat National Conference or Congress nominees. Planning its campaign with care, the BJP has picked Kashmiri Pandits who have migrated to Jammu and also Delhi to fight elections in the Valley, apart from local Muslim candidates. It hopes to better its performance of 8 seats in the outgoing Assembly.""We have good appeal in Jammu. But the objective is to avoid division of votes. The Congress and the NC, who have ruled the state are responsible for the discontent among the people. Those who stand to end this discrimination should join hands"", says O P Kohli, in charge of J&K affairs, BJP.The others: There are smaller players with pockets of influence in Kashmir. The BSP, with a following among the Muslims, has four seats in the present Assembly. There is also the People's Democratic party led by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Bhim Singh's Panthers Party. Even the CPM has a seat in the 87-member Assembly.

5,Omar welcomes Hurriyat dissidents to J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: National Conference President Omar Abdullah on Sunday welcomed the decision of ""certain sections"" of Hurriyat Conference to participate in the coming Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls saying the move was a reflection of people''s mood in favour of the democratic process.

""Majority of Hurriyat leaders have understood the popular mood of the people that they want to face ballots and not bullets. The decision of major constituents of Hurriyat to participate in the polls is a welcome step,"" Omar said here.

People''s Conference, a party in the amalgam, has fielded four ""dummy candidates"" from four Assembly constituencies in Kupwara district. Founder-leader of the party Abdul Gani Lone, who was assassinated by militants on June 21 this year, used to fight from this district.

Several other second rung leaders of the amalgam have either decided to contest or field dummy candidates which includes Khalil Hanief, a front-ranking Jamaat-e-Islami leader.

Omar said ""there are some sensible"" people within the amalgam who took statements of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani that the Centre would hold talks with ""those who emerge as elected representatives"" in the right spirit.

6,Talks with Kashmir parties after polls: Jaitley,"NEW DELHI: Without commenting on the work of Kashmir Committee, Centre''s interlocutor on devolution of powers to the state Arun Jaitley on Sunday said his brief did not relate to elections and that he would continue talks with all concerned after the polls were over.

""The subject matter of my discussions are not election related or participation of any group therein,"" said Jaitley, speaking for the first time since his appointment as interlocutor by the Centre.

""It only relates to the constitutional issues of Centre-State relationship and the need for devolution of powers if any,"" he said.

He said he had two rounds of talks with the National Conference Government representative G M Shah and added the third round of talks scheduled for the end of last month was deferred as Shah was busy with elections.

""After I finish my discussions with the State Government, I would certainly be inviting other political parties and such groups which wish to express their views on the subject,"" the former Law Minister and BJP General Secretary said.

However, Jaitley refused to comment on the recent efforts of Kashmir Committee, headed by former Law Minister Ram Jethmalani, who had several rounds of talks with senior separatist leader Shabir Shah.

Both Shah and Jethmalani had criticised the Government for lack of initiative to undertake a dialogue process with elements playing an important role in the state.

7,"Evaluation of 45,000 govt schools soon","BANGALORE: With the objective of providing quality education to children and ensuring that those in the 6 to 14 age-group go to school, the state government decided to evaluate the 45,000-odd government schools in October 2001. The process is expected to be completed by 2003. Already, 7,000 schools have been evaluated and that of another 15,000 is expected by this year-end. ``As inspections by block education officers failed to provide a clear picture of what ailed a particular school, we decided to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of schools,'''' education department officials told The Times of India. The evaluation process involves teams with people from DIET, cluster and block resource centres and retired teachers and experts, who visit the schools, spend a few days with them and evaluate them against pre-set parameters. Manuals published by the department to help the team contain the objectives of the evaluation process. It has also laid down guidelines for evaluation. The team observes the following aspects of each school: learning environment, seating arrangements, textbooks and learning material, teaching aids, lesson plans and time schedule for each subject, teaching and learning methods, teachers interaction with students, students involvement and teachers'' attitude towards students. Besides, information about students who regularly abstain from school and the retention rate is also collected during evaluation. Later, the team prepares an evaluation report, copies of which are given to the school head, block education officer and education coordinator/deputy director of public instruction. ``After the report is submitted, the school head prepares an action plan for its implementation and submits an action taken report within 30 days. The education coordinator and block education officer monitor the implementation of the report,'''' officials explained. At the district level, a team headed by deputy director and senior department officials monitor the implementation of the report and submit a consolidated report to the commissioner of public instruction. ``It is for the first time that such a mammoth exercise of evaluating schools is being carried out on such a large scale. We propose to conduct the exercise once in three years to understand the progress made in the development of a school,'''' officials said. The department also plans to make copies of the reports available to the public so that prospective parents get a clear picture about a particular school.

8,BJP-led govt deviating from basic issues: VHP,"NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Sunday criticised the BJP-led government for ""deviating from the Hindutva agenda"" and indulging in vote bank politics to remain in power.

""We had great expectations from the current government, but were disillusioned by its performance,"" VHP International president Vishnu Hari Dalmia said, expressing concern that terrorist organisations were spreading their tentacles far and wide and ""no government had ever taken strong steps to prevent this"".

Speaking on the occassion of 38th foundation day of the VHP, he said that there was a strong need for all Hindus to unite and bring a government that would take care of their interests.

Referring to the Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Dalmia said ""such a govenment should be installed in the state which takes care of the interests of the state as a whole.""

""We were forced to demand the trifurcation of J&K as we realised that all the Central funds to the state went to the valley and Jammu and Ladakh were ignored,"" he said.

Terming the reaction to the Godhra incident as a ""victory"", VHP working president Ashok Singhal said ""it was the first act of unity from the Hindus who till now had led a subdued life.""

Describing the killings at Godhra as an attempt by Pakistan to set off a series of violent acts throughout the country, Singhal accused J&K Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah of pushing the same agenda.

9,J&K polls need no foreign observer: Ramamohan Rao,"PUNE: Information consultant to the Union defence minister, I. Ramamohan Rao, has ruled out the need for international observers during the forthcoming polls there.

Rao said the chief election commissioner (CEC) had already deputed senior IAS officials from different states to act as poll observers in J&K. â€œBesides, officials, with knowledge of Urdu, have been drawn from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to actually supervise election work,â€� added Rao, who has been media advisor to the J&K government when it was under Presidentâ€™s rule.

Importantly, Rao pointed out, the Centre had also permitted all embassies in New Delhi to send their officials to J&K during the polls. â€œEven foreign mediapersons, in their large numbers, will be free to visit the state and write about it their perceptions,â€� he said.

The media advisor said the army had been given the task of creating a security environment throughout the valley by keeping a check on intrusions and infiltration.

More than 400 companies of police have been geared up for the elections in the state.

â€œEvery candidate has been given protection so that the public has confidence in the polls,â€� he added.

10,AP govt's move may trigger rice war with Punjab,"NEW DELHI: It may not be in the same league as the long drawn-out battle between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over the sharing of Cauvery waters. But the rejection of Punjab rice by the Andhra Pradesh government on the plea that it is of â€˜â€˜poor quality'''' does have the potential of sparking off an inter-state row.

The state, which prides itself on ushering in the â€˜â€˜Green Revolution'''' and making the country self-sufficient in foodgrains, now finds itself at the receiving end.

Two years ago, the Punjab government forced the Centre to revise its procurement norms when the FCI refused to lift â€˜â€˜poor quality'''' paddy stocks.

In the latest instance, Andhra chief minister Chandrababu Naidu refused to lift the last consignment of five lakh tonnes of Punjab rice, sanctioned by the Centre for its food-for-work programme, saying it is inedible. This latest consignment was part of the 31 lakh tonnes which was released to Andhra for what is jocularly referred to as the â€˜â€˜food-for-support programme''''.

Naidu''s requests for â€˜â€˜more'''' have, usually been met without any fuss, even overriding the agriculture ministry''s objections that a team first assess the progress on the food-for-work programme before the release of each consignment.

Naidu, who was in the Capital last week, sought expeditious clearance of his state''s pending projects.

The TDP leader, who is a valued ally of the NDA government and is wont to have his way on his demands, had met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, deputy PM Advani and agriculture minister Ajit Singh during his whistlestop tour.
