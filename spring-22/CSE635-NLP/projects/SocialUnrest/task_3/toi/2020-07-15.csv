2,How can minister give 'verdict'? asks HC,"PATNA: Patna High Court on Tuesday remarked how can a minister, who is a policy-maker, be termed ""state"" and adjudicate in quasi-judicial matters.

A division bench, comprising Chief Justice R S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh, took notice of the verdict given by the urban development minister, wherein he had set aside the orders of the Jehanabad collector and the Gaya commissioner with regard to the renewal of the licence of a cinema hall.

The matter related to the renewal of the licence of Prabhat Talkies in Jehanabad. The collector and the commissioner had rejected the claim for the renewal of the licence of the cinema hall to Awadhesh Kumar Prasad Sinha and instead granted licence to Baban Sharma.

Against this order, Awadhesh Kumar Prasad Sinha had moved in a special appeal before the government which was eventually heard by the urban development minister who set aside the order of the collector and the DM and allowed the renewal of the former''s licence.

Baban Sharma challenged the minister''s order in a writ petition. A single bench of the high court, presided over by Justice Aftab Alam, allowed the plea of Baban Sharma and rejected the claim of Awadhesh Kumar Prasad Sinha for the renewal of the licence.

Sinha had moved in a Letters Patent Appeal before the division bench presided over by the Chief Justice.

The division bench observed that the minister''s passing order in quasi-judicial capacity was prima facie wrong as this matter was supposed to be heard by the state government. The judges observed that the minister, being a part in the enactment of law, cannot decide a dispute on the basis of the same law.

Removal of garbage: A division bench of the high court, comprising Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice Rajendra Prasad, on Tuesday directed the chief executive officer of Patna Municipal Corporation, A B Prasad, to check any laxity in removal of garbage in the city.

The matter was raised through a PIL. The high court had earlier directed the PMC to remove garbage from the entire city. The PMC chief executive officer submitted that the work had been started on a war footing.

Re-boring done: A Patna Water Board (PWB) official submitted before the court that re-boring had been done at the old tube well site, adjacent to the local A N College campus on Boring road. Clean water would come out of the boring soon to enable the PWB to increase the quantum of water supply.

3,Congress to strengthen Mufti govt,"NEW DELHI: All is well in Jammu and Kashmir. After J&K Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed met Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the Congress general secretary Ambika Soni on Tuesday asserted that the coalition government is doing well and the situation has improved dramatically in the state.

The Congress has come to Mufti''s rescue after an ally, the CPM-led People''s Democratic Forum, threatened to withdraw support to the government. CPM leader Yousuf Tarigami has also sought the dissolution of the coordination committee of the coalition government since it has only met twice in the past six months.

Though there is no threat to the government, the Congress has taken note of Tarigami''s outburst and promised an early meeting of the coordination panel. Soni said that the panel would meet after Congress state chief and coordination committee chairman Gulam Nabi Azad returns from abroad next week.

The party had recently in Shimla acknowledged the importance of a dialogue with various groups in the state which would obviously include separatists. This Soni said would take time, ``there have to be ground preparations to initiate a dialogue''''. And she asserted that the preparations are underway with the developmental activities gaining momentum.

One of the thorny issues that the Congress had to sort out with the coalition partner was the release of innocent political partners. Though the party was bound by the common minimum programme, the Congress was embarrassed by the BJP using this issue on the eve of Himachal Pradesh elections to gain some political mileage.

However the Congress maintains that this has not stalled the process and that the mechanism of release of innocent prisoners remains the same: through court orders after going through screening committees. Though other allies are disappointed with the pace of the ``healing touch measures'''' the Congress claims that developmental activities are the first step to bring in peace and normalcy.

Also, after last month''s Congress CMs conclave, Gandhi and Mufti had held a joint rally at Baramullah and gave appointment orders to family members of victims of violence in the valley. The Congress claims success in getting all the district development boards to meet in the last few months. The funds have been devolved to the local bodies as well, said Soni.

5,Godhra riots victims depose before probe panel,"AHMEDABAD: The two-member Riot Inquiry Commission, comprising Justice (retd) G T Nanavati and Justice (retd) K G Shah, on Wednesday began recording deposition of the victims of post-Godhra communal violence that affected many parts of the city.

However, only four persons -- two advocates, a restaurateur and a deputy sarpanch -- deposed before the commission.

The police station areas designated for the day for victims or complainants to come forward were Satellite and Ellisbridge.

In spite of reassuring words from both the commission members urging people to come and depose ""freely and fearlessly"" the response was relatively poor.

Triveni Sharma, an advocate who lives in Satellite area told the commission members that on February 28, the day VHP had given a Gujarat bandh call following the Sabarmati train carnage at Godhra, ''Hindu mobs'' had indulged in arson and loot.

Sharma said she was sure that the mob consisted of people of ''Hindu community'' but could not specify if people were from the same neighbourhood and added that she did not lodge a police complaint in this regard earlier and was giving these details for the first time.

Amrish Patel, the other advocate also specified that mobs that had indulged in arson and loot in the area were of ''Hindu community ''and some even wore saffrons band on their head.

Patel said he was confronted by a mob near Shivranjani area where policemen were present at several spots where violence took place but they were all ''mute spectators''.

The advocate also deposed that police did not take any action against the mob inspite of repeated requests.

The third witness to depose before the commission today was Mulji Solanki, a restaurateur who lost four of his properties after mobs ransacked and torched it in Satellite and Ambawadi areas of the city in the first two days of the communal riots.

Deposing before the Commission Solanki said the restaurants were co-owned by him and four of his Muslim partners.

He said that four of his restaurants namely ""Abhilasha"", ""Topaz"", ""Kabir"" and ""Tasty"" were all targetted because of their Muslim ownership as no other restaurant in the area was torched.

Solanki said he even managed to save 10 employees of one restaurant on the first day of the violence but got to know a day later that three were trapped inside and had died.

He said police constables were present when mobs had ransacked and torched ''Tasty'' restaurant which is very close to the Chief Justice''s bungalow and located right opposite a police post.

When advocate Mukul Sinha who cross-examined the witness asked if either of the restaurants had appeared to be run by Muslims from its outer appearance, Solanki replied in the negative and said ""that could be known only if such specific information was sought"".

Solanki, answering another question said that it did not appear that the mobs were acting at the behest of other competitors in the area.

The fourth witness for the day Bharat Patel, deputy sarpanch of Vastrapur gram panchayat, said that police presence in his area was adequate and violence did not touch the area.

Advocates present for the deposition later told PTI that the poor response from the people was a ""clear sign of lack of public interest"".

Advocate Arvind Pandya appeared as special counsel for the Gujarat government while advocate Nigam Shukla was the government counsel.

6,PM blames state govt for poor industrial growth,"KOLKATA: Taking a simultaneous dig at Marxism as well as at the Left Front government in West Bengal, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Wednesday said â€œthe arrival of dogmatism"" in the state had seen ""the departure of development"" from it. ""Bengal has a lot of catching up to do,"" he observed.

Vajpayee was speaking at a function to observe the 150th anniversary of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kolkata. Among those who sat on the dais when Vajpayee launched a pungent attack on the state of work culture in the state was Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

Describing West Bengal as the ""undisputed leader and promoter of industrial culture"" till the late 1960s, he wondered: ""Why did it lose its way thereafter?"" He provided the reply also. ""Outsiders can only surmise that the arrival of dogmatism saw the departure of development. Sometimes in the affairs of organisations, provinces and even nations, extreme positions rule the roost for some time, but the price of the folly is paid for years and decades to come.""

Hinting at lack of work culture in state government offices, he called upon ""the entire government machinery, right down to the last clerk,"" to ""gear itself up with a new work culture and a new pro-growth mindset.""

Expressing concern at the situation in the state, he said till 1981 the per capita income of West Bengal was above the national average, two decades later it had fallen below the national average. For West Bengal, the need for employment and self-employment opportunities were particularly acute. These ""cannot be created without faster economic growth.""

Appreciating the ""new approach (of the state government) of partnership with the private sector,"" he said ""this change needs expansion and acceleration."" According to him : ""Winds of change are blowing in Bengal, but quite mildly so far."" He advised the state government ""to create a strong pro-business and pro-investment environment in West Bengal.""

The Prime Minister was, however, ready to extend ''full co-operation'' to the state government in its effort to accelerate development. ""I am sure the state government has no reason now to repeat the decades-old complaint that the Centre is discriminating against the state.""

Elaborating the policy of the NDA government, he said : ""We need harmonious and co-operative relations between the Centre and the states."" He claimed that its track record in the past five years showed that ""we do not follow the policy of discrimination on political and ideological grounds."" He agreed that West Bengal had the infrastructure necessary for economic revival, colleges, professional institutions, scientists, administrators and professionals.

The state had made a beginning in new economic enterprises like information technology, bio technology, pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals. ""There is some improvement in some aspects of infrastructure, a slow revival of business sentiments,"" he added.

7,"Govt goes on poll overdrive, farm loan rate halved","NEW DELHI: Public sector banks will provide crop loans up to Rs 50,000 to farmers at maximum 9 per cent, nearly half the rate at present, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh and agriculture minister Rajnath Singh announced on Wednesday.

Making no secret of the fact that the government was in a please-all election mode, the FM said the slashing of the farm loan rate is in the series of measures, including the pension scheme and the health insurance scheme launched by the Prime Minister earlier this week.

""We (the two ministers) are also meeting the PM on Thursday to sort out the problems being faced by sugarcane growers,"" he said. The FM maintained that not only would the banks be able to absorb the rate cut, they would also meet the target of extending 18 per cent of all bank credit to agriculture.

He dismissed the notion that the government had reintroduced ""administered"" interest rates. He said the Indian Banks Association, which is the association of public sector banks, has directed its members to cut crop loan rate to a maximum of 9 per cent.

As part of the package to ease credit flow, NABARD will directly refinance cooperative banks at the district level enabling them to lend to farmers also at nine per cent. A pilot project to make available farm loans through post offices will also be launched on September 1 in Tamil Nadu. If successful, it will be extended to other states, the FM said.

The agriculture minister termed the slashing of agriculture credit rate as ""a historic step"" and said it would help make Indian farmers internationally competitive and increase their incomes and purchasing power.

""As a result of reduction in the rate of interest on agricultural loans, it is expected that farmers will get the benefit of Rs 2,500 crore on loans extended last year, going up to Rs 7,000 crore by 2006-07,"" he said.

""Currently, the interest rates on crop loans by banks work out to as high as 16-18 per cent,"" the FM said. Cooperative banks too lend at around 16-18 per cent despite NABARD making refinance available at 6.25 per cent. The high rate is because NABARD now gives refinance to only state cooperative banks and not directly to cooperatives at the district level.

Observing that interest rates on loans for tractor or other agriculture equipment was much higher than that for passenger cars, the FM said: ""A consortium of banks led by SBI has been formed to negotiate with the manufacturers and dealers of tractors and other agri-equipment for the purpose of obtaining maximum possible discounts and concessions.""

The government intends to ensure that credit to the farmer for buying tractor is is available on same terms as the car loans being given by banks.

8,Haryana govt crticised for handling farmers agitation,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana government has come in for sharp criticism from the People''s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) for its handling of the agitation of farmers under the banner of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).

Citing instances of the harshness in the state government''s response to the agitation the ""interim report of a fact finding into police excesses on Farmers in Haryana,"" the report said the most significant form for suppressing the farmers has been the launching of criminal cases and arrests.

Mentioning the suppression of the BKU leadership by such means the report states that ""since the arrest of Nain, every new acting acting BKU chief has been targeted immediately after assuming office. First Fateh Singh was charged under section 124-A of the IPC (sedition) and arrested. The next pradhan, Palaram Goud was elected on April 30 2003. He was similarly charged and put in jail 13 days later. On May 27 Joginder Singh Mor was elected

Pradhan. He has also been charged under section 124-A and is currently evading arrest.""

In this context it cites the treatment meted to BKU leader Ghasi Ram Nain who is currently under detention. ""Over the years, each phase of struggle conducted by the BKU has led to the launching of a series of cases against him. In all there are 128 such cases instituted against Nain since 1992.""

""It is important to note that while extremely serious charges like sedition and attempt to murder were slapped against him, during this same period he was negotiating with the heads of Haryana government, meeting chief ministers and signing agreements with high powered government bodies,"" it adds.

The report mentions that it has not been possible to ascertain the exact number of people charged with sedition, but estimates range between 50 and 70 people, 11 of whom are currently in jail.

""Our talk with the Jind district collector was of no help. He initially denied that anyone was charged under sedition, though later he admitted that there might be ""a few."" Our investigation revealed that there are 30 such persons in the district. The number charged under this provision in Fatehabad and Kaithal districts are 17 and 22 respectively,"" the PUDR said.

The report also mentions that there is evidence of custodial torture against those arrested.

""The PUDR team saw the bruises and marks on the bodies of the torture victims. It is to be noted that some of the victims were of advanced age. The team met Nafe Singh, who despite being an old man of 75 was not spared from brutal beatings and was held immobile all night by manacles. When the team met Singh, he could barely walk or talk. Similar was the situation of the 65 year-old Balmat Singh. There were other similar cases as well,"" the

report said.

10,"Vaghela, Amarsinh promise peaceful 'bandh'","RAJKOT: Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Shankersinh Vaghela and leader of the Opposition in the state assembly Amarsinh Chaudhary said on Wednesday that the party''s agitation against the increase in power tariff for the farm sector and other issues would be non-violent.

The Congress leaders said at a press conference at the Circuit House here that though party workers would resort to a ''rasta roko'' agitation throughout the state, roads would not be blocked by putting up barricades.

The duo even promised that during the planned school and college ''bandhs'', precaution would be taken so that no stone-throwing incident takes place. The party has planned a statewide ''bandh'' in schools, colleges and courts on August 8.

The Congress leaders charged the BJP government with increasing the burden on farmers and not taking any step to provide remunerative prices for farm produce. It appears that the state government is hell-bent on introducing anti-farmer programmes, they added. Besides burning effigies, the party also plans to lock government offices.

The party''s statewide agitation will begin on July 21 in Gandhinagar and will be followed by Mehsana on July 23, Sabarkantha on July 25, Banaskantha on July 28 and in Kutch district on August 2. Chaudhary said that farmers will now have to pay 55 paise per unit of power instead of the 22 paise earlier. This, he said, is the highestever increase in power tariff in the state.

He alleged that the state government has not given its share of 30 per cent crop insurance amount to farmers whose crop of cereals failed.

Chaudhary said that the Modi government also increased the charges for irrigation water supplied through canals by a huge 500 per cent, and college and school fee by 300 per cent. He said that the BJP government even removed pipelines through which farmers drew water from reservoirs for irrigation.

Cong leaders to meet in Vadodara: Congress leaders from central and south Gujarat will meet in Vadodara on Friday to intensify the programme against increase in power tariff for farm sector, spokesmen of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee, Arvind Sanghvi and Girish Parmar said.

The meeting would be attended by GPCC president Shankersinh Vaghela and CLP leader Amarsinh Chaudhary besides district and city party functionaries.Congress workers from Kutch and Saurashtra met in Rajkot on Wednesday and decided to launch an agitation on the issue.

11,'Varisht' question terms of LIC policy,"VADODARA: Senior citizens of the city may have given an overwhelming response to the newly launched Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana of LIC, but many have already started questioning the terms and conditions of the policy.

Being a one-of-akind policy for the aged, many had pinned hopes on it but now wonder if the initiative will be sustained. ""We are unhappy with the ceiling on maximum monthly pension of Rs 2,000. Considering the inflation and the cost of living, it should have been at least Rs 5,000 per month. The interest rates are not adequate too.We already have the Post Office savings scheme, which offers 7.5 per cent interest. So ideally, it should have been 12 per cent,"" said Gujarat Senior Citizens'' Federation executive secretary Praful Desai.

Ishwar Patel, vice president of Age Care Federation, a parent organisation of 24 senior citizens'' associations, said, ""We have better options in Kisan Vikas Patra, Post Office and also private lending which fetch good interest rates. As the middle and lower middle classes have no liquid funds, blocking their lifetime earnings in a policy is not wise.""

However, the LIC has clarified that following feedback from the investors, a few parameters have been changed in the policy. ""Now, the scheme has been made more liquid. Investors can withdraw the entire amount of the purchase price (deposit) after 12 years,"" said K R Balasubramanian, manager (sales) of Vadodara division of LIC.

Meanwhile, the Vadodara division of LIC has recorded a sale of 102 policies on the very first day, with corpus fund amounting to Rs 2 crore.

12,"MCD, state govt get contempt notice","NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has issued contempt notices to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the directorate of education over a public interest litigation (PIL) highlighting the inadequate number of teachers in Delhi government and MCD-run schools.

The petition filed by Social Jurists, a group of lawyers, had stated that the Delhi government and the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) had failed to provide enough teachers to these schools.

Justice Vikramjit Sen issued notices after the respondents apparently failed to comply with an earlier high court order asking them to adhere to a time schedule for appointment of teachers. The court sought a reply on the notices before August 18.

In an order dated December 20, 2001, Justice Devender Gupta and Justice S K Kaul had laid down the time schedule for filling vacancies for year 2003 and onwards to ensure no teaching post was vacant on April 1, 2003 in case of Delhi government schools and on July 1, 2003 in case of MCD schools.

The petition said that for the past several years thousands of vacant posts had not been filled up. There are about 3,000 vacancies of primary teachers in the primary schools run by MCD and about 5,000 vacancies in Delhi government-run schools.

The petition alleged that the Delhi government and MCDâ€™s failure to provide adequate number of teachers was adversely affecting the education of over 21 lakh students studying in these schools. The petitioners had stated that the fundamental right to education was being violated.

The petitioner submitted that the deadlines for ensuring that all vacancies were filled up had already expired on April 1, 2003, in case of government schools and on July 1, 2003, in case of MCD schools.

14,Vigilence Bureau feels pinch of expansion,"CHANDIGARH: The Vigilance Bureau (VB) might be giving sleepless nights to a large number of politicians and officials in Punjab, but it is the finance department that has in turn unnerved the VB.

While chief director A P Pandey has been among 400-odd VB officials whose salaries were put on hold temporarily this month for want of approval from the finance department, a fresh notice has been served on the department saying that 110-odd officials of the VB would not be paid salary after July 15 for they were not working at places from where their salaries are drawn.

The matter is likely to be referred to chief minister Amarinder Singh for sparing the VB of the rod wielded by the finance department.

The problem has cropped up as the number of staff swelled recklessly during the past one and a half years, ever since Amarinder Singh took over, without obtaining proper sanction for the posts from the finance department.

As against the sanctioned strength of 45 officials, the VB has engaged more than 500 officials.

While the posts of 400-odd staff, including that of the chief director, are approved every year by the finance department, more than 110 officials are employed in the VB even as they draw their salaries fromother places in the police department. The staff on the VB incidentally has been on deputation from the police department.

The expansion in the VB set-up intensified lately with large scale increase in the number of posts at various levels. Besides adding the post of the chief director, the VB has added two DIGs and as many as eight new SPs at the top in addition to large number of staff at the lower rung.

Five new VB police stations were created lately in the state while the strength of the flying squad and the economic offences'' wing beefed up considerably.

However, the finance department has taken it all as an anomalous growth of the prime department and has threatened to deprive the staff of their salaries.
