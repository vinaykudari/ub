0,Tripathi's cousin arrested in Madhumita case,"NEW DELHI: The CBI on Thursday arrested two people, including cousin of former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi, in connection with the Madhumita Shukla murder

case.

Santosh Rai and Rohit Chaturvedi were arrested in Lucknow by the agency sleuths. While Rai is a small-time political leader, Chaturvedi is Tripathiâ€™s cousin. The arrests were an important development in solving the murder mystery, sources said.

Tripathi had been arrested by the CBI in September in connection with the murder of 24-year-old Madhumita, who was shot dead at her Paper Mill Colony residence by two assailants on May 9 this year.

The murder had created a political furore in Uttar Pradesh leading to sacking of Tripathi from the Mayawati-led UP government. The case was later handed over to the CBI for thorough probe.

1,No more long waits for election results,"HYDERABAD: The Assembly elections, if advanced to February next year, promises candidates at least one thing â€” that they need not wait with bated breath for the outcome as the results will be ready at the click of a button.

The Election Commission (EC) has supplied about 60,000 electronic voting machines (EVMs) to Andhra Pradesh, equivalent to number of polling stations in the state. The commission might require another 10,000 machines as a buffer if it plans to go in for 100 per cent electronic voting in the state. The additional stock is likely to be borrowed from neighbouring states.

The EVMs will enable election officials to announce the results in a couple of hours, doing away with the cumbersome process of bundling and counting ballot papers.

If polls are held after January 20, about 2 per cent of voters will be first-time voters. This is because the EC wants to complete the summary revision of the electoral rolls by then.

The commission has chalked out an elaborate programme to revise the rolls, and the process will begin on November 17, chief electoral officer (CEO) M Narayana Rao told reporters at his office on Thursday. The draft rolls will be published in the gram sabhas, where officials will receive applications for inclusion, deletion and changes in the names.

The CEO said registration as a voter is not mandatory, but inclusion of the personâ€™s name in the electoral rolls is a must to exercise franchise.

2,SP 'ensures' victory in Parishad polls,"LUCKNOW: By nominating his own men to 2,251 posts in various local bodies, Samajwadi Party president and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has apparently ensured a fool-proof victory for his party candidates in the Vidhan Parishad local bodies polls scheduled for December 1.

The deft move, which even took his opponents by surprise, with the BJP crying foul over the manner in which the sitting members (1,251 belonged to it) were unceremoniously removed, has left the SP unfazed.

All talks of violation of the model code of conduct were brushed aside by agriculture minister and SP general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav with the observation that the ''questionable'' exercise had violated no such code of conduct.

In response to a specific query on the issue, Yadav said that the code of conduct came into existence once the notification was issued and, in this case, the same was yet to be done.

Hence, there was nothing wrong in the existing nominated members being replaced by new ones. Chief electoral officer Vijay Sharma, when asked about the violation, said the model code of conduct did not come into force in the Vidhan Parishad polls.

Confident that the scales were weighed heavily in the SP''s favour but ensuring that nothing was left to chance, the new nominated members were administered the oath of office on Thursday.

Each nagar nigam has 10, nagar palika 5 and nagar panchayat 3 nominated members. The change in the voters'' list is also expected to take place soon.

These nominated members along with the MLAs, MPs, gram pradhans, block pramukhs, zila panchayat chairman and members, nagar palika and nagar panchayat chairman, nagar pramukhs and corporators elect the Vidhan Parishad local bodies MLCs.

A total of 36 such MLCs are due to retire on January 15 2004. The Election Commission has already announced the schedule for these polls, the notification for which will be issued on Friday. The nominations will also begin the same day.

With roughly 1.13 lakh voters expected to exercise their right of franchise, around 40 to 70 votes will be affected on each seat following the new nominations.

For the SP, which already holds 12 of the 36 seats, the vital issue now is appeasing its two main allies, the Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Rashtriya Kranti Party, in seat allotment.

While the RKP is reportedly demanding 8 seats the RLD wants 7. The SP, according to sources, is in no mood to give beyond 2 or 3 to each.

Talks on seat allotment are currently under way with the SP likely to release the list of its candidates in a couple of days.

3,Bengal fails to arrest school dropout,"KOLKATA:West Bengal''s reputation as a centre of education has gone for a toss if school dropout rates are anything to go by.

From 22 per cent in 2001 to 31 per cent in 2003, the dropout rate in state schools, at the plus-two level, has simply gone up. Yet, no action plan is in place to contain the trend.

A total of 3,27,469 candidates passed the Madhyamik examination in 1999, but only 2,66,397 enrolled for the Higher Secondary Examination in 2001 (dropout 22.9 per cent). The following year, 3,46,913 candidates passed Madhyamik, but only 2,70,503 candidates enrolled for HS in 2002 (dropout 28.2 per cent).

The figures for the next corresponding batches were 3,56,199 and 2,71,036 respectively (dropout 31.4 per cent).

â€œI admit that the dropout rate is high, but I donâ€™t think it is the highest in the country. The scene is worse in states like Bihar and UP,â€� said West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education president Jyotirmoy Mukhopadhyay. He also blamed the lack of a proper vocational education system in the state for this.

â€œWe were the first state to start the vocational stream at the plus-two level. But we received no support from the Centre or the state,â€� he added. Only 2,500 children on an average enrol for the Councilâ€™s vocational courses in agriculture, technical training and trade and commerce.

The Council has just sent a report on the dismal state of vocational education at the plus-two level to the state school education department and requested it to set up a statutory body to take it over from the Council.

It has also sent a request to the vocational education cell of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for financial assistance.

Owing to the socio-economic conditions, after studying up to class X, children were often sent to work to earn a living, Mukhopadhyay lamented. School education secretary T.K. Bose said, â€œThe state has not devised any policy to contain dropouts because the responsibility lies with the Madhyamik Board and HS Council, which are autonomous.â€�

Educationist Sunando Sanyal criticised the official attitude, saying, â€œThere is no reason to blame parents, because studies have shown that parents are eager to send their children to school. But look at the dichotomy â€” there are 52,000 primary schools but only 10,000 secondary schools and less than that which have HS sections.

Moreover, look at the vast difference in Madhyamik and HS syllabi. It is clear that the state does not want all its children who complete Madhyamik to go in for HS.â€�

4,PW threat forces govt to up security for Bandaru,"HYDERABAD: Amidst reports that the Peopleâ€™s War is planning to kill Union urban development minister Bandaru Dattatreya, the state government has increased his security cover in Andhra Pradesh.

Dattatreya is currently in the Y security category, which entiles him to two personal security officers. As a Union minister, an escort is provided to him during his visits to the state.

Informed sources said the intelligence wing has been asked to ascertain the threat perception to Dattatreya and, if necessary, upgrade him to Z category.

Siraj alias Azad, a renegade naxalite captured by the Peopleâ€™s War while allegedly attempting to kill his comrades, claimed a couple of days ago that he had recced the Union ministerâ€™s house in Hyderabad at the behest of the PW leadership.

Siraj also claimed that he was an agent of the police and that he had informed some senior officials of the Peopleâ€™s War plot.

The BJP has taken the revelation seriously and demanded a probe to find out why the police did step up security to Dattatreya despite knowing of the plot.

Its state general secretary G Kishen Reddy said at a press conference, â€œThe police negligence is unpardonable because Dattatreya meets people without any security.â€�

Reacting to Sirajâ€™s confession, the government has asked the police department to enhance Dattatreyaâ€™s security cover. Dattatreya will be given a bullet-proof car and more security officers.

5,19 charred in tea garden violence,"KOLKATA: Nineteen persons were killed in carnage on Thursday morning when tea garden workers vented their fury on a corrupt Citu leader and his henchmen.

The villain: garden leader Tarakeswar Lohar. The defiants: garden workers belonging to the same union. The police arrested 106 workers, including 25 women. The incident occurred at the Dalgaon Tea Estate under the Birpara II gram panchayat, a few kilometres from Jalpaiguri.

Around 8.00 am, garden workers mobbed Loharâ€™s house asking him why he was leasing out the badli jobs to outsiders while their families suffered.

They barged into his house, dragging out some of his henchmen who were holding a meeting. Some of the henchmen were hacked to death. Loharâ€™s bodyguard then opened fire at the mob, injuring 20-year-old student Sanik Katia. This was enough for the workers to hurl bombs at the house. The gas cylinder inside exploded and the house went up in flames.

All the workers had wanted was to get back their claim over the garden jobs that Lohar had been denying for long in collusion with some garden officials.

â€œThe workers were protesting Loharâ€™s attempts to supply outside labour against payment. Recently, about 70 vacancies were created at the garden. With most Dooars gardens in poor shape, such employment opportunities were rare and Lohar was making the most of it,â€� sources said.

Inder Hulani, company secretary of RNT Plantations, which owns the estate, said intra-union rivalry led to the tragedy.

The carnage was the worst-ever in the Dooars. A decade ago, a few workers died in a similar rivalry at Batabari Estate after being shot with poisonous arrows. The tea industry reacted with shock. â€œ cannot recall such a violent incident,â€� Indian Tea Association chairman C.K. Dhanuka said.

Though the incident took ITA and Tea Association of India officials by surprise, as most disputes are over wage arrears and involve the management, industry observers said a blow-up within labour ranks was imminent.

â€œTraditionally, badli workers are taken from the families living in the gardens. In the past year-and-a-half though, Citu and Intuc leaders have been roping in outside workers, causing resentment in the gardens,â€� they said, adding that Lohar had earned the workersâ€™ wrath despite belonging to the same Citu-affiliated Cha Bagan Mazdoor Union.

6,"Lift suspension or face strike, docs warn govt","KOLKATA: Junior doctors from all over the state decided to go on hunger strike on Friday, protesting against the suspension notice served on four interns of RG Kar Medical College on Thursday.

They even threatened an indefinite ceasework if the order was not withdrawn. The decision was taken at a late night meeting.

Earlier in the day, the health department, in a bid to pre-empt recurrence of the RG Kar fiasco, issued a fiat to the hospitals to either treat or transfer patients.

The health mandarins also wanted the college authorities to punish the interns. The Calcutta University, to which the college is affiliated, is yet to put its seal on the suspension though.

There was a low turnout of patients at the outdoor departments of state hospitals on Thursday. Officials took care that even those who came for treatment did not loiter around.

The treat-or-transfer mantra had immediate effect.

When a patient at the Calcutta Medical College ENT department was told in the afternoon the operation theatre was closed and he could not be admitted, doctors took it upon themselves to see he left the hospital at once.

â€œWe do not want to give them any time to stay here and create a ruckus. It is better that they go to another hospital,â€� a doctor said.

Even as the majority of junior doctors went on strike, those belonging to the CPMâ€™s medical wing vented their frustration against the media which they saw as the root of all evil.

Members of the Association of Health Services Doctors tried to prevent RG Kar students from meeting journalists at the hospital gate.

Merely 25 per cent of the junior doctors reported for duty. Out-patient departments suffered the most as senior doctors were summoned for crisis management in the wards.

Only two of the six junior doctors were present at the medicine outdoor of Calcutta Medical College. â€œMost of the junior doctors did not turn up, so senior doctors were summoned to control the situation. There was no problem,â€� said CMCH deputy superintendent A.N. Biswas.

7,"Stop wasting water, minister tells city","PUNE: State minister for rural development R R Patil on Thursday said irresponsible use of water in urban areas and industries should be checked as a long-term solution to combat scarcity and drought.

In an indirect reference to the excessive use of water in Pune and the fierce opposition to diverting 12 TMC water to drought-affected areas from the city, Patil asked why some people could not manage with 150 litres of water per head a day.

â€œIn a city like New York, every person gets only 95 litres of water. Why canâ€™t some people make do with 150 litres of water per head?â€� he wondered.

Patil was speaking at a function organised to hand over the Rs 2.01 lakh collected by the Pune Union of Working Journalists for the drought-affected areas in Pune to the Pune zilla parishad.

Minister of state for agriculture Dada Jadhavrao, Khed MP Ashok Mohol, ZP president Devram Lande and chief executive officer Rajendra Chavan were present. Referring to the Pune municipal corporationâ€™s failure in treating and releasing 6 TMC water for irrigation, Patil pointed out that 1 TMC water could irrigate 10,000 acres of land and provide employment to 10,000 people.

The minister said rainwater should be harvested and used for sanitation, watering gardens and washing vehicles in cities.

Patil blamed the industry for ruthless and irresponsible exploitation water, failure in treating effluents and ruining rivers by releasing untreated effluents.

â€œThe Patalganga belt in Raigad district has been ruined because of this,â€� he said. About the scarcity situation in the state, Patil said there had not been single day in the past 10 years when tanker had not been pressed into service in some part of the state. â€œ present, 1,624 tankers have been pressed into service to supply water to 5,130 villages and colonies. People in 27,000 colonies are not getting even 20 litres of water per head,â€� he remarked.

Khed MP Ashok Mohol urged Puneites to accept water cuts so that people in nearby villages could get drinking water.

â€œIn fact, Puneites should pay more attention to conserving water than opposing water cuts,â€� he remarked.

Zilla parishad chief executive officer Rajendra Chavan said the PUWJâ€™s financial aid would utilised to fit wheels on wells to help draw water.

A part of the money would also be utilised for giving hydro-fracture treatment to 600 borewells that have gone dry in the district, he said.

9,Good ol' coffee goes upmarket,"LUCKNOW: You''d probably fail to acknowledge its existence in your tearing hurry to get to it''s hip, upmarket cousin located right next door, but what it lacks in style, it makes up for in substance, tradition and history.

Started in 1938 the Coffee House can boast of an enchanting history - one in which, political moves and developments were dissected over cups of steaming hot coffee. Coffee then, went best with an intellectual debate topped with the whipped fervour of a literary conference.

Coffee today, for Yogesh Karar who sits sipping his mocha in the hip environs of Cafe Coffee Day, begins and ends with Barista and CCD. The Indian Coffee House is a name completely alien to him. And yes, he''s certainly not new to the City of Nawabs.

There was a time when the Indian Coffee House was almost a part of Indian politics, recounts R K Singh, the president of India Coffee Workers'' Co-operative Society Ltd. But today, if any political figure does come to the coffee shop, it''s only because of it''s historical importance.

It''s another matter of course, that the coffee at Coffee House is far cheaper than that at any of it''s hip cousins.

The most expensive coffee at the Indian Coffee House is half the price of the cheapest coffee at the other trendier coffee shops. But then again, price is not a consideration for the hip, young and upwardly mobile.

Prof Shiva Mohan, a freedom fighter, who has been visiting Indian Coffee House for more than 50 years now, plunges into nostalgia as he talks about it.

""It has been a wonderful place,"" he sighs, as he recounts the conversations that he used to have with the likes of the former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, over a cup of coffee.

Meanwhile, Afshan Anjum (16), a student of Emma Thomas College, says she wouldn''t like to go the to the Indian Coffee House simply because ""no one else does"". Divya Kesarwani (15) agrees with Afshan, and feels quite at home at CCD, even though she''s there for the first time.

And not surprisingly, the Indian Coffee House has registered a fall in sales of about 20 per cent. And forced to pull up its socks and face the competition, RK Singh reveals, that the Indian Coffee House is going to have some serious remodelling of its own.

10,HC asks govt to withhold transfers,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka High Court on Thursday directed the state government to withhold the transfers of police and other department officers, effected on October 29, 2003, till the election process to the local bodies is over.

Justice H. Rangavitalachar passed the directions after the government counsel consulted the deputy inspector-general (administration) and deputy secretary, Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR), and submitted that the state would give an undertaking not to transfer the officers required for the election duty.

IPS officers, deputy superintendents of police (DySPs) and police inspectors were included in the 126 transfers effected in the police department. The controversial transfer of Hassan SP Nanjundswamy too was one of them.

The State Election Commission (SEC) had filed an election petition, contending that the state had notified the transfers in violation of the Code of Conduct, effective from October 13 to November 12, 2003.

One of the submissions made before the court was that the police force was needed for maintenace of law and order, which was part of the election duty. The transfers were highly improper and struck at the very root of having free and fair elections, the petition contended.

On October 30, the SEC had directed the state to stay the transfers in view of the forthcoming elections to local bodies. But the state had not replied.

The petitioner contended that the state had erred in effecting the transfers in violation of a circular issued by the government itself on October 21, 2003.

The petitioner submitted that the transfers amounted to infringing on the EC''s powers. The state had failed to observe that the EC did not have an independent machinery to conduct elections and took the assistance of officers and other state government staff.

The petitioner sought from the court to withhold the transfers effected by the state till the election process was complete.

With the High Court directing the state government on Thursday to withhold transfer of 126 police officials and revenue officers in view of elections to local bodies, the officials will continue to serve in their respective postings.

""The government has already submitted to the court that the officials will not be transferred till elections are completed. The court has taken cognisance of it,"" chief secretary B.S. Patil told The Times of India here.

State DGP T. Madiyal stated that the government had to comply with the HC order. ""The officers transferred will be retained in the same posts,"" he added.

13,Two arrested in Madhumita case remanded,"

LUCKNOW: A CBI court today sent Rohit Chaturvedi, one of two persons arrested yesterday in connection with the Madhumita Shukla murder case, to police custody till November 19, while the other - Santosh Rai - was remanded to judicial custody till November 21.

After his police custody, Chaturvedi would also be sent to judicial custody till November 21.

Special Judicial Magistrate (CBI) R M Yadav also allowed CBI''s application for transferring Rai to the Barabanki district jail.

CBI pleaded that since another accused in the case, former state minister Amar Mani Tripathi was currently lodged in Lucknow district jail, it would not be advisable to keep Rai in the same prison.

The court also directed CBI to intimate the counsels for the defence in case it takes Chaturvedi, who is the first cousin of Tripathi, out of Lucknow for interrogation.

Two lawyers representing Chaturvedi would be present during his interrogation at a distance but would not interfere in any way in the interrogation, the court ordered.

Earlier, the CBI counsel pleaded in the court that police remand of Chaturvedi was required for the purpose of further investigation in the case.

CBI did not seek police remand of Rai alias ''Neta'' alias Satyaprakash, as he was yet to be identified, the CBI counsel submitted in the court. Rai is a small-time political leader.

The 24-year-old poetess Madhumita was shot dead at her Paper Mill Colony residence here by two assailants on May nine this year.

15,Kashiram inaugurates meet on watershed development,"AHMEDABAD: Union rural development minister Kashiram Rana said on Friday that the prime ministerâ€™s Rs 1,000-crore â€˜Gram Jal Samrakshan Yojnaâ€™ for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to implement watershed development projects is likely to be launched soon.

Inaugurating a two-day national workshop on â€˜Best practices in watershed developmentâ€™ here, Rana said that over 163 lakh hectares of land have been covered under different projects during the last eight years.

â€œYet the impression is that nothing is being done,â€� he regretted.

Emphasising on the need for water conservation, the minister urged state agencies to implement the target of providing drinking water facilities to â€˜nosourceâ€™ villages through low-cost watershed development programmes by 2004.

Claiming that 99 per cent of villages have been covered by drinking water network, the minister said that of the 14 lakh human habitats in hilly, forested and remote areas, an estimated 1.10 lakh of them are without any drinking water facility.

Rana said that the central budgetary allocation under the department of land resources has been increased from Rs 263 crore in 1999-2000 to Rs 1,050 crore in 2003-04.

16,India to kick start HIV vaccine development next year,"VADODARA: If South Africa tops the list of countries with 4.5 million HIV positive people, India is right at its heels, coming in second, with four million HIV cases.

But when it comes to developing vaccines among the developing countries, it is Thailand, Brazil and Uganda, who take the lead. In the wake of the global emergency declared by the US, India has taken the plunge in developing preventive vaccines.

â€œUnder the prime ministerâ€™s initiative programme, a chain of research units in India would join hands to develop vaccine for the subtype C, which is prevalent in India. The project will begin in May 2004,â€� R Gangakhedkar, assistant director of the National Aids Research Institute (NARI), Pune, one of the institutes to be involved in the vaccine development programme said.

The other reputed institutes include NIV, NICED, AIIMS, IISC and NCCS. Addressing the three-day national conference of the Indian Association for the study of STD and AIDS held in Vadodara on Friday, Gangakhedkar said, â€œThe virus causing AIDS has global variations or sub types â€” America and Europe have â€˜Bâ€™ type, while Asia and Australia have â€˜Câ€™, â€˜eâ€™ and â€˜bâ€™ types. This compels India to develop its own vaccine as we cannot benefit from the vaccines developed in the West.â€�

Vaccine development is a tough task, admits Gangakhedkar. â€œWe cannot bank on the assistance of the developed countries as they would target diseases endemic to their regions and in this case address subtypes prevalent in their region.

Second, it is difficult to produce vaccine for HIV as the genomic sequence of the virus is error- prone and has a tendency to change its form each time it multiples,â€� he says.

Elaborating on the clinical trials that will be carried out in the region, which will focus on preventive, therapeutic and perinatal vaccines, Gangakhedkar said, â€œAs drug trials on animals have been considerably successful, we need to conduct human trials. For this, we have a three-phase investigation where safety of the drug, immunogenecity (ability to boost immunity response) and the efficacy (effectiveness) will tested before the vaccine is finally approved.â€�

â€œWe intend to rope in doctors, NGOs, media and other outreach workers to create awareness among people about AIDS prevention and also the need to extend co-operation for clinical trials,â€� says Gangakhedkar, pointing at the hindering factors like ethical, legal and social implications of the research.

17,CBI arrests man for duping NRI,"NEW DELHI: Dreams of an Ireland-based non-resident Indian (NRI) to invest in his motherland seem to have gone sour. A Chennai-based middleman allegedly cheated Mukesh Kumar of about Rs 70 crore by issuing forged fixed deposit receipts (FDR) of two banks, the State Bank of India (SBI) and the Federal Bank.

J K Fernandes, the middleman, was arrested by the CBI and brought to Delhi on Friday. He will remain in CBIâ€™s custody for five days.

The CBI are also probing the role of bank officials. Kumar runs a supermarket in Ireland and had complained to the CBI a month ago.

â€˜â€˜Kumar met Fernandes in Chennai. The latter promised him great returns if the money was invested in SBI and the Federal Bank there. Sixteen FDRs of SBI and two of Federal Bank were issued in Kumarâ€™s nameâ€™â€™.

Kumarâ€™s father, living in Delhi, got suspicious when he did not get any response from bank officials to his queries which were sent after he learnt that somebody was availing loans against the investment.

When Kumarâ€™s father sent a legal notice to the banks, Fernandes replied and promised to pay the money. The complainant was in for a further jolt when he learnt the drafts, allegedly issued by Fernandes, were fake.

Later, speaking to reporters, he brushed aside comments that Modi was the face of Hindutva.

â€˜â€˜There are hundreds of guiding forces for Hindus. I do not think Hindus need anybody to guide them in this modern era,â€™â€™ he contended.

On whether BJP would repeat the â€˜Gujarat experimentâ€™ in other states, Modi remarked: â€˜â€˜Election strategies are never meant to be revealed.â€™â€™
