0,Education and medical care must for development: Shastri,"LUCKNOW: It will require a range of efforts in every field to actually proceed towards development.

Each of these efforts individually must have synergy among the parties concerned and collectively there must be coherence among all the efforts, this is what ''coherent energy'' is all about.

For India to go forward rapidly, there is a need for coherent energy in all efforts, according to Dr R Chidambaram, principal scientific advisor to the Government of India and DAE-Homi Bhabha professor, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai at the 8th convocation ceremony of Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) on Tuesday.

Governor Vishnukant Shastri, while appreciating the standard of SGPGI, said that education and medical care were the two pointers of development and the country should be striving towards development, instead of maintaining its position as a developing one.

Dr Chidambaram said that the two most important measures of development in a developing country were ''per capita electricity'' consumption and ''female literacy'', adding that it could be shown that the per capita electricity also strongly influenced health parameters, viz, life expectancy at birth, and when female literacy was high, both the infant mortality rate and the birth rate went down. ""More availability of electricity means better drinking water, sewage facilities and primary health care in small towns and in rural areas.""

Mahendra Bhandari, director SGPGI, said the departments of cardio-vascular, thoracic surgery and bone marrow transplant were jointly working towards achieving stem cell transplant in patients with heart failure who could not be treated today without a heart transplant. ""This will be first effort of its kind in India.""

The institute is also working towards establishing a ''digital library'', which will provide all the scientific information available at national and international level online.

Dr Bhandari announced that the department of haematology, integrating clinical haematology and laboratory haematology would become functional this year, which would help the patients of blood cancer and fatal blood disorders.

At the convocation 15 DM degrees, eight MCh degrees, seven MD degrees, eight PHd degrees and 11 post-doctoral certificates were awarded.

1,Apathy holds up laws to empower women,"NEW DELHI: More than a year after a task force recommended a series of amendments to several laws relating to women, the government seems to be showing scant interest in implementing the suggestions.

The task force, headed by Planning Commission deputy chairman K C Pant, had reviewed 22 laws in 2001, which was observed as the womenâ€™s empowerment year. Among the laws taken up for scrutiny were labour laws on minimum wages, maternity benefits, equal remuneration and others on dowry, sati, family courts and indecent representation of women.

HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi recently wrote to the ministries and departments concerned asking them to give priority to this matter and initiate the process for amending the laws at the earliest. As the other ministries had shown little interest, the department of women and child development (DWCD) has convened an inter-ministerial meeting on January 24.

DWCD officials said their role was limited as most of the laws reviewed by the task force were under the purview of other ministries, which could only be persuaded to take up this matter seriously.

But the DWCD itself has been slow in acting on the amendments recommended in the laws concerning the department. DWCD officials said the Centre is in the process of consulting the state governments about the suggested changes in the laws on sati and dowry. They said Joshi has written to all chief ministers to elicit their views on the matter. However, they are quick to add that the DWCD had taken the initiative in drafting a law on domestic violence, the first of its kind.

As for the law on indecent representation of women, the HRD ministry has asked the National Law School for its comments, specifically asking for a comparative definition of what constitutes â€˜â€˜indecent representationâ€™â€™ in the laws in other countries.

2,Pak to push for changes in US immigration law,"WASHINGTON: Thousands of Pakistani men in the United States are holding back from registering themselves under a controversial identification scheme that requires them to be fingerprinted and photographed, hoping that the government in Islamabad will cash in its frontline ally status to bail them out.Reports from community and immigration activists across the US suggest very few Pakistanis are reporting for fingerprinting and photographing process that began on Monday and is scheduled to end on February 21.The buzz in the community is that Pakistanâ€™s Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri, who has advanced his visit to the US from January 29 to this weekend, will persuade US to drop Pakistan from the targeted list.In announcing the advancement of his US visit, Kasuri told reporters in Islamabad that the issue will be on top of the agenda when he meets US officials and that he will seek special treatment for Pakistanis in the US.Some estimates say there are anywhere between 20,000 to 50,000 Pakistanis in the US who are in visa violation and who could be deported if the rules are strictly implemented.Thus far there is no indication that the US, especially the immigration and homeland security authorities, are inclined to show any special consideration to Pakistan. Arguments about Pakistanâ€™s frontline status in the war on terrorism is met with the counter that in almost every major terrorist act in the past decade, including the killing of CIA personnel, the World Trade Center blasts, the embassy bombings in Africa among other incidents, the perpetrators emerged from Pakistan and returned there to take shelter.In effect, innocent Pakistanis, including many brilliant students and skilled professional workers who come here under the J1 and H1-B visa programme like their Indian counterparts, are having to pay for the increasingly jehadi atmosphere engendered by military-controlled Pakistani governments.Under the new immigration regulations, men above 16 from 20 Islamic countries who are not permanent US residents, green card holders or diplomats are required to register under the rules that many activists say unfairly targets young Muslim males. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are the last two, and the most prominent countries, that have been called to comply with the new rules.While the Saudi men are only in the few hundreds, Pakistanis are a thriving community numbers tens of thousands working on a range of both blue collar and white collar jobs. Passport and visa violations, mostly from overstaying, are said to be rampant among the blue-collar types.Kasuri is expected to argue that deporting Pakistani aliens, even if they are in visa violation, will aggravate the anti-US mood that the military dispensation often uses as a bargaining chip.In seeking that they be granted an amnesty, Pakistani officials are also expected to make the economic arguments that remittances to the country will be affected.Kasuriâ€™s also has other troublesome issues to deal with on his visit. Among them is the scandal involving diplomat Munir Akram, Pakistanâ€™s permanent representative to the UN, who is in a jam after allegedly bashing up his Croatian girlfriend.At the insistence of New York law enforcement authorities, the state department has asked Pakistan to withdraw his diplomatic immunity to enable his prosecution. Pakistan is yet to respond to the demand.Pakistani nationalists have been seeing dark conspiracies in the case, including hidden Indian, Israeli and US hand, aimed at destroying the career of a man they say has brilliantly defended Pakistani interests in the arms control and disarmament debates.Related story:",WASHINGTON
3,Mufti tells ministers to focus on governance,"JAMMU: A day after expanding his coalition government in Jammu and Kashimr, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Wednesday tried to calm the ones left out saying they were ""equal partners"" in the government.

""It is not necessary that one has to be a minister to serve the people,"" he said, adding those who could not be inducted into the ministry were also ""competent persons"" and they ""are equal partners in the government.""

They, too, had to work in unison to implement the government''s collective agenda and serve the people to bring down their difficulties, Sayeed said addressing a meeting of his council of ministers here.

Asking all the ministers and legislators to declare their assets, Sayeed said that his government faced a formidable task of bringing about a discernible change in the system through good governance and transparent and accountable administration.

""Today even our enemy is taking us more seriously as they feel that we can succeed in giving a turnaround to the situation. This makes the task more challenging and we should face it with determination and fortitude to deliver more effectively,"" he said appealing to his ministers to focus attention on the poorest of the poor.

4,AICC team meets party MLAs in Maharashtra,"MUMBAI: A three-member AICC team on Wednesday consulted party MLAs in Maharashtra here on a possible successor to Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh whose exit now appeared almost a certainty.

The AICC team, comprising senior leaders Vayalar Ravi, Pranab Mukherjee and Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke to state Congress MLAs, members of the legislative council and state office-bearers region-wise at a government guest house about the possible move to replace Deshmukh.

Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha Shivraj Patil was also present at the place where the consultations were held.

Ahead of the exercise undertaken by the observers, Deshmukh met party MLAs at his official residence ''Varsha'' Wednesday morning, apparently to muster support.

Ranjit Deshmukh, a known critic of the Chief Minister, told reporters that the party MLAs were not too happy with the functioning.

Shivraj Patil described the Congress meeting as a ""routine mid-term assessment of the government"" which would also envisage ways to meet new challenges before the party.

He said though the state government has done a ""good job, we have to improve our performance.""

Asked whether he was in the race for chief ministership, Patil said ""I work in Delhi and I am one MP who has never tried to come back to Maharashtra"".

5,"Suzuki, disinvestment ministry to meet on Maruti IPO in Feb","NEW DELHI: In a bid to accelerate the process of public offer in auto giant Maruti Udyog (MUL), officials of disinvestment ministry and Suzuki Motor Corporation on Wednesday met merchant bankers and are understood to have decided to file the prospectus before market regulator Sebi by next month.

SMC and ministry officials, representing the two sides in the joint venture, also decided to meet on a weekly basis to ensure that public issue for divestment of government''s 25 per cent of the 45 per cent equity was completed by March 2003.

Immediately after emerging from the meeting SMC representative and Director Marketing and Sales in MUL K Saito said ""we had a good meeting and we (SMC) are totally cooperating."" He, however, declined to comment on the target for completion of IPO through book building route.

Asked if they had come for discussion and finalisation of prospectus for the public issue, another SMC representative S Nakanishi, accompanied by MUL Managing Director Jagdeesh Khattar, said ""yes... something of that kind.""

Disinvestment Secretary Pradeep Baijal, who along with Heavy Industry Secretary Naresh Narad was representing government during the meeting with investor bankers, said ""we have decided to meet on a weekly basis to monitor the progress. We will strive to complete the public issue by targeted March 31.""

It was also decided during the meeting that MUL would provide all the information including balance sheets and other relevant financial details to merchant bankers for finalisation of prospectus in the next few weeks, sources said.

The disinvestment ministry is also understood to have decided on appointment of Crawford & Bailey as the domestic legal advisor for the public offer.

Along with the legal advisor the merchant bankers for the IPO â€” ICICI Securities, Kotak Mahindra and HS - will report the progress on IPO every Tuesday to disinvestment ministry and SMC in the weekly monitoring meeting, sources said.

A participant of the meeting said that there would be no requirement for the International Accounting Standard (GAAP) for the proposed issue that is being dubbed as a major domestic IPO on international platform.

As part of its disinvestment programme, the government had ceded majority control in MUL earlier during the current fiscal by not participating in a rights issue for consideration of control and renunciation premium.

The public issue was the second stage of disinvestment in MUL where the joint venture partner SMC had agreed to give an underwriting of Rs 2300 a share as part of the agreement and government had decided to offer 25 per cent equity by March, 2003 through an IPO and the remaining is to be sold by the next financial year.
