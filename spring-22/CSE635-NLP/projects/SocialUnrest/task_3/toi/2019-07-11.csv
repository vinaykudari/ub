0,I'm being victimised for opposing CM: Ex-minister Kushwaha,"LUCKNOW: The former minister of state for forest Dr Ram Asrey Singh Kushwaha, against whom a corruption case has been registered in Bahraich, pleaded innocence, saying he was being falsely implicated due to political reasons.

""I am being targeted for raising a banner of revolt against Mayawati,"" he said while talking to TNN over phone from Haryana. Dr Kushwaha said he would file a case for quashing the FIR lodged against him to seek justice.

""The FIR is politically-motivated and nothing but Mayawatiâ€™s vendetta against me for revolting against her leadership. I was given a clean chit by the Rajnath government on the Lokayukta report,"" he claimed.

Dr Kushwaha said that there was not an iota of truth in complaint lodged against him by the Bahraich-based kattha factory owner Rajendra Maheswari. ""A minister has a right to inspect any factory involved in shady business. His charge that I had demanded Rs two lakh from him through my information officer is false as a minister of state is not entitled to have a PRO or IO,"" he pointed out.

1,HC fines govt for delay in filing counter-affidavit,"LUCKNOW: The high court here on Monday took a serious note of not filing the response in a service matter, pending since 1994, and imposed Rs 5000 as cost, which will be paid from the state exchequer. The court further held that it was open to the state government to fix responsibility on the official concerned for not filing the counter-affidavit despite several opportunities given by the court.

The orders were passed by a division bench, comprising Justice Jagdish Bhalla and Justice PK Chatterjee, on a writ petition filed by Pradeep Kumar Trivedi. The bench allowed three weeksâ€™ further time to file the counter-affidavit on the request of the state counsel in the interest of justice on payment of Rs 5000 as cost and provided one-week time to the petitioner to file rejoinder, if any. The court also observed that it would be open for the state to recover the cost of Rs 5,000 from the official concerned.

It was urged by the additional chief standing counsel that without the counter-affidavit of the state government, the clear picture will not come before the court. The hearing will resume on August 12 next.

Ayodhya case: The special full bench of the high court, comprising Justice Sudhir Narain, Justice SR Alam and Justice Bhanwar Singh, here on Tuesday recorded the statement of Dr SP Gupta, former director of the National Museums, in the title suits relating to Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri masjid.

3,Parents group splits over income-based fee issue,"PUNE: The Pune Parents Association (PPA), which has been resisting the proposed fee hike in government-aided English medium schools, has suffered a split.

The split faction, known as the G.K.H. Mandalâ€™s School Parents Association, took out a rally from the B.J. medical College ground on Wednesday, a day ahead of the PPAâ€™s programme in protest against the fee hike.

Over a hundred parents, accompanied by their wards in school uniforms, and displaying placards, blocked the road in front of the collectorâ€™s office for an hour. They later submitted a memorandum to senior officials of the state education department, the zilla parishad and Madhukar Kokate, the district collector.

While office bearers of the newly-floated G.K.H. Mandalâ€™s School Parents Association admitted to severing ties with PPA for â€œgoing extremely slowâ€� on pressuring the government to revoke its decision, the PPA said it was not bothered by the development. The new association has also roped in PPA members, including its public relations officer Vinesh Tanna, who is now the president.

According to Sudarshan Nair, the convenor of the PPA, a silent morcha will be taken out from the same venue in protest against the fee hike on Thursday as scheduled earlier. â€œWe are more interested in solving the vexed fee issue, and the fight will continue till the unjust and unfair decision is withdrawn totally,â€� he added.

Kamlesh Shah, the secretary of the new body, said that parents from some more schools have expressed their willingness to shift sides. â€œParents from the St. Miraâ€™s school, the G.K.H. Mandalâ€™s school in Convent Street and Dagaruram Kataria high school participated in Wednesdayâ€™s rally,â€� Shah said. Accusing certain PPA officebearers of fiefdom, Tanna pointed out to the several promises made earlier on seeking legal proceedings in the matter. â€œEverybody has been hearing that PPA is going to move the court, but nobody knows when,â€� he said.

He said that the future course of action would be decided after a couple of days. â€œThe district collector has given an assurance that some decision will be taken by the government in the next few days,â€� he said.

4,PMC flayed for manipulating ward polls,"PUNE: The Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat (ABGP) on Wednesday condemned the Pune municipal corporation for manipulating polls to divisional ward committees to accommodate political workers in the guise of nongovernment organisations.

The ABGP also announced that its activists will now keep a watch on the functioning of the PMC and challenge its wrongdoings. â€œMunicipal commissioner T.C. Benjamin should resign from his post for allowing and condoning the farce which made a mockery of the 74th amendment that stipulated representation to NGOs on divisional ward committees,â€� Bindumadhav Joshi, founder of ABGP, said.

Addressing a press conference to announce its social Chaturmas programme, Joshi said the ABGP would hold a debate on the style of PMCâ€™s functioning and its policies on September 7 during its fourmonth social awakening programme that commences from July 20. â€œWe will also challenge the PMCâ€™s decision to take affidavits from the merged villages that they will never approach the court against it,â€� Joshi remarked, adding, â€œitâ€™s time someone challenged the PMCâ€�.

Joshi told reporters that during the Chaturmas programme, new activists will be inducted into the ABGP. Elaborating on the various programmes chalked out by his organisation for the next four months, Joshi said 12 lectures had been arranged to educate consumer activists.

Former textile commissioner B.C. Khatua will speak on â€œtextiles and cheating of consumersâ€�, media expert Vijay Shah will give lecture on â€œMisleading advertisementsâ€�, Ayurved expert Balaji Tambe will deliberate on â€œAyurved, a way of life, while yogacharya B.K.S. Iyengar will give a lecture on â€œYogaâ€�.

Two open interviews will feature industrialists Abhay Firodia and Bhavarlala Jain on the theme â€œMy success and consumer welfareâ€�. A seminar on whether the government is public oriented will have speakers like former bureaucrat Avinash Dharmadhikari, water expert Madhav Chitale, inspector general of registration Dr Nitin Karir and commissioner of anti-corruption bureau Atulchandra Kulkarni.

The four-month programme will be inaugurated by Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi. Badminton player P. Gopichand will be felicitated on October 31 for refusing to endorse commercial products, Joshi added.

6,"ABVP, Left workers clash over Sahgal's remarks","MUMBAI: Activists of the pro-RSS Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad were involved in a minor scuffle with workers of Left parties outside the Mumbai Marathi Patrakar Sangh hall at Azad Maidan on Wednesday over Lakshmi Sahgalâ€™s remarks about freedomfighter V.D. Savarkar and Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee.

The police arrested 20 ABVP activists. Ms Sahgalâ€™s remarks about Savarkar and Mr Vajpayee appeared in some local dailies on Wednesday. Asked about the BJPâ€™s accusation that the communists have always betrayed India, she was quoted as saying, â€œYou mean the BJP will teach us about character. Savarkar, their greatest hero, sought a pardon from the British rulers and agreed to help them nab freedom-fighters. Their prime minister too, engaged in similar activities.â€™â€™

Defending her remarks at the press conference, Ms Sahgal said, â€œWhen people join a struggle, they should be prepared to face the consequences. Everyone knows how Savarkarâ€™s apology was used against the people of India.â€™â€™ Asked why she was with the leftists who had criticised a legendary freedom-fighter like Subhas Chandra Bose, she said the Left parties â€œrealised later that Bose was not a puppet in the hands of the Japanese but a true patriot.â€™â€™

Ms Sahgal alleged that the Sangh Parivar was attacking the foundations of Indian society through its communal propaganda. Revering to Gujarat, she said the atrocities there were no match for the cruelty the Japanese were accused of during World War II. â€œThey did not slash pregnant women and throw the fetuses into the fire.â€™â€™

7,CM to reconsider move on income-based fee,"MUMBAI: Parents and children from 172 schools held dharnas outside their respective schools on Wednesday morning before attending the rally organised by the PTA United Forum at Azad Maidan to protest against the governmentâ€™s decision to impose an income-based fee structure.

The protest started peacefully. However, when no government representative came to meet them at the maidan, they took their battle to the roads. Groups of students, from Class V to X, paraded banners and shouted slogans like â€œWe want justiceâ€™â€™ and â€œSpend money on education and not on MLA holidays abroadâ€™â€™ outside the BMC headquarters, only held in check by bemused police officers. â€œOnly when the public knows our suffering will the government pay attention,â€™â€™ said one parent from St Josephâ€™s School, Malad, explaining why so many parents had decided to stage such a dramatic protest.

Traffic around the area was disrupted for several hours as students blocked vehicles on J.J. flyover, D.N. Road, Flora Fountain and Mahapalika Marg. Central Railway services were also disrupted for half an hour as students staged a rail roko for 20 minutes before disbanding it. In spite of the inconvenience, most sympathised with the protesters. A motorist, stuck near the VSNL junction for more than 45 minutes, said most people were more critical of the government for imposing the fee hike.

At about 4 p.m., minister of state for education Rajendra Shinge arrived and promised the crowd that the government would take a positive decision within two days. However, the parents wanted a written assurance, which the minister refused. They were already furious over reports that chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh would not meet a PTA delegation. In fact, the CM had met the eightmember team and assured them that the government would reconsider the decision.

â€œWe had already kept the hike on hold until July 31,â€™â€™ said a spokesperson from the CMâ€™s office. By 5 p.m., the policeâ€™s patience seemed to run out and they began to chase the protesters away. The police had waited for long since they were inhibited by the presence of children and women among the protesters. â€œThey made a laughing stock of us,â€™â€™ said an inspector.

Farheen, a Class V student of Regina Pacis Convent school, fell and hurt herself while trying to run away from the police during the lathi charge. Mona Khan, a class IX student from Rehmatbai Habibai School at Dongri, said that she and her friends were just standing outside the maidan when a policeman chased them away, hitting them from behind. Another girl, from Dongri, Sadaf Shogankar, said she was having a cold drink at a nearby stall when a woman constable roughed her up. The police denied hitting anyone. â€œIn fact, one of the parents bit a constable,â€™â€™ said an inspector.

They said some of the parents had also hurled abuses at the police. The police arrested 36 people on charges of rioting, abusive language, assault on public servant and unlawful assembly before releasing them almost immediately on bail.

8,Parents protest new fee structure,"MUMBAI: The government resolution that has sparked the uproar links parentsâ€™ income to their wardsâ€™ fees.

Parents earning between Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh per annum will have to pay Rs 100 per month, while those earning between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakhs will have to pay Rs 200. Those earning more than Rs 3 lakhs have to pay Rs 300 as monthly fees.Currently, a nominal Rs 5 is charged.

Parents say the plan discriminates against English-medium schools and will cause divisions and tensions within the classroom. â€œChildren paying higher fees will look down on other children and demand extra facilities,â€™â€™ said Sharad K. whose son attends a school in Ghatkopar. Parents have always maintained that the scheme makes no sense since it will apply only to 265 schools and earn the state a mere Rs 20 crore.

9,BJP attacks Congress over anti-Sikh riots,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Wednesday launched a veiled attack on the Congress over the 1984 anti-Sikh riots as the party, Akali Dal (Badal) and National Commission for Minorities (NCM) regretted that even 18 years after the ""massacres"" there was almost negligible punishment to the culprits.

BJP General Secretary Arun Jaitley, Union Minister and senior Akali Dal (B) leader S S Dhindsa and NCM Vice President Tarlochan Singh also disagreed with terming the violence against Sikhs as ""riot"", arguing that riots take place between two sides and favoured ""exemplary punishment"" to the culprits which could act as a deterrent in the future.

""Even so many years after the massacres, several questions still remain unanswered... The violence indicated how far one can go just to win elections,"" Jaitley said here after inaugurating a website on the riots.

""Propaganda, publicity etc to win elections was understandable. But to clear a community is not,"" he said.

The former union law minister alleged that ""it was clearly evident how the government (of the day) attempted to suppress facts relating to the violence.""

""More than 3000 people were burnt in Delhi alone. But there has been almost no punishment. Only in 10 cases, there have been prison sentences,"" Jaitley said, adding, ""if such situation persists, there will be anarchy as people will lose faith in the law.""

10,Walkout in Assembly over Naxal arrests,"KOLKATA: The entire Opposition staged a walkout in the West Bengal Assembly on Wednesday over the Speakerâ€™s refusal to allow adjournment motions relating to the suicide of customs and central excise inspector Abhijit Sinha.

Three separate adjournment motions were brought to the House by leader of the opposition Pankaj Banerjee, senior Congress MLA Asit Mitra and SUCI MLA Debaprasad Sarkar.

However, Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim refused to allow the motions.

At this, opposition members were on their feet, demanding the resignation of the chief minister.

While the Congress staged an immediate walkout, Trinamul Congress and SUCI MLAs chose to shout slogans in the well of the House before joining in.

The opposition MLAs were also vocal over the harassment, humilitaion and physical assault of Calcutta University chemistry lecturer Kaushik Ganguly and two others in the name of extracting information from them for their alleged links with the Naxalite group Peopleâ€™s War.

Later, Banerjee criticised the way in which the police were handling the issue. â€œThe West Bengal police are harassing innocent persons in the name of interrogation for curbing the activities of the PW.

Sinha was threatened of his life by the police, which drove him to suicide,â€� he said. â€œWe will raise the issue during the no-confidence motion on Thursday,â€� Congress legislature party leader Atish Sinha said.

Investment in state At least 26 per cent of total industrial investment in West Bengal, over the past decade, has been concentrated in the Durgapur region, state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen told the state Assembly on Wednesday.

The minister said that Rs 19,775 crore had been invested in the state between 1991 and 2001.

While the total investment in Burdwan district during this period was Rs 5,325.34 crore, the Durgapur region, comprising Durgapur, Mangalpur and Angadpur, accounted for Rs 5,092 crore. However, the ministerâ€™s figures show that actual investment on the ground was not much, as Rs 4,492 crore was invested by the Steel Authority of India for modernisation and renovation of the Durgapur Steel Plant.

This means only Rs 600 crore was invested in the region by way of fresh investments.

Among the projects in the pipeline, Sen outlined various mini steel plants, alloys and sponge iron units that are likely to come up during the year.

Five sectors â€” metals, downstream of petrochemicals, information technology, agro-based industries and tourism â€” have been identified for intensive growth, the minister said.

11,Lord Jagannath’s bawdy charioteers,"BHUBANESWAR: Various rituals during the ratha yatra (car festival) mark Lord Jagannath out as a unique god, perhaps the strangest in the Hindu pantheon.

The one ritual that has kicked up controversy in recent years is the practice of the charioteers belting out no-holds-barred bawdy songs during the journey of the Lordâ€™s chariot!

The charioteer is known as dahuka and his songs as dahuka geeta.

There are, of course, divine charioteers attached to every chariot.

But these wooden charioteers draw their sustenance from the human charioteers and according to popular belief, Jagannathâ€™s chariot Nandighosh will not budge unless the dahuka perched atop it belts out songs full of ribaldry and titillating allusions often accompanied by coarse body movements.

Hereditarily engaged in the service of Lord Jagannath, the dahuka is believed to be born into a family of prostitutes.

He is supposed to pass the training to his child.

So, frequently small children are seen atop the chariot as part of their on-thejob training.The temple administration pays a meagre honorarium to them and some land is allotted to their family.

But the land allotted is generally not suitable for raising crops and these servants of the Lord live in poverty.

Says one old man who had acted as a dahuka for years: â€œOur only solace is we are known all over the world as charioteers of Lord Jagannath.

Our service is our passport to heaven.

So there is no question of looking for a living elsewhere.â€�

The kitchen of Lord Jagannath lays claim to being the biggest hotel in the world, feeding thousands of devotees everyday.

Interestingly the holy food, known as mahaprasad, can be partaken by all irrespective of religion,caste and creed.The kitchen of the Lord engages over 500 cooks known as supakaras. The cooking done in the kitchen has some peculiarities.

In the same oven nine earthen pots are placed and cooking is done simultaneously. There are 200 hearths in the kitchen, which dates to the 17th century.

Every day 56 dishes are prepared and offered to Lord Jagannath who is, therefore, known as chhapan (fifty-six) bhogi.

12,Fresh controversy dogs police over Naxal arrests,"MIDNAPORE: After the alleged brutal torture of Raja Bazar Science College lecturer Koushik Ganguly, the Midnapore district police have landed themselves in yet another major controversy.

Last week, on Wednesday and Thursday, they took away former Peopleâ€™s War state secretary Partha Sarathy Banerjee and PW organ Biplobi Yug editor Mithu Roy from Midnapore jail for interrogtion without taking permission from the court, which was mandatory.

The CJMâ€™s court asked the Midnapore jail superintendent to send a report on whether Banerjee and Roy had indeed been taken out of the jail by the police in violation of legal provisions.

The chief judicial magistrate of Midnapore had earlier refused to send the five arrested PW activists to police custody after they alleged that they were tortured in police lock-up.

Instead, the court had sent them to judicial custody.

Banerjee and Roy alleged on Wednesday they were taken from the jail to a room inside the police hospital on July 3 and 4 and interrogated throughout the day and night by senior police officials, led by additional SP Anil Srinivas.

The ASP threatened to kill both of them unless they divulged the names and hideouts of senior PW leaders of West Bengal. They were taken back to jail only after Banerjee began a fast unto death.

13,Students' protest over fee structure halts traffic,"MUMBAI: In an unprecedented protest, thousands of students, their parents and teachers from state-aided English-medium schools brought downtown Mumbai to a standstill for more than five hours on Wednesday afternoon as they protested the governmentâ€™s recent decision to impose an income-based fee structure in their institutions.

More than 5,000 people, from Agripada to Borivli, descended on Mohammed Ali Road, D.N. Road and Mahapalika Marg, choking traffic from noon to 5 p.m. to demand that the increase be immediately scrapped. Under the plan, some students will have to pay a minimum of Rs 100 a month, up from Rs 5.

Incredibly, despite being caught up for hours, horn-happy motorists and harried commuters seemed to support the little demonstrators in their uniforms. However, for many of the students, what started as a fun day out turned ugly in the evening when the police tried to hustle people away from the area. Many students, including girls, said they were treated roughly by the police and even caned.

Earlier in the afternoon, the police picked up some students, which led to a shouting match between the protestors and the police. Police officers denied that students were beaten up. â€œWe gave them time to disperse and when they didnâ€™t, we rounded up a few of them,â€™â€™ said an inspector from Azad Maidan police station.

The PTA United Forum, meanwhile, has asked parents not to send their children to school until the government reverses its decision, said S.H.A. Jamati, secretary of the forum. The protest began peacefully enough, with parents holding dharnas outside their respective schools in the morning before travelling down to Azad Maidan to attend a rally organised by the PTA United Forum.

15,NTPC decision not justified: Power minister,"PATNA: Power minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan termed the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) decision to regulate the power supply to the state from July 13 as unjustified and said it is being done for political reasons.

Replying to a call attention notice inside the assembly on Wednesday, the minister said there are differences between the NTPC and Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) over the matter of pending dues.

The minister said the state government will have to pay Rs 9,00 crore to the NTPC. Bihar chief minister had pleaded for relief in interest for the next five years in her meeting with the vice chairman of the planning commission because payment of such a large amount would affect other development schemes in the state.

The minister said the meeting was held in Delhi on June 14 between BSEB and NTPC officials on regulating power supply to Bihar.

He stressed that the NTPC officials in the meeting had stated if the payment limit was increased from Rs 22 crore to Rs 40 crore per month the state would be given 450 to 475 MW of power. But later the NTPC officials informed the state that for payment of Rs 40 crore the state will get only 274 MW of power.

The minister stressed that the state purchases Rs 50 to Rs 55 crore of power from NTPC every month and was paying about Rs 42 crore every month. â€œAround 80 per cent of the payment is being made every month and the interest rate is quite high,â€� Khan said.

He pointed out that Uttar Pradesh which owed Rs 4416 crore and Delhi which owed Rs 3601 crore were not given the same treatment by the NTPC.

16,Teachers protest discrepancy in salary,"PATNA: Patna University teachers are up in arms against the alleged arbitrary and discriminatory application of the judgement of the Patna High Court with regard to the fixing of their pay by the human resources development department of the state government.

The salaries of as many as 39 teachers of PU have been arbitrarily curtailed recently, ignoring the existence of the statutory body like the Bihar State University (constituent colleges) Service Commission.

Patna University Teachersâ€™ Association (PUTA) general secretary Amar Nath Singh pointed out that while disposing of the case relating to the demotion of university teachers in 1995 the Supreme Court had given time-bound directions to the universities, the state government and the university service commission for re-screening, and had also protected the interests of re-promoted teachers in respect of their pay and emoluments. Furthermore, time and again the court has upheld that the power to demote or promote a university teacher lies with the university service commission and not with the state government.

According to sources, all these directives of the court are being wrongly interpreted by the officials of the HRD department and the university authorities have wilfully chosen to toe the lines of the state government, ignoring the existence of statutory bodies like the pay fixation committee, finance committee and the syndicate. The pay fixation exercise was being done by the HRD department on a pick and choose basis as the pay of one teacher had been reduced while that of three others figuring in the same letter of appointment had remained unchanged, they said.

17,All-party team to meet PM today over Rly zone,"PATNA: An all-party delegation from Bihar will meet Prime Minister Vajpayee at around 7 pm on Thursday to plead for Biharâ€™s case on the newly formed East Central Railway Zone.

The 15-member delegation will include parliamentary affairs minister Ram Chandra Purbey, water resources minister Jagdanand Singh and power minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan besides leader of the Opposition in the assembly Sushil Kumar Modi, JD(U) leader Ganesh Prasad Yadav, Samata Party leader Uma Shankar Singh and others.

Two government officials will also accompany the delegation, which is scheduled to leave for Delhi by the 2 pm flight on Thursday.

Earlier, there were reports that chief minister Rabri Devi would lead the delegation. However, sources in the CMâ€™s residence indicated that four ministers would go instead of the CM.

The all-party delegation, led by Purbey, is being seen as a move to counter the move of Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee and CPM leaders of West Bengal. An all-party delegation from West Bengal had met Advani and Kumar recently to express their opposition over the bifurcation of the Eastern Central Railway Zone.

The matter cropped up inside the assembly on Tuesday when leader of the Opposition Sushil Kumar Modi raised the matter for an all-party delegation to Delhi. Rabri Devi informed the House that the RJD chief had held talks with deputy PM Advani on phone on Wednesday morning and sought time for a meeting.

18,Alert in Andhra over 2-day bandh call by PW,"HYDERABAD: The police sounded a high alert across the state on the eve of two-day bandh call given by the Peopleâ€™s War (PW) from Thursday, even as two Naxalites were killed in alleged exchange of fire with the police in Warangal district on Wednesday.

19,Panel for checks on hire-and-fire labour policy,"NEW DELHI: Despite endorsing the governmentâ€™s stand on liberalising labour laws, the second National Commission on Labour has put conditions on easier retrenchment, closure of establishments, the hire-and-fire policy and engaging of contract labour.

The 1,470-page report opposes the hire-and-fire policy without provision for a judicial review saying this is against the constitutional guarantee of the right to seek justice.

Though the NCL has said no prior permission would be required for retrenchment, it has recommended that the retrenchment should be accompanied by adequate compensation.

â€˜â€˜The compensation should be different for charitable institutions, sick and running companies,â€™â€™ the report says. In the case of sick ones, the retrenchment compensation should be 30 daysâ€™ wage for every completed year of service. For charitable institutions and non-profit organisation, retrenchment compensation should be 45 daysâ€™ wage for every completed year of service.

For running companies, the separation compensation should be 60 daysâ€™ wage for every completed year of service. For the easy closure of an industrial establishment, the NCL has recommended that instead of raising the threshold for exemption from government clearance from 100 to 1,000 employees in one go, the limit should be raised from 100 to 300.

If an establishment is closed, the compensation should be an additional 45 daysâ€™ wage for every completed year of service. It has also been recommended enactment of a single labour law, called the labour management relations law or the law on labour management relations, comprising the Industrial Disputes Act, the Trade Unions Act and the Industrial Employment (standing orders) Act.

20,State govt neglecting farmers: BJLP,"HYDERABAD: The Bharatiya Janata Legislature Party (BJLP) on Wednesday took strong exception to the governmentâ€™s â€˜apathyâ€™ towards farmersâ€™ plight.

Speaking to reporters, BJLP leader N Indrasena Reddy alleged that the government did not take any measures for alternative crops during dry spell.

The government lacked planning for alternative crops and was not prepared to supply short duration crop seeds, he said. Reddy alleged that the AP Seeds Development Corporation was misleading with its statement that â€˜red gram localâ€™ was available in the market for dry crops. â€œNo red gram variety with such name exists,â€� he said.

The corporation, in an advertisement, claimed that 1.50 lakh quintals of seeds were procured for supply to farmers whereas the corporation in its status report submitted to the government said that 1.22 lakh quintals were procured, he said. Indrasena Reddy wanted to know whether the Grameena Vithanotpathi Pathakamâ€™ and measures taken to supply seeds under it were still continuing.

22,CPM for Governor's rule ahead of J&K polls,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir unit of CPI(M) on Thursday disfavoured the dismissal of the Farooq Abdullah government in the state by the Centre and suggested that the state government itself dissolve the Assembly and recommend imposition of Governor''s rule ahead of the elections.

""We are against invoking of Article 356 in any part of the country but would suggest the National Conference government to recommend imposition of Governor''s rule to ensure free, fair and credible election s in the state,"" state secretary of CPI(M) and lone member of the party in the State Assembly, M Y Tarigami told reporters here.

He said the people of Jammu and Kashmir have been fighting for a long time against the ""unnecessary and unwanted"" intervention of successive central governments in the state. CPI(M) will not favour more central intervention and invoking of article 356 arbitrarily in any part of the country.

He said the demand for imposition of Governor''s rule in the state has come from several parties.

Tarigami said mere assurances that the elections would be free and fair cannot work. ""The Prime Minister and the Election Commission should come out with a mechanism to ensure free and fair elections in the state to restore shaken confidence of the people of Kashmir over the democratic process"".

""Settlement of the Kashmir issue can be postponed but day-to-day sufferings of the people cannot be ignored and put off,"" Tarigami said and suggested the separatists groups to reconsider their decision and participate in the elections.

He also asked the Centre to initiate dialogue with the people of Kashmir to find a solution.

""The Prime Minister should, in consultations with all parties, make a sincere effort to reach a consensus to initiate dialogue with the people of Kashmir,"" he said.

23,Tight security in Assam for tomorrow's bandh,"GUWAHATI: Security measures have been stepped up in Assam in view of the state-wide bandh on Friday to protest the formation of the proposed Bodoland Autonomous Council (BAC).

Official sources here on Thursday said additional security forces had been deployed in the vulnerable areas, patrolling intensified along bridges, highways and railway tracks and vigilance strengthened at vital installations.

The Sanmilita Janagosthiya Sangram Samiti, a non-Bodo organistion, has called for the day-long bandh fearing that the BTC would jeorpadise the rights of the non-Bodos.

The SJSS has also called for a rail-roko programme on July 15 on the issue.

Hurdles to the path of formation of the BTC have emerged with non-Bodo organisations opposing it and the Bodoland Autonomous Council (BAC) leadership voicing its displeasure.

Another non-Bodo political party, the United Minorities Front (UMF), has warned the government not to form the BTC which would result in ""harassment of the non-Bodos.""

BAC chief Kanakeswar Narzary has flayed the government for not consulting the BAC regarding the formation of the BTC as the government was bound to consult the council as per the BAC act.

Meanwhile, the state cabinet has already okayed the formation of the BTC with an all-party meeting agreeing to include 3070 villages in the proposed council.

The BTC is an upgraded version of the now almost defunct BAC.

27,Delhi BJP to seek LG's intervention against liquor policy,"NEW DELHI: Opposing Delhi government''s new Excise Policy allowing sale of liquor by private vendors, a delegation of BJP''s city unit will meet Lt Governor Vijai Kapoor tomorrow to demand that he withhold it. Delhi BJP MPs, MLAs, Corporators and other elected members will meet the Lt Governor and request him to deny clearance to the policy, Madan Lal Khurana, in-charge of the city unit, told reporters here on Thursday. He charged that the policy would have an ""adverse impact"" on children and could lead to deterioration in law and order situation. ""The ''free'' and ''open'' liquor policy announced by the Delhi government is against the spirit of the Constitution and the ideals of the Father of the Nation. The unfortunate decision to allow the sale of liquor at the departmental stores will attract youngsters towards the drinking habit"", Khurana said. He said the sale of liquor in Delhi was placed in the hands of the government ""because of adulteration of liquor by the private retailers which at times led to a number of deaths."" The Delhi Government''s decision to issue licences to farm houses and banquet halls to serve liquor ""is in contravention of the court decision that has banned parties at such places."" ""The Lt Governor can and should withhold it using his powers,"" Khurana said.

29,Cong gearing up for changes ahead of elections,"NEW DELHI: Following in the footsteps of the BJP, the Congress party too is gearing up for the assembly elections scheduled for next year, with organisational changes. The attempt is to bring in fresh faces and younger people to the party''s leadership in the states.

The first impact could be felt in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The high command has not taken kindly to the dissident activities in Maharashtra, which according to certain AICC functionaries, have been directed by Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee chief Govindrao Adik.

``The AICC leadership is not in a mood to change chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh right now. At the same time, the problems in the party have to be sorted out too. So the only way out is to change the PCC leadership. Also, a new leader might bring in some more dynamism to the organisation,'''' said an AICC functionary.

The names of the probable candidates that are doing the rounds are that of, Sushil Kumar Shinde and of two ministers from Maharashtra ^ Shivraj Rao Moghe and Manikrao Thakre.

In Andhra Pradesh, a change in PCC leaderhsip is almost certain with the AICC general secretary in charge of AP, Vayalar Ravi, complaining against PCC chief M. Satyanarayana Rao. In fact, Ravi had even written to Sonia Gandhi about a speech made by Rao allegedly against the Gandhi family.

According to a senior Congress leader, ``MSR is perceived as ineffective and being bankrupt of ideas an policy initiatives. He seems to be out of touch with contemporary politics of Andhra. Added to this is the allegations of possessing a loose tongue. There is a search going on for someone from the Kamma caste or from one of the backward castes.''''

30,Changes in BJP geared for assembly polls,"NEW DELHI: The changes in the BJP''s organisational set-up are clearly aimed at next year''s assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi, with Delhi clearly top-of-the-mind.

The new office-bearers include three from Delhi ^ one vice-president, former Delhi health minister Harsh Vardhan, and two general secretaries, former law minister Arun Jaitley (though elected to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat) and Delhi MP Anita Arya. Four of the office-bearers are from Madhya Pradesh ^ Pyarelal Khandelwal and Dilip Singh Bhuria, both vice-presidents, and Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Thawar Chand Gehlot, both secretaries. There are two from Rajasthan ^ Ramdas Aggarwal being the new treasurer and Jaskaur Meena, who has been made a secretary.

However, the state chiefs were not announced on Thursday by president M. Venkaiah Naidu. While former Delhi chief minister Madanlal Khurana will in all probability be Delhi BJP chief and Union sports minister Uma Bharati Madhya Pradesh chief, the party wants to decide what position to give to Mangeram Garg, the outgoing Delhi chief, who is likely to be made in-charge of the Aaajivan Sahahyogi scheme. Naidu, in fact, announced that he would be given some central assignment. Besides, senior Madhya Pradesh leader Vikram Verma may be inducted into the Union ministry.

But with Rajasthan, the party appears to have hit a roadblock. Another meeting was held on Thursday evening at Naidu''s residence to which deputy prime minister L.K. Advani came to resolve the issue of whether Union minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia should go to Rajasthan.

The new team sees a virtual clean sweep of the old office-bearers with only five surviving: Kailashpati Mishra and Gopinath Munde as vice-presidents, Sanjay Joshi as organising general secretary, Khandelwal, who was general secretary, is now vice-president, and Mukthar Abbas Naqvi, who was secretary, is now general secretary.

The team sees a preponderance of former ABVP leaders belonging to the Emergency period, just before and after as well as a handful from the RSS. The average age of the new team is 52.

Announcing the changes, whose objective was to build a team which was a combination of ``experience, dynamism, and youth'''' which would ensure ``victory'''' for the party, Naidu made it clear that the party would project its own idealogy, take the message of good governance to the people and try and remove the ``misconception'''' among the minorites. Interestingly, he recalled former president Bangaru Laxman''s Nagpur message, saying that if the minorities did not come to them, then the party would knock at their doors.

Referring to the speculation about Advani''s growing importance, Naidu said: ``Atal Behari Vajpayee is the tallest leader of the country, of the NDA, of the BJP. He is my leader and Advani''s leader.''''

31,Youth arrested with Army grenade,"BATHINDA: The arrest of a youth who was carrying a hand grenade has dealt a severe blow to the police establishment which had been exulting after the arrest of about 20 wayward youths just two days ago.

Thursdayâ€™s arrest has left people wondering what to expect next from young criminals who have already started killing for money. The most shocking aspect of the latest arrest is that the grenade recovered from the youth was reportedly stolen from Bathinda military ammunition depot.

Satish Kumar alias Monu, a resident of Bathindaâ€™s Nai Basti, had reportedly laid hands on the grenade during his month-long temporary service at the ammunition depot. He was one of about 500 youths who were temporarily employed by Army authorities for loading and unloading ammunition in vehicles three months ago.

Apart from the grenade, Satish and his cohorts had also managed to smuggle out some anti-aircraft gun cartridges. Other firearms recovered from them include country made pistols and cartridges. These were reportedly got from Tibbi in Rajasthan. Five members of the gang, including its kingpin Inderbir Singh Shahni, were arrested on July 9.

33,Cops suspect foul play in 'suicide' case,"AHMEDABAD: Sunita Singh (32), committed suicide recently at Shrinandnagar in the Vejalpur police station area. Singh had hung herself by her ''dupatta'' from a ceiling fan.

Local police as well as the victim''s parents, however, believe that there may be more to this ''suicide'' case than meets the eye.

A complaint filed by the victim''s father, Shyam Singh Raghav (62), alleging physical and mental harrassment by Sunita''s in-laws and the fact that her husband was in the house when Sunita hung herself on July 7, has got the police investigating into this case.

Ela Pathak, chairman of the Ahmedabad Women''s Action Group (AWAG), however, has questioned the police''s dilly-dallying attitude in making arrests in this case. Pathak told TNN: ""Why have the police failed to arrest the accused in this case? Those accused of dowry-related harassment leading to spouse''s death should be arrested immediately.""

Raghav, who is a a retired junior assistant collector of Aligarh, has alleged, ""It is unlikely that my daughter would commit suicide"". He registered a case against his daughter''s in-laws under the Dowry Act.

Raghav told TNN, ""In 1996, Sunita had got married to Shekhar Pratap Singh, an employee of Cadila, in Ahmedabad. Since about a year, Sunita was complaining of severe harassment at the hands of her husband and in-laws. She had also complained that Shekhar was having an illicit relationship. Sunita giving birth to a second baby girl, 16 months back, only compounded her problems.""

He added, ""Even on the day of the incident, Sunita had called me up in Aligarh and had said that Shekhar had threatened to beat her up if she was unable to bring a sum of Rs 10,000 forthwith.""

Raghav, in his complaint lodged with the Vejalpur police, has alleged that his in-laws had taken money from him when Sunita''s sister-in-law was to be married in February 2002. ""I had to pay a total of Rs 85,000 for marriage expenditures and gold ornaments. This money was never returned to me.""

Police officials investigating this case said that the victim had left a suicide note before hanging herself from a ceiling fan.

34,NCP wing protests school’s admissions policy,"MUMBAI: Our Lady of Lourdes School at Kalyan shut down for a day on Wednesday, after some activists from the Rashtrawadi Vidyarthi Congress, the Nationalist Congress Partyâ€™s student wing, held a demonstration outside the school. They were protesting against the schoolâ€™s admission policy, which they claimed was against the local communityâ€™s interests.

According to Father Franklyn Mathias, school manager, the authorities got an inkling of what was in store on Tuesday, when policemen turned up at the school. â€œThey told us that there was going to be a hunger strike in front of the school and that they had come to provide us protection,â€™â€™ Fr Mathias said. The School authorities had not received any prior information from the activists, who eventually turned up on Tuesday evening.

They promptly pitched a pandal outside the school, floating their banner, and demanded that the school principal meet them at the podium so that they could submit their memorandum, listing their complaints. â€œBy this time, members of the Parent Teachersâ€™ Association had already gathered at the school and we felt that it would be inappropriate for the principal to go to their podium to receive the memorandum,â€™â€™ Fr Mathias said. The principal and school teachers, nevertheless, went up to the school gate but the activists refused to budge.

The activists then started shouting slogans against the school and the principal, school authorities said. â€œThat was when school got over and the children were frightened by all that noise,â€™â€™ Fr Mathias said. Soon after, the school principal approached the police and requested protection.

As the atmosphere in the school was quite tense, the authorities decided to keep the school closed for one day. The school remains closed on all Thursdays.

Fr Mathias said that representatives of the activists finally sent in their memorandum to the school. The memorandum said that the school gave admissions to students hailing from outside Kalyan. â€œThe activists felt that 50 per cent of our seats were filled up with students from Ulhasnagar,â€™â€™ he said, adding that this was not true. â€œWe have always given preference to students from nearby areas,â€™â€™ he said.

The letter also said that the school did not give enough weight to recommendations from politicians, Fr Mathias said. The School authorities said that the whole trouble cropped up after the school refused admissions to two students recommended by politicians.

Dolphy Dâ€™Souza, spokesperson of the Bombay Catholic Sabha, said that they had asked deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal (NCP) to rein in the activists. â€œIt is July and schools are more or less done with the admissions anyway,â€™â€™ he added. Santosh Gaikwad, Rashtrawadi Congress Party office-bearer, told TNN that the school authorities asked for donations and that they gave preference to Ulhasnagar students. â€œWe submitted the memorandum in protest,â€™â€™ he said.

The school has denied that it takes donations. Two yearsâ€™ back, Shiv Sena activists barged into many schools, demanding admissions for candidates of their choice.
