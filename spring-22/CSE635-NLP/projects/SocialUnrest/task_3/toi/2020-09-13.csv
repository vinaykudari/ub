2,Bid to increase US investment,"PUNE:In a view to increase US investments into Pune, the Pune chapter of the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce is looking at a series of focused programmes in the coming year.

Attracting American investments into the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the city, especially the auto sector,would be on top of its agenda.

â€œThe SME segment is generally not a major thrust for most chambers of commerce. Therefore, we have decided to have a programme where they can interact with prospective US investors,â€� said Prasant R. Krishnan, director of city-based computer firm S-Tronnics and the newly-elected chairman of IACC, Pune chapter.

Since Pune is an auto hub, the seminar would bring in top US auto majors like Ford to talk to the auto ancillaries in the city about their specific requirements, enabling better business co-ordination among them, he said.

The other focus areas for the chapter this year would be manufacturing, IT, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. It would also stress on corporate governance, finance and education.

Some of the specific initiatives would include a programme targeted at making Pune a global destination for business process outsourcing (BPO). There would also be a programme targeted at increasing US contribution into the fast-growing area of biotechnology â€” both for research as well as financial investments.

All these initiatives are aimed at increasing the US investments coming into the industrial city by facilitating a dialogue between Pune companies and US companies interested in investing in the country, Krishnan told TNN, on the sidelines of the annual general meeting (AGM) of the West India Council of IACC, held on Friday. Incidentally, Pune accounts for around 16 per cent of the total US investments into India, which stood at $1.7 billion in 2001.

Earlier, addressing the chapter members at the AGM, Angus Simmons, consul-general of the US consulate in Mumbai, said the consulate will give full support to the chamberâ€™s activities. At present, the bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $15.5 billion, he said.

He added, â€œThere are 2.6 million Americans of Indian origin, including nobel laureates, who have made a huge contribution to our country.â€� Also, there are 67,000 Indian students studying in the US, the largest group of foreign students in that country, he added. Further, he said that Indians, with 140 members, form the largest caucus in the US Congress.

The RJD chief said that after reading about the controversy he inquired about the matter.

""There was no breach of protocol at any point and the police was with him throughout his visit,"" Laloo maintained. ""Chinmayanand has often made statements that it was unsafe to travel in Bihar after darkness. Even if he was without security, he travelled through Siwan and Motihari in the night safely. He must now say that Bihar is a safe place,"" Laloo remarked sarcastically.

He recalled that the Union minister was scheduled to visit the CM''s house at 8 pm.

""We are spending from the amount we have been given as Clamity Relief Funds. But after the water level subsides, we will make an assessment of the damages and ask for further financial aid from the Centre,"" the RJD chief said.

He blamed the Centre for denying the state its legitimate share of the Central funds. ""Nor is the Union government showing any interest in speaking to Nepal to find a permanent solution to floods in Bihar,"" he remarked.

Laloo stressed that he would soon be dictating a book on his experience during his visit to Pakistan. ""I have asked for collection of all the news reports published during the period,"" he said and added that it also contain his philosophy on international relationshiop and even on Kashmir.

5,"Polytechnic students go berserk, assault principal","JAMSHEDPUR: Students of the local government polytechnic in Adityapur near here allegedly assaulted their principal and vandalised the institute on Saturday.

A group of students went on a rampage, even as the police foiled an attempt by four boys to self-immolate themselves in the afternoon. Two of the students, Amit Kumar and Sunil Kumar, had to be rushed to a nearby nursing home after they fell unconscious apparently by accidentally consuming kerosene oil during scuffle with police.

About 50 first and third-year metallurgy students, who had put up a road blockade on the busy Adityapur-Kandra road near the institute since 10.30 in the morning, have been up in arms against the polytechnic authorities for failing to organise training programme in any of the two integrated steel plants in the state.

Eyewitness said the mob turned violent after the police foiled the self-immolation bid and took four students into custody. The protestors barged into the principal K K Sinhaâ€™s chamber and vandalised the office.

Sensing trouble, Sinha had moments ago left his chamber. But the students chased and caught hold of the principal before severely assaulting him. The police and government officials stepped in to save Sinha, eyewitness added.

The principal was not available for comments.

The Sakarikela-Kharsawan deputy commissioner Dhirendra Mishra and the district superintendent of police Bimal Kishore Sinha had to intervene to mollify the agitating students. Police personnel have been deployed at the institute.

The minister of science and technology Samresh Singh would hold a meeting with the students and polytechnic authorities to resolve the problems, the SP said. The minister is also expected to meet Tata Steel managing director B Muthuraman to arrange for the training of the students.

The students blame the authorities for not organising the training programme at the Tata Steel and the Bokaro Steel Plant. â€œOur second year result has been withheld because the training programme was not held. We were told at the time of admission that the training would be held in any of the integrated steel plant. We canâ€™t be asked to go to any company to complete the training,â€� the students complained.

6,Lashkar had planned suicide strikes in Ayodhya,"JAMMU: After striking at the Akshardham temple last year, Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba had planned suicide attacks in Ayodhya and then on Amarnath pilgrims to arouse communal passions and trigger riots, but these did not work out as those on the mission were killed in an encounter, well-placed security sources said.

Citing examination of documents and a laptop computer recovered from a top LeT commander killed in Kashmir last month, they said that the outfit could still be working on another plot to carry out a strike in Ayodhya, particularly at or around the disputed area, in view of religious sentiments attached to the place.

""LeT had planned a strike in Ayodhya in a run-up to the anniversary of the Babri mosque demolition on December 6 last year,"" the sources said.

However, the plan went haywire as two terrorists sent to carry out the strike were killed in an encounter in Tuglakhabad in south Delhi in November while on way to Ayodhya, they said on the basis of coded information contained in the documents, a laptop computer and digital diary of LeT commander Manzoor Zahid Choudhary.

Choudhary, LeT''s chief coordinator for operations outside Jammu and Kashmir, was killed by the BSF on the outskirts of Budgam on August 8 following a specific information.

The outfit then planned a strike on Amarnath pilgrims two months back, they said, citing the documents.

A recce was carried out by the outfit''s leaders in Pahalgam, base camp for the pilgrimage, on July 3. However, it is not clear why the strike was not carried out, they said, adding intense security arrangements might have deterred them.

Hailing from Lahore, Choudhary used to operate under various code names, including Abu Marshad, Abu Nadeem, Abu Zeeshan, Munna and Abu Zarar, they said.

Based in south Kashmir, his wireless code was Manzoor, the sources added.

According to the BSF, Choudhary was also linked to the Akshardham temple attack as it was he who had sent the fidayeens'' to Ahmedabad.

The sources further said that Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh were high on target list of terrorists and these outfits had roped in some local fundamentalist organisations to help in their designs.

10,Rickshaw-pullers to protest against fuel price hik,"PUNE: Rickshaw Panchayat, the leading union of three seater rickshaws in the city, will stage demonstrations in front of the local offices of Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum on September 20. The demonstration is a step to demand that the oil companies roll back the recent hike in petrol and diesel prices.

In a statement released on Sunday Rickshaw Panchayat President Baba Adhav said that Panchayat activists will assemble at the local offices of the oil companies at 12.30 pm and stage demonstrations. Later the activists will go to the district collectorate at 2.30 pm and submit a memorandum to district collector Madhukar Kokate with a request that he forward the same to the union petroleum minister Ram Naik.

The Panchayat has demanded that the recent price hike be rolled back, Adhav said.

He pointed out that Petroleum Minister Ram Naik has given a public assurance that prices of LPG will not be increased in the coming months. ""However the minister kept mum about prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene,"" he remarked.

Adhav stated that the union government has given permission for unchecked profiteering by oil companies by blaming the manufacturing companies in the Gulf for fluctuations in oils prices. ""The price hike can easily be checked if the union government so wished,"" he observed.

Adhav said that rickshaw drivers have to bear additional monthly expenses of Rs 350 on account of the price hike and can not pass on the same to customers, as it affected business.

He said that in addition, rickshaw drivers were being heavily fined for even minor offences and sometimes their permits were suspended for 20 days. ""On the other hand six seater rickshaws, which flouted all rules were treated in a lenient fashion,"" he added.

11,BJP 's agitation politically motivated: JD(S),"MYSORE: State JD(S) Chief Siddaramaiah on Sunday termed the BJP leaders agitation against H D Devegowda on his alleged remarks against Lingayat and Vokkaligas as ""politically motivated."" He said that his party would launch counter agitation if the BJP leaders fail to stop it.

At a press meet, he said it exposed the prevailing desperation among the BJP leaders over their party''s losing support base in Karnataka.

""By this cheap tactics, the BJP leaders are under the impression that they can gain votes and recover their lost base, but Karnataka people who are known for their secular credentials and tolerance will not allow them to succeed,"" he said.

He said it is not the first time the BJP is indulging in such a ""smear campaign"" against Devegowda. In the past on the eve of bypoll to Narasihmaraja assembly seat also, they spread such a canard to enrage the religious sentiments of majority people, he recalled and said: BJP leaders should realise the fact that their party will go into oblivion in the next assembly elections.

""What moral courage they have to unleash such a campaign against Devegowda on a trivial issue, when their party leadership in Gujrat has been admonished by the Supreme Court over the communal carnage in Best Bakery case,"" he asked and taunted: ""People who are responsible for killing human beings are talking about cow slaughter and beef eating.""

Referring to KPCC chief Poojari''s prediction of Sonia visiting the state to inspect drought and farmers houses, who have committed suicide, Siddarmaiah dubbed her visit as an ""election gimmick.""

Why Sonia Gandhi failed to inquire about the suicide deaths and visit the farmers houses, when she visited the state on earlier occasions, he asked and said fast approaching of elections has forced Congress leaders to go on such trips and indulge in such electoral stunts.

He said same Sonia Gandhi extensively toured Andhra Pradesh last year when the farmers suicide incidents were reported from there, but she failed to take cognizance of such incidents in Karnataka. ""I want to ask him, why she criticised Naidu and spraed Krishna over farmers deaths,"" he asked and said the irony is elsewhere in the country number of such incidents are on the decline where as in Karnataka number is rising alarmingly.

Asked about Hungund bypoll, Siddaramaiah said his party candidate is going to win the seat hands down and the fight is between JD(S) and Congress candidates. ""All other candidates presence in the field is nominal,"" he added in reply to a question on AIPJD prospects.

Asked about merger of JD factions, Siddaramaiah said most probably it will end by October 1. ""If the whole AIPJD fails to merge majority of it''s leaders and cadre are going to join JD(S),"" he said revealing that ""give and take"" process is on between the people, who are for merger.

12,People fed up with Cong govt: Siddaramaiah,"MYSORE: State JDS chief Siddaramaiah who dubbed Congress government headed by Krishna as ""package"" government said people who are fed up with these packages are waiting in wings to ""pack it off"" from the state.

At a press meet here, JDS chief was referring to the recent package announced by Krishna government and said people are bored to hear about allegedly such bogus packages.

The government is claiming of giving a relief to the tune of Rs 888 crore to the farmers, but all the relieves announced by it are book adjustments and nothing will accrue to the farmers.

Neither the Rs 330-crore waive off of IP power bills is realistic nor the Rs 200-crore market intervention scheme is going to benefit them when they have no rains to raise crops,"" he said.

When farmers have stopped digging open wells, government says that it has waived off Rs 22 crore on these wells, he pointed out adding that Krishna government has developed skills to tell blatant lies.

""If the government is genuinely concerned about the farmers it should immediately direct banks to stop all the dues and waive off interest on all the loans borrowed by them,"" he said.

13,Sena to observe protest day in colleges,"PUNE: City unit of Shiv Sena has given a call to observe a protest day in all city colleges on Monday to condemn the utter chaos in admission to engineering and medical colleges and the exorbitant fees demanded by private institutions.

In a statement released here on Sunday, Shiv Sena MLA Vinayak Nimhan alleged that the state government was acting as agents of the so called shikshan samrats.

If the government so wished it can compel the private institutions to reduce their fees to affordable level, he said. He added that all the government has to do was to remember that the students of today would be the doctors of tomor-row who would treat the future generations of our country.

Nimhan remarked that the government can not shirk its responsi-bility by pointing fingers at the court verdict and that it will have to play an active role in solving the problems. He suggested that the state can revert back to the old system of merit seats and payment seats where it was possible to subsidise poor students by using the extra money taken from rich students. Nimhan urged the govern-ment to make all efforts to bring back the old system and said that commercialisation of education should not be allowed under any circumstances.

Nimhan further demanded that the government issue an ordinance and take over all private colleges to protect the fundamental right to education given by the constitution.

As a mark of protest about the existing chaos about medical and en-gineering admissions, Shiv Sena has urged students in all city col-leges to wear black badges tomorrow.

Meanwhile the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad has started a helpline (phone number 4331468) to help parents and stu-dents solve any admission related problems. Vivek Shirude, secre-tary, Pune unit of ABVP, has urged parents and students to contact them id they needed any help.

Earlier on Saturday, around 30 ABVP activists and 200 parents staged demonstrations in front of the Vishwakarma Institute of Technology to protest against VITâ€™s insistence that students give demand draft of the full fee amount for securing admis-sions. Shirude stated that it was not possible to give DD of the full amount immediately and that students be given some time to ar-range the money.

ABVP activists stalled the admission process for over an hour after which VIT officials assured that students would be given five days to submit DD of the full fee amount.

Shirude stated that many par-ents and students have been calling the ABVP helpline and inform-ing about various problems faced by them.

""If necessary, covering fire is also provided by Pakistan army to facilitate infiltration,"" said shehzad citing his personal experience.

15,Cattle owners resent being pushed around by govt,"AHMEDABAD: Over 7000 Maldharis from Kutch, Chotila, Surendranagar, Saila, Patdi and Ahmedabad gathered here at the Maldhari Cricket Maidan to protest against the government policy on stray cattle.

They say that they have been driven out of villages as grasslands have disappeared and now they are being harassed even in cities. At the congregation here on Sunday, they said that contrary to notions, the problem of stray cattle is not restricted to urban areas.

Gujarat Maldhari Adhikari Manch member Dasrat Desai says, â€œOur cattle have nowhere to go. In villages, the land notified by the government as cattle grazing land is encroached upon and taken over for other purposes. While in official records the land continues to be notified as a â€˜gaucharâ€™(grazing land) for cows and buffaloes, in reality it does not existâ€� he says.

In many areas, the grasslands have degraded and cattle are unable to graze. Many Maldharis are forced to move out. â€œIn cities our fate is similar.

There have been many Maldhari settlements in villages around Ahmedabad but these villages now form a part of the city.

There were many common grasslands and ponds. These have disappeared. Maldharis being landless and less educated faced the problem of sustaining livelihood. â€œLand owners grab lands as they can afford it, but for us there is no place,â€� says Desai.

According to him, the Maldharis are ready to co-operate with the government, including the AMC and the AUDA authorities.

â€œIf there is stray cattle on city roads we are ready to help them catch them. The stray cattle do not belong to us.

â€œThese are â€˜unproductiveâ€™ cattle. But the authorities are not serious about capturing them. Instead they capture cows tethered near the Maldhari settlements. Their modus operandi reveals a racket to somehow fleece ownersâ€� he said.

â€œWe want land, if we get another place to keep the cattle we would be pleased to extend a helping hand to the civic authorities,â€� he said.

Many Maldharis at the congregation highlighted the irony that while on the one hand the politicians promote worship of cows and protection for cows they are insensitive to the people who tend them.

They said that the recent crackdown on cattle is uncalled for. It is a black law and should be withdrawn.

The land sharks, the builders, contractors and industrial houses backed by government turned grasslands into concrete jungle. They should be blamed.

16,To view or not to view extinct Bastar Mynah,"RAIPUR: The Bastar Hill Mynah, declared the state bird of Chhattisgarh last year, is caught in the cross-fire between principal chief conservator of forests R C Sharma and chief wildlife warden Anoop Bhalla.

The bird is on the verge of extinction and last year, only around 50 Bastar Hill Mynahs were spotted. Ten of these were sighted at Tirathgarh in Kanger Valley of Bastar. Four were kept in cages at the Forest Training School of Jagdalpur.

The fracas centres around the four caged mynahs at the Forest Training School. The chief wild life warden had ordered that the birds must be kept out of public sight. However, the chief conservator objected, saying: â€˜â€˜Since the Pahari (Hill) Mynah is a state bird, any decision on it can only be taken by the state government.â€™â€™

According to Sharma, the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) had recommended that the public showing of the Bastar Mynah must be stopped. â€˜â€˜But I have rejected its recommendation as it is the state bird and people must see their state bird.â€™â€™

Bhalla, meanwhile, said: â€˜â€˜We will allow only video shows of the endangered species. Contact with the public must be withdrawn.â€™â€™

17,Broke Modi govt wants Centre to run hospital,"GANDHINAGAR: The PMO-funded superspeciality hospital at Bhuj, which is nearing completion shortly, is likely to be handed over to the central government as the state government is reluctant to run the set-up for lack of funds and the proposal to hand it over to private hands or an NGO has not been found feasible.

The Gujarat government has recently conveyed to the PMO and Union health minister Sushma Swaraj that the 300-bed hospital â€” built near the site of the GK Hospital which was damaged in the 2001 earthquake â€” should be managed by the Centre.

The old hospital had collapsed in the earthquake and more than 200 people, including patients, doctors and nurses, were buried under the debris. Prime Minister Vajpayee, during his visit to Kutch soon after the quake, had sanctioned Rs 100 crore for the hospital and the PMO had directly monitored its construction.

Officials here said the state government was keen that the Union health ministry took over operations and maintenance of the hospital as it was not possible for the state government to bear the recurring cost of at least Rs 13 crore per annum. The state government used to spend around Rs 3 crore on running GK Hospital.

The hospital, having an earthquakeresistant design, has been constructed as per international specifications for structural safety.

The model has been taken from hospitals located in earthquake-prone zones in Japan, China and USA. The hospital has 15 wards and three modern operation theatres. It is equipped with the latest gadgets and machines for performing surgeries.

State health minister IK Jadeja told TNN that Chief Minister Narendra Modi had requested Vajpayee to inaugurate the hospital in October. The state governmentâ€™s proposal for setting up of an attached medical college and nursing school at the hospital has already been approved by the central government and is now awaiting the Medical Council of Indiaâ€™s consent.

Jadeja said that the state government had invited delegates to an international seminar on disaster management scheduled to be held in Bhuj on September 30.

The Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority has organised the seminar as a part of the Navratri festival.
