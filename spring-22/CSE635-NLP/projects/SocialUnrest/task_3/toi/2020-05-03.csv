0,Marad violence: BJP sees conspiracy,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The BJP state unit today said last night's violence in Marad beach near Kozhikode, which left nine persons dead, was a 'fundamentalist conspiracy' and demanded an 'impartial and credible' inquiry to unearth all aspects of the incident and punish those behind the 'one-sided attack' that targeted a particular community of fisherfolk. The unit also apprised the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the party president of the situation and urged the central leadership to send a delegation of MPs and organizational functionaries for an on-the-spot assessment. ""What has happened at Marad were not clashes but one-sided attack on a particular community as often happens in Jammu and Kashmir or some North Eastern states. Such an attack is unheard of in Kerala. This was well-planned and meticulously executed"", BJP state general secretary P P Mukundan told reporters here. He also came down heavily on the UDF government for its ""intelligence failure"". Meanwhile, a Kozhikode report quoting BJP National executive member and state President-elect, P S Sreedharan Pillai, said the party wanted a CBI probe into the violence. The UDF government, of which the Muslim League is an ally, had 'failed' to trace the culprits with state police, he said and said CBI alone was competent to probe it. ""That police recovered a huge quantity of arms from an organisational centre in the minority community area points to their involvement in the attack"", Sreedharan said. ""Antony should not hestitate to order a CBI probe if the UDF government is really interested in ending such acts"", he added.

1,"'Pride' of zoo: Prince, Shubhangi and Aastha","LUCKNOW: Speculation about the names for the lion and the lioness at the Lucknow Zoological Gardens, was laid to rest on Saturday, bringing the month-long wait for the christening of the big cats to an end.

From among the 25 names proposed by employees of the zoo, three lucky names were selected by zoo director Eva Sharma and zoo veterinarians Utkarsh Shukla and Ashok Kashyap.

Prince, the name which the five-and-ahalf-year-old lion was christened with, was suggested by Basanti Devi, while Shubhangi, the name chosen for the four-yearold lioness, was suggested by Rajesh Nigam. The five-year-old lioness was christened Aastha. The ''royals'' were selected for their shimmering skin, youth and their playfulness. Deepak Kumar, one among the staff members who brought the royals down to the Lucknow zoo, said the selection of the ''royals'' was a tough task indeed, as stress had to be laid on their nature, facial expressions, diet, teeth, behaviour, age, the kind of meat they consume as also the mane.

Certificates were distributed to employees whose names were selected by the zoo authorities at the christening. Comparing the Chatbir zoo with Lucknow zoo, employees said the Lucknow zoo had a higher sale of tickets, better security, and a larger variety of animals.

However, Lucknow zoo veterinarian Ashok Kashyap said that the Lucknow zoo has to better its medical facilities and operation theatre, in order to be at par with the Chatbir zoo at Chandigarh.

2,Edgy farmers fall for Bt Cotton fantasies,"BATHINDA: No decision has been taken yet on Bt Cotton in Punjab. Nonetheless cotton farmers, who are already disillusioned by the poor yield of the past few years, are falling prey to traders who are painting pictures of lush fields of cotton for them.

Traders, sources claim, are making good money by selling spurious or ordinary seeds to farmers under the brand name of Bt Cotton.

Farmers of this cotton growing area are already in debt thanks to the spiralling cost of pesticides. The yearly attack of American Bollworm has also taken its toll on their patience. They are now anxious to reap the benefits of the new technology of Bt-cotton, sources told Times News Network.

This is in spite of the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee''s decision (GEAC) to delay the commercial cultivation of Bt Cotton for a year. Bt Cotton was found to be susceptible to leaf curl virus attack.

The intrepid and desperate farmers are doing all they can to procure the seed. Sources claim that certain dealers are selling the seeds to the farmers on the sly. Dealers are said to be charging as much as Rs 2,000 for 900 gms of seed, sources said.

Pretending to be a farmer the Times News Network team spoke to a seed dealer in Faridkot over the telephone. TNN said that they wanted to buy hybrid seeds, the dealer immediately suggested that they could go in for the Bt Cotton seed. While speaking about the numerous benefits of the Bt Cotton seed, he claimed that the government had approved its sowing.

The cultivation of Bt Cotton at Sikhawala farm of Punjab Agriculture University had not been satisfactory. The dealer, however, said that the experiment had been a run away success and not a single pesticide had been used on the crop.

""We know that some farmers are sowing Bt Cotton seeds which they have procured on their own. We''re advising them against it,"" a senior agriculture officer told TNN. ""The farmers won''t listen to us. Our advise is falling on deaf ears. The spectre of American bollworm is still haunting them. They are willing to throw caution to the wind,"" he added.

The Bathinda police, which had got a complaint about the sale of Bt Cotton and fake seeds in the name of reputed companies, recovered about 125 packets of cotton seeds during a raid at the residence of Chander Bhan Rahul Dev, a firm here.

The haul contained 54 packets of Bt Cotton seeds. BKU leaders, on the other hand, have accused the agriculture department officials of being hand-inglove with dealers.

4,OU cautions students on Edcet rules,"HYDERABAD: Osmania University has asked students applying for Edcet to take note of the prescribed rules.

Mistakes made by the candidates would lead to errors in dispatch of hall-tickets and declaration of results, the university has warned.

One of the common mistakes made by the students is using two different photos â€” one for the application and another for the ICR bio-data form. Use of faded photos and sending torn or creased forms are not acceptable.

The students have been asked to be careful in writing the subject code, signing and writing the correct centre name with its corresponding code number. Submission of two applications with different centres or having two signatures would lead to discrepancies when the candidates are allotted seats.

Students were advised to study the booklet carefully and fill out the required information. The last date for submitting forms is May 15.

5,PGI rules out SAR in Kuldeep's case,"CHANDIGARH: The SARS scare at the PGI was put to rest with doctors ruling out 30-year-old Kuldeep Singh as a suspected case on Saturday. The hospital administration has shifted Kuldeep from the isolation ward to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU). Clarifying their stand, a senior PGI official said,

""Kuldeep was admitted with respiratory symptoms after being referred from Hoshiarpur. Though there was no epidemiological history of being a SARS patient, yet immediately he was isolated as a precautionary measure, till he was ruled out as a case of SARS."" A senior doctor said that

Kuldeep was shifted to RICU after exclusion diagnosis for further management. His relatives were examined by resident doctors of the community medicine department who subsequently ruled out any chance of SARS epidemiologically in them.

6,State government frees quarantined patients,"PUNE: Close on the heels of the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaration on Thursday that India is Sars-free, the Maharashtra government on Saturday â€œfreedâ€� all the quarantined people housed at the Siddharth hospital, besides the nine staff members of the hospital who had tested positive for the coronavirus, that causes Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).

State health minister Digvijay Khanvilkar, while announcing the decision after a state-level high-power committee meeting here on Saturday morning, said the decision is also applicable to all the 70 other people kept under house quarantine.

He, however, clarified that the health authorities would remain vigilant. â€œScreening at the airports will continue as before and people are still advised to report any Sars-like symptoms to the authorities.â€� Although the WHO and the Union government have ruled out a single case of Sars in the state, there is no room for being complacent, he said. â€œA decision on software professional Ashish Atal, who is currently admitted to the isolation ward at Sassoon hospital, will be taken after the National Institute of Virology submits its report after analysing the fluid samples,â€� Khanvilkar said. He, however, added that all reported cases in the state are totally Sars-free. â€œEven Stanley Dâ€™Silva, his mother Vimla and sister Julie had certainly tested positive for the coronavirus, and were declared as Sars-affected, but that was not the case,â€� he said, adding that the three were only â€œinfectedâ€� people.

Referring to the WHO guidelines, he said the people detected of carrying the virus did not fulfil the criteria of Sars as they were totally asymptotic. â€œThe same is the case with the nine hospital staff members who also tested positive for the coronavirus, but didnâ€™t show any symptoms.â€� According to the WHO, a person infected with the coronavirus will not infect others unless he starts manifesting the Sars symptoms, which include cough, sneezing, acute difficulty in breathing etc. â€œFortunately, in Maharashtra, none of the persons who tested positive for coronavirus showed any virulent symptoms,â€� he said. Khanvilkar, while maintaining there was no â€œdifference of opinionâ€� with Union health minister Sushma Swaraj over the issue, said total co-ordination was maintained at all levels. He, however, admitted to certain lapses by junior doctors of the Brihamumbai Municipal Corporation while releasing Hong Kong-based businessman Bhaskar Murthy from the Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Infectious Diseases without getting nod from the director-general (D-G) of the state health services. â€œThe D-G has submitted his report to the government and we are planning to take action against the erring doctors,â€� Khanvilkar said.

Saturdayâ€™s meeting, called to review the situation in the state following the WHO guidelines,was attended among others by the principal secretary of public health, Navin Kumar, directorgeneral of health services, Dr Subhash Salunkhe, additional director Dr P.P. Doke; NIV director Dr A.C. Mishra and senior resident director of health, government of India, K.H. Tanuja. Asked to clarify the stand on the NIV reports of the samples, Salunkhe said there was no reason to doubt the findings.

7,J&K govt chalks out plans of tourism revival,"NEW DELHI: As the Jammu and Kashmir government is planning to slug it out with militants, it is also making attempts at a war footing to bring tourists to the state by announcing lucrative schemes and plans for the same.

To begin with, state Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed visited Bollywood and held wide-ranging discussions with producers and directors and also requested them to visit the Valley once.

The visit was encouraging and producers decided to make a move to shoot films in Kashmir and the response was also prompt by the state government by offering loans upto Rs one crore by Jammu and Kashmir Bank under an easy instalment scheme.

The state government was roping in local beneficiaries like houseboat owners, taxi and bus drivers and shikarawalas in creating an atmposphere congenial for tourism, says Minister of State for Tourism, Ghulam Ahmed Mir.

""The tourism industry suffered a serious setback with gun-toting militants from across the border stepping up violence. The election results have shown that people of the state have shed their fear and are ready to even act as human shields to lure tourists to this paradise on earth,"" Mir said.

The state once bustled with activity with many Bollywood crews pitching their tents in this pictureseque valley but they started opting for safer places like Himachal Pradesh and other hill states in the wake of militancy, the minister said.

""Now the J and K Bank is offering loans to the tune of Rs one crore and it has also been ensured that anyone availing of such a facility will have to visit only one window,"" the minister said.

8,I was approached to topple Mufti govt: Farooq,"NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Sunday claimed that President of the ruling coalition''s Panthers'' Party Bhim Singh had approached him for support of his National Conference in forming an alternative government after it succeeded in toppling the Mufti Mohammed Sayeed government.

""Yes, he (Singh) came to me and sought the support of my party to form an alternative government after he had toppled the Sayeed government in the state,"" Abdullah said here after his extensive tour of Jammu region.

The statement of Abdullah was likely to cause rumblings of possible political uncertainties in the state.

""Panther''s Party leader came to me and showed me the list of MLAs who were supporting the alternative government but I told him that they should prove their majority before the state Governor,"" Abdullah, who is now a Rajya Sabha member, said.

Efforts to reach Singh for his comments could not fructify as he was away and the Panthers'' Party leaders in the capital refused to comment on the issue.

Abdullah, whose National Conference is the single largest party, made it clear that his party would not encourage toppling game but would behave like a ""responsible opposition.""

""There are so many MLAs waiting to defect and lead the state to political instability but we are not in favour of that,"" he added.

To a question as to what would be the role of National Conference in case the government collapsed, Abdullah said: ""We will like to cross the bridge when it comes. We will weigh all possibilities before taking any decision.""

Commenting on the Sayeed government''s performance, he said ""it is unfortunate that the graph of militancy has increased manifold during the last six months of his tenure.""

""Minorities as well as majority community have been targetted during his tenure and the government has failed to check it,"" the former chief minister alleged.

""There is not only a desire but yearning for peace in Kashmir rather than (need for) shallow healing touch,"" he said sarcastically referring to the present government''s policy.

To a question about the initiatives announced by Prime Minister on Friday to ease tension between India and Pakistan, he said: ""We have welcomed his statement and I hope that this is actually a final and successful attempt to normalise relations between the two countries.""

9,'Food riot' at UNHQ cafeterias,"UNITED NATIONS: It was a virtual ''food riot'' at the United Nations cafeterias when workers went on a whirlwind strike and left their workstations on Friday.

Hungry patrons, including diplomats and staff members, helped themselves to everything in sight, even silverware. Some who had fridges in their offices stuffed them with enough food to last a few days.

Even the bar in the diplomatic lounge was not spared and diplomats and others helped themselves to the liquor with no one to prevent the ""looting"" or charging money.

Left stranded were Secretary General Kofi Annan and members of the Security Council who were holding their private monthly luncheon in the delegate''s dining room. They were served only the main course and left to fend for themselves dessert and coffee. There was no one to clear the tables.

A food contractor''s official estimated that food worth US$7000 to 9000 may have been ""looted"" on Friday, and that excludes the ""raid"" on the delegates lounge''s bar.

The trouble started when the outgoing food contractor informed workers that their vacation pay, which had not been cleared till May 2, would be the responsibility of the new contractor and the latter said it would not honour that.

The Restaurants Associates which had the contract for running UN canteens and cafeterias for the last 17 years lost their bid to Aramark Corporation, the largest food service company in the United States, in March.

Friday was the last day of the Restaurants Associates contract. Later, the new contractor came to an understanding with the workers union. Things are expected to be back to normal on Monday.
