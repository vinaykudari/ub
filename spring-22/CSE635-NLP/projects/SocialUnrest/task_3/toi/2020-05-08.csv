0,Dal factions will merge before polls: Bommai,"HUBLI: All India Janata Dal national president S.R. Bommai, who failed to bring about the merger of Janata Dal factions, is still confident that the divided factions will unite before the forthcoming elections.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, he said the two Dal factions are in the process of re-unification after having resolved to unite and form a new national party to challenge the hegemony of Congress and BJP.

However, he said there was no question of giving up the party''s association with the NDA. The main aim of AIJD is to activate the party and strengthen its position at all levels, Bommai noted.

He said the party is of consequence, not individuals. There being hardly any worthwhile opposition to the Congress in the state, the JD intends to consolidate forces pursuing the same ideology, he said.

Besides, Bommai said the proposed merger of two factions in the state will create new equations at the national level, which will go a long way in forming the third front.

The former chief minister said the secondline leaders of the state unit of JD (U), a section of JD (S), and JD (neutral) leaders have been trying to forge a merger of all likeminded parties set against the BJP and the Congress.

He said efforts are on to convince the JD (S) leaders to abide by the merger formula mooted by him and Deve Gowda is learnt to have offered to speak to Ramakrishna Hegde to convince him to change his party''s decision.

He said there could be a meeting between Gowda and Hegde soon.

1,Getting married? Don't forget to inform govt!,"BANGALORE: You may soon have to seek permission from the state government before conducting a marriage.The Karnataka government is considering a proposal to make it mandatory for citizens to keep the government informed whenever a marriage is solemnised. The move follows complaints that child marriages are being conducted in the guise of mass marriages.

""Unlike in North India, where child marriage is conducted openly, here in the South, children are married off clandestinely and often in mass marriages. We are examining a rule whereby anyone who conducts a marriage, especially a mass marriage, should keep the government informed,"" women and child welfare secretary D. Thangaraj told The Times of India.

The Supreme Court recently issued notices to 10 states, including Karnataka, for their failure to check child marriages. ""Often, child marriages go unnoticed and it is difficult for the government to go on inspections whenever a marriage is conducted. So, we do not receive any complaints. Whenever such incidents come to our notice, we send a team of officers from the women and child welfare department. But it is usually too late and tough to prove,"" Thangaraj said.

The department has written to the home commissioner to direct superintendents of police (SPs) to initiate action against families which marry off children. ""These families, especially in rural areas, justify their action by citing poverty as the reason for disposing of children. They do not have any age proof records, making it difficult for our officers to prove that a child has been married off,"" women and child welfare director B.R. Jayaramaraje Urs said.

Department officials admit that incidence of child marriage comes to their notice only through the media, especially when politicians and ministers grace the occasion.

Last year, then minister of state for urban development B.B. Chimmannakatti came under the media glare after he attended a ceremony where children below 18 years were married.

The government is also exploring the possibility of amending the Child Marriage Restraint Act, a central enactment. ""Since the law department has informed their inability to amend a central Act, we may have to write to the Centre,"" U r s said.

The government move follows complaints that child marriages are being conducted in the guise of mass marriages.With children getting married off clandestinely in mass marriages in the south, the government is examining a rule whereby anyone who conducts a marriage, especially a mass marriage, should keep the government informed.

2,Failed click: Land record ordeal for farmers continues,"PATHANKOT: It is the same old story at all the divisional headquarters of Punjab districts on a working day.

There are exhausted people, particularly the farmers, lined up for hours, just to get a copy of the land record from the concerned revenue officials.

To make matters worse, the muchhyped and centrally funded project for computerization of land records (CLR) refuses to take off.

Sources said while the pilot project of land records computerisation of Fatehgarh Sahib district had been hit by lack of software, the farmers continued to suffer in Gurdaspur district as all the six revenue sub divisions including Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Batala, Dera Baba Nanak and Dhar Kalan did not have the computer hardware so far.

As per ministry of rural developmentâ€™s annual report (2002-2003), the Union government had released Rs 13.15 crore towards central share for strengthening revenue administration and updating of land records, as on January 31, 2003. Even as Punjab government had utilised Rs 10.98 crore of the amount, no discernible change at the tehsilâ€™s functioning was seen so far.

Farmers rue that due to lop-sided policies of the government, they have to run from pillar-to-post to get the land records.

Gurdaspur deputy commissioner KAP Sinha when contacted said though the district administration had the required computer hardware, the software for computerisation of land records was yet to be developed. Experts, however, say that software should not be any problem as funds were available.

3,BJP's 10-day protest ends,"AMBALA: The 10-day long dharna organised by Ambala cantt BJP unit to protest against the illegal suspension of the chairman Shankar Dass, who is also a senior BJP leader, concluded here on Thursday.

The general secretary of Haryana BJP Veer Kumar Yadav who came to meet the party workers on the concluding day of the dharna said that the matter was brought to the notice of the party high command by the senior leader of Haryana BJP.

He said that the party high command would take some concrete decision in the near future. On the issue of Fatehabad by-election, he said the party high command would issue clear guideline within a day or two.

Criticising Mr Chautala, he said the BJP has tried its best to maintain cordial relations with INLD but chief minister Om Prakash Chautala had made every effort to demorolise and weaken the BJP in the state.

He said that the BJP has decided to fight the next assembly elections on its own. Former deputy speaker Faquir Chand Aggarwal, the suspended chairman Shankar Dass and district president Bharat Bhushan Jatwar were present.

4,INLD MLA's election set aside by HC,"CHANDIGARH: At a time when it is in the midst of an electoral battle to retain its hold on the Fatehabad constituency of the Haryana Vidhan Sabha, the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) suffered a setback when the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday set aside the election of its legislator Ram Phal Kundu from the Safidon constituency in the Jind district.

Justice Viney Mittal, who had reserved the judgment sometime ago at the conclusion of arguments, pronounced it on Thursday declaring Kunduâ€™s election to the legislature in the general election held on February 22, 2000, as void while allowing the petition filed by independent candidate Kamal Sharma. Justice Mittal also ordered that fresh elections be held for the constituency.

The election has been set aside on the ground that the returning officer had wrongly rejected the nomination papers of Sharma as a candidate of the Congress despite the authorisation in his favour issued by the then Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee chief Bhupinder Singh Hooda, now leader of the opposition in the assembly.

Sharma and Bachan Singh Arya had claimed to be the nominee of the Congress and both had submitted authorisation letters written by Hooda. However, the returning officer accepted Aryaâ€™s nomination as the Congress candidate on the ground that his authorisation had been issued subsequent to that of Sharma and as such superseded the earlier one.

Justice Viney Mittal observed that the nomination papers of the petitioner Kamal Sharma were wrongly and improperly rejected as once the election commission had ordered scrutiny of the papers, it was indeed the duty of the returning officer to find out as to which one of the two was the nominee of the Congress. This was not done and as such the orders of the returning officer of February 8, 2000, were clearly unsustainable in law and improper.

5,MKVDC workers stage protest,"PUNE: Employees of the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) held a demonstration outside the Sinchan Bhavan on Wednesday to protest against the non-payment of their salaries for the months of March and April.

This is the 13th time in the past one-and-a-half years that employees of MKVDC had to agitate against the state governmentâ€™s failure to pay their salaries on time.

The government needs Rs 54 crore every month for paying salaries to 52,000 employees in the MKVDC and Vidarbha, Godavari, Tapi and Konkan irrigation corporations.

Speaking to TNN, Ramesh Agavane, chairman of the action committee of irrigation employees said that the committee had recently met state finance minister Jayant Patil, irrigation ministers Padamsinha Patil and Ajit Pawar and irrigation secretary Nandkumar Vadnere to discuss the delay in payment of salaries.

â€œWe were given an assurance that salaries for March and April would be paid by May 5. However, the government failed to keep its promise once again,â€� he said.

When the action committee contacted the ministry on Tuesday, they were told that the salaries have been delayed due to technical reasons.

Agavane pointed out that employees were fast losing their patience as they were finding it difficult to run their homes. â€œThe new academic year is fast approaching and employees have to pay their childrenâ€™s school fees and buy books and uniforms,â€� he said. The financial crunch has further worsened as banks no longer give us loans, he said adding that employees of Godavari, Tapi and Vidarbha irrigation development corporations were also similarly affected.

Agavane stated that the government expected the respective corporations to pay 80 per cent of the salary amount from the money raised through bonds, while the remaining 20 per cent was to be given from state coffers.

The Rs 500-crore special vehicle bonds floated by the state government recently generated poor response. â€œThe Godavari corporation received Rs 27 crore,Vidarbha got Rs 11 crore, Tapi received Rs 41 lakh, Konkan was given Rs 76 crore while the MKVDC received only Rs 9 lakh,â€� Agavane said. He explained that barring the Konkan corporation, no corporation was in a position to pay the 80 per cent salary amount.

The irrigation projects undertaken by MKVDC have already come to a standstill. â€œBut we are carrying out maintenance of the old projects regularly so it would be wrong to say that the employees should not be paid any salary as they have no work,â€� Agavane said.

He stated that the action committee would soon chalk out an agitation programme to demand regular payment of salaries. â€œNext time, we will gherao top officials to press for our salaries,â€� he said.

6,Flouting water harvesting rules may invite punishment,"HYDERABAD: The new AP Water, Land and Trees Act, 2002, may be made more stringent to punish or reward citizens in order to enforce mandatory construction of rainwater harvesting structures in the state.

With groundwater levels plunging and the water harvesting programme making little headway, the government is considering making some changes in the Act to enforce construction of eco-friendly conservation structures in the state, especially in Hyderabad.

An official said building plans would be approved only after construction of water harvesting structures. Fines up to Rs 5,000 would be imposed on first-time violators of the law.

Enough time will be given to construct water conservation structures, but if people still do not act, the penalty would be doubled. If they continue to flout the law the building permission could be cancelled, he added.

He said the fine will be Rs 1,500 for a plot of 200-300 sq m, Rs 2,500 for a plot of 301-400 sq m and Rs 5,000 for plots of 401 sq m and above. Commercial complexes, multi-storeyed buildings and non-residential areas will be fined Rs 5,000 for breaking the rules, he added.

The official said there would be incentives for those who take up construction of water harvesting structures promptly. He said the government will give a one-time rebate of 25 per cent on property tax or a maximum of Rs 1,000 (whichever was less) in such cases.

7,Software firm chief arrested for duping customers,"HYDERABAD: The Central Crime Station investigators on Thursday arrested Vinsri Infotech managing director C Suresh for duping 1,500 clients to the tune of Rs 20 crore.

Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) M Satyanarayana Reddy said Suresh had started the firm in 1997 and the data entry business commenced in January 2002. He collected Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh non-refundable deposit from each client promising them to give data entry work.

The company provided the data entry of novels, medical transcription, management and e-Books and paid Rs 30 crore of the Rs 40 crore deposits to the clients towards the bill for the data entry work.

The company, which appeared to have been sailing smoothly, ran into rough weather in February this year when cheques issued by Suresh were dishonoured by bankers due to non-availability of funds.

The clients began demanding either to provide work and clear the bills, or to refund their deposits. When Suresh failed to respond, the clients approached the police and lodged separate complaints. Subsequently, he was arrested on Thursday.

Police said that Suresh had opened seven branches in the city and those who are in-charge of these branches operated as brokers in getting the deposits. The brokers had even collected Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 from each client for getting them data entry work.

Suresh, a resident of Snehapuri in Cyberabad metropolitan area, owns one house, an office premises and a car. The properties will be attached soon, Satyanarayana Reddy said, adding that efforts were on to nab the brokers and attach their properties too.

8,Oppn calls Andhra bandh on May 21,"HYDERABAD: A meeting of opposition political parties and organisations on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution calling for a state-wide bandh on May 21 to protest the governmentâ€™s failure to tackle the drought situation.

Speaking at the meeting, AP Congress Committee (APCC) president M Satyanarayana Rao criticised the government for failing to take up adequate drought relief measures. The Food-for-Work scheme was being misused by the TDP leaders, he alleged.

Satyanarayana Rao accused chief minister Chandrababu Naidu of being a â€œslaveâ€™â€™ to the World Bank.

Speaking on the naxalite problem, he asked the government to treat it as a socio-economic issue rather than a law and order one.

The APCC president called upon the Left-wing parties and organisations to join the fight against the governmentâ€™s policies and its failure to alleviate the drought-hit peopleâ€™s distress.

CPM state secretary B V Raghavulu alleged that the governmentâ€™s actions were initiated only at the behest of the World Bank â€” including the recent GO 90 which paved the way for privatisation of hospitals. The government was trying to encourage private and corporate participation in the health sector which would result in denial of medical facilities to the poor, he said.

The opposition parties also demanded that the government continue the mid-day meal scheme for children, extend old-age pension to people and pregnant women and issue ration cards and house sites to the poor, supply drinking water and fodder in the drought-affected areas, 10 kg of rice to the eligible poor, waive power dues and crop loans and prioritisation of the irrigation sector in the state.

The round-table meeting was held to discuss the implementation of drought relief works and to extend support to the May 21 nation-wide general strike call given by the Central trade unions opposing the anti-worker policies of the Centre.

CPI leader K Narayana, AP Rythu Sangham general secretary T V Chowdary, All-India Rythu Coolie Sangham leader Gade Diwakar, AP Mahila Samakhya leader P Prema Pavani and several leaders of various organisations spoke.

9,Songadh bypolls a test for Modi's popularity,"AHMEDABAD: The byelections to the Songadh assembly seat in Surat district, slated for May 21, is expected to be a test of popularity for chief minister Narendra Modi.

In the first byelection since the assembly elections sweep by the ruling party in December last year, the BJP has decided to highlight the development activities in the state undertaken by the state government.

A senior BJP leader said the outcome of the byelection would be crucial for the party as it had turned complacent after the victory in the recent assembly election.

The Songadh seat was held by Congress MLA Nagarbhai Diveliyabhai Vasava, who died recently, necessitating a byelection. The welfare measures drawn for adivasis under â€˜â€˜Gujarat Pattern'''', evolved on the basis of Bhuria Commission recommendations is the main BJP poll plank. The Congress is striving to draw the attention of tribals towards the failures of the government.

The BJP has fielded Kantibhai Reshmabhai Gamit, while the Congress candidate is Kantilal Mangiyabhai Gamit.

11,RBI's Mohan says govt revenues a fiscal concern,"BOMBAY: Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Rakesh Mohan said on Friday that government revenues, rather than expenditure, were a fiscal concern.

""There is a great requirement for fiscal correction at the central and state levels, but that has more to do with revenue, and not expenditure,"" Mohan told a business gathering.

India''s federal and state governments have a combined fiscal deficit of nearly 10 per cent, one of the highest in the world, leaving little money for health, education and social development in the world''s second most populous country.

India aims to control its runaway deficit at 5.3 per cent of GDP in the year to March 2004, compared with 5.9 per cent in the past year.

12,Quit criticising govt openly: Advani to NDA,"NEW DELHI: In the wake of the attack on telephone tariffs from within Parliament, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Friday advised NDA constituents against openly criticising the government policies but raise them at the appropriate forum.

""Whatever views one may have, there should be no public criticism. It should be done at the appropriate forum,"" he said launching BJP''s Sahyog Cell which will see regular interaction between party ministers and cadres.

Hitting out at the opposition parties, he said ""their efforts were only to see how to create a rift within the NDA partners, between parties and government and within the Parivar.""

Advani took a dig at those who were trying to create a divide between him and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee especially the media saying ""this was a puerile approach"". He was referring to reports about his absence in Lok Sabha on Thursday when Vajpayee was replying to a debate on Indo-Pak relations.

On the recent three-day meeting of the Sangh Parivar which was attended by the top leadership of BJP, RSS, VHP, SJM and BMS, he said ""this was a conscious effort by the Parivar to have synergy within the ideological family and these meetings would be held on a regular basis.""

On Indo-Pakistan relations, Advani said he was fully in agreement with what the Prime Minister had stated in Parliament for the neighbour to stop cross-border terrorism. ""How can you have friendship with Pakistan if it doesn''t dismantle terrorist infrastructure,"" he said.

The Deputy Prime Minister appreciated the systematic manner in which BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu has been organising the party and having frequent interaction between party ministers, MPs and workers.

Speaking on the occasion, Naidu hit out at Congress and Opposition parties saying they should first put their own house in order before criticising the ruling NDA.

He referred to the action against Congress MPs in Lok Sabha who had raised a Calling Attention Motion on defence matters.

He said the party fully supported the Prime Minister''s peace initiatives with Pakistan and ""we want him to move forward. It is a coalition and once government decides, the entire party is with him.""

13,Tell US to keep off Indo-Pak ties: RSS tells govt,"NEW DELHI: As Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage arrives here, the RSS on Friday asked the government to emphatically tell the US to keep its hands off Indo-Pak ties even as it demanded that return of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) should be the basis of any ""political"" dialogue with Islamabad.

Without directly naming US or Armitage, RSS Spokesman Ram Madhav told reporters here, ""there is a beeline of foreign dignitaries visiting New Delhi and Islamabad... However, we have to keep in mind that they are indirectly trying to give an impression to the world that they were involved in the efforts to resolve Indo-Pak disputes.

""It has to be borne in mind that the contribution of the very same external forces is not small in perpetuating the Indo-Pak dispute in the last five decades. We need to make it emphatically clear that Indo-Pak issues are purely bilateral and there is no scope for third party intervention at all.""

Alleging that the Pakistani ""efforts"" to restore normalcy in bilateral ties were ""insincere and being made only to please someone"", he said had they been sincere, they would have allowed overflights of Indian planes and opening of the consular office in Karachi.

Endorsing the government resolve to enter into a dialogue with Pakistan subject to its putting an end to cross-border terrorism, Madhav said, ""without finding a solution to Kashmir as per the unanimous 1994 Parliament resolution seeking return of Pakistan occupied Kashmir to India, no political relation can be established between the two countries.""

He, however, said RSS was not opposed to restoration of cultural, sporting and aviation ties with Pakistan.
