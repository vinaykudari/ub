0,"Demolish Sainik Farms, enforce law: Panel","new delhi: a committee set up by the municipal corporation of delhi (mcd) to look into illegal constructions in the posh sainik farms locality in south delhi has recommended a survey and demolitions to enforce the law. a report by the three-member committee comprising additional commissioner (engineering) vishnu swarup sharma, deputy commissioner south k c aggarwal and deputy commissioner central zone bhuvaneshwar singh was submitted before the delhi high court on tuesday by mcd counsel raman duggal. a bench comprising justice anil dev singh and justice madon lokur said the matter would be placed before a bench hearing public interest matters on july 20. the report said a public notice should be issued for conducting a survey so that the mcd teams could have easy access to all properties. this will make it easy for the corporation to identify unauthorised constructions in sainik farms. the committee was constituted by the municipal commissioner following the court's order asking the corporation to present a comprehensive policy on demolitions in the locality, where well-connected people have built houses illegally. the committee recommended that each case should be looked into separately to ensure demolition of all properties. the report said: ""the survey teams should be directed to examine at least 20 properties every day and prepare separate files on each unauthorised house so that no portion of a property was left without being demolished."" the report said the entire exercise should be completed in 21 days and the actual demolition drive should follow soon. the demolition should be under the supervision of separate teams comprising an assistant engineer and four junior engineers, the panel said. the committee said heavy machinery should be pressed into service for speedier demolitions and necessary funds be provided to the concerned deputy commissioner of the zone to engage contractors for the purpose. no member of the demolition teams should be transferred from the zone till the demolition was completed, it said. the committee cited public resistance and inadequate police force as the reasons for failure of the earlier demolition drives. the court had earlier sentenced two junior engineers to two months imprisonment for filing false affidavits before the court over demolition of unauthorised properties. however, one of the junior engineers has filed a review petition against his conviction for contempt of court, which would come up for hearing on july 13.

2,Fee hike in govt aided colleges,"kolkata: monthly fees in government and government aided colleges in west bengal will be increased from the 2001 academic session, state higher education minister satyasadhan chakraborty announced at a press conference here on tuesday. the minimum fee, which was so long rs 12 for ba (pass) courses, has been raised to rs 50. for the remaining courses, the fee structure will be: ma/m com rs 125, msc rs 160, ba (hons) rs 75, b com (pass) rs 60, b com (hons) rs 85, b sc (pass) rs 85 and b sc (hons) rs 110. ""the ashoke mitra commission had recommended this fee hike in 1992, you can say that the decision came rather late from our side. every year new subjects are being introduced, new sciences are emerging on the horizon, laboratories are being spruced up...all this requires a lot of money. if the state is offering such a high standard of education for the students, the guardians of the latter should also share the burden with us"" chakraborty said. the minister said that the state government was not being able to bear the financial burden of running these colleges out of the state exchequer anymore. ""the cost per student is a minimum of rs 600. all this while the student paid only rs 12 on his part. this is ridiculous. even after the hike the state will bear a lion's share of the burden. i do not think that the hike is too steep."" the old fee structure was in force for more than 50 years now. ""it was relevant those days, because the students used to bear 50 per cent of their education cost. over the years prices have increased but the fees have remained the same, with the result that students are now bearing less than five per cent of the cost of their education"", the minister informed. ""we have kept in mind the interests of the poor. students who cannot afford to pay the fees because their family income is very low, need not panic. such students can submit certified details about their family's income. the respective college offices will review these cases and ultimately after enquiry, if the principal considers it fit, the fees of the concerned student will be waived"", the minister said. ""each college will have to use the extra revenue generated because of such a hike, to improve its own infrastructure"", the minister said. he also said that his department has made it mandatory on every college to pay its part time teachers a minimum stipnd of rs 2000 per month. ""so long these teachers were arbitrarily paid a very low stipend. this must stop"", he emphasised.

""everybody is not rich. even today majority of the people in our state are either poor or hail from the middle class"", said former msu students union vice president amar dhomse. he suspected that there was a design in minting money in the name of payment seats.

4,Fernandes for contesting polls on common platform,"lucknow: national democratic alliance (nda) convenor, george fernandes, on tuesday said that the alliance partners should contest the forthcoming assembly elections in uttar pradesh under one banner and platform. addressing the workers' convention at the ravindralaya, the nda convenor said that he had broached this idea to the bjp leaders and a final decision in this regard could be taken only after they approve of it. he said the alliance partners could contest the elections even while maintaining their separate identity. fernandes suggested that the votes polled by the samata party candidates in the panchayat and local bodies poll in a particular constituency should be taken into account before conceding the seat to the candidate. the nda convenor said that the coming assembly elections were crucial in many ways for the national polity. in a veiled dig at the union telecommunications minister, the nda convenor said that the culture to nominate the workers in the committees should be discouraged. he said he was pained to see his workers scrambling for telephone committees' membership. fernandes said he had never become a member of such committees in the past. fernandes lashed out at the marxist accusing them of double-speak. he said that though they claim to be the champion of underdog, they invited foreign investors saying that kolkata is the gateway to india for the multinationals. to prove his socialist credentials, the nda convener invoked the name of late socialist leader rammanohar lohia and said he was religiously following his ideals. former president of the samta party, jaya jaitly, said that the party should be prepared for the assembly elections in utter pradesh. she said that with the emergence of new politics of coalition, a different kind of problems had arisen in the country. but the rot that had set in during the 45-year-rule of the congress could not be set right in a day, she said. she said the samta party suffered humiliations at manipur to save the vajpayee government because ``we felt that the survival of the central government was essential.'' jaitly said that the recent practice of presenting video footage to bring the point home was dangerous .in such a practice, even an innocent person could be presented before the people as taking bribe as had been done during the tehlka expose. she said since fernandes had eliminated the middle-man in defence deals, the vested interests hatched a conspiracy to malign him. jaitly also cited the example of tamil nadu where two different kinds of video footage were shown to bring their point home.

5,Fluorosis menace fails to move govt,"patna: the slow but sure death faced by the residents of khairi, a village located in haveli kharagpur of munger district, reflects complete government apathy to the public health in the state. a report reaching the state headquarters here suggests that 80 per cent of the villagers suffer from fluorosis. health minister shakuni choudhary expressed his complete ignorance over the problem in the village. ""however, i will ask the civil surgeon to look into the matter,"" he stated while speaking to the times of india on tuesday. incidentally, choudhary's native village is in munger district, and haveli kharagpur is represented in the state assembly by powerful rjd leader and former minister jay prakash narayan yadav. haveli kharagpur was in the news recently due to 40 deaths within three weeks on account of cerebral malaria. the first case of fluorosis was reported in 1975 after the first tubewell was installed in the village having a population of about 2,500. ""before the installation of the tubewell, our drinking water source used to be a well,"" recalls arvind sah, a resident of the village. cases of villagers suffering from backache and weakening of limbs have been reported to the district administration repeatedly, but for the last 25 years there has been no effort on the part of the government to give medical relief to the villagers or to provide them with an alternative source of drinking water. fluorosis, which results from the intake of excess fluoride and causes thickening of bones and destruction of nerves, has struck the village in a major way as almost every family appears to have been afflicted with the disease in varying degrees. the symptoms start with a hip pain which spreads to other parts. ""in the 1990s, a few of the affected poor villagers had to sell off their land to go to the aiims in delhi for treatment. it was from the persons returning from delhi that we learnt that we are suffering from fluorosis,"" stated harikishore yadav, a resident of the village, who started having pain in the hip last year. the entire village depends on agriculture, but most of the villagers have been rendered incapable of working in the fields. brahmadev sahu, 45, is lying in his deathbed. he spent all his wealth on treatment at the aiims in 1999, where he underwent an unsuccessful operation to give him relief. despite being warned by the aiims doctors not to drink the water of the village tubewell, he and his family do not have any way out. as he silently waits for his death, his main worry is that his wife meera devi also suffers from the same disease and walks around their small hut in great pain. their son bumbum kumar, 16, suffers the same plight though in a lesser degree. ""this is the plight of most of the families here,"" remarked haridev yadav while stressing that they are losing their family members at a relatively young age. according to media reports, apart the children getting their feet twisted by the disease, there are 20 critically ill persons in the village. the civil surgeon's report to the health minister may be too late to save them.

9,Centre working on procedure to arrest ministers,"new delhi: taking a serious note of what happened in tamil nadu, the centre is working on a mechanism to prevent arbitrary arrest of any central or state minister by any state government in the event of a law and order problem. the union home and law ministries will together formulate some sort of a convention which will not give immunity to ministers but will ensure 'proper' procedures are followed to establish any guilt before arrests of ministers are made, a senior cabinet minister said on tuesday. ''some kind of a screening system has to be there before a minister is arrested,'' he emphasised. few cabinet ministers expressed their displeasure over the tamil nadu government's announcement of a one-man inquiry commission to look into the police ''excessess'' committed during the arrest of dmk chief k. karunanidhi. as soon as the regular agenda of this morning's cabinet meeting was completed, the two dmk ministers -- murasoli maran and t.r. baalu -- raised the issue of their arrests by the tamil nadu police on june 30 and wanted to know what measures the centre was contemplating to prevent such happenings in the future. maran and baalu, who attended the cabinet meeting for the first time after their arrests, were 'agitated' over the action taken against them by the jayalalitha government and insisted the centre should consider what happened to them in the larger perspective. during the discussion on tamil nadu, which lasted more than 45 minutes, various questions were raised with regard to state government's failure to provide constitutional guarantees to an elected representative. the senior minister said some message has to go to state governments that before they arrest a minister they have to ensure what the crime is. prime minister atal behari vajpayee, who presided over the cabinet meeting, directed the ministers for home and law and justice to have a separate meeting with maran and baalu to gather inputs from them.
