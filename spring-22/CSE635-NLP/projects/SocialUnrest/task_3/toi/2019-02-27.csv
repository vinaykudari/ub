1,"Modi may revamp party, reshuffle portfolios","ahmedabad: the bharatiya janata party in gujarat may be in for a major shake-up. chief minister narendra modi, who won the assembly bypoll from rajkot-2, is expected to consolidate his position in the party. the feeling in the bjp is that the rajkot seat was won because the party had the chief minister as its candidate, while defeat in sayajiganj and mahua reflect the losing grip of the party in the state. with this new mandate, modi might also reshuffle portfolios. the exercise, however, will be carried out only after budget session of the state assembly gets over by the end of next month, sources close to modi said. the bjp leaders are expected to once again go into a huddle, like they did when they lost the sabarmati and sabarkantha elections last year, and discuss what can be done to revive the partyâ€™s fortunes if it has to win the assembly elections due in one year. over-concentration on rajkot and over-confidence in the other constituencies are being cited as the reasons for the partyâ€™s debacle in the two seats. even in rajkot, the victory margin of 14,728 for modi is considered quite handsome but is not very impressive considering the fact that the former finance minister vajubhai vala who vacated the seat for modi had won by nearly 27,000 votes.

4,Assembly begins with call for govt's ouster,"gandhinagar: the gujarat assembly began its month-long session on a strident note here on tuesday with upbeat congress mlas making a written request to governor sundar singh bhandari to dismiss the ""corrupt"" state bjp government and hold fresh polls. the written request was handed over by senior congress leader udaysinh baria as soon as the governor entered the assembly hall to inaugurate the last budget session under the current bjp rule. the memorandum, signed by nearly all congress mlas, said the modi government had ""lost all moral right to rule the state after the three by-polls."" soon after submitting the memorandum, several congress mlas led by sabarmati mla narhari amin threw petals of lotus in the well of the house. the memorandum said the new modi government had failed to stall the deterioration that had set in the administration, as reflected in the bypoll results at mahuva and sayajigunj. ""even at rajkot-2, the cm has won, not the bjp,"" it added. ""if keshubhai had to go because of the bypolls at sabarmati and sabarkantha, then why should there be a different standard for modi?"" frequently interrupted by slogans from the congress benches demanding the dismissal of the bjp government as it had ""lost the confidence of the people of the state"", the governor''s speech was not audible for most of the half-hour he addressed the house. even as bjp mlas were heard shouting back, the governor went ahead with his speech unmindful of the din. speaker dhirubhai shah''s appeal for silence went unheeded. shah told the mlas: ""i have been told by the governor to establish peace. it would be better if we listened to his speech without disturbing him. in parliament, which opened its budget session on monday, the speech of president of india was listened by all mps without any disturbance. we must take cue from that."" yet, sitting on their chairs, often thumping the tables, the congress mlas continued their sloganeering unabated. led by congress mla raghavji patel from jamnagar district and two others, who was up on his feet at regular intervals, the slogans included the demand to give support price to the farmers and jobs to the unemployed. one congress mla, khumansinh chauhan, even shouted slogan that justice be provided to ex-cm keshubhai patel, who was summarily removed from power in the wake of the bjp debacle in two bypolls in september last year. keshubhai, who attended the morning session, seemed pleased and smiled in response.

6,No decision yet on helmet rule,"pune: the regional transport office (rto) on tuesday clarified that the state government has not conveyed a final decision on making helmets compulsory for twowheeler riders in the city, as yet. the clarification comes in the light of recent newspaper advertisements inserted by helmet shops claiming that there was little time left before helmets become compulsory in the city. a statement released by the rto said the advertisements were misleading. the state government has postponed its decision to make helmets compulsory in pune; the rule was to come into force on december 1, 2001. after vociferous protests from people and populist politicians, the government appointed a committee under u k mukhopadhyay, principal secretary to the deputy chief minister, to hear the views of the people. the committee heard representations by puneites on february 21 and will submit its report to the government shortly, the release said. the government will take a final decision after studying the report, which will be conveyed to the bombay high court and suitable action will be taken subsequently, it added.

7,"No smallpox cases here, says minister","mumbai: state health minister digvijay khanvilkar said on tuesday that there were no cases of smallpox in mumbai. the minister sought to allay fears of an outbreak, following a report in a city tabloid. the minister said that the health department of the brihanmumbai municipal corporation had sent a team to the dispensary in saki naka, where a local doctor was reported to have diagnosed three cases of smallpox. civic health officer alka karande said that these cases were probably that of chicken pox. â€œit was irresponsible of the doctor to declare the cases as smallpox without test,â€™â€™ she said. under section 421 of the bmc act, smallpox is listed as a notifiable disease. the world health organisation in 1980 had declared that smallpox had been successfully eradicated and no cases of the disease have been reported since then. explaining the symptoms, bombay hospitalâ€™s microbiologist ms lina deodhar said that smallpox starts with high fever, headaches and upper respiratory tract infection.

10,"Bad policy deters FDI in hardware, says survey","new delhi: india is losing out to its neighbours like taiwan and china in attracting foreign investment in hardware sector â€” mainly due to tariff and other policy deficiencies in contrast to the countryâ€™s continued dominance in the export of software, economic survey said. â€˜â€˜very low investment is taking place in hardware industry and foreign investment is going to taiwan, china, brazil, malaysia etc. there are problems in hardware production, which may be summarised as distorted tariff structure, poor infrastructure, high cost of finance, industrial, fiscal and exim policy, labour laws and inspector raj and low volumes of production,â€™â€™ said the survey. while the computer software industry is likely to witness a cumulative growth of over 52 per cent and the hardware industry is likely to grow by 11 per cent during the ninth five year plan. the survey further noted that software exports would witness a lower growth of over 40 per cent during 2001-02 at rs 40,000 crore against rs 28,350 crore in 2000-01, which had translated into a 65 per cent jump, while the overall electronics hardware and computer software exports are projected to touch rs 48,500 crore during the current fiscal. â€˜â€˜the computer software and services exports are amongst the fastest growing exports in the indian economy. even globally, india is recognised as a major software player,â€™â€™ the survey pointed out. the software industry, which was worth only rs 645 crore in 1991-92 and accounted for only nine per cent of production, had now surpassed electronics hardware production.

11,Call to improve agricultural policy,"new delhi: agricultural policy is stuck on boosting the incomes of rice and wheat producers, though there is a big storage problem for these two crops and a growing preference among consumers away from these and towards non-cereals, notes the union governmentâ€™s economic survey for 2001-02. it says this is a â€˜â€˜stark reminderâ€™â€™ of the need to re-do the policy towards the growth of oilseeds, pulses, fruits, vegetables and dairies â€” which requires development of â€˜rural infrastructureâ€™. meaning, roads, transport, god and reliable electricity, watershed management, cold storages, food processing facilities, quality-test labs, markets, etc. and, it adds, removal of legal clamps on trade and storage. minimum support prices are only encouraging rice and wheat growers, at the expense of others, the survey says. what is needed is â€˜â€˜fresh policy focusâ€™â€™, meaning that the existing policy is outdated, counter-productive and stuck. finally bowing to what anti-statist have been arguing for decades, the survey says neither farmer, nor consumer is benefiting from the control orders and the compulsory levies. the february 5 order of the union government, to remove clamps on trade, movement and stock-limits on a number of crops and products is, it says, the start of an â€˜â€˜epoch making reform process...it is for state governments to vigorously pursue reforms in other areasâ€™â€™. the market is still unfree, it notes, for producers of paddy, cotton and sugarcane. rice, wheat and sugar stocks are far more than the country has any possibility of using. nor are prices being allowed to be set by the market, to the countryâ€™s detriment. rice, wheat, tea, coffee and oils all suffer from the erratic or stagnating export growth; part of the cause is artificially-set prices in the domestic market. and export infrastructure on agro-products is weak. all these represent wasted opportunities, with the opening of world trade in this sector. india has automatic competitive advantages in many products: low labour costs, diverse agro- climatic conditions, enough inputs. a year after, the government is still mulling the expenditure reforms commissionâ€™s recommendations to phase out subsidies on urea â€” the most preferred fertiliser â€” completely over five years, starting in early 2001. the fertiliser industry and many state governments donâ€™t like the suggested measures, says the government.

12,Govt will take action to maintain law&order: Advani,"new delhi: concerned over assembly of thousands of kar sevaks in ayodhya, home minister l k advani on wednesday said the exercise could lead to flagrant defiance of court orders and warned the vhp that government would not not hesitate to take action to maintain law and order. the vhp has ""embarked on a course of action in ayodhya which is fraught with dangerous consequences. thousands are sought to be assembled in ayodhya to take part in a mass exercise which can only lead to flagrant defiance of the court orders,"" he said in a terse statement a day after the all-party meeting convened by prime minister atal bihari vajpayee to discuss the temple issue. asking vhp leaders, particularly ashok singhal, to abandon their present course of action, advani said, ""if, however, they persist in their present approach, the government would not not hesitate to take action against those who defy court orders or create problems for law and order"". asserting that it was duty of centre as well as the uttar pradesh government to ensure that court orders were not not violated by anyone, the home minister said the developments in ayodhya could, thus, precipitate a serious law and order problem. ""crores of our countrymen want the ram temple to be built at ayodhya but they want it to be built lawfully and peacefully,"" he said. maintaining that as a person he has always felt proud of his association with the ayodhya movement, advani said, ""i feel that what the vhp is currently engaged in can only cause damage to the great movement."" the home minister said that government was ""very correct"" in holding that in the present context, the temple issue could be solved either by agreement among the parties concerned or by a judicial verdict. ""it certainly cannot be achieved by a confrontation,"" he asserted. advani also appealed to hindu and muslim religious leaders to initiate a dialogue to sort out the ayodhya issue. ""the country would be happy if the matter is resolved by an agreement between the two communities,"" he added.

""the results are indeed very surprising. but i think we lost ground mainly because of our over-confidence. we had presumed that bjp is winning handsdown,"" he said.

""block all access routes from karsevekpuram to the acquired area and seal all stocks of carved pillars against their use in an unlawful act,"" the organisations said.

21,Cong to target govt in budget session,"ahmedabad: super-charged by the thumping victory over bjp in two of the three seats where by-elections were held, the congress party is all set to finally flex its muscles as opposition and give some tough time to chief minister narendra modi in the assembly session beginning on tuesday. at a meeting with mediapesons on monday, leader of opposition in the assembly naresh raval gave clear indications of the fire-works that await bjp when the assembly meets on tuesday for the budget session. ""we will take the state government to task on the burning issues that stare the state in the face. we have had enough of the cm dishing out hollow promises to the people through an unprecedented 4,000 advertisements. it is time to come clean and explain what the government has actually achieved,"" said raval. corruption in quake-rehabilitation, delay in completion of narmada project, unprecedented industrial recession in the state, scams that derailed the co-operative banking movement in the state and detailed discussion of the comptroller of audit general (cag) report are some of the issues on which the congress is itching to grill the bjp government. indications are that the congress will also demand the government to issue a white-paper on the financial health of the state which, it alleged, was serious as there have been directives not to clear bills upwards of rs 1 lakh. interestingly here when the congress has finally donned the mantle to play its part as a real opposition party, it is complaining that the assembly session this time is too short! ""they have deliberately announced a session of only 22 working days, as against the traditional session of 35 days of which the budget itself will consume 18 days. modi apparently knows what is in store for him and so has deliberately curtailed the session,"" said gpcc chief amarsinh chaudhary. chaudhary felt that the short session was a violation of the constitutional right of mlas who will be deprived of adequate time to ask questions and debate controversial bills, the common universities act, the co-operatives act and a ''poto-like bill'' that is likely to be presented in the session. ""i have written a letter to narendra modi urging him that the duration of the session be increased to do justice to various issues concerning the state, but have received no response so far, which of course does not augur well for the cm. we are not going to take things lying down anymore,"" said raval.

22,"Civic polls: Next battle for Cong, BJP","gandhinagar: fresh from a skirmish in the three by-elections in the state where they shared the honours, there is another battleground awaiting the bjp and the congress in gujarat. after its defeat in the by-elections to two of the three assembly constituencies, the ruling bjp faces another acid test as the state election commission has decided to hold elections to 86 municipalities in 21 districts on march 31. the municipality elections will give one more opportunity to the two major political players to test their strengths before the assembly elections which are one year away. the municipal elections have been postponed on earlier occasions on account of the drought and earthquake. however, late last year, the state government agreed to hold the elections to the gram panchayats and tried its best to evolve consensus, instead of elections, by offering the lucrative ''samras'' package. which party won the gram panchayat elections is still not clear as the candidates did not fight on party symbols. however, these 86 municipalities will see a direct confrontation between bjp and congress candidates. already, there are signs of the bjp''s hold over both the rural and urban electorate weakening - amply reflected in the recent by-elections when it could only hold on to rajkot-2 and that too because it had the chief minister as candidate. the bjp had earlier lost the sabarkantha and sabarmati by-elections which forced a change in leadership in gujarat and it had to also abdicate power in favour of the congress in the elections to the municipal corporations of ahmedabad and rajkot which were considered its bastions. state election commissioner p j dholakia said the by-election of 18 seats and that of one seat of ahmedabad municipal corporation would be also conducted along with election to 2,064 seats of 688 wards of municipalities. electronic voting machines would be used for the first time in urban centres like memnagar, valsad, dhoraji and vadnagar. as per the programme announced by the commission the general notice for the civic polls will be published on march 4. the commission has fixed march 11 as the last date for filing of nomination. the papers will be scrutinised on march 13 while last day for withdrawal will be march 15. polling will be held on march 31. the election to 15 taluka panchayats, including that of gandhinagar taluka panchayat and that of banaskantha and kheda will be announced soon.
