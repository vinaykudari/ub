1,Council loses order over question of law-and-order,"lucknow: unruly scenes were witnessed in the vidhan parishad on wednesday with the samajwadi party members staging a walkout over the deteriorating law-and-order situation and the rising crime graph in the state. the issue was raised through separate adjournment notices by the opposition members, who demanded the suspension of proceedings and the holding of a debate. members were clear that the life and property of the people was not safe and the police had failed in their task of infusing a sense of security among the people by nabbing the culprits. opposition members, led by bhagwati singh, ram asrey vishwakarma (samajwadi party), sukhdev rajbhar (bsp) and sarv shakti singh (congress), drew the attention of the chair to the recent murder of a doctor couple in gomti nagar area of the state capital and three other similar incidents in the recent past. they said, the police were unable to solve the cases and had found a convenient excuse of holding the kachha baniyan gang responsible for every incident. leader of the opposition, ahmed hasan, said that in recent past, five doctors had been killed in the state capital and the medical fraternity was now living in a state of constant fear. ""every minute, two murders were being committed in uttar pradesh and the police were proving helpless,"" he said, adding ""a jungle raj has now been established in up and the government should be dismissed immediately."" sp state president ram sharan das demanded the deployment of the army to prevent the situation from going out of control. a complete chaos broke out when leader of the house lalji tandon stood up to reply and, without naming the samajwadi party, stated in his opening sentence that crime had increased ever since `resignations' took place. hearing this, the sp members were up on their feet, demanding that tandon should take his statement back. what followed next was a free trading of charges and counter-charges between the opposition and treasury benches. the situation worsened when avadh pal yadav of the bjp said the crime graph was bound to go up as dacoits like chabbi ram of the sp had resigned from the house. attempts of the chair to maintain order proved futile. later, continuing with his speech, tandon said a differentiation would have to be made between a `break-down of law-and-order situation' and `everyday crime'. in a city with a population of 30 lakhs, three-four such murders could not be interpreted as a breakdown of the law and order machinery, he explained, adding that the cases were being worked out. however, when he began praising the chief minister and talked about `some people trying to incite communal violence', the sp members vehemently objected to it and ultimately staged a walk-out. later in his ruling, acting chairman om prakash sharma directed that the government should make a statement in the house.

5,SIMI has now become explicitly political,"new delhi: founded in april, 1977, in aligarh, the students islamic movement of india (simi) was allegedly linked to jamaat-e-islami hind, which played a dominant role in its formation and initial growth. throughout most of the '80s and '90s, simi had a low profile, limiting itself to educational and proselytising activities on the fringe of the muslim community. it's core belief is that only islam can provide the solution to india's problems. in recent years - and especially after the demolition of the babri masjid in 1992 - it has begun to be more explicitly political. according to simi's website, the organisation believes in educational reform so that there are ""equal opportunities for education to enable members of all sections of the society to get education"". state interference in the system should be minimized and that primary education should be imparted in every region's mother-tongue. simi members are urged not to take up jobs in any field ""which are openly in confrontation with the islamic shariah"". the website notes that simi considers the parliamentary system of elections to be ""useless and futile"" for the purposes of bringing ""islamic revolution"" in india. ""it is difficult to keep the islamic revolutionary character during the process of election. therefore simi will not participate in the election and will not give votes to anybody,"" it says. on the question of communal violence, simi says that riots are caused both by ""misunderstanding about islam and muslims"" and as a ""calculated plan against islam and muslims"". in order to deal with the problem in the long-term, simi says it will ""invite all the sections of non-muslims towards islam"". in the short-term, it says that ""all possible efforts will be made to prevent the occurrence and spreading of riots.. (by) forming peace committees"". ""if all the efforts to prevent the riots are failed then we must defend all the oppressed people and ourselves, be it muslims or non-muslims"", simi says. the home ministry notification does not charge simi and its leadership with any specific terrorist act or crime. it makes a general charge. ""simi has been indulging in activities which are prejudicial to the security of the country and disrupting the secular fabric of the country,"" the notification says. again without going into details it says simi was in ""close touch with militant outfits and is supporting extremism/militancy in punjab and jammu and kashmir and elsewhere...and is thus questioning the territorial integrity of india"". the third charge listed is as curious as it is terse: ""it is working for an international islamic order."" the fourth charge is that during ikhwan conferences in november last year, simi leaders ""glorified pan-islamic fundamentalism, used derogatory language for deities of other religions, and exhorted muslims for jehad."" the last two charges were that simi published ""objectionable posters and literature"", incited communal feelings and engineered ""communal riots and disruptive activities"". in a separate backgrounder, the mha alleged that the outfit was involved in 14 cases of the terrorist violence, which had caused 15 deaths and injury to 80 others in up and delhi in 2000-2001 and that there was a ""a deep nexus between simi and hizb-ul-mujahideen"". it also claimed that simi had links with pro-hamas students organisations. another charge listed was the simi hand in protests against alleged burning of the qoran in delhi and elsewhere which led to communal tensions and riots. and more recently, the mha claims, simi activists were found distributing pro-taliban leaflets and pamphlets in delhi and other major cities.

6,Judicial panel to probe Muzaffarpur incident,"patna: the state government has ordered a judicial probe into the muzaffarpur episode that claimed seven lives during the public outcry on wednesday over the kidnapping and subsequent murder of a four-year-old son of a bank employee. the announcement was made by water resources minister jagadanand singh both in the state assembly and legislative council on thursday, even as the entire opposition staged walkouts in both the houses. however, singh did not give any time frame for the judicial inquiry. nor did he indicate when the commission would be constituted. singh said of the seven deaths reported, six people were killed in police firing and 19 other persons were injured. he attributed the violent flare-up in the strife-torn town to a rumour that the slain child's parents had committed suicide. a high-level team from the police headquarters has already gone to muzaffarpur to probe the episode, he said, and claimed that the town had turned normal, except for a couple of stray incidents. meanwhile, the state assembly remained in turmoil for the second consecutive day as a determined opposition stalled the functioning of the house by storming into its well raising slogans like lathi goli ki sarkar nahin chalegi, nahin chalegi . the speaker adjourned the house thrice, with each session lasting for just about five minutes. around 4.40 pm, the situation took a dramatic turn as the treasury benches pushed through the business by getting the supplementary budget of around rs 356 crore passed amidst slogan shouting and walkout by the opposition. it also managed to get five bills passed after which parliamentary affairs minister ram chandra purbey pleaded with speaker sadanand singh to adjourn the house sine-die blaming the opposition of not allowing the house to function. the speaker accepted the plea and adjourned the house sine die a day ahead of schedule. the muzaffarpur incident also rocked the legislative council on thursday as national democratic alliance (nda) members created an uproar following which it was adjourned within half an hour. as soon as the members met, nda members, during the pre-lunch session, demanded the government's reply on the latest situation on the muzaffarpur incident suspending special debates on drought and flood situation as well as problems of migrant labourers. the opposition members trooped to the well shouting slogans like lathi goli ki sarkar nahi chalegi and disturbed the proceedings. parliamentary affairs minister purbe, while trying to calm them, said the situation was returning to normal. the entire administration is busy in tackling the situation, he said. despite repeated requests, they refused to return to their seats following which chairman jabir hussain adjourned the house. in between, the ruling party and its allies also entered the well and started indulging in counter-allegations. the scheduled business could be taken up only after the house met for the question-hour session.

7,Govt may bend laws to prevent broken homes from shrinking,"ahmedabad: dhiren bhatt and his eight neighbours in the now-collapsed parth apartment in gulbai tekra had three-bedroom flats, each measuring 133 square yard. when parth residents presented their reconstruction plans they were told that the legally the plan would have to be restricted to 55 square yard flats. the residents of parth are among the scores of residents of buildings that collapsed in the january 26 earthquake who are now finding that reconstruction would mean living in much smaller homes. the collapsed buildings had illegal extensions which are not being allowed under the new stricter rules imposed after the earthquake. think-tank of the ahmedabad municipal corporation is hard at work these days. the corporation's administrators are going through the grind trying to stop broken city homes from shrinking in the post-quake reconstruction scenario. no less than 69 complaints are with the amc that speak of irregularities practised by builders and developers. in some cases the fsi has been increased or that extra storey has come up on a low-rise or a pent-house added to a 10-storeyed high-rise. while in others the cantilever portion of a building has been extended illegally for more space without column or beam support and without amc's permission. though the civic body's recommendations, which have been called for by the state government to resolve these cases, will differ on a case-to-case basis, the civic authorities have decided to suggest that minor illegalities be allowed to remain when broken homes are reconstructed. till thursday, corporation authorities were busy holding discussions with individual house owners and discussing the pros and cons on reconstruction of their broken homes keeping the stringent general development control regulations (gdcr) in mind. ""we spoke to the builder-developer community at the outset but dialogues with owners are proving to be fruitful as the latter is prepared to adjust. and, the corporation too is ready to take that extra step towards a humane reconciliation. since other building illegalities are being regularised through levy of impact fee, it is only just that a suitable solution be there for those whose homes were destroyed by the earthquake,"" said a senior official in amc. so, that extra elbow room that you had in your dream home may still be there when the new house comes up but fate of that penthouse or that illegal storey or commercial establishments in place of parking lots may be doomed. residents of shitalbaug apartment in paldi, which collapsed killing seven residents, had to actually buy out some residents to get more space. the flat was built at a time when fsi ceiling was 1.1 but the builder somehow managed an fsi of 2. sanctioned for 96 square metres, on completion the building covered 120 square metres. shitalbaug had 16 flats but the new gdcr allows only 11. ""so we paid back rs 5.25 lakh to each of the remaining five families. now we are faced with reconstruction cost of rs 4,500 per square yard,"" lamented a shitalbaug resident. the state minister for urban development, parmanand khattar told tnn that section 29 (2) of the town planning act empowers the state government to set aside certain rules of the gdcr in special circumstances. of the 69 collapsed-building cases in ahmedabad, studies and recommendations on 46 have reached the urban development department from the municipal commissioner's office. violations of building bylaws and deviations in fsi and original plans are being considered. ""a suitable, humane solution to this impasse will soon be evolved so that reconstruction of the crumbled multi-storeys, with as little changes to its original structure as possible, can start,"" the minister said.

10,Two Congress men suspended for anti-party activities,"ahmedabad: soon after the election wins, trouble has begun to brew in the gujarat congress with all-india congress committee member irshadbaig mirza alleging that gujarat pradesh congress committee amarsinh chaudhary was ""out to ruin his career"". in the city, two congress workers , vishnu patel and op sharma, from sabarmati, have been suspended from the party for anti-party activities. mirza was reacting to chaudhary's statement in an interview accusing mirza of foisting candidates from the minorities in the sabarkantha parliamentary constituency to divide the votebank in the by-polls that concluded recently. chaudhary had also stated that he would bring mirza's dissidence before the congress high command, which seems to have put the aicc leader on a sticky wicket. when contacted on wednesday evening, chaudhary completely denied the report and told tnn, ""i have never made such allegations; it is totally baseless"". he, however confirmed that he had suspended patel and sharma for anti-campaigns in the sabarmati assembly constituency. incidentally, three independent candidates from the minority group cornered at least 43,000 votes in sabarkantha which the party believes are of the minorities and might have given a bigger margin to the congress. this has led the party to do a lot of introspection. mirza stated that he had campaigned for the party in all possible segments of sabarkantha and had no hand in diverting minority votes. meanwhile, the changing political scenario in the state is expected to have the congress buy more time on appointing the congress legislature party leader, say sources. with rumours that the bjp high command might have a change of guard, the congress high command, which was to announce the clp leader for gujarat soon, may wait a while. now that narhari amin is in the state assembly, there are possibilities that he might take over the clp mantle from chaudhary.

""the general maxim prevailing regarding the polls is that a candidate who gets the highest number of voters registered is likely to win. it is expected that the candidates registered for him would vote him as well. the high rush for registrations can be attributed to this fact,"" said a candidate. veterans who have been contesting the polls for several years now have for the first time faced challenge from new entrants. old timers like jb rajput, narendra parmar, pravin jani and dr prakash shah are likely to face stiff competition from new entrants. first timers in the polls include narendra rawat in the faculty of technology and engineering, dr rajesh chauhan in medicine faculty and dipak shah in faculty of social work. the highest number of aspirants, however, are in the faculty of arts. as many as four candidates have got their voters registered in the arts faculty. these include pravin jani, dinesh yadav, liyakatali saiyed and raisinh dahima. the exceptionally high number of registrations in the arts faculty is attributed to the large number of candidates there. according to university officials, the polls will be held in december this year along with those for other categories of the senate. while the candidatures are yet to be filed, those eyeing the posts have already started canvassing for the various posts.
