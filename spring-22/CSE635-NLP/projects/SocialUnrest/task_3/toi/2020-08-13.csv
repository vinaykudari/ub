1,JD (S) leader attacks govt on Coke issue,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Janata Dal (S) leader and former Union Minister M P Veerendra Kumar has come down heavily on the A K Antony government accusing it of ""inaction"" against the Coca-Cola plant at Plachimada despite lab tests allegedly showing solid waste thrown up by the plant containing toxic material.

In an ''open letter'' to Chief Minister A K Antony, Veerendra Kumar wanted the government to take steps for closure of the plant, seize the products and get compensation for the farmers in the area who suffered due to pollution caused by the plant.

The struggle against the plant was launched by the poor tribals in the area against depletion of groundwater. The government had only sought to break the struggle, by treating the agitators as if they were extremists, he said in his letter carried by Mathrubhumi daily.

When the Perumatti Panchayat, where the plant is located, cancelled the unit''s licence, the government did not only refuse to extend any support to the local body but acted as if it was bound to sabotage the panchayat''s decisions, he said.

The JD (S) leader also took exception to statements from Finance Minister K Sanakaranayanan and Local Administration Minister Cherkalam Abdulla attributing political motives to the struggle.

3,3 ministers to go on foreign tour despite ban,"HYDERABAD: Cocking snook at the government order banning foreign tours, couple of senior cabinet ministers succeeded in obtaining permission from chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu to go abroad.

Fed up with the frequent foreign jaunts by ministers, officials and non-officials, the chief minister has instructed chief secretary Mohan Kanda not to allow any one to go on a foreign tour for a period of one year. However, the order has one escape route that allowed foreign tours â€œwhich are in the interests of the state.â€�

Finance minister Y Ramakrishnudu, major industries minister K Vidhyader Rao and couple of officials will visit Germany and Zurich and are also likely to pay a visit to a car manufacturing facility.

According to highly-placed sources, the general administration department had shot down the tour proposal, but the chief secretary had okayed it. Even the chief minister also consented to the ministersâ€™ tour. Sources said Vidhyader Rao has reportedly made over 20 foreign trips during the last two years.

Another senior minister N Janardhan Reddy also got clearance from the chief minister for his visit to Australia.

The minister is going abroad along with his department officials. Janardhan Reddy has taken the tour file directly to the chief minister and obtained his approval bypassing all established norms.

4,OGH gets technicians to repair equipments,"HYDERABAD: The Osmania General Hospital has managed to get technicians from abroad as well as the state to repair 75 of the 450 equipments procured through the Japanese International Coordination Agency (JICA).

In all the OGH had received 450 medical equipments through a grant given by the Japanese International Coordination Agency. But these equipments were not being used for the past couple of years as spare parts were not available and some medical equipments needed to be repaired.

According to hospital superintendent Dr T Laxminarayana, the OGH has requested for 75 of these medical equipments to be repaired in order to improve the medical services that are being provided to patients coming to the hospital.

The work would be completed by the end of September and the machines installed soon after, Dr Laxminarayana said.

The hospital superintendent said that the OGH was also planning to enter into a contract with the local authorised agents of these machines for maintenance and supply of parts so as to ensure that there were no further glitches in the functioning of these equipments.

5,Noose tightens around ex-minister,"GAYA: The noose has further tightened around former minister and RJD strongman Surendra Prasad Yadav and he is likely to be charge sheeted soon in the Atul Prakash custodial kidnapping case in which the Anand (Gujarat)-based businessman was allegedly kidnapped during police custody and tortured at the Gaya residence of the former minister.

Surendra Yadav is in judicial custody for the last two and a half months. Three policemen, including SI Rama Kant Ram, have already been charge sheeted in the same case registered as case no. 34/2003 in the Rampur police station of Gaya town.

According to sources in the police department, the investigators have gathered sufficient evidence against the former minister and the charge sheet is likely to be submitted in the court of the chief judicial magistrate.

The sources further said that the Gaya police are proceeding to keep the August 30 deadline for the submission of the charge sheet. If the police fail to submit the charge sheet before August 30, 2003, the former minister would automatically be entitled to bail.

The DGP has personally assured the Patna High Court that effective steps were being taken and the accused will not be allowed to get any benefit on account of police laxity.

Legal experts say that Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code clearly says that an accused would automatically be entitled to bail if the charge sheet is not submitted within 90 days of the judicial custody of the accused.

6,Of coalition and clash of interests,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawati may continue to head the government with the Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s support, but the strategy chalked out by the Bahujan Samaj Party for the coming parliamentary elections runs counter to the BJPâ€™s Mission 2004.

If the strategy of the BSP is put into action, the dalit outfit will like to contest 50 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh, leaving 30 for the BJP. In case the vidhan sabha polls are tagged with the Lok Sabha polls, the BSP in any case will like to contest 250 of the 403 seats.

This will leave a little over 150 seats for the BJP, according to a prominent BJP leader. Known for her bargaining ability, the chief minister had worked out a strategy which would leave her alliance partner with no option but to grab the bait offered to them by the BSP, said a BSP leader.

But in case the Lok Sabha and the vidhan sabha polls are held separately, the BSP may not like to slide down its target of contesting 50 Lok Sabha seats from the state, said a BSP leader.

This will virtually make it impossible for the BJP to achieve its Mission 2004 whereby it has kept a target of winning over 300 Lok Sabha seats on its own, and 350 seats with alliance partners. If the BJP did not win a sizable number of seats in Uttar Pradesh, its ambition of crossing 300 mark at the Centre would remain a dream, felt many political analysts.

Outright refusal by the BJP to accept the bait of the BSP would not only alienate the dalit outfit which might put up candidates in the states going to the polls in such a way as to mar the prospects of the BJP in those states, hinted a BSP leader.

By the end of this year, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Chhatisgarh will go to the polls along with Mizoram. In all the states barring Mizoram, the BSP may take a slice of the BJP or the Congress votes. This could tilt the balance at the time of the polls, felt many.

To shore up the prospects of its candidates in the polls, the BSP might drop many sitting MPs and MLAs, said a party leader. This would, among other things, effectively counter the effects of anti-incumbency factor to some extent, said a party leader.

7,DGP orders arrest of Siwan public prosecutor,"PATNA: State DGP D P Ojha on Wednesday ordered for the arrest of Siwan public prosecutor (PP) Bipendra Kumar Verma in connection with the killing of a noted lawyer of the same town, Raghuvir Sharan Verma, on April 28, 2000.

In the FIR lodged in this connection with the Siwan town police station, Bipendra and three others had been named as main accused. Bipendra is said to be one of the close aides of RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, police sources said.

The DGP directed the Siwan SP and Special Task Force chief to cooperate in executing the arrest order. At present, the CID is probing this case.

On April 28, 2000, armed criminals attacked Raghuvir Sharan Vermaâ€™s residence near the Siwan court and shot him dead on the spot. His wife Madhu Verma, who was seriously injured in the incident, was declared dead on way to Patna.

In her dying declaration which was later turned into an FIR, she had named Bipendra, Abhishek Srivastava alias Ball, Abhay Pande and Shahnawaz Dono as accused. Non-bailable warrants have already been issued against them. A chargesheet has also been submitted against six persons in this connection.

According to the police, Amit, son of slain Raghuvir Sharan Verma, had moved the Supreme Court for the transfer of the case outside the state in view of the threat perception.

At present, the hearing of this case is going on in the fast-track district court at Ranchi. On the Supreme Court orders, Raghuvir Sharan Vermaâ€™s surviving family members were given security cover.

According to family sources, the slain lawyerâ€™s another school-going son Sumit Harshvardhan had been killed in the Siwan market allegedly by the aides of Shahabuddin on September 5, 1998.

An FIR in this connection was lodged at Siwan in which three persons â€” Raju alias Thakur Ujjwal Kumar, Thakur Singheshwar Kumar alias Chhote and Mohammad Guddu â€” were named as accused.

Raghuvir Sharan Verma was himself looking after this case. According to his family sources, Madhu Verma, in her dying declaration, said that Bipendra had threatened him not to pursue the case of his sonâ€™s murder.

On April 28, 2000, when the bail petition in the case of his sonâ€™s murder was to be heard, criminals attacked Raghuvir Sharan Vermaâ€™s residence at Siwan in the evening, killing him and his wife.

8,Police inspector dies of cardiac arrest on duty,"SURAT: A circle police inspector died of cardiac arrest while trying to control an agitated mob of farmers near Kosamba taluka in Surat district.

Police inspector N P Sarvaiyya and his team had stopped a mob of around 4,000 farmers from going to Bharuch to hold a rally against the hike in power tariff in the farm sector. Angry at being blocked, the farmers started pelting stones near Damrod village on national highway number eight at around 10 am.

To disperse the mob, the police resorted to lathi-charge when Sarvaiyya suffered a cardiac arrest. He was rushed to a hospital at Anklewshwar where he was declared brought dead. ""So far, we have not made any arrests,"" said Surat (rural) district superintendent of police D J Patel. ""The mob was very agitated but we managed to disperse them.""

Incidents of rioting by farmers and attempts to block traffic on the busy national highway were also reported from Navsari. ""We have arrested about 15 people and detained around 200,"" said Navsari DSP A K Jadeja. ""Groups of around 200 people have tried to block the highway with a rasta roko agitation but we are trying to disperse them.""

Transporters on the other hand are saying they are already facing disruptions. ""We are facing a lot of trouble in moving our trucks as the farmers are not allowing them to move ahead,"" said Rakesh Bhalja of the South Gujarat Transporters Association.

9,Gujarat govt to stop leak of info to media,"GANDHINAGAR: The Cabinet unit of the Gujarat government on Wednesday sent across a confidential note to all secretaries, telling them that they should keep a close watch on the officials leaking out information to the media. ""The issue was discussed and formalised at a recent Cabinet meeting headed by chief minister Narendra Modi"", revealed a senior bureaucrat.

The one-page note is learnt to have told government secretaries that a lot of internal information on government thinking on various issues is leaked out before it is formalised. Pointing out that this should not happen, the note is said to suggest strict action against those officials seeking to leak information to media before it is officially made known.

Earlier, state education minister Anandiben Patel, known for her ideological closeness to the CM, issued a note to the officials of her department suggesting they refrain from coming in direct contact with mediapersons. She insisted in the note that any news found to be uncomfortable to her department''s working be not just replies but even court notice be issues.

Commented a top bureaucrat in the chief minister''s office (CMO), ""We think that only the state information department is authorised to give news on the working of the government, no one else... We do not think that the mediapersons should know what''s happening in the government more than what they are told. Why should media be interested in knowing, for instance, what transpires between the CM and the members of Parliament.""

Significantly, the state government decision to tighten its grip on the media comes amidst the Central government telling each state to come up with rules providing the right to information to the common public. Based on the Freedom of Information Act, 2003, passed in Parliament in January, there is, however, still no movement in Gujarat on the issue, even as several other states have started moving in that direction.

10,SC rules in favour of women in Hindu Succession Act,"NEW DELHI: Setting at rest the long drawn controversy over inheritance of the property belonging to a Hindu married woman who dies intestate or issueless, the Supreme Court has ruled her husband or father in law would have no claim over it if she had acquired such a estate from her mother side.

In a ruling of utmost importance to a large number of married Hindu women''s rights in their parents'' properties, the Supreme Court said that such cases were covered by section 15(2) (a) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The provision relates to the rules of succession in the case of female Hindus.

The relevant section envisages: ""any property inherited by a female Hindu from her father or mother shall devolve, in the absence of any son or daughter of the deceased (including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) not upon the other heirs but upon the heirs of the father"".

The term ""other heirs"" specified in section 15(1)(a) of the Act says the property of a female Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the rule specified in section 16 of the Act. First, the property would devolve upon the sons and the daughters (including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) and also the husband ( her''s ).

Thus, the court explained that if a Hindu female inherited property from her father or mother, neither her husband or his heirs would get such property but it would revert to the heirs of her''s father or mother.

The judgment is a fall out of a 30-year dispute over inheritance of some properties left by one Rajathiammal who died intestate and issueless. She got the movable and immovable properties from her maternal aunt''s side as her own mother had died.

She inherited from her mother. Her father Venugopal Chettiar''s children or her own brothers through his first and second marriages made claim on the properties left behind by their married sister who died without leaving a will and issueless.

They lost before Cuddalore trial court in Andhra Pradesh and later the high court. A Supreme Court Bench of Justices M B Shah and Dr A R Lakshmanan however set aside the judgments and held since Rajathiammal had inherited the property from her mother, section 15(2) of the Act would be applicable in this case.

Therefore, the properties acquired by her from her mother would go the heirs of her father and, therefore, her sisters and brothers who are the sons and daughters of Chettiar would be entitled to her estate.

The court said section 16 of the Act ""evolves a new and uniform order of succession of property (by a female Hindu) and regulates the manner of its distribution"".

Section 15(2) also carves out an exception in cases of a female dying without leaving a will (intestate) and issueless or children of a pre-deceased son or daughter. In such a case, the rule prescribed is to find out the source from which she has inherited the property.

If it is inherited from her father or mother, the apex court explained, it would devolve under section 15(2)(a) of the Hindu Succession Act. If it is inherited from her husband or father-in-law, it would devolve upon the heirs of her husband as specified under section 15(2)(b).

The provision says that in a case where the property is inherited by a female from her father or mother, it would devolve upon the other heirs but of her father.

This would mean that if there is no son or daughter including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter, then the property would devolve upon the heirs of her father, the court said, adding: ""The result would be, if property is inherited by a female from her father or her mother, neither her husband or his heirs would get such property, but it would revert back to the heirs of her father.

11,India rejects US-EU WTO proposals on farm trade,"DELHI: India has rejected the latest farm trade proposals presented by the European Union and the US at the WTO talks to liberalise world agriculture trade. ""The proposals are not acceptable to India"", Commerce and industry minister Arun Jaitley said here on Thursday.

India will be presenting its detailed reaction to the latest EU-US farm trade proposals to the WTO in Geneva later on Thursday. The two world trade majors, earlier divided over the issues of cutting domestic and export subsidies and lowering tariffs on farm goods, reportedly reached a compromise agreement on Tuesday.

Under the EU-US agreement, export and domestic subsidies that the two major trading entities provide to their farmers would not be cut substantially, but there will be deep across the board reduction in farm tariffs.

India''s concerns at the WTO farm trade talks have been two-fold: one, it wants to protect income, welfare and jobs of 650 million people who are dependent on agriculture and two, it wants developed countries such as the EU and the US to cut the huge subsidies that they provide to their farmers.

This would enable the Indian farmer to be export competitive. ""Protecting the interests of our farmers is our priority"", Jaitley said. ""We cannot give the farmers the kind of (trade distorting) subsidies that the developed countries are giving and, therefore, they must reduce and thereafter, eliminate these subsidies. Secondly, we have to give reasonable tariff protection to our farmers. We also need additional tariff protection for sensitive items and special safeguards to stop a surge in imports"", he said.

12,New admission rules for colleges,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka government on Thursday decided to cancel the admission process for medical, dental and engineering courses held so far and reconduct the process afresh, with the Supreme Court fixing 50-50 seat sharing formula between the state government and the management in all unaided private professional colleges for 2003-2004.

The Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell had completed the admission process for medical and dental courses for both Karnataka and non-Karnataka quota candidates, engineering courses for non-Karnataka quota candidates. It was mid-way through the selection process for engineering courses for Karnataka candidates.

The admissions were being conducted on the basis of the Karnataka high court''s order that stipulated 75:25 per cent seat sharing formula between the government and managements. ""We have decided to cancel the seat selection process conducted so far and reconduct admissions. A decision on when the fresh process would begin will be taken after receiving a copy of the SC''s order,"" higher education secretary K P Pandey told The Times of India.

Karnataka has about 2,452 medical seats, 1,625 dental seats and 31,113 engineering seats. A total of 1,31,212 candidates -- 75,663 Karnataka candidates and 55,549 non-Karnataka candidates -- applied for the examination and 1,07,935 -- 73,417 Karnataka candidates and 34,518 non-Karnataka candidates -- appeared for the examination.

Of the 77,399 candidates who were assigned ranks, 43,056 were Karnataka candidates and 34,343 were non-Karantaka candidates.

13,Common law can not be implemented: Governor,"PUNE: State governor Mohammed Fazal on Thursday observed that it would be impossible to implement the common civil code right now and that the government should focus on the more pressing problems confronting the country.

Speaking to reporters at the Raj Bhavan, Fazal felt that the gov-ernment should not lay emphasis on implementation of common civil code when there were more pressing problems.

These changes would come about gradually and the need of the hour was to create awareness among people and educate them, he said. One does not commonly come across Muslims who have four wives, he remarked. He pointed out that Islam was the first religion which gave right to property to women.

On the issue of regional backlogs in the state, Fazal stated that he would convene a meeting of minister for finance, planning, chair-men of the statutory development boards and the chief minister be-fore Divali to thrash out the issue of developmental backlog of backward regions.

The cost of living is increasing everyday so the backlog is likely to remain, he observed adding that the aim should not be to extract money on the issue of development but to see what can be achieved in the given budget.

Describing corruption as one of the pressing problems, the gover-nor said that efforts should be made prevent corruption of highest level rather than concentrating on catching the â€œsmaller fliesâ€� or the â€œRs 200 type of corruptionâ€�. He said that even death penalty can be considered to punish those who were draining almost 40 per cent of the economy by indulging in corruption.

â€œA lot of bad money is floating in the society due to corruption and one has to check its sourceâ€�, he said adding that it was not just bu-reaucracy which was corrupt. The malady has spread to every as-pect of life and obstructs development, he felt.

Answering a question about rising cost of higher education and profiteering of educational institutions, Fazal said that the govern-ment needed to sit down and fix the fees on the basis of capital cost of colleges and small profit.

""The fee structure could be reviewed every five years but there should be no profiteeringâ€�, he said. â€œOne should also look at how one can reduce the capital cost of col-legesâ€�, he suggested.

Calling for judicious house keeping by the state government, the governor said that the thrust should be on completing all projects without any cost and time over-runs. He felt that the governor''s office should be involved in the process of making the budget and the state annual plan.

14,Pooja and politics take centrestage in Patan,"PATAN: Groups of people carrying burning torches took out a procession on Thursday evening heading towards the Sahastralinga lake in this town, which is the focus of Independence Day celebrations this year, as the Congress and BJP headed for a showdown on the big day.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to consecrate a Shivlinga at the spot later in the evening as almost the entire officialdom from Gandhinagar descended on this medieval capital of Gujarat which has been decked up for the grand occasion.

Nagjibhai Patni, a native of Patan who now stays in Ahmedabad, said he had come all the way just to see Patan in all its glory once again. ""This place has never looked so beautiful,"" he exulted.

As the sun set on Thursday evening, the spectacular lighting arrangements in this spruced-up town of 1.20 lakh people brought alive the ambience which Modi perhaps wanted to create for an evening packed with cultural programmes, but the thoughts of many BJP leaders were wandering off to the events of Thursday which could provide an embarassment for the chief minister.

After mediation efforts failed to persuade the Congress to call off its parallel I-Day programme, the district administration was finally compelled to grant permission to the main opposition party to hoist the national tricolour at Junaganj Bazaar area on Thursday morning.

Not only has the Congress invited Modi''s bitter critic and father of the slain minister Haren Pandya to hoist the flag, it has also announced that Vitthalbhai Pandya will be the only speaker on the occasion which is designed to spoil Modi''s grand party.

The state Congress president Shankersinh Vaghela took a stroll around the Sahastralinga lake, just before Modi was to arrive at the venue, and later headed for the Junaganj Bazaar where the Congress is also having its own cultural programme on the eve of August 15.

The town, being close to the border with Pakistan, is swarming with almost 3,000 policemen and special reserve police who are concentrated around the two main venues of the festivities, looking for any signs of trouble as people dressed up in their fineries turned up at the Rankivav and Junaganj areas to witness what promises to be one of the most politicised of all celebrations since Independence.

15,Sandesh with a pinch of bacteria,"KOLKATA: The tasty sandesh, chomchom, barfi or kachagolla from the neighbourhood sweet shop contains more than you bargained for. Samples of these sweets, prepared through the cold process in confectioners around the city, have tested positive for bacteria and fungus.

Rosogollas are relatively safer due to the concentrated syrup they are dipped in.

The tests were conducted by the Federation of Consumer Associations, at the behest of the Centre, in the formerâ€™s food and water testing laboratory in Kolkata.

â€œWe have divided the city into nine zones and will be testing 1,200 samples in the next six months. In the last couple of weeks, we have tested 40 samples from the first zone. All the samples have tested positive for bacterial contamination in various degrees. Samples included those collected from some celebrated confectioners in the city,â€� said federation president Mala Banerjee.

Scientists explained how the samples had been collected and tested. â€œWe got the sweets from the shops just like any other customer and stored them in an aseptic environment. Testing revealed the vibrio bacteria responsible for cholera in many samples. Some samples also tested positive for e-coli and salmonella, which may even cause brain damage. All the samples had were contaminated,â€� said microbiologist Dr Raktim Roy.

According to the experts, the sweets were contaminated due to the unhygienic conditions under which they were prepared. The water used for the manufacture of sweets was also contaminated in most cases. Some contamination was also possible through other raw materials or during handling and storing of the sweets.

â€œThe samples tested were all prepared by hand through the cold process. Strangely, the tests also revealed yeast contamination. In all probability, the molasses used for manufacture of sweets were contaminated. Mucor was found in some samples. Some yeast strains can be toxic and quite harmful in the longer run,â€� Roy said.

According to Banerjee, prevention of contamination is only possible if sweet manufacturers go in for a mechanised process and use clean water. â€œSweets from Bengal have a great export potential but most countries back out due to the lack of any certification, guaranteeing their purity. We are seeking a BIS approval for our laboratory after which we plan to certify the purity of sweets from various outlets. The present study will be completed in around six months after which we shall send a report to the Centre,â€� she said.

The federation also plans to carry out random tests on sweets every month and publish reports. Consumers who doubt the quality of sweets they purchase can also take the samples (as soon as they are bought) to the federation for tests. Tests will also be carried out soon on junk food available through various outlets in Kolkata.

16,Dalits protest custodial death in Ahmedabad,"AHMEDABAD: A huge number of dalits gathered on the highway connecting Ahmedabad and Mehsana near Chandkheda on Thursday afternoon to protest against the custodial death of Vasant Ravji Vankar who was found dead in the Sabarmati police station.

Vankar (36), who was a resident of Chandkheda, allegedly hung himself to death after being arrested on a charge of theft earlier in the evening. But a huge group of dalits including his family members suspect he was beaten to death and refused to dispose off his body till action was not taken against the police.

His younger brother Ramesh Vankar told TNN, ""We have seen injury marks on his body and will not remove the body till they do not take action against the police."" According to him, ""we did not even know he had been picked up by the police till someone came around 11 pm to tell us that he had hung himself.""

Vankar''s body lay on a camel cart with over a thousand dalits gathered near it since 3 pm on Thursday. Chandkheda nagarpalika councillor Valji Desai who was among the demonstrators said, ""The police is trying to dispose off the case as suicide but we will not give in till a case of murder is lodged against the police and a CBI inquiry is not initiated.""

When contacted, Joint commissioner of police (sector I) P C Thakur said: ""This is a clear case of suicide and we have conducted all the formalities and even intimated the NHRC.""

According to him, ""this whole thing has been instigated by political elements since, there was nothing till Thursday morning.""

Referring to the post mortem report, Thakur was categorical in stating that it was a death due to strangulation which had been videographed and duly examined by the forensic experts.

The dalit demonstrators, however do not agree and have declared a ''Chandkheda bandh'' on Friday. They have submitted memoranda to the SP and collector of Gandhinagar, which covers the Chandkheda area and the case is with the Ahmedabad Sub-Divisional Magistrate for inquiry.

17,SC lawyer's office raided by police,"NEW DELHI: The crime branch raided a Supreme Court advocateâ€™s office on Wednesday evening. M M Kashyap, missing for the past three months, has been accused of cheating a Hyderabad-based businessman of Rs 30 lakh.

The crime branch team went to his office at 220, New Lawyersâ€™ Chamber Block in the Supreme Court, following his alleged non-cooperation. He was the advocate for Mohammad Aslam, one of the petitioners in the Ram Janm Bhoomi Trust case.

18,Debt drives family to the brink of suicide,"KOLKATA: â€œI am heavily in debt. But, I am keeping some money aside so that my driversâ€™ salaries for the month can paid.â€�

These were the last words thirtysix year-old Nilanjan Barat wrote before he, his wife Swarnali and 10-year-old daughter Sohini gulped down soft drinks laced with sleeping pills on Wednesday night. Nilanjan did not survive the attempt, his wife and child are battling for their life at a city hospital.

According to the police, Nilanjan Barat was an employee of a shipping company, besides owning a travel agency and hotels in Puri and Digha, which were in his wifeâ€™s name.

On Thursday morning, when one of Baratâ€™s drivers knocked on his flat, at Rajdanga Chakraborty Para in Kasba, there was no reply.

The driver grew suspicious and called Baratâ€™s neighbours. When they forced their way into Baratsâ€™ flat, they found Swarnali and Sohini lying unconscious in the bedroom.

Barat was lying dead in the bathroom. Sleeping pills and soft drink bottles were found alongside. Police suspect that the pills were mixed in the soft drinks.

Lately, Barat had incurred heavy losses as his business was doing badly. To tide over the losses, he sold several cars from his travel agency. He even borrowed money from money-lenders including Kabuliwallahs. On Wednesday evening, a Kabuliwallah had come to his flat demanding loan repayment.

When Barat expressed his inability to pay, he was abused. Later at night, he took a desperate step out.

According to their neighbour Maya Chatterjee, Barat returned from his brotherâ€™s house in Bangalore on Tuesday. â€œEarlier, he would regularly smoke in his balcony. Ever since he came back,we have not seen him outside the house. Since Wednesday, the house has been unusually quiet, â€� said Chatterjee.

They have been living in the flat for the last five years. Baratâ€™s mother, who suffers from epilepsy, lived in a flat next to his. On hearing of the incident, she had to be admitted to the hospital on Thursday afternoon.

According to Chatterjee, Barat had met his mother on Wednesday night and sought her blessings. â€œHe also told her not to wake them if they slept late,â€� said Chatterjee.

Barat was popular in the neighbourhood. He would donate money to clubs, local pujas or those in need, said neighbours.
