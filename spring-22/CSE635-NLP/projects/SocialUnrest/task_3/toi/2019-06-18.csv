0,Gujarat riots had bearing on Goa polls: Parrikar,"RAJKOT: Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar said here on Monday that the Godhra incident and the communal violence that followed in Gujarat did have a bearing on the Goa Assembly polls in which the Bharatiya Janata Party won with a wafer-thin majority.

Talking to reporters here before proceeding to Devgadh village,, the Goa chief minister, however, expressed the confidence that the ruling BJP would emerge victorious in the next Assembly elections in the state.

Parrikar ruled out any speculation on the longevity of the BJP ministry in Goa and said that the party would rule for the entirely five year term without any problem, despite the Congress trying to present a distorted picture of the Godhra train carnage and the subsequent violence. He said that the Congress also tried to use the caste card, but failed in Goa. ""The results were a resounding slap on the face of the Congress leadership"", he said.

The chief minister also hastened to add that there was a big difference in the situation in Goa and Gujarat, but history has proved that whenever elections are held in Gujarat, the BJP has always emerged victorious.

Parrikar also admitted that due to the Indo-Pak tension the flow of foreign tourists had slowed down, but the situation would improve as soon as the situation at the border would improve with the war clouds dispersing.

1,CM's remarks on polls stirs activity,"PALANPUR: Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s recent remark in New Delhi that the state Assembly elections may be advanced has stirred up political activity in north Gujarat, particularly within the Bharatiya Janata Party circles.

While the state unit of the party is yet to take a decision on early Assembly elections, aspirants in north Gujarat have already started lobbying for tickets.

A majority of aspirants feel that the strong ''Hindutva wave'' which has resurfaced in the state after the post-Godhra carnage would stand the party in good stead.

BJP''s Banaskantha unit president Haresh Jani said that this time the party would lay down norms for selecting candidates, including their winning capacity.

In the last Assembly elections, the BJP had secured five seats from Banaskantha, while the Congress won three. The BJP had retained the Lok Sabha seat too. However, three other Assembly seats in north Gujarat - Patan, Mehsana and Sabarkantha - went to the Congress.

The political scenario in the region, party leaders feel, is favourable for the BJP as the chief minister, though elected from Rajkot, belongs to this place and has been assiduously ''cultivating'' this region through frequent visits and attending public functions.

Party workers say that the BJP leadership should capitalise on the issue by holding early elections as the ''Hindutva'' factor may lose its charm if they are held at a later date.

BJP''s district unit president Haresh Jani too feels that the party would improve its performance in the forthcoming Assembly elections. The elevation of Narendra Modi as chief minister after a few years of political wilderness has helped the party to a large extent, he says.

However, the biggest hurdle the party faces is that too many aspirants have started lobbying for tickets. The denial of tickets may lead to infighting and spoil the chances of other party candidates.

The BJP''s ticket aspirants include sitting MLA Rekhaben Dwivedi, former minister Kantilal Kachoriya, Gujarat Agriculture University''s campus director S K Sagar, Navsari-based diamond trader Girish Jaganiya and Amrutlal Foshi.

On the other hand, political activity in the Congress camp in the region is yet to pick up momentum. The likely Congress aspirants include Raymalji Solanki, Veerjibhai Judal, Sureshbhai Patel and the sitting Congress MLA from Danta, Mukesh Gadhvi.

The Congress plans to cash in on the BJP''s ''failures'' on various fronts, but the major plank is likely to be the caste factor. The Anjana and Thakore are the dominant communities here as they account for about 39 per cent of the electorate and winning their confidence will be of vital importance.

As of now, both the BJP and Congress leaders in the region claim that the situation is favourable to their respective parties provided the election date is advanced.

2,Pressure mounts on riot refugees to return home,"AHMEDABAD: The government says the number of riot victims in relief camps is 14,378. The Qaumi Relief Committee of Gujarat - nodal agency for all relief committees in the city - alleges the figure is 33,000. The number game, on how many riot-affected still remain in relief camps, continues in the city.

From a high of 60 relief camps in and around Ahmedabad, the number has dropped to 12. The figure will further go down if the state government has its way.

The Ahmedabad district administration last weekend directed eight riot relief camps to close and send back inmates to their homes.

""This seems to be a direct fallout of the call for elections in Gujarat. While riot-affected are concerned about violence occurring during July 12 rath yatra and the grossly inadequate relief and rehabilitation, the state government is looking to project a conducive atmosphere for elections where there isn''t one,"" said Mohsin Kadri, chief organiser of Shah-e-Alam Roza relief camp.

Kadri says late on Sunday night a team of officials from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation arrived at the camp and said that of the 4,500 inmates, 1,500 riot victims would be relocated to a municipal school premises, in Danilimda gam.

""The move was sudden and without consulting the camp organisers. The Naroda-Patia victims don''t want to go anywhere"", says Kadri. Officials had to turn back but camp inmates fear that this may just be the beginning of the move to shut down the camp.

District collector K Srinivas said: ""We are not putting any pressure on the camps to close down, it is all voluntary. We have conferred with the camp inmates and a majority want to go home. Only a few who stayed in Naroda-Patia and Gulbarg Society are not decided yet.""

Srinivas added, ""What happened in Shah-e-Alam Roza camp was part of a temporary evacuation drill (in case of sudden rainfall) conducted at all relief camps. We will also set up water-proof tin shelters for those who will not be going back home in the near future.""

But, apprehensions are far from over. ""I will not leave this camp till the rath yatra is over. How can we go back without compensation ?,"" asked Ibrahimbhai Siddiqbhai Sheikh who used to stay in Dhupsinh ki Chali near the ill-fated Gulbarg Society. Sheikh has lost two sons and two daughters in the riots and now is sheltered at the relief camp near Dariakhan Ghummat which houses 2,911 inmates.

Khalid Sheikh, co-ordinator of relief camp number 15 in Bawair Hall of Dariapur area says: ""I had to send back 174 of the 600 inmates to their burnt and looted houses in Idgah Chowki, Jugaldas Chowki and Dariapur. They haven''t got any rehabilitation aid. Government pressure is telling on us.""

Relief camps at Juhapura house 3,114 riot-hit persons. ""Many have no houses to go back to,"" says Abdul Karim Shelat, organiser of the relief camp in Sankalit Nagar at Juhapura.

Mujib Ansari, co-ordinator of the Aman Chowk camp in Gomtipur says, ""We have begun preparing for the monsoons on our own. Tying plastic sheets on top of the camp structure is the best we can do. Threat of a violent rath yatra looms large and one cannot throw these 1,000-odd inmates out of the camp just like that.""

3,Govt for debate on poll conduct rule changes,"NEW DELHI: A debate will be held on the amendment to the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, before it is adopted under a Supreme Court directive, said Union law minister Arun Jaitley here on Tuesday.

The amendment makes candidates contesting elections answerable for criminal record, economic assets and educational qualifications.

The Supreme Court directive on amending the rules came on May 2, 2002, after the Election Commission (EC) approached it.

The EC wanted all candidates to file an affidavit giving information on past criminal cases, record of the pending cases, assets and family members, liabilities with banks and financial institutions and educational qualifications.

The cabinet then decided to amend Forms 2A to 2E as per the Supreme Court order. To ensure early framing of these rules, their effective enforcement and a possible legislation, the issue would be discussed with political parties, said Jaitley after a cabinet meeting.

But â€” he said in reply to a question â€” this was not a case of the government tossing the ball to political parties rather than implement an apex court directive. â€˜â€˜It is a political issue and consultations with political parties are required,â€™â€™ he said, to determine the consequences of non-compliance of the directive or providing inaccurate information.

It had to be determined whether such offences would attract disqualification or prosecution.

4,Naidu silent on election of Vice-President,"EW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP supremo N.Chandrababu Naidu, who had earlier queered the pitch for the BJPâ€™s presidential candidate, is learnt to have indicated that he may not raise any objection to the main NDA partner choosing its candidate for the Vice-Presidentâ€™s post.

Naidu, who flew into Delhi especially to be present when the NDAâ€™s presidential candidate A.P.J.Abdul Kalam filed his nomination papers on Tuesday, was reluctant to talk about the upcoming Vice-Presidentâ€™s election.

â€˜â€˜I will talk about it at the appropriate time,â€™â€™ he maintained, when asked about his choice for the Vice-Presidentâ€™s post. Naidu maintained that he had not even discussed this issue with the BJP leaders so far.

TDP sources said having shot down the BJPâ€™s original candidate P C Alexander, Naidu is understanding about BJP wanting its own nominee as vice-president.

7,Hunt on to nab Prince’s killers,"PATNA: Raids are being conducted by the police in connection with the murder of Prince in A G Colony here under the Shastri Nagar police station in course of municipal corporation polling in ward no. 4, but no arrests have been made. Prince is the son of former MLA of Shahpur, Dharmapal Singh.

The murder belied the tall claims of state election commissioner M L Majumdar that polling on Sunday in 35 wards of six districts, including eight of Patna Municipal Corporation and three of Gaya Municipal Corporation, passed off peacefully barring some bomb explosions by armed miscreants in ward no. 45 of Patna. According to him, the bombs were exploded by frustrated miscreants as they had failed to capture booths or resort to bogus voting.

According to the Shastri Nagar police station, the situation in the A G Colony and its adjoining areas is normal. Shops and markets were open.

The main accused, Mahesh Yadav, who is the husband of Usha Devi, one of the candidates of ward no. 4, is evading arrest, the police said.

Prince was the polling agent of Pana Devi, another candidate of the same ward. The murder was committed after polling was over at around 5.15 pm.

According to the police, prior to the murder Prince had a scuffle with Yadav, who was working as the polling agent of his wife.

10,Reduction in taxes ruled out,"GUNTUR: The percentage of direct taxes has been considerably increased in the recent past as indirect taxes are causing fluctuations in the markets, leading to economic instability in the country, said Rayasam Venkataramaiah, the chief commissioner of income tax.

He, however, ruled out any possibility to reduce the present taxes, saying that the existing tax rates are the lowest in the world.

Addressing a gathering here on Monday after inaugurating the new office premises of the Guntur Commissionerate, Venkataramaiah said that the share of direct taxes had touched almost 35 per cent of the total tax revenue, with a collection of Rs 68,000 crore.

He said that the ratio of direct and indirect taxes was 15:85 in 1985, after which the government made amendments in its fiscal policy, as the concept proved wrong.

He said that no other developed country had such low levels of direct taxes.

He said indirect taxes like customs duty, excise duty, and commercial taxes would have their impact on all citizens, irrespective of their income sources, whereas direct taxes would be imposed only on the people who can afford it.

Elaborating on the present taxation system, the chief commissioner said that in the seventies, the government used to collect almost 97 per cent from the total income in the form of income tax, but over a period, it was brought down to a maximum of 30 per cent.

14,Opposition walkout over education policy,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPI (M)-led LDF members on Tuesday walked out of the Kerala assembly protesting the rejection of an adjournment motion on Government move to frame uniform policy in the case of admission and fees for self-financing professional colleges of minority and majority communities.

Replying to the opposition sponsored motion, Education Minister Nalakath Sooppy said Government had not taken a final decision on the matter. The United Democratic Front''s high power committee had only made suggestions in this regard.

A decision would be taken after examining the legal aspects, he said, adding the Government''s intention was to extend certain rights enjoyed by minority institution managements to majority institutions also.

The Government policy would in no way breach the rights already guaranteed to minority institutions under the constitution. In the present circumstances, there was no need to adjourn the house and discuss the matter, he said.

Before walking out, Leader of the opposition V S Achuthanandan alleged that the new policy would lead to commercialisation of professional education sector.It was also violative of Supreme Court guidelines in the matter of admission in the Unnikrishnan case.

By extending the same privileges to the majority institutions, the Government was actually ""curtailing"" the rights of minority, he claimed.

Moving the motion, CPI-M deputy leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan warned the Government of ''serious consequences'' it went ahead with the education policy.

17,Club building violated by-laws: BJP,"BANGALORE: The Cosmopolitan Club at Jayanagar, which is extending its building by constructing an administrative block, has violated the by-laws apart from encroaching upon the adjacent pavement, the BJP city unit has charged.

BJP city unit President S Prakash, General Secretary B N Vijaykumar and Jayanagar Corporator Somashekar, who took reporters to the spot on Tuesday, said the club land, which belongs to the BCC, was given on a five-year lease in 1983.

After the expiry of the lease in 1988, it was not renewed and approval not given for further construction. While the BCC authorities were pressing the club management to buy the land instead of getting the lease renewed, the proposal was not accepted.

However, the BCC had given permission to lay three tennis courts. Instead, the club is going ahead with the construction of administrative block, Prakash alleged.

The club, which had initially provided for parking inside its premises, later used up the space for beautification. Now, the vehicles are all lined up on the roadside choking the traffic, the BJP members said.

Incidentally, club president YK Muddu Krishna, is also the BCC''s deputy commissioner, Development. ""Being well aware of the ongoing construction, Muddu Krishna, who is a senior official, should have stopped the violation and encroachment of the pavement,"" said Vijaykumar.

The members demanded that disciplinary action be initiated against Muddu Krishna and urged the government to look into the issue.

Besides, nearly 28 members of the club have objected to the construction of administrative block.

In a letter to the club president, members have said, ""The construction would infringe on the conditions of the lease. Also, the special general body has approved only the swimming pool. This is a major deviation from the original proposal, which requires fresh approval of special general body.""

18,No pact yet with govt: BKU,"CHANDIGARH: Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) supremo Ghasi Ram Nain, on Tuesday, clarified that his organisation had so far not entered into any written agreement with the Haryana government on its demands.

It was only on the basis of the assurances given by government representatives, at talks held at Jind on Monday, that he had announced withdrawal of monthlong â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ stir in public interest.

â€˜â€˜We have taken the decision in good faith and now it is for the government to fulfil its promises in letter and spirit. Otherwise they will have to face the music once again as we have not withdrawn the agitation totally,â€™â€™ said Nain over phone from Kandela, adding that the whole situation and the outcome of the talks with the government representatives would be reviewed at the â€˜mahapanchayatâ€™ to be held at Kandela on Wednesday.

Asked if a formal agreement would be signed after the chief minister returned from abroad, Nain said it all depended on whether or not the government invited them for further talks on their demands for low power rates for the farm sector and the writing off of power arrears.

â€˜â€˜These are our major demands. As far as the demand for compensation to those killed or injured in police firing during the agitation is concerned, it arose only as a result of police high-handedness against agitating farmers,â€™â€™ said Nain. He said the BKU had agreed to hold talks only after the latter issued orders for withdrawal of all cases filed against farmers since 1992.

Meanwhile, finance minister Sampat Singh, who held talks with the BKU on behalf of the government, on Tuesday, claimed that almost all blockades had been removed. Lashing out at the Congress for allegedly exploiting the situation arising out of the farmersâ€™ agitation in the state, he said the peace march launched by the Congress from Jind to Delhi in support of the farmers was a political gimmick.

He alleged that the government saw the Congressâ€™ hand in damage caused to power towers in Jind and Hisar districts recently. An inquiry was on and the culprits would be booked soon, said Singh.

The Congress, however, claims that it was only after the pressure generated by it that the government agreed to hold talks. It is proved by the fact that the chief minister at the initial stages ruled out talks with the BKU saying that it was in the hands of anti-social elements but later he left no stone unturned in going ahead with talks with the very people, alleges Congress.

19,Stay ordered on Punjab govt panels,"CHANDIGARH: In a significant decision, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, on Tuesday, stayed till further orders an important part of the instructions issued by the Punjab government.

According to the instructions, two committees of administrative secretaries had been created for different categories of officers and public servants, which would scrutinise complaints and other material, before approval was given for a vigilance department probe.

These panels would now cease to scrutinise documents and grant clearance. The high court stay has been ordered on paragraph four of the instructions issued by the Punjab government on March 6, 2000, with special emphasis on part(e) of the same.

The order was passed by the ordered on vacation bench of Justices Swatanter Kumar and Jasbir Singh, after conclusion of arguments on a writ petition filed by Ashok Chaudhry of the Lawyers Initiative, an HC-based organisation of advocates, which had sought court intervention for quashing the instructions which were against the law fixed by the apex court and the spirit of the criminal procedure code.

In their order, Justices Swatanter Kumar and Jasbir Singh said, that they were concerned with larger public interest at this stage. They further observed that it was common knowledge that the state government was probing dishonesty in public life.

This effort, they contended, would prove unfruitful in view of the instructions since it would be difficult for these investigating agencies to book the accused. The agencies would need a free hand in investigations and booking the accused, the judges observed while staying the instructions related to the administrative secretariesâ€™ panels.

The investigating agency has been directed to quickly complete the tasks at hand and submit a report in court on the next date of hearing which is July 29. Other parts of the instructions, the judges said, would not be stayed as of now since they were yet to be put under consideration.

Asking investigating officers of all ranks to strictly follow the orders, Justices Swatanter Kumar and Jasbir Singh, added that serious view would be taken of non-compliance.

The bench laid special emphasis on part(e) of the instructions which states: An inquiry or an FIR shall be registered on the recommendation of the respective committee, after approval of competent authority on the basis of complaints received.

20,"FDI dip, new language policy not related: CM","BANGALORE: Chief Minister SM Krishna on Tuesday said the state''s language policy of giving primacy to Kannada had nothing to do with the slump in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).

Speaking to reporters here after the Janata Darshan, Krishna said the slow down in FDI, if any, is due to various global factors and nothing to do with Kannada as medium of instruction or making it the administrative language. There can be no two opinions on giving primary importance to Kannada language in Karnataka. ""To say that the two are related is totally off the mark,"" he added.

To a query whether the high command had given him the green signal for cabinet reshuffle, Krishna shot back: ""Who told you that I had been to Delhi to discuss ministry reshuffle issue?""

Asked whom to believe - whether him (Krishna) or KPCC President Allum Veerabhadrappa - on reshuffle issue, Krishna said: ""I leave it to you to decide. But I have not made any comment on reshuffle.""

22,BJP to go to polls under Dhumal,"SHIMLA: The BJP has decided to go into the next assembly elections in the state, scheduled for March next year, under the leadership of chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal.

This was made clear by the partyâ€™s national secretary and Himachal incharge OP Kohli at the meeting of the BJP state council in Mandi on Monday.

Putting at rest all speculations of change of leadership in the state, he made it clear that the party would seek to come to power in the state again, under the leadership of Dhumal who would hold rallies in all the assembly segments and would be assisted by former chief minister Shanta Kumar.

He categorically denied that there was any rift between these two leaders and their supporters. However, sensing that the statement could best be taken with a pinch of salt, he hastened to add that if the party high command saw any signs of a divide, the differences would be resolved immediately.

Kohli also said that it was for the state unit of the party to decide whether it would continue to retain its ally in the state government, Sukh Ramâ€™s Himachal Vikas Congress (HVC), in the next assembly elections or go it alone.

It is yet to be seen how the Shanta faction reacts to the party high commandâ€™s decision to continue with Dhumal as the party leader in the state. Quite a few loyalists of Shanta Kumar, who were clear winners, were denied tickets in the last assembly elections and subsequent byelections and the heart-burning is still very visible.

Political observers here feel that the best chances of the party retaining power in the state would only be if the two senior state leaders bury the hatchet and work in unison.

Dhumal urges party men to highlight development works: Chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal has urged party leaders and workers to highlight the developmental works undertaken by the present state government during the last four years in a bid to counter the campaign launched by the Congress and other vested interests.

Addressing members of the state executive and state council at Mandi on Monday, he said that it was the duty of every office-bearer and party worker to educate the masses about the various developmental works undertaken by the present government, not only so that the government got due credit for them but the people also benefited from the programmes.

To press home his point, he said that though the government had reduced the hike in electricity and water tariffs, the Congress continued to spread false propaganda and malign the government on these very issues.

23,Badal ministers' assets to be probed: CM,"CHANDIGARH: Corruption as an issue reverberated in the Vidhan Sabha again on Tuesday with former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his nephew, Manpreet Singh, having a face-off with members of the treasury benches on the matter.

Even as Badal swore on the floor of the House that he had not accepted a single penny as bribe from anybody during the 50 years of his political career, chief minister Amarinder Singh did not look too impressed with the claim.

Winding up the debate on the governorâ€™s address, the chief minister announced inquiries would be held into the assets of all former SADBJP ministers, including the former chief minister. He denied that his government was indulging in a witch-hunt by targeting former SAD ministers.

Tempers ran high in the House when Badal was cornered by members of the treasury benches, particularly PWD minister Pratap Singh Bajwa, to swear if he had accepted any bribe during his tenure as chief minister. When Badal did so, Bajwa asked if he would swear by his family members as well.

Apparently peeved over it, Badal retorted it was unbecoming of the Congress government to level unsubstantiated charges. He offered to face a judicial inquiry into the allegations of amassing assets worth Rs 35,000 crore, levelled by Congress during its election campaign. Badal said, if found guilty, he was prepared to undergo any punishment.

He said he had no faith in the Vigilance Bureau and objected to the manner in which former ministers and their family members were being harassed by the junior vigilance staff.

Amarinder, however, reiterated his governmentâ€™s resolve to expose corruption. He justified the involvement of the Vigilance Bureau in the drive saying formation of inquiry commissions would delay justice.

The chief minister mocked Badal for leading a team of SAD leaders to prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and home minister LK Advani to express concern over â€˜â€˜deterioration in law and order in the state.â€™â€™ He said SAD leaders were looking for an alibi to escape the anti-corruption drive.

The chief minister sought to put Badal in the dock saying the latter had close ties with militants in the past. He presented pictures of Badal attending â€˜bhogâ€™ functions of militants like Avtar Singh Khaprilawal and Malkiat Singh Ajnala.
