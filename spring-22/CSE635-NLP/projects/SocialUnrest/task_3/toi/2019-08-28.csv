1,Kashmiri Pandits to boycott polls,"JAMMU: Panun Kashmir â€” an organisation championing the cause of Kashmiri Pandits, on Tuesday became the second organisation to give a poll boycott call. Earlier, separatist group Dukhtaran-e-Millat of Ashiya Andrabi had given a poll boycott call.

Addressing a press conference here, Panun chief Ajay Chrangoo said the organisation has been forced to boycott the assembly elections because the issues raised by it have not been addressed.

Taking umbrage at the suggestion that Panun was siding with Dukhtaran on the issue of poll boycott, Chrangoo said the reasons for Panuns boycott were entirely different. The nationalistic credentials of Panun were well-established in contrast to the Dukhtaran which doesnâ€™t recognise the Constitution. Criticising senior Kashmiri Pandit leader Amarnath Vaishnavi, Chrangoo said Vaishnavi had participated in the 1996 Lok Sabha polls but boycotted the state assembly elections held later. How can a person (Vaishnavi) who has been changing his stance on vital issues claim to represent the community? he asked.

Explaining the Panuns stance on poll boycott, Chrangoo accused the Election Commission of adopting double standards.

2,CBI seeks new law on economic offences,"NEW DELHI: The CBI and state anti-corruption bureaus have sought a new law and procedure code to tackle the rapidly-mounting economic offences in the country to ensure speedy trial.

""Economic offences, which are different from other crimes, are on the rise... there is no exact definition of â€˜economic offencesâ€™ available,"" said CBI director P C Sharma on Tuesday.

""It was felt that there is a need for a separate procedural law to govern the investigation and trial of economic offences because the existing provisions in Criminal Procedure Code and Evidence Act are not adequate to deal with such offences,"" said Sharma.

6,Virbhadra Singh plays down arrest rumours,"SHIMLA: On Monday afternoon, CLP leader Virbhadra Singh, against whom an FIR has been registered at the Sadar police station, had told journalists he anticipated a â€œmidnight knockâ€� by policemen to arrest him.

But the only â€œknockâ€� at Holly Lodge (his residence) came from reporters and Congress leaders who reached there as a rumour spread about the former chief minister''s likely arrest.

By midnight, a crowd of reporters, television cameramen, Congress MLAs, party workers and sympathisers of Virbhadra was waiting for men in khaki.

Rumours of an impending arrest had started spreading on the Mall from about 9 pm and some cameramen had taken up vantage positions outside Holly Lodge to capture the event.

Around 8.30 pm, there were signs that Himachal Police may swoop on Virbhadra but calls to police sources drew a blank and it was suspected that the operation was being kept under wraps.

The arrivals at Holly Lodge increased even as the police denied any knowledge of the reported move.

The presence of Congress MLAs Asha Kumari, Singhi Ram, Chander Kumar, Ram Lal Thakur, Kaul Singh, Dharam Pal, Prem Singh and Kashmir Singh, besides other Congress leaders and workers lent credence to the rumour.

Around 12.30 am, even as reporters and television cameramen continued their vigil, Virbhadra came out along with Congress MLAs and expressed surprise at the large number of mediapersons present there at that hour.

The legislators said they were there just to discuss the party strategy for the assembly session beginning Tuesday.

Strangely, the security personnel present at Virbhadra''s house seemed to think otherwise and were speculating if the police would arrive to arrest the CLP leader.

Virbhadra reiterated that the Kainthla report was baseless and the FIR against him was politically motivated.

On whether the Himachal Police could arrest him in the late hours, he said, â€˜â€˜It should not happen in a democratic set-up, but after the pre-dawn arrest of Karunanidhi, he would not be surprised if policemen turned up to arrest him.â€�

The police had not turned up till 1 am.

7,Octroi rate increase forces chemical traders out of city,"MUMBAI: About 20 per cent of traders who deal in liquid bulk like chemicals or edible oils have shifted out of the city because of the hike in octroi rates, according to the president of the All India Liquid Bulk Importers and Exporters Association (Ailbea) Jayant Lapsia.

He told TNN that some of these traders who import or export liquid bulk are willing to return to the city if the octroi rate is reduced. He pointed out that currently Rs 400 per tonne is imposed on chemicals as octroi, he said.

Ailbea represents all those who import or export chemicals throughout the country. The members had a meeting with finance minister Jayant Patil recently to point out that nationwide trade had been affected because of the hike in octroi rates.

â€œThe minister called the concerned municipal official and told him to reply to the queries raised by the trade over the octroi rate. We have also been told the BMC does not care if the trade shifts out of the city so long as they keep getting octroi,â€™â€™ Mr Lapsia said.

He explained that a trader may import over 10,000 tonnes of liquid bulk cargo and it was not possible to move such a huge quantity within 168 hours (seven days) from the city to claim exemption from paying octroi. â€œThe formalities which we must observe are too complicated and the quantity is such that we are unable to get tankers to carry this cargo out of the city,â€™â€™ he added.

When contacted, the vice president of a 63-year-old export house, VVF Ltd, Jose Mathew pointed out that although the state had encouraged exports by reducing levies, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) hiked the octroi to 5.5 per cent. â€œIf we are forced to pay these exorbitant charges, we will have to consider shifting our operations out of the city,â€™â€™ he added.

An MLA from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Basheer Patel justified the hike saying the BMC had a deficit of Rs 750 crore as mentioned in the Tinaikar committee report. But traders say that the steep hike is still not justified.

8,Minister rules out standardising octroi rates,"PUNE: While rejecting standardisation of octroi rates throughout Maharashtra, state finance minister Jayant Patil on Monday said the new system of account-based tax, introduced in Navi Mumbai and Amravati, could be a good substitute to octroi.

In his acceptance speech at felicitation ceremony organised by the Pune jewellersâ€™ association, Patil said it was not possible to rationalise octroi across the state for â€˜politicoeconomicalâ€™ reasons. â€œEvery municipal corporation had its own system of raising resources to fund development projects. Similarly, corporators in these bodies have different agendas,â€� Patil said, underlining the difficulty in rationalising octroi rates. However, he was quick to cite the examples of Navi Mumbai and Amravati corporations where tax was being charged on transactions recorded in accounts books rather than collecting octroi at entry points on city limits.

He said that such a system would not only save traders harassment, but also make the civic body think on ways of nabbing duty evaders. Patil assured the jewellers that he would speak to the police commissioner about the rising number of thefts in their shops. He was reacting to jewellersâ€™ grievance over the poor detection rate in jewellery shop thefts. Just two out of the 33 theft cases had been solved in the last two years, the jewellers complained. Patil, who was felicitated for bringing down the sales tax on gold and silver to just 0.5 per cent, said he had taken the move to increase the stateâ€™s revenue, through higher turnover.

9,"Students clash with police in Patna, several injured","PATNA: Several students and at least one police officer were injured in a pitched battle between the police and a group of students in front of the College of Commerce under the Patrakarnagar police station here on Tuesday. The police lobbed tear gas shells and resorted to lathicharge in order to disperse the mob of students.

The students had blocked the old bypass road and later disrupted the movement of several trains near Rajendranagar railway station for several hours and indulged in other acts of vandalism.

The students were agitated over the â€˜abruptâ€™ decision of the Magadh University authorities to postpone the examination of BA, part II, which was slated to begin on Tuesday. In protest against the police action, College of Commerce Chhatra Sangharsh Samiti (CCCSS) has called for Patna bandh on August 28.

Confirming the clash, DSP (sadar) Vijendra Singh said three students have been arrested by the police in this connection. They have been identified as Nishikant, Rajendra Kumar and Rishikesh. Singh added the officer in-charge of the Patrakarnagar police station, Vijay Kumar, received leg injury when a stone thrown by students hit him. He had to be taken to hospital for first aid.

The incident took place when a group of students blocked the road near the college, demanding the presence of state governor Vinod Chandra Pande on the spot to listen to their problems. The police arrived on the spot and tried to persuade the students to send a delegation to meet the authorities concerned for the redressal of their demands.

However, the students became violent and started pelting stones on the police party, forcing the latter to use tear gas and resort to lathicharge to disperse the students.

11,Social welfare minister’s man let off in food-for-work scam,"GUNTUR: Allegations are being levelled that a close aide of social welfare minister J R Pushparaj has been let off by the police after being caught red-handed while diverting Food-for-Work rice to a mill. To save the minister's skin, the Sattenapalli police implicated a fair shop dealer who had tipped off the police about the illegal transportation of rice.According to sources, P Laxminarayana of Visadala village in Tadikonda constituency, which is represented by Pushparaj, had secured some FFW contracts. On completion of the work, the contractor's men went to the dealer Tirumalasetti Sukanya's residence to obtain the rice due to them.However, the dealer refused to give rice to the agents and said she would distribute it only to the workers, and only at her residence.The contractor's men brought another dealer to the village who tried to persuade Sukanya. When Sukanya turned down the suggestion, Lakshminarayana's men went into the village and returned with some of their followers and presented them as labourers and insisted that they be given the rice immediately. Suspecting something fishy, the dealer urged them to come back the next day, as it would take at least 15 hours to complete the record work and distribute rice one by one. But the men wanted the distribution completed immediately.The helpless dealer, after collecting the rice coupons, distributed over nearly 110 quintals of rice. The rice was reportedly sold to a miller, Battuala Venkateswarlu of Kondamodu village near Piduguralla. However, after distributing the stock, the dealer with the help of some Congress activists, informed the police about the episode.The police initially acted swiftly and caught the lorry with the rice at Chalivendram centre and reportedly took into custody four people, including Lakshminarayana, his follower Seshagiri Rao, miller Battula Venkateswarlu and the driver of the lorry. However, they arrested only two of them.Sattenapalli circle inspector Jagjeevan Ram denied favouring anyone. Stating that the inquiry would be completed within a day or two, he tried to establish whether the rice was sold by the labourers themselves in the village. He clarified that Lakshminarayana was not in the lorry when it was stopped by the police. The seized rice is still with the police as the revenue authorities have reportedly refused to take back the stocks.

12,Jaya rules out granting amnesty to Veerappan,"NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa on Wednesday ruled out granting amnesty to forest brigand Veerappan and accused the previous DMK government of lacking political will to nab the sandalwood smuggler.

""There is no question of granting any amnesty to Veerappan. Once he is captured, he will have to face legal action and pay the penalty for all his crimes,"" she told a press conference here.

To a question as to who she thought was responsible for Veerappan still being at large, Jayalalithaa said, ""This was a result of a lack of political will of the DMK government in Tamil Nadu.""

Maintaining that through 28 encounters the Special Task Force (STF) had reduced Veerappan''s 150-strong gang to only five members between 1991 and 1996, she said a stage had come when he was running for food and shelter and was about to give up when Assembly elections in the state were to be held.

After her party lost in 1996, the Chief Minister said the Karunanidhi government called a halt to the STF operations.

""Not a single operation took place till actor Raj Kumar was abducted,"" she said, adding this had allowed Veerappan to regroup.

""My government has shown no lack of any political will after I took over and the STF has in the last one year arrested quite a few of Veerappan''s associates,"" she said.

She denied having received any tape from the forest brigand in connection with kidnapping of Janata Dal leader H Nagappa.

Replying to a question, Jayalalithaa said despite her differences with the Karnataka Chief Minister S M Krishna on the issue of sharing of Cauvery waters, her government would extend all help to Karnataka in catching Veerappan.

""The two issues are not linked and are entirely separate,"" she said, adding Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had assured her on Tuesday night that he would provide Centre''s assistance in nabbing Veerappan.

She said her government has sought from the Centre para-military forces trained in jungle operations, technical intelligence, surveillance and remote sensing equipment and helicopters for intensifying the search for the forest brigand.

15,"Steel industry not hurt by imports, rules US panel","WASHINGTON: The Bush administrationâ€™s protectionist steel policy has been bent out of shape â€“ much to the relief and delight of India â€“ following the rejection by a trade panel of additional tariffs Washington was proposing to safeguard its dying steel industry.

An independent US government agency called the International Trade Commission ruled 4 to 1 on Tuesday that American steel mills were not being injured by imports of cold-rolled steel from five countries, including India.

It also said there was no need to impose new tariffs that could have run as high as 150 percent for products from India.

India is the worldâ€™s tenth largest steel maker and some 30 per cent of its steel exports of 3 million tons heads to the United States in a peak year.

Although this constitutes only 3 per cent of the total US steel imports, the business was considered important enough for the $ 10 billion Indian steel industry to mount a big lobbying campaign in the US

It sent business delegations to present its case and hired specialty law companies, including the wellknown lobbying firm Steptoe and Johnson, to fight the barriers.

â€œThe important thing is we established that import of cold-rolled steel from India is not destructive but constructive to the United States,â€� Susan Esserman, former Deputy US Trade Representative now with Steptoe and Johnson who lobbied Indiaâ€™s case told Times News Network.

Esserman said she could not put a value to Indian imports, but had the final determination been affirmative, Indian imports would have had to pay duty of more than 150 per cent and it would have been a huge penalty for the Indian steel industry.

The US tariffs were primarily aimed at protecting its domestic steel industry, which has been in terminal decline for some years now.

An aging and high-cost workforce pitted against efficient upstarts elsewhere in the world has driven some 34 US steel companies, including some legendary firms such as United Steel, to bankruptcy.

The meltdown initially caused the Bush administration to erect trade barriers through high tariffs, contradicting its own advocacy of free trade. The administration was taunted by the European Union and Japan, among other affected parties.

More recently, the Bush administration hedged on the tariffs because while it was a politically sensitive issue that determined jobs and votes in the countryâ€™s rust belt states in an election year, it also meant US consumers had to pay more for homes and cars.

So while the ruling might hurt The ITC decision was welcomed by consumer activists, including lobbyists representing auto and construction industries.

""The ITC decision reflects the facts in this case,"" Jon Jenson, President of the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition said in a statement. ""Cold-rolled prices have increased 70 to 75 per cent, and steel consumers face serious and continuing supply shortages and delays.""

20,"GERC to mediate between GEB, farmers","AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) will soon set up a mechanism for interaction between the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) and its consumers to settle grievances. It will especially look at grievances of the agriculture sector consumers.

The suggestion to set up the mechanism came from the Consumer Education and Research Society (CERS), Ahmedabad. The commission noted that all other parties concerned had already accepted the CERS suggestion.

The commission has already ordered the setting up of a committee comprising representatives of the GEB, CERS, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) and CERC. The committee will have two representatives each, except GERC which will have one. Of the two GEB representatives, the board will nominate one member secretary and its chairman will nominate the other. CERS has nominated honorary director KK Bajaj and technical advisor LS Sharma to the committee.

The committee will suggest steps to install meters in the agricultural sector apart from, considering the problems of harassment and other grievances faced by farmers.

It will also consider issues regarding the quality of power supply to rural areas and suggest ways to improve generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Reducing of transmission and distribution losses in the state, and any other relevant matters will also be on its agenda.

The committee will invite local representatives of farmers to participate in its meetings, while discussing issues or grievances concerning a particular area.

The initial term of the committee will be one year. The GEB will provide secretarial assistance to the committee. The committee shall send a report to the commission of the deliberations made or decisions taken, every quarter.

Earlier, the commission had rejected the GEB''s application for extension of the time limit for providing meters to farmers from three to five years. CERS had been contesting the extension from the very beginning.

CERS had pleaded that any extension of the time given to the GEB for the purpose would be a recipe for a financial catastrophe. Ultimately, consumers would have to bear the loss incurred by the GEB, resulting in unreasonable taxation.
