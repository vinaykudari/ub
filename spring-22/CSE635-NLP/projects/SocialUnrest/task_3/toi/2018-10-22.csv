0,State govt. defends move on Ghai’s film institute,"mumbai: the state cultural affairs ministry has defended the decision to allow film-maker subash ghai to set up an institute for training in films, television and media arts at the state-owned land at goregaon film city, notwithstanding the criticism from the nationalist congress party (ncp). â€œit was essential that mumbai, which is the national capital of the entertainment industry, has an academy to train candidates in the handling of cameras, special effects, and others aspects of film-making. the idea is to equip them with the skills on par with hollywood experts and this institute of subhash ghai will train budding talents to meet international standards,â€� a senior mantralaya official told this newspaper. also, with the state economy facing near bankruptcy, it was unlikely that the democratic front government would sanction funds for the entertainment industry, he said, adding,â€œwe therefore decided to team up with subash ghai who will invest his money and expertise for the project. the role of the state will be merely to allow him to utilise the land in return for which the state will get an annual 15 per cent of the profits generated from this institute.â€� the decision to allow mr ghai to set up his pet project on a 20-acre plot at goregaon was taken by the maharashtra film, stage and cultural development corporation ltd.

7,Samata party asks Sonia to apologise,"new delhi: the samata party on monday demanded a public apology from congress president sonia gandhi for making wild accusations against its leader and defence minister george fernandes. ""while you have every right to oppose fernandes politically, but levelling baseless charges of corruption against him is not only highly immoral but coming from you is also totally hypocritical,"" samata party president v v krishna rao said in a letter to gandhi. he said it was no secret that gandhi did not want to see fernandes as defence minister. ""but that does not give you licence to make irresponsible allegations of corruption against him without a shred of evidence,"" he said. rao described as ""absolutely untenable"" gandhi's logic that fernandes should not have rejoined the cabinet before the venkataswami commission of inquiry into the tehelka expose completed its work. ""you seem to have forgotten that your late husband rajiv gandhi continued to be prime minister despite a jpc enquiring the bofors case. you also do not seem to remember that even at this point of time you are part of the rjd government in bihar despite laloo yadav and rabri devi chargesheeted in the court"", rao said.

8,`Govt not to take chances during puja on law and order',"patna: the bihar government on monday sounded alert in all 38 districts of the state in view of the dussehra festival. the home department has directed all district magistrates (dms) and superintendents of police (sps) to take precautionary measures to prevent any untoward incident under their respective jurisdiction during the festival. the dms and sps have been asked to take into account the national and state secrurity scenario, past record of an area and recent incidents of communal clashes while deciding on their line of action to tackle law and order. they have also been asked to identify sensitive areas and make police deployment accordingly. the government on monday filled up all 18 vacant posts of sub-divisional police officers (sdpos), including that of barh, raxaul, jagdishpur and maharajganj. home commissioner u n panjiyar said apart from the district police and homeguard jawans, central para-military forces and rapid action force (raf) units, too, would be deployed in sensitive areas. panjiyar said the centre had released two companies of the raf to the state, while 10 companies of the crpf were already deployed in extremist-affected districts, including patna. panjiyar did not rule out the possibility of the crpf companies being shifted to other sensitive places if required as the centre had not released any additional companies of the force. the state government had demanded four companies each of the raf and crpf to tackle law and order during the puja festival. one company of the raf is likely to be deployed in patna. the state police has identified patna, bhagalpur, nalanda, munger, sitamarhi, siwan, east champaran and darbhanga as sensitive districts. seven policemen were killed in a landmine blast caused by the people's war group (pwg) at village jagpura under dhanarua police station of patna district on october 19. the district, earlier, had witnessed mataurha and duttmai carnages under masaurhi and dhanarua police stations in august, and 13 persons were killed in the two incidents. a senior police official said that the government had deployed one company of the crpf and special task force (stf) jawans in dhanarua block following the jagpura incident. the police, however, are yet to make any arrest in connection with the landmine blast. panjiyar said the state government had sanctioned adequate fund for the purchase of landmine-resistant vehicles to prevent the death of policemen when on law and order duty. policemen have been asked to remain more alert while passing through kuchcha roads.

9,No students' union polls in universities for 17 yrs,"patna: the universities of bihar have been witnessing student unrest for quite sometime as most of their genuine grievances remain unredressed by the authorities concerned. as they do not have their elected or nominated representatives in various bodies of the universities, their demands go unattended. students' union elections in the universities have not been held for the last 17 years. both the bihar state universities act, 1976 (section 43) and the patna university act, 1976 (section 44) clearly provide for students' union elections, but the government as well as university authorities have been shying away from holding such elections for obvious reasons. the acts also provide for election of five students to the university senate by the members of the council of the students' union concerned. the senates are, however, functioning without any students' representatives in them. the concept of students' unions in colleges and universities was introduced several decades ago with a view to promoting democratic values among them and providing them with a common platform to ventilate their grievances. in patna university, the last students' union elections were held in 1984 with shambhu sharma being elected its president. since then no elections have been held. needless to say, students' welfare has become the greatest casualty in absence of any duly elected student body. not a single student of the university has received any scholarship for the last 10 years. bus services for students coming from different localities of the city were discontinued at least 15 years ago, causing immense hardship to poor ones. college canteens have become a thing of the remote past. sports and cultural activities have become sort of a luxury for university students, says rajesh ranjan, a student of science college. when a former president of the patna university students' union (pusu), laloo prasad yadav, became the chief minister of the state in 1990, students thought that elections to their unions would be held soon. an assurance to this effect was also given to a delegation of students by the ""hero of the 1974 student agitation"". but instead of holding direct elections to the unions, he initiated a move in november 1993 to nominate two students of his choice as top union functionaries. in fact, he forwarded the names of rajesh kumar and bipin bihari singh to the then vice-chancellor of patna university for being nominated as the president and general secretary respectively of the pusu. but this move failed due to the stiff opposition from the student community. as things stand today, statutes for conducting elections to university students' unions framed by the bihar inter-university board are awaiting the chancellor's approval. patna university may think of holding the students' union elections when the chancellor gives assent to the statutes concerned, says the dean of students' welfare of pu, n k singh. the issue was also raised at a recent meeting of the pu senate in which vice-chancellor (vc) k k jha supported the senators' demand for early students' union elections. in absence of a duly elected union, the vc has to deal with all sorts of student organisations, consuming much of his time and energy. at least a dozen student organisations affiliated to different political parties resort to agitations for fulfilment of just or even unjust demands of students, and more often than not they are recognised by the university authorities. these organisations agitate not only for academic issues but also for social, economic and political ones.
