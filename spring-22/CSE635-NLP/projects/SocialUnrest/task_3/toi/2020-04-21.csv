0,Group protests against number of public holidays,"MUMBAI: The Citizensâ€™ Organisation for Public Opinion (COPO) plans to file a public interest litigation (PIL) if the government does not reduce the number of public holidays by July 31, said Sanjeev Kanchan, the organisationâ€™s president.

â€œThe national exchequer loses Rs 1,000 crores per day during each public holiday,â€™â€™ he told a crowd that had gathered at Azad Maidan to protest against the number of public holidays for government employees. Government and semi-government offices work for only 183 days every year, he claimed.

â€œCurtail the number of public holidays,â€™â€™ the demonstrators chanted. Mr Kanchan remarked that India would get medals in an Olympic event for the highest number of holidays in a year.

Government offices did not work for 30 days between March and May, he said. â€œIt is imperative that the Central and state governments scrap holidays for the birthdays and death anniversaries of political and religious leaders,â€™â€™ he demanded.

1,Where are we heading with no trucks?,"BANGALORE: Furniture supplies: Not moving. Consumer goods: Not moving. Alcoholic beverages: Not moving. Car spare parts: Not moving. Two wheelers supplies: Not moving. Electrical goods: Not moving.

Export garments: Not moving. There is hardly a section of the industry that has not been hit by the truckersâ€™ strike. Surviving mainly on old stocks acquired before the truckers strike, industries have now reached a panic period. Old stocks are almost completely depleted and new stocks have not yet arrived. Worry is rising about customer satisfaction, finances and goods being damaged midway where trucks have been stopped. Mandovi Motors, senior General Manager-operations, B V Balakrishna admits that transportation is the backbone of the Indian automobile industry.

â€˜â€˜Manufacturers of spare parts, automobile services, dealers, production people, they are all being badly affected,â€™â€™ he said. Truck trailers are the main mode of transport for 90 per cent of cars reaching their destinations. The loss to the industry is the inability to supply a vehicle in time to a customer. Another problem comes with new demands. â€˜â€˜We get new requirements as per colour, size, accessory specification and we are unable to meet them now,â€™â€™ adds Balakrishna. As a result, 20 per cent of automobile customers have suffered. â€˜â€˜Our old stocks have been depleted. From Monday onwards, we have faced trouble with 6 orders pending.

Spare parts supply will be affected after a week,â€™â€™ a TVS Suzuki dealers, Galaxy Motors manager, Pradeep Singh said. The liquor industry is troubled too. United Breweries has experienced a 50 per cent drop in offtake and mainly affected is the dispatching of goods from distilleries. Within five days, there will be a shortage in primary stocks at the wholesale and retail fronts.

A serious disruption in production will follow and labour will be left to do only housekeeping jobs. â€˜â€˜About 3 million cases are dispatched per month. The peak of supply is usually in the last two weeks of April and the hit in despatches will affect production and consumption material supplies,â€™â€™ UB groupâ€™s, president-spirits division, Vijay Rekhi said. The result will be a loss of two million cases if the strike is not called off. For UB, badly hit areas include Maharashtra, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Punjab where truckersâ€™ associations are strong.

With roughly 7 million cases of alcoholic beverages sold per month, two third of the governmentâ€™s excise collections will be affected. The figures in the garment exports and electrical goods manufacturing industries are as depressing. With supplies coming from UP and Western India, Bajaj Electricals is suffering as their trucks have been stopped at check-posts.

About 45 per cent of the up-country supply market in Karnataka (Tumkur and Kolar) has been affected. â€˜â€˜For the last two days, tempos also have refused to take stocks,â€™â€™ Bajaj Electricals Limited, area manager-lighting division, Srinivasan A said. Finished goods and raw materials have been affected in the garment exports industry.

2,Height rules in these water parks!,"MANGALORE: As a general rule, children below three years of age are allowed free entry into amusement parks, theatres and even government buses. But water parks in India are an exception, where height is the criteria. The first amusement-cum-water-park, under the name Manasa, at Pilikula Nisarga Dhama, also follows the ''height rule''.

As per the rule, children below three feet are allowed free entry and those between 3 and 4.6 feet are charged more than half the entry fee applicable for adults. Siddharth, manager, says they are following the guidelines laid by the Water Parks Association of India and did not know the rationale behind it. Ashwath from GRS Fantasy Park, Mysore, has a plausible explanation. ""There is always a chance that parents would fib about the correct age of the children. Hence, the method"".

He said as they cannot force the people to carry birth certificates of their children, they had taken recourse to the height rule. Enquiries with water parks like Polo Amusement Park, Oysters, Wet & Wild, all near Delhi, Suraj Water Park and Essel World near Mumbai,Water Kingdom, Nishiland and Neeladri Amusement Park, confirmed it. These parks had stipulated a height of 3.3 feet for children to be allowed free entry.

Dr Santosh Soans, paediatrician, says children are 38-40 inches tall at the age of three. The business interests may be prime reason for keeping the height at three feet, he felt. Siddharth says they do not take the height rule that seriously and relax it a bit, looking at the situation.

As for the Manasa Park, though it opened with much fanfare in January, some facilities are still found wanting in the change rooms. The floor, which does not have anti-skid tiles, is slippery. The change rooms do not have hooks or shelves to help a person change clothes. Siddharth said none had complained about it.

However, he would look into it. On keeping open after 6 pm on week days, he said they could not keep water slides open after dark as per a Supreme Court order. However, pools can be kept open till 8 pm. Manasa has completed the first phase of work. The second phase will include lazy river slide, wave pools and go-karting, while the third phase will incorporate giant wheel, Tora Tora and other amusements.

3,"An incubator for hatching snake eggs, naturally","MANGALORE: Snakes have been Dr Ravindranath Aithal''s object of affection and study for the last 15 years. It is this interest in this slithering reptile that has made him develop a device to protect their eggs. Herpetologist Aithal''s device, an incubator, also helps snakes hatch eggs, naturally.

According to him, the incubator serves the purpose of maintaining constant temperature and humidity. It is a large wooden box with three sides covered with a thin wire mesh and the fourth side with glass pane. The bottom is covered with sand up to 2 inches, which form the basal substrate above which dry, clean hay is spread.

The clutch that remains as a clump (bound by a glue like secretion during egg laying) is placed centrally, flanked by shallow earthen bowls filled with water. The set-up is covered with more hay and placed in a dark corner till the eggs hatch. The mesh provides the much-needed air circulation that maintains the cozy environment till the eggs hatch. They can be constantly monitored through the glass pane.

Dr Aithal, who hails from Puttur, said the idea struck him when his friend, Balram Bhat of Udupi, came up with a clutch of 15 eggs. Both these friends found it necessary to save the eggs and help them hatch. These eggs were laid by a python. It was rare to find python eggs in urban areas and as they are rich in protein sources, any predator could feast on them. Dr Aithal says every year, he saves 100-200 such eggs and when hatched, he releases the young ones in their rightful habitat in the western ghats.

He has carried on this exercise for not less than 10 years. But championing such a cause has not been easy as the local people were apprehensive about their safety as his house, called ''Bana'' (thick grove that acts as a natural habitat to snakes), plays host to 23 species of snakes comprising both venomous and harmless varieties.

There were also wounded king cobras, albino cobras and boas. Dr Aithal says due to rapid deforestation and habitat destruction, snakes have been forced to leave their safe havens and venture into the close by areas and risk death on being discovered. He has successfully raised various local varieties of snakes from the blind thread worms to egg laying pythons, viviparous vipers and ovoviparous boas, among others.

5,Police open fire on protestors,"BHUJ: One person was injured when police fired at supporters of the ongoing transport strike, who had attacked a convoy of trucks which defied the strike call at Gandhidham, at around 7 pm on Monday. The protesters burnt a truck and injured about 12 persons in stone-throwing.

Police inspector R A Munshi of the Gandhidham police station said, ""We had to lathi-charge the protesters and lob tear-gas shells to prevent the situation from going out of control.""

About 400 trucks, associated with the Gandhidham Timber Association and the Gandhidham Salt Manufacturing Association, were carrying salt and timber from Kandla Port where they were stationed since the transport strike started. These truckers were defying the strike call as they had to pay heavy demurrage at the port.

Panic spread in Kandla and Gandhidham as the incident occurred at a public place. Kutch SP Subhash Trivedi rushed to Gandhidham after being informed about the incident. He told TNN that the situation was under control.

6,Car sales get stuck due to jammed trucks,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: If you were planning to buy your dream car this April, you may have to wait a while before getting behind the wheel. At least, till the truckers decide to get behind theirs.

The prolonged truckers strike has the automobile industry in dire straits as manufacturing units come to a grinding halt for want of raw materials and dealerships running out of stock. One of the most affected is Maruti Udyog with most of its dealerships exhausting models like Wagon-R, Esteem and M-800 Delux variants.

With not a single car carrier landing in the city in the past 10 days, Maruti dealers here are putting their heads together to work out an alternative - transport cars through rail rakes, an industry source said.

""We maintain a 15-day inventory, but without supply our stocks are down to 50 per cent. We are turning away customers for Wagon-R, Esteem and M-800 AC cars because we have no stock. In fact, I am holding 35-40 bookings for these models,"" Ravi Suri, general manager, Cargo Motors said.

The strike has played spoilsport for Fiat too, which launched its Palio diesel variant in March. ""Customers are threatening cancellations of Palio-diesel as deliveries were promised for April. We have 40 bookings but the strike hit even before a single new car could reach us. Stock of the petrol version too is down to 10 per cent,"" said Sanket Shah, sales manager, Tej Motors.

Sales of Mahindra''s much sought after Scorpio too have been hit. ""We have bookings for 10 Scorpios in Vadodara, but can''t because of the lack of stock,"" said a Mahindra dealer.

According to Sebastin Rathael, manager (sales), Amin Ford, Vadodara: ""We have orders for half a dozen cars but we are out of stock.""

V

adodara''s LMP Motors senior manager (marketing) S Rehman too is facing customers'' ire with twenty of them waiting for their Tata Indicas to arrive.

The situation is no different for two-wheeler dealers. ""We are down to 5 per cent of inventory. We maintain a 15-day stock but have hardly any left as the last stock arrived on April 7,"" Tejas Patel, director, Tej Auto said.

Vadodara-based Amin Automobiles is finding it difficult to cater to the demand for Bajaj motorcycles. ""The problem is acute as demand for Pulsar is high,"" said sales manager Shiva Patel.

For Ahmedabad-based Bajaj dealer Amin Automobiles, Niki Ford, Sharma Hyundai and LanDmark Honda, who stocked up in anticipation of the strike, inventory is fast depleting and high interest costs adding up.

""Though we had stocked up before the strike, it has jacked up our inventory cost as the interest burden is high,"" pointed out Garima Misra, CEO, Landmark Honda. ""It means a longer delay for customers and dealers are losing out on immediate sales as they may not have a particular colour or model that a customer wants,"" she added.

Agreed Hemant Karshalia, sales manager, Sharma Hyundai, whose stocks will last another 10 days: ""Though Santro and Accent availability is not a problem, some colours are not available.""

""We have a stock of 500 vehicles but if the strike continues another week we will face a shortage,"" admitted, KK Kapoor, general manager, Ahmedabad''s Amin Automobiles.

Cautioned Nikesh Gandhi of Niki Ford: ""With stocks down to 50 per cent, we need the strike to open within the next 3-4 days or things will start getting difficult especially if dealers start running low on spares.""

7,State govt holds talks with truckers,"AHMEDABAD: Even as the nation-wide indefinite strike by the transporters entered the second week, leaders of the Akhil Gujarat Truck Transport Association have assured the state government that truck operators will continue to help maintain the supply of essential goods in Gujarat.

Association president Nandlal Thapar told TNN that minister of state for home and transport Amit Shah and senior officials of the transport department had a meeting with the office-bearers of the association to persuade them to withdraw the strike in the larger interests of the trade and industry. The association leaders conveyed to the minister that that was not possible since the call for the strike was issued by their national body, and it was upto the All-India Transport Congress to decide on the issue.

Thapar said the action committee meeting of the state association would be held shortly to take stock of the situation in Gujarat. However, the association extended full support to the state government in the matter of supply of essential goods.

8,Stepbrother arrested for kid’s murder,"PUNE: The murder of 5-yearold Akshay Vitkar, who was reported missing on Thursday has come to light with the arrest of his 22-year-old stepbrother, Amit, and one Kedar Shinde, 19, both residents of Wadarwadi.

9,Prices of commodities shooting up in Pune,"PUNE: The indefinite nation-wide strike of transporters has started taking its toll on the grocery market in the city, with prices of coconuts, dry coconut and edible oil registering an increase. Market sources say prices may shoot up further if the strike is not withdrawn in the next two days.

Speaking to TNN on Monday, Mohan Oswal, president of the Poona Merchants Chamber, said prices of coconuts have gone up by Rs 25 per bag (containing 100 to 125 coconuts), the price of dry coconut registered an increase of Rs 10, while edible oil price has gone up by Rs 5 to Rs 10 per tin.

Oswal said the prices of these commodities have registered an increase in the retail market, but the hike would be less than Re 1 per kg. He, however, said that prices may go up further if the strike is not called off in the next two days. â€œThe stock of commodities too is running out,â€� he added.

The retail grocery shops had stocks which could last for a week as a result the effect of the strike was not felt immediately.

â€œBut now, the shopkeepers have started running out of items, and goods like edible oil and coconuts cannot be stored in huge quantity even in the wholesale market,â€� Oswal explained. He added that during the first week of the strike there were very few buyers, but now their number was likely to go up.

More said supply of foodgrains to the city has dropped by 40 to 50 per cent in the past few days. However, supply of milk, petrol and diesel has not been affected, he said. The administration did not have to arrange for private vehicles or ST buses transporters involved in ferrying milk, water, vegetables and medicines have been exempted from the strike, he added.

Meanwhile, Ghanshyam Jedhe, officer in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), told TNN that the Gultekdi market yard received supplies through 285 vehicles, which brought in vegetables and fruits.While 97 vehicles brought in onion, potatoes, garlic and ginger, 10 vehicles supplied leafy vegetables; 91 vehicles brought in vegetables and another 87 brought in fruits.

Jedhe said, barring onions and potatoes, almost all the commodities could be sent to nearby markets with the help of tempos and jeeps. The prices of vegetables were stable and were expected to remain so as the market continues to receive supplies through smaller vehicles.

10,RSP gives up hope for unity in rural polls,"KOLKATA: Left Front partner RSP has given up all hopes of achieving unity in distribution of seats in the panchayat elections to be held on May 11. With barely 24 hours remaining for withdrawal of nominations, unity continued to elude the Front in as many as 9,000 seats even on Monday.

Rivalry was most acute between the CPM and the RSP. In more than 75 per cent of the seats it was contesting, the party was locked in a direct fight with the CPM, senior RSP leader Kshiti Goswami admitted.

The two Front partners were contesting each other in 1,100 seats in Jalpaiguri, 1,000 seats in Murshidabad and 650 seats in South 24-Parganas. â€œI doubt whether we can achieve unity anymore.

Let us admit that there will be contests among the Left Front partners during this poll. All that we hope for is to avoid bloody clashes among ourselves,â€� the RSP leader said.

Goswamiâ€™s comments contradicted Left Front chairman Biman Boseâ€™s assertion that the number of disputed seats would not exceed 4,000.

The Forward Bloc, meanwhile, hoped that the bilateral talks being held between the CPM and the other Front partners would help in narrowing down the disputes over seats. â€œThe total picture would emerge on Tuesday, the last day of withdrawing nominations. But think the differences will be reduced,â€� Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said.

Both leaders, however, denied the Oppositionâ€™s charges that Trinamul, BJP and Congress candidates had been prevented from filing nominations.

11,Raidas Mandir traders protest,"LUCKNOW: Throwing traffic out of gear for hours and blocking a stretch of road, agitated residents and traders residing close to the Raidas Mandir flyover held a protest on Monday.

Residents said that it had been more than two years since the flyover was constructed after destroying the locality underneath. They expressed anger that no attention had been given till date to the condition of the road underneath the flyover which has been posing a nuisance to commuters and the residents.

Spokesperson, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee, Suresh Chandra Dwivedi told Times News Network on Monday that the road under the flyover had become a major irritant. During the dharna, the road from Kapoorthala crossing till the Raidas Mandir flyover was blocked and shop-keepers kept their establishments closed for the day in protest.

Women, children and elderly also took active part in the dharna. Amid sloganeering, the protesters criticised the local MLA for swindling funds allotted for the purpose. Later, a memorandum of demands meant for the prime minister was handed over to the district magistrate.

The foremost demand is to lay the road at the earliest. Another demand is to allocate permanent shops to vendors to sustain their business. There is also a demand to free residents from paying house tax. Installing a sewer line in the locality and regular supply of water and electricity are the other demands.

12,Karnataka govt's dam project illegal: Naidu,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday criticised the Karnataka government for â€œillegallyâ€™â€™ constructing the Paragodu project on the Chitravathi river. The project, he said, would harm the interests of Andhra Pradesh.

Addressing a Telugu Desam Party meeting, Naidu in a clear reference to the ongoing padayatra by CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, said the Congress leaders did not condemn the action of their partyâ€™s government in Karnataka. Naidu said AP would oppose the Karnataka government on all appropriate forums, as it had on the Almatti issue.

He accused the state Congress leaders of failing to influence their high command to instruct the Karnataka government to stop the construction of the dam. Naidu also criticised Congress president Sonia Gandhi for failing to apprise Prime Minister Vajpayee on the need for relief for Andhra Pradesh in view of the severe drought. In spite of being in power in more than 14 states, the Congress was promising free power only in Andhra Pradesh, he said.

13,FCR: One-stop solutions to problems of farmers,"LUCKNOW: To assess the efficacy of grain purchase at various centres, government opened a â€˜Food Control Roomâ€™ (FCR) on April 10 at Jawahar Bhawan which functions between 9 am and 9 pm. Anybody having any problem regarding grainâ€™s sell and purchase can lodge complaints by calling 0522-2286046.

The day to day proceedings here will be registered and sent to the ministry of food and civil supplies for proper redressal. Peak purchase season begins from April second week and continues till May third week.

Government has set the target of wheat purchase at 25 lakh metric tonne at the rate of Rs 620, plus Rs 10 as drought relief, per quintal this year. In the last procurement period, it had purchased 21.10 lakh metric tonnes of wheat.

This year, as the procurement season is just begining, there are just three complaint received at FCR. Meanwhile, farmers have to face a lot of harassment while selling wheat. Despite numerous checks and balances that look good on paper, middlemen continue to exploit the farmers, beguiling them with promises to pay more than the price support wheat collection centres of the government.

According to one official, farmers are told they would have to go through a labyrinthian process of to get even cheques encashed and that can be very intimidating for them. Another fear that preys upon their mind is that with different sized sieves being used - for removing unwanted particles - after sifting, the weight will be drastically reduced and consequently they will be paid lesser than what they can obtain from the middleman who also promise instant cash.

Though the government procurement centres are within a distance of 1 to 10 km, farmers generally take their crop only to face unnecessary harassment or to find that the centre is shut.

Another deterrent is the apathetic and callous attitude of officials who are unwilling to purchase their crop. â€œWhile setting stringent quality standards is a good practise, there are always loopholes within the system which can easily be exploited. So, the farmers are harassed on issues like tampered weight measurement and hole size of the sieve,â€� another added. In all such cases, complaints can be filed with the FCR.

According to FCR in-charge, PK Mitra, â€œInstead of giving bearer cheques we now give account payee cheques which is given on the basis of farmerâ€™s field records. Weight and measurements department check the weights and put their seal. Apart from this, if any official is caught or a complaint is filed, action will be taken.

14,"Tandon, Katiyar ‘happy’ about BJP ministers show","LUCKNOW: Sharp difference in the BJP came to the fore again on Monday when the two party senior leaders contradicted statements reportedly made by the party state in-charge Kalraj Mishra with regard to performance of the party quota ministers in the coalition government, headed by chief minister Mayawati.

In a joint statement, the party state president Vinay Katiyar and BJPLP Leader Lalji Tandon scotched rumours regarding removal of few party ministers from the ministry. â€œThe party is neither removing any BJP ministers nor making any changes in its quota in the government,â€� said the two leaders.

Without naming Kalraj Mishra, the two contradicted the â€˜media reportsâ€™, giving a clean chit to party ministers. â€œWe are satisfied with the functioning of the ministers of our party quota and no change is required,â€� said Tandon and Katiyar.

The joint statement was issued after the party state chief Vinay Katiyar and other leaders called on ailing Tandon at his Chowk residence. The two closeted for about half an hour and decided to issue a joint statement to scotch rumours about possible changes in BJP quota of ministers.

Before the crucial â€˜Delhi Panchayatâ€™ on April 1, the party state in-charge Kalraj Mishra had stated that performance of the BJP quota of ministers would be reviewed and assessed. A few days back Kalraj had dropped hints about possible changes, stating that performance of a few BJP ministers was not up to mark.

A few reports appearing in a section of press also suggested that some of BJP ministers may be dropped from the Mayawati ministry and new faces to be included. But both Tandon and Katiyar denied any changes.

â€œBy launching 1001 projects, the urban development minister Lalji Tandon has established a new record in speeding up development process in the state. Similarly, irrigation minister Om Prakash Singh made elaborate arrangements to ensure adequate irrigation facility during summer,â€� the joint statement said.

â€œThe performance of the BJP ministers is satisfactory and work done by them in districts allotted to them has been laudable. Their efforts in organising workersâ€™ conferences in assembly constituencies in short time is also lauded by the party leadership,â€� the statement further said.

Party leaders and office-bearers are, however, shocked and surprised over the joint statement. â€œThe facts and the situation prevailing in the party speak otherwise. The fact is that some of the ministers have done almost nothing for the party. As a result, party failed to give any message to its voters,â€� a party general secretary pointed out.

â€œWill the two senior leaders tell how many meetings our ministers held and attended in districts assigned to them? If they are regularly meeting the workers then why party office is flooded with complaints?â€� quipped another office-bearer.

15,Mulayam to take part in cycle rally,"LUCKNOW: With the Samajwadi Party workers in an upbeat mood following the granting of bail to their leaders, party president Mulayam Singh Yadav would be personally participating in the cycle rally in Lucknow on April 23.

Yadav along with party leaders and workers would leave the party headquarters at 11 am and cycle his way through the main thoroughfares of the city, highlighting the â€˜politics of vendetta unleashed by chief minister Mayawati against the SP membersâ€™. The failures of the present government and its anti- people policies would also form the theme of the mass-contact programme.

Yadav was initially scheduled to participate in the rally on April 19, but following the filing of FIRs against him and other party functionaries by the government, the move was postponed. However with the granting of bail to him, Amar Singh, Azam Khan and others by the High court, the SP president would personally participate in the rally on Wednesday.

The cyclists will pedal their way from the party office to Raj Bhawan, Hazratganj, Lalbagh, BN Road, Qaiserbagh, Nazirabad, Aminabad, La Touche Road, Basmandi crossing, Charbagh, Hussaingaj, Royal Hotel and Vidhan Sabha. The rally will end at the Hazratganj crossing.

16,Laloo oils lathi for rally,"PATNA: Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav on Monday applied oil on a lathi, asking thousands of his partyâ€™s workers to follow suit in the build-up for the April 30 Maha rally called here to fight communalism and protest the Iraq war.

Yadav said the lathi was chosen as the symbol for the rally because it is part of the identity of the rural people who use it against snakes and other harmful creatures. He said his appeal to the party workers to fight communal forces with lathis did not mean that he was provoking people to beat up BJP activists with it.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal workers oiled their lathis at district, block and village levels to mark the end of the first phase of the preparation for the Maha rally, he said. Yadav ridiculed the BJP and other parties for demanding a ban on the display of lathis at the RJD rally, saying the rally would be a peaceful one and the BJP workers need not be afraid.

Asserting that the rally at the Gandhi Maidan here would be historic, Yadav said the rally would herald the â€˜â€˜downfallâ€™â€™ of the BJP-led communal forces and would also express the partyâ€™s protest against the US-led military campaign in Iraq. Laloo warned party activists of stern action if they were found harassing businessmen to donate money for the rally.

Elaborating the usefulness of the lathi, Yadav even suggested mediamen to carry it. â€˜â€˜You people are frequently targeted by anti-socials during the course of performing your duties....A well oiled lathi will stand by you in times of trouble,â€™â€™ he joked. Yadav, in his inimitable style, also demonstrated how to carry a lathi on the shoulder so that nobody gets hurt.

Terming â€˜â€˜rallyâ€™â€™ to be a feminine word, Laloo & co. have invented the manly word â€˜â€˜raillaâ€™â€™ to describe the mega show. Around 100 party workers gathered for the show, which was for the camerapersons.

17,Priyanka's visit renews debate on her entry into politics,"NEW DELHI: The Congressâ€™ dynastic politics is back in focus with the fourth generation Nehru-Gandhi offspring making yet another foray into the political arena without getting formally anointed by the family or the party leadership. Non-political persons do not hold meetings with block presidents of a political party or urge the partyâ€™s youth wing to rebuild houses damaged in fire.

But that is what Priyanka did during her visit to Amethi last week. In fact, voters in Sonia Gandhiâ€™s constituency had asked Priyanka this time to be their representative in the next general elections. Without committing herself, she said she would decide later. But neither Sonia nor the party leadership has come out openly in support of her political actions. Priyanka has no official position in the party yet, leading to speculation that she may not be the chosen successor to Sonia. Congress leaders here see a parallel with the partyâ€™s attitude towards Sonia when she first tested waters in 1995. â€˜â€˜Between August 1995 and December 1997, when Sonia announced that she would campaign for the party, the leadership was ambiguous about its treatment of her.

The same ambiguity prevails now over Priyankaâ€™s status in the party,â€™â€™ said a Congress insider. Congress leaders point out that while UP leaders keep clamouring for Priyanka, the AICC leadership has never made any such demand. Congress politics revolves around the Gandhi family.

In fact, the career of many leaders depends on whether the son (Rahul Gandhi) or the daughter is anointed by the mother. While Priyanka has been making highly publicised visits to Amethi, her brother is yet to cut teeth in politics. But the fact that high profile leaders are not willing to pitch for Priyanka is seen as a clear indication that her political entry is yet to be sorted out within the family.

19,"No policy spat in Blackwill exit, says Washington","WASHINGTON: The US State Department on Monday rejected reports that US ambassador to India Robert Blackwill had quit because of differences with Washington, saying ""any speculation that there are policy reasons for this resignation is just totally misplaced.""

He put out a statement explaining his reasons. He explained his motivations to spend time with his family and return to teaching at Harvard. I do not have anything to add to that,"" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at his daily briefing when he was asked about ""your rather colorful Ambassador to India."" as one journalist put it.

Boucher said Blackwill had discussed the matter with Secretary of State Colin Powell some months ago and both the Secretary and the President were quite aware of his plans.

Powell spoke with the Ambassador this morning to convey his appreciation for the work he had done. They also spoke about the work on the current agenda between the US and India, since Blackwill will be there for some months more, he added.

Washingtonâ€™s thinktankers also contested the policy wrangle theory. â€œI''m sure he was impatient with the WH, State and everyone else, but if that were the problem I would have expected him to go quickly rather than give the world 4 months'' notice of his departure,â€� said Teresita Schaffer, a former US envoy to Sri Lanka now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Meanwhile, officials at Harvard Universityâ€™s Kennedy School of Government confirmed that they expected Blackwill to return to his teaching post late summer after his two year leave of absence. Although Blackwill, who is a lecturer, is not tenured, he stands to lose the job if he does not return.

But the rather abrupt announcement of the resignation more than three months after he proposed it hardly dampened speculation. An important member of Washingtonâ€™s strategic circle and a former Senior senate aide who did not want to be quoted suggested Blackwill was returning to Harvard to bide his time for a more important posting in a Bush second term, perhaps as an undersecretary or deputy secretary.

However, Washingtonâ€™s most prominent South Asia mavens declared that he was a successful US Ambassador to India, regardless of the reasons or circumstances of his departure.

â€œHe was supremely successful in making sure India remained high on the American agenda.â€� said Stephen P.Cohen, South Asia scholar now with the Brookings Institution. â€œUnder his stewardship US-Indian relations broke much new ground, and set the stage for a much closer relationship in the future.â€�

â€œI think he was remarkably successful in transforming the US.-India relationship into the kind of ties one expects the US. to have with a significant power,â€� agreed Schaffer, noting that the fallout from 9/11 made it difficult to remove the Pakistan factor from the US.-India relationship as fully as he might have liked, or as the Indian leadership would like.

Other US officials who worked closely with Blackwill and who declined to be named said there was some truth to the reports that he was a difficult man to work with, but as a strategic thinker and a diplomat, he had left his imprint on Indo-US relations.

24,Two arrested for farm murder,"VADODARA: The Sayajigunj police have arrested two persons in connection with the murder of a goods rickshaw puller on Sunday night. A dispute over distribution of money collected through sale of stolen goods is said to be the reason for his murder.

Police sources said the deceased, Pappu Melsingh, was member of a gang involved in stealing steel from closed factories. The gang members used to sell steel and distribute money among themselves.

Two members of the gang, Sony alias Asifali Sheikh and Kanu alias Prashant Gaekwad, suspected that Pappu was not honest and had been cheating them.

25,Regionalism could fuel riots: Deshmukh,"PUNE: Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Monday warned that the state would witness communal riots and severe law and order problem in the next two years if the state politics continues to be dominated by regionalism.

Deshmukh felt there was a grave danger to the unity of Maharashtra if politicians concentrated their energies on nurturing and fulfilling regional aspirations and ignored burning social problems like water scarcity, unemployment, increasing urbanisation and proliferation of criminal elements.

The former chief minister expressed these views while inaugurating the 129th session of the annual Vasant Vyakhyanmala â€” spring lecture series â€” organised by the Vaktrutvottejak Sabha.

Addressing a packed audience on future direction of politics, Deshmukh urged like-minded political leaders to forget petty differences and non-issues and join hands to oppose communal forces.

Without naming NCP leader Sharad Pawar, Deshmukh said non-issues like the foreign origin of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi should be swept under the carpet to protect the interests of the state and country. â€œIf the BJP can sideline the issue of construction of Ram temple to ensure that it remains in power, the issue of Soniaâ€™s origin can be left aside,â€� he remarked.

He said that it was imperative that individualistic problems and aspirations are forgotten and a united front is presented in the forthcoming Lok Sabha and assembly elections. â€œWe should not take separate stands on the issue for Lok Sabha and assembly electionsâ€�, he averred.

Deshmukh observed that political parties had, unfortunately, realised that it was no longer possible to win elections on the issues of development and social justice.

â€œIt all depends on how one whips up emotions in the few days before elections, a theory which has been proved by the BJPâ€™s sweeping success in Gujarat,â€� he pointed out. He stated that in the new coalition culture, the main aim was to remain in power by keeping the coalition partners happy.

â€œThis in turn feeds the monster of regionalism, from which law and Regionalism could fuel riots: Deshmukh Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh delivering the inaugural speech of the 129th session of the Vasant Vyakhyanmala in the city on Monday. Toi order problems crop up,â€� Deshmukh said, adding that in such a scenario peopleâ€™s problems and social issues were always put on the back burner.

Deshmukh said in the forthcoming elections, the BJP and other communal parties were likely to whip up communal passions and it was imperative that all secular-minded forces join hands to oppose their efforts.

Later speaking to reporters, Deshmukh reiterated that like-minded leaders will have to forget small issues. When asked if he had discussed the issue with Pawar, Deshmukh said that he had expressed views publicly very often. â€œNow it is up to the high command to take a decision,â€� said.

Answering a question regarding the future of the Krishna valley development project, Deshmukh said that the project should have been planned as per availability funds.

â€œInstead, the project was finalised first and then money raised through shortterm, high-interest loans rather than long-term, low-interest loans.When we came power there was nothing much we could do,â€� he remarked.
