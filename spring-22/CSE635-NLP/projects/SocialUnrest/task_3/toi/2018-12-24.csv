1,‘My election is EC approved’,"kolkata: in her war of attrition with rebel party mp ajit panja, trinamul congress chairperson mamata banerjee claimed on sunday that the election commission had already recognised her election as the party chief after she was 'unanimously elected' last month. in a parallel show of defiance on saturday, panja conducted the organisation poll of his group. he alleged that mamata had turned the party into her fiefdom and held a sham election in the name of a consensus. the veteran mp threatened to approach the commission to contest mamata's claim to the party poll symbol 'ghasphul. a fair organisational election has become a yardstick to garner the election commission's recognition as a political party as well as granting of the party's poll symbol in case of factional dispute. ""the commission addressed me as the chairperson of the party. it proved their approval of our election,'' said mamata rejecting panja's charge. she said that no action would be taken against the maverick cine actress and party member madhabi mukherjee for attending the show of panja camp on saturday. while both the leaders are contenders for berths in the union cabinet, mamata is desperate to wean over the state bjp and central leaders to make panja further isolated. on the other hand, panja is hell-bent to become a thorn in her flesh by questioning her command over the party and staking a parallel claim before the prime minister vajpai decides for another reshuffle.

2,Saffron alliance will contest Thane civic polls,"thane: the political parties have started gearing up for the thane municipal corporation (tmc) elections, slated for february as aspiring candidates have already filed their applications. meanwhile, local leaders are busy negotiating terms to ensure victory. the shiv sena and the bharatiya janata party leaders had the first round of deliberations on sunday and both described it as cordial. the alliance partners seem to have decided to bury the hatchet and forge a partnership which eluded them in the last polls. the ss-bjp have finalised seat arrangements in 68 wards on retention basis of their performance in the last polls. it will be however interesting to see how they share the remaining 48 seats. in the last elections the ruling sena-bjp had contested the elections independently. the former had won 39 seats whereas the latter managed to bag 11 seats. they came together out of compulsion to retain power. the bjp and the sena workers do not maintain a cordial relationship ever since the latter wrested the thane parliamentary seat from the bjp. the sena on the contrary has always maintained that thane district is their formidable bastion and the demand for more seats in local civic election by the bjp was a matter of `over confidence'. the bjp workers are in no mood to get dictated by sena whose behaviour they feel is nothing short of high handedness. expressing the general mood of the bjp camp, a senior office bearer said, ``the sena's tall claim of having a bastion is unfounded. they could not win an absolute majority in any civic body even when mr anand dighe was alive. they should now be more realistic when they seek our help in forming the alliance. according to sources in the party, the bjp will demand atleast 38 seats out of 116 wards. this works out to a seat each in every panel. ``our main aim will be to retain power in the tmc. we only hope that our partners will be more pragmatic as they too agree of keeping the congress out of power,'' said sena district chief raghunath more. the elections this time are going to be a different as the panel system is being introduced for the first time. the candidates will have to face almost a three times bigger ward. this will mean that the candidate has to be a known figure in three wards, he should be able to impress all the cross sections unlike his earlier stand of just appeasing the vote pockets and more important must be able to spend a bigger amount considering the extended area of the wards. in the new scenario the sitting corporators will hold sway as they are not only financially more competent but at the same time their performance is regularly highlighted in the media which gives them an edge over new faces. those candidates who restricted themselves to their own wards will be at a great loss if they are forced to file their nominations from the neighbouring ward. the congress as well as the nationalist congress party are in no mood of forming a united front. elaborating on the rigid stand taken by both the parties one of the senior office bearers said, ``unlike other parties we have maximum number of aspirants. seat arrangement will spell doom as those denied tickets will rebel against the official candidate. this way we may end up playing more in the hands of the saffron alliance.'' with the mood in both the congress factions against front, the sena-bjp may once again take a risk of trying their luck independently. however the sena campaign minus anand dighe will be the most important factor for the bjp to dictate terms. the sena high command too is very keen to retain power as it will demonstrate that the party is more important than an individual (read as mr dighe). the only setback for the bjp leadership while negotiating for more seats is the setback it received following five out of its 11 corporators betraying the party in various committee elections in the tmc. the tmc election is poised for an interesting battle with many factors, namely mr dighe's untimely death, corruption charges levied against its corporators by the nandlal committee, bickerings in congress as well as the ncp and ego problem faced by the sena-bjp. the tmc has a history of touch and go majority and perhaps independent candidates and disgruntled rebels will hold sway once again.

3,Major fire breaks out at Akbarallys,"mumbai: a major fire broke out at the bombay life building at veer nariman marg, fort, around 3.30 a.m. on friday. there were no casualties but the fire completely gutted the second floor office of lic housing finance. the four-storeyed building houses akbarallys departmental store on the ground floor, bajaj electricals on the first and national housing board on the third floor. though the fire did not spread to the other premises in the building, akbarallys closed shop since the entire store was filled with water splashed by the fire brigade. eight fire engines, four tankers and two snorkels took three hours to douse the fire. chief fire officer, amarjeet singh jandwal said the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained since investigations were still in the initial stages. the building, being an old structure, has very spacious halls and floor, a reason why the fire seems to have spread very quickly into all sections of the lic office,'' he said. m.m. desai, assistant divisional fire officer, is heading the investigations. lic officials were not available for comments but eyewitnesses said some kind of electrical work was going at the building during the night. s dasgupta, financial controller, akbarallys, said,``we could not open the shop for the public today. the fire brigade arrived at 4.30 a.m. and the fire was put out by 7.30 a.m. but the water used to douse the fire came down to the our floor and the entire store was full of water. we could barely walk through it. we engaged several suction pumps to flush the water out but there have been damages. we can open only tomorrow,'' he said.

4,BJP ups the ante on terror law,"pune: after failing to get the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) passed in the winter session of parliament, the bharatiya janata party (bjp) is set to launch a mass movement to create conducive atmosphere for the passage of the bill in the next session of the house. the bjp will launch its poto campaign with a massive anti-terrorism rally at shivaji park in mumbai on december 27, party vice-president gopinath munde told reporters here on sunday. the passage of poto has become imperative following the daring attacks on the parliament and the jammu and kashmir assembly, he said. munde said a formal proposal would be tabled at the rally urging the government to destroy terrorist-training camps in pak-occupied kashmir (pok). the party will also urge the government to take strongest possible action against the terrorists operating within the country, he added. union home minister l.k. advani and his cabinet colleague pramod mahajan will address the shivaji park rally, munde added. about his party's strategy for the coming civic polls, munde said the bjp would continue its alliance with the shiv sena in both the corporation and zilla parishad elections. he has asked local leaders to work out a seat sharing arrangement with the shiv sena. it may be recalled that the two constituents of the erstwhile ruling alliance in the state have always shared an uneasy relationship when it came to seat sharing. accordingly local bjp leaders were said to be averse to entering a seat-sharing arrangements in the city with the sena, fearing a raw deal. munde, however, claimed he had convinced his party workers about electoral alliance. when asked about the details of such an arrangement, however, munde replied diplomatically: both the parties would field candidates according to their strengths in various areas of the city. justifying the demand for poto, mr munde said the maharashtra control of organised crime act (mcoca), which has been in existence in the state, was exactly similar to the proposed ordinance. under existing laws, most of the accused get bail and thereby hamper investigations. but poto, like mcoca, gives investigating agencies more time to unravel the ploys of anti-social elements, he said. munde also refuted the possibility of the law being used for political vendetta.
