0,"Women, not govt, can right men: CM","BANGALORE: Ask your husbands to give up vices like liquor and online lottery, rather than depending on the government to do that. This was chief minister S.M. Krishnaâ€™s advice to women on International Womenâ€™s Day on Saturday.

â€œDonâ€™t ask the government to protect your husbands from vices. Win them with love and affection and persuade them to be more responsible. It is easy to say ban this and that. But one must realise that the government earns revenue of nearly Rs 2,000 crore from excise alone. Is it possible to ban? How do we pay salaries and give free education to girls, if this money goes,â€™â€™ he asked the 2,000-odd women who gathered for the celebrations.

Questioning the logic behind imposing a ban, he said: â€œThere is gambling in cricket too, close to Rs 50,000 crore. Can we ban the game? Just because men are gambling, you canâ€™t kill the horses. I appeal to you women to introduce discipline in your homes, rather than ask the government to take action. Itâ€™s not possible for us to prevent your men from falling into the evil circles.â€™â€™ Expressing regret over inequalities in society, Krishna said compulsory education and economic independence are vital for womensâ€™ empowerment.

Quoting a sloka, he said: â€œWe must treat the woman as a devathe (goddess), as per tradition. It is unfortunate that sometimes, women are not even treated as a human being.â€™â€™ Minister of state for science and technology Nafees Fazal inaugurated an information kiosk for rural women. They will have information on health, nutrition, government programmes, legal issues, womenâ€™s rights, market prices, sanitation and other issues. â€œThe kiosk will feature voice response, Net connectivity and smart card technology,â€™â€™ she said.

1,Amnesty attacks Gujarat govt vis-à-vis rehabilitation policy,"NEW DELHI: Charging the Gujarat government with having a â€œgrossly defective rehabilitationâ€� policy for woman riot victims, Amnesty International on Saturday demanded immediate steps to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of crime and also provide proper rehabilitation.

â€œMore than a year after the beginning of the massacres, which targeted the Muslim community, there is still no official acknowledgement on the part of the government of Gujarat and the criminal justice system in the state of the magnitude and scale with which women were made a specific target of that violence,â€� Amnesty International said on the occasion of International Womenâ€™s Day.

Expressing solidarity with woman riot victims, the global human rights body said that it calls â€œon authorities within the government, the criminal justice system, the health system and the administration of the state to publicly acknowledge the extent of gender violence which took place in the state, to take urgent steps to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators and to avoid appropriate redress and protection to the victimsâ€�.

â€œSpecific mechanism and procedures, made contingent upon the exceptional circumstances in which the violence took place, should be set up urgently in Gujarat to ensure that crime against women are investigated, the perpetrators prosecuted and that proper rehabilitation is offered to the victims,â€� it said.

â€œThe perpetrators of sexual abuse should be promptly prosecuted, even in the absence of a medical examination, provided that other compelling evidence of the crime exist,â€� Amnesty International said.

Victims of sexual abuse should be offered rehabilitation packages, which include financial assistance, shelter and medical or psychiatric care, it said.

â€œThe government rehabilitation policy, in itself grossly defective, is reported to have no focus at all on specific issues faced by women victims, including health and reproductive needs, access to counselling and to safe spaces to recover and rebuild themselves and economic hardship after the loss of male family members,â€� the rights body said. â€œNo specific scheme, rehabilitation package or special procedure have been offered to the woman riot victims,â€� it added.

2,Women's Day celebrations turn into protest rally,"VADODARA: It was almost like Marie Antoinette telling poor peasants that if they did not have bread, they should eat cake. City mayor Bharati Vyas replicated that on Saturday when she told victims of alcohol abuse, â€œyou should be able to control your husbandâ€�, when they were protesting against the inability of the state government to effectively implement the prohibition policy.

The Womenâ€™s Day celebrations at the Gandhinagar Gruh here, turned into an event of Womenâ€™s Day demonstrations after enraged women, all of who were victims of physical abuse inflicted by their alcoholic husbands, gathered at the venue turning it into a platform to air their grievances.

The protesting women were alleging that the state government had not done much to check the growing trade of illicit liquor despite a prohibition policy and the bootlegging nexus was an open secret in many city areas.

Mayor Bharati Vyas had arranged the celebrations, but it turned into demonstration when these victims of alcoholic and abusive spouses stormed the Gandhinagar Gruh auditorium to air their protests. Both, district collector Bhagyesh Jha and Vyas, had to face the ire of over 300 women, of which some went up to the stage to air their grudges.

Sonia Kaul counsellor at the S C Patel de-addiction centre said that they had arranged a protest rally against the state governmentâ€™s inability to implement the prohibition laws. â€œWe had planned a protest and a skit near Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s statue. More than 300 women, some victims of wife beating, physical and mental abuse, some divorced and some who were spouses of addicts and HIV positive, participated,â€� she said.

â€œWhen we met the mayor and the collector, the women recounted how their husbands beat them up and how some were even raped. But rather than understanding these problems, Vyas said â€˜You should know how to control your husbandsâ€™,â€� said Kaul â€œThe women found her statement insensitive, coming as it did on Womenâ€™s Day. Vyas also told them that this was no time to protest as they were celebrating the day. But the angry women said that there were bootleggers in various city areas and the state police could not control them,â€� she said.

According to Kaul, the mayor further angered the protesting women when she told them that they should write to the police letters, giving information about the bootlegging nexus in city areas. â€œThe women were agitated as here was a mayor who was not being sensitive to their problems, and then expected the victims to look out for bootleggers. What is the police doing, if they cannot crackdown on the illicit trade of liquor,â€� said Kaul.

However when contacted, Bharati Vyas said that it appeared to be a move by the opposition to tarnish her image. â€œThis is a political stunt, initiated by people with vested interests,â€� she said.

3,Weavers to observe bandh on Tuesday,"SURAT: In view of the variations in excise duty on yarns, as proposed in the Union Budget, which might complicate assessments of products having a combination of yarns as raw materials and lead to harassment of weavers, the powerloom industry here, would observe a bandh on Tuesday to protest against these budgetary provisions.

â€œExcise duty on yarns ranges between eight to 24 per cent, depending on the variety. It would be difficult to assess the duty component on finished products in which a combination of yarns are used as inputs,â€� said Yogesh Mehra, general secretary of Federation of Gujarat Weavers Association (FOGWA). â€œFor example, a polyester saree could have a border made of viscose fabric, hence, two varying sets of excise duties would be required to assess the total duty on it,â€� he added.

â€œThus, not only confusion but also a wide spread apprehension prevails among powerloom unit owners of being harassed by the excise officials, for non-compliance of the same,â€� said Mehra.

Besides this, the introduction of value-added-tax (VAT) would also be protested against as it would require weavers with small units to maintain records and on failure, be imposed with penalties to the extent of Rs 1,000 per day. â€œThis would put the whole powerloom industry into jeopardy, as over two-thirds of the unit owners are not educated enough to keep themselves abreast of the new provisions, nor are they resourceful enough to engage professionals for this work,â€� said Mehra.

According to FOGWA president Manu Patel, the powerloom industry is an unorganised sector and for many weavers, with just a handful of units under operation, the duty component would be a hard proposition to comply with. Already recession hit, the powerloom industry, by being put under the excise network, would have to face further economic constraints in the shape of excise duties, Patel added.

â€œBy introducing CENVAT even for the powerloom industry, majority of weavers have been pushed to the wall. It will be difficult for them to maintain registers of production on a daily basis when part of the same is returned by traders. Complications of invoicing would be difficult to bear,â€� said chairman of the economic cell of Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee, Rupin Patchigar. He added that for successful implementation of CENVAT and VAT, the whole process should be computerised, but hardly a few in the powerloom industry here, have that kind of technical advantage.Times News Network Surat: In view of the variations in excise duty on yarns, as proposed in the Union Budget, which might complicate assessments of products having a combination of yarns as raw materials and lead to harassment of weavers, the powerloom industry here, would observe a bandh on Tuesday to protest against these budgetary provisions.

4,5 of family commit suicide in Ahmedabad,"AHMEDABAD: Poverty and unemployment forced five members of a family residing in Nava Vadaj area here, to commit suicide on Saturday morning.

A zealous devotee of Lord Ram, Nagji Nathabhai Makwana (40) along with his 35-year-old wife Hansaben, two daughters Dhabu (8), Tini (15) and son Bhupendra (13) burnt themselves to death.

The incident took place at around 5 am and was reported to the Naranpura police by local residents who spotted smoke coming out of the familyâ€™s one-roomed slum quarter in Pur Pidit Nagar.

A neighbour of Nagji told TNN: â€œI heard a shriek and rushed out to see the smoke. By then some other residents had also gathered around. The door was locked, so we broke in and found that nothing much could be done. We called in an ambulance and the police.â€� Nagjiâ€™s father Nathabhai Makwana was a victim of the partition in 1947. He had to leave his home in Karachih and re-start from scratch after reaching Morbi.

Later the family shifted to Ahmedabad but their run of misfortune continued as eight years back Nathabhai, in a fit of insanity, committed suicide by jumping into the Sabarmati river. About four years ago, Nagji and his family had shifted to the Pur Pidit Nagar, which is a rehabilitation site for victims rendered homeless by the 1972 floods. Sources said that prior to this, Makwana used to stay with his mother and brothers at Juna Vadaj.

Due to financial constraints Nagji changed houses often and had been staying in this house near the Nava Vadaj police chowky for the last one year, paying a monthly rent of Rs 300. Local residents say that Makwana may have been mentally unbalanced as he spent most of his time praying to Ram and at times even â€œinteracting with himâ€�. His wife used to work as a daily wage earner, while his 13-year-old son worked as a cobbler. His two daughters, Dhabu and Tini, had recently got admission in the first grade of the Nava Vadaj Kanya Shala. When the police reached the spot along with experts from Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), the bodies lay frozen in different postures. Poverty was written large on the household as the premises did not have any piece of furniture or even an electric connection to show. Only a few empty utensils lay isolated beside a kerosene stove.

A five-litre container and another one-litre container were recovered by the police. These, the investigators said, were used to bring in kerosene which was later used by Makwana to douse his family members. PI of Navrangpura P N Kher is investigating the case. Police sources said that this was the fourth family suicide case in the city since the communal riots last year. Instances of family members committing suicide were also reported from areas like Sabarmati, Kagdapith, Naroda and Satellite.

In Maninagar, Sherkotda and recently at Vejalpur areas of the city, cases of two members of the same family ending their lives were also reported. City police officials however clarified that only few of these suicides were caused by poor economic conditions.

5,Need for new approach to combat increase in economic corruption,"SURAT: In view of the increasing number of economic offences that are taking place in connivance with government officials, at decision making levels, there is need for a broad-based approach to curb the menace of corruption.

The need is to follow a new approach, instead of following traditional methods like waiting for circumstantial evidences and laying a trap to nab offenders.

Senior police officials, along with officials from the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) from South Gujarat attended a meeting held on Thursday here, where this issue was discussed and they agreed on the need to spearhead anti-corruption measures.

While director general (ACB) S Banerjee, who chaired the meeting, focused on the urgent need to evolve a methodology that will put a check on corruption, other high-level police officials emphasised on the need to have better co-ordination among various agencies, including the anti-corruption bureau and the police.

Police commissioner V K Gupta, who attended the meeting, said the deliberations were mainly on the issue of how to spearhead anti-corruption measures.

He told TNN that traditional practices, like the anti-corruption officials laying a seize by deputing decoys, need to be evolved as nowadays the whole dimension of corrupt practices has grown manifold, with concepts like â€˜speed moneyâ€™ for expediting projects and â€˜protection moneyâ€™ for giving safe passage to bootleggers.

All these have resulted in substantial loss to the public exchequer, Gupta said. Additional commissioner of police Mohan Jha told TNN that the anti-corruption bureau should be strengthened for effective tackling of economic offences, which take place in connivance with public servants.

ACB assistant director Bharatsinh Sarvaiya told TNN that to evolve a proper methodology to combat economic offences, there is need for co-ordination between all agencies.

6,Seven-day remand for arrested mafia leader,"RAJKOT: Noora Vagher, one of the most wanted mafia leader who was arrested from the Sayeed Kalaria village on Friday was sent on a seven-day police remand on Saturday by a court in Upleta. Noora was wanted in connection with the murder of three custom officials in 1992 near Khambhaliya.

The police are also investigating the how Noora had managed to acquire the French-made pistol seized from him. The investigations would also concentrate on who had provided shelter to Noora all these years and where did he put up during his foreign jaunts, said Rajkot SP V M Parghi.

It is said that the police have now taken Noora to an undisclosed place in Khambhaliya . It is this town that Noora had used as his base and it is near here that he had murdered the three custom officials. The Jamnagar police are also waiting to interrogate Noora and conduct further investigations in to the murder of the officials and Nooraâ€™s smuggling activities.

The Dhoraji-Upleta area has been a hot bed of terrorist activities of late and anti national forces have found shelter at Dhoraji. The police is also trying to verify if Noora had any contact with such anti-national elements or not. The police refused to divulge any more information on the interrogation of the mafia leader.

7,Naik hints at increase in LPG prices,"KOLKATA: Union petroleum minister Ram Naik, at a press conference in the city on Saturday, hinted at a possible hike in LPG and kerosene prices to bridge the increasing gap between the oil import bill and the subsidy provided by the government.

Last yearâ€™s bill of Rs 78,000 crore is expected to be severely dented by the volatility of crude prices in the last few months.

Price of crude oil has shot up from $18-19 a barrel in February 2002 to $34-35 a barrel in February 2003 following apprehensions of an American strike on Iraq. A full-blown war could disrupt oil supplies from West Asia.

""The decision will be announced by Union finance minister Jaswant Singh in his reply to the debate on Budget in Parliament on March 11,"" Naik said. Asked if the government would withdraw subsidies on LPG completely, he said that would be done in phases over three to five years.

In the event of war, India had adequate stocks for two months, the petroleum minister said. ""Our storage tanks are full with reserves of 17 million tonne. We have also signed some

strategic forward agreements for uninterrupted supply of oil from other regions if war breaks out in West Asia,""â€� he informed.

Naik indicated that the government would import oil even if prices shot up to a record high. Given the comfortable forex reserves at $75 billion, the government has decided to continue imports to keep the economy running.

8,Rebel Samata ministers draw a blank; Marandi is happy,"RANCHI: The scene at the Birsa Munda Airport here on Saturday afternoon was paradoxical. While four of the five NDA ministers, who were in New Delhi since March 3 to negotiate with their central leaders for the ouster of Jharkhand CM Babulal Marandi, and topple the government in the process, returned dejected and somewhat shaken, Marandi appeared confident and nonchalant, describing the episode as a family squabble which could be sorted out through talks.

""The people of Jharkhand have given us a mandate for five years, and we will complete the term,"" a confident Marandi told TNN while boarding his chopper for Bokaro. Asked whether he was trying to woo JMM MLAs to balance the numbers game in case the dissident ministers decided to break away, Marandi smiled, saying ""I have asked not one or two, but all the 12 JMM MLAs to cross over and work together with the BJP in the interest of the state"".

Incidentally, the BJP Legislature Party held a meeting here on Friday evening and expressed its full faith in the leadership of Babulal Marandi.

On the other hand, while supporters of the dissident ministers, belonging to the Samata Party and the Janata Dal-U, had reached the airport with hired drummers as a show of strength, their leaders returned practically empty-handed. ""We have conveyed our demand to our leaders â€” Samata president and NDA convener George Fernandes, Nitish Kumar as well as JD-U president Sharad Yadav,"" urban development minister Madhu Singh said.

The five ministers â€” Bachcha Singh, Madhu Singh, Ramesh Singh Munda, Jaleswar Mahto and Lalchand Mahto â€” have revolted against the working style of Marandi, who, according to them, did not have control over his bureaucrats and police officials. The ministers have also been demanding that the transfer and postings of Class I officials be made through the cabinet. Significantly, Bachcha Singh returned here ahead of the other four ministers and is reported to have compromised with Marandi. Urban development secretary Vimal Kirti Singh was shifted to the industries department on Friday, which was one of the demands of Singh.

The ministers, however, asserted on Saturday that whatever be the response of the central leaders, they would stick to their stand for a change in leadership of the NDA government here and if the need arose, they would even look for options outside the NDA. ""Aagey Aagey dekhiye hota hai kya,"" Ramesh Singh Munda said. ""Donâ€™t ask us to open all our cards now,"" he added.

According to insiders in the Samata Party and JD-U, George Fernandes told the ministers that he would talk to the top BJP leadership and then revert to them. The ministers, on their part, asserted that the ball was now in the court of the top leadership of the BJP, Samata Party and JD-U.

9,Imam asks Muslims to form a party,"NEW DELHI: Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid on Sunday appealed to the Muslims to stop supporting the ""so-called"" secular parties, including the Congress and form a separate national party to protect the interests of the community.

In a speech laced with questions to many leaders of ""secular parties"" seated on the dias at rally organised by the Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind here, Imam Maulana Syed Ahmed Bukhari said ""Secularism is dead in this country after the Gujarat riots in which hundreds of Muslims were killed. Now it is high time we chart our own course"".

Pointing to Congress leader Arjun Singh, he said ""it was his party which triggered the Ayodhya controversy. They opened the locks, performed shilanyas and the masjid was brought down during their regime. 1984 anti-sikh riots were instigated by his partymen"".

""What secularism are you and your President (Sonia Gandhi) talking about?"" he asked a visibly embarrassed Singh.

Directing his ire this time at other leaders Ram Vilas Paswan, Arif Mohammed Khan and Udit Raj who were also present, he said ""Paswans and Mulayam Singhs rule after we vote and it is we who are the ultimate sufferers.""

Alleging that the Muslim community has been ""under constant attack ever since independence"", the Imam said ""we were under a false impression that the so called secular parties would be our saviours. We can no longer lean on them. This over-dependence had weakened the community"".

10,Pak Islamic parties hold huge anti-war rally,"ISLAMABAD: In a show of solidarity with people of Iraq, thousands of Pakistanis today held a huge rally in Rawalpindi protesting a possible US-led offensive against Baghdad.

Termed as the ""million march"", activists of different Islamist parties headed by Muthahida Majlis-e-Amal took part in the rally and demanded the government not vote for a second US resolution against Iraq.

Heavy security arrangements were made to prevent any untoward incidents, police said.

Besides the leaders of the MMA, cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan who heads a political party called, Pakistan Insaf-e-Tehrik also took part in the march.

""Pakistan should not abstain, but it must oppose any UN resolution if it is put for voting in the UN Security Council,"" Qazi Hussain Ahmad, head of the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami, a key component of MMA said.

""We should not miss the opportunity of slapping America on its face,"" he said.

Pakistan currently occupies a non-permanent seat of the UN Security Council.

12,"Oppn will target govt on power, drought issues","MUMBAI: Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, who will enter the Vidhan Bhavan on Monday after a gap of ten years, is likely to have a tough time with the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance gearing up to put the Democratic Front (DF) government on the mat for its failure on several fronts.

Besides, resentment is building up among Congress ministers. In fact, some of them have complained that Mr Shinde has no time to discuss issues relating to their departments.

Although Mr Shinde enjoys the full support of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, carrying his 69-member jumbo cabinet and DF MLAs along to counter the opposition onslaught will be a tall order.

Finance minister Jayant Patil of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will present his fourth Budget during the legislature session commencing on Monday.

The main task before him will be to handle the huge debt burden, which has soared to Rs 80,000 crore. The governmentâ€™s indifference has resulted in bureaucrats questioning its sincerity in tackling the issue as apart from holding a few meetings with heads of financial institutions, nothing concrete has been done to deal with the situation.

â€œThe government has proved that it is not serious about facing the situation.

How else will you explain the gifting away of a prime plot at Nariman Point to the S.B. Chavan trust and another plot near the World Trade Centre to MLAs and IAS officers for a gymkhana. Also, Mr Shinde has agreed to provide counter-guarantee to loans taken by three cooperative sugar factories despite a ban,â€™â€™ a Mantralaya official said.

The CMâ€™s defence is that his predecessor Vilasrao Deshmukh had taken the decision regarding the three sugar factories. â€œBut this decision could have been rescinded by Mr Shinde,â€™â€™ a Congress minister pointed out. The debt recovery tribunal had, in an unprecedented move, sought to attach two offices in Mantralaya for the recovery of loans given to a sugar factory.

According to indications, the government will present a soft budget in order to please farmers, who are facing a severe drought and power crisis, and the industry, which has been reeling under heavy taxes. Although the assembly elections in the state are scheduled only for October 2004, indications are that they may be preponed if the Congress does well in the forthcoming polls to the Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan assemblies.

Meanwhile, opposition leader Narayan Rane (Shiv Sena) has already set the tone for the proceedings by demanding that Veer Savarkarâ€™s portrait be installed within the assembly premises.

This is a tactical move as it will put both the Congress and the NCP on the defensive.

Mr Savarkar is an icon in Maharashtra and the ruling combineâ€™s opposition to the installation of his portrait in parliament recently will be fully exploited by the saffron alliance.

BJP vice-president Gopinath Munde is fresh from a whirlwind tour of rural Maharashtra and is expected to lead the attack on the twin issues of drought and power crisis. Farmers in rain-shadow areas in western Maharashtra have already resorted to â€˜rasta rokosâ€™ to highlight the water scarcity.

Gandhian Anna Hazare is also gearing up for an agitation to demand the immediate implementation of the Right to Information Act. Hazare has accused the government of backtracking on its promises given to him some months ago on the issue of empowering citizens with the right to information.

13,RSS women seek their own space in politics,"NAGPUR: Union parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj may be working hard to mobilise support for the Women''s Reservation Bill, which promises a third of seats in all legislatures to women. But the Rashtriya Sewika Samiti, the one lakh strong women''s wing of the RSS, is opposed to the idea.

Usha Sathe, the Sewika Samiti pramukh since 1974, says, ""In principle, we don''t oppose reservation, but in this case, it is not necessary. Reservation is meant for the weak or disabled. We should be strong enough to find a place for ourselves.""

But hasn''t reservation in politics become necessary because men, who dominate parties, deny women their fair share? ""Well, it is true that men don''t want women to come forward,"" she says, but adds that some women â€” including a few from the Sevika Samiti''s ranks like union ministers Sumitra Mahajan and Jaywantiben Mehta â€” have made it on their own.

In this quiet by-lane in Dhantoli, near the RSS headquarters at Keshavbagh, in Ahilya Bhawan, the Sewika Samiti''s centre of activities, it is clear that the gender gap between the RSS â€” which still excludes women from its membership â€” and its women''s wing has not diminished over the years.

Sathe recalls that when the Sewika Samiti was formed in 1937 by Laxmibai Kerkar of Wardha, Sangh''s founding sarsanghchalak K B Hegdewar was far from encouraging.

15,"Cong, SAD men clash","RAMPURA PHOOL: Tension among supporters of Congress and SAD (B) candidates was witnessed on Sunday in almost all wards of Rampura Phool town of Bathinda, where candidates supported by former power minister Sikander Singh Malooka and his arch rival Gurpreet Singh Kangar were pitted against each other.

Though heavy police force was deployed at 10 of 17 wards after these were declared sensitive on Sunday, threat of violence continued to loom large at all 17 wards of the town till the conclusion of the election.

Scuffles and brawls between Congress and SAD (B) workers were witnessed at four places in the town and police had to resort to mild lathi charge at one place to disperse the mob.

In ward number 6, the situation turned tense at about 12 noon when a scuffle broke out between both parties'' workers as Akalis objected to the Congress'' candidates entering the polling booth. After the police used force to disperse the workers of both parties, the Akalis raised slogans.

The election commissioner ordered re-polling in booth numbers 7 and 8 of ward number 4, where three persons, allegedly supporters of Congress party candidate Gurtej Singh Rana, poured two jugs of black ink in ballot boxes after manhandling the presiding officer.

Sukhmander Singh, SDM of Rampura Phool and returning officer of the election, said that while two of the culprits, namely Sukhwinder Singh and Hardev Singh, were arrested on the spot, the third, Sukhi, was absconding. One of the accused is reportedly brother of the Congress candidate.

The returning officer said only 30 per cent votes were cast at the time of the incident, around 11.45 am, and the re-election in the ward would be held on March 12.

16,Union demands more farms in Bengal,"TAMLUK: The Krishi Khamar employees Union has demanded an increase in the number of agricultural farms in the state.

The union has strongly criticised the negligent attitude of the West Bengal government towards the present farms. It has alleged that the farmers are facing trouble for want of sufficient number of farms. There are only 13 agricultural farms in East and West Midnaporre combined.

Even these are run with a negligible number of staff, due to which their proper functioning was being adversely affected.

The union, in its 23rd district conference for undivided Midnapore held at Panskura during the weekend, adopted resolutions to press the government for increasing the number of farms and for the appointment of more employees to take better care of them.
