0,Villages up on development work,"PANCHKULA: As the urban areas continue to suffer, the villages falling within the municipal limits enjoy the benefits of certain levies collected from them.

As per an official information, development works worth Rs 30 lakh are in progress in at least 12-odd privileged villages falling within the city.

The Municipal Council (MC) has collected over Rs 7 crore as revenue from various levies since its inception in January 2001. Surprisingly, the MC or the district administration always has an excuse of inadequate staff and lack of infrastructure when confronted with the question of non-existent development work in the city. Sources say the MC officials are, however, tight-lipped when asked about its partial attitude in carrying out development works only in the villages, as a result of which urbanites are often compelled to approach the chief ministerâ€™s office for any kind of work in their area.

â€œThese development works were announced by the Haryana chief minister during Sarkar Aapke Dwar programme. Since panchayats of these villages have been absolved following the inception of the MC, we had to carry out these works in the villages.â€� These are the words of the district administration and the MC officials whenever they are inquired about the matter. In addition to construction and maintenance of roads and streets within the villages, construction of community centres and classrooms at the schools is one of the projects being undertaken by the council in the villages, add the sources.

â€œMC shall take over the maintenance works once the sectors are officially transferred to the council,â€� a senior MC official told Times News Network. â€œHouse tax or collection of other levies cannot be linked with the development work, as the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) maintains the sectors of the city,â€� says MC executive officer OP Sihag. â€œThe amount collected is very much with us that will be utilised on development works after we take over the city,â€� maintains Sihag.

1,Kanpur student commits suicide after ragging,"KANPUR: A 19-year-old first year engineering student Anup Kapoor committed suicide on Thursday by hanging himself from a ceiling fan at his house here. He had returned home from his institute in Lucknow following sexual harassment and mental torture by his seniors.

A bright student, Anup had joined the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) on September 2. Though, according to the rules, first-year students donâ€™t get entry into the hostel, he was allotted a room in the Anand Villa hostel.

In his suicide note, Anup said that he was going through mental agony due to the sexual harassment by second-year students of the institute in the name of ragging.

The note said that on some occasions, the seniors dragged the first-year students out from their rooms, took them to a room, asked them to strip down and play â€˜â€˜kabaddiâ€™â€™. It said the physical and mental torture of the first-year students did not end just there.

The maternal aunt of the victim, Dr Gita Seth, said that Anup had complained several times about the harassment to the warden of the Anand Villa hostel and IET officials. She said that Anup had also said he did not want to continue his education in the institute.

Paras Nath Kapoor, Anupâ€™s father and a teacher, cursed the instituteâ€™s administration with tears in his eyes, â€˜â€˜It was my fault that I couldnâ€™t guess the gravity of torture Anup was experiencing in the name of ragging in his institute.â€™â€™

Anupâ€™s mother, Manju Kapoor, a school teacher, was not in a condition to say anything except for chanting Anupâ€™s name.

Anup had qualified in the MLNR and CBSE entrance tests last year and had also topped the list in Rohilkhand Universityâ€™s engineering examination. However, he wanted to join a high-ranking institute. He had left the MLNR seat as he wanted mechanical engineering course. When he got it at the IET, Lucknow, he decided to join there.

The police said Anup took â€˜â€˜this extreme step due to the agony of ragging by seniorsâ€™â€™.

4,RJD spokesperson seeks Nitish Kumar's arrest,"PATNA: RJD spokesperson Shivanand Tiwari has demanded arrest of Union minister Nitish Kumar and the chairman of the Railway Board for criminal negligence of the railway bridge.

Citing a letter, Tiwari said the senior divisional manager II, Mughalsarai, had recommended immediate repair of the railway bridge over Dhawa river and restrictions on the movement of trains. Tiwari said the letter was written on April 30 this year.

â€œThis letter exposes the lie of Nitish Kumar about the bridge, and I am ready to quote on affidavit this letter, which says that the wooden sleepers were in a bad shape and the pillar needed to be strengthened,â€� he said.

Tiwari said had the railways abided by the caution recommended in this letter, the tragic accident of Rajdhani Express could have been avoided. â€œThe railway accident was a mass murder,â€� he said, insisting that during the rescue work, the railways had not bothered to break the windows of the air conditioned compartments, which led to many of the passengers dying due to suffocation.

Tiwari said the theory of sabotage promoted by the railways was just a ploy to hide their lapses. â€œIt is not physically possible to remove two fishplates and a 13-metre rail track within 40 minutes,â€� he said, adding that the railway officials had planted the rail track and fishplates after the accident to save their own skin.

â€œThe Gaya SP told me that the rail track put on the accident site was rusted and had not been used,â€� he claimed. He said the claim made by the chairman of the railway board that the accident was the work of the ISI was a flight of imagination. Meanwhile, state law minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan, after his return from the accident site, demanded a probe by an independent body into the reasons behind the accident. He alleged that the officials had not taken interest in speeding the rescue work.

5,Irate law examinees go on rampage in Patna,"PATNA: The LLB part I examinees of Patna University took law into their hands on Friday and ransacked the Science College examination centre in protest against the expulsion of two examinees. The irate examinees damaged the car of the PU vice-chancellor and damaged college property worth over Rs 50,000.

The trouble began when vice-chancellor K K Jha accompanied by the examination controller of PU, visited the Science College examination centre and caught two examinees using unfair means. Both the examinees were expelled from the examination and handed over to the police as per the provisions of the Examination Conduct Act.

As soon as the examinees came to know about the expulsion of students, they tore off the question papers and answer books, broke the furniture of gymnasium, and ransacked boysâ€™ common room and girlsâ€™ common room of Science College.

The magistrate and police posted at the centre remained mute spectators to the disturbance created by the examinees. The examinees also tried to attack the administrative building and other departments of the college, but the timely arrival of the Vajra van brought the situation under control.

The examinees also went to the other examination centres but they could not disturb the examination there.

6,VMC meet suspended due to Oppn protests,"VIJAYAWADA: Mayor P Anuradha suspended the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation Council meeting till Sept. 16 after the opposition blocked the proceedings at Fridayâ€™s meeting.

Corporators belonging to the Congress, CPI and CPM gheraoed the mayor soon after the latter suspended the meeting under Section 89 (2) of the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act. They strongly objected to the manner in which the meeting was abruptly suspended and raised slogans deploring the mayorâ€™s attitude. Later, the mayor announced that she would do the same thing if the corporators persisted with similar unruly behaviour.

Trouble started soon after the meeting began around 10.30 am as the corporators objected to the presence of police personnel outside the new council hall. They pleaded with the mayor, who was in the chair, to ask the police to leave the VMC premises. The mayor then directed commissioner Praveen Prakash to ask the police to leave.

However, the 200-strong police force did not move out as hundreds of protesters belonging to Congress, CPI and CPM stormed the VMC office. The commissioner came out of the council hall and reportedly asked assistant commissioner of police P Krishna Rao to send city Congress president Kadiyala Butchi Babu away from the VMC premises.

The protesters held a dharna in front of the council hall demanding that the authorities drop the moves to privatise marriage halls and sell shopping complexes. The mayor adjourned the council meeting for five minutes to receive a memorandum from the protesters.

As the mayor came out of the council hall, deputy mayor Venkata Satyanarayana, standing committee chairman Y Srinivasa Rao and other Congress leaders strongly protested the commissionerâ€™s attitude and demanded that he apologise to the city Congress president. Praveen Prakash clarified he did not say anything against him.

The Congress leaders submitted a memorandum opposing the VMCâ€™s moves and dispersed. The CPI and CPM leaders, on the other hand, handed over one lakh signatures collected from the people against the VMCâ€™s moves to the mayor and the commissione.

When the meeting resumed, coopted member Samanthapudi Narsaraju referred to his arrest by the Satyanarayanapuram police when he objected to the demolition of illegal structures at Madhuranagar recently. The mayor did not allow discussion as it was sub judice.

7,Fake ‘ambassador of God’ arrested,"HYDERABAD: The police on Friday arrested a software trainer-turnedgodman, who claimed to be an â€œAmbassador of Godâ€�, on charges of fomenting communal trouble and cheating the public.

Mohammad Maodoudi Ahmed Khan, a twice-married man residing at Tolichowki, also claimed at a press conference where additional police commissioner A K Khan announced his arrest, that he is the Man of the Millennium and believes in the trinity of Islam, Hinduism and Christianity.

The additional commissioner said 30-year-old Ahmed, fluent in English, was an intermediate dropout and was apparently suffering from some psychological disorders.

The police official said several people had complained to the police control room that Ahmed was making telephone calls saying he possessed supernatural powers and promised to change their fate on paying amounts ranging from Rs 1,100 to Rs 11,000. Based on the complaints, the west zone task force team and Langar Houz police raided Ahmedâ€™s house at Mogul Residence and nabbed him. A video camera and some other incriminating material was also seized.

Additional commissioner Khan said Ahmed was an accused in a cheating case registered at Chaderghat police station in 1998. Ahmed collected huge amounts from different students on the pretext of providing IT-education, but failed to start the venture. Asked why he cheated the students, Ahmed said it was only a charge and that he had learnt from the mistake.

Md Abraruddin, a resident of Malakpet where Ahmed stayed for five years before moving to the Tolichowki house, testified that Ahmed had a psychopathic tendency in the past.

8,Cong dares CM for joint inspections on farm sector,"HYDERABAD: Reiterating its charge that the assured nine-hour supply was not being given to farm sector, the AP Congress Committee (PCC) on Friday dared the government, to come forward for joint inspections to ascertain the ground realities.

â€œThe visit should not be a pre-arranged one. Let them (the government) decide the time and Iâ€™m prepared to come and the venue should be decided then and there itself,â€� PCC chief spokesman K Rosaiah said.

Speaking to reporters here, Rosaiah alleged that despite tall claims by the government, farmers continued to face frequent interruptions even in the nine hour supply, which was resulting in drying up of their crops. â€œWhile this was amply evident in different districts, the government is remaining indifferent to the issue,â€� he said.

Recalling the agitation launched by former chief minister NT Rama Rao and N Chandrababu Naidu, demanding 18-hour supply to farm sector when the TDP was in opposition, he said that the same Naidu was now harping on nine-hour supply which, however, was not being provided. The government itself has admitted that there were interruptions in power supply on several occasions.

Rosaiah said that there were irregularities to the tune of more than Rs 540 crore in FFW going by the governmentâ€™s admission that there were about 10 to 20 per cent irregularities.

9,WUA election issue still hanging fire,"HYDERABAD: The state government continues to drag its feet on the issue of holding elections, to water users associations (WUAs) which has been hanging fire for long.

Though the cabinet had decided to amend the law by issuing an ordinance, to date, it has not yet sent it for the governorâ€™s approval. According to official sources, the issue is pending with the law department. The sources point out that it might take at least about a week, before the ordinance is sent to the governor for approval.

It may be mentioned here that the issue had figured in the state Assembly and following a vociferous demand by the opposition, the government had assured that it would hold the elections soon. It took nearly two months for the government to take a decision to amend the act.

A cabinet sub-committee was constituted for the purpose, which had recommended that members of these associations be nominated by the process of consensus. But the cabinet decided that elections should be held by ballot.

However, the sources say that the ground work for holding of elections â€œat the earliestâ€�, had begun and certain large associations have been divided into small ones and it had identified the places under agency areas where new associations have to be formed.

The sources further said that work on revision of electoral rolls had also begun and once the government issues the ordinance, notification could be issued. All the officials in the districts have been asked to be prepared.

10,Congress to nail govt on projects,"HYDERABAD: Encouraged by the public response to its campaign on the â€˜unfulfilled promisesâ€™ made by chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, the Congress has decided to intensify its agitation by focussing on the governmentâ€™s â€˜failureâ€™ in executing irrigation projects in the state.

The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) campaign will be flagged off by APCC president M Satyanarayana Rao at Nandyal on September 16.

Congress leaders led by CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy will plant trees around the foundation stones laid for various pending projects. The gesture is meant to protect the foundation stones and remind the government of the promises it made to the people. The Congress has decided to involve the party rank and file in the campaign.

â€œThere are no politics involved in the campaign. As an opposition party, we are doing our duty to expose the indifference of the government to its own promises,â€� Rajasekhara Reddy said. Speaking to The Times of India, Reddy came down heavily on the chief minister for ignoring a host of promises he made to the people. â€œMany of these promises concern irrigation.

It has become a practice for this government to make promises and lay foundation stones for irrigation projects and conveniently forget them once the elections are over,â€� he alleged.

Asked about the Telugu Desam Partyâ€™s (TDP) criticism of the Congress for politicising developmental issues, the CLP leader said: â€œIt is our duty to expose the governmentâ€™s indifference in solving the peopleâ€™s problems.â€� The CLP leader criticised the chief minister for â€˜not respondingâ€™ to the peopleâ€™s problems in the drought-hit districts.

As regards the several works taken up under the Food-for-Work (FFW) programme, he said that the government was trying to â€œconceal the largescale irregularities being committed by ruling party leaders and cadres.â€�

â€œThough the Central government is aware of the irregularities, it is afraid because of the crucial support extended to it by the TDP,â€� he said, adding that if it was really committed to curbing irregularities, the government could have considered Congress party suggestions like ordering a probe into the affairs of rice mills which would have brought out the facts.

â€œTDP government is conveniently forgetting its promises made to the people. â€™â€™

In the violence property worth lakhs of rupees were damaged following burning and looting of over 100 shops. A car and two motorbikes were also set fire. Dusk-to-dawn curfew has been imposed in the town and shoot-at- sight orders have been issued against those indulging in violence.

Violence erupted on Saturday afternoon when a frenzied mob, irked over the attack on youths, ganged up and started attacking shops in the town.

According to sources, on Saturday, the youth brought his supporters in a lorry and attacked people who teased the girl. In this clash, three youths were injured.

14,"SC, ST schools to get govt grants","BANGALORE: The state government has decided to sanction grant-in-aid for schools run and managed by Scheduled Castes and Tribes.

Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.K. Chandrasekhar on Saturday said the grant-in-aid will apply to schools established between June 1, 1987, and March 31, 1992. ``We have laid down guidelines for selecting schools which apply for grants. The institutions will be subjected to thorough scrutiny before sanctioning grants.''''

Some of the guidelines include existence of the institution during the stipulated period, 50 per cent of teaching and non-teaching staff, besides students should belong to SC/ST. ``These schools should have minimum infrastructure and should have performed well academically too. Their accounting must be unquestionable,'''' the minister said.

The state government has set up district monitoring committees which will begin identifying the schools. The committees will process applications from the institutions which apply for grant-in-aid before submitting it to respective deputy directors of Public Instruction (DDPIs), he said.

15,"Women corporators reign, husbands rule","BANGALORE: Ask them anything. ``Ask my husband,'''' is their standard reply.

Behind every ignorant woman corporator, there is a smart husband it seems. He is His Master''s Voice. No remote control here...he calls the shots. Welcome to some BCC wards where women corporators firmly believe that ignorance is bliss.

``Ward? Which ward? Problems? What problems?'''' They chorus.

Forget potholes, overflowing drains and all that rubbish. Don''t tax the women corporators with these mundane problems. After all, they are there only as figureheads. ``Poor things, they''re uneducated'''' ... ``They are just housewives,'''' say the party bosses who put them in the saddle. ``How can she meet strangers and study problems of an area,'''' they ask.

Ward 3 - Yeshwantpur - Mahalakshmi Venkatesh (JD-U); Ward 17 - Vrishabhavatinagar - Chandramma (JD-S); Ward 18 - Kamakshipalya - Revamma (Cong); Ward 25 - Ramachandrapura - Lakshmi Nagaraj (Ind); Ward 28 - Chickpet - Gayathri Ramachandra (BJP); Ward 29 - Cottonpet - N. Gowramma (JD-S); Ward 31 - Binnypet - Mahadevamma (Cong); Ward 19 - Basaveshwaranagar - Umavathi Padmaraj (BJP). These are the clueless ones.

Why blame them? During ward election time, political parties persuade the woman candidate to contest under the women''s quota, ensuring that it is their party that reigns in a particular ward. They promise her that post elections, she needn''t bother her head about the problems in the ward.

Naturally, these women corporators, here to stay for a five-year term, are quite oblivious to their responsibilities.

It might be her photograph on the election campaign posters. But it is the husband''s face residents get to see. The husband handles the finance, braves the public. He gives (or does not give) orders for developmental activities.

The corporator''s job is easy. She just has to obey him when he says `follow me''.

Ask for Mahadevamma of Binnypet, and her husband Nagaraj says, ``Yes, tell me.'''' But you really want to speak to the corporator of the ward. ``No, you can ask me whatever you want. She is unavailable,'''' is the answer again. Same is the case with Gayathri Ramachandra of Chickpet.

Perhaps, they fear that the wife could blurt out a detail that could land them in trouble. For, they know she knows nothing about problems in the area or how to combat them. So they do and say everything to keep her conversation with the public to a minimum. ``She''s very shy, not used to outside company, leave her alone,'''' says Basaveshwaranagar corporator Umavathi Padmaraj''s brother.

If they happen to answer the doorbell or phone about a ward enquiry, they promptly hand it over to the husband. ``What ward, what problems, I don''t know anything. Speak to my husband,'''' Vrishabhavatinagar corporator Chandramma said.

16,All-party meet: IHRO to move SC over SYL,"LUDHIANA: The all-party meeting convened here on Saturday to take holistic view of the issue of Punjabâ€™s right to its rivers water decided to file a writ petition in the Supreme Court over the issue.

It also passed a resolution urging the state government to call a special session of the state Assembly to reject all past agreements and decisions because they violated the stateâ€™s constitutional right on the issue.

At the same time, the meeting urged the state government to serve notice to Haryana and Rajasthan state governments to arrange for their irrigation requirements because Punjab would not be in a position to spare any water after 10 years from now in view of its own mounting requirements.

Interestingly, despite invitation no Congress party representative turned up at the meeting convened by International Human Rights Organisation (IHRO). Senior SAD leader and former finance minister Captain Kanwaljit Singh was present. A number of political parties, including the non-political organisations in the state, attended the meeting.

The IHRO chairperson DS Gill said all the representatives attending the meeting had authorised the IHRO to move the court in this regard.

They said that there was a consensus among the representatives that the apex courtâ€™s orders on the issue so far were given in terms of certain political agreements. The court had not taken into account the existing constitutional provisions in this regard, they said.

Asserting Punjabâ€™s right over Bakhra and Beas headworks, a resolution was passed urging the state government to disband Bakhra Beas Management Board without delay because it was foisted on the state through illegal and extra- constitutional way, Gill said.

17,Home minister praises police for peaceful bandh,"BANGALORE: Home Minister Mallikarjun Kharge has complimented the Bangalore city police for maintaining law and order during the `Bangalore Bandh'' on September 12 called to protest against the release of Cauvery waters to Tamil Nadu.

Addressing a press conference in the police commissioner''s office on Saturday, Kharge said the police have protected the property and lives of Bangaloreans during the bandh.

Bandhs called in the past on the Cauvery issue had turned violent causing enormous damage to property and disturbance in the city.

Kharge said that the city police headed by Police Commissioner H.T. Sangliana are doing good work. Several incidents of murders and robberies reported in the last few weeks have affected the city''s residents. ``I am confident that Sangliana and his men will solve these cases,'''' he added. He advised Sangliana to form special squads to detect these cases.

Kharge was in the police commissioner''s office on Saturday to have a look at Rs 25 lakh worth of property recovered from a criminal arrested by the Banasawadi police. He announced a cash reward of Rs 50,000 to the police team headed by Inspector H. Siddappa for nabbing the criminal.

Responding to a question that the morale of the police force was generally down because a set of police officers have hijacked him to bag `key and lucrative'' police stations and postings in the city, Kharge said: ``Nobody can hijack me, not even in their dreams.''''

Commenting on the allegations that round-the-year transfers were affecting the work in police stations, Kharge said: ``Because of promotions and other transfers, posts are falling vacant and we are filling them up.''''

Kharge, reacting to a question on political interference in transfers, said he gets requests for postings not just from the politicians, but from a host of others including journalists.

He refused to comment on a particular police inspector bagging `lucrative'' postings throughout his career. This inspector had served in the busy Upparpet police station for five years, posted to Hanumanthanagar for three months and finally brought back to Ashoknagar police station which controls the maximum number of liveband restaurants and other joints in the limits.

18,Shanta's absence from BJP rally raises eyebrows,"SHIMLA: The absence of Union rural development minister Shanta Kumar, who represents the Kangra parliamentary segment, from the BJP rally addressed by party national president M Venkaiah Naidu at Sundernagar in Mandi district on Saturday has raised quite a few eyebrows in political circles here.

Though the party leaders had ensured that most of the frontline supporters of the former chief minister were present at the rally to prevent any confusion from percolating down the rank and file, the fact that Shanta himself was not present on the occasion has not been taken well.

Speculations were rife for the last few days after posters of the rallies were seen in Sundernagar. The posters were conspicuous in as much that they did not carry the photograph or name of Shanta Kumar.

Party sources here said that the fact that Shanta Kumar would not be present at the rallly was a reason why his name and photograph had been left out from the posters. â€˜â€˜He had a commitment to attend an international seminar on development which is being held in Delhi and as such he could not be present for todayâ€™s rallyâ€™â€™, they clarified.

However, they confided that Saturdayâ€™s rally at Sundernagar was to herald the party election campaign for elections to the state assembly scheduled for March next year, and the party national president was to officially announce that if the party retained power Prem Kumar Dhumal would again be the chief minister in Himachal.

â€˜â€˜Perhaps the party central leadership did not feel it appropriate to make the announcement in the presence of Shanta Kumar and as such the former chief minister had preferred to remain away. Sentiments and feelings can get aroused causing unruly scenes and sloganeering, which would have been disastrousâ€™â€™, they added.

They said that the leadership also wanted to ensure that the absence of Shanta Kumar was not misconstrued as a divide in the party, which was why all the close supporters of the former chief minister were present at the rally. Speakers at rally also refrained from making any mention of differences in opinion on the state leadership.

Party sources said that the Congress had been time and again raising the issue of a divide in the BJP in the state in the Shanta and Dhumal camps. The absence of Shanta Kumar could have further reinforced this allegation, but by assuring that all Shantaâ€™s supporters were present this had been taken care of, they added.

19,Man arrested for raping four-year-old,"PUNE: The Deccan police have arrested a 35-year-old liquor shop employee on charges of raping a four-and-a-half-year old girl residing at Vishnukripanagar near Shivajinagar bus stand.

Acccording to assistant police inspector S.P. Beldar of the Shivajinagar police chowky, Damu Popat Mhaske, the childâ€™s neighbour, was arrested and booked under Section 376 (5) (6) of the Indian Penal Code on Thursday night, after the girlâ€™s mother named him in a complaint earlier in the day.

The shocking incident comes within weeks of a three-and-a-half-year oldâ€™s molestation by her school bus operator and the rape of a 17-year-old college girl on university campus by a man posing as a police officer. The third incident happened on Tuesday, but the child told her mother about it only on Thursday, when she started feeling extreme discomfort.

The girl is undergoing treatment at the Sassoon general hospital where she was admitted on Thursday. Speaking to TNN on Friday, the girlâ€™s mother said Mhaske used to treat the girl like his daughter.

20,Free and fair polls last chance in J&K: Jethmalani,"PUNE: Describing the forthcoming assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) as the last chance for an amicable solution, Ram Jethmalani, president, Kashmir committee, blasted politicians for â€œlacking sincerityâ€� in solving the vexed issue over the years.

Speaking at a packed Symbiosis Vishwabhavan auditorium on Friday, the former law minister applauded the All-Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC) for abandoning the extreme separatist stand, â€œwhich was inimical to an honourable and lastingâ€� solution in J&Kâ€�. â€œBut our wooden-headed political leaders, however, have not reciprocated the way they should have,â€� he thundered in an obvious reference to the Central leadership.

In a rare attack, seeking the root of the problem, Jethmalani criticised political leaders for their intransigence and hypocrisy. â€œOur leaders, whom we have defined as Gods, have contributed to the creation of the problem, as a fall-out of which generation after generation must suffer for their sins which we have never critically examined,â€� he said.

â€œThe Kashmiris have genuine grievances, and the ensuing election, held in a free-and-fair manner, would be the best platform to win their hearts,â€� he said. The disturbed state never had free and fair polls since 1977, he added Terming the Simla agreement as a â€œsuicidal actâ€�, he ridiculed the political leaders for being spectators to the â€œsilentâ€� parts in the agreement.

21,Farooq rules out post-election alliances,"NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Saturday said the National Conference would not enter into alliance with any political party in case of a fractured verdict in the assembly elections.

""If we do not have an absolute majority after the polls, we will prefer to sit in Opposition rather than align with any political party,"" Abdullah told newspersons here.

On the All Party Hurriyat Conferenceâ€™s proposal on the Kashmir issue, Abdullah offered help to its chairman Abdul Gani Bhat for facilitating his travel to Pakistan if he wanted Kashmirâ€™s merger with that country.

""I read that Bhat has stated that there are only two options for solving the Kashmir dispute, a merger with India or Pakistan,"" Abdul lah told newspersons here. ""I would like to know which is his (Bhatâ€™s) option. If it is Pakistan then I offer him to be sent with his bag and baggage to Pakistan through road,"" Abdullah said. Expressing unhappiness over Bhatâ€™s knowledge of history, Abdullah said,

""The question of merger ended in 1947 when Kashmir decided to become an integral part of India.""
