0,No fire fighting equipment GDA high-rises,"ghaziabad: the residents of the 21 high-rise buildings in ghaziabad development authorityâ€™s kaushambi complex have been inhabiting what could be called death traps for the past several years. with the fire fighting equipment defunct in the 21 towers, 17 of which are 15 storey high and four are ten storey high, the complex has become a source of nightmares for not only the residents but also the fire department officials who have declared the buildings unsafe several times. this despite the fact that the residents have paid about rs 3 crore to the gda over the years for the maintenance of the equipment. they claim the machinery was only partially installed and never maintained. â€˜â€˜recently there was fire in a groundfloor flat in udaigiri tower, but the fire fighting system at the site was not working. we doused the flames on our own. last year a fire broke out in an eighth floor flat of anoter tower, the onsite equipment was again defunct,â€™â€™ a ghaziabad fire service source said. the residents claim the maintenance fee charged from them was â€˜â€˜shared by the contractors and officials of the gdaâ€™â€™. satpura tower residentsâ€™ welfare association president retired air vice-marshal d k gupta had demanded a probe into the matter from the chief vigilance commissioner of india, and also demanded that the maintenance fee charged from residents be refunded. â€˜â€˜the gda has charged the residents for maintenance of the equipment from 1993 to september 2000. the amount recovered adds up to about rs 3 crore. the one bedroom apartment allottee was charged rs 125 per month, while the two and three bedroom flat allottees paid rs 200 and rs 250, respectively,â€™â€™ said v k mittal, the new rwa chief. but whatâ€™s makes matters more alarming is the fact that ghaziabad fire service does not have a snorkel to fight fires in high-rise buildings. ghaziabad police sources said the gda has repeatedly been issued notices to get fire equipment in its high-rise buildings operational. the latest notice was issued earlier this month. a police official explained: â€˜â€˜about 80 per cent of the equipment was installed by the gda. but it was never properly maintained. fire fighting equipment become useless very quickly if not maintained.â€™â€™ the official said the gda wants to hand over the maintenance of the equipment to the residents. but the residents want it to be in a working condition before they take it over. but gda secretary u n thakur said: â€˜â€˜much of the equipment has already been handed over to the residents. but they want it to meet the new official norms.â€™â€™

1,Brits want Prince to marry Camilla,"london: barely a week after the funeral of the queen mother, britainâ€™s last royal link with victorian morality and tradition, the countryâ€™s best-selling tabloid says its 10 million readers want prince charles to make an honest woman of his mistress, camilla parker-bowles, with ""a ring on her finger"". with a screaming lead headline ""marry"" and an editorial advising the prince to ""follow his heart"", the tabloid says ""it is no longer a question of if, but when"". the paper, which quotes a recent opinion poll showing a hefty 57 per cent support for the marriage, says that royal courtiers are more concerned now about the choice of title for parker-bowles. the only consensus, suggests the tabloid, is that it will not be that of â€˜queenâ€™ or â€˜princess of walesâ€™, both of which would bring back too many memories of the adored diana and raise constitutional or religious objections. the sunâ€™s endorsement is not final by any means but is evidence of the growing view across britain that parker-bowles should be accepted as charlesâ€™s wife, though not queen. with britainâ€™s so-called ""quality"" broadsheet newspapers increasingly chronicling the activities of charles and camilla as if they were already man and wife, the opinion of the masses is regarded as crucial. the sun , which routinely and bombastically declares that it is the voice of the nation and ""it is the sun wot won"" tony blair the crucial 1997 general election after 18 years of conservative party rule, is seen as a blue-collar barometer. but its campaigns, such as over the single european currency and paedophiles, are generally considered a lot less attention-grabbing than the salacious topless page 3, which has become almost a byword for the tabloid. after the 1997 death of diana, the paper claimed to speak for all of britain when it whipped up republican sentiments by criticising the queen and lauding as a saint the princess it routinely photographed with and without her knowledge. now, says the paper, ""backing has never been stronger"" and it advises charles to ""seize the moment"" by marrying the woman he has loved for a quarter of a century. he could not do it while his grandmother, the queen mother was alive, says the paper, but her death was a turning point. parker-bowlesâ€™s presence as an invited guest at last weekâ€™s funeral and the queenâ€™s unprecedented audience with her last month at buckingham palace are seen as pointers to the future. after dianaâ€™s death, barely one person in three had a kind word to say about the princeâ€™s companion, while nearly half the population actively opposed the marriage. with the church of england contemplating a change in its rules against the remarriage of divorcees, constitutional experts increasingly believe the bells are likely to ring out soon enough for the most-watched royal wedding of them all.",london
2,Suspended principal may be prosecuted,"mumbai: mumbai university should ask the management of worliâ€™s watumull institute of technology to take action against suspended principal r.b. kulkarni, who was indicted in a sexual harassment case by a university inquiry panel, academicians have demanded. the panelâ€”which conducted the inquiry last octoberâ€” said that mr kulkarni caused ""embarrassment and discomfort"" to female students by ""cracking vulgar jokes, deliberately giving sexist examples relating to womenâ€™s clothing as illustrations for explaining his subject"" and ""generally patting them, which they dislike"". the teaching staff, meanwhile, complained to the committee that the ""principal makes sexually explicit remarks and cracks vulgar jokes in the presence of staff members..he asks them embarrassing and personal questions"". women on the non-teaching staff also told the committee that he ""passed comments about their appearances"". mr kulkarni could not be contacted for comment, but the watumull management said that an internal inquiry had exonerated him of blame. an official from the hyderabad sind national collegiate board, which runs the college, said that the management ordered the internal inquiry as soon as the complaints surfaced as they were ""very anxious to preserve the reputation of the college and the staff"". after student agitations, the college management sent mr kulkarni on long leave, but several academicians and students complained that this was inadequate. the national studentsâ€™ union of india-whose members blackened mr kulkarniâ€™s face when the complaints first surfaced last yearâ€” courted arrest on thursday to protest the inaction. ""sexual harassment is a serious offence, the university should write to the management and ask them to remove him (mr kulkarni) from service,"" said a member of the university senate, which includes teachers, students and principals. such a move would also help to create ""an atmosphere of trust in the college"", a senate member said.this was especially important at watumull where, according to the fact-finding committeeâ€™s report, students were reportedly scared of being victimised during examinations. the committee, comprising senate member madhu paranjape and l.s. raheja college principal r.a. heredia, stated in its report submitted last november that ""the confidentiality of the exam system has been severely compromised. students know that the in-charge principal sets the question papers and assesses the answer papers..they are afraid of being victimised and their confidence in the examination system has eroded."" the inquiry panel, which met mr kulkarni, students, teaching and non-teaching staff, said that female students did not lodge any formal complaints because they were afraid that mr kulkarni would sabotage their careers. based on the committeeâ€™s report and subsequent complaints from students, the university asked the college management to report what action had been taken, vice-chancellor b.l. mungekar told this newspaper. ""three days ago, i asked one of the trustees what action they had taken, but he hasnâ€™t replied so far,"" he said. the vice-chancellor further said that the university would take ""appropriate action"" according to the recommendation made by its womenâ€™s development cell, before which the report has been placed. however, the hyderabad sind board official said that watumullâ€™s management hadnâ€™t yet received a copy of the university report. because watumullâ€™s internal inquiry panel had reached a different conclusion, it was important to understand whether the university committee operated on different facts, the official said. he added,""perfectly sensible people will not arrive at different conclusions."" the directorate of technical education had also conducted an inquiry into the matter, but its report had not been forwarded to the management either, the official said.

3,Rly staff protest against notification,"danapur: employees of the danapur division of the eastern railway are up in the arms against the recent notification of the central board of direct taxes to bring free railway passes and privilege ticket orders (ptos) under the purview of income-tax . they have already launched a phasewise agitation in the division and held several meetings at different places under the banner of national federation of indian railways (nfir).

according to the members of the eastern railway men''s congress (ermc), about 15,000 employees of the division including drivers, guards and cabinmen will strike work for a day at the call of the recognised federations and associations of the railways if the notification is not withdrawan by may 15, 2002. though the final date to strike work all over the country is yet to be decided, railwaymen prefer to cease work either in july or august this year to put pressure on the government, members of the ermc said, adding that the most aggrieved employees including railway officials, are mentally prepared for a long battle with the government on this particular issue.

according to sources, federation of railway officers'' association (froa) and indian railway promotee officers'' federation (irpof) have joined hands for the first times with the group c and d employees'' association for a common cause which does affect the future career of all railwaymen.it is said that the all india rpf association has also threatened to cease work if the move to deduct taxes at source on the free passes and pto, is not immediately dropped by the government.

a large number of retired railway employees, particularly of the danapur division who are presently getting one or two set free passes, have threatened to `gherao'' raillway minister nitish kumar if the government does not withdraw the notification and the circulation of the railway board bearing the number f(x)1-2001/23/1 of february 6, 2002. they are likely to seek direct intervention of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee in the matter, said a senior member of the railway pensioners'' brotherhood of danapur.

it is pointed out that a large number of railway employees are working round the clock in adverse situations. for them, the facility of free passes and ptos is a great morale booster; it is being extended to them right from the inception of indian railways. thus, denial of this facility will have a telling impact upon the quality of work they perform in day-to-day life, it is said.

most of the aggrieved employees of the danapur division said that their payscales and remuneration were duly examined by five successive pay commissions. but none of them had ever said in the reports that these facilities should either be made taxable or withdrawn.

according to sources, railways intend to save about rs 20 to rs 30 crore each year which is being incurred by way of providing free passes and ptos to railway employees. while railway officials belonging to group a and b get six sets of free passes for themselves and their family members in a calendar year, group c and d employees are entitled to three sets of such passes and six sets of ptos. each set is valid for four months only, it is said.

it is no denying the fact that railway officials and employees are in no mood to relent this time and consider that the privilege once given to employees, can not be stopped or taken to be part of the salary income.

6,Cong using vote bank politics: BJP,"ahmedabad: the bjp has accused congress of resorting to minority-appeasement politics. leader of opposition in the ahmedabad municipal corporation (amc), dharmendra shah, has alleged that congress is resorting to vote-bank politics by appointing corporators from minority community as chairpersons and deputy chairpersons of civic committees. ""six months have passed since tenure of the 12 civic committees in amc expired but the compulsory reshuffle is yet to take place. of the 129 corporators in amc only 16 belong to the minority community and yet six civic committees of the total 12 are headed by corporators belonging to the minority community. in the standing committee too there are six representatives of the minority community including the chairman, badruddin sheikh, himself,"" said shah. he added, ""even the dalit corporators have been sidelined in this process. apart from khemchand solanki who is the deputy mayor, dalits have no other representation in the civic committees. a turbulence is imminent in the party''s rank and files once the compulsory committee-reshuffle takes place and thus congress is delaying the process even though it is a gross violation of municipal norms.""

7,For riot victims battle shifts to courts,"ahmedabad: for victims of riots, it''s now a new battle zone. after going through the pangs of facing the continuous bouts of violence, it is now time to find their way out of the labyrinths of law courts as firs have begun to be drawn up and cases being admitted. and, more and more victims are now depending on the legal cells being operated by members of both the communities. advocates joining panels formed by different political parties and organisations are working overtime to deal with cases of riot victims and rioters in lower courts and in the gujarat high court. the bjp and the congress, relief organisations, agencies and individual lawyers have also taken initiative to fight for the riot victims, a task, they say, that is turning out to be monumental. they have started helping lodge firs in police stations, and file petitions and applications in courts. an advocate has already written to the chief secretary, additional chief secretary, and chairman of the national human rights commission and inspector of dariapur police station complaining about the bandh call of february 28. father cedric prakash, one of the local convenors of citizens for justice and peace said a large number of advocates from gujarat and outside are looking into cases at high court and supreme court levels. ""there are legal experts from hindu, muslim and other communities who are offering their services for victims from all communities,"" he said. ""the stress is on releasing children below 14 and people above 50,"" he said. the congress, however, is yet to put its act together as many belonging to the congress-announced panel of advocates for riot victims admit that they have not been given any brief and do not know much about the appointment. leading advocate and congressman krishnakant vakharia told tnn that ""it is under the process of organisation and it will be some time before it starts functioning."" meanwhile, a number of muslim advocates have started taking up cases at individual level. organisations like cell for legal help and guidance of the islami relief committee has appointed a panel comprising 11 advocates to deal with cases at lower and sessions courts and of three advocates to deal with cases in the high court. ""it is evident from past experience that rioters often go scotfree due to lack of evidence. taking this point into consideration, three panels of advocates have been formed. these panels will work specially for the cases like sardarpura, panderwada, kediyad, naroda-patia, where mass killings have taken place. this panel of advocates will work out and see that the criminals are punished by the courts,"" says its administrator dr shakeel ahmed. ""as of now, there are about 500 bail applications pending before the gujarat high court. but in other courts, thousands of applications must have been dealt with at local levels,"" said advocate vijay patel who chairs the bjp''s legal cell. ""thousands of hindus have met us for legal advice. about 10 residential societies including rachana society had offered financial assistance, but we refused,"" he elaborates while talking about people''s response. patel also offered to provide legal help to the muslims affected in riots as well, as he was ""committed to social service."" however, he clarified that ""we have not set up any particular panel to deal with such cases. we already have a legal cell at every taluka level. appointments are made every one and a half year.""

10,TRS seeks package for farmers,"warangal: telangana rashtra samithi (trs) president k chandrasekhar rao demanded that the state government offer a comprehensive relief package to hailstorm-affected farmers of telangana region. he demanded that the package should be similar to the cyclone relief packages offered in coastal andhra, and that the government should offer rs 1,200 per hectare to farmers of hailstorm-hit areas in the region. the trs chief told presspersons in warangal that nine telangana districts in the state were affected by hailstorm this year and according to preliminary estimates, the loss has been put at rs 500 crore. reiterating the demand, rao said that the present package announced by the government was an eyewash. he asked the government to reimburse the insurance package to the farm sector and prove its sincerity in providing relief to the victims of hailstorm in the region. the trs chief came down heavily on the state government for its policy on electricity connections to the farm sector and asked the local representatives of the tdp whether they were in favour of the tatkal connection offered by the electricity companies. accusing the tdp government of adopting a â€˜thought policing systemâ€™ in the state through its high- profile publicity pattern, the trs leader said that the tdp regime could not even bring any industry to the state during its present tenure. the government was playing â€˜golmaalâ€™ politics and trying to divert the publicâ€™s attention with publicity-oriented policies, rao said. rao alleged that the chandrababu naidu government was encouraging corruption and it was not striving for the welfare of the commoner. while blaming the tdp government for the closure of several public sector undertakings (psus), the trs leader said his party would take up struggles highlighting the lapses of the state government in the coming days. the trs leader said that the party was organising a massive rally at nalgonda on april 27 on the eve of its formation day. trs vice-president mandadi satyanarayan reddy, secretaries madhusudhanachari, vijayarama rao, district incharge lakshmikantha rao, rural districtpresident kola janardhan, urban district chief amarender reddy and others were present on the occasion.

11,Gujarat riots worst ever in history,"ahmedabad: for all those who thought that the 1969 riots here could be the yardstick to measure the intensity of communal violence in the state, facts emerging from the ongoing riots may prove to be a rude shock. the violence that erupted from the attack on coach s-6 of the sabarmati express at godhra and gripped entire gujarat, has surpassed all that history has witnessed in gujarat and has become a benchmark in itself. while the 1969 riots lasted a mere 12 days, the current spell has touched the mark of 50 days. besides, rioting in 1969 was limited to 11 districts, now riots have affected 29 out of the redefined 30 districts. deaths, too, have shot up from 519 to 837 (reported), so have the figures of injuries from 1,028 to 2,159, damage to religious places from 140 to 547. damage to the property have shot up from rs 5 crore to rs 681 crore, while the number of offences registered has gone up from 858 to 3,430. number of persons rendered homeless has gone up from 27,750 to 1.25 lakh (still increasing). and there seems no end to this, as the violence continues...

12,Govt. to formulate ‘model’ bylaws,"pune: the city on april 21, will host a crucial meeting of representatives from the over 28,000 credit cooperatives in the state and officials of the state cooperatives department. announcing this at a press conference on tuesday, state commissioner and registrar of co-operatives ratnakar gaikwad said the state government was in the process of formulating new bylaws to streamline the functioning of credit-co-operatives. the proposed bylaws seek to protect the interests of millions of common investors, while offering more operational flexibility to the co-operatives, he said. the new set of â€œmodel bylawsâ€� will be ready within a fortnight, he said. about the april 21 convention, he said, some 20,000 people are expected to attend the meet, which will be inaugurated by state irrigation minister (horticulture and mkvdc) ajit pawar. chief minister vilasrao deshmukh too is expected to address the concluding session, while union minister of state for finance balasaheb vikhe-patil too will speak on the occasion. more than 2.25 crore people have invested upwards of rs 24,000 crore in credit co-operatives across the state.the meet assumes special importance in view of a spate of scandals in credit-co-operatives which have jeopardised the savings of thousands of common investors. representatives of the credit co-operatives too expect to raise their long-standing concerns at the meet. these include, high-stamp duty, fixed credit exposure limit, said lalit gandhi, president of the state co-operativesâ€™ federation. â€œin fact a recommendation has been made in the model bylaws that co-operatives should be allowed to give loans and advances according to their deposits rather than fixing a common limit for everyone,â€� he said. another factor to be raised in front of cm is the differential treatment given by the cash-rich district cooperatives banks to the credit co-operative societies, gandhi said. under the present circumstances, depositors of cooperative socities do not get any insurance cover as they are not registered under the banking companies act.â€œa request would be made to vikhe-patil to bring the depositors of the credit co-operatives under a insurance cover by the depository corporation of india ltd,â€�he said.

14,Labour unrest mars industrial activity,"chandigarh: clouds of labour unrest continue to hang low over the industrial estate in panchkula which is home to over 300 small scale units engaged as ancillaries to larger units, mainly in the automobile sector. with three cases of labour problem reported in last three months, the industrial area here is rife with union activity. it is mostly the larger players like drish shoes and the state sector bharat electronics limited (bel) which have had to bear the brunt of trade union activity at some point in time or the other in the recent past. the continuing sluggishness of the economy has contributed to the present situation in a major way. the manufacturing units, feeling the pinch of dwindling orders, are looking for flexibility in terms of employment of workers. instead of direct employment, they are more interested in adopting 'contract manufacturing', with a greater flexibility on the hire and fire front.the union activity is greater among workers who have spent five years and above in a particular unit and are covered under the labour laws. on a visit to the industrial area on monday, times news network came across workers form two units staging protests. first was the demonstration in front of the drish shoes unit which has a total of 375 workers. the demonstration had been underway for the last five days.the issue:the workers not willing to sign a 'letter of good conduct' which bars employees from engaging in union activities. the union is affiliated to the all-india trade union congress (aituc). a few blocks away another group of five was staging a chain hunger strike.the company: surya pharmaceuticals. surya pharmaceuticals union general secretary amarpreet singh gill said, ''we have been victimised.the management has transferred all five officebearers of the employees union to their other plants at baddi and banur, knowing fully well that they are not in a position to relocate themselves.'' surya pharmaceuticals has over 80 workers on their rolls and the union is affiliated to the left oriented centre for india trade unions (citu). earlier, the employees of state owned bel had adopted the path of confrontation.the workers were not comfortable with the management decision regarding introduction of smart cards for marking attendance. ''they have not taken our consent before implementing the decision,'' the union leader had said. the issue was resolved subsequently but it highlights the extent of trade union activity in the industrial area. the individual unions here are affiliated to one or the other central trade unions. and the officebearers of these bodies take an active part in sorting out issues between the workers and the management. times news network witnessed the ongoing deliberations between drish shoes employee union and the company management, mediated by labour officer dharampal. however, it was an office-bearer of the aituc haryana state committee who dominated the negotiations which broke the impasse.

15,Cabinet defers decision on polls,"gandhinagar: the cabinet which met here on wednesday morning to discuss elections in the state deferred its decision to dissolve the assembly. earlier, sources said ""the obvious corollary of the meeting would be to dissolve the state assembly here immediately and seek polls latest by june 15."" another source close to modi said, ""the chief minister is of the firm opinion that there is no question of holding the polls in september or october. and, if polls are not held in june, they can well take place as scheduled, february 2003."" chairman of the programme implementation committee vijay rupani, a man from modi''s constituency, who looks into saurashtra affairs in the cmo had said, ""the issue of holding early polls will be discussed on wednesday in the cabinet, as proposed by the state unit of the party. there should be no dilemma regarding this. we also feel that holding polls in september or october will be as good as holding them as scheduled in february 2003."" however, there is a small section, comprising mainly those close to former chief minister keshubhai patel, who are not very keen on early polls as they feel that this would ""harm"" the state''s interests. ""it would send wrong signals if polls are held in the backdrop of communal tension. we must ensure that some development work, too, is done. it would be unwise to hold elections in june, when water crisis would be at its peak. we must also solve the power problem. these issues will require at least three months and most of the state machinery would be busy fighting scarcity,"" said a minister. meanwhile, the chief minister is showing keen interest for going fast on the developmental front that has come to a virtual standstill because of the riots. health minister ashok bhatt told tnn that the main development issues facing them were samras and gram sabha meetings. not without reason, for two days continuously, he held meetings with the water supplies department for ensuring that there is no water shortage in the state, even as reports came in that nearly 2,000 villages and major cities like rajkot might face a crisis.

16,"Dismiss Modi govt, say JD, CPM","bangalore: both factions of the janata dal (united and secular) and the communist party of india in karnataka have demanded the immediate dismissal of the modi government in gujarat and imposition of president''s rule in that state. in a memorandum to president k.r. narayanan which was submitted to karnataka governor v.s. ramadevi here on wednesday, the political parties have said that the gujarat violence was a clear case of persecution of the minorities. ``it is shameful and condemnable. even the prime minister, whose allegiance to the hindu fascist forces is well-known has declared the violence as a national shame,'''' the memorandum said. further, the reports of the national human rights commission (nhrc) and the national minorities commission lend enough support to the contention that there has been a total collapse of the constitution and rule of law in gujarat, the memorandum added.

17,New rules for vehicle licence plates,"kolkata: there is bad news for vehicle owners who have rushed to repaint their registration plates. sources in city police department claim that the plates would have to be replaced by authorised vendors and only after security checks. the rush to change the plates was unwarranted, they said. but almost 99 per cent of the commercial vehicles in the city have already changed their plates to yellow and around 40 per cent of the private vehicles have switched their plates into white. but under the new regulation, merely changing the colour of the plate and the lettering is not sufficient. the new number plates will have a unique security number, a hologram and a specially imprinted number, all of which is intended to make it much more difficult to use fake and forged number plates. the deadline for the change-over, planned in view of the increase in crimes involving vehicles, is the end of 2003. for the country-wide change to high-security number plates, special manufacturers and vendors are to be appointed. but though six german firms are learnt to have submitted their bids, no concrete shape has emerged. west bengal had done nothing so far to initiate the process. â€œ we are closely watching other states and trying to learn from their mistakes and experience,â€� said a police officer. next month onwards, school buses in the city will have to follow a set of new regulations, informed deputy commissioner (traffic police) m.k. singh on tuesday. â€œthis is actually an implementation of the apex courtâ€™s ruling given in 1997,â€� he added. a survey has revealed the buses to be unsafe. most buses do not even have bars on windows, it was found. according to new norms, a school bus driver must have more than five yearsâ€™ experience. keeping a fire-extinguisher and a first-aid box in a bus will be mandatory. there will have to be seat-belts. there must also be space for school bags under each seat. new norms also includes mandatory lettering â€“ â€˜school busâ€™ â€“ on all four sides of a bus, along with the phone number of the school. each school has to provide an â€˜attendantâ€™ for each bus. â€œto ensure safety of children, we will go to any extent â€“ right from prosecution to cancellation of licence and even cancellation of vehicle registration,â€� singh warned.
