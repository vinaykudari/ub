0,Parties gear up for civic body polls,"pune: even as the fear of dissolution looms large over the pune municipal corporation (pmc) in the light of action taken by the state government recently over former municipal commissioner arun bhatia's charges, political parties are gearing up for the polls, scheduled to be held early next year. the shiv sena held a meeting of its activists at ganesh kala krida manch on saturday. besides, other political parties are also planning to organise a series of programmes in the next few months in this regard. the sena meeting, which was addressed by the party's youth leader uddhav thackeray is seen as an attempt to mobilise the party machinery for the forthcoming pmc elections. according to reliable sources, saturday's meeting was the first in the series of meetings, camps and workshops to be organised on city and assembly segment levels. uddhav's presence at the meeting also assumes significance considering the recent comments by sena chief bal thackeray exhorting his nephew raj thackeray to concentrate on drawing cartoons at the moment, instead of indulging in politics. the development is being seen as an attempt to project uddhav as the second-in-command. the bjp, too, does not seem to be lagging behind its partner. the party has declared to hold a protest march under the leadership of former deputy chief minister gopinath munde to the pmc on july 21. the party has planned the march to push their demand that the portrait of rashtriya swayamsevak sangh founder keshav baliram hedgewar is not removed from the pmc. a senior bjp leader said the congress had provided them with an opportunity by raking up the issue of installation of the portrait. ""by doing so, they have ensured that all the organisations in the sangh parivar firmly stand behind us in the forthcoming civic election,"" he said. the leader also said that at the ward level, bjp activists, along with activists from organisations belonging to the sangh parivar, are meeting local corporators and giving them memorandum on the portrait issue. ""this exercise is helping us bring greater co-operation and co-ordination among all the organisations from the parivar at the grass-roots level."" according to sources, last week senior bjp leaders from the state met all the city and district unit office-bearers and elected representatives from western maharashtra to chalk out the strategy for the forthcoming elections to zilla parishads, municipal councils and municipal corporations. the ruling congress party was the first to start its campaign around two months ago with the party's city unit president mohan joshi meeting local corporators, party activists and people in various wards in the city. the party in the city is also organising programmes to bring about interaction between the state and national party observers and other prominent leaders. however, all this seems to have suffered a setback with mr joshi away on long tour to the us. to make matters worse, the key party leader and rajya sabha member suresh kalmadi too is yet to play an active role in the local party activities. the fourth largest group in the pmc, the nationalist congress party, seems to be lagging behind in the process. the only major programme in recent months the party organised was a rally to welcome its state unit president babanrao pachpute, who was on a state-wide tour.

2,BJP demands CBI probe into minister's homestead land,"patna: the settlement of a plot of homestead land in the name of a cabinet minister in the rabri devi government, purnamasi ram, by the state government in 1977 at bagaha in the west champaran district has generated a controversy, as the state bjp demanded cbi probe into the matter on sunday. ram, however, has justified the allotment of the plot to him. the plot meant for landless people should not have been allotted to ram as the latter was not a landless person, bjp has claimed. justifying its demand regarding cbi probe into the matter, the party said the plot allotted to ram was adjacent to the office of the bagaha sub-divisional officer (sdo). bjp chief whip in the state assembly navin kishore prasad sinha on sunday demanded cancellation of the settlement of the plot in ram's name and also his immediate sacking from the cabinet. sinha said the settlement of government plot in a cabinet minister's name had exposed credentials of the ""so-called social justice"" government led by rabri devi. ram, who is the food and civil supply minister, however, said the plot was settled in his name in 1977 when the bagaha sub-divisional office did not even exist. the sdo's office came into existence in 1983, he added. talking to the times news network from bagaha on telephone on sunday evening, ram also maintained that the plot was at least 3,000 feet away from the sdo office. in 1977, the government had settled plots of homestead land in the name of about 1,000 people at that place, he added. beneficiaries included some big landlords, too, ram claimed. ram said he owned five acres of land. asked if it was possible for a person owning five acres of land not to have a plot to construct house, ram said though he had one such plot in his native village naraipur, he could not construct a house on it since he was having a running feud with a big landlord of the village. interestingly, ram said he had left his government job within three months of joining it to take care of his land and agriculture. the state government allots homestead land to landless people, he added.

4,Naidu flays Congress’ opposition to terror law,"hyderabad: telugu desam party president and chief minister n chandrababu strongly criticised the congress for its opposition to the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) issued by the central government recently. the congress is trying to derive political mileage out of the issue without considering the growing terrorism menace in the country, if the resolution passed by the congress working committee (cwc) on the attack of the parliament is any indication, he said. addressing the valedictory session of the sixth batch of trainees for constituency coordination committees at the party headquarters, ntr trust bhavan, here on sunday, naidu said while the entire country was shocked at the heinous crime committed by terrorists in attacking parliament, the cwc while condemning the attack, however, utilised the occasion to criticise the government and reiterate its stand against the passage of poto aimed at checking the growth of extremism in the country. the congress, which lost two of its top leaders — late prime ministers, indira gandhi and rajiv gandhi— in addition to former punjab chief minister beant singh, should in fact be at the forefront of the support for steps to control terrorism. this is not the way to create troubles. take for instance, the sept 11 attack on the us. three months after the attack, nobody criticised the president or the administration. the people, including the past presidents, supported the government in its action against terrorists, he pointed out. the tdp president called upon different political parties to unite and stamp out the menace of terrorism. we should be united in our fight against terrorism irrespective of political affiliations besides securing external assistance to curb terrorism, which has been a major impediment in the development of the country, he said. naidu also criticised the congress for adopting different stands in different states on the issue of reforms. while the congress supports the prevention of organised crime bills passed in states ruled by it, it criticises the same legislation here. the same is the case with their demand for free power which is not provided in any of the congressruled states, he said. naidu told the party cadre to counter the opposition's criticism effectively by taking up the developmental programmes launched by the tdp government for the development of the state.

6,Court says Juvenile Justice Board order violates law,"new delhi: a senior judge recently set aside an order of the juvenile justice board, stating it had violated the juvenile justice act and criminal law. the board on november 15, 2000 had directed a constable to pay rs 25,000 to a boy who was allegedly tortured by him. the judge asked the board to refund the compensation, if paid. satnam singh observed the board had not heard the constable before declaring him guilty of the alleged offence. the judge said the board members had crossed their jurisdiction by imposing a fine of rs 25,000. magistrates can impose fine up to rs 5,000 only. constable krishan kumar had challenged the board's order in july this year. the sessions court had summoned the board's records of the case. in his application, kumar alleged the board had not conducted a fair trial. kumar's advocate r n mittal had contended the case was heard in his client's absence which violates the provisions of the criminal law. according to mittal, kumar was never served a notice. the appeal also claimed that though kumar appeared as a witness in the case, he was never informed that he was an accused. ''no person can be compelled to give evidence against himself,'' mittal had contended. kumar also complained of not getting an opportunity to defend himself. the application has also questioned the time gap between the alleged incident and the board's decision. while the boy was allegedly tortured on september 26, 1998, the complaint was filed before the board two years later. while kumar raised the questions in his appeal, the prosecution failed to submit a reply to all the queries. the incident took place in september 26, 1998, when an 11-year-old boy was handed over to the police by amit jain who had accused him of stealing his mobile. kumar took the boy to a room and tied his hands and legs. the constable allegedly placed a wooden stick between two tables and hung the boy upside down.

8,Hindustan Zinc trims workforce by 1600,"new delhi: state-owned hindustan zinc ltd has trimmed its workforce by nearly 1600 people, representing 16 per cent of the company's total employee strength, following a second round of vrs this year at an estimated cost of rs 108 crore. ""we have been successful in further reducing our workforce by nearly 16 per cent through a separation scheme"", a highly placed company source told pti. the company is learnt to have incurred an expenditure of rs 108 crore on the scheme in which 1370 workmen and 230 officers have opted for retirement. under the scheme, employees are entitled to receive two months' compensation for every year of service rendered or salary for the balance period whichever is lesser. company's zawar group of mines accounted for the highest, nearly 658, workers opting for retirement followed by debari unit with 221 workmen. vizag smelter accounted for 203 workers while figure for agnigundala mines stood at 63. rajpur-dariba mines witnessed the exit of 143 employees. hzl has recently relieved the employees. however, rampur-agucha and chanderiya units were unaffected by scheme. hzl is expected to save rs 45 crore anually on its wage bill as a result of the reduction in workforce. the current vrs follows a previous separation scheme in august which saw the exit of 636 employees as part of efforts to phase out unviable units at sargipalli and maton. as a result the zinc major has seen an over 20 per cent reduction in its workforce from 10,600 odd employees at the begining of the year. the reduction in workforce is expected to add to valuation of company slated for privatisation this fiscal. government will offload 26 per cent stake in the company to a strategic partner along with management control, thereby diluting its stake to 49 per cent. as many as seven bidders are learnt to have evinced interest in picking up stake following the failure of an earlier attempt by sterlite industries to acquire stake.

9,"Cong rules out alliance with SP, BSP","lucknow: upcc president sri prakash jaiswal has made it clear that congress would not enter into an electoral alliance with any party in the forthcoming vidhan sabha elections in up. recent interaction between the leaders of the congress and samajwadi party had sent signals that there could be some pre-poll understanding between the two parties. without mentioning the name of the samajwadi party, jaiswal said here on friday that looking at the rapidly increasing popularity of the congress among the masses in the state, some parties were making false propaganda that there was a possibility of their entering into an alliance with the party. according to some sp leaders, jaiswal's statement meant little since both party chief mulayam singh yadav and general secretary amar singh had already stated in no uncertain terms that there was no question of their party entering into an alliance with the congress for the vidhan sabha elections. bsp is also averse to any such move since the feeling in this party is that if it enters into an alliance with any party, then that party would get the advantage of its (bsp's) transferable votes and bsp would not get any advantage since the votes of other parties are not transferable. the 1991 vidhan sabha elections are quoted as an example by bsp when it had electoral alliance with congress. congress was the only gainer then. regarding selection of candidates the congress is moving cautiously this time. their main emphasis would be on jitau aur tikau candidates. explaining this, jaiswal said that besides considering the winning prospects of a candidate, it would also be ensured that he had full faith in the programmes and policies of the party and would not switch over his loyalty to any other party. he said that the popularity of the prospective candidates in their respective constituencies would also be assessed. the party is trying to adopt a 'fool proof' method to select candidates for the vidhan sabha elections. it has formed nine committees for different divisions. these committees would go to the divisions allotted to them and there they would interview the prospective candidates. they would also contact the party leaders, workers and other prominent citizen in those areas to asses their popularity and winnability. according to jaiswal, the state election committee has taken a vow to give best possible candidates to the people in different constituencies as per their expectations. this committee is expected to complete its job and submit its report to the upcc chief by december 19, after which the state election committee would meet again to finalise the list of the candidates. out of 38 members nominated to these committees, eight are women. party observers feel that keeping in view the factionalism and infighting prevailing in the party, the process of selecting the candidates may not be easy. despite aicc president sonia gandhi's proclamation that the candidates would be selected through democratic means, how far the party would be able to move away from its basic character and established tradition of leaving the final decision on the aicc chief is yet to be seen. many senior aspirants are likely to knock the doors of their godfathers by rushing to delhi, if tickets are denied to them. if they intervene, or if the party chief is given full powers to decide the candidates, then the whole exercise of selecting candidates is expected to prove futile.

10,"'Gujarat to legislate tough law, if POTO is not passed'","baroda: gujarat government will legislate a tough law against organised crimes, in case parliament does not pass the prevention of terrorism ordinance, according to chief minister narendra modi. talking to pti after inaugurating gujarat state electricity corporation limited's 107 mw gas-based power project at dhuvaran, about 70 kms from here on sunday, he charged congress with 'playing politics' by opposing the bill. congress's opposition to poto was ""hypocrisy at its highest level"" as party ruled states of karnataka and maharashtra had tough laws against organised crimes, he added. ""playing with national security for political convenience deserved a political punishment"", modi said. expressing confidence that poto would be passed despite strong opposition from congress and other parties, modi alleged the parties ""were only looking at short term political view instead of a long term realistic view in the larger interest of the nation"". he said all nations were coming up with special legislations to tackle terrorism. the chief ministers of tamil nadu, nagaland, jammu and kashmir and mizoram have supported poto, with some amendments where governments have had to fight terrorism, the chief minister said.

11,Cong to back govt in fighting terror,"new delhi: the congress is expected to adopt a two-pronged approach when union home minister l k advani makes a formal statement on the attacks in parliament on tuesday. assuming that the statement will be followed by a discussion on the issue, the main opposition party will persist with its charge that a ''monumental security lapse'' was responsible for the attacks. at the same time, it will also extend full support to the government to whatever action it plans to take to counter terrorism. congress leaders, who have used the three-day break to gauge public opinion on this episode, feel the people at large believe a serious security lapse had occurred, resulting in the militants gaining easy access to the parliament house precincts. reflecting the public mood for strong action, the congress has said it would support any step the government took to combat terrorism. ""the congress pledges its support to the government in any well-considered step the government might contemplate in countering terrorism,"" congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy said on monday but added that the 'strategic' decision whether to strike at the terrorist camps across the border was of government alone. reddy said since the government had access to all the necessary information and inputs, it was for it to decide on the action to be taken. asked whether camps across the loc should be attacked by india, he said it was a ''strategic decision of the government. but whatever decision government takes, we will support it."" the congress, which had been disrupting parliament over the coffin scam before the december 13 attacks, has had to revise its floor strategy since the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) and terrorism are the dominating issues now. congress president sonia gandhi convened the meeting of senior leaders, including pranab mukhejree, manmohan singh, arjun singh, shivraj patil, n d tiwari and s jaipal reddy, on friday, to discuss its strategy in light of the changed scenario. congress sources said though they had no word from the government about how the business of the house was to be conducted, it was being assumed that a debate on the december 13 episode would follow advani's statement. during the debate, the congress will seek to pin down the nda government on its laxity in the matter, especially since it had prior knowledge about the impending attack. earlier, commenting on us secretary of state colin powell's advice of restraint to india, he said ''we as a sovereign nation will have to take our own decision...naturally, major world powers like the us, russia and the european union will express their views...all these are inputs.'' reddy also accused islamabad of attempting to skirt the issue, stating, ''we are satisfied with the evidence gathered by the police in regard to the involvement of jaish-e-mohammad and lashkar-e-taiba.'' pakistan, he said, should respond to the legitimate request of india by taking action against the two terrorist outfits, adding that ''nobody can deny the nefarious nexus between the two organisations and pakistan agencies.''

12,‘Terror law will be a political weapon’,"kolkata: the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) is not aimed at crushing terrorism as is being projected by the nda government, but is a political weapon to weed out opposition to the globalisation policies of the centre. citu national vice-president and cpm politburo member r. umanath said in kolakta on monday. poto is already in force for the last seven weeks in the form of an ordinance. the centre still could not use it to prevent the attack on parliament. this proves that it is not meant to be used against terrorists at all, umanath said. the veteran trade union leader is in kolkata to address the seventh all-india conference of the indian bank employees' federation. ever since the september 11 attacks in the usa, the prime minister and home minister have been repeatedly saying that a terrorist attack is being planned on parliament. still they could not prevent it, he said. umanath exhorted bank employees to unite and struggle against poto. poto is against all forms of democratic mass movements and civil liberties. bank employees should be at the forefront of the movement against poto, he said. several judges have criticised the provisions of the ordinance. retired chief justice of india j.s. verma has said that there are enough provisions in the existing laws to deal with terrorism. his view has been supported by sitting several supreme court judges, he said. the comparison with similar laws in other countries is not justified, according to umanath. in the uk, the prevention of terrorism act provides for detention without trial for only 48 hours, which can be extended by five more days with the consent of the magistrate. but in poto, this extends to 90 days, he said. the condition of the banking sector was criticised by the delegates. the bank privatisation bill is awaiting enactment. while the common people of the country hold 70 to 75 per cent of the total banking deposits, the government wants to put this money into the hands of private business, state youth services minister mohammed salim said.

13,City govt recruiting few disabled,"new delhi: disabled people are the least sought after candidates for government jobs. this is despite the disability act 1995 which states that three per cent of government jobs should be reserved for them. in an affidavit filed in the delhi high court, the state government has given a list of posts being held by physically disabled employees. the affidavit was submitted in response to the high court's query while hearing a public interest litigation complaining about the government's apathetic attitude to the disabled. of the total number of delhi government posts, 27,040 are sanctioned for the physically disabled. the figure includes state government departments and autonomous bodies. only 299 of the sanctioned posts have been identified as suitable for the handicapped. however, the government has managed to give jobs to only 56. advocate sugreev dubey, who filed the pil on behalf of the delhi students council for the blind, said: ""although the government has sanctioned posts in all its departments it has a category called 'reservation not allowed'. they give the excuse that since there is no reservation in a particular department, it is unable to recruit disabled people there."" the high court bench has, however, directed the social welfare secretary to explain where the government can give a complete three per cent employment to the physically disabled including blind people. the social welfare secretary has been directed to appear before the court on janauary 1, 2002 to submit a detailed affidavit. m k misra, secretary of the delhi government social welfare department, said: ""there is a three per cent reservation in all the departments. it is up to these departments to identify the posts and recruit the disabled."" criticising the delhi government's indifference, disabled activist javed abidi said: ""the sanctioning of posts and identification was done in 1986. the government has not reviewed the same for the last 15 years."" abidi also complained about the government's process for identifying such posts. ""it is highly contentious. so far we have not understood how they do it,"" abidi said. according to him, there is a clause in the act which states that certain institutions can be exempted from employing the disabled. ""but those institutions and posts should include army or pilots for airlines company,"" abidi explained. another facet of the government's apathy is evident from the low employment opportunities which it has given to the physically disabled in the first class categories. among class i officers, the government has identified only 28 posts, while in the group ""c"" and ""d"" categories it has identified 264 posts.
