0,Tipplers raise toast to new excise policy,"KANPUR: Bacchus lovers in the city care two hoots about the recent hike in the rates of

IMFL and country-made liquor.

Unmindful of the increase in price as announced in the new State Excise Policy, Karan, an employee at a MNC here says, â€œI take it as a social lubricant and would continue to do so, who cares for the cost anyway,â€� he scoffs.

City tipplers are, however, happy to note that government would open 10 per cent more liquor outlets besides the already existing 110 beer shops and 50 liquor joints inthe city to make â€˜easyâ€™ the availability of liquor and beer for them.

Deepak Prasad, of Tropica Bar at the Landmark Hotel said, â€œAs far as imported liquor is concerned their sale would not be affected so much as a class of people love these brands and do not switch over their loyalties due to price hike, like, Frascati (an Italian white wine), Blanc De Blanc (French white wine) and sparkling wine - Friexenet (Spanish), which are available between Rs 1,500 to 2,000 per bottle.â€�

Neelam Chaturvedi, a social activist, has welcomed the new excise policy and its decision to not to sell low content alcohol or soft beer at general merchants shops but only at liquor and beer shop.

Earlier, she was fighting tooth and nail to oppose sale of soft beer and fruit beer at

grocery shops, betel shops and departmental shops by conducting street plays, awareness rallies in slums and distributing hand bills.

She even demanded complete ban on liquor in the state. However, people clinking

glasses of Officers Choice brand at the liquor shop of the Mall said increased rates

of liquors would only affect budding boozers while habituals would continue sipping

undeterred. Rohit Bhatia, a liquor shop owner in Krishna Nagar welcomed the move

of the government to renew the licence of old liquor shops.

He rued the decision to increase licence fee from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh.

2,Poll politics cloud illegal migration,"KOLKATA: Reports of a Bangladeshi couple stranded with three children at the no-manâ€™s land late in February were dismissed casually by the media. This was neither new nor as dramatic as the 213 Bangladeshi snakecharmers who had found themselves similarly sandwiched between a section of belligerent BSF jawans on one side and equally hostile jawans of Bangladesh Rifles. But the media did highlight the coupleâ€™s desperate plea for â€˜mercy killingâ€™ after being forced to live in the open for nearly a week, with no access to either food or water.

While both the BSF and the BDR highlighted the case as the handiwork of the other, the couple disappeared into the morning mist , after a week-long standoff in North Dinajpur, as mysteriously as the snake charmers had melted away from Coochbehar districtâ€™s Satgachi border earlier in the month. With the war of words hotting up and with both the BSF and the BDR claiming to have outsmarted the other, the real issue has got buried.

Poor Bangladeshis travelling to India in search of livelihood, influx of persecuted minorities from Bangladesh and movement of both Indian and Bangladeshi smugglers have all been painted with the same brush. They are all described as â€˜infiltratorsâ€™, armed men coming surreptitiously for subversion. Respective national interest has cast a shadow on human rights, comments Ratneswar Bhattacharjee, a scholar on Bangladesh affairs. â€œAll cry for human rights have stopped at the no manâ€™s land.â€�

Observers, however, have found a method in the madness. Elections in both countries, they feel, are responsible for raising the pitch. Till recently, claim these observers, Bangladesh and BDR rarely objected to Bangladeshis being sent back by India. But the Khaleda Zia-Jamat government decided to resist the push backs with an eye on the upazilla polls in Bangladesh, claims a BSF official. Recently held Assembly election in Tripura and upcoming panchayat elections in West Bengal, slated for May this year, might similarly have prompted West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to tacitly toe the line of the NDA government at the Centre.

Although the state BJP ideologue Sabyasachi Bagchi accepts that the national growth rate of Indian Muslims from 9.9 per cent in 1951 to 12 per cent in 2001 is â€˜normalâ€™, he vents his fear of millions of Bangladeshis swamping the Hindus and pave the way for a greater Bangladesh. Uncharacteristically, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has maintained a studied silence on the issue.

His proximity to the deputy prime minister and BJP hardliner, Lal Krishna Advani, embarrasses his colleagues in the Left Front. The frequency with which BJP leaders have ben quoting Bhattacharjee on the â€˜minority issueâ€™ has also made squirm. Bangladeshi diplomats, however, recall that Bhattacharjee had expressed worries the Tripura poll as CPMâ€™s were being killed by tribal insurgents, and also about the separatist â€˜Kamtapurisâ€™ in North Bengal when the Bangladeshâ€™s foreign minister called on him month.

â€¢Bangladeshis travelling to India in search of livelihood, influx of minorities from Bangladesh and movement of Indian and Bangladeshi smugglers have all been painted infiltrators â€“ armed men coming for subversion.

â€¢BJP accepts the national growth rate of Muslims is â€˜normalâ€™, but it vents fear millions of Bangladeshis swamping the Hindus and pave the way for a greater Bangladesh.

3,Debt drives bank guard to suicide,"KOLKATA: A security guard of a bank in central Kolkata committed suicide on Wednesday. Tarak Das, 59, an employee of the Netaji Subhas Road branch of the Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, shot himself with his service rifle during duty hours at the bank in the Hare Street police station area.

Das had come to office as usual at 10 am from Balarambati residence in Hooghly. Around 11.25 am, a sound of gunfire rang out. Startled, the bank staff ran up to the guard room on the mezzanine floor. They pushed open the door to find Das dead in a chair.

He was deeply in debt, said Dasâ€™s colleagues. He had borrowed money from the bank and his colleagues, too. According to DC (central) Zulfiquar Hasan, a suicide note was recovered where Das had listed names of persons from whom he had borrowed money. Das is survived by two sons and a daughter. He was also disturbed about his sons, who were not doing too well in life. Das had been working at the bank for the last 11 years. On February 25, he had applied for withdrawal of PF loan. â€œOn Monday, Das requested me to sanction his loan application as soon as possible in dire need of money,â€� said Sabyasachi Biswas, chief manager of the bank. Had he got the money, Das may not have ended his life, he rued.

Dasâ€™ sons, Biswanath and Gobinda, were totally bewildered by the news of their fatherâ€™s death. â€œI do have not the slightest clue,â€� said Gobinda.

4,"Civic, power depts clash over dues","KOLKATA: The stand-off between the Bidhanannagar municipality and the West Bengal State Electricity Board over tax arrears and electricity dues came to a head on Tuesday evening with the power body connections to several sewerage and water pumping stations in Salt Lake for two hours.

While the municipality claimed that WBSEB owed them Rs 6.6 crore by way of tax arrears and service charges, the power body claimed that Rs 6 crore was due to them in electricity charges.

Municipal chairman Dilip Gupta told TNN that the WBSEB had not paid any tax to the Bidhannagar municipality for services provided. â€œ On the other hand, we paid them Rs 44 lakh on Tuesday and have promised to pay another Rs 75 lakh by March 10,â€� Gupta added.

Apparently the impasse was sorted out late in the evening after Gupta sought the intervention of power minister Mrinal Banerjee. Though the power lines were restored, hostility ran high in both camps. Municipal officials are sore about free civic amenities like water supply, garbage disposal being given to Vidyut Bhavan and other WBSEB installations in the township.

Gupta feels that the simplest solution would be to set off the dues of the two institutions against each other and reach a compromise.

7,J&K govt working on return of Kashmiri pandits,"NEW DELHI: In what could mark the first major step towards return of around three lakh Kashmiri pandits to the valley, the Jammu and Kashmir government is working on a plan to develop an area in Anantnag district for resettling the displaced people.

The government proposes to construct around 500 apartment flats with provision of security and essential facilities in the vicinity of Mattan temple, a pilgrimage centre, in Anantnag for the Pandits to stay there. If the experiment succeeds here, it will be replicated at another prominent pilgrimage centre -- Kheer Bhavani.

Efforts are also being made to persuade the displaced people to return with the government fielding two representatives, Chief Minister''s Principal Secretary Iqbal Khandey and Vijay Bakaya, to hold negotiations.

""Initial talks have been encouraging with many people showing interest in going back. But before that some of them would visit the place to assess the situation,"" state government sources said here.

Raman Mattoo, lone Kashmiri Pandit minister in the Mufti Sayeed-led government, will also pay a visit to the area within a week in this endeavour, they said.

The package would include provision of security to the flats besides facilities like education and health. The accommodation would be free besides which cash relief would continue.

The matter was discussed at a high-level meeting of the government recently.

The Mufti Sayeed-led state government has indicated that the displaced Kashmiri Pandits could be settled temporarily in Mattan and Kheer Bhavani areas by developing these as ""model clusters"" till they can repair their own houses. Besides, the government has identified 166 houses forming 15 clusters in Srinagar and Badgam districts as ""safe"" for return of their displaced Kashmiri Pandits, the sources said.

The list of these clusters has been publicised and steps have been taken to identify the families and find their willingness to return to their homes, they said.

About 50 families registered with the Relief Commission at Jammu were contacted personally to seek their views on return to the valley on the basis of package announced by the government.

The previous Farooq Abdullah government had finalised an Action Plan involving Rs 2,589.73 crore to enable safe and honourable return of the migrants.

The plan, to be implemented in phases, never took off, mainly due to reservations of the community over their safety and security after their return.

The community has been demanding creation of ""conducive atmosphere"" before any step could be taken on the return.

About three lakh Pandits, constituting almost the entire community, moved out of Kashmir valley in late 1989 after militancy erupted there.

8,Khalid met Osama before arrest: Pak officials,"ISLAMABAD: Top al-Qaeda operative Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, captured recently in Pakistan, met Osama Bin Laden weeks before his arrest, proving that the elusive leader of the terror network was alive, officials said.

Following Mohammed''s arrest and his interrogation, Pakistani officials claimed that he had provided them with most solid proof that Bin Laden was alive.

""There is no doubt he is alive and well. We have evidence to show that he is alive,"" the officials were quoted as saying by a media report here.

The officials said they came to the conclusion that bin Laden was alive after indications that Mohammed met him last month. They, however, did not reveal whether the meeting took place in or outside Pakistan.

Media reports earlier said that Bin Laden was believed to be hiding in tribal areas located between the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. However, Pakistani officials said they believed that Bin Laden has certainly moved to a new hideout after Mohammed''s arrest.

""We believe that he has changed his hideout and moved away. He keeps shifting. He surely knows that Khalid Mohammed has been captured and will avoid moving to places he knew about"", they said

It was Mohammed''s arrest that led to the information that some of Bin Laden''s wives and children lived in Iran, the officials said.

Mohammed -- along with his unidentified Arab associate -- has been handed over to the US.

Significantly, Mohammed, who deftly eluded US intelligence agencies since he was spotted in Karachi in September last, was captured after he was betrayed by a colleague, specially to grab the $25-million reward announced for Mohammed''s capture.

""I am not going to tell you how we captured him but Mohammed knows who did him in. He was shocked when he was arrested,"" they said.

Another significant information that has been obtained from Mohammed since his arrest was that Bin Laden''s deputy al-Zawahri slipped out of Pakistan into the Middle East some time back. Al-Zawahri, who is an Egyptian doctor, is not with Bin Laden at present. ""They are not together,"" the officials said.

After being spotted in Karachi, Mohammed fled from there to another Pakistani town of Quetta in Baluchistan. He left Quetta last month after his Egyptian associate Asadullah was arrested by FBI-ISI in a joint raid. Mohammed then moved to Lahore and finally to Rawalpindi.

The officials said Mohammed has not revealed much but most of some of the valuable information came from a computer, CDs and notebook recovered from him.

""The information that has come by virtue of his arrest is immense. It reveals his contacts in the Philippines, Europe and the United States,"" they said.

From the details it was apparent that al-Qaeda operated from a complex e-mail system of cut and paste to prevent the leakage for information, while operating from different internet cafes.

""Even if we manage to pinpoint the cafes, it will be difficult to find the senders,"" the officials said.

9,"No rule of law in UP, sack Mayawati: Oppn","NEW DELHI: The developments in Uttar Pradesh Assembly had its echo in the Lok Sabha on Thursday with the Congress and the Samajwadi Party demanding the dismissal of the Mayawati government on grounds of constitutional breakdown in the state.

Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and Congress Deputy leader Shivraj Patil sought the resignation of Mayawati saying the governor''s address, the state budget and the no-confidence motion against the chief minister were all passed without any discussion in total violation of constitutional norms.

""The chief minister should resign. If she does not, the Centre should impose President''s rule as constitutional machinery in the state has broken down. There is no rule of law and arbitrariness is prevailing,"" they said.

Yadav also demanded a CBI probe into alleged charges of ""brazen"" corruption against Mayawati saying development funds allotted to MPs and MLAs were being ""looted"" on orders of the chief minister.

Countering the Opposition, BJP Chief Whip V K Malhotra said while charges of corruption against Chief Ministers have been there in the past, the Centre had not dismissed them or imposed President''s rule.

""If there is a court case against a chief minister, can the matter be referred to CBI? The Opposition raises what suits them,"" he said.

Earlier, giving his ruling on the issue of tabling of Mayawati''s letter to the Centre, Speaker Manohar Joshi observed that it was ""a sensitive matter"" and agreed with the government that it should not be tabled in the House.

Stating he was treating the matter as closed, Joshi said former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar had yesterday supported the contention of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Deputy L K Advani that in view of the contents of the letter, it would be improper to place it in the House. The Speaker said communications between states and the Centre were confidential in nature and, therefore, the government had the right not to make them public.

Vajpayee and Advani had left it to the Speaker to decide on the issue of tabling the chief minister''s letter.

The Speaker rejected adjournment motions moved by Ramjilal Suman and Akhilesh Singh (both Samajwadi Party) and Sriprakash Jaiswal (Congress) to discuss developments in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Wednesday.

Raising the issue during Question Hour, Yadav said a serious situation had arisen in Uttar Pradesh with the government being run in an unconstitutional manner and sought a discussion on it.

This provoked BJP leader V K Malhotra to raise a point of order ""can anything happening in a state Assembly be discussed in this house.""

Yadav said ""when constitution cannot be protected in the Assembly, it is for this house to do so. The state assembly had passed the budget and no-confidence motion without any discussion and this is a serious matter. The leader of the Opposition was not allowed to speak.""

10,Coca-Cola's voting rights plan still pending with govt,"NEW DELHI: Coca-Cola''s proposal for giving its shareholders differential voting rights after it recently completed divestment of 49 per cent equity in favour of resident Indians is still pending with the government, company sources confirmed on Wednesday.

The soft drinks giant announced completion of divestment on February 27 this year, a day ahead of the deadline set by the government, even as its application is pending with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board against allowing voting rights to Indian shareholders.

""The matter (of not allowing Indian shareholders voting rights) is pending with the government. As per law, differential voting rights is very much a permissible option, and we are waiting for the government to let us know its decision on the issue,"" company sources said but declined to confirm if the shares issued to Indian shareholders are not vested with any voting rights.

The voting rights issue follows Coca-Cola''s repeated pleas to the government to either waive the divestment condition or give it a five-year moratorium.

When government put its foot down and set a deadline of February 28 for completing divestment, the company went ahead with another proposal to restructure its equity, which was permitted.

""The government has itself said that no deviation from the entry level conditions can be allowed. So they should now agree to our request on voting rights,"" sources added.

As per the company''s statement, Hindustan Coca-Cola Holdings has divested 49 per cent stake in its bottling subsidiary Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages in favour of Indian shareholders on private placement basis.

Of the 49 per cent, HCCH has divested 10 per cent in favour of two Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Employee and Welfare Trusts while another six per cent equity has been placed with former and current bottlers and suppliers, the company said in a statement here.

The remaining 33 per cent of the company''s shares have been placed with financial, private and high net worth investors.

HCCB operates a diversified beverage business, owning and operating 26 plants and 60 distribution centres across the country.

In addition to this, the company has 30 contract packers to augment its production capacity besides having a 7,000 strong workforce.

16,VIP cobbler ready for MC polls,"HOSHIARPUR: In the Municipal Committee (MC) election frenzy that promises to reach a feverish pitch as never before, the city has a unique candidate in the fray for Sundayâ€™s

election. Om Prakash Jhakku, a cobbler who has the unique distinction of fighting seven

unsuccessful elections out of which three were for the parliament, three for the Vidhan

Sabha, is now contesting the MC elections for the second time from ward no 6, independently.

While his claim to fame still remains his election against Mayawati when she fought on the BSP ticket from the Hoshiarpur Lok Sabha constituency, Om Prakash remains unfazed even in defeat.

With Mayawati in the dock due to the tapes controversy, Om Prakash takes pride in the fact of having challenged her as an independent candidate. ""I have the record of running the least expensive election campaign,"" he boasts and adds that he fought the last assembly elections on his moped.

Om Prakash, who sits in his little kiosk in the Kotwali Bazaar repairing and polishing

shoes, tells Times News Network that he has fought assembly elections from the party

symbol of the Janta Dal, BSP, and Lok Bhalai Party.

While narrating an incident he states that during terrorism when he was contesting the elections, he was given police security and since he had no place where the security men could sleep, the police used to take him to the police station to spend the night.

With Om Prakash being used to the media and his close association with former Union

minister Ram Vilas Paswan getting him appointments in railway and telecom advisory

committees of the district, he is also known as the VIP cobbler. For Om Prakash fighting an

election is like an addiction as he hopes to make it to the MC this time.

354 in fray A total of 354 candidates are in the fray for the eight Nagar Council elections

in the district. About 1, 64,854 voters would be exercising their voting right to elect MCs from 134 wards in the district.
