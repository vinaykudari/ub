0,‘Transparency in state PSC selections a must’,"LUCKNOW: At the national conference of the chairman of the Public Service Commissions of various states on Thursday, governor Vishnu Kant Shastri said that the primary work of the commission was to select suitable candidates for government jobs.

In his address to the gathering of chairman and members of the PSCs from various states, Shastri asked them to perform their duty impartially. He said that the selection process for the commissions should be transparent. The selection team, he said, should be above reproach.

Shastri said bureaucrats should posses the qualities of firmness and elasticity for the execution of the governmentâ€™s decisions even in adverse situations. He said that the future of the nation would remain secure if the administrative machinery functioned judiciously.

Governor Shastri cautioned the youth against going in for the lucre of quick-money. He said that in choosing a vocation, the youth should not be influenced solely by the pay and perks, but also keep in mind the interest of the nation. A number of speakers dwelt on keeping the selection-process of candidates for the job above reproach.

Chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission Krishna Behari Pandey said that on Friday, participants would discuss the report submitted by a sub-committee for streamlining the selection process and service rules. Chairman of the Union Public Service Surendra Nath said that selection of the right candidates was a challenge before the commission.

3,BJP keen to replace Deshmukh govt in Maharashtra,"NEW DELHI: Battered by successive electoral defeats, and the Congress boasting of ruling 14 states, the BJP leadership is now keen to replace the Vilasrao Deshmukh government, which has been in crisis after the revolt in the NCP.

A senior BJP leader said, â€˜â€˜We are going to face elections in 10 states next year, and in Jammu and Kashmir later this year. For the Congress, the fact that it rules 14 states is a big campaigning point. If we can reduce this to 13, it gives us a talking point. Take Goa, it may be a zilla parishad state, but our victory there counts.â€™â€™

Indeed, BJPâ€™s position on Maharashtra appears to have undergone a seachange. Earlier, it had discouraged the Shiv Sena, its electoral partner in the state, from attempting to destabilise the Vilasrao Deshmukh government. This was because the BJP had felt that if the Deshmukh government lasted its full term, it would be in a better position not just to improve its own electoral position but also to dump the Sena, which it had begun to see as political liability.

But with a plummeting electoral graph, there appears to be an edge of desperation â€” the BJP feels it should seize every opportunity and, therefore, it is putting its weight behind the Sena to help split the Congressâ€™s partner, the NCP.

When the partyâ€™s officebearers meet here on Friday and Saturday, the Maharashtra scenario will be discussed along with the impending assembly elections.

Commenting on the NCP sending its MLAs to Indore till the date of voting, Union parliamentary affairs Pramod Mahajan said, â€˜â€˜ For the first time in Indian political history, a ruling party is sending its MLAs outside the state. In the past, it is the opposition which has done so.

4,Delayed flyovers cost govt Rs 50 cr,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state public works department (PWD) has incurred a loss of Rs 50 crore due to the delay in commissioning five flyovers in the city. Each of these five flyovers, being built by the PWD, are running one-year behind schedule.

The PWD had allocated about Rs 180 crore for flyovers at South Extension, Punjabi Bagh, Mayapuri, Dhaula Kuan and Safdarjung Hospital. With the delay in commissioning these flyovers, the project cost has escalated by about 20 per cent since last year. The five flyovers now cost about Rs 230 crore.

Delhi state PWD minister A K Walia said cost escalation has strained the exchequer. â€˜â€˜The construction cost of each flyover has gone up by about 20 per cent in the last one year,â€™â€™ he said.

Walia said the South Extension flyover would be opened on July 31. This flyover was supposed to have been completed 15 months back, he conceded.

Being built at a cost of Rs 45 crore, 80 per cent work has been completed. The PWD has commissioned Afcons, a private firm to construct this flyover.

While the flyover is likely to be commissioned by July-end, work on the traffic underpass and subway would be completed by only by September.

Walia said the three-level Punjabi Bagh flyover, which is running one-year behind schedule, is likely to be completed by October-end. Between the flyover and the underpass, there would be a pedestrian plaza on the second level.

The PWD has outsourced work to Afcons and is spending about Rs 72 crore on the project. Walia said the underpass would be ready by August while the flyover and pedestrian plaza would be commissioned by October this year.

The Mayapuri flyover is likely to be opened for traffic by November-end. The deadline for this project was November 2001. The PWD has allocated Rs 25 crore to Afcons to construct this flyover.

5,Aided schools warn of bandh,"PUNE: Over 17,000 aided high schools in the state will observe a one- day bandh on the day schools re-open for the new academic year, if the state government fails to take a concrete decision on the payment of non-salary grant, pending since 1998. It may be recalled that the Maharashtra State Federation of Educational Institutions (MSFEI) had warned of the impending agitation, saying that many schools did not even have money to buy educational material like dusters and chalks. The non-salary grant is used to pay telephone and electricity bills, building rents, repairs and laboratory material. P.B. Kulkarni, general secretary of the MSFEI, said that representatives of all educational institutions met on Tuesday and called upon the government to hold a meeting with the federation president and veteran freedom fighter Govindbhai Shroff at the earliest. If the meeting with state minister for education did not materialise immediately, the schools will observe a one-day bandh, Kulkarni warned. As part of the agitation, office-bearers of educational institutions, parents, head masters, teaching and non-teaching staff will stage a dharna in front of the offices of the education director, deputy director and education officers on the day schools re-open. Kulkarni clarified that since all schools re-open on different dates, the dharna and bandh will be observed by schools on the respective re-opening day. Memoranda will be submitted to the education officers concerned. While the annual payment of non-salary grant works out to Rs 250 crore, the state government had been releasing only Rs 30 to Rs 40 crore every year. As a result, the dues mounted to over a crore in some cases. Currently, there are over 2 crore school students and educational institutions have warned that they will have to close down schools if the money was not released.

6,Experts differ on applicability of defection law,"MUMBAI: Legal circles are divded on whether the anti-defection law can be applied to the four Nationalist Congress Party legislators who have withdrawn support to the Democratic Front.

Some constitutional experts say that the MLAs withdrawal of support effectively amounts to quitting the NCP.

Senior counsel P.R. Vakil said, â€œBy withdrawing their support to the DF government of which the NCP is a part, the MLAs concerned are virtually withdrawing their allegiance to their own party. And since their number is less than one third of the total NCP strength in the assembly, they are liable to be unseated under the anti-defection law.â€™â€™

If more than one-third of MLAs quit the party, the move is regarded as a split not defection.

The tenth schedule of the Constitution, which deals with provisions for disqualification of membership on the grounds of defection, says that if party members voluntarily relinquish their membership, then they can be disqualified. The speakerâ€™s decision on the matter is final.

State advocate general Goolam Vahanvati said, â€œThe supreme court has held that voluntary relinquishment of membership of a party is not restricted to the mere act of quitting the organisation. It can extend to the withdrawal of support by an MLA to the government. But this is a matter for the Speaker to decide after complying with principles of natural justice.â€™â€™

The four NCP members have been issued show cause notices to explain why they cannot be disqualified. Article 191(2) of the Constitution deals with disqualification for membership of the House. Mr Vakil said before the anti-defection law was framed, MLAs could simply cross the floor of the house to join another party.

However, other legal experts said that the four NCP members wonâ€™t attract the anti-defection law. Adhik Shirodkar, legal expert and former Shiv Sena member of the Rajya Sabha, said the NCP members have not defected. â€œDefection means you join another party without the requisite number, which is one-third of members of a legislature partyâ€™â€™ he said.

He noted that the NCP members have not even left their party. â€œThey have only withdrawn support to the DF coalition.â€™â€™

He said,â€�No MLA would commit political hara-kiri by asking to be disqualified under the anti-defection law as then they would be unable to contest an election for as long as six years.â€™â€™

He said the four NCP members cannot be stripped of the membership of the legislative assembly and nor can disciplinary action be taken against them as they had not defied any party whip.

He said, â€œThis is the first time, to the best of my knowledge that such situation has arisen here. It will require lot of legal hair-splitting.â€™â€™ Senior advocate Ram Rao Adik of the Congress concurred with Mr Shirodkar.

He said, â€œA speaker has control only over developments that take place in the house.â€™â€™ He said that there is a whip issued by the political party and if members flout it, the speaker can issue a notice to them and after hearing them give his decision.

â€œIf members of a party, even they constitute less than one third its total strength, withdraw support to the party outside the house, the party can expel them from the party but this does not attract the anti-defection law and these members cannot lose their seats,â€™â€™ he contended.

7,Aided schools may hold one-day bandh,"PUNE: Over 17,000 aided high schools in the state will observe a one-day bandh on the day schools re-open for the new academic year, if the state government fails to take a concrete decision on the payment of the non-salary grant, pending since 1998.

The Maharashtra State Federation of Educational Institutions (MSFEI) has been pressing for the grant saying schools did not even have the funds to buy dusters and chalks. The non-salary grant is used to pay telephone and electricity bills, building rents, repairs and laboratory material.

8,Environmentalists call for steps to increase tree cover,"MUMBAI: Noting that Mumbai has only five lakh trees for a human population of 12 million, environmentalists have called for urgent measures to increase tree cover.

With population growth and urbanisation, more of forest and agricultural land will be lost. This makes afforestation in urban areas vital, said S.B. Chaphekar, former professor of Pune University, in Mumbai on Wednesday. He was speaking at the â€˜World Environment Dayâ€™ function jointly organised by Society for Clean Environment, National Society for Friends of Trees and Institute of Science.

People have paid only lip service to the cause of environment, he said. â€œTrees are planted ceremoniously every year but are not taken care of. Once they are planted, they become orphans for life,â€™â€™ Mr Chapekar said. Laws stipulating that cooperative societies must plant trees before they are granted an occupancy certificate remain unimplemented, he complained.

Prof Shyam Asolekar of Indian Institute of Technology said that one of the achievements of environmental activism was that sustainability is now accepted as one of the markers of a projectâ€™s success.

The incorporation of public opinion in policy making and the introduction of public hearings in environmental projects has also been possible due to environmental activism, he said.

The activism has resulted new laws and regulatory frameworks being formulated.

The â€˜polluter will payâ€™ principle is now widely accepted by all, Prof Asolikar said. In some of the states in the U.S., industries that draw river water are asked to contribute treated water back to the source. Such a system was tried out in Karnataka, but wasnâ€™t successful.

Yet, despite some gains, speakers at the gathering were circumspect while measuring achievements. â€œIn 30 long years,we could not stop soil degradation. What has gone wrong?â€™â€™ asked Dr Chaphekar. Citing grim statistics of poverty, soil degradation and water shortage, T.R. Saranthan of SOCLEEN said, â€œin spite of considerable efforts, many of the problems plaguing the earth have not been solved.

G.D.Kelkar, chairman of Kelkar-Vaze Educational Trust, spoke on the potential for growth of medicinal plants in Maharashtra.

The government should promote the cultivation of medicinal plants and researchers, farmers and industry should collaborate in this field, he said.

9,Stage set for election of local body chiefs,"PATNA: While hearing the LPA filed by the State Election Commission, the Patna High Court on Thursday stayed the operation of its May 25 order relating to the reservation of the posts of chairpersons of the nagar parishads and nagar panchayats for women. With the courtâ€™s fresh order, the stage is now set for reservation of the posts of chairpersons of the local bodies for women. â€œThe implication of the stay order is that the two notifications â€” nos. 20 and 21 dated May 15, 2002 â€” issued by the commission reserving certain posts of chairpersons of the nagar parishads and nagar panchayats for scheduled castes, scheduled castes (women) and women shall remain valid and operative,â€� said a press release issued by the commission, adding that the case has been admitted for further hearing. The commission has sent a letter to all the district magistrates concerned asking them to complete the process of election of chairpersons and deputy chairpersons of the nagar parishads and nagar panchayats in their respective districts before June 17. The commission has also asked them to issue the notification for holding the meeting of newly elected members of the local bodies on June 8 for election of their chairpersons and deputy chairpersons. Earlier, the commission had reserved 35 posts of nagar panchayat chairpersons â€” eight for scheduled castes, four for scheduled castes (women) and 23 for women. Similarly, it had reserved 14 posts of nagar parishad chairpersons â€” three for scheduled castes, two for scheduled castes (women) and nine for women. However, the notifications issued by the commission in this regard were challenged through three writ petitions in the Patna High Court. The court on May 24 quashed those parts of the two notifications which related to the reservation of the posts of chairpersons for women. Later, the commission filed an LPA in the high court against the order passed by it on May 24.

12,India rules out US-UK border vigil,"NEW DELHI: India has ruled out patrolling by a US-UK monitoring force along the Line of Control, saying it was not practical.

A bilateral mechanism was the only way to a solution, the ministry of external affairs said on Friday. ""The issue was not discussed between External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and visiting US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage,'''' the ministry spokesperson said.

However, Armitage later said: ""I discussed the issue of joint patrolling by Indo-Pak troops with both Musharraf and Vajpayee. The modalities of monitoring the LoC still have to be worked out and no decision has been taken."" Armitage, who is on a peace mission to India and Pakistan, had wide-ranging discussions with Singh on Friday morning and later met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the evening. Armitage met Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on Thursday. India also ruled out immediate joint patrolling by Indian and Pakistan troops, a proposal mooted by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in Almaty recently. ""No formal request will be made to Pakistan until there is evidence of concrete action on the ground to control infiltration and cross-border terrorism,"" the spokesperson said. ""Pakistan is perfectly capable of checking infiltration if it really wants to and a dialogue can be started only if there is concrete action on the ground,'''' she added.

13,DF govt to face confidence vote on June 13,"MUMBAI: The beleaguered Democratic Front (DF) government in Maharashtra on Friday decided to face the confidence motion on June 13 in the state Assembly even as three NCP MLAs challenged in the Mumbai High Court show cause notices served on them by the Speaker for withdrawing support to the ruling coalition.

Hectic political manoeuvering continued with NCP MLA Shalinitai Patil demanding DF government''s resignation.

RPI (Gavai) member and Minister of State Sulekha Kumbhare claimed that she was offerred ""incentives, including Cabinet berth"" for switching loyalties by the Opposition Shiv Sena-BJP camp.

In keeping with the HC directive, the aggrieved MLAs, who were issued show cause notices, met the Speaker Arun Gujarathi to seek time for filing their replies. The Speaker granted them time until June 11.

Emphasising that DF government will sail through the confidence motion, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said in case it loses in the show of strength, the saffron combine would not be in a position to form the next government forcing fresh elections in the state.

Leader of Opposition in state Assembly Narayan Rane and BJP national Vice-President Gopinath Munde claimed that they had support of 152 MLAs in the lower House and discounted reports that Congress MLA Padmakar Walvi had been forcefully confined at a suburban club.

A relaxed-looking Walvi, who has switched loyalties to Sena-BJP camp, told reporters that he had been staying at the club on his own free will.

AICC general secretary and in-charge of party affairs in Maharashtra Vayalar Ravi told reporters that Deshmukh enjoyed full confidence and support of the party high command and scotched reports that Congress leadership had advised the chief minister to put in his papers if he was not confident of mustering majority support.

The chief minister admitted that by losing the support of the Left Front combine, the DF coalition''s secular image had sustained a dent, which needed to be rectified by wooing them back into the government-fold.

Deshmukh said they were trying to convince the estranged Left Front that by severing ties with them they could be jumping into the fire from the fire pan. ""We might be bad but the alternative could be worse,"" he cautioned the Left Front.

RPI''s Kumbhare fired a salvo at the saffron siblings alleging that they had stooped down to offering her a cabinet berth and victory in the next election if she agreed to change colours.

The Sena-BJP camp denied the allegation with Munde sarcastically remarking, ""I don''t have any more Cabinet berths to offer.""

Decrying the ""lewd"" manner in which MLAs were being lured, the chief minister lamented that the Opposition was painting a grim picture that MLAs were up for ""sale"".

Munde said in the event of Sena-BJP combine coming to power, the chief minister''s post will go to Sena, which has 69 members in the lower House compared to 56 of BJP.

Rane, however, told reporters that Sena supremo Bal Thackeray will decide the party''s chief ministerial nominee.

Meanwhile, three NCP MLAs told the HC that the Speaker had not given them enough time to file replies to show cause notices.

Although, the rules specify seven days time, only two days was given to them to file replies.

The court adjourned the matter till June 10 to enable the MLAs to approach the Speaker for extension of time.

In a related development, the Speaker allowed Shivajirao Naik, Narayan Pawar, Narsingh Patil, Vinay Kore (all NCP) and Gangaram Thakerward (JD-S) to file in their replies to show cause notices by June 11.

As the political scenario hotted up, the MLAs of the saffron combine streamed into the metropolis on Friday following directive by their respective party high commands to remain present till the confidence motion was taken up on June 13.

Away from the hectic political acitivities, the NCP and Congress MLAs were in ""safe"" haven at Indore and Bangalore respectively.

The petition was filed under Section 80 of the Representation of People''s Act, by B.N. Krishnamurthy of Nagarbhavi, a voter of Uttarahalli Assembly constituency.

15,Gang of forcible harvesters busted,"CHANDIGARH: Crime in rural areas of Punjab seems to be taking a new turn. After murders and robberies, now gangs of â€œforcible harvestersâ€� have started appearing on the scene. What is more interesting is that they used weapons once used by militants in the state.

The Kapurthala police busted one such gang which used to harvest crops at gunpoint using weapons like AK-56 assault rifles.

SSP RN Dhoke, in a statement on Friday said three persons from Amritsar district, Bawa Singh, Charanjit Singh and Dayal Singh, had been operating in Sultanpur Lodhi and coercing farmers to part with their wheat crop.

The SSP said the kingpin of the gang, Bawa Singh, is a hardcore criminal involved in about 26 cases of violence and murder, mostly in Tarn Taran area in Amritsar district.

He did not rule the possibility of the gang having militant links since its members used weapons like the AK-56 rifle and SLRs.

One AK-56 rifle with 52 rounds and two guns were recovered from the gang.

Dhoke said it was yet to be ascertained how he had procured the AK-56 rifle, once used by militants in the state. The police started looking for the gang after it was involved in a fiery altercation with one Tara Singh in the Sultanpur Lodhi area whose crop Bawa Singh and others had tried to harvest forcibly in April.

When Tara Singh resisted, the gang fired, injuring one person seriously.

16,Militant outfits’ revival cannot be ruled out: DGP,"AMRITSAR: Not ruling out the possibility of terrorist organisations of 80s becoming active and establishing links with Kashmiri militant outfits, MS Bhullar, Punjab director general police (DGP), told mediapersons that these groups in Punjab were not strong enough to create any terror in the state.

However, police was keeping a vigil on the nexus of militants.

Talking about the bomb explosion that had rocked the state in recent past, Bhullar said that these were militant acts through which they just wanted to make their presence felt by creating terror in the state. But they would not go on a killing spree or cause much damage, he added.

He said Pathankot was the most vulnerable point for the entry of Kashmiri militant outfits and police was doing round the clock patrol to check their entry in the state.

Inspector general of police Rajan Gupta said that many terrorists had in past made trips to their hideouts. Asked whether they had raided their hideouts, Gupta said, â€œTheir job is to establish hideouts and ours is to trace them.â€� They continuously receive intelligence input from various agencies and conduct patrolling and chalk out strategy accordingly, he added.

About the ongoing border tension, Bhullar claimed that police was working in coordination with Army and Border Security Force to provide any help to civilians in case of any eventuality.

He said that in May 2002 police had recovered a huge quantity of drugs during a special campaign that was launched in the eight districts of border zone.

17,Shalinitai asks DF govt to step down,"MUMBAI: The Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party on Friday took another blow when one of its senior functionaries, MLA Shalinitai Patil, exhorted the ruling Democratic Front government to resign â€œwith decencyâ€™â€™.

The NCP is a key ally in the Congress-led DF government.

Ms Patil, a political heavyweight from western Maharashtra, said in a statement that the Vilasrao Deshmukh ministry should lay down office as it had failed to sustain the development of the state.

Reiterating her loyalty to the NCP, however, she launched a veiled attack on party bigwigs for ignoring senior members. She suggested that NCP chief Sharad Pawar should allow party legislators to vote according to their conscience during the trial of strength in the legislative assembly on June 13.

Meanwhile, Matoshree health club at Jogeshwari, where several rebel DF MLAs have been lodged by the Sena-BJP combine in the run-up to the trial of strength in the assembly, witnessed more drama on Thursday night as Congress MLA Padmakar Valvi seemed to attempt to escape in an autorickshaw.

But the Congress legislator, who has withdrawn support to the DF government,was halted by a squad of Sena activists. They reportedly beat up the autorickshaw driver.

Minister of state for home Kripa Shankar Singh accused the Sena of having coerced Mr Valvi into staying in the club. However, Mr Valvi denied the incident and said that he was â€œabsolutely fineâ€™â€™ there. Sena MLA and whip of the partyâ€™s legislative wing Gajanan Kirtikar said, â€œMr Valvi had stepped out of the club premises for a stroll.This led to some misunderstanding. But Mr Valvi is very much with us.â€™â€™

Maharashtra legislative assembly speaker Arunlal Gujarathi will hear a petition seeking the disqualification of five MLAs on June 11. Mr Gujarathi announced this after he held talks with the MLAs at his Vidhan Bhavan office. â€œThe legislators sought some more time to submit their explanations.

So, I have posted the hearing on June 11,â€™â€™ Mr Gujarathi said.
