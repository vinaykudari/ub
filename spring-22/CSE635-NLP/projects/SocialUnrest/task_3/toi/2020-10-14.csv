0,Banks prefer heist pinch,"KOLKATA: It is the bizarre circle of policies and priorities of banks and insurance companies that continues to play havoc with the security of banks. The robbers couldnâ€™t have asked for a better deal.

Bank money is insured. So, security is of the least priority to bank authorities, obsessed with cost-cutting exercises to beat competition. Whatâ€™s worse, insurance companies bargain for bigger premiums with banks that have the worst of security systems. â€œWho cares for security,â€� DC (detective department) Soumen Mitra said, when asked about the repeated bank robberies.

It seems the robberies at Punjab and Sind Bank Bhowanipore) and Punjab National Bank (Gariahat Road) taught no lessons. Neither branch has security guards though they are located on one of the most busiest streets of the city. Robbers had a cakewalk when they struck the two banks this year, netting nearly Rs 19 lakh in all.

â€œBankers indemnity â€” the bank money insurance scheme â€” covers hold-ups and robbery in transit. The security arrangement of each bank is mentioned during declaration. In all probability, these branches might have categorised themselves as branches without security personnel,â€� a senior officer of New India Assurance said. After the twin heists, the police had tried their best to get banks to realise the importance of security but to no avail. In May this year, officers heading five city police divisions and the detective department met officials of leading nationalised, private and foreign banks.

â€œWe underlined some basics of bank security,â€� Mitra said. â€œBut we were taken aback by the banksâ€™ lackadaisical attitude to security. The head cashier at PSB left his chamber open and unattended. The PNB has a 161-page internal security manual, listing steps to be followed in case of a robbery. Unfortunately, none of the measures are followed,â€� an officer added. Banks seem to consider armed guards or upgrading the security gadgets a wasteful expenditure. With the cushion of insurance, it is felt that a robbery would not directly affect the bank.

1,Left outfits keep rally fire burning,"KOLKATA: The CPM labour arm called off its procession to the Left Front trade unionsâ€™ protest meeting following the interim stay on restrictions on rallies on Tuesday. However, the RSP workersâ€™ wing refused to fall in line.

Its members marched to Shahid Minar on Tuesday to attend the meeting. SUCI activists, too, went in a procession to Rani Rashmani Avenue. Womenâ€™s organisations backed by the Left Front will go ahead with their protest meeting on Wednesday, sans the processions. Front leaders wonâ€™t allow the mood to die down in view of the interim nature of the stay.

Throughout October and November, they plan to mobilise public opinion against the â€œattack on democracy and rightsâ€� â€” targeting the Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s Ayodhya campaign as well as the judicial strictures. Aware of the growing public apathy towards rallies, the Left Front is gradually coming to terms with the spirit of the order.

â€œWe want both processions and cars to move on the city roads, one making way for the other,â€� the oncedefiant LF chairman Biman Bose said, parroting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. But the CPM mandarins at Alimuddin Street wouldnâ€™t divulge their proposals on â€œreasonable restrictionsâ€� on rallies and meetings. â€œLet other political parties float their proposals.

We need to take a look at them before we make our own suggestions,â€� said state CPM secretary Anil Biswas who had been harping on this point from day one. Biswas is also eyeing the outcome of the continuing all party debates in the city, the recent being organised by the chambers of commerce. Party leaders hinted that the CPM would wait for a public consensus on possible restrictions on rallies and meetings and float its suggestions by mid November based on which the state may table a Bill in the winter session of the Assembly starting from November 28.

3,Govt throws milling rules to the winds,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab government has made nonsense of its rice milling policy for the year 2003-04, which was announced with much fanfare recently and was touted to be a step to curb corrupt practices of rice millers and officials of various food grain procurement agencies.

Now under an amendment the very doors of corruption the government wanted to close have been opened under the garb of ""curbing"" corruption in the procurement and processing system.

The milling policy for 2003-04 had defined who was to be considered a defaulter.

Under Section 6 (h) of the policy the department of food and civil supplies had delineated the parameters which would disqualify a miller from being allotted paddy for custom milling.

What did the government do? The very day that official procurement began, October 1, the department issued a letter to all state procurement agencies ""redefining"" the expression defaulter.

Of the seven parameters only one, registration of a police case/court case against a miller, now constitutes a default.

What does this mean in practical terms? Before the ""redefining"" if a miller had been allotted paddy for custom milling and he did not deliver it back to the government, he was considered a defaulter.

Now even if officers are aware that a particular mill/miller has defaulted there is nothing that stops them from giving more government paddy for milling.

Another fraudulent practice was associated with leasing of shellers.

The owners would hand over the sheller to the leasee who in turn would undertake custom milling work for the state government.

In many instances the leasee would not deliver rice to the government and would sell the paddy/rice in the open market.

This was banned under the 2003-04 policy but is possible once again after the amendment.

This mode of defalcation is a major source of corruption and will continue unchecked. current financial year.

Under the old policy shifting of paddy stocks was permitted within a district only if there was a surplus and there was no milling capacity in the vicinity of the centre.

But in many cases in Ludhiana district, this norm is being violated and the transportation is being done at official cost.

Director, food and civil supplies, P S Aujla was not available for comments.

4,ST employees file contempt petition against govt,"PUNE: The Maharashtra State Transport Kamgar Sanghatana has filed a contempt petition against the state government for not im-plementing the high courtâ€™s order asking the government to take action against illegal passenger transport.

Addressing a news conference here on Tuesday, Hanumant Tate, general secretary of the ST Kamgar Sanghatana said that the ST was suffering revenue loss of Rs 300 crore because of the illegal pas-senger transport by private bus operators. â€œThe Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court on January 8, 2002 ordered the state gov-ernment to take action against illegal passenger transport. However after four months the drive against illegal passenger transport stoppedâ€�, he observed.

The contempt petition was filed before the Aurangabad bench of the high court on Monday in which the government, state transport secretary and transport commissioners have been made party.

Tate revealed that during the four months when transport authori-ties took action against private operators, STâ€™s revenue recorded an increase of Rs 67 crore. The government also earned additional Rs 12 crore as passenger tax during the period. Besides filing a con-tempt petition, the ST Kamgar Sanghatana staged demonstrations at all district places to demand strict implementation of the high court order.

Tate said that the workersâ€™ union also wanted strict enforcement of the no parking zone outside ST stands to prevent private bus opera-tors from picking up passengers, action against private bus opera-tors who violate their permit conditions and acted as stage carriers and did not follow rules about seating capacity.

Speaking about other demands of the union, he said that the sales tax on diesel be reduced from 40 per cent to 22 per cent which will annually save Rs 113 crore of ST. The passenger tax needed to be brought down from 17.5 per cent to 10 per cent to bring it to the level of other states which will save another Rs 145 crore. Tate suggested that if passenger tax was levied on the ticket sale it could save an-other Rs 40 crore. He observed that these measures would help ST in a big way.

Tate pointed out that ST employees through the ST Workers Co-operative Bank will be shortly donating 20 new buses to the corpo-ration. â€œWe have been going out of way to save ST and have put aside out personal demands like bonus and wage revision. We want to provide better service to passengersâ€�, he remarked.

He added that recruitment has been banned since 1988 and the ST badly needed around 11,500 drivers, cleaners and conductors. The union also wanted the government to abolish junior pay scale of-fered to 14,000 drivers as they had same educational qualification as other drivers, were putting in equal work hours and hence deserved equal pay, he said.

Tate said that the union was opposed to hiring private buses to augment STâ€™s fleet, handing over STâ€™s parcel service to private con-tractors and gradual privatisation of the MSRTC.

5,"Kings in IT, laggards in cyber law","HYDERABAD: Despite the state making steady progress in the field of Information Technology, lawmen are lagging behind in their pursuit of cyber crooks.

The authorities are yet to set up a Cyber Appellate Tribunal, as required under the Information Technology Act, 2000, to look into cyber crimes.

""There is no urgency because very few cases have been registered under cyber laws,"" says special secretary (IT) Ajay Sawhney.

In fact, the number is a mere 11 cases.

Of them, charge sheets have been filed in only two â€” the rest of the cases being stuck in various stages of investigation.

Cyber law experts explain that few cases are being registered under the IT Act because advocates, police officials and even judges are not aware of the provisions of cyber laws.

""In fact, most complainants insist that their case be registered under the Indian Penal Code,"" said V C Vivekanandan, cyber law professor at Nalsar University of Law.

This is because they have doubt if they will be able to win the case if it is tried under cyber laws.

""The government rushed through the IT Act in 2000 because industry circles felt the need for a legal framework to deal with grievances pertaining to business deals done over the Internet, especially with the outsourcing sector,"" said Vivekanandan.

The very purpose of the law is defeated as the central government and the respective state governments are yet to put in place the legal bodies as required by the law.

Experts say the number of cases filed under cyber law will increase once the complainant is confident that officials are well versed in the nuances of the law.

6,"No place for violence, says Vinay Katiyar","LUCKNOW: Denouncing violence threat by the VHP, BJP state president Vinay Katiyar said that there was no place for violence in the Ram Janambhoomi movement.

Without taking name of VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia, Katiyar launched a counter-offensive saying that â€œthose who were talking of violence have no knowledge and background of the Ram Janambhoomi movement.â€� Katiyar said that Ram Bhakts had always resorted to non-violent means to keep their movement going for centuries and there was no question of them taking to violent means now.

â€œWe have always fought and kept the movement alive with â€˜ahimsaâ€™. There is no place for â€˜hinsaâ€™ (violence) in the Ram Janambhoomi movement,â€� pointed out Katiyar, who had led kar sevaks on November 2, 1990 when the police had opened fire on them at Hanumangarhi in which several of them had died.

When his attention was drawn towards Togadiaâ€™s statement and attack on the prime minister, the BJP state chief said that he was not taking anyoneâ€™s name but was only denouncing those who were misguiding Ram Bhakts by exhorting them to resort to violent means.

Appealing to the Mulayam government to allow Ram Bhakts reach Ayodhya and participate in October 17 programme, Katiyar said that the government was unnecessarily vitiating the communal atmosphere by restricting their entry to the temple town. â€œThe court has only directed the government to maintain status quo at the disputed site. The government should fortify the RJB complex instead of putting hurdles and disallowing the VHP programme which is being held far from the disputed area,â€� he pointed out. â€œBy putting hurdles and banning entry of Ram Bhakts, the Mulayam government was helping the VHP and the BJP to keep the Ram temple issue alive,â€� he quipped.

Meanwhile, Katiyar has been authorised by the party election committee to shortlist names of candidates for two assembly by-poll seats in the state after holding a meeting on Wednesday evening. The names will be sent to the Central Election Committee shortly for approval.

8,VHP's rally violates ASI order,"NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad violated the Allahabad High Court orders right at the beginning of its Ayodhya march, by not referring to the Archeological Survey of India''s report.

""[Khudai ke sabut ke baad bhi mandir ke virodh kyon]"" read a few of the VHP banners, as the procession was flagged off at Ramlila Maidan by VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia and other VHP leaders on Wednesday afternoon. The crowd of a few thousand was remarkably small and all of them went to a march around the Old Delhi area and would return to Ramlila Maidan except Togadia.

Interestingly, Togadia who appeared to be wearing a bullet proof vest underneath his white jacket, did not join the rest of the VHP leaders on an open truck that led the procession.

The Court had ordered that ""It is further expected of every responsible persons including leaders -- religious and non-religious -- not to issue any statement pertaining to the ASI report or interpret or twist it to suit his interest, particularly, when the matter is sub-judice and the court is yet to decide as to whether the ASI report is to be confirmed or rejected or how it is to dealt with"".

The VHP rally began with various VHP leaders referring to the digging of the disputed site by the AIS and the ""evidence"" obtained therein.

Former BJP MP B L Sharma Prem, Vidyanand Maharaj and Rameshwar Das were few of the leaders, who directly referred to the ASI''s findings, whereas the VHP President Vishnu Hari Dalmia hinted about it that now after the recent evidence, the Muslims ought not claim the site because it is against the Muslim religion.

9,'My arrest will serve VHP purpose',"NEW DELHI: Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore has said that his arrest in Lucknow will only serve the parishad''s purpose. And that the sankalp sammelan will go on without him.

Being held at a VIP guest house in Daalibagh, Lucknow, Kishore told Times News Network on telephone after his arrest: ""Hum to jail mein hain. But this will not affect the VHP''s convention in Ayodhya. The people who should be there are already there and the programme will go on.""

VHP chief Ashok Singhal, he said, was already in Ayodhya and at least two lakh people were expected to gather in the temple town for Friday''s convention despite the mass detention of Ram bhakts all over.

""The arrest will only serve the purpose of the VHP and highlight it''s cause further,"" he said. Kishore added he had been told he would remain under arrest till October 17, the day of the VHP''s sankalp sammelan to reiterate the reolve to build aRam temple in Ayodhya.

Two local VHP leaders were being held along him at the guest house, while about 3,000 supporters arrested after a rally had been sent to police lines.

Over 1,88,000 people had already been arrested, Kishore said, VHP leader Pravin Togadia was yet to embark on his journey towards Ayodhya leading supporters gathered in Delhi for a rally on Wednesday. The Mulayam Singh Yadav administration has banned the entry of the three top leaders of the VHP - Singhal, Kishore and Togadia - into Ayodhya. It has also been making preventive arrests.

Kishore, who had earlier said that he expected UP chief minister Mulayam singh Yadav to help the temple cause, pointed out that Yadav was ""keeping a very low profile. He is not uttering a wordand only working through his aides"".

He did not expect a replay of 1990''s bloody October when the UP authorities, under orders from Mulayam Singh who was CM then too, had opened fire on Ram sevaks killing many. This time, Kishore said, he believed Yadav would not use blatant force.

But the senior VHP leader continues to be more cut-up with the BJP-led Central government. ""They have not done anything to help. Not even restored the diverted trains as promised."" To him, he said, the Mulayam Singh Yadav UP government and the BJP government at the Centre were all the same.

Kishore was arrested at about noon on Wednesday from the Shishu Mandir ground in Nirala Nagar, where about a thousand VHP supporters had gathered as the parishad began it''s final leg in the build-up to Friday''s Ayodhya Sankalp Sammelan. Rallies were held in Lucknow and Delhi before leaving for Ayodhya.

10,"Don't mess with the govt, Naik tells IOC","NEW DELHI: Petroleum Minister Ram Naik on Wednesday advised employees of the Indian Oil Corporation against going in for a confrontation with the government over the proposal to sell part of its retail network.

""Members of the officers association met me to express their apprehensions against the proposal. I assured them that these factors will be taken up at an appropriate forum in the government. There is need for patience as the Cabinet has given three months'' time to find a way out of the oil sector sell off logjam,"" Naik said after announcing the second round of bidding for tapping gas trapped in coalmines.

At their meeting with Naik, the Indian Oil Officers Association officials told the minister that they would go on an indefinite strike until the government changed its policy.

""We are trying to persuade the government to give up the ill-conceived idea of privatising Indian Oil which has tremendous historic and strategic significance,"" its president E Haque said.

All-India Petroleum Workmen Federation General Secretary C M Singh said the association would not move court against the decision as ""this government had scant regard for the judiciary as seen in the HPCL-BPCL case"". ""We would prefer the people''s court instead.""

Haque said despite the government deregulating the sector, no private sector company has put up a retail outlet or depot. He alleged that MNCs were trying to capture PSU assets at a very cheap rate.

The government is trying to split Indian Oil for disinvestment in the most ""cavalier fashion but we will try peaceful means before calling indefinite strike tentatively in the third or fourth week of November,"" T S Rangarajan, general secretary, Indian Oil Employees Union, Chennai, said.

He said that ""during the wars with Pakistan and China, the multinational companies had refused to supply fuel. IOC was formed out of this historic necessity and our value was understood as recently as in the Kargil War.""

Indian Oil, which began with an investment of Rs 82 crore has created an asset of Rs one lakh crore and paid cumulative taxes of Rs 5,995 crore till now, Haque said, adding the company paid Rs 33,000 crore as taxes and duties to the national exchequer in the fiscal 2002-03, accounting for 14 per cent of the government''s total tax collections.

The Assam Oil Company was merged with Indian Oil through an Act of Parliament in 1981, therefore any disinvestment of the petro giant can only be done with the approval of Parliament, Haque asserted.

11,Frame policy on cloud seeding: Krishna,"BANGALORE: A national policy on drought-proofing and cloud seeding is long overdue, Chief Minister S M Krishna said on Tuesday. A concerted effort by the central and state governments as well as private institutions was needed to frame a national policy.

Inaugurating a workshop on weather modification organised by the water resources department, Krishna said, ""When there is drought, our thoughts are focussed on rain but we stop at that.""

Four years of drought in Rajasthan and three years in Karnataka should provoke the government to come up with a national policy revolving around weather modification.

He pinned the causes of dramatic changes in climate systems in India on the country''s growing population and depleting forest resources. He also admitted that the social forestry division of the forest department had not been effective at the grassroot level in increasing forest resources.

He congratulated Water Resources Minister H K Patil for the success of cloud seeding operations in Karnataka that took off on August 25 this year.

""Only in Karnataka has such a concerted and organised effort been made in cloud seeding, despite our lack of knowledge and experience in the field,"" he said.

Earlier, H K Patil urged Krishna to set up an institute for weather modification in the state. Krishna wondered aloud if it would be wise to set up an institute and add to the plethora of existing ones or if instead a weather modification research cell could be set up in the water resources ministry.

Patil said that despite a large pool of trained defence and civil pilots, and defence infrastructure, they had not been employed to fight drought. ""I fail to understand this apathy,"" he said.

12,Krishna will lead Cong in polls: Vishwanath,"MYSORE: State Co-operation Minister Vishwanath, who had stirred a hornetâ€™s nest by issuing statement against alleged power grabbers in the Congress earlier, on Wednesday appeared to be cautious in airing his opinion on Jaffer Shariefâ€™s stand on Krishnaâ€™s leadership.

At a press meet here, he said usually it is a tradition in the Congress that if party is in power the chief minister and KPCC president lead the party in the elections. As on today it is Krishna and Janardhan Poojari who will lead the party in the next Assembly elections, he added.

However, he was quick enough to add that it is the party high command which will decide on leadership.

When asked specifically that what his feeling was on Jaffer Shariefâ€™s comments, Vishwanath said Sharief is a senior Congress leader and he has freedom to air his views. In the Congress, the high command culture exists and this is the culture which has kept the party united, he claimed adding that everybody in the party, irrespective of their stature will abide by the high command when it comes to taking decisions.

""We have freedom to air our views and this cannot be construed as indiscipline,"" he said adding that leaders of various community and caste groups will fight for their rights. But when it comes to elections and partyâ€™s survival, everybody will unite and protect it, he added.

13,‘Rally policy to keep in mind people’s problems’,"KOLKATA: The state government would take care of the problems faced by the common people because of rallies, advocate general Balai Roy said at the Writersâ€™ Buildings on Wednesday. â€œCommon peopleâ€™s opinion will be heard and the government will consider their problems,â€� he said.

The state government will have to submit a detailed report on its plans to minimise the clash between the rights of the rallyists and the public at large by November 12.

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held a marathon meeting with Roy along with senior officials including chief secretary S.N. Roy and police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborti on the issue.

Roy briefed them on the ramifications of the division bench stay on Justice Amitava Lalaâ€™s order. Both Bhattacharjee and Roy refused to elaborate the governmentâ€™s plan to journalists. â€œI cannot make it public before submitting it to the court,â€� the former argued.

14,CPM leader's arrest worries party,"KOLKATA: The continued detention of a CPM leader for the alleged involvement in the Naxalite attack in Purulia has left the partyâ€™s leadership worried.

Some leaders feel by detaining the leader, police are loosing sight of a renewed strategy adopted by Peopleâ€™s War.

Bandowan zonal committee member Mahendra Mahato was â€œpresentâ€� during a naxalite meeting the night preceding the attack; barely three kilometres away from the spot.

This, according to the party higher ups in the belt, is part of the new strategy to drag local CPM leaders to these underground meetings just to create confusion among villagers about their political integrity. The idea is to isolate the local CPM targets from their mass bases before killing them.

Instead of conniving, CPM leaders feel that their local partymen are becoming easy targets. The clout these leaders wield in remote village hamlets is considerable. For PW to gain a foothold it is imperative that they reverse this trend. Killing CPM men invites, heightened police action backed by a sustained political programme, sources said. Such action has kept Naxal activities confined to just 10 gram panchayats in the three districts bordering Jharkhand, they claim.

Leaders said though PW is raking up local issues promising better wages for bidi leaves they cannot keep extorting local traders for long. But they need to keep their word. They also need to browbeat CPM local leaders to put an end to their now heightened campaign against the PW, sources said.

The cops should have known better. Prior to the civic polls, a CPM panchayat leader in Belpahari, too, met the same fate. PW cadres, armed to teeth, had barged in Paribela Bhowmickâ€™s home and forced her to attend their meetings with villagers. Paribela was threatened at gunpoint when PW cadres held a meeting with local villagers. Mahato was not even at home when armed men barged in his home. They reportedly threatened his wife and forced Mahato to attend this meeting.

Threats are also on another CPM leader in Belpahari Anil Mahato, sources said. Chances are there that a section of villagers and a few within the CPM ranks are maintaining links with them out of fear or obligation.

District CPM leaders also claim that to escape police heat in Andhra Pradesh PW activists had actually set base in Ghatsila. They told it to the cops several months back. â€œWe even told them they are avoiding the Cuttack-Kharagpur train route, lest they get spotted,â€� said a senior leader. The reported presence of â€œTelegu speaking womenâ€� among the armed group who met in Purulia that night only vindicated their stand, they claimed.

On Tuesday the West Midnapore police recovered two detonators from the Belpahari jungles. Several months back a similar incident was reported to the Belpahari police. A SI had even gone there but never reported it to his superiors. The SI has since been censored by the then ASP.

The police would not speak on Mahatoâ€™s involvement with the attack. They, however, confirmed that even a few days before the attack several PW activists were trained how to detonate landmines. It is believed that among the seven arrested, two had been to this training camp. This duo, police claimed, had directly participated on Saturday attack.

15,Local farmers save Shantiniketan Express,"KOLKATA: The Howrah bound 3016Dn Shantiniketan Express narrowly escaped a major accident on Wednesday after a couple of youths raised an alarm and alerted the driver.

The farmers had seen a wide crack on the tracks on which the superfast train was running at top speed towards Howrah.

According to sources, at around 1.35 pm, some villagers were busy bringing their cattle to graze near the rail tracks when they first saw that the tracks were in an abnormal condition. On a closer look it was found that a wide crack had developed along one of the rails.

The men immediately decided to inform the station authorities of Guskara station, which was nearly a mile away. But, to their utter surprise, they suddenly heard the shril whistle of an engine. A passenger train was rushing on the same tracks, which had developed the cracks.

Understanding that a disaster was just waiting to happen, two farmers, residents of the nearby Shibdaha village of Guskara took a split a decision. Shankar Bagdi, took off his shirt and Sudeb snatched his red gamcha and started running towards the train, frantically waiving at the driver.

As soon as the driver of Shantiniketan Express R N Yadav saw the youths waiving from a distance, he pulled the emergency brakes and stopped the train merely four feet ahead of the cracks. Several passengers who got down from various coaches to see what had happened, were out of words to praise the duo''s courage. They gathered what they had in their pockets, collected two thousand six hundred rupees and handed it over to the Shankar and Sudeb.

Eastern Railway sources later in the day told TNN that an enquiry has been ordered to examine the reasons behind the crack on the tracks. The train had left Bolpur at 1.10 pm and arrived at Guskara on schedule. After the cracks were detected, the driver and the guard R N Gangopadhyay informed the authorities at Guskara. Soon all rail traffic was stopped on the Bolpur-Khana section on a temporary basis and the train was again brought back to Guskara station. It left for Howrah at 3.45 pm through the Up line tracks and finally reached Howrah at 6.20 pm, more than two and half hours behind schedule, a senior officer said.

16,Modi's Diwali gift to farmers,"GANDHINAGAR: Bowing to increasing pressure from the politically sensitive farmersâ€™ lobby, the Gujarat government on Wednesday scaled down the power tariff hike for the farm sector.

The last hike, which was announced in July, had led to a string of agitations from several farmersâ€™ organisations, including the BJPâ€™s ideological ally, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh. However, BKS state president Prafful Senjalia has turned down the governmentâ€™s partial rollback saying the organisation wants a complete withdrawal.

Sources said the government had offered a 25 to 33 per cent reduction in power tariff for farmers. In effect, it would mean the farmers using up to 7.5 horse-power HP) pumps would have to pay Rs 750 per HP per year instead of Rs 1,050. And farmers using higher HP motors would have to pay Rs 900 instead of Rs 1,200. The decision to scale down the hike, which Chief Minister Narendra Modi wants farmers to interpret as his Diwali gift to them, was taken after a marathon fourhour meeting of the fourmember ministerial committee formed on the issue.

The ministers â€” agriculture minister Bhupenndrasinh Chudasma, Kaushik Patel (revenue), Saurabh Patel (energy) and Anil Patel (industry) â€” had met BKS representatives earlier. The governmentâ€™s rollback will mean an additional burden on the state exchequer to the tune of Rs 200 crore per annum.

The tariff hike had been announced with a view to reduce the yearly budgeted subsidy of Rs 660 crore to the farmers, even while meeting half-way, the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) order of October 2000 that the state increase the tariff from Rs 350-500 per HP to Rs 1,760. Significantly, the ministerial committee met several times in recent weeks but failed to decide on the matter, even as the farmersâ€™ protests against the hike continued.

A few days ago, the BKS organised a â€˜mahakumbhâ€™ of farmers asking its members not to pay electricity bills. It is learnt the campaign against electricity bills was successful enough, with the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) failing to recover the dues. The CM was also getting feedback from BJP MLAs that the agitation would dent the popularity of the BJP in the rural areas.
