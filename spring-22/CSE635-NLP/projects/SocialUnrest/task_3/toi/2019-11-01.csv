1,12 BJP MLAs withdraw support to UP govt,"LUCKNOW: The Mayawati-led coalition government in Uttar Pradesh is in distress. A week after six independent MLAs withdrew support to the government, 12 rebel BJP MLAs met the governor Vishnukant Shastri on Thursday and told him that they have lost all faith in the government and urged him to convene the assembly for a trial of strength.

While the rebels were at their game, former BJP president Kushabhau Thakre was at a meeting with top state leaders at the party headquarters here.

The present position of the government is that after the withdrawal of the independents it is being held together by a wafer-thin margin. The required number is 202 and it now has 211.

Prior to the ""bombshell"" BJP suspended one more MLA, Kovid Kumar Singh for anti-party activities. Earlier, Ramashish Rai and Ganga Bhakt Singh were suspended.

The 12 dissidents along with Raghuraj Pratap Singh and other independents met the governor Vishnukant Shastri and submited the list of those who have ""lost confidence"" in the government.

They purposely avoided saying they were withdrawing support in order to escape the anti-defection law. They were confident of proving majority if assembly was summoned.

The MLAs said that they would like to form an alternative govenment and do not want a mid-term poll in the state. The dissidents said that they took the step because of unsympathetic attitude of the leadership.

Although in writing they have admitted to having lost faith, some of the rebels have gone on record to say they have ''withdrawn support''.

Among those who have lost faith in the government are: Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh, Kovind Kumar, Puran Singh Bundela, Indradeo Singh, Ram Praap Singh, Sarvesh Kumar, Ravindra Pundir, Narendra Singh Sishodia, Ganga Bux Sigh of Unnao, Chandramani Kant Singh, Anil Verma and Rakesh Verma. After handing over their letter to the governor Vishnu Kant Shastri, Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh and Ravindra Pundir told newsmen that this government is anti-people anti-poor and lost any right to rule the state.

Earlier, the former BJP president Kushabhau Thakre advised his partymen on Thursday to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards the party dissidents in the state. At a meeting of the senior leaders on Wednesday night it was felt that the doors for a compromise should be kept open in the larger interest of the party. It was also decided last night that a meeting of the rebels with Thakre should be facilitated. Thakre also felt that at the moment the threat of disciplinary actions should not be dangled on the dissidents and they should be brought back to the mainstream of the party.

2,Stay on regularisation of farm plots rapped,"PUNE: Former chief justice of the Bombay high court B N Deshmukh has said that chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had no powers to stay the Gunthewari Regularisation Act which had been approved by the state legislature.

This was disclosed by civic standing committee chairman Subhash Jagtap while addressing a press conference here on Wednesday.

He had demanded that the administration seek a legal opinion over the issue, pointing out that the stay order issued by the CM has affected over five lakh citizens staying in 1.3 lakh houses constructed on farm plots.

Jagtap had even threatened to move the high court if the stay was not vacated by November 15. Leaders of all political parties in the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) had also dashed off a letter to the CM urging him to vacate the stay.

Municipal commissioner T C Benjamin has taken a serious cognisance of the opinion of CJ Deshmukh and will call on the CM in Mumbai on Thursday, Jagtap said.

Interestingly, addressing another press conference on Wednesday, additional municipal commissioner D S Zagade pointed out that the CM has stayed the regularisation of the gunthewari constructions in the 23 fringe villages only.

Of the 1.30 lakh constructions, 85 per cent are in the 23 fringe villages, while the rest are in the main city area. The PMC has decided to go ahead with regularising these 15 per cent constructions.

Zagade announced that the last date for accepting the applications for regularising these 15 per cent constructions has been extended up to December 20.

Meanwhile, the Vidyanagar Pragati Mandal, an organisation representing the gunthewari property owners in Vidyanagar and Lohegaon held a press conference to announce their support to the stand taken by the CM and the NCP leaders.

Leaders of the Warje and Balajinagar gunthewari action committees also supported the demand made by Gosavi and Barate.

3,PSTDC disinvestment set rolling,"CHANDIGARH: The state government has finally set the ball rolling on the bumpy road for disinvestment in public sector units (PSUs). In spite of stiff opposition from within official quarters, to begin with the government resolved to commence the agonising process of disinvestment in two PSUs, Mumbai-based CONWARE and Punjab State Tourism Development Corporation.

The Cabinet committee on disinvestment, on Wednesday night, approved appointment of advisers for the two units and recommended that returns from these be utilised for capital receipts. Officials have been directed to prepare schemes for optimum utilisation of returns which are expected to touch Rs 400 crore. The process of disinvestment, however, is expected to be fraught with prolonged hiccups for it may, besides other things, entail an uproar from employees. PTDC employs around 500 people whereas CONWARE has no liability of permanent staff.

Agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal has been at the forefront of opposition to winding up of CONWARE, a state government depot for containers of export consignments. Situated at the Mumbai port, CONWAREâ€™s disinvestment was recommended as it served no purpose for the Punjab economy. Similarly, the proposal to close PTDC has also witnessed defiance from within official circles.

Earlier, the disinvestment commission headed by former chief secretary PH Vaishnav had also listed the two units among 29 PSUs recommended to be either wo-und up or restructured in view of their financial inviability. While mooting winding up of PTDC, the commission suggested that the existing staff be paid adequate compensation for its retrenchment even as evaluation of PTDC properties should be carried out on commercial rates. The commission suggested that the task of facilitating tourist infrastructure be entrusted to the proposed Punjab Infrastructure Development Corporation.

Apart from disinvestment in the two PSUs, earlier the state initiated the process of withdrawing shares of Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation from three units, Punjab Tractors, PUNCOM and Punjab Alkalis and Chemicals Ltd. The process is expected to be completed by July next year.

However, the proposal to wind up five PSUs chalked out more than 10 years ago is still hanging fire. With an accumulated equity worth Rs 12 crore, the five units are Punjab Films Corporation, Puntex, Punwac, Punjab State Leather Development Corporation and Punjab State Hosiery and Knitwear Development Corporation. The matter has been pending with the assets reconstruction company for disposal of liabilities and completing of the winding up process.

4,Mayawati holds meeting with party workers,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawati on Thursday held a meeting of BSP workers from five divisions including Allahabad, Gorakhpur and Faizabad.

Addressing party workers, the chief minister said her government was taking suitable steps to protect the interests of the weaker sections, including scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the state. She thanked the BSP workers for making the dhikkar rally a success.

She also criticised the Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav. Cautioning BSP workers, she said they should not install the statue of Ambedkar or any other public leader at public places without prior permission from district magistrates.

She cautioned the workers that the coalition government was not a BSP government. Mayawati said the government had fostered friendship between the Bahujan Samaj and the Sarvjan Samaj. Regarding the governmentâ€™s precarious economic condition, she assured the workers that things would improve. She also asked the workers to prepare for the Lok Sabha poll.

She said that certain parties, which were scared of BSPâ€™s increasing popularity and ever expanding party base, were trying to plant in the BSP vested elements, that could cause problems for the party in future.

She directed all regional BSP coordinators that they should not allow new persons to join the party without her permission.

5,Rebels' chargesheet against government,"LUCKNOW: The charges levelled by the dissident MLAs against the chief minister Mayawati suggest that their decision to meet the governor was not taken in haste and a good deal of homework had been done before they headed for the Rajbhawan on Thursday evening.

To begin with, the MLAs charged the CM of a poor attendance in the House which reflected poorly on her level of seriousness towards the legislature. The letter also points out the insult caused to the independent MLAs by the deeds and statements of the government. Citing examples, it mentions about the government announcement that no independent MLA would be inducted in the ministry. It also talks about the government''s stand on MLCs, which said that they also couldn''t be inducted in the cabinet as they had already been elected by the MLAs. The letter questions the government if such statements were in the right perspective?

The MLAs had alleged that the government was working not on the lines of ''law of the land'' but ''law of the administration''. The issue of large-scale transfers in gross violation of the Apex court directives and sidelining the recommendations of the committee headed by the chief secretary also finds mention in the letter. The MLAs also charged the government with frequent transfers of senior IAS officials and issuing of secret directives to bureaucrats to work for the benefit of a particular party.

Issues like encouragement to select officials being posted to ensure insult to MLAs and reject their recommendations, money exchanging hands for facilitating transfers and postings also figured in the five-page ''chargesheet'' which the MLAs handed over to the governor. The MLAs have also highlighted the fact that criminal cases against members of the cabinet were being withdrawn while legislators of coalition partners were being framed in false cases.

It also highlights the statements of the government on issues related to World Bank and Ambedkar villages which suggested that the government was not only taking the members of the assembly for a ride but also misleading the public on such issue of public interest.

6,Uddhav tells Shiv Sainiks to be prepared for elections,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray has urged party workers to be prepared for the state legislative assembly elections. He said the Sena's strategy was to undertake a mass contact crusade in a bid to double the party's present strength of 70 legislators.""The DF government wasted its three years in power in trading charges against the former Sena-BJP government. How long are the DF ministers going to cover up their incompetence by saying that we emptied the state's coffers? The state government has woefully failed to improve the lot of the farmers,"" he said.Mr Thackeray was addressing a meeting, held on Tuesday, of the Sena's women's wing. The conclave deliberated on a time-bound programme for the mahila aghadi which, he pointed out, was expected to strengthen its network at the grassroot level.Mr Thackeray exhorted party activists to ban ministers from entering villages. ""Scarcity and shortages have brought gloom in every household in Maharashtra on the eve of Divali. The ministers have no right to flaunt the red light atop their vehicles as they have done nothing to tackle problems such as load-shedding and nonpayment of the farmers' dues,"" the Sena leader said.The Sena has launched a statewide stir to coincide with the third anniversary of the DF rule. On Monday, Mr Uddhav Thackeray led a well-attended morcha in Amravati to highlight the ineptitude of the DF government. Last week, leader of the opposition Narayan Rane released a book-let chronicling the ""ills"" of the DF government.Again, the party has been organising a series of 'rasta-rokos' in Mumbai and other parts of the state in a bid to consolidate its political base.Sena MPs and MLAs have been instructed to conduct protest rallies and meetings in their constituencies to gather steam on the state government.

7,State BJP chief assails Rabri govt,"SAMASTIPUR: The Bihar state president of the BJP Nand Kishore Yadav inaugurated a two-day meeting of the Bihar State Working Committee of the BJP here on Thursday. He came down heavily on the Bihar government which is being supported by the Congress for the vested interests of the Congress ministers in the government, he alleged.

Yadav said that Laloo had retained power in the state by appealing to caste sentiments and development is a non-issue for him. Praising the Vajpayee government at the Centre for its developmental schemes, he alleged that the Laloo-Rabri government had failed to implement those schemes which had further made the state and its people poorer. The fund allotted to Bihar for its development was not being utilised, he said and exhorted the 250 delegates participating in the meeting to tell the people about the developmental projects and the achievements of the Vajpayee government so that the people can launch a decisive battle against Lalooâ€™s misrule for a change in the coming assembly and parliamentary elections.

He also criticised Laloo for his recent statements for the members of the Bhumihar caste. He said that the Bihar government is totally indifferent to the deteriorating law and order situation in the state and had allowed the kidnapping industry to thrive and carnages to take place. He charged that the RJD men were involved in the proliferation of the kidnapping industry and it couldnâ€™t be expected that Laloo-Rabri government would take action against them.

He lamented that the Laloo-Rabri government is yet to implement the panchayati raj, though it was forced to conduct gram panchayat elections by the Patna High Court He said that a convention of the elected representatives of gram panchayats would be organised in Patna on November 26 to discuss the problem of the empowerment of gram panchayats which still remained a distant dream in the state.

Yadav said that to counter the RJD governmentâ€™s policies in Bihar, the BJP would come out with the slogan of development which was the demand of the majority of the people of all castes and communities in the state. The Laloo-Rabri government must go, he said, if Bihar is to develop and come out of the present crisis.

Besides the delegates, several state and national level party functionaries, legislators and ministers are participating in the meet and are likely to address the â€˜Hisab Doâ€™ rally of the party here on Friday.

Many people here, however, were surprised to find that the national president of the BJP Venkaiah Naidu and several other top leaders who the local leaders had said would come over here to grace the occasion.

9,Rising rabies incidents dog city,"HYDERABAD: With the dog menace increasing, the number of people being administered anti-rabies vaccine as well as people succumbing to the disease has been on a steady increase during the last five years, according to statistics available with the Institute of Preventive Medicine here.In 1997-98, about 46,430 anti-rabies shots were given, while in 1998-99, about 42,940 vaccines were given. The year 1999-2000 saw 45,797 victims being administered the vaccine, while 45,948 were given the vaccine in 2000-2001.In 2001-2002, the number was 47,416, while from April to September this year, 27,256 people were already given anti-rabies shots. ""About 70 per cent of the cases that come to IPM for anti-rabies vaccine are children. Out of these, just about two to three per cent are bites by pet dogs,"" said a senior doctor at the IPM.The number of people who have succumbed to rabies in 1997 were 15, in 1998 (20), 1999 (34), 2000 (35), and 2001 (36). This year, from April, as many as 16 people have died due to rabies.The anti-rabies shot is given for seven to ten days, plus two booster doses, depending on the number of bites, place of wound, type of animal, and whether the victim is an adult or a child.""Even if 80 per cent of the stray dogs are sterilised, the incidence of rabies will come down over the next few years,"" said the IPM doctor.Incidentally, the city is home to a little more than two lakh stray dogs, which is more than the number of children enrolled in government schools in the entire state — 83,335.In an incident, about two months ago, a scooterist sustained a head injury and died in Gachibowli due to a stray dog crossing the road at night.

10,Credit policy triggers fresh hopes,"MUMBAI: For debt fund managers of asset management companies, the credit policy has triggered fresh hopes for improving returns from income schemes by exploiting trading opportunities.

Several private sector fund managers have made it clear that policy-led rally in government securities will enable them to post over 10 per cent (annualised) returns for the next six months, at least 200 basis points higher than earlier expectations.

""For the last three months, gilt schemes of mutual funds have generated 35 per cent returns, with over 30 per cent returns generated from capital appreciation and remaining from interest accruals. This was possible due the consistent fall in yields over the last one year (aggregating to over 200 basis points) and this has pushed up the net asset values of all income schemes. Though we feared that this is the end of the road and there is no more scope for trading opportunities till the policy was announced. Now at least in the short-term, more trading opportunities exist and therefore better returns,"" said a fund manager in SBI Mutual Fund.

On Tuesday, several government papers witnessed a rally of 25-55 basis points in prices and the benchmark 10-year 7.40 per cent paper closed at Rs 103.30, marginally higher than Mondayâ€™s close at Rs 102.80.

""We expect a correction in bond prices in a weekâ€™s time. Since the liquidity overhang in the money market is substantial, the central bank itself will conduct an open market operation sometime next week to bring back stability in the system,"" said an analyst in Motilal Oswal Securities.

12,No alternative govt possible in UP: Naidu,"NEW DELHI: BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday expressed hope that an ""amicable and honourable"" settlement would be found to the situation arising out of rebellion by a dozen dissident BJP MLAs in Uttar Pradesh. He also asserted that no alternative government was possible to the BSP-BJP coalition.

""There is no possibility of an alternative government. Only BSP and BJP could provide a stable Government as they have the capacity and the required strength,"" Naidu told reporters at the party headquarters when asked about the rebellion in the state BJP.

Noting that there have been conflicting versions about what the dissident MLAs have told Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri on Thursday night, he said that party leaders Kalraj Mishra, Rajnath Singh and former party president Kushabhau Thakre are keeping a watch on the situation.

""We want the government to continue and be stable. The image of the party to be intact and discpline to be maintained,"" while resolving the issue, he said.

Asked about the demand by the dissidents for action against state BJP legislature party leader Lalji Tandon, he shot back: ""We do not not discuss such demands in press conferences.""

Naidu was closeted with Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani for some time after they participated in the National Executive of the BJP Mahila Morcha.

The Governor denied they had withdrawn support from the government.

Stating that the Kargil War reminded him of two things - matryrdom and betrayal, the Prime Minister said when he undertook the Lahore bus trip, ""Our neighbour chose a spot (to attack) that was comparatively not very secure"".

""Peace talks in Lahore and war in Kargil. This was betrayal,"" Vajpayee asserted.

16,SAD protest will not lead to militancy: Badal,"CHANDIGARH: Former Punjab chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Parkash Singh Badal has discounted the possibility of his partyâ€™s agitation leading to the revival of militancy in the state.

Talking to mediapersons here on Friday, Badal said his partyâ€™s proposed agitation on November 15 would be a one-day â€˜jail bharoâ€™ programme in support of its 15-point charter of demands. On that day, thousands of party leaders would stage demonstrations and court arrest, he said. Badal said that SAD leaders would not take recourse to any kind of violence, but would demonstrate in a peaceful manner.

He, however, did not say whether he would court arrest or not. The party would decide about this a few days before November 15, he said. At Muktsar, his home district, his nephew Manpreet Singh Badal, MLA, would lead the protest, said Badal.

He said the course of action after the November 15 agitation would be decided later. Claiming that the Amarinder government had created a situation of confrontation in the state with his party having been forced to resort to agitation, Badal said that this would in no way lead to the revival of militancy.

Blaming the state government for creating â€˜â€˜anarchyâ€� in Punjab, Badal said, â€˜â€˜It is a jungle raj in the state where people are being threatened and intimidated.â€� He took exception to the manner in which the police had been browbeating SGPC members in the Badal group. â€˜â€˜It is a shame to see the police torturing and intimidating the kin of SGPC members,â€� Badal said. â€˜â€˜An officer of the rank of SP is hounding SGPC members and their kin, creating an atmosphere of terror in the state,â€� he added.

The stamps are in denominations of Rs 15 and Rs 50. The police have also seized two computers, printers and scanners from the shop. Jain has been running the racket over the past one year.

""He is a high school graduate. Later, he did a computer course and started running a data operating unit in Gandhinagar,"" a police officer said. According to the police, Jain was supplying the fake stamps to two persons in Delhi. While one has a licence to sell postal stamps in the market, the other does not. The police are looking for the two.

""Jain used to sell them fake-stamps at a rate less than the denominated price. A fake stamp with a face value of Rs 50 was sold to them for Rs 20. In the market, however, the two accomplices sold it for the actual rate,"" the office said.

The police got information about this. A police constable in the garb of a decoy customer visited Jain''s shop and projected himself as a potential buyer.

To convince Jain, the constable first purchased stamps for Rs 1,000. He later asked Jain to come to Pratap Nagar to meet him. He also placed an order for stamps worth Rs 20,000 which he was going to buy at half the cost from Jain.

When the accused was caught red-handed as he was handing over the stamps to the police personnel in Pratap Nagar.

18,23 held after violence in Delhi University,"NEW DELHI: A protest against the provost of Jubilee Hall in Delhi University turned violent when its residents, along with office bearers of Delhi University Students'' Union (DUSU), started pelting stones at the vice-chancellor''s office.

The police used lathicharge and tear gas to bring the students under control. More than 200 policemen were stationed outside the V-C''s office. About 23 students were detained, 13 of whom were Jubilee Hall residents.

The police said residents of Jubilee Hall had been protesting since Thursday night after one of them was allegedly slapped by the provost, S C Jain.

""The residents had threatened to break into the V-C''s house. They were demanding Jain''s resignation,"" a police officer said.

""The local police had come to us and asked us to stop the protest. They advised us to meet the V-C on Friday morning. The deputy commissioner of police (north) Sanjay Baniwal promised to help us,"" a resident from Jubilee Hall said. The residents, however, sat on a silent protest through Thursday night.

On Friday, a group of students comprising two residents from the hall and DUSU office bearers went to meet the V-C at 3 pm. He allegedly refused to see them. They were asked to meet the pro V-C, who also reportedly refused to let them come into his office.

Finally, the dean of colleges Kiran Dattar agreed to meet the students, who stuck to their demand for Jain''s resignation. The meeting, which lasted for about 45 minutes, did not yield results, with both parties sticking to their stands.

By the time the group came out of Dattar''s office, their supporters had already gathered inside the V-C''s office. Since the police was aware of the students'' protest, several personnel were deployed there.

The police first requested the students to calm down. However, the students reportedly got more violent. At 4.30 pm, the police resorted to lathicharge.

""The lathicharge lasted for almost an hour,"" said joint commissioner of police (northern range) Ranjit Narayan said. ""The police did not injure anybody. It was only a deterrent,"" he said.

The Jubilee Hall controversy has been going on for the past two years. DUSU members allege there is no transparency in the administration of the hostel.

""The hostel administration has not conducted elections for students representatives to the hostel committee for the past two years,"" DUSU president Nakul Bhardwaj said. Jubilee Hall students were reportedly paying higher mess bills compared with their counterparts in other post-graduate hostels, he said.

DUSU members said that they had raised the issue several times but to no avail. ""The dissatisfaction of students with the hostel administration finally snowballed into Friday''s incident,"" another member said.

19,Fighting JNU elections through perky posters,"NEW DELHI: Just like debating and discussion, huge hand-drawn posters plastered in hostels and canteens have become a part and parcel of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union elections.

These important vehicles for disseminating campaign messages can be as long as 10 feet, stretching all the way from the roof to the floor. With the November 8 poll date drawing near, student groups are busy measuring the poster space allocated to them and holding poster workshops.

""Posters are ideal for putting across a point. And as most of them have the names of the candidates on them, they facilitate easy recall,"" a student said.

In fact, students said the tradition of making posters is as old as the practice of holding student union elections.

There is fixed space for displaying posters â€” walls of the 13 hostels, the school and library canteens and the K C market, election committee chairperson Sowesh Pattanaik said.

The posters are starkly different from the glamourous and expensive posters of candidates that are plastered all over the city during Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) elections.

In JNU, the posters are portray the campaign issues. Take for instance, the Leftist combine of the Students Federation of India and All India Students'' Federation (SFI-AISF), which is raising issues like saffronisation of education, the highhanded attitude of the United States and the impending attack on Iraq. The group has already prepared a poster highlighting the Godhra incident.

""In-campus employment"" for students coming from deprived backgrounds may become an important issue in this election. The theme of the Right-wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad''s (ABVP) posters will be terrorism, employment and the alleged inability of the ruling group to fulfil the mandate.

The extreme Left-wing All India Students Association (AISA) plans to highlight the Gujarat genocide, the controversy over the X plan proposal and employment for students in its posters.

Not surprisingly, the artistic students are busy dabbling in colour and putting down ideas on paper. ""We hold night-long poster workshops, where everybody is encouraged to give ideas and draw,"" SFI member Albeena Shakil said.

While the elections end, the memories of some posters lingers on. ""There was a poster which showed BJP leaders Murli Manohar Joshi and Advani putting students in a machine that produced party cadre at the other end. It was striking and conveyed the message,"" said another supporter.

However, oldtimers feel that symbolism is fading out of posters. ""Nowadays, student groups confine themselves to depicting the obvious or writing names of candidates,"" Tanvir Akhtar, JNUSU president in 1991 from the National Students Union of India (NSUI) said.

When he was campaigning, the Babri mosque was demolished in Ayodhya. And there is one poster that has stuck to his memory - of a chopped hand dripping blood, accompanied with a slogan that said violence would destroy everything.
