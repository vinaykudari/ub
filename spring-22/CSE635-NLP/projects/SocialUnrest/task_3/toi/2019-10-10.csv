0,Govt inconsistent with defaulters,"LUCKNOW: It was not very long ago that the UPPCL had launched its anti-theft and revenue-realisation drive, generating much hype. The heavyweight defaulters had been booked and high-profile power thieves identified.

Even the former chief ministers were not spared. Barely three months have passed since then and things are back to square one. So, while over 3000 small power defaulters have been arrested since April, most of the VIP defaulters, whose connections were snapped in July, are still using power without paying regular instalments. Same is the case with most of the defaulting government departments.

On Wednesday, when a LESA team, led by SDO Clyde Road detected an illegal power connection at District Urban Development Authorityâ€™s (Duda) office at Newal Kishore Road, they were manhandled. A complaint has been lodged with the Hazratganj police in this regard. The staff had gone to provide a fresh connection to a consumer in the locality, when it discovered that the Duda office was drawing electricity illegally from the connection given to an LNN hospital situated nearby.

Interestingly, on Wednesday itself the state government issued a press release saying that â€œEvery fourth power consumer indulges in irregularitiesâ€�. It also said that 3102 consumers were arrested during a drive between April and September on charges of power theft and 6927 FIRs were lodged all over the state. Out of 84,866 premises raided, power officials detected 5,569 cases of power consumption more than the sanctioned load, 2,499 cases of peak hour violation and 5,580 cases of other irregularities. A total 27,845 power connections were snapped and around Rs 50.37 crore of dues were realised from 49,320 consumers and 11,690 power connections were snapped for outstanding dues.

Significantly, the release has no mention of over Rs 23,00 crore pending against government departments out of which around Rs 985 crore are due on various water works, Rs 500 crore on irrigation department, Rs 250 crore on street light department and others, including police department. The release also does not mention about the government and the UPPCLâ€™s failure to realise dues worth Rs 1,511 crore pending against two private power distribution companies, Kesco (Rs 1,100 crore) and Noida Power Company (Rs 411 crore).

Although the chief secretary had recently announced that all government departments should pay their dues, nothing had been said as to what would be done against those departments not complying with the order.

According to sources, against the permissible limit of 27 per cent, there have been average line losses of over 40 per cent in the state, which means an annual loss of Rs 800-Rs 1000 crore.

1,Two arrested for making pirated CDs,"LUCKNOW: The Kaiserbagh Police on Tuesday arrested the vice-president of Video Library Owners Association and one of his associates in connection with producing pirated CDs of Hindi films and selling blue films.

Acting on a tip-off, police raided a house in Kaiserbagh and arrested Anil Singhal and Arvind Kumar. Singhal, the vice-president of Video Library Owners Association, and Santosh were involved in making of pirated CDs of Hindi films and other obscene films.

Police seized 500 blank CDs, 320 dubbed Hindi film CDs, 500 copied CDs and 62 those of blue films along with packets of posters, CD covers and pamphlets.

Police said that Singhal used to get the CDs dubbed through Santosh, who had installed a CD writer and other gadgetry, and then sell it off. He also owns Modern Video Library at Cantonment crossing. This shop was allegedly being used by the two as a counter to sell off these CDs.

The two were booked under charges of Copyrights Act and Cinematography Act and sent to jail. Police said that the arrested accused provided details of many of their clients to whom the CDs were sold off in retail. Efforts were on to trace them and recover the CDs.

2,Salman’s arrest sparks debate in city,"LUCKNOW: On an average, 10,000 persons are killed each year in traffic related mishaps in UP. But, that has never stirred the authorities to start even a debate on traffic related laws.

However, the arrest of cinestar Salman Khan on charges of culpable homicide has for sure generated some interest among senior police officials of this largest police force in the world. Whether they take steps to check the trend, or will the enthusiasm die as the case pales into the background, is anybodyâ€™s guess.

Will the Salman episode become a test case for the many accidents due to rash and negligent driving and other such incidents? While many in the police force think that section 304 of IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) was rightly slapped on Salman, there are others who think otherwise. â€œThat is because,â€� they feel, â€œthere is no motive for the incidentâ€�.

Director Traffic BS Sidhu says, normally it is section 304 (A) of IPC (death due to negligence) that is applicable in road mishap deaths. â€œBut an action which is in all probability likely to cause death can come under section 304.â€� He says a person driving at 150 km per hour and nearing a Mela site is presumed to know he can cause death to someone passing from the congested area at such a speed and hence can be charged under section 304. But was Salman aware there were people sleeping on the footpath and that he would crush them as well? â€œI do not know the exact details of the case hence cannot comment on that,â€� Sidhu adds.

â€œThere should be an element of motive when police charge someone under section 304,â€� says deputy director traffic Jamal Ashraf.

Though, prima facie, Salman did not have any motive in this particular case, one can only deduce that he was harried by the goings-on in his personal life and may have just erred,â€� elucidates another officer hinting on how a simple 304(A) can be altered into 304 IPS itself.

DIG Lucknow Range Arun Kumar too admits that in general circumstances it is 304 (A). â€œI remember an incident which took place in Bareilly when I was posted there. A truck rammed into a house and the four occupants who were watching television were killed on the spot,â€� Arun recollected saying that he got the driver booked under 304 IPC.

3,Theresa Bank chief arrested for fraud,"HYDERABAD: The Mother Theresa Bank chairman T Charles and his wife Arpana Charles were arrested here on Wednesday.

A police team, which raided the bank premises on Wednesday and seized financial documents, found that the bank issued cash credit limits and term loans in the name of bogus concerns.

Particulars such as borrowerâ€™s address and purpose of loan was unavailable in many cases, police said. The value of properties mortgaged to the bank too were exaggerated, police added.

The bank had Rs 3.5 crore deposits and Rs 3.9 crore in loans and advances. Out of the total deposits, a major chunk was that of employee associations such as the Secretariat Employees Co-operative Credit Society (Rs 15 lakh), A G Office Employees Association (Rs 25 lakh) and the Bank of India Employees Association (Rs 20 lakh). The Trinity Co-o-op also has a deposit of Rs 25 lakh.

4,Development relegated to back seat in Anakapalli,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu''s plea not to let politics be an impediment for development notwithstanding, his own party men in the district have become stumbling blocks to various development activities in the Anakapalli Assembly segment.

The differences between Anakapalli MP Ganta Srinivasa Rao and MLA Dadi Veerabhadra Rao have reached such a level that not a single work could be taken up under the MP Land Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) in the Anakapalli Assembly constituency for the past two-and-half years.

Both the MP and MLA have so far not taken oath at the Anakapalli Municipal Council, ever since it received a humiliating defeat in the last local bodies elections. The Congress won the municipality with 26 wards, whereas the TDP could get only two wards and the BJP managed to win four in the 32-member Anakapalli municipality.

However, the MP has sanctioned about Rs 17 lakh for taking up water supply works under MPLADS in the municipal limits of Anakapalli, but those works are yet to be taken up.

Vexed with these developments, about a dozen Congress counsellors, led by the civic body chairman and Congress leader Konathala Jagan had gone to MP GantaSrinivasa Rao''s house in the city. They pleaded with him to take oath as a civic body member and support the development activities being taken up in the municipal limits. The embarrassed MP, however, is yet to react. Vanishing act

Many sarpanches and village secretaries have performed a vanishing act at the recently held gram sabhas throughout the district. These gram sabhas are held once in six months by the district administration as a mandatory exercise. Several villages in the district witnessed altercations, hurling of challenges and protests throughout the week at the gram sabhas.

Sarpanches and village secretaries had no reply when villagers poured out their grievances regarding lack of drinking water and erratic power supply. In several villages, many sarpanches did not turn up at the gram sabhas, while at some other places, they closed the proceedings abruptly, prompting protests from villagers.

The villagers of Rajupet village obstructed the proceedings when the upa sarpanch tried to conduct the grama sabha.

Several farmers demanded an assessment of the crop loss due to drought and sought compensation from the government. In fact, women in Totada village attended the gram sabha with empty pots in protest against the administration''s negligence towards repair of a drinking water pipeline.

5,Decision on stalled disinvestment of HMT soon: Patil,"NEW DELHI: Heavy Industries Minister Balsaheb Vikhe Patil on Wednesday said the ministry would soon take a decision on the stalled disinvestment of subsidiaries Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT).

Stating that disinvestment of the subsidiaries of HMT had been stalled mainly on account of the recession, Patil told reporters, ""a decision will be taken within a month''s time"".

Asked if the decision to stall a disinvestment process already under way would not send wrong signals, Patil said, ""it is not a question of sending a wrong signal. One should not rush such processes. A proper assessment of the value has to be made and the unit must be sold at the right time to fetch the right price"".

State owned HMT had in July this year invited bids for offloading majority stake in a host of subsidiaries including HMT Machine Tools (HMT-MT).

The PSU had proposed to divest 74 per cent stake in four subsidiaries namely HMT Watches (HMTW), HMT Chinar Watches (HMT Chinar) and HMT Bearings (HMTB) and Ernst and Young had been appointed as global advisors for the deal.

Responding to queries regarding his stand on disinvestment, the minister said, ""it is upto the government to decide what is to be sold and when. However, the core sectors which includes areas like space, defence, and other areas of national security such as power must be retained in the public domain"".

Declining to comment on whether he considered oil sector as a core sector, Patil said he was not in favour of creation of a monopoly in any sector as ""vast competition gives consumer access to better prices"".

Asked if he had received a response from Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to his letter suggesting revised guidelines for disinvestment, Patil said, ""the PM has encouraged a discussion"".

Patil said disinvestment should follow a three-pronged approach of disposing or selling of units which are already closed down or those which cannot be revived while those that can be revived should be considered for revival or restructuring.

While decision to disinvest rested with the government, the public route was favourable to the strategic sale route as it allowed greater accountability, he said, adding, another option was the creation of joint ventures or consortium both within the government and with the private sector. These options, he said should be taken up on a case by case basis.

Asked if the ministry had sought any additional budgetary support for PSUs which had been identified for revival, Patil said, ""the ministry is examining the issue and we will take a decision on a case by case basis"".

Of the 49 PSUs under the ministry, only seven PSUs are closed, 14 are making profits and 13 are making losses.

6,Mamata calls govt austerity steps a publicity stunt,"KOLKATA: The austerity drive launched by the West Bengal government was a mere publicity stunt, claimed Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Tuesday. â€œMany such plans made in the past have come to a naught. Those who actually work do so quietly. They do not hanker for publicity,â€� she said. According to her, the CPM-led government should have announced that it would not be able to pay full bonus to the employees before the Assembly elections.

â€œBiman Bose has no following within his own party. Wherever he goes to address a rally before the elections, the CPM loses,â€� replied Mamata countering the Front chairmanâ€™s comments that West Bengal was better off as many states even failed to pay salaries. â€œThe bureaucrats are asked to take austerity measures.

What about the ministers? The chief ministerâ€™s train trip was a gim-mick. There were a few passengers in that train. The government is talking about austerity but spending lakhs on advertisements,â€� she claimed. Mamata further claimed that there were many honest and efficient bureaucrats in the state who were not being allowed to work. â€œWhat is all this talk about Central loan? If they required Rs 900 crore, the state government should have asked us to lobby for them. We could have got them double the amount,â€� she asserted.

Meanwhile, the Trinamul Congress may spring a surprise on Wednesday when both Mamata and dissident MP Ajit Panja share the dais at the inauguration of the Durga Puja at Santosh Mitra Square. Sources revealed that mayor Subrata Mukherjee was trying to bring about a rapprochement between the two before the panchayat polls. The Trinamul will launch its agitation against the stateâ€™s economic policies after the Pujas. A meeting at the Brigade would also be held on December 18.

7,Tight security after arrest of Bangladeshi national,"KOLKATA: Security was beefed up in vulnerable places here on Wednesday following arrest of Fazle Karim, a Bangladesh national, at Sealdah station. Karim was produced at Sealdah court during the day and remanded in police custody till October 23.

State police additional director general (CID) S.I.S. Ahmed said the arrest took place on Tuesday. Karim was coming from UP and reached Sealdah by the Jammu Tawi Express. â€œHis movements at station aroused suspicion the basis of which he was arrested,â€� Ahmed said. CID sources said, however, police had a tip-off based which sleuths of the special operation group had kept watch at the station. Police were clueless as to why Karim â€“ who hails from Chittagong â€“ had gone to UP.

They are probing whether he had links with a militant outfit. He was booked under the Foreignersâ€™ Act for travelling without valid documents. Fazle had gone to Muzaffarpur in Bihar a few times earlier to attend religious conventions. â€œWithin two days, we will requisition him interrogation while he is CID custody,â€� said Gaurav Dutta, DC (special branch) of Kolkata Police.

As part of the general alert, security has been beefed up at Sealdah station, said SRP (Sealdah) Gangeswar Singh. The police started frisking passengers there, albeit selectively. Surveillance was also intensified. Sniffer dogs were deployed at Sealdah and Howrah stations. Bomb detecting equipmentâ€� had also been placed at the disposal of the railway police the two stations.

Intelligence agencies said threat perception had increased after terrorist attacks on the American Cen-ter and the Akshardham temple. It was essential to step up vigil before Durga Puja. Security arrangements at Puja pandals have been upgraded and anti-sabotage checks will be conducted at big pandals. DC (headquarters) Sivaji Ghosh said, â€œWe will stay alert to react fast in case of an incident.â€� A man was arrested at a Zakaria Street guest house on Wednesday morning. Two Army maps and incriminating literature were recovered from the man who refused to disclose his identity.

9,PDP prefers Mufti as CM in coalition govt,"NEW DELHI: Hinting at forming a coalition government with Congress in the event of a hung assembly, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday said the Chief Minister should preferably be from Kashmir valley and its preference would be party chief Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.

PDP vice president Muzaffar Baig said the best choice from the Congress and PDP should head the coalition government who should have expertise and background.

""We are not pushing for anything. We will explore the possibility of the Chief Minister through consultations,"" Baig said, adding but the person heading the government should have such an expertise and background.

Stating that there could be a dilemma on the issue of chief ministership, he said if the Congress gets majority from Jammu province, there could be a demand from there that the chief minister be from that region.

""We will appreciate that. But the ground realities have to be kept in mind as Kashmiris have aspirations and a Chief Minister from Kashmir valley can establish a rapport with militants for a dialogue,"" he said.

To a question, he said the Congress and PDP, an offshoot of the Congress, had convergence of views particularly on holding talks with separatists to resolve the Kashmir issue.

Congress President Sonia Gandhi made a very important policy statement during her address at a public meeting in Srinagar last month that the Kashmir issue should be resolved through negotiations, a view supported by the PDP, Baig said.

10,NDA allies describe polls as victory for democracy,"NEW DELHI: Key NDA allies Samata Party and Janata Dal (United) on Thursday said the free and fair polls in Jammu and Kashmir was a major victory for democracy irrespective of its outcome.

They said the outcome of the assembly elections was not important as what was significant was the impressive turnout of voters showing faith in democracy defying terrorist threats.

""The people of Jammu and Kashmir have established supremacy of ballots over bullets and that the polling was free and fair should no more be in doubt,"" Samata Party General Secretary Shambhu Shrivastwa said.

He said the international community have seen the ugly face of cross border terrorism during these elections. ""It is time that the world community becomes more sensitive towards India''s resolve to end terrorism,"" he added.

Commenting on the election results, Janata Dal (United) Spokesman K C Tyagi said the impressive turnout of voters marked the victory of secularism, democracy and national sovereignty.

""The free and fair election in the state is a slap on the face of those who lay claim on our territory,"" he added.

11,Omar Abdullah to quit NDA govt,"SRINAGAR: Unfazed by the National Conference''s defeat in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections, its president and Minister of State for External Affairs Omar Abdullah on Thursday said that he would resign from the Vajpayee government, but added that continuance of his party in the NDA was an open question.

""I will resign from the NDA ministry once Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee returns from abroad,"" Omar, who lost to PDP candidate Qazi Mohammad Afzal from Ganderbal seat, said.

To a question about the continuance of National Conference in the NDA, he said ""we will not be part of the government any more but remaining in the alliance is still an open question"".

Omar further said that his party would not stake claim to form a government in the state even if it emerged as the single-largest party.

""There will be self introspection and we will try to figure out where things went wrong,"" he said, adding he had accepted the defeat gracefully and would start afresh and bring new life into the party.

Asked about the reasons for the party''s humiliating defeat, he said ""lot of this has to be answered by the MLAs and senior leaders of the party who were in power for last six years"".

Dismissing a suggestion that the NC had lost the elections because of Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, he said that the reasons for the drubbing needed to be gone into and it would be difficult to say at this moment that the people were unhappy with the NC and wanted to punish it.

He further said that unavailability of the MLAs and ministers to the people had cost the party dearly.

Congratulating Afzal for his victory from Ganderbal, the 32-year-old National Conference president said that he would continue working for the people of the state.

12,"BG, ONGC inch closer to resolving row","NEW DELHI: British oil and gas major BG Group and state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation are believed to have agreed on Thursday to make concessions to resolve by the month-end the contentious issue of operating Tapti gas and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields.

While British Gas and ONGC seemed to agree on evolving an integrated joint operatorship model, management of about $750 million investment to boost output from the offshore field remained to be resolved, informed sources said.

BG group chairman Richard Giordano and CEO Frank Chapman met ONGC chairman and managing director Subir Raha on Thursday and for the first time in the eight-month long dispute, indicated that it might not insist on being nominated the sole operator of the field.

Sources said that Raha did not press for his earlier model of joint operatorship where ONGC was to get CEO''s post, and only sounded BG top brass on the need for involving Indian partners in establishing a transparent and creditable model of management, especially in managing funds.

Giordano and Chapman, who had on Wednesday pleaded with Finance Minister Jaswant Singh and Petroleum Minister Ram Naik for resolving the operatorship row in their favour, on Thursday met Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani.

Chapman, after his 90-minute meeting with Raha, said ""we had interesting, cordial and fruitful dialogue"" and hope to resolve the row soon.

BG, ONGC and Reliance (the third partner) were together losing about Rs 1.5 crore a day by way of unrealised production potential on account of underperformance while the the partners squabble over operatorship.

13,J&K poll results show Cong's increasing popularity: Sonia,"MATHURA: Buoyed over the outcome of Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said it was indicative of the growing confidence of the people in the party.

Interacting with party workers at the first divisional convention of the party in Uttar Pradesh, Sonia merely smiled away a query whether J&K PCC President Ghulam Nabi Azad was set to get a higher post.

During campaigning in J&K polls, the party had projected Azad as the party''s Chief Ministerial candidate.

In the convention, which lasted for four hours, Sonia addressed the workers for only ten minutes and spent rest of the time interacting with partymen to find out ways and means to revive the organisation in the crucial northern state.

Asking partymen in UP to be ready for struggle, she said people were looking upto the Congress with hope and the party should strive to fulfil their aspirations.

Assailing non-Congress leaders from the state, she regretted that their party-run Governments had done precious little for the people who were fed up with their functioning.

Sonia also used the occasion to meet a cross section of eminent people to understand the reasons behind the alienation of the Congress in the state. She drove down here from Delhi as part of her plans to establish contact with grassroot workers.

AICC Treasurer Motilal Vora, who is in-charge of party affairs in UP, party General Secretary Mohsina Kidwai and AICC Secretary Subodh Kant Sahai were also present.

14,Drought-hit farmers to get hybrid vegetable seeds,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana government on Wednesday decided to distribute hybrid vegetable seeds among the drought-hit farmers at highly subsidised rates. Stating this, agriculture minister Jaswinder Singh Sandhu said that Rs 50 lakh had been sanctioned for this purpose. Unprecedented drought conditions prevailed during kharif-2002 which adversely affected the crops, including vegetable production, he added.

Sandhu said 41.25 quintals of onion seeds, 175 kg of tomato seeds, 125 kg of cauliflower seeds and 300 kg of peas seeds had been purchased for distribution among the farmers. The seeds had been made available at the sale counters of Haryana State Seeds Development Corporation in all the districts of the state. As many as 5,241 kits of seeds containing onion, peas, cauliflower and tomato seeds had been prepared and each farmers was being given one kit per acre.

The minister emphasised that the seeds at subsidised rates would be provided only to those farmers who had been badly hit by drought. He appealed to farmers to avail of this relief the earliest.

15,Paddy politics is not helping Punjab farmers,"KHANNA: While the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal are engaged in scoring political points over paddy, farmers in the stateâ€™s largest mandi here are a dejected lot as they have not been receiving payments for their produce even after one week selling it.

More than seven lakh tonnes of paddy has been purchasedâ€™â€™ by the official marketing agencies here since procurement commenced on October but their returns have not been forthcoming as yet.

But, there is no turmoil here. For more than 20,000 farmers thronging the mandi, the saving grace has been the â€˜â€˜calculated generosityâ€™â€™ demonstrated by 250-odd â€˜â€˜arhtiyasâ€™â€™. In the face of the governmentâ€™s laxity, they have been making payments on the conditions which would only tax farmers terms of interest on the advance extended made against their accounts.

Farmers have been ferrying their paddy-stacked tractor trolleys from far-flung villages in Jalandhar and Nawanshahr districts, ignoring nearby mandis. Officials here , however, expected the government to release MSP payments in a day or so. If the payment of MSP continues to hang in balance, confusion also persists about disbursement of Rs 20 per quintal bonus announced by Centre and Rs ten per quintal promised by state.

â€˜â€˜There are no indications whatsoever about both the two bonuses,â€™â€™ said Balbir Singh, an arhtiya. While are making a mention of Rs 20 per quintal bonus in the J-forms, but there is not word about per quintal bonus granted by the state government for paddy grown last year,â€™â€™ he added.

This, however, has not generated unrest because private buyers (rice-sheller owners) have been equally active in the mandi. About three lakh quintals were purchased by them at a price which sometimes tended to be wee bit higher than the MSP.

President of the arhtiyasâ€™ association Harbans Singh demanded that the bonus payments be immediately cleared both by the Centre and the state keep the procurement business upbeat. Though the arrivals were tardy this time, he hoped that the end of it the total procurement would be no less than what took place last year. The mandi recorded purchase of 23 lakh quintals of paddy last year, which was the single largest procurement at any mandi in the state.

Expressing satisfaction at the pace and manner which procurement has been going on, Singh sounded optimistic about the entire task being completed smoothly, something that had not been witnessed in the recent past.He said the quality paddy was of high standard.

16,Compensation sought for riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: A non-governmental organisation, Foundation For Civil Liberties (FFCL) has moved the Gujarat High Court seeking justice, compensation, aid and medical treatment for riot victims.

The matter appeared before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice D S Sinha and Justice J M Panchal. The matter is listed for hearing on October 22. Senior counsel Salman Khurshid appeared along with advocate M M Tirmizi and Imtiaz Ahmed.

The petition seeks justice for victims of Gujarat carnage in general and three victims in particular, for the protection of their life and liberty and against the violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 21 and 25 of the Constitution of India.

The petition alleged that in the Gujarat carnage, government functionaries of the state as well as high officials of the police administration were deeply involved. In many incidents, police personnel themselves opened fire on the victims, providing protection to the looters, it claimed.

The three cases that it has pleaded for are of Shah Jahan Ali Shaikh (18) of Vatva, Havriben (35) of Sasan Vav village and Shaikh Shakilabanu.

The petition states that the government of Gujarat, instead of taking preventive measures, allowed bodies of victims of the Sabarmati Express to be brought to the Civil Hospital Sola at Ahmedabad and angry slogans were raised. Thereafter large-scale pre-planned arson, riot and looting took place in the various parts of Gujarat.

It then sought directions asking the state to submit a complete list of the disabled persons and victims of the carnage, provision of proper shelter to the disabled commensurate with their residential and financial losses in the violence, and provision of monthly pension of Rs 5,000 each for sustenance to the victims who had suffered more than 50 per cent disability, Rs 3,000 for more than 25 per cent disability and Rs. 2,000 for more than 5 per cent disability.

Besides these, submissions were made to direct railway ministry and state authorities to provide free passes, free medical help and certificates, plastic surgery in case of burn injuries and artificial limbs at government expense.

17,30 injured in group clash at Chuda,"RAJKOT: Around 30 people were injured in a group clash between Harijan and Satwara communities at Chuda in Surendranagar district on Wednesday night. The clashes continued till Thursday morning.

According to the Surendranagar police control room, the groups attacked each other with sharp weapons and resorted to stone throwing and ransacking of shops.

DSP R Jotangiya has rushed to the spot with additional police force and started a rounding up operation to stop the clashes from spreading. According to Jotangiya, the trouble started over a petty fight between children of the two communities, which later intensified with the elders joining in.

18,J&K polls an eye-opener for BJP: Vaghela,"AHMEDABAD: The verdict pronounced by the Jammu and Kashmir people in the recent assembly elections on Thursday should be an eye-opener for the BJP which has been harping about pseudo-secularism, Congress president Shankersinh Vaghela.

He said that even the constituents of the NDA should have learnt a lesson for supporting its negative policies. Vaghela added that even the Hindu-dominated Jammu segment did not want Hindutva. Delighted about the election results, political spokesman of the Congress Shaktisinh Gohil told newspersons that the people had rejected the ideology of Hindutva of the BJP.

Elaborating on the discussions of the pradesh election committee Gohil said that the basic criteria on selection of candidates was would be their commitment to the party and to the Congress ideology, their honesty, education and their winnability.

Asked about the education qualifications that would decide the candidate, he said, ""sometimes experience can be more talking about the criteria for selection of candidates"".

Present in the meeting were Central observers Pawan Bansal, Suresh Pachauri, Srikant Jena, KK Sharma, Vaghela, Amarsinh Chaudhary and other members of the PEC.

19,Shiv Sena MLA Vinayak Nihman acquitted in rioting case,"PUNE: Judicial magistrate first class S.Y. Bhosale on Tuesday acquitted Shiv Sena MLA Vinayak Nihman and six others of charges of rioting and obstructing a police officer from discharging his duties.

The case dates back to the last municipal elections when former mayor Datta Gaikwad lodged a complaint that Nihmanâ€™s supporters were terrorising his poll workers. A day later, sub-inspector K.V. Bhat arrested four persons for creating trouble at Parihar chowk, Aundh.

On his way back to the police station, Bhat was stopped by a mob of 40 to 50 persons, led by Nihman, for making the arrests.

During the trial, however, the prosecutionâ€™s witnesses, including Gaikwadâ€™s brothers Kailas and Gokul, turned hostile, which led to the acquittal of Nihman and his accomplices.

20,Defence experts slam US foreign policy,"PUNE: Criticising the foreign policy of the US, a group of defence experts from the city have said that the sudden shift in American focus from Afghanistan to Iraq is a long-term plan to control global geo-political equations and oil reserves.

The analysts, all retired defence officials, were talking to reporters on Tuesday after releasing a research paper, called â€˜Terrorism â€” 27 years plus 9/11â€™. The paper has been released by the Indian Initiative for Peace, Arms control and Disarmament (INPAD).

Lt. Gen. Eric Vas, founder-member of the armyâ€™s College of Combat at Mhow, near Indore, said the war on terrorism is a mere rhetoric as incidents of terror before 9/11 were not taken into consideration. â€œAs far as India is concerned, there will be absolutely no meaning to the American rhetoric if terrorism of nearly 27 years before 9/11 is not reviewed in the proper light,â€� Vas said.

He said although theUS did want to finish off Al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden through its massive attack on Afghanistan, the American strategists had economic benefits on top of their minds. The oil reserves in the central Asian republics (formerly USSR) was a major reason behind launching the offensive in Afghanistan, he said.

Maj. Gen. S.C.N. Jatar, another contributor to the research paper, said American strategists have trained their guns on Iraq as part of a long-term policy to capture oil reserves. â€œOne of the main purpose to capture Iraq is to counter-balance the influence of Saudi Arabia in the Organisation of oil producing and exporting countries,â€� he claimed.

Giving statistics, Jatar said Kuwait and Iraq together produce about 208 billion barrels of crude oil, which is almost equal to the output of Saudi Arabia alone. Thus, with a subservient leadership in Iraq, and Kuwait already under its control, the US will have an assured supply of fuel in years to come.

Besides the oil factor, Jatar said the US also wants to pre-empt Saudi Arabiaâ€™s growing tendency to fund Islamic fundamentalists. Although the Saudi government has banned its soil for use of extremist purposes, sympathisers within do continue to fund fanatic groups, he added.

Lt. Gen. Ashok Joshi, who has written on â€˜Whither global war on terrorismâ€™, said the US policy-makers are not ready to deal with the real causes of terrorism, but are satisfied eliminating few terrorists unsuitable to its future plans. â€œThe basic intention of the US administration seems to be to maintain liberal leaders in the Islamic world,â€� he said.

To this extent, Vas also felt that Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf will never be left in the lurch by the American administration as he is a liberal and is strategically placed. The retired army officer felt Musharraf was heading towards creating a modernised society, which will be a far more economically stable country than India. â€œAlthough sounds jocular today, Musharraf can do it with American assistance,â€� he said.

21,Diplomats see polls as a positive step,"NEW DELHI: The jolts to the ruling party in J&K is being seen as a barometer of the credibility of the electoral exercise, and is expected to help India score a major diplomatic victory.

The defeat of the NDA partner has been more effective in establishing the bona fides of the process than repeated protestations of the government, something that is recognised by both the diplomatic community and government officials.

Members of the diplomatic community in Delhi were closely monitoring the results throughout Thursday. In fact, unlike assembly elections in any other state, they were interested in discussing the numbers needed for government formation and the possible repercussions of a change. In the first official reaction to the process, British high commissioner Rob Young said: â€˜â€˜The people of Kashmir have shown they want to follow the path of peace.â€™â€™ He hoped that this would be the first step in a broader process that would bring peace to the region.

He welcomed the successful completion of the elections and praised the efforts of the Election Commission and those who chose to participate in the poll process.

The British high commissionerâ€™s opinion echoed the unofficial comments of a large section of the diplomatic community. While there were no other official comments on Thursday, it was clear from conversations that the process, in its entirety, is being seen as an important step that would have far-reaching consequences for Kashmir and, therefore, the entire region.

Though officials in South Block were loth to declare themselves delighted with the defeat of the National Conference, including Omar Abdullah, they were not reticent in pointing out the obvious positive spin-offs.

22,BJP to protest against power tariff hike,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Denouncing the recent power tariff hike as ""unacceptable"", the BJP unit in Kerala has announced a plan to resort to both legal steps as well as an agitation to press for its withdrawal.

BJP state secretary P.P. Mukundan said here that the government had produced some specious pleas and figures to justify the hike. However, the figures were not from the audit report, nor from any authoritative source.

Electricity Minister Kadavur Sivadasan had not made public the oustanding arrears of the Board. ""Most of the arrears are from the governmental institutions and some powerful private parties. And yet, there was no firm reply to the question about oustanding dues"".

Mukundan said if the previous Left Front Government had implemented the Electricity Regulatory Committee as many states did, the state would have received Rs 60 crore from the Centre. ""The present hike which, in all, will bring just Rs 35 crore, will only impose a heavy burden on the common man"", he added.

He also accused the Antony government of highhandedness on the issue. The all-party meeting convened by the state recently was presented with many alternatives, but the government had considered none. ""The government had promised the meeting would be convened again. And suddenly it hoisted another tariff increase on people"", he said.
