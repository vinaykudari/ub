2,Trial of strength for coalition in Council polls,"LUCKNOW: The BSP-BJP coalition government will face yet another trial of strength on January 27 when UP Council polls for 12 vacant seats are held.

The number of seats the ruling combine win would not only cement their claim for the majority in the UP Assembly but also help the government to thwart any attempt by a united opposition in bringing a no-trust motion during the forthcoming budget session of the assembly.

Even though the BJP is all set to lose two seats, it has realised the importance of the polls in the wake of Samajwadi Party and Congress coming closer to pull down the coalition government. Party high command held closed-door meeting with senior state leaders in Delhi on Thursday to chalk out a strategy and decide names.

Twelve members of the UP Council, including five from the BJP, three from the Samajwadi Party, two from the BSP and one each from the CPI and the Congress, are retiring on January 30. The Congress seat had fallen vacant following death of Sarvasakti Singh while Sukhdeo Rajbhar of the BSP, who is Parliamentary affairs minister in the Mayawati Cabinet, became member of the UP Assembly.

Going by the electoral college, about 31 votes are required for winning a seat by any political party. As per their strength, the Samajwadi Party, having 142 members in the assembly, could comfortably win four seats, BJP and BSP could manage three seats each with strength of 88 and 98 members respectively in the house. The Congress, with only 23 members, will have to manage extra votes to retain the seat while the Left parties are on the mercy of Mulayam Singh Yadav.

After a crucial meeting in Delhi to chalk out council poll strategy, the BJP has cleared two names, including Surendra Nath Awasthi alias Puttu Awasthi and Raj Kumar Tyagi, who is partyâ€™s Western UP incharge. For the third name, the party state president Vinay Katiyar has been authorised to take a decision. Names of Vindhyawasini Kumar, Prof Ramji Singh, Kesho Mehra and Prabha Dwivedi are doing the rounds for the third BJP seat which may also go to the Rashtriya Lok Dal.

Former Congress MLA Awasthi had vacated the Haidergarh seat for the former chief minister Rajnath Singh. He was promised a Rajya Sabha berth in lieu. But since then he was kept in waiting. Names of BSP minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui (BSP), leader of opposition in the council Ahmed Hasan and Ram Karan Yadav (both SP) are almost cleared. The process for filing of nomination papers would begin from Friday and the last date is January 17.

3,"Panchayat phones in more villages soon, says minister","PATNA: The Union junior minister for communications and information technology, Sanjay Paswan, said here on Wednesday that the Central government has been endeavouring to create communication infrastructure that can provide services for a long span of time. He said this while inaugurating a modern main exchange of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) at Patel Nagar in Patna.

This new technology exchange has been created with this view in mind, he said. This new EWSD main exchange has started with a capacity of 12,000 lines and it can be extended upto 2.5 lakh lines. This exchange, supplied by Siemens and installed by BSNL engineers, has the capacity to accommodate 60,000 trunk circuits. It has all the modern facilities like ISDN, video conferencing and data transfer, among others. A small exchange, termed remote sensing unit (RSU), which provides 2,000 telephone lines in the area around Rajendra Path and Exhibition Road, was also parented to the new main exchange at Patel Nagar with formal inauguration by the Union minister.

The minister said the Central government has been liberal in extending telecommunication network in Bihar with this state achieving many firsts. The Bihar telecom circle of BSNL is among those circles which are providing village panchayat telephones (VPTs) in large numbers. More than a hundred more villages would be provided VPTs soon, he said, adding that the VPT villages are covered by about 160 postmen who carry mobile phones provided by the BSNL for communication needs of the rural people. Paswan said only the BSNL has been shouldering the social responsibility of providing telecom network to all the people, including those in rural areas.

He said that education, health and communication are important inputs for development. Giving tips to BSNL officials and staff for good performance, Paswan coined the abbreviation ABCDEF (Accurate; Billing problem free; Clarity, Distance shrinking for telecom facilities; Economical and Fault-free service). Patna (west) MLA Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha presided over the inaugural function which was attended, among others, by BSNL CGM A K Sinha and Patna telephones PGM S K Srivastava. Meanwhile, to spread the WLL services in Patna town, the Patna telephones has plans to create base transmission system (BTS) at Khagaul, Pataliputra, Anisabad, Ramkrishna Nagar, Patna city, Danapur, Bahadurpur, Shershah Road, Khajpura, Katra and Sabalpur, according to a BSNL release. Work is also in progress to create optical fibre (OF) cable rings with digital loop carrier systems for giving local telephone connections/data/ speech circuits. This will reduce the number of faults and improve the quality of service.

4,Marandi criticised for not holding panchayat polls,"HAZARIBAG: Leader of the RJD Legislature Party in the Jharkhand assembly Girinath Singh has severely criticised chief minister Babulal Marandi for not holding the state panchayat elections which have been pending for quite some time. While addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Singh said that the governmentâ€™s dilly-dallying attitude on this count has resulted into the state being denied of Central funds meant for rural development. Singh pooh-poohed Marandiâ€™s claim time and again to hold panchayat elections shortly for the all-round development of the state.

He said that the chief minister is not holding the panchayat elections since he has no guts to face the electorate due to his faulty reservation policy that bars non-tribals of Lohardagga, Latehar, Simdega, Dumka, Gumla and West Singhbhum from contesting the polls as all the posts have been reserved for tribals. The RJD leader held the state governmentâ€™s decision on this count as wrong and demanded that the state should review the policy on panchayat elections and rectify it at the earliest before holding the panchayat elections for the benefit of the masses. Singh also expressed concern over non-filling up of vacant posts in the state police and the Jharkhand Armed Police for which the state government has already purchased uniforms, arms and ammunition.

He also alleged that the arms and ammunition purchased by the Jharkhand government are below quality and only recently when the MCC extremists attacked the police force in the Chaibasa district some SLRs did not function due to which the MCC Naxalites killed 20 police personnel and looted arms.

Singh called for an inquiry under the leadership of experts of the defence ministry to ascertain if the arms and ammunition purchased by the Jharkhand government could be used in tackling MCC activists. He said that the growing unemployment and the state governmentâ€™s failure to fulfil the desire of lakhs of educated youths in Jharkhand has defeated the very purpose of creating a separate Jharkhand state. The RJD leader alleged that the NDA government in Jharkhand has no will power to control crime which is increasing day by day due to disappointment among the youths who are deprived of jobs despite the tall claims made by the Marandi government. Singh said that unemployment was one of the major factors responsible for the rising extremist activities in the state. He said that the state government has not initiated adequate measures for bringing the disillusioned youths into the mainstream of the society.

He said that although the opposition party legislators raised the issue on the floor of the assembly several times, the government has taken no measure to fulfil its promises. In reply to a query, Singh expressed grave concern over the prevailing corruption and bungling detected in the land acquisition office at Hazaribag. The bungling was detected while settling the payments of compensation for linking Hazaribag with the railway line. He said that although the CBI caught some accused persons red-handed by laying a trap on December 14 and also conducted several raids, the real culprits remain to be arrested. Singh said that even though the Hazaribag district has been accorded the status of a VVIP district, development works have come to a grinding halt in the district due to absence of the civil surgeon, the deputy development commissioner and the district superintendent of education.

Besides, more than 100 posts of doctors in the district are lying vacant which has affected the functioning of the health department. He demanded immediate filling up of the various vacant posts.

5,No place for coercion in population policy: Shotgun,"NEW DELHI: Union health minister Shatrughan Sinha on Thursday reiterated that coercion has no place in the National Population Policy.

""The validity and sanction of any policy or legislation has to be rooted in the gamut of human rights it seeks to protect or promote. The family welfare programme in India is voluntary and promotive in nature,"" he said while inaugurating a two-day colloquium on population policy.

Sinha, who kept everyone waiting for half an hour, came down heavily on states having a coercive population policy. Sinha said the national policy does not provide for any individual incentives or disincentives since these tend to hit the poor the hardest.

He also called for upholding the right to privacy and confidentiality of the woman, the right of a woman to decide when and how many children she will have, right to information and prior consent for the treatment proposed and the right to be medically examined in a dignified and responsible manner.

Sinha also criticised medical practitioners for misusing technology for sex determination tests. It is also wrong that this practice is clothed by an argument that a woman has the right to choose the sex of a child. ""No woman, given a choice, would want to abort a female foetus willingly,"" Sinha said.

NHRC chairperson Justice J S Verma called for a rights based dialogue on the implementation of the National Population Policy without any delay. Verma said that a linkage between human development and human rights has been established.

The population policy must be consistent with and must promote both. He called for a review of the population policies of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Haryana.

6,Govt eases overseas investment norms,"NEW DELHI: In the first ""big ticket"" measures towards full capital account convertibility, the government on Friday announced that mutual funds could invest abroad up to $1 billion in listed companies.

Announcing about a dozen such big-ticket measures, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh said the government removed the existing limit of $20,000 remittance under the Employees Stock Option scheme.

""Such announcements are directed towards higher productivity and higher growth converting India''s potential into a global dynamo"", Singh told the first Bharatiya Pravasi Convention being attended by 2000 delegates of Indian diaspora.

Another significant measure was to permit the Indian companies to retain entire ADR and GDR proceeds abroad for future foreign exchange requirement. At present the limit is $10,000.

The government has been emboldened to take these measures in the face of mounting foreign exchange reserves, now put at over $70 billion, Singh said.

He said the limits on trade related loans and advances by export earners and foreign currency account holders would be discontinued. However, transactions would continue to be reportable to the Reserve Bank as at present.

Elaborating the measures, Finance Secretary S Narayanan later told reporters that corporates would now be permitted to acquire immovable property overseas for their business and staff residential purposes. This permission has been given only to those corporates which have set up branches and offices abroad.

Listed Indian companies have also been allowed to invest abroad in recognised overseas stock exchanges but would have to have at least 10 per cent shareholding in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange in India on January 1 of that particular year of investment.

Such investments should, however, not exceed 25 per cent of the Indian company''s net worth as on the date of the last audited balance sheet, he said.

Though the mutual funds are permitted to invest abroad in listed companies up to one billion dollars, they should have at least 10 per cent shareholding listed on a recognised stock exchange in India of the year of investment.

Apart from companies, the finance minister said individuals are also being permitted to invest abroad in companies which are listed on overseas stock exchanges and which have at least 10 per cent shareholding in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange in India on January 1 of the year of investment.

However, some investment limits are being fixed for individuals which will be announced shortly, he said.

These measures come at a time when the rupee is gaining in value against the dollar in the face of the country''s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and the exporters wanting government to take steps to ensure that the rupee did not appreciate making them lose export competitiveness.

Singh said these were only the beginning of the series of measures that he would be announcing now on till the budget to pump-prime the economy and encourage investments to push up growth.

Jaswant Singh said, interestingly, Indians carved out a niche for themselves in information technology even before the government had not stepped in.

Singh invited overseas Indians to take advantage of the favourable investment climate in India and participate in its development process.

9,Left parties to organise anti-govt rallies,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As part of its decision to launch a stir against the UDF government''s ""wrong"" policies, the CPI-M-led Left Democratic Front in Kerala would organise five zonal rallies in the state from January 17 to unite the people and to highlight the ""failures"" of the government.

Talking to reporters here on Friday, LDF convener Paloly Muhammedkutty termed as ""total failure"" the 19-month rule of the Congress-led UDF government and said it had ""imposed burden on the common man with its measures.""

None of the promises, welfare schemes, and packages for the traditional sectors were fulfilled and implemented, he alleged.

Government did not initiate a single programme beneficial to the common men and ""only infringed on the rights and benefits"" enjoyed by the working class, he said adding, nearly 45 lakhs of workers were in a ""desperate"" situation.

On the law and order front, the government was adopting ""double standards"", he alleged. ""On the one hand people''s agitations were suppressed using police force and on the other police remained passive spectators to the activities of communal forces,"" he said.

Rallies would be held from January 17 for a week and the LDF meeting on January 31 would finalise the further course of the agitation against the government.

11,Government eases overseas investment norms,"NEW DELHI: A foreign exchange-rich and outward-looking confident India on Friday allowed resident Indian individuals, companies and mutual funds to invest in stocks abroad and permitted non-residents to take away up to $ 1 million from sale of properties and other assets they may own in India.

Clearly by design to send out a global message that Indiaâ€™s economy is growing strong, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh announced the relaxations in the current foreign exchange rules which place restrictions on Indians carrying out capital transactions, investing in stocks or real estate abroad.

Essentially what Singh announced will enable individual resident Indian, Indian companies and mutual funds to buy shares in companies which are listed on recognised overseas stock exchanges like those of London, New York or Nasdaq.

There is no limit on the amount you can invest if you are a resident Indian, but you can only invest in stocks of a company which holds at least 10 per cent of the equity of a company that is listed on an Indian stock exchange.

This complicated formulation means that you can buy stocks of over 200 bluechip overseas companies such as Unilever, BAT and Pfizer, which are listed in reputed overseas exchanges and have each got over 10 per cent holding in listed Indian companies Hind Lever, ITC and Pfizer India, respectively.

Unlike for individuals, all Indian mutual funds can invest up to a total of $ 1 billion and Indian companies can invest up to an amount not exceeding a quarter of their net worth. At present, Indian mutual funds are allowed to invest only in debt instruments on overseas exchanges.

Indian corporates, which have an overseas presence by way of branches and offices, will be allowed to acquire immovable property overseas for business or staff residential purposes.

Corporate India will have greater freedom in some other capital transactions. The existing limit of $ 20,000 for remittance under employeesâ€™ stock options programme (ESOP) scheme, will be done away with. Indian companies will have the â€œgeneral permissionâ€� to retain proceeds from American depository ratio (ADR) and global depository ratio (GDR) issues for meeting future foreign exchange needs.

The limits on trade-related loans and advances by exporters holding dollar accounts (export earners foreign currency accounts) will be removed. These transactions will, however, continue to be reported to the Reseve Bank of India.

Although the finance minister made the announcement at a forum of Indian Diaspora, most of the capital account relaxations are meant for resident Indians.

Only one of the measures announced by Singh will benefit NRIs: they are now allowed to take away in foreign exchange an amount of up to $ 100,000 from sale of properties or other assets in India; the limit will be enhanced ten times now.
