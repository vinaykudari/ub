1,Marandi says his minister offered bribe,"DUMKA: Former Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi, who had so far refrained from making a scathing attack on the ministers who engineered his ouster, has spoken out.

â€œHave you ever heard of a minister offering bribe to his chief minister?â€� he asks and himself replies, â€œMy revenue and land reforms minister Madhu Singh offered to pay me Rs 50 lakh every year if I made him registration minister.â€�

In an interview to TNN at Dumka, which was represented by Marandi in the Lok Sabha before he became CM, on Sunday, the former CM said the trouble began when bureaucrats refused to follow the diktats of â€œgreedyâ€� ministers. â€œThe ministers wanted their officers to bow to their unjustified demands. How can a sincere officer obey a ministerâ€™s faulty order without consulting the CM?â€� he asked.

The ousted CM showed a bundle of documents to TNN as he spoke about the â€œmisdeedsâ€� of his energy minister, Lalchand Mahto, who led the gang of unhappy ministers. Mahto was energy minister as well as Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited (TVNL) chairman. He finalised an agreement with BHEL for the expansion of a TVNL project at a cost of Rs 2,090 crore. Under the agreement, BHEL is supposed to supply half of the material from its own unit while the rest was supposed to be brought by BHEL from private companies.

â€œMahto struck a deal with some private companies to pay him Rs 40 crore for the supply of material,â€� Marandi said and alleged that Mahto neither put the matter before the TVNL board nor consulted any individual board member about the deal.

Mahto even awarded the consultancy work to a Delhi-based private company without consulting the board members, the former CM said and added, â€œI am told he took a large sum of money for awarding this contract.â€�

Marandi further said that Mahto recruited 25 engineers at TVNL on contract basis and paid each of them Rs 31,000 per month whereas an engineer in regular service is paid half the amount. â€œHe even recruited his son and awarded contracts for coal supply to TVNL to his close relatives,â€� he alleged.

The former CM pointed out that the HC passed several strictures against Mahto â€œbut he shamelessly struck to his post and refused to resignâ€�.

â€œI was fed up with these ministers but kept mum and tolerated them because I was heading a coalition government,â€�he said.

2,FJCCI accuses govt of keeping it in dark about VAT,"RANCHI: The Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries on Monday accused the government of keeping it in dark on the modalities of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and threatened to go to ""any extent"" against it.

The chamber, which has extended its support to a two-day All India Trade bandh from March 31 called by trade organisations from 17 states, would intensify its agitation unless the government withdrew its decision, the President of the chamber G L Ajmani told a press conference here.

A meeting representing 26-member trade bodies of the chamber was convened tomorrow to finalise the modalities of their agitational programme, he said.

The government should have appraised the chamber of the various provisions of the law and created an awareness among businessmen before going ahead with its decision to implement it, Ajmani said.

""The government has overlooked us before taking the decision to implement the draconian law from April 1 next"", he said and added that the body would support all the organisation opposing VAT.

The Druggist and Chemist Association has also called a bandh on March 25 and decided to stop purchasing medicines from April 1 in protest against the implementation of VAT.

8,Oil rebounds but govt calm,"NEW DELHI: Government officials on Monday played down the rebound in global crude oil prices which rose as hopes of an early end to the Iraq war receded and disruption in production in Nigeria owing to ethnic strife.

""We were expecting the rebound and there''s nothing to worry about as our tanks are full and oil continues to flow from the Gulf and other sources,"" said an official of IndianOil Corporation, which controls 62 per cent of the domestic market.

US light crude jumped $1.15 to $28.06 a barrel, after a 25 per cent fall in the previous week. London''s Brent crude by was up $1.25 at $25.62 a barrel. Oil had lost about 30 per cent value over the last week from its high of $40 a barrel in February.

The prices were also propped up by a loss of about 570,000 bpd (barrels per day), or 29 per cent, of Nigerian output after Shell and TotalFinaElf stopped production following escalation of civil strife there.

""We expect the prices to stabilise in the $ 28-30 a barrel range for now. But we are watching the situation,"" the IOC official said.

He said the daily price fluctuation will not have a big impact on the prices as the domestic refiners buy crude on a monthly basis. ""Our monthly bill may come down a little,"" he said.

Consumers too can expect some respite if the price band holds and there is no disruption in any oil-producing country. This is because the current domestic prices were set when global prices were ruling way above $30 a barrel.

However, there is still some gap between domestic and global prices, which has not been passed on to the consumers. Therefore, it will be safe to assume that the government will be loathe to allow prices to increase and would prefer to watch the situation a little more.

Domestic petrol and diesel prices have increased by Rs 5 a litre since January.

The government will also take heart from the fact that OPEC is already pumping three million barrels per day (bpd) extra and Western demand is expected to drop in the second quarter when summer sets in. This is expected to take care of the two million bpd supply shortfall from Iraq.

Iraq was ranked seventh among crude exporters before the war, exporting about 1.8 million bpd, under UN supervision, from an output of 2.5 million bpd. The southern Rumaila oilfields can pump up to 900,000 bpd.

Besides, Saudi Arabia, the world''s top exporter and a key US ally, is pumping more than one million bpd above its quota of eight million bpd.

But the jury is still out. OPEC secretary-general Alvaro Silva has said members had been authorised to use spare output capacity if necessary. At the same time, an adviser to Iran''s oil ministry, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said any output hike would be a ""violation"" since no decision had been taken to raise OPEC quota limits.
