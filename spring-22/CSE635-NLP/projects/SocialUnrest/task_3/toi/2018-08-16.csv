1,Indians in US using sex selection procedures,"new york: taking advantage of some indian immigrant families' preference for male child, some medical clinics in the us are offering sex selection procedures, a media report said today. one of the clinics even offers to determine the sex of the foetus within five weeks of pregnancy which, many other experts say, might not be possible, a newspaper report said here today. according to doctors at these clinics in new york city area, immigrants from india and elsewhere in asia are making up a fast-growing part of their clientele, the new york times said. the ethnic groups that are moving in from the asian subcontinent and china have a tradition of wanting boys, dr andrew y silverman, medical director of gender-selection centers in manhattan and white plains, was quoted as saying. the cost for each insemination is 1,000 to 1,500 dollars but dr silverman does not confirm that a woman will conceive. and of those who do conceive, about three out of four will achieve the desired results, he said. ""because such gender-selection methods do not always give the hoped-for results, the possibility exists that a 'desperate' or 'especially determined' woman may abort the foetus if it is not of the gender she wanted,"" he said. dr masood khatamee, executive director of fertility research foundation, said he tried to screen his patients to avoid people who would go to such lengths to get the desired boy or girl. ""if i feel that a couple would be using abortion as a way of making this a 100 per cent technique, i would say no,"" he said. another such clinic urobiologics inc. claims it can determine the sex of the foetus as early as five weeks after conception by testing the pregnant woman's urine, a claim dismissed as implausible by several medical specialists. kuldeep c verma, indian immigrant who owns urobiologics, said he did not know why his clients were in a hurry to have such information or whether they intended to abort a foetus that was not the sex they wanted. ""it is their decision,"" verma was quoted as saying.",new york
2,Basic laws of nature challenged,"new york: a discovery which may challenge fundamental assumptions about the working of the cosmos says that the basic laws of nature as understood today may change as the universe ages. the surprising revelation may even lead to rewriting physics textbooks, the new york times reported. the observations, by an international team of astrophysicists, revealed patterns of light absorption that the team could not explain without assuming a change in a basic constant of nature involving the strength of the attraction between electrically charged particles. the researchers used the world's largest single telescope to study the behaviour of metallic atoms in gas clouds as far away from earth as 12 billion light years, the times reported. if confirmed, the finding could mean that other constants regarded as immutable, like the speed of light, might also have changed over the history of the cosmos, the report said. the work was conducted by scientists in the united states, australia and britain and was led by john k webb of the university of new south wales in sydney, australia. scientists who have examined the paper have not been able to find any obvious flaws. but because the consequences for science would be so far-reaching and the differences from the expected measurements are so subtle, many scientists, the paper said, are expressing scepticism that the discovery will stand the test of time, and say they will wait for independent evidence before deciding whether the finding is true. on the other hand, the times said the finding would fit with some theorists' new views of the universe, particularly the prediction that previously unknown dimensions might exist in the fabric of space. even scientists on the project have been deliberately cautious in presenting their result. describing the implications of what his team observed, webb said, it's possible that there is a time evolution of the laws of physics. ""if it's correct, it's the result of a lifetime,"" webb added. rocky kolb, an astrophysicist at the fermi national accelerator laboratory who was not involved in the work, was quoted as saying that the finding could not only force revisions in cosmology, the science of how the universe began and later evolved, but also add credence to an unproven theory of physics called string theory, which predicts that extradimensions exist. ""the implication, if it is true, would just be so enormous that it's something people should look at and take seriously,"" kolb said. the magnitude of the change apparently observed by the group is minute, amounting to just 1 part in 100,000 in a number called the fine structure constant over 12 billion years. that constant, also referred to as alpha, is defined in terms of more familiar quantities like the speed of light and the strength of electronic attractions within atoms. but even that small change would rock physics and cosmlogy, said dr sheldon glashow of boston university, who received a nobel prize in physics in 1979.",new york

5,Agarwal suffers setback as loyalist quits party,"lucknow: in a major setback to both up chief minister rajnath singh and loktantrik congress chief naresh agarwal, minister of state for energy vikramjit maurya has resigned from the ministry and from the party and joined the samajwadi party here on thursday. in another development, former bjp mlc and general secretary of up vyapar mandal banwari lal kanchal, who had resigned from the party last week, also joined the samajwadi party. maurya was among the handful of lcp ministers who had stayed loyal to agarwal after his dismissal from the ministry by the chief minister. he said that he had informed the party leader of his move. the chief minister sought to play down the development, saying the parting of ways by a handful of people would have no effect on the electoral fortunes of bjp in the state. ""the departure of a handful of leaders like maurya and banwari lal kanchal will make no difference to the electoral fortunes of bjp,"" singh said. maurya had submitted his resignation from the ministry on wednesday to rajnath singh and his resignation was accepted by governor vishnu kant shastri. striking a confident note, singh said ""even kanchal's departure will have no impact as the business community knows that the bjp is their only well-wisher"". singh claimed that the bjp would bag 225 seats along with its allies in the coming assembly polls. ""even the poll surveys done by different agencies have shown that bjp will emerge as the single largest party,"" he added. welcoming maurya and kanchal into the party, samajwadi party supremo mulayam singh yadav said at a press conference here that this would strengthen the party base in the state and ""brighten"" its electoral fortune in the coming assembly elections. only two days ago, agarwal had appointed maurya the president of the party's youth wing. maurya, who was also general secretary of lcp, had remained loyal to agarwal along with two other ministers - bachcha pathak and vinay pandey - and had not committed his support to the chief minister in writing. agarwal said that maurya had informed him on wednesday about his decision to quit the ministry and the party. soon after his sacking, agarwal had claimed support of six party mlas, but subsequently three of them had lent their support to the chief minister.

7,NHRC probe into Karunanidhi arrest opposed,"new delhi: the full commission of the nhrc witnessed strong arugments over the commission's decision to institute an inquiry into the alleged human rights violation during the arrest of former tamil nadu chief minister m karunanidhi and union ministers murasoli maran and t r baalu. the commission has reserved its ruling. krishnamani, counsel for tamil nadu, made a strong plea that the nhrc should not set up an inquiry into the incident since the state government has already ordered a probe. he quoted section 36 of the protection of human rights act, 1993, according to which the commission shall not inquire into any matter which is pending before a state commission or any other commission. but this was contested by v g pragasam, counsel for karunanidhi, who argued that in this case ""section 36 is not attracted in view of the fact that the `other commission' before which the matter is allegedly pending was constituted after nhrc took cognisance both on a complaint as well as suo motu, of the prima facie violations and called for reports from the state government and functionaries thereof."" the commission had suo moto and on a complaint taken cognisance of the issue on july 2 while the state inquiry was set up nearly a week later. solicitor general harish salve, who came to assist the commission, said that since the nhrc is seized of the matter, no other body can do it. nhrc chairperson justice j s verma has asked the affected parties and the attorney general to respond on the issue.

12,Clinics capitalise on govt hospital's deficiencies,"chandigarh: the government's loss is the private sector's gain. this seems to be the case with the city hospitals as the miserable failure of all the three major government hospitals to provide their patients with important diagnostic techniques like ct scan and ultrasound have spelt a boon for private diagnostic laboratories. the rates in the private laboratories and diagnostic centres are ""exorbitant"" but the queues here have only become longer. especially places where expensive ct scan machines have been installed. the reason is not far to seek - all government hospitals in the city pgi, general hospital and government medical college and hospital sector 32 do not have functional ct scan machines. ""ct scan has become an important diagnostic technique - it is being widely used in almost all cases for one reason or another for proper diagnosis. earlier most of the diagnosis was being done with the aid of x-rays. but with the medical field advancing at such a rapid pace and newer techniques becoming available ct scan's use has become extremely common. it is imperative for a hospital to have it and its absence only compels the patients to go to the private sector,"" says dr r.kumar of gmch. the wide gap between the rates of government hospitals and those being charged in the private sector indicate how the government's failure to provide medical facilities is burning a hole in the common man's pocket. vijay, whose daughter met with an accident and required a ct scan, had to go to a centre in sector 16 for the test while the treatment was going on at gmch. vijay said,""my child's life is of prime importance. for routine tests one has to wait for month's together for the report to be submitted. one naturally does not have the luxury of time in such situations."" waiting period for the reports of magnetic resonance imaging (mri), ct scan, and x-rays, besides other tests like those of thyroid gland is anything between a week's time to eight week's in the pgi. so is the case in getting the test done. in pgi the waiting list for getting ultrasound and mri tests is extending beyond a month's time. rajeshwar thakur, a patient at pgi said,""i came to the institute a month back for treatment of a bone problem. i was asked to get an mri done, and my name has been put in a queue. i have been waiting for the past three weeks and they say it will take another two week's time to get the test done."" vijay like many other patients is in a dilemma as to whether to wait and get the test done at lower rates in pgi or shell out more money and go to the private sector clinics where the services are prompt and efficient. the government medical college and hospital, sector 32 and general hospital, sector 16 had mooted a proposal to install private ct scans in the hospital. however, proposed at least two months back, the plan is still on paper although authorities claim that the ""modalities are being worked out"". commenting on the high rates of tests in the private sector, dr r.singh, a private practitioner says, ""the diagnostic centres have invested crores of rupees in the installation of machines. and it takes a substantial sum to maintain these as well. while the government has failed miserably in this respect in spite of having huge funds with it the private sector has succeeded. naturally the rates will be exorbitant since they have to cover the cost of equipment as well as make a profit.""

13,Shortage of essential medicines inconveniences patients,"vadodara: lack of availability of essential medicines at sir sayajirao general hospital's medical store has led many patients to shift to ahmedabad's civil hospital for further treatment after doctors here advise patients to seek treatment elsewhere, or buy their own medicines. recently, navla parmar 45, was brought to the hospital in critical condition. kanubhai brahmbhatt a city-based social worker said the doctors provided prompt treatment. ""but after he was diagnosed as suffering from abdominal cancer, they asked him to either buy injections on his own, or shift to ahmedabad, where free treatment would be available,"" says brahmbhatt. ""if the government can spend crores on machines and new buildings, why can't it provide medicines for such critically ill patients. if the same medicines and orthopaedic implants are available free of cost in ahmedabad's civil hospital, the same should be available here,"" he says. according to him lack of efficiency and management is leading to such problems, thus, hurting the interests of innumerable patients who come to the hospital. ""ssgh is a big hospital and also has the medical college attached to it. if medicines are not available for needy patients, then the government should not spend on procuring expensive sophisticated machines, rather the funds would be better used to buy life saving drugs instead of machines that do not function anyway,"" he said. brahmbhatt says there have been innumerable cases of patients lying unattended at ssg hospital due to lack of availability of medicines and timely treatment. he said the problem is further accentuated when the hospital is unable to provide emergency x-ray facilities to its patients. ""getting an x-ray done sometimes takes more than two to three days as the hospital is unable to maintain stocks of x-ray plates, films and solutions. ""many patients here come from remote areas in and around gujarat. for these patients prompt treatment is required but due to the irregular operation of the x-ray department they face many problems,"" he says. ""to assist patients and provide a link between them and authorities we are now planning to set up a 24-hour help cell near the casualty ward. patients who are brought in are often not provided prompt treatment,"" says jeevan nagrik samaj trustee and social worker kanubhai brahmbhatt. according to him there have been many cases where patients had to wait for hours before being given treatment. and, in many cases medicines or orthopaedic implants too are not available in the government's medical store.

15,RG Kar nurses protest new bed plan,"kolkata: nurses at the r.g.kar hospital and the superintendent are at loggerheads over a new table each to the emergency department and the 'cold wing.' superintendent dr subir kumar basu claimed that the new tables were supposed to be set up as part of a long-standing plan to cater to more patients. ""however, the nurses claimed that the staff strength was inadequate and they would be unable to handle the extra load,"" basu said. the nurses, on the other hand, claim that under the new system, emergency operations will be conducted on the same table on which aseptic operations are done. this will expose patients to a great risk of infection. they vehemently refuted the superintendent's statement about their protesting the extra load. ""it is a lie. the superintendent has bypassed resolutions passed by two committees which suggested that the problem can be sorted by arranging some of the rooms in a different order. proposals were made to buy a new table as well. but now, the same bed will be used for both aseptic and septic operations. this will pose great threat to the patients,"" a nurse said. the stir, which began on tuesday, continued on thursday. ""we are registered nurses and cannot conform to such unscientific norms. as a protest we will not work in the operation theatre and will ask for duties elsewhere,"" they said. one of the nurses clarified they had not ceased work, only staged a demonstration and were available for any emergenc

16,Trinamul rift over Library Council polls,"kolkata: dissidence in trinamul surfaced once again, this time over the innocuous issue of elections to the state library council. despite nominating two party mlas for the first-ever election to the four-member mla panel, the trinamul decided to boycott the elections. and all this happened not before a number of mlas expressed their dissatisfaction over the party's decision to stay away from voting. trinamul mla paresh pal was clearly in favour of voting. ""nobody from the party told me not to vote,"" he said, before he was restrained by his colleagues. some trinamul state committee office-bearers were also in favour of voting. ""as we have nominees in the panel, we should vote,"" pointed out a senior trinamul mla. trinamul chief mamata banerjee is meeting the mlas on thursday night, ostensibly to ""discuss the political scenario"". but the simmering discontent within the legislature party is likely to figure in the discussion. later, talking to the media, trinamul congress legislature party leader pankaj banerjee said that his party would be boycotting the election in protest against the speaker. he said there was a communication gap in informing the mlas about his party's decision to boycott the voting. this was also the first time that election was being held for the panel comprising among others four mlas. the left front had nominated padmanidhi dhar, ashima choudhury (both cpm), subrata basu (fb) and tapan hore (rsp) for the panel. when negotiation to include opposition members in the panel without election broke down and election seemed imminent, the trinamul nominated biplab roy choudhury and kashinath misra. ""we tried to talk to the front chief whip lakshmi de on this but he was not available,"" said banerjee. he also said that he had spoken to the speaker and who reportedly told him that the front nominees could not be withdrawn to accommodate opposition members because the trinamul had refused to do the same for the cmc's primary school board panel. ""the speaker has brought down the status of the assembly to that of a municipal corporation for narrow political gains, ignoring the state's larger interest. so, we decided to boycott the library council election,"" banerjee explained.

17,"Jats, Rajputs look for bigger political platforms","jodhpur: the uncertain political future that continues to haunt rajputs has forced them to seek innovative political strategies to reestablish their supremacy in rural parts of the state. this may completely change the political scenario of western rajasthan, critics feel. the powerful jat community enjoyed uninterrupted supremacy under the congress rule between 1947 and 1977. on the other hand, rajputs, considered anti-congress, got eminence under the chiefministership of bhairo singh shekhawat. the caste battle between rajputs and jats in marwar heightened under the leadership of late nathuram mirdha and kalyan singh kalvi, the critics say. the jat community, however, shifted its loyalty from the congress, once it went out of power, and since then has increasingly rallied around anti-congress parties. induction of a jat into the central cabinet is an indication that the bjp has accepted the community to its fold. this shows the increasing bargaining power of jats. the new strategy adopted by them is to put forth the demand for a jat chief minister in rajasthan in exchange for their support. while their sympathy for bjp has left rajputs within the bjp high and dry, jat politics within the congress threatens to take a vicious and decisive turn with the leaders towing the jat cause to remain in power. on the other hand, rajput politics is at crossroads. after having lost three consecutive elections in the barmer-jaisalmer sector, the rajputs are now seeking a separate identity. in order to mobilise rajputs, forums like the social justice front and the pratap foundation have been formed in western rajasthan. interestingly, a prayer meeting was organised here by the kshatriya yuvak sangh for the rajput community in the premises of the veeratra temple trust in chotan district. apart from manvender (newly-appointed state secretary of the bjp) and kalvi, the presence of congress state minister dipender singh shekhawat at the prayer meeting has surprised everybody. according to abdul hadi, barmer congress president and jat leader col. sonaram (mp, jailsalmer), shekhawat has set a wrong precedent and chief minister ashok ghelot will have to give reply for his anti-party activities. this development, however, shows that rajputs are now ready to explore new political equations. they are even ready to change their loyalty to the bjp to seek a greater say in the present political scenario. this is not a bad news for the congress, according to the critics. congress has been riddled with interparty rivalry over the supremacy of the jats and their anti-cm stance. while ghelot needs an equally strong lobby to fight the jat dominance, rajputs need to regain their stronghold in state politics. however, according to critics the greatest challenge that the rajputs face today is to be able to end their intercaste rivalry for supremacy and to unite under a strong leadership.
