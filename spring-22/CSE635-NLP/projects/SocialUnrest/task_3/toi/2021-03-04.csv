1,UPCSMF corruption: HC asks govt to act fast,"LUCKNOW: Taking the Allahabad High Court order seriously, the state government has issued directives to speed up vigilance probe against secretary, Central IAS Association VS Pandey and others in connection with corruption in UP Cooperative Spinning Mills Federation (UPCSMF).

On a PIL, the Allahabad High Court had recently passed an order directing the state government to hold an inquiry into corruption allegations in UPCSMF and submit counter-affidavit within three weeks by March 14.

The two-member bench comprising Justice SP Srivastava and Justice Umeshwar Pandey also directed the state government to initiate action on completion of the inquiry.

Then Mayawati government had ordered a vigilance probe into the affairs of the UPCSMF and since then the inquiry was pending. Following the Allahabad High Court order, the Mulayam government has issued fresh directives to speed up the probe and complete the inquiry at the earliest. The petitioner Manoranjan Singh, a journalist, has charged the Central IAS Association VS Pandey, who was then managing director of UPCSMF, and other officers with laundering public funds resulting in heavy losses and lock-out in various federation mills between 1996 and 1999.

The then MD UPCSMF VS Pandey has, however, vehemently denied charges saying that he was ready for probe by any agency. ""These charges are motivated by a section of senior corrupt officers against whom the UP IAS Association had launched a campaign. Twice inquiries were held into these charges but nothing could be found. I am ready to face probe again by any agency, including CBI"" said Pandey saying that he would seek legal remedy too to come out clean again.

On the memorandum of agitated employees of locked-out mills, the then government had set-up a three-member committee to look into UPCSMF affairs. Although the committee, in its report submitted to the state government, had indicted then UPCSMF MD VS Pandey and other officers, but no action was taken till date.

In its report, the committee found that about Rs 55 lakh were collected from unemployed students for textile correspondence course which was neither registered, nor recognised in UP. The annual performance report of the federation for 1998-99 was also tampered with to suppress losses, the report stated.

The inquiry report found that the then UPCSMF management had carried out business transactions with blacklisted firms and splurged on the federation money by making payment of excess telephone bills of over Rs 16 lakh. The inquiry report also raised fingers over purchase of raw material, machines for mills to be closed and suggested a further detailed inquiry to probe financial bungling.

Seeking a CBI probe into corruption, administrative and financial irregularities in UPCSMF between 1996-1999, the petitioner has also sought direction to the state government to submit action taken report on the findings of the three-member committee.

2,Court wants to wipe out obsolete leprosy laws,"KOLKATA: Leprosy can be cured. This has been advertised over and over again in government ads â€“ but no government has bothered to change some of the laws that go against a leprosy patient.

Even today, a leprosy patient is denied the rights other citizens enjoy. He can make no claims to ancestral property, the Life Insurance Corporation wonâ€™t insure his life, a landlord can evict him on the grounds of the disease and his is a fit case for his wife to seek a divorce. And under Election Commission rules, leprosy patients â€“ like imbeciles and idiots â€“ cannot contest.

Recently, a doctor from Gujarat wrote to Gujarat High Court pointing to this anomaly. K.M. Acharya cited legal provisions to show how they come in the way of eradicating the stigma.

Moved by the letter, the court initiated a suo motu PIL and issued notice to the attorney-general of India and advocates-general of all high courts â€“ including Calcutta High Court â€“ to appear during the hearing on March 16.

The PIL deals with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 and the Special Marriage Act 1954 where leprosy is mentioned as incurable and a fit case for judicial separation and divorce.

This is true of the Christian Marriage Act and the Muslim Marriage Act, too. Under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, a leprosy patient is barred from claiming ancestral property on the ground that he has â€œundergone social deathâ€�. The Motor Vehicles Act 1939 does not permit leprosy patients to acquire a driving licence. Employment Rules say leprosy patients should go on long leave.

3,Dog lovers unite to protest KMC 'brutality',"KOLKATA: Dog lovers of the city will file a contempt petition against the Kolkata Municipal Corporation for defying a Calcutta High Court order for compassionate treatment of stray dogs.

They would ask for amendment to chapter 31 of the KMC Act of 1980, according to the guidelines of the Central Animal Birth Control Rules, 2001. The high court order of February 6 stated that â€œit is the responsibility of the municipal authority and they should see to it that less cruelty should be caused to these animals while catching them. There should be proper humane approach in catching these dogs instead of using the cruel methodâ€�.

Despite the order, KMC personnel carried out dogcatching operations in the Goabagan area of north Kolkata on February 21 using tongs. â€œIn no civilised country are dogs caught with tongs. They use lassos. However, the KMC is still using them and making it as painful as possible for the dogs,â€� a dog lover said.

Chapter 31 of the KMC Act, dealing with animals and birds, talk about destroying the dogs, whereas the ABC Rules, 2001, clearly state that they have to be sterilised, vaccinated and rehabilitated in the same area.

Calcutta Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals treasurer Ananda Sarkar said, â€œKMC authorities pick up the stray dogs and after vaccination just release them in Dhapa. This is inhuman.â€� The activists will also challenge member, mayor-incouncil (health) Pradip Ghoshâ€™s decision to debar the CSPCA in wards 1-50 under the KMC.

Ghosh later defended, â€œThe CSPCA was blacklisted because we found its performance unsatisfactory.â€�

5,BJP to field 50 pc new faces for LS polls,"MUMBAI: BJP in Maharashtra would field 50 per cent new faces for the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, state unit chief Gopinath Munde announced here on Wednesday.

BJP, which would contest 26 Lok Sabha seats of the total 48 as part of its seat-sharing arrangement with its ally Shiv Sena, would present 50 per cent new nominees for the polls.

The new faces may be fielded even in those seats the party had won last time, Munde told reporters at party office.

BJP had 13 MPs from the state in the dissolved Lok Sabha.

The party''s list of nominees would be finalised on March 12 and the Central Parliamentary Board was likely to announce names by March 14.

In an effort to widen its base, the Sena-BJP was holding talks with Shetkari Sanghatana and Akhil Bharatiya Maratha Mahasangh, which recently distanced itself from NCP.

Munde said he was holding talks with Sanghatana, which wields considerable influence in Vidarbha and some parts of Maharashtra, on behalf of the saffron combine and hoped that ""talks will be fruitful"".

Sena''s Subhash Desai and BJP''s Vinod Tawde were holding talks with the Mahasangh''s Shashikant Pawar, he said.

Asked about Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde''s claim that Congress-NCP and allies would win 40 seats akin to their performance in 1998 polls, Munde said every election was different and same yardsticks could not be applied now.
