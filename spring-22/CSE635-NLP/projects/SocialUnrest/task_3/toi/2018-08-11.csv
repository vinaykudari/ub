0,Guessing game in a world of political oscillations,"bangalore: strange is the world of politics. yesterday's foes are today's friends, and today's friends are tomorrow's foes. take the case of the main political rivals in karnataka -- the congress, the janata dal (s, u and unattached) and the bjp. they have fought many a bitter battle, encouraged floor crossings and humiliated each other at the hustings. yet, on occasions, two of them would come together to keep the third out, irrespective of the stance that their parent organisations take at the national level. the dal (u) struck an alliance with the bjp to humiliate not only the congress but also the dal(s) in the 1998 parliamentary elections. in 2000, both the dal groups joined hands to defeat the congress in the kagwad assembly byelection. in the same year, the congress engineered defections in the dal(s) to muster support for its candidates in the rajya sabha polls. and last week, the congress and the dal (s) came together to elect dal (unattached) man and former minister b.l.shankar as the chairman of the legislative council, defeating the candidates of the bjp and the dal (u) by a wide margin. shankar himself has jumped from one camp to another in his political career. as a student leader in 1985 he was with the akhila bharatiya vidyarthi parishad, a wing of the bjp. then he joined the janata dal and worked as a minister under ramakrishna hegde in 1987. in 1994, when deve gowda became the cm, he was appointed his political secretary. in 1996 he was elected to parliament from chikmagalur. he was also appointed president of the undivided dal till early 1999, when he fell out with the gowda family and was forced to quit. gowda hated his one-time confidante as he hobnobbed with the j.h.patel camp. and his sons despised him for not allowing them to gatecrash into various committees. when the dal split, he preferred to remain neutral. the same gowda has now lent his party's full support to shankar to become the chairman of the legislative council. does the shankar episode portend new political equations in the state? yes and no. * yes, if in the next assembly elections no party gets a majority, the congress and the jd(s), who consider the bjp as their common enemy, are certain to come together. the jd(u), which has an off-on relationship with the bjp, thanks to being coalition partners at the centre, may also decide to join the cong-jd(s) bandwagon, whether hedge approves of it or not. the unattached ones are in any case tilted towards the congress. this will help the congress form the government with the dal help or vice versa. after all, the congress and the dal are two sides of the same coin. * no, as the dal, though fragmented, feels that it is the only alternative to the congress in the state. like in the 1994 elections, the dal factions may come together during the next elections, with or without the blessings of warhorses gowda and hegde, and take on the ruling congress and bjp. having tasted power, dal members may not like to latch on to another party. the dal house at present presents a pathetic picture. the second rung leaders and members at the grassroots level want to come together. but the two veterans, gowda and hegde, are proving to be the main obstacles. the two are just not able to forget their differences. if unity doesn't come in early, there is every possibility of disgruntled dal men joining either the congress or the bjp. many members, particularly the unattached ones, are believed to have already sent feelers to the congress, and the latter is said to be considering them seriously. in fact, the support lent by the congress to b.l.shankar is a well-planned strategy aimed at this direction. the congress is going strong. as chief minister, krishna's image is fairly good in the eyes of the people. he has the support of the congress high command too. if he can be a little more assertive and aggressive, come down heavily on the lethargic and corrupt among his ministers and bureaucrats, focus more on infrastructural problems and speed up development works, and also look beyond bangalore to eliminate regional imbalances, there is no reason why the congress cannot face the next elections confidently. there will then be no need for the party to seek the support of the dal or any of its factions. but this is a big `if'. the bjp is ruing the day it struck an alliance with the hegde faction of the dal. till then it was slowly but steadily emerging as a force to reckon with in the state. at one time, the bjp leaders were so confident about themselves that they started dreaming of forming the party's first government in the south. but all calculations went haywire. the alliance, struck by the national leadership and thrust on the local unit, did yield results initially. soon, ego problems and mutual suspicions drove the two away from each other. the alliance met with one humiliating defeat after another, till both said enough is enough. now, the bjp will have to pick up the threads from where it had left before the alliance, put its house in order, boost the morale of workers at the grassroots level, and convince the people that it is indeed a good alternative to both the congress and the dal.

14,'Indian labour laws keep away investors',"bangalore: the duration of unemployment for those being laid off in silicon valley is two weeks. that's the kind of statistic charles w. baird would like indians to remember when discussing the issue of labour market reform. the chairman of the department of economics of california state university (hayward), who is on a visit to india to advocate liberalisation of labour laws, notes that the indians who are laid off in the region pretty soon find alternative jobs in areas of manufacturing where it is important, or in finance or in universities (as faculty). ""this shows it's the investment environment that's critical to employment generation. real employment comes from creating employment opportunities, not by forcing foreign investors to remain in a country, or by compelling managements to not retrench or close their units,"" says baird. speaking to the times of india, baird argued that indian labour laws were responsible to a great extent for the country's inability to attract sufficient investment. referring to china's excellent economic performance over the past nearly two decades, baird noted that the country comes out significantly better than india in terms of labour market freedoms. ""the key to productivity and competitiveness is flexibility in labour and other markets. economically relevant knowledge is local, widely dispersed, and it's changing. with globalisation, these changes have become particularly rapid and rapid changes requires rapid adaptation. what's more, people who are best able to decide how to adapt are those on the spot. so we need to put the decision-making authority where the knowledge is,"" baird said. the economist noted that even large corporations in the us were giving decision-making powers in the area of production processes to people on the shop floor. ""there's a lot of decentralisation happening in the private sector. the government should take that as an instruction. the people who are best able to do the adaptations required should be allowed to do it. some say job security is important for people to keep their families going. but i believe that is a very short termist approach.""

16,Development projects suffers due to lack of funds,"lucknow: the `saffron' ties between the up and the union nda government are all set to see a red hue in the near future. the case in point: over 127 developmental projects of 40 important departments that are hanging fire since years in want of central aid. and in what appears to be the first go for a showdown with various ministries in the central government, the state government at instructions of the chief minister rajnath singh has compiled an exhaustive report of how development in up was suffering due to lack of funds. according to highly placed sources, chief secretary a p verma has been asked to take up the matter ""seriously and forcefully"" at the central government level. the bonhomie between the two governments particularly faces the threat of a rough patch since 14 projects that are in limbo pertain to the power sector. the major being rural electrification -- to cover 2565 villages and provide power to 10214 tube wells -- requires rs 260 crores and two schemes of the up power finance corporation (rs 317.76 crores & rs 581.38 crores; only 69.54 crores and rs 91.26 crores received so far). the comprehensive letter being drafted by the up government which is likely to be handed over by the cm to prime minister atal behari vajpayee mentions in particular several cases where ""the apathy of the union government was causing dearly to the state coffers"" -- already in red. two cases are particularly being highlighted. one pertaining to a direction by the then prime minister hd deve gowda during his visit to muzaffarnagar in 1996 (august 9, 1996) wherein he had asked the up government to slash the power tariff to tubewells from rs 50 per horse power per month to rs 40. while central assistance of rs 260 crores was promised then, it has failed to come as yet, result -- huge losses every year. another case which has come in for sharp criticism from the up government is by the state home department which has failed to recover a whopping amount of rs 138.63 crores from the union government for use of the up pac in between 1988-99. a letter (7220/6/po-2-1100(179)/88) had been sent to delhi in march 2000 and again in september but to no avail. the dossier also mentions in great detail the neglect of the health sector in which as many as 7 projects -- national tuberculosis prevention programme, construction of a 500 bed hospital in faizabad and bareilly, release of rs 1 lakh per district under the national cancer prevention programme -- are yet to see the light of the day. also straining the relations is the dilly-dallying by the centre on the long pending demand of a dedicated bandwidth of 2 mbps under a wide area network (wan) in collaboration with the bsnl -- a facility already provided to andhra pradesh. with focus on agriculture in the election year, the government has mentioned about central funding of as many as 12 irrigation projects -- rajghat nahar pariyojana, bansagar, maudaha, jarauli pump canal etc.

18,BSP demands President's rule,"lucknow: bsp vice president mayawati has called for imposition of president's rule in the state. the rajnath ministry, she declared, had lost majority and was now deliberately avoiding proving its strength on the floor of the house. the centre should intervene immediately and order fresh polls in the state immediately, she told the media on saturday. taking a dig at the bjp doublespeak, mayawati said that while chief minister rajnath singh claimed to have sacked energy minister naresh agrawal due to his indiscipline, the party spokesman in delhi cited different reasons for his ouster. agrawal, the delhi spokesman said, was opposed to the bjp's plan of an early poll which apparently did not go down well with the party stalwarts. both these versions, however, were mere hogwash and the reason for the action lay elsewhere, she declared. predicting an early poll in up, the bsp leader declared that sacking agrawal was a part of pre-election gimmickry. the action, she stressed, was a clever bjp ploy to divert attention from the more pressing issues. ""over the last three years, law and order situation in the state has steadily deteriorated and corruption has reached all time high. rajnath has enacted the `sacking drama' to dupe the masses and improve the sagging image of his government. the cm may drop a few more ministers in coming days to promote his clean image,"" she said adding, ""but that will not cut any ice with the masses."" agrawal, she said, was always like that and in past bjp chose to ignore it. the action had been cleverly timed to derive maximum political mileage, she said. with the rift in the ministry, she said, the bjp seemed more like a `mansion built on a frail foundation... the patchwork coalition was frayed and will give way sooner than expected, she added. ridiculing the cm's corruption allegation against agrawal, the firebrand bsp leader said that the former energy minister was as corrupt as his bjp ministerial colleagues. she also took a potshot at governor vishnu kant shastri for blatantly shielding the bjp government. the governor, she declared, was an rss man and would do only what rajnath singh would direct him to do.
