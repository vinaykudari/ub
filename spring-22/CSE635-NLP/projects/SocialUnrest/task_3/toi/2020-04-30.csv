0,CBI arrests ex-judge of Delhi HC,"NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested former high court judge Shamit Mukherjee on Tuesday evening, accusing him of committing offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Earlier in the day various CBI teams raided Mukherjeeâ€™s residence at Zakir Hussain Marg and two premises in Chittranjan Park. They seized two locker keys and several â€˜â€˜incriminating documentsâ€™â€™ from his house.

In the FIR registered against Mukherjee, the CBI has also named sacked DDA vice-chairman Subhash Sharma, his former private secretary Ashok Kapoor, alleged middleman Dharmabir Khattar and Sahara restaurant owner Vinod Khatri.

A CBI officer said the case relates to â€˜â€˜illegal gratificationâ€™â€™, allegedly paid to Mukherjee not to order the removal of encroachments on Aruna Asaf Ali Road. It is claimed that Mukherjee had stayed a lower courtâ€™s order in violation of DDAâ€™s resolution of 1995.

â€˜â€˜Apparently, Aruna Asaf Ali Road had to be widened to 45 metres for which several encroachments had to be demolished. Although the lower court had passed the order to raze the illegal encroachments, Khatri allegedly paid money to Mukherjee through Khattar to put a stop to the demolition order,â€™â€™ a CBI officer alleged.

The CBI had procured search warrants from the court of special judge V K Jain on Monday night. A CBI team went at 11 am to his house on Zakir Hussain Marg, the official residence which he continued to occupy after his resignation as a high court judge on March 31.

During the search, the CBI seized two locker keys. â€˜â€˜The team also went to two of his houses at Chittranjan Park,â€™â€™ a spokesperson said.

1,State govt asked to restore wage parity,"AHMEDABAD: The Union ministry of rural development has directed the state government to restore parity in wages for relief works to be taken up under the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) at the earliest.

The directive came in a statement by Union minister for rural development Ananth Kumar on Wednesday in response to a calling attention motion by Congress MPs, Madhusudan Mistry, Praveen Rashtrapal and PR Dasmunshi, in the Lok Sabha.

The minister said that the Gujarat government had fixed Rs 50 as wages under SGRY, of which Rs 25 would be paid in cash, and 5 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs 5 per kg. In drought-affected districts, the state government was paying Rs 36 in cash and 3 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs 2 per kg. To maintain uniformity, the government had been asked to pay similar wages for SGRY and scarcity relief works, said the minister.

The ministry took up the matter with the state government and a letter was sent to the principal secretary (rural development).

After that, the state government assured the ministry that anomaly in wages would be done away with in 10 days.

2,Vaghela clinches G'nagar for rally; Modi settles for Vadodara,"AHMEDABAD: When Gujarat Congress president Shankersinh Vaghela announced his plans to stage a rally on the foundation day of the state, to lash out at the Narendra Modi government, he was probably not aware of the ruling BJPâ€™s own plans for May 1.

But now, strange as it may seem, the BJP has decided to celebrate â€˜Gujarat Gaurav Divasâ€™ on Thursday in Vadodara, while the Opposition Congress has fixed state capital Gandhinagar as its venue to conduct a â€˜Gujarat Bachaoâ€™ rally.

Why the BJP decided to splurge in such an ostentatious manner on the celebrations of the 43rd anniversary of the state, is still a mystery, and why it chose Vadodara, and not the state capital, is an even bigger mystery.

Congress MP Madhusudan Mistry says, â€œThey would have faced a lot of criticism had they done it at Ahmedabad because it is not even two months since the death of former BJP minister Haren Pandyaâ€�.

And Vaghela believes, â€œThey (the BJP) had to flee Gandhinagar because we had already planned a rally here.â€�

For the Congress, â€œIt will be an opportunity to expose the government, and to energise and re-unite Congress party workers,â€� says Mistry.

Little wonder then that even veteran Congressman and former chief minister Madhavsinh Solanki is enthusiastic about the meet. â€œI would like to attend it,â€� he says.

After the debacle at the assembly elections, this will be the partyâ€™s first major public gathering and a major test of Vaghelaâ€™s popularity. Earlier attempts to consolidate Congressâ€™ position in the state had led to embarrassing showdowns within the party.

â€œBut this time we have decided to have it locally-managed because the issues are local,â€� says party spokesperson Arvind Sanghvi. Party sources hint that the Congress high command may have decided to put to test the strength of the local leaders.

â€œThey are hitting the homes of the very people who gave them two-thirds majority,â€� said Vaghela. And now the extravagant ceremony at Vadodara has only given them more ammo. â€œI cannot understand the logic behind pouring drinking water into Sursagar and floating 43,000 diyas!â€� he remarks.

According to Sanghvi, the Congress had planned its rally over a month back when they were not even aware of the BJPâ€™s plans to hold a rally.

3,Opposition terms rally as a flop,"PATNA: While the RJD leaders claimed that ""BJP Bhagao Desh Bacho Maharailla"" was an unprecedented one, the opposition parties condemned the rally as it ""created terror in the state"".

RJD''s Rajya Sabha member R K Yadav Ravi was so enthusiastic that he issued his statement to the Press about the success of the rally much before the commencement of the rally. In order to please Laloo Prasad Yadav, he described him as a ""symbol of social justice"" having the quality of ""powerful and efficient leadership""'', whose popularity among the masses has been an established fact.

Although the Congress, an ally of the ruling RJD, did not participate in the ""maharailla"", it defended it saying that to organise a peaceful and non-violent rally, agitation and public meeting is the democratic right of every political party. However, BPCC''s chief spokesman Kripanath Pathak said that his party has never supported open display of arms like trishul (trident), lathi and bhala (spears), as they spread feeling of violence which is not the Congress culture.

The leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Sushil Kumar Modi, said that the manner in which his party leader, Satnarain Singh Yadav, was murdered on Wednesday by the RJD activists going to participate in the ""maharailla"" and buses and trains captured by them are the manifestations of ""undeclared reign of terror"" let loose by Laloo. The BJP has given a call for Khagaul bandh on Thursday in protest against the murder of Yadav.

State BJP president Nand Kishore Yadav said that by remaining indoors, keeping business establishments, schools and colleges closed, the people of Patna have shown that they have no faith in Laloo-Rabri administration and his (Lalooji''s) assurances. Party MLA Rameshwar Prasad said that Laloo Prasad Yadav has become a synonym for daman (suppression) and atank (terror)"" which was evident from the ""maharailla"".

Former minister in Rabri Devi cabinet, Shankar Prasad Tekriwal, said that after this ""lathi rally"" a spurt in criminal incidents is bound to happen and the only alternative before the people is to counter it unitedly.

CPI-ML described it as ""political hypocrisy"" and a ""cruel joke"" with the poor people of the state. It was a futile bid by Laloo Prasad to divert attention from the basic issues facing the state.

The state council of the CPI said that this rally has not only created terror among the masses, but also helped the BJP. ""How can such a rally provide succour to the people and drive out BJP''s communalism,"" asked CPI''s state secretary Jalaluddin Ansari.

Samata Party''s legislature party leader Upendra Kushwaha, JD-U state president Shivchandra Jha, Indian Federal Democratic Party, NCP''s general secretary Jagannath Mishra and Shiv Sena described the rally as a total flop, as the turnout of the people was very low.

5,Naidu peeved at helmet rule announcement,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday expressed displeasure over ACP (traffic) D T Nayak''s ''unilateral'' announcement of the helmet rule.

6,"It's a bridge, but rules say it can't be","MANGALORE: Angered by the official delay in the opening of the new Panemangalore bridge across the Netravati river in Bantwal taluk of Mangalore, villagers on Sunday ""unofficially"" inaugurated it by removing blockades put up by the National Highway Authority (NHA).

But, the National Highway Authority is not amused.

It has decided to block the bridge again, by dumping truckloads of mud on either side of the road connecting the bridge.

According to rules, any bridge costing above Rs 5 crore had to be inaugurated by a Central minister, said National Highway Authority chief executive engineer Balakrishna.

Since the bridge was built at a cost of Rs 8.62 crore, it will have to await the formalities for inauguration. The bridge was completed two months ago.

Talks of inaugurating the bridge were held in March, but nothing came of it. The latest postponement was on April 19 as Union transport minister B C Khanduri couldn''t make it due to the truckers'' strike and the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s programme in Jammu and Kashmir.

As Parliament session is on, sources say the bridge is expected to be inaugurated in the third week of May. Home minister L K Advani and Khanduri may attend the function.

The work on the bridge, completed after a gap of eight years, was expedited after the 89-year-old Panemangalore bridge was damaged in May last year. The new bridge has a carriageway of 7.5 mt and allows two-way traffic.

The distance between the BC Road junction and the new bridge road, connecting NH-48, remains the same - at 1.1 km.

The road connecting either side of the bridge costs another Rs 9.33 crore, taking the total cost to Rs 17.95 crore.

The tenders were called in 1992 and Rs 6.62 crore was approved in 1995. The final drawings were approved in 1998.

7,Bofors case politically motivated: Hindujas' counsel,"NEW DELHI: Lawyer Ram Jethmalani on Wednesday defended quashing of the chargesheet against the three Hinduja brothers in the Rs 64-crore Bofors pay-off case saying it was a politically motivated trial as former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi''s name was also involved in it.

Arguing for the Hinduja brothers before a Supreme Court Bench of Justices S Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur, Jethmalani said that its 1997 order for a ""strong"" Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) to supervise the functioning of the CBI had been repeatedly violated by the Centre leading to the filing of a ""frivolous"" case against his clients.

Jethmalani said that this constituted gross contempt of court.

He urged the court not to hear CBI''s appeal against the Delhi High Court order till the Centre rectified its mistakes in this regard. Jethmalani said that the prosecution in the Bofors case was politically motivated as there were allegations of involvement of Rajiv Gandhi.

The HC had quashed the chargesheet against the three Europe-based Hinduja brothers on the ground that CBI had not taken prior approval of the CVC to file the chargesheet as mandated by the apex court in the Vineet Narain case.

Jethmalani said that the apex court envisaged the CVC to be a safeguard against frivolous and politically motivated prosecution and the government committed contempt by creating a CVC which was a ""shadow"" and a ""joke"" of a powerful CVC envisaged by the apex court.

Jethmalani said that though the Hindujas legally received commission of around Rs 14 crore from the Bofors company, it was in no way connected with the gun deal.

In this regard, he cited letters written by the Indian government to the Swiss federal police and their replies. These letters would show that the documents with the investigating agency did not link the payment made to Hindujas to the 155mm Howitzer gun deal, he said.

However, solicitor-general Kirit N Raval said that the apex court judgement was supposed to insulate the CBI from political interference but not to protect accused person in the guise of prior sanction.

The Delhi HC, by quashing the chargesheet against the Hinduja brothers, had misconstrued the apex court''s order leading to insulating the accused from being prosecuted.

The CVC has also filed an appeal challenging the HC order and said it did not accord sanction to the CBI for launching of prosecution though it was kept informed by the agency regarding various cases and the progress made in them.

The hearing in the case will continue on Thursday.

8,Pune mayor rules out water cuts,"PUNE: Mayor Dipti Chaudhari on Wednesday clarified that she has not given consent to the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) to curtail Puneâ€™s water supply quota by 10 per cent.

Speaking to TNN, Chaudhari also disclosed that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not received any communication from the state government asking it to reduce the water supply to Pune city.

â€œIf the PMC receives such a letter, I will organise a meeting of party leaders and civic officers to discuss the issue. Till then, no water cut will be imposed in the city,â€� Chaudhari told TNN.

MKVDC (Khadakwasla wing) executive engineer Arjun Mastud had on Tuesday claimed that a decision to curtail the PMCâ€™s water supply by 10 per cent was taken at a joint meeting of the MKVDC and PMC officials held last week.

He had claimed that municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar and Chaudhari had attended the meeting called by state irrigation minister (MKVDC projects) Ajit Pawar.

During the meeting, MKVDC officials brought to the notice of the PMC officials that the water level in the four dams â€” Khadakwasla, Panshet, Warasgaon and Temghar â€” has gone down and steps need to be taken to use water judiciously.

According to the decision taken at the joint meeting, the state government has issued a letter to the PMC asking it to reduce the water supply, he had said.

When contacted, Chaudhari said she, along with Kumar, had attended a meeting called by guardian minister Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil last week to discuss measures to prevent the spread of the Sars disease. After this meeting, Mohite-Patil held talks with the MKVDC officials about the water situation in Pune district.

â€œI was present for the second meeting too. However, no decision to curtail Puneâ€™s water supply was taken. Also, neither Kumar nor any other PMC officer was present for the second meeting,â€� she said.
