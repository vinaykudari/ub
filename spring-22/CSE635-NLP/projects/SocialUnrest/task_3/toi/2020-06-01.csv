0,PUWJ sends protest letter to Fernandes,"PUNE: The Pune Union of Working Journalists (PUWJ) has sent a letter to defence minister George Fernandes demanding strict action against senior officials who abused and manhandled press photographers and TV cameramen during the National Defence Academy (NDA) passingout parade on Saturday and for defending the action later.

Prakash Bhoite, president of PUWJ, said in the letter that Lt. Gen. B.M. Kapur manhandled and abused press photographers and cameramen despite the latter following all norms and traditions while taking pictures.

While the photographers were doing their jobs decorously, Lt. Gen. Kapurâ€™s behaviour was â€œshocking and unseemlyâ€�. Bhoite pointed out that the subsequent explanation offered by NDA, defending Lt. Gen. Kapurâ€™s action, was equally shocking. The explanation was totally misleading as it tried to put photographers at fault.

â€œThe PUWJ, as a representative union of Pune journalists, strongly condemns the treatment meted out to press photographers by a senior officer and the subsequent defence of the ill treatment,â€� Bhoite remarked and demanded strict action against the officers.

Maj. Gen. I.A. Satur, deputy commandant of NDA, had released a statement later on Saturday â€œdeeply regrettingâ€� the incident, but added that â€œthe parade ground is the sanctum sanctorum of a soldier and any event that appears to violate the sanctity of this temple of discipline is viewed as an intrusion into the holy spaceâ€�.

The statement further said that the senior officer, who reacted sharply to the photographers who were in the process of obtaining the best angle, thereby partially hampering the sword drill of Cadet Adjutant and Presidentâ€™s gold medal winner cadet S.P. Gore, was â€œmerely reacting to his instinct of 40 yearsâ€�.

Whilst regretting the incident, it is also for consideration that the sanctity of the parade ground should always be honoured, the statement said. Journalists and photographers boycotted part of the passing-out parade after Lt.Gen. Kapurâ€™s tantrums.

1,TDP to organise protest at Paragodu site on June 6,"HYDERABAD: In a new twist to the ongoing war of words between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka on the construction of Paragodu project, the Anantapur district Telugu Desam Party leaders have warned that they would enter Karnataka on 6 June and organise a â€œpeaceful protestâ€� against the â€œillegalâ€� construction.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, TDP MP K Srinivasulu said that TDP leaders from Anantapur, Kurnool and Kadapa along with scores of people would enter Karnataka march to the Paragodu site.He said the protesters would highlight the injustice being done to the people of Anantapur and would remain in Karnataka until the resolution of the dispute.

Srinivasulu accused the Karnataka government of constructing the project in violation of the inter-state agreements of 1892 and 1933. Srinivasulu clarified that the protest was not against the government or the people of Karnataka, but to seek details on the construction as it would adversely affect 750 villages in Anantapur. He said that the TDP would conduct emergency district party meet on Monday, and mandal-level meetings on June 4 to discuss the issue, adding that the purpose of the protest was to â€œpressureâ€� the central government, central water commission and the government of Karnataka to halt the project.

Srinivasulu accused the Congress of lacking sincerity in resolving the issue. He said that the construction of the project would directly affect the flow of water to the Chitravathi balancing reservoir supplying water to Pulivendula constituency in Kadapa, which is represented by Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy. He said that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had also not reacted to the all-party memorandum on the issue which was submitted to her on a recent visit to Anantapur.

Earlier, Penugonda legislator Paritala Ravindra reiterated that he would retire from politics if the charge that he had bagged the contract for the construction of the project could be proved.

Animal Husbandry minister N Kisttappa, MP B K Parthasarathi, government whip P Raghunath Reddy and former MLA P Keshav were present.

2,Medicos protest against PG course fee hike,"AHMEDABAD: Irate medical students seeking admission to postgraduate courses in NHL Municipal Medical College and BJ Medical College submitted a written representation to the Gujarat University V-C on Saturday, and demanded that no fee hike be permitted in postgraduate courses.

The fee hike in question, has been mooted by NHL as part of its proposal to turn the college into a fully self-financed institute. The proposal is to increase the fee of a postgraduate seat from Rs 15,000 to Rs 3 lakh.

This, however, has been contested by students and the GU on the grounds that the fee hike can only be accepted, if NHL is given a self-financed institute (SFI) status.

""NHL has not been given a SFI status by GU. Neither the college nor the AMC has the authority to hike the fee until its status has been changed according to the GU Act. So, until the GU academic and executive councils gives an SFI status to NHL, demand for a fee hike is untenable and we will object to it,"" said GU V-C A U Patel.

There are about 88 postgraduate degree and 16 diploma seats in NHL, while 90 degree and 42 diploma seats in BJ. The decision of a fee hike will affect students seeking admission to any of the two as the process is centralised with a common merit list.

Meanwhile, students, in their representation, mentioned that according to the High Court order, provisional admission to postgraduate courses could be given to students by May 27, legal wrangles notwithstanding, as according to the GU Act academic session has to begin by June 7 and no student will be admitted to that term beyond this date.

About 12 students, who have already been granted admission on an all-India basis on the old fee structure, are in the danger of losing admission as a result of the fresh controversy; NHL has not been recognised as an SFI by GU, so as per the general resolution issued by health and family welfare department, number MCG-1003-1869-J dated May 28, no government college can charge more that Rs 6,000 per annum as fee.

The students said that as the matter stands now, NHL has threatened to postpone the interviews for, at least, 15 days. ""This will surpass our June 7 deadline to join the postgraduate course and will be forced to waste six months till the new term begins,"" a student said, adding, ""The municipal officials told us that they wanted to hike the fee as the corporation was running into a loss.""

Admission to postgraduate medical courses began on April 5. According, to a HC order, the first provisional merit list was to come out on May 16 and the final list on May 24, with interviews to be conducted on May 27. However, civic authorities brought a stay on the interviews till the matter was resolved.

""The new fee structure for postgraduate courses will be decided by the government and because of this reason the admission process has been postponed,"" said Dr M H Makwana, director (PG) NHL.

Meanwhile, the proposal put forth by NHL to the state government to make all its 150 undergraduate seats self-financed, seems to have been quashed too. A source in the medical education department said that NHL''s request had been turned down.

""The status of the seats remain as it was, with the only difference being in the fee structure. For the 100 free medical seats, the fee will be Rs 6,000 per annum as per the government college slab, while for the 50 self-finance seats, the fee will be Rs 1.15 lakh per annum as per the SFI college slab,"" he said.

Earlier, of the total 150 seats, 100 were free seats and 50 were self-finance seats to be filled up by central admission committee.

Of the 50 payment seats, 23 per cent were NRI-sponsored seats. For the past three years, NHL has been charging Rs 14,950 for a free seat, Rs 1.26 lakh for a payment seat and $15,000 for an NRI seat.

3,Condom-vending units empty since February,"PUNE: The Pune City AIDS Control Society (PCACS), in association with the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), has been propagating the message of safe sex and 100 per cent use of condoms to avoid the spread of HIV/AIDS infection.

Ironically, the 40-odd condom-vending machines installed by the PCACS in the city in 2000 are without condoms since February. Repeated pleas and complaints by citizens and nongovernmental organisations to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the PCACS have had no results.

Pooja Yadav of the Akhil Budhwar Peth Devdasi Sanghatana said the problem has been noticed during the past four months. â€œWe had immediately informed the authorities concerned at the PCACS. However, nothing has changed,â€� Yadav said.

The 40-odd machines were installed at vantage points in the city during 2000-02 to promote safe sex. Every month, approximately 30,000 condoms are dispensed through the machines.

â€œHowever, we have not been able to procure a single condom from any of the nine machines installed in Budhwar Peth since February,â€� complained a commercisl sex worker (CSW).

According to surveys conducted by the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), approximately 50 per cent of CSWs who come to the NARI health clinic for various treatments test HIV positive.

Admitting that all the 46 condom vending machines in the city had no condoms for the past four months, PCACS secretary Dilip Pardeshi said the machines needed to be modified. Pardeshi said the condom machine cartridges were not compatible with the new oblong shaped packaging of Ustad condoms.

â€œThe machines were designed to hold elongated packaging of Sangam condoms. However, a few months ago, the Family Planning Association of India in Mumbai decided to introduce Ustad condoms instead,â€� he said.

Pardeshi said he had already directed the company which had designed the condom vending machine, to make necessary modifications in the machines within a fortnight.

Pardeshi said that according to a survey conducted by the PCACS, the usage of condoms in the Budhwar Peth red light area was 85 per cent.

â€œWe need to have 100 per cent usage or else the situation will become very grave. We will install 11 new condom vending machines in the city within the next month,â€� Pardeshi added.

4,Sushma skips party campaign in city,"KOLKATA: Union health minister Sushma Swaraj declined to campaign for the BJP candidate at the Vidyasagar Assembly constituency in Kolkata on Sunday despite request from the BJP state leadership.

The seat fell vacant following the death of the Left Front chief whip Lakhsmi Dey. The by-election will be held on June 8.

The BJP state leaders,however, maintained that Swaraj refused to attend any poll rally on â€˜ethical ground.â€™ â€œ Since her visit was on official business, she thought it would not be proper to address any political programme,â€™â€™ state BJP secretary Rahul Sinha said. However, BJP insiders pointed out that none of the BJP central leaders had planned to visit Kolkata in connection with the campaign. â€œ As we know that BJP has little chance at the husting, we did not ask any senior leader to come over here,â€™â€™ a senior leader.

The party is more banking on the Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and state BJP chief Tathagata Roy for the campaign. Mamata and her minions though peeved with the BJP central leadership on ministry reshuffle fiasco, campaigned for BJP in last two days.

A Trinamul-BJP joint rally was organised in the constituency on Sunday.

However, Trinamul leaders admitted that they faced hostile party supporters from minority community in the area while trying to â€˜sell BJPâ€� to them. Both Congress and the CPM are also in the fray.

5,Centre checkmates Punjab govt,"CHANDIGARH: After the Punjab government has been consistently defaulting in releasing funds for the modernisation of police, the Centre is believed to be toying with the idea of providing direct assistance to the police, keeping the state government at bay.

The Centre would be either granting the modernisation aid to the state police in kind or would hand over the central funds directly to the police department for utilisation.

So far the central assistance has been coming to the state treasury from where it was misdirected to meet other expenses.

Sources said that the Punjab government has been defaulting on two grounds. One, it has not released even a single penny as a matching grant for the last three years to the funds provided by the Centre for the police modernisation as has been laid down under the central plan.

Two, whatever funds had been sanctioned by the Centre for the purpose, were gobbled by the state government to meet its exigencies depriving the police of its share.

Consequently, the Centre, taking a serious view of it, this time warned the state government that if it did not stop this practice forthwith and release the funds sanctioned by it for the police modernisation, Punjab would be barred from receiving more funds under this head.

As the state did not release funds for modernisation, all proposals prepared after 2000 for upgrading and equipping police with better communication and security facilities went haywire.

Even last year''s Rs 64-crore modernisation plan took off partially because the state remained closefisted when came to releasing its matching share.

By the end of the financial year of 2002-2003, about Rs 80 crore of the central money had been outstanding against the state which was partially released by the state till March 31.

While not a single penny from the matching grant was released by the state government, it released around Rs 60 crore which helped the state police partially recover its position. Of the accumulated central share too, the state is yet to release about Rs 18 crore ,outstanding against it.

Senior police officers feel that like in other states, Punjab police should also have a separate wing to monitor and spearhead the exercise of modernisation.

At present there is no single nodal officer for the purpose, though additional director general of police looks after it as a part of his other duties.

6,Swaraj blasts flaws in state polio campaign,"KOLKATA: State health officialsâ€™ complacency and lackadaisical attitude have come into focus with the number of polio cases in the state rising to 23 in the past four months.

Kicking off the anti-polio campaign here on Sunday, Union health minister Sushma Swaraj stressed that a stronger routine immunisation network was needed in the state to strengthen the polio eradication drive.

â€œReducing the number of programmes from six to two has been a disaster as the number of cases has shot up to 1634 from 268. It was one of those mistakes for which we had to pay a heavy price,â€� she said. â€œOfficials at all levels must work hard. Our main problem is that we had to cover 60 lakh children in these drives.â€� That about 10 per cent children could not be included in the polio eradication campaign network in the state was cause for concern, admitted central family welfare secretary J.V.R Prasad Rao. â€œAlong with covering all these children, stress should be given to higher sanitation standards. This is needed in the state to control the spread of the virus,â€� he said.

â€œField level scrutiny has to be spruced up so that all children can be covered and there no dereliction of duty. It must also be ensured that comprehensive microplanning is implemented at the ground level,â€� he added. The importance of the programme on Sunday was significant as the monsoons are not far away. â€œDuring the monsoon, the disease spreads more rapidly. So a lot will depend on the success of the programme,â€� said Swaraj.

Currently Bengal has 23 polio cases, second only to UPâ€™s 28. The number of cases in Bihar and Rajasthan have dropped to eight and four from 121 and 41 respectively. In 2002, West Bengal had 49 cases but was in third position after UP and Bihar.

â€œWe are trying to ensure all children get the polio dose. We have roped in panchayats to help the programme and spread awareness,â€� said state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra. He announced that 96 clinics would be opened all around the state, which will offer polio drops every Wednesday along with the routine immunisation programme.

Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said special attention needed to be given to South 24 Parganas and Kolkata as people here are believed to migrate more to other parts of the country. â€œFive per cent of the children were not covered last year. Resistance towards the polio eradication campaign is mainly due to lack of awareness and some unethical doctors who misguide people,â€� he said.

The Sunday Times of India had highlighted the case of Magrahat which has the highest density of polio cases in the country.

7,Congmen strive for rally's success,"RANCHI: The Congress rally, scheduled to be held at Daltonganj on June 3, has become an important event for the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee leaders and leaders of its front organisations, including the Jharkhand Pradesh Youth Congress. The rally has been planned to highlight poor performance of the NDA government in the state.

Some senior Congress and Youth Congress leaders told Times News Network that almost all the leaders have decided to forget their differences and work for a grand show at Daltonganj, though Chandrasekhar Dubey, the Congress MLA from Bishrampur, is the main man behind this show.

This, in itself, is surprising, keeping in mind the intra-party bickering that has been the bane of the JPCC in the absence of attention by the All India Congress Committee bosses, said a party source.

Some Delhi-based leaders, like Subodhkant Sahay, flew down to Ranchi and also addressed the press to register their presence, he quipped.

The man to be honoured at the Daltonganj rally would be R K Dhawan, the newly-appointed in-charge of Jharkhand affairs. Dhawan will reach Ranchi on June 2, meet the Congress workers here the same day, and address the Congress men at Shivaji Park, Daltonganj, the next day, said Ajay Rai, a Youth Congress leader.

Dhawanâ€™s maiden visit to the state is keenly awaited as he is likely to come with some solution for the main problem facing the JPCC, that of a regular president. It is significant to note that since December 2001, the JPCC is being led by an acting president, Pradeep Balmuchu.

This explains why the JPCC has lagged behind in taking up peopleâ€™s issues despite the poor show by the NDA government in the state, the senior leader said.

Either Dhawan will come with the name of a regular president, or he will try to gauge the mood of the Congress workers and leaders here and take back the feedback to Sonia Gandhi, he said. The Congress and Youth Congress leaders have undertaken tours of districts to mobilise the cadre and supporters, Rai stated. At Daltonganj, arrangements are being made in such a way that participants do not have to suffer because of intense heat, he said.

8,BJP slams opposition for stand on violence,"RANCHI: The state unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has questioned the credibility of the opposition parties in the state for their utterances and stand on the May 27 violence during the written test held for appointment of primary school teachers in Jharkhand.

The BJP on Saturday questioned the rationale and wisdom behind the clean chit that has been given to the Christian missionaries vis-a-vis violence on May 27, even before any inquiry has been completed.

This reveals the vote bank politics that is being practised by the opposition parties, who are also indulging in negative and anti-development activities, for political gains, the party said.

They have been indulging in such acts right since the formation of Jharkhand, the BJP media in-charge said in Ranchi on Saturday.

The party also attacked the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief, Shibu Soren, for frequently changing his statements. Whatever little credibility he had, has been destroyed by his recent statements, which have been contradictory. His position has become ludicrous, the partyâ€™s media in-charge said.

Right from the MPsâ€™ payoff case till the formation and functioning of the Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council (JAAC), the JMMâ€™s real face has been exposed to the people of the state, the party said. People have understood the double face of the JMM on issues like domicile policy, the party alleged.

It further alleged that parties like the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress and others in the opposition have not been able to digest the state governmentâ€™s efforts to give employment to the people of this state.

Hence, they are creating unjustified and uncalled for obstacles, either in the name of domicile or adivasi Sarnas, or adivasi Hindu, or local. They are raising these issues only to divert peopleâ€™s mind from the development work undertaken by the NDA government in the state, the party said.

9,One killed in violence at Tatanagar station,"JAMSHEDPUR: One person was killed and at least a dozen others including six police personnel were injured in violence that broke out at Tatanagar railway station between auto richkshaw operators of the city and a railway contractor over vehicle parking fee here on Monday afternoon, police sources said.

Police resorted to firing after lathicharge failed to control the warring autorickshaw drivers being led by Jharkhand state president of Samajwadi party, Banna Gupta and the railway contractor, Upendra Singh led rival group, the sources said.

Superintendent of Police Arun Oraon, who visited the spot alongwith the Deputy Commissioner of East Singhbhum district, Nidhi Khare, confirmed one casuality while six police personnel including DSP Rajkumar Lakra were also injured in the violence, sources said.

Five persons including two police personnel were admitted to hospital, sources said, adding that several vehicles were damaged in the violence.

Gupta, who was badly beaten up by the police, had informed the district authorities before hand about the proposed rally to be taken out by the autorickshaw operators of the city led by him on Monday to protest the parking fee being charged by the railway constractor.

10,IRS bribery case: Minister's involvement not ruled out,"NEW DELHI: The CBI on Monday told a court that involvement of former Union minister of state Gingee Ramachandran in the ""cash-for-transfer"" scam could not be ruled out and the agency had collected information suggesting role of two senior finance ministry officials.

Seeking further remand of Ramachandran''s personal secretary A Perumalsamy, CBI counsel A S Cheema told Special Judge V K Jain that ""it cannot be ruled out that the minister himself may be involved"" in the scam.

However, the counsel did not give a definite reply when asked whether the agency had questioned the minister and said ""we are in the process of investigating the case"".

The agency had also collected information suggesting the role of two senior finance ministry officials in the scam, he said without naming them and added that the accused needed to be interrogated about this.

Taking note of the submissions, the court extended Perumalsamy''s police custody till June 5.

CBI has already questioned some senior finance ministry officials in connection with the scam.

""Investigation has revealed some kind of racket operating in the matter of transfer of Income Tax officials,"" Cheema said adding searches carried out on the accused''s premises led to recovery of lists containing names of many officers, who allegedly secured transfer through him.

While some of them had been questioned, certain others still needed to be interrogated, he said.

The CBI has also come across some names from whom the accused had received donations, the counsel added.

11,LDF to launch agitation against govt's education policy,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front Opposition in Kerala on Monday decided to organise an agitation against the ""anti-people"" policies being pursued by the Congress-led United Democratic Front government in the state.

Talking to reporters after a high power committee meeting of the LDF, Front Convener Paloly Muhammedkutty said LDF wanted the government to reconsider its recent move to hike college fees and remove the system of ""reservation"" in admissions in professional colleges.

Government''s move to convert some of the unaided educational institutions to aided ones would lead to corruption, he said, adding the proposed Uniform University Law would infringe on the autonomy of Universities and encourage commercialisation of education.

LDF wanted the government to file an appeal before the Supreme court against the recent high court order banning students'' politics in college campus.

12,Maya's rivals ready for rally,"NEW DELHI: Top leaders of the Congress, Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal and other allies will be on the same platform shortly to project an alternative to the BJP-BSP coalition in UP and demonstrate their new unity.

The venue of the public meeting is yet to be decided.

Responding to Congress president Sonia Gandhi''s announcement of joining hands with the other opposition forces in the state, the SP on Monday said that the smaller parties, Independents and unattached MLAs may ``see future'''' in the new alliance.

``The united opposition is actually a political response to Mayawati''s repressive rule,'''' SP general secretary Amar Singh said.

Out of power despite being the single largest party in the state and at the receiving end of a large number of police cases registered by the Mayawati government, for the SP the alliance offer from the Congress was indeed reassuring.

The SP has, in fact, proposed a poll tie-up with the Congress in next year''s Lok Sabha elections and hinted that it could be extended beyond the borders of UP. ``We want the alliance elsewhere as well but the Congress has to be reasonable,'''' Amar Singh said with a note of caution. ``Our effort shall be to stop the BJP unitedly,'''' he remarked.

Though the SP leadership at the moment sounds ecstatic about the `bonhomie'' with the Congress, such a tie-up is almost certain to spell trouble for it in the long run.

In UP''s complex structure of caste-politics, the growth of the SP has been linked to the decline of the Congress as a political force. In the late 1980s, the SP gained new political ground following a significant shift of the Muslims from the Congress.

The Congress revival in UP is likely to see the return of the Muslims to its fold from the SP. For the time being, however, the united opposition banner will provide an effective platform to counter the Mayawati regime.

13,Court asks for FIR against Rajasthan minister,"JAIPUR: A district court on Monday asked the police to register an FIR against home minister Gulab Singh Shaktawat in connection with the death of his domestic help Badan Lal Rawat.

Rawat allegedly jumped before a running train on May 22.

However, at the time of filing this report, the police was yet to file an FIR in the case. Senior police officials said they were yet to receive any court orders. The incident has created ripples in the political circle with BJP leaders demanding Shaktawatâ€™s resignation.

But, Shaktawat, reportedly, refused to tender his resignation on moral grounds, saying the entire episode was a political conspiracy against him. He pointed out that the state government had already asked for a CBI inquiry into the case.

Leader of Opposition in the Vidhan Sabha Gulab Chand Kataria had earlier said that as the matter relating to the mysterious death of the domestic help was being investigated by the CBI, it was the moral duty of the home minister to tender his resignation to enable a free and fair investigation. He pointed out that the CBI would also have to interrogate Shaktawat.

Chief Judicial Magistrate Ramesh Chandra Sharma ordered the police to register an FIR against the minister on a complaint filed by Rawatâ€™s father Hamaji and brother Roop Lal. They alleged that Rawat was murdered.

They filed a petition in the court on Friday, alleging that the police personnel at the Sodala police station had refused to file an FIR against Shaktawat. They further alleged that his brother was killed at the home ministerâ€™s residence in Civil lines. Hamaji and Roop Lal alleged that the police was not carrying out the investigations properly.

They also submitted that the security guard working at the home ministerâ€™s should also be interrogated in this connection. They added that the guard had been recently dismissed.
