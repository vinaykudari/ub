0,Discrimination in compensation to caste riot victims: Sushil Modi,"PATNA: Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi has accused the state government of discrimination in terms of payment of compensation to the victims of caste and communal riots and terrorist killings on the basis of caste, religion and party affiliations.He was talking to media persons here on Tuesday after returning from Maniyari (Muzaffarpur), Sevnan (Jehanabad) and Nagauli (Patna). At Maniyari, a local mukhiya and a cart-puller were killed by the local police from a short range on the thana campus and both at the Sevnan and Nagauli villages three persons were gunned down by PWG Naxalites during the last 72 hours.He said when the state DGP was boasting of 18 per cent decrease in Naxalite killings in the state before the visiting CRPF DG, Trinath Mishra, the Naxalites were engaged in killing villagers in the rural areas of the state. Modi said that the kin of the victims of Naxalite killings in Nagauli, Rambabu Yadav, Tarakant Yadav and Mahesh Yadav were given cheques of Rs 50,000 each as well as assurance for government jobs to one of the family members. He said this was because the victims belonged to the Yadav community. But that was not the case with the other victims as they did not belong to the preferred caste, he added. The Maniyari victims were not paid compensation because they belonged to the Bhumihar and Kurmi castes and the Sevnan victims were denied the same because they belonged to the Rajput caste, Modi said.Neither RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav nor any state minister paid visit to Maniyari and Sevnan, Modi said. He said that a single judge bench of Aftab Alam had declared a portion of the special home department's circular pertaining to compensations to victims as ultra vires. He said that the judge had found the unlimited compensation power given to the chief minister illegal.Modi demanded formulation of a new compensation policy by the state government. He said that the compensations given during the last 12 years by state government were also doubtful as prior to '87, there was no power to the CM to grant compensation in the earlier special home department circular.The leader of the Opposition said that last year also the family of Muzaffarpur RJD leader Parmeshwar Yadav was paid compensation by the government despite his being an accused in the Thapa murder case. Similarly Bindeshwari Yadav, a mukhiya aspirant from the Mushahri assembly constituency, which was represented by revenue minister Ramai Ram, was paid compensation following his killing during panchayat elections while 200 persons killed during panchayat elections were denied compensation.Ramkripal Yadav was sent with cheques and appointment letters when three minority people were killed in the assembly constituency represented by law minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan. Besides, six persons killed in a bus accident while returning from Ramai Ram-sponsored Dalit Adhikar Rally were also given compensation illegally, said Modi.He announced that a rally would be organised at Muzaffarpur to protest against Maniyari killings and abduction of a jeweller at Muzaffarpur on October 25 and also at Purnia against abduction of the nephew of the BJP MLA from Kasba on October 29. Modi was accompanied by BJP spokesperson Kiran Ghai, party MLAs Janardan Prasad Sigriwal and BJYM national secretary Anil Sharma during his tour and also at the press conference.

2,HCLT net income slides 36% in Q1,"NEW DELHI: HCL Technologies (HCLT) reported a 36 per cent decline in net profit for its first quarter ended September 30, 2002. The company attributed the drop in income to a client rationalisation exercise which led to a reduction of smaller clients.HCLT chief financial officer Arun Duggal said the client rationalisation would continue over the next two quarters, and that may lead to a fall in sales and profit growth during the period. However, he said the benefits of this exercise would be fully realised only by the end of this fiscal, when orders from larger clients are ramped up to compensate for the loss of revenue from smaller clients. For the first quarter of the fiscal, its net income (as per US GAAP) stood at Rs 76.3 crore down from Rs 119.8 crore a year earlier.This also marked a 27 per cent drop, compared to the Rs 104.3 crore profit during the April-June 2002 quarter. Shares of HCL Technologies extended losses on Duggal's warning of lower profit and sales growth in the near term and closed 17.85 per cent lower on the BSE on Tuesday at Rs 174.65. HCLT's gross revenues were, however, up 19 per cent at Rs 442.4 crore during the quarter ended September 2002 as against Rs 372.3 crore in the same period of the previous year. HCLT CEO Shiv Nadar said, ''Our planned strategy to diversify services portfolio is clearly on course.With the continued growth at DSL Software and an impressive first quarter at HCL Jones, I am confident that we will consolidate these gains and optimise the full potential of our investments.'' HCLT added 20 new customers during the quarter, including National Foods Ltd, Australia; GERS Retail Systems, US; besides a leading European automotive company and one of the largest tobacco and food processing companies. ''As part of out client rationalisation programme, 33 clients were dropped, taking the total to 349 clients. The client list includes 43 fortune 500 clients and 64 clients with a run rate in excess of $1 million,'' the company said.In line with Nadar's expectation that the impact of the IT slowdown on HCLT had bottomed out and the company registering a 5.7 per cent growth in its core organic business during the last quarter of the 2001-02 fiscal, Duggal said the healthy performance of the organic software business, with a sequential quarter growth of 2.3 per cent, was due to the growing stability in end-client businesses, increased initiatives towards outsourcing coupled with enhanced sales and marketing efforts. HCLT also added 693 employees on a net basis, taking the total manpower strength to 7,156 during the same quarter.

3,Advani indicates Congress-led govt in J&K,"NEW DELHI: In an indication that a minority Congress-led government could be formed in Jammu and Kashmir soon, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Wednesday said that a party ""reasonably near majority"" could be invited to form the next government in the state.

""In a hung Assembly, when no one has got a majority, anyone coming reasonably near majority, can be called"", he told reporters on board an Indian Air Force aircraft on his way to Ahmedabad from Delhi.

Advani however made it clear that the governor has to decide the issue. ""It all depends on the judgement of the governor,"" he said.

Advani said in such situations, the place of proving majority is not Raj Bhawan but the state Assembly.

His comments assume significance as it came a day after Congress gave clear hints of taking claim to power in J&K without the support of PDP which has taken a strong stand on chief ministership for itself.

The 20-member Congress in a house of 87 also claims support of majority of about 15 independents and 6 other MLAs belonging to Panthers Party and CPM.

Replying to a question, Advani said, it was not an easy task to provide a stable government in the state in view of the ""fragmented Assembly"".

He said, since an election has taken place, a government should also be in place.

The current spell of Governor''s rule has been ""forced"" on the Governor, he said.

He said, whoever forms the new government, there would not be any hitch in tackling the problem of terrorism as it would be dealt jointly by the state and the centre.

4,SP to stake claim if BSP-BJP govt falls: Mulayam,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party (SP) President Mulayam Singh Yadav on Wednesday said his party was ready to provide an alternative if the BSP-BJP coalition government falls and expressed hope that Congress would support them in their fight against BJP.

""We will have to think if this government falls owing to its own inner contradictions,"" Yadav told newspersons here.

Claiming that the BSP-BJP government had been reduced to minority, Yadav urged the Governor, Vishnu Kant Shastri, to dismiss the government.

Revolt by some BJP, independent and RLD MLAs was a clear pointer that this government no longer enjoyed majority, the SP leader said.

Asked whether he expected the Congress to support his party in the formation of a possible alterntive government, he said, ""it is up to them to decide about supporting us. We are fighting the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. We hope better sense will prevail upon the Congress,"" Yadav said.

To another question he said his party was against mid-term assembly elections in case the BSP-BJP coalition government falls.

5,DPF may consider backing Cong-led minority govt,"SRINAGAR: With Congress and PDP agreeing for fresh round of talks to sort out their differences over government formation in Jammu and Kashmir, Democratic People''s Forum comprising six independent and two CPM MLAs on Wednesday indicated it was not averse to supporting a minority government led by the Congress.

""Our group has been committed to working for a coalition government. We have been persuading Congress and PDP for narrowing down their differences on contentious issues,"" Yousuf Tarigami, who heads the forum, told reporters after calling on Governor Girish Chander Saxena along with four MLAs.

""Unfortunately while there seems to be no major hurdle on the issues of common minimum programme, the hurdle seems to be on the leadership of the government only,"" Tarigami said.

To a question whether his forum would support a minority government led by the Congress, Tarigami asked ""is it not wise to replace the Governor''s rule with a popular voice?""

Tarigami was accompanied by three other independent MLAs Ghulam Mohi-ud-Din Sofi, Raman Matto and Hakim Yasin.

On the Governor''s response to the present political stalemate in the state, Tarigami said ""we feel that Saxena feels uncomfortable with the present situation and wants to replace an elected government under the process of the Constitution.

However, Tarigami said that his forum would continue to work for providing a stable government in the state.

His forum is expected to meet once the Congress took a final stand on its future course of action.

6,Gujarat polls dates may be announced soon: Jaitley,"GANDHINAGAR: The BJP on Wednesday hoped that the dates for crucial elections to the 182-member Gujarat Assembly would be announced at the earliest even as it began day-long deliberations to chalk out its election strategy.

""We hope election dates will be announced at the earliest,"" BJP General Secretary and Spokesman Arun Jaitley told reporters here.

Pulling up sleeves for the polls, party top brass including Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, BJP Chief M Venkaiah Naidu, Chief Minister Narendra Modi and senior party leader Ramdas Agarwal are attending the meeting, being presided over by Keshubhai Patel, convenor of the election campaign panel.

BJP sources on Tuesday said that both Advani and Naidu were given ""mandate"" at the recent Mumbai conclave of party central office bearers to work out a foolproof election strategy for Gujarat particularly in view of Congress success in Jammu and Kashmir.

Both Advani and Naidu had earlier favoured projecting Modi as chief minister in the run up to the polls.

7,Jaya slams Sonia for delay in J&K govt formation,"CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, continuing her tirade against the Congress, said Wednesday it was because of Sonia Gandhi''s ''intransigence'' that formation of a popular government in Jammu and Kashmir was getting delayed.

The Congress did not have the required majority to form a government of its own in that state, she told reporters at the secretariat here.

She outrightly rejected the suggestion of her Karnataka counterpart, S M Krishna, for talks on sharing of the Cauvery waters, saying no ''useful purpose'' would be served by such talks.

""There is no meaning in his suggestion that he was ready for talks with Tamil Nadu,"" she said.

Jayalalithaa said holding talks with Karnataka would have no meaning as Krishna continued to defy the directives of both Supreme Court and Cauvery River Authority.

""Moreover, the matter is sub judice. The apex court is likely to give its verdict on the two contempt of court petitions filed against Karnataka by Tamil Nadu government.""

Jayalalithaa said the Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma) had come into operation from Tuesday night and striking employees would be dealt with according to Esma provisions.

The government was not in a position to pay more than four per cent DA to its employees, she said.

""Accepting or refusing it is their problem,"" she said, adding that nearly 94 per cent of the state''s revenue went as salaries and perks to these employees who constitute only two per cent of the state''s population.

""This is total social injustice,"" Jayalalithaa said.

""Under no condition Panthers party will support a PDP chief minister"", its President Bhim Singh said in a communication to Congress President Sonia Gandhi. In case Congress ""surrenders to PDP chief Mufti Mohammad Sayeed"", who resumes talks with Congress high command on government formation in the state on Friday, Panthers party will sit in the opposition, he said.

9,BJP rejects demand for dismissal of UP government,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Wednesday dismissed Samajwadi Party''s claim that the ruling BSP-BJP coalition government in Uttar Pradesh has been reduced to a minority and rejected the demand for its dismissal.

Reacting to SP President Mulayam Singh Yadav''s claim that his party was ready to provide an alternative if the BSP-BJP coalition government fell, BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, ""Though SP and Congress are desperate to form the Government for quite some time, they will not only remain disappointed, but they will be thoroughly exposed.""

He expressed confidence that the coalition would complete its full term and the alliance would grow stronger.

Claiming that the coalition has been reduced to a minority, Yadav earlier in the day urged Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri to dismiss the Government.

Asked to comment on the revolt by some BJP MLAs, Naqvi claimed that the differences had been resolved and there was no major dispute any longer. ""The party leadership is in touch with the dissidents and has warned them of action if they indulged in anti-party activities,"" he said adding that the state party unit has sent a detailed report to BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu.

Sources said the central leadership has asked the state party leadership to keep it posted on the developments in Lucknow.

A Lucknow report, however, said dissident BJP MLAs have decided to go ahead with their proposed meeting to chalk their future course of action, undeterred by the 24-hour deadline given by the state party leadership for ""mending their ways"".

10,Naidu denies Advani favoured Cong-led govt in J&K,"AHMEDABAD: BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu denied reports that Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani has favoured a Congress-led government in Jammu and Kashmir.

Naidu dismissed suggestions that the debacle of BJP in J&K election would have any impact on Gujarat assembly polls.

11,Khonglam puts up a brave front after sacking minister,"SHILLONG: Meghalaya Chief Minister F A Khonglam on Wednesday said the sacking of Finance Minister Scot Lyngdoh of the Meghalaya Democratic Party will not affect the functioning of his ministry.

Talking to the media after a marathon Cabinet meeting, Khonglam said all the constituents of his government, including the MDP, are with him.

In the 60-member House, 56 are with the ruling coalition, which includes the Congress (16 MLAs), United Democratic Party (13), MDP (8), Hill State People''s Democratic Party (2), People''s Democratic Movement (1) and two independents, besides the NCP to which the chief minister belongs.

Khonglam, who has been on the receiving end from his former finance minister for the last couple of days, said accusations levelled against him are baseless.

On the issue of Scot Lyngdoh''s involvement in taking extra interest in the controversial online lottery in the state, the chief minister said though it is a fact that Scot had taken interest but since the Cabinet approved it now it is the responsibility of the Cabinet whatever the consequence.

Meghalaya Power Minister and MDP President Martle Mukhim, who was also present during the media briefing by the CM, however, refused to comment on the issue of his party man being dropped by the CM terming it as his prerogative.

When this correspondent contacted him after the briefing, Mukhim said the party has still not discussed the issue of staying in the coalition government or not but within couple of days they are going to discuss the issue and announce their decision but he however maintained that whatever Scot Lyngdoh has stated was his own point of view and not of his party, thus indicating that it is very unlikely that they will pull out of the government, specially when it will not be affecting the government which has 56 of 60 members. The number of ministers including the CM is 37.

The chief minister also informed that the case of Kolkata Meghalaya House would soon be handed over to the CBI for proper investigation. It may be mentioned that some people had linked Scot Lyngdoh''s name with that deal also and now with his ouster and the blame game starting it is very likely that the case may soon be with the CBI.

The chief minister also indicated that they are in no hurry to go for early elections in the state when he said, ""the elections are still very far"" in reply to a question if he feels any threat to his government and wanted early elections.

12,Army wants better equipment for LoC,"NEW DELHI: The Army wants the acquisition of more advanced ground sensors and other surveillance equipment for installation along the volatile 740-km-long Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.

In addition to chalking out the modalities of the pull-back of troops from the international border with Pakistan, the Army commandersâ€™ conference, currently on in the capital, is also discussing various aspects of the â€˜â€˜operational situationâ€™â€™ along the LoC as well as fresh measures on how to combat militancy in J&K.

At the conference, senior officers favoured continuation of measures to exert pressure along the LoC, even as the troops are â€˜â€˜redeployedâ€™â€™ from the international border.

With Indo-Israel military ties growing at a rapid rate, the Army is now deploying a large number of Israeli electronic sensors and high-altitude â€˜â€˜Searcherâ€™â€™ UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) at the Indo-Pak border.

India is also negotiating with the US for the procurement, either through a â€˜â€˜direct commercial saleâ€™â€™ or â€˜â€˜foreign military saleâ€™â€™, of some surveillance equipment.

Some Army teams have already visited the US to examine the advanced ground sensors, includ- ing infra-red, thermal, seismic, acoustic, magnetic and radar devices, being offered by Washington.

A World Bank team is scheduled to visit the state early next month to take stock of the financial situation of state and sanction aid worth Rs 3,000 crores for water supply and civi development projects.

14,Punjab farmers threaten boycott of ministers,"KHARAR: Hundreds of farmers, under the banner of Punjabi Bharati Kisan Union (Lakhowal), on Wednesday, staged a sit-in strike and blocked the Chandigarh-Ludhiana highway at Morinda, 14 km from here for about two hours as part of the state-wide mass protests against withdrawal of free power to the agriculture sector.

This was the second mass protest and blockade, after the first at Ferozepur on Tuesday in protest against the imposition of power tariff on the farm sector. The daily dharnas and road blockades would continue till November 9 at Sangrur.

The slogan-raising farmers, led by BKU Punjab state president Ajmer Singh Lakhowal, demanded restoration of free power supply to farmers, early clearance of sugarcane arrears totalling Rs 80 crore by cooperative sector sugar mills, withdrawal of four per cent sales tax on fertilisers and pesticides and non-completion of controversial SYL canal in Punjab.

Lakhowal, while protesting against the â€˜â€˜indifferent attitudeâ€™â€™ of Amarinder Singhled Congress government, threatened social boycott and gherao of Punjab ministers, if these genuine demands were not met by November 9, when first phase of the ongoing mass protest concludes at Sangrur. This would be followed by an intensified movement against present government.

Serving an ultimatum to the state government, he said if the recent decision was not rolled back the farmers would stop payment of power bills.

15,SAD(B) gearing up for Oct 28 protest,"BATHINDA: Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) (SAD-B) leaders are mobilising party workers for the October 28 protest, which will be organised at the block level throughout the state.

The statewide protest is against the withdrawal of free power to farmers and the anti-people policies of the Congress government.

SAD(B) leaders are organising meetings of workers in villages, and â€˜â€˜mohallasâ€™â€™ in urban areas, and urging them to put up an impressive show of strength at the dharnas. SAD(B) media in-charge Manpreet Singh Badal said that the dharnas would be peaceful and would expose the mis-governance of the Congress in the state.

Saying that Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh never tired of charging the SAD(B) leaders with favouring the Haryana government on the SYL issue, he added that the state governmentâ€™s decision to release water to Rajasthan would harm the farmersâ€™ interests in the state.

Manpreet said that he was bewildered that the state government was releasing water to Rajasthan when farmers in the state were faced with acute canal water shortage. This decision has exposed the anti-farmer policies of the Congress government, he alleged. The seven-month-long Congress rule was riddled with unkept promises and snatching facilities which had already been provided by the SAD-BJP government, alleged Manpreet.

16,BJYM chief lauds NDA’s draft youth policy,"CHANDIGARH: â€˜â€˜For the first time in the history of free India, National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government is framing a National Youth Policy for the development of this huge human resource.

No other government has ever given a thought in this direction,â€™â€™ said G Kishen Reddy, national president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), while addressing the Chandigarh unit workers at a meeting at the BJP office, on Wednesday.

The draft youth policy, which would be presented before the parliament for discussion in the coming session, would go a long way in charting a new path for the countryâ€™s youth which has not been given any direction from the government since Independence.

The policy will clearly spell out the rights and duties of the countryâ€™s youth, added Reddy. He called on BJYM activists to reach down to the grassroot level of society and spread awareness about the party and its progressive policies among people, particularly youth of the country.

In this regard, Reddy asked the youth wing workers to reach the youth in villages who had become disillusioned and were migrating to cities, adding to the rising population. Reddy also used the meeting as an opportunity to indulge in Congress bashing and blamed the wrong policies of 45 years of Congress party rule for all the problems which the country was facing.

He blamed Congress policies for creating the greatest threat of terrorism in the country and also blamed it for working for the benefit of Pakistan. â€˜â€˜The Congress leaders went about spreading false propaganda that BJP was responsible for the unrest in Gujarat and Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf used the same in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly.â€™â€™

Calling Congress an irresponsible opposition party, Reddy said it always runs away from debate and has been disrupting parliament.

Several BJP leaders, including Satyapal Jain, Yashpal Mahajan, Chandigarh in-charge of BJYM Hartirath Singh, local unit chief Devesh Moudgil and general secretary Navin Kochher were present on the occasion.

Soniaâ€™s leadership questioned

Now that the BJP has intensified its attack on Sonia Gandhi, how could the BJYM chief be left behind. â€˜â€˜Can Congress party explain to the martyrs of the freedom struggle that it cannot find one leader from millions of Indians and is projecting a foreigner as its leader?â€™â€™ said G Kishen Reddy.

Sonia cannot speak a single Indian language, doesnâ€™t know anything about the Indian culture, yet the Congress, which is a party of sycophants, is promoting family rule in the country, he said.

â€˜â€˜BJYM activists should spread this message to each and every house and foil the Congressâ€™ attempt to give the country into â€˜foreign hands,â€™ he told activists at the meeting.
