1,"<font color=red size=-1 style=""text-decoration:none"">SUNDAY SPECIAL</font><br>Retail feels the pinch as buyers back off","mumbai: glory days, well, they'll pass you by. glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye. glory days. bruce springsteen's anthem of the heady eighties epitomises the stark reality that the retail business faces today. without getting lost in a maze of statistics that spell gloom and doom, a quick check shows that the commuter on the harbour line and the scion driving the merc s class are both scurrying for cover. the outcome? tables go abegging in restaurants. department stores wear a deserted look. empty seats are common during night shows. new buildings are still to see the light. what's more, white goods are perpetually on sale. automobile makers are loading their cars to attract buyers. occupancy rates in hotels are predictably down, as is travel. rural demand for fmcg goods is flat. and back in the cities, the few that continue to spend rely more on plastic than wads of cash. as the boss said, ""there is darkness on the edge of town."" entrepreneurs are, in turn, anxious and uncertain about business in this traditionally festive season. ""restaurateurs are complaining about the downturn. i'm getting several offers to take over eateries that are faring poorly,"" says a.d. singh who runs the upscale olive in bandra, among other restaurants. meenakshi agarwal, chief executive of hotel & food service review, says that business is down by at least eight to ten per cent and everyone is downscalingâ€”even udipi clients are migrating to roadside vendors, while higher up the food chain, the trendy value-for-money restaurants are not pulling in the punters either. a less-than-busy maitre d' at an upscale chinese inn at colaba bemoans the fact that the dim sum regulars have disappeared. and what about the high-spending young revellers? top-end lounge athena, which is considered very chi chi, has had some corporate cancellations, but the night-hawks party on. maybe partying is the best revenge. ""companies are postponing events and people are wary. but the alcohol business has not been affected much,"" says ceo & director moshe shek. on to glad rags. fashion seems to have a taken a backseat although some high-profile stores have been launched recently in the major metros. shoppers stop ceo b.s. nagesh says that the chain has witnessed a fall in average spend per customer by about ten per cent. sales are flat and divali may turn out to be pretty dim this year, he adds. pantaloon director rakesh biyani says plastic is the only saviour. ""credit card usage is up hugely and people even use plastic for small purchases. everybody is offering interesting promotions to lure buyers.we've been handing out free watches worth rs 2,000 for purchases above rs 3,100, but the response hasn't been that great,"" he confesses.

2,Jharkhand govt for consensus on amending tenancy laws,"jamshedpur: the babulal marandi regime appears treading cautiously on amending the chotanagpur and the santhal pargana tenancy act and the government is keen on building a consensus on the contentious issue. state industry minister p n singh recently hosted an all-party meeting on the issue that can snowball into a major controversy. both the acts were framed during the colonial rule to ensure adivasis' rights on the land. many political and voluntary groups have voiced their opposition to any bid to dilute the two tenancy laws. legal protection for tribal land, they say, was imperative as the survival of the adivasi population still depends on their land. but, the industry minister argues, the stringent provisions of the tenancy rules may have to be amended to boost industrial growth in the state. we ought to build roads and railway network, if we want industrial development. there has to be land for constructing all this. the political parties agree that land must be available for industrial purpose, singh claims. at the dumka meeting, almost all leaders were of the view that industrial development was essential, he added. the government, however, would first frame a rehabilitation policy before amending the tenancy laws. we are conscious about the fact that industrialisation has contributed to land alienation among the adivasi. the rehabilitation will be worked out for the benefit of the displaced people. but, first there has to be consensus on amending the tenancy laws. the minister said steps have been initiated to set up land banks for industrial purpose in all the districts. the deputy commissioners have to be directed to submit the details of government lands in their districts. the land banks would be registered under the society act. the government also has relaxed the procedure for land clearance for the mining lease. the industry department would now recommend for lease for captive mines. asked about the renewal of tata steel's land lease in jamshedpur, singh said a three-member committee headed by industry director a k singh has been set up to ascertain the actual land requirement of the company. the committee is expected to submit its report at the next meeting of government and tata steel officials at ranchi. the chief minister, singh said, would soon hold a meeting with the heads of the labour, energy, revenue, environment and finance departments to streamline the functioning of all the departments for proper implementation of the industrial policy.

6,A bundle of claws and fur,"new delhi: the delhi zoo hospital is resonating with the playful sounds of three-month-old karan, a royal bengal tiger cub. he is being hand-reared by animal keepers and the zoo veterinarian after its mother, kunti, disowned the litter of three cubs she delivered in july. ``kunti gave birth to one female and two males but disowned them. while the female was dead at birth, the two males ^ karan and arjun ^ were placed in the care of the vet,'' zoo director b s bonal told the times of india. the zoo vet, dr n panneer selvam, said arjun was doing well but one day suddenly started vomiting and had diarrhoea. ``despite our best efforts, he died when he was about a month old,'' he said. not taking any chances with karan, the zoo authorities are keeping him in hospital till the end of this year. his daily diet includes 500 gramme boiled beef, 1 kg chicken and 500 ml milk. for exercise, he is let out in the park in front of the hospital. but no one was complaining about the ravaged banana trees that once stood there for whenever karan is there, he playfully munches the soft wood of those trees. ``after a few months we will keep karan in kunti's cage. they will have each other's company and by then he would be in a position to look after himself,'' bonal said. so, animal lovers can look forward to another attraction in the zoo next year.

8,Delegation lodges protest over KPT terminal,"ahmedabad: a delegation comprising of several trustees of the kandla port trust and representatives of the gujarat and gandhidham chambers of commerce and industry met union minister of state for shipping ved prakash goel on sunday and protested against the clearance of the proposal for allowing p&o ports australia to develop a rs 370-crore container terminal at kandla. the trustees who met the minister, who had come to attend the swearing-in ceremony of narendra modi as chief minister, had voted against the proposal at a meeting of the board of trustees which granted approval to the company. the members said the proposal was against the interests of the port as well as the trade and industry. girish dani, a kpt trustee, told tnn that ""the minister gave us a very patient hearing. he said he would take into considerations the views of the port users."" it may be recalled that the proposal, which had been rejected by the kpt board in august 2000, was brought back before it last month on instructions from the union ministry of surface transport. despite protests from the non-official trustees, who also boycotted a presentation made by the company, the proposal was later accepted with some amendments by 7:9 votes. the delegation feared that the company would impose a high tariff on the use of the container terminal and this would take business away from kandla (to ports like jnpt in mumbai) where the company also operates a container terminal. they said it was surprising that while the contract was on build-operate-transfer basis on a 30-year lease, the company had been allowed to develop the terminal at an existing berth rather than building a new one.

9,Repair of quake-damaged slum quarters flawed,"ahmedabad: even over eight months after the temblor shook the city, the post-quake repair works being carried out in 24 slum colonies across the city is proceeding at a snail's pace. the damaged structures and concrete debris still haunt the 3,500 families living in the slum quarters. ""we are still living under constant fear that some day our building might collapse as the repair work was not done properly,"" complains prahaladbhai solanki, a resident of danilimbda slum quarters. he says the work undertaken by contractors was extremely slow and would take another year for completion. solanki, like many others, was dissatisfied with the kind of work carried out by the private contractors engaged by the ahmedabad municipal corporation (amc). most of the slum quarters were in dilapidated condition before the quake struck and with the impact of the tremor, the buildings have now become a virtual death trap for the residents. ""but nobody is listening to us, besides the repair work is not up to the mark,"" solanki says. he adds that contractors were not at all concerned about repairs in the basic structure and were trying to conceal the cracks visible on the exterior side of the building. ""most of the residents are with the municipal corporation working as grade-iv employees, so nobody was bothered about their problems,"" anjali awate, the project co-ordinator of kamdar swasthya suraksha mandal (kssm), said. sweepers, manhole workers and contract labourers are the main residents of slum quarters where education, information and awareness about the disaster was negligible. the organisation tries to spread information about post-quake repairs through pamphlets, training sessions, periodical meetings and counselling to the affected families _ information about the repair work and the material used. ""most of the repair work carried out was cosmetic one,"" says chandrakant lapsiwala, a resident of gomtipur health staff quarters. according to residents, the repair work was a sham as huge cracks were still visible inside the building. there are lot of other complaints about repair work inside the individual dwelling units, parapet walls besides miscellaneous works to be carried out. there were also allegations about use of sub-standard quality of building material in the repair work. ""we have acted on the complaints brought to the corporation's notice about the use of substandard material,"" badruddin sheikh, the chairman of the amc standing committee, said assuring that action would be taken against specific complaints. ""but why the corporation itself evolves a mechanism to check out the quality of construction material used,"" hosla prasad mishra of the kssm says while arguing about the futility of the exercise, as only the affected people were at the receiving end. the state government released a sum of rs 22 crore for the repair works in schools, hospitals and municipal buildings besides a separate grant of rs 5 crore from the centre for slum quarters.
