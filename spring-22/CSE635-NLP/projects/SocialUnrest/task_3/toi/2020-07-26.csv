0,Sena lines up a party for 'chhote saheb',"MUMBAI: The enthuasism is unmistakable. The rank and file of the Shiv Sena is working overtime to make a grand success of their chhote sahebâ€™s 43rd birthday on Sunday. The message is loud and clearâ€”Shiv Sainiks no longer know Uddhav Thackeray only as their party chief Bal Thackerayâ€™s son.

The near-consensus within the party is that he has politically come of age. â€œHe is no more the shy backroom boy,â€™â€™ said a Sena insider. â€œToday he exudes quiet confidence and displays sharp political acumen.â€™â€™ Ever since Thackeray pere anointed him as his political heir at a conclave of second-rung leaders in Mahabaleshwar a few months ago, Uddhav has emerged as a leader who is widely respected for his capacity for hard work, earnestness and political-management skills.

Bal Thackeray has become a near-recluse, confining himself to his air-conditioned room at his Bandra bungalow and tentatively puffing Havana cigars. He has effectively left Uddhav to lead the organisation, interact with leaders of the BJP and other parties and prepare the party for the next elections, although policy decisions continue to be taken by him.

Recently, Bal Thackeray appointed Suryakant Mahadik and Kiran Pavaskar, two men handpicked by Uddhav, to lead the powerful labour wing of the party, the Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS). The Hind Kisan Kamgar Sena,which earlier was led by Mr Mahadik, was merged with the BKS. This has allowed Uddhav to reinforce his position in the party. The student wing, the Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena (BVS), is the only organisation under the Sena umbrella that Uddhav does not directly control.

The BVS continues to be controlled by Uddhavâ€™s cousin, Raj, whose efforts to occupy the no. 2 slot in the Shiv Sena have met with little success. Meanwhile, Uddhav has systematically been readying the Shiv Sena for the electoral battles that are around the corner. He has made efforts to win over the Dalits, the Dhangars, Matangs and other backward communities. His relationship with key BJP leaders has also improved vastly over the last few months and he is perceived by the BJP leadership as a man with whom they can do honest business. The real challenge before Uddhav now is to put the saffron alliance in the driverâ€™s seat in Maharashtra.

The problem is that the BJP is organisationally not in a comfortable position because of a lacklustre leadership and demotivated cadre. â€œThe overall tally of seats of the alliance will be reduced if the BJP gets fewer seats than in the past,â€™â€™ a Sena office-bearer told TNN, barely concealing his anxiety. The electoral prospects of the Sena-BJP combine will improve vastly if the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party fail to forge a pre-poll alliance.

But, Uddhav is not depending on a division of votes between the Congress and the NCP to propel the Sena-BJP alliance to power. He wants to justify the confidence reposed in him by Bal Thackeray by getting a Sena man elected as the next chief minister. For the moment, Uddhavâ€™s gameplan appears to be on track.

1,Kharge to lead govt delegation to Delhi,"BANGALORE: A Karnataka government delegation, led by home minister M. Mallikarjuna Kharge, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on drought, will meet Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh on July 29 in New Delhi to seek additional assistance for drought relief work.

â€œWe have drawn up a 90-day drought relief plan. In a day or two, we will prepare a memorandum regarding our requirements â€”foodgrains and financial aid â€”and submit it to the Centre,â€™â€™ Kharge told reporters here on Saturday. The Centre will be also urged to increase the allocation of foodgrains to families under below poverty line (BPL). â€œAt present, the Centre has allocated foodgrains for 10 days per month for 22 lakh BPL families. But now, their number has increased to 33 lakh and we want the Centre to increase the allocation correspondingly,â€™â€™ he added.

Kharge, who accused the insurance firms of being discriminatory while clearing crop loss insurance, said the matter would be brought to the notice of the Centre.

â€œIn Andhra Pradesh, insurance officers are distributing insurance amount to farmers at their doorstep. But here, many cases are still pending. In fact, state chief secretary B.S. Patil has been asked to speak to the insurance firms,â€™â€™ he said.

The government had also urged the firms to consult agriculture and revenue officials while clearing crop insurance cases.

2,Naidu hints at early elections,"HYDERABAD: Hinting at a possibility of advancing elections to the Assembly in the event of early polls to the Lok Sabha, chief minister and TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday asked his party cadre to treat the situation like an emergency and ensure victory for the party at the hustings.

The chief minister said the BJPled government at the Centre might advance Lok Sabha elections to either February or May, depending on the outcome of the forthcoming elections to four states in November this year.

â€œIf the Lok Sabha elections are held in February, the state need not go for simultaneous polls. But, if Parliament elections are announced in either April or May,we will be left with no option, but to go in for polls,â€� Naidu announced at the closed-door TDP state executive meeting on Saturday.

Elections to the state Assembly are due in September next year, but the TDP, an important ally of BJP, is awaiting a signal from the Centre in going for the polls. In all likelihood, Telugu Desam Party will continue the electoral alliance with the BJP in the next elections also.

Naidu also said that he had assessed the poll prospects of all the party MLAs and prospective candidates for all the 294 assembly seats. â€œThe persons, including sitting legislators whose prospects of winning are bleak will not be given tickets and the same person, who was denied the ticket, has to suggest a new name,â€� he said.

The TDP president also predicted that the Congress party would split shortly with the Congress Forum for Telangana merging with the TRS before the elections. â€œWe should be careful about the new moves in the Congress party and must ensure its defeat in the elections,â€� he said, adding that TDP would secure majority seats in the Telangana region.

Naidu also asked the party leaders to mix development with politics, as opposition groups are trying to politicise every issue.

â€œI had said in the past that I will not talk about politics, except before elections. It is now proving counter-productive, as the leaders too stopped talking about politics,â€� he said.

3,Alternative energy must for rural development,"LUCKNOW: In Pavo, a small village near Pune, even children know how to operate and repair computers. The village has shot to a position where it can at least visualise a future, even if far-fetched, when they will compete with the Silicon valleys of the world.

Citing the example of Pavo, commissioner rural development, Rita Sinha, said that this was because a scientist went back to his hometown and taught the children to operate and repair computers.

As there was no electricity in the village, the scientist used solar batteries to run the computers. ""What could be a better example of empowerment of the rustic,"" she said.

Addressing participants on the occasion of ''Everlasting energy day'' at Neda, Sinha urged them to adopt use of non-conventional energy rather than complain about shortage of power in the state.

Sinha said that while the power of mind and muscle had been utilised to conquer the world more than once, the need today was to recognise the power of the Sun. And, to ""demystify science"", she said.

The non-conventional sources of energy were environment friendly, but the only hurdle was that people were not aware of the benefits. She advised that commercially viable products should be marketed properly, as, though there were many alternative non-conventional sources available like solar energy and wind energy, yet the use of such forms of energy was not popular. The fact that there were so many products was known only by the government officials who were trying to popularise the non-conventional energy forms, but, she said, what was required was the ''art of selling''.

Secretary, alternative energy sources department, GB Patnaik, urged Neda officials to strive for generating 500 MW electricity through alternative sources in the next five years.

Generating electricity using garbage as raw material could be a viable option, he said, as there was no dearth of waste material in the country. With increase in population, though, each of the non-renewable sources were spent, waste material, however, was increased in the same proportion as the population.

While today the country was moving ahead with information technology, the villages remained untouched by the revolution, he said adding that the main cause was shortage of electricity.

It was a dilemma, he said, as there were certain areas where there was no possibility of electricity to reach. ""We all have to shoulder the responsibility of developing these areas,"" he said adding ""and that was only possible through the alternative sources of energy like solar and other such renewable sources of energy"".

Patnaik said that Lucknow was the first place where a waste-to-energy plant was established, though it was yet to become fully functional. This plant has been set up by the Chennai-based Asia Bio-Energy Limited, in collaboration with the Lucknow Municipal Corporation. Similar plants would also be set up in other cities of the state, he said adding that the process of signing the MOUs for Kaval towns was to be completed soon.

5,Krishna should respect inter-state rules: Naidu,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has resumed his campaign against Karnatakaâ€™s irrigation projects by launching a scathing attack on his counterpart S M Krishna for allegedly violating inter-state agreements and proceeding with the construction of projects on the Upper Tunga.

Addressing the TDP executive meeting on Saturday, the chief minister alleged that Karnataka was using up more than its allotted share of 306 tmc ft from the river Tungabhadra in violation of the Bachawat Tribunal award and other interstate agreements. â€œMr Krishna should respect inter-state rules and ensure that the interests of lower riparian states are met,â€� he said.

Naidu said the projects envisaged by Karnataka in the upper reaches of Tunga would adversely affect Anantapur,Kadapa,Kurnool and Mahabubnagar districts in AP. He charged Karnataka with doing injustice to Andhra Pradesh by trying to store more than 40 tmc ft of excess water in Upper Tunga and 11 other projects.

The chief minister also took a dig at the Congress for failing to convince its high command to prod Krishna to stop these illegal projects. â€œWe are not asking the Congress do a favour to us. We are asking the party fight for the rights of the state,â€� he said. Instead of supporting the state government its fight, the Congress and the other opposition parties were trying to politicise the issue, he said.

â€œWhat did they do for irrigation when they were in power in the state,â€� asked. In contrast with the Congress government â€œlacklustre performanceâ€�, the TDP government created 10 lakh acres of ayacut during its tenure. It was the TDP which strove for the development backward areas. The chief minister, criticised the opposition parties for politicising even the Godavari Pushkarams.

He asked the party activists to create awareness among the people about the welfare schemes initiated by the government for the development of the SCs, STs, BCs and minorities in the state. He also appealed to the TDP-affiliated MPPs, MPTCs and all other local body representatives to take effective steps to control the spread of viral fever their respective regions.

Senior party leaders Umareddy Venkateshwarlu, K Yerrannaidu, home minister T Devender Goud and others were present.

6,Campus violence was politically motivated: V-C,"LUCKNOW: Describing Saturday''s violent incidents on the campus as ''politically motivated'', LU vice-chancellor Prof SB Singh said that the violence was instigated and perpetrated by self-proclaimed student leaders for petty political mileage.

Addressing mediapersons at an impromptu press conference after visiting the violence-hit areas on the campus and listening to the woes of teachers, he said that the university administration would not tolerate any act of indiscipline and danger to the life and property of students, employees and teachers.

The V-C told reporters that student leaders leading the mob to the chancellor''s office in the morning were not students of Lucknow University any more.

He said that all students who would be identified for involvement in the act of rioting would be expelled from the university.

While evading queries on the role of district and police administration on not been able to provide adequate security, after anticipating a violent backlash by students after the morning''s cane-charge, he said that he had asked the district administration to provide adequate security cover to teachers and on the campus.

Fear gripped teachers on the campus after the violence as many refused to work in the ''insecure atmosphere''.

7,High court annuls college principal's appointment,"ARA: In a significant judgment, the Patna High Court recently annulled the concurrence granted by the Bihar College Service Commission to the appointment of Dharamraj Singh as principal of Shershah College under the Veer Kuer Singh University (VKSU).

The court, after several hearings on the writ petition, found that Singh did not have the requisite qualification for appointment as principal of the college and he obtained commission''s concurrence by fraudulent means.

Despite the VKSU administration''s recommendation to the commission for reconsidering the matter, the court observed that it could not be done as the commission did not have appropriate number of members and was also non-functioning.

Since the commission has not been reconstituted, Singh''s illegal appointment made on a teaching experience certificate, found to be forced and fabricated, could not be allowed to continue, the court maintained and directed VKSU VC to appoint the senior-most teacher of the college as professor-in-charge temporarily by following the statutes and rules framed in this regard till the appointment of a new principal in accordance with law.

Incidentally, Singh was earlier transferred to the GB College, Ramgarh (Kaimur), as principal by the VKSU administration to facilitate the inquiry against him by different committees constituted by the university.

Complying with the court orders, VKSU VC ordered Singh to cease the function as college principal and join as a lecturer in the department of physics in the same G B College. The VC also appointed the senior-most college teacher as professor-in-charge. Dharamraj Singh was appointed as a lecturer in the department of physics at Shershah College in August 1975.

He had then produced a certificate showing his teaching experience of two years at Shankar College, Sasaram.

He was made professor-in-charge and later promoted as principal in May 1976 although he did not have the minimum teaching experience for appointment as principal. Separate inquiry committees constituted by the university administration on the court directives found Singh''s experience certificate forged.

10,PM announces another sop for farmers,"NEW DELHI: Listing what his government has done for farmers and promising to look after their interests and get them the right price, Prime Minister Vajpayee on Sunday asked farmers to diversify, reduce costs and ready for global competition.

Addressing farmers who had gathered at his residence to felicitate him for recent announcements such as the reduction in interest rate on crop loans, the PM made one more announcement: The advice that the interest rate on agricultural loans up to Rs 2 lakh should not be more than the prime lending rate. This, he said, should work out to a total benefit of Rs 2,500 crore.

As Cabinet Ministers Rajnath Singh, Sahib Singh and Sharad Yadav looked on, the PM welcomed farmers brought by the BJP Kisan Morcha to his ""kiraye ka makaan (rented house) amid lyrical mention of the weather -- but drove home the lesson on what needs to be done, peppering it all with what his government has done so far.

Many countries in the world need grain for their poor but our costs are much higher than international prices. We need to bridge this gap and lower costs. Recommending the formation of monitoring committees to ensure farmers do benefit from the lower interest rate regime, he urged them to go in for credit cards on a bigger scale. More than three crore farmers already have.

Describing farmers as a priority for the government, Vajpayee asked them to change their farming styles, diversify into horticulture, grow the pulses and oilseeds the country still needs and dwelt on the problems of storage and distribution. There is, globally, a demand for flowers, he pointed out. And, if we can ensure quality and get these to the market, and out of the country, fast enough, we could benefit, he said. This is why, he said, his government was focusing on roads.

Dwelling on grain production, he said there is more than enough grain so there should be no reason for complaints that it is not reaching everybody. Yet it doesn''t, he said, asking farmers to inculcate the habit of saving each grain, just as the effort is to save each drop of water.
