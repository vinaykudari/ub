1,LUSU a big let-down for chief minister,"Q: You have been criticised for reviving students'' union in universities and colleges even when these unions have been responsible for criminalisation of campuses in recent years?

A: How many incidents of criminal nature took place before or after the elections? Give me one instance. And if criminal elements are trying to take refuge in hostels in the guise of students or are being sheltered by union leaders in the guise of students it is the responsibility of university and college administration to bring it to the notice of the district administration. Hamein batayein. Hang me if I don''t act or if the district administration does not help them out.

This is what chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had told this writer on October 9 this year. Barely two months have passed and the Samajwadi Party supported Lucknow University Students'' Union has begun to flaunt its true colours.

Over the last few days they have held the university administration to ransom and the district administration has opted for a politically correct stand: stay aloof.

The university administration, on its part, has done what it thought was the best and honourable way out â€” resign. All 21 of them. It is perhaps for the first time in LU''s history that the entire administration has resigned and the vice-chancellor, Prof SB Singh, too is mulling resignation.

But it is also the first time that students have damaged a statue of Swami Vivekanand and hurled choicest of abuses on the vice-chancellor using an amplifier.

Those who have no respect for a saint like Swami Vivekanand can''t be expected to hold the VC in esteem. It is unfortunate that such elements are part of a university campus instead of being where they actually belong â€” the gutter.

It is also the first time that some students, claiming to be union leaders, have decided to extort money from some teachers and employees. That apart, beating up of teachers is beginning to become the order of the day. While one teacher was assaulted in front of his wife, two others were beaten up in front of students for trying to prevent copying.

According to a senior teacher, it was with great difficulty that the academic atmosphere had been restored on the campus. Now the present LUSU set-up is out to destroy it. ""The teachers have never felt so humiliated,"" he said while expressing his complete lack of faith in the district administration.

""It is pointless telling them all this as they wouldn''t like to do anything that would get them marching orders from the state capital,"" he said and asked, ""isn''t it important these days to keep the ruling party leaders in good humour?""

According to him, the only persons who can salvage the situation are the chief minister himself or his son Akhilesh.

So far, the V-C has been able to meet only the Chancellor, who can''t do much. He is yet to get an audience with the chief minister.

2,BJP split between 'harmony vote' and 'feel-good factor' for LS polls,"NEW DELHI: Will the Vajpayee government advance the general elections or hold them on schedule in September 2004? While a final decision, BJP sources said, will be taken when their national executive meets in Hyderabad on Jan 17, a fierce debate on the issue is currently raging within the party.

The Prime Minister would like to use the next eight months to consolidate what is being described as the â€˜â€˜harmony voteâ€™â€™, sources said. The PM wants to demonstrate that his Pakistan peace initiative is working, specially since â€˜â€˜peaceâ€™â€™ is listed as a top priority with most young voters. A recent survey says these voters will play a crucial role in the next elections.

If the ceasefire continues till September, terrorist activity is reduced to a minimum and Pakistan is engaged in a positive dialogue, the PM feels it would be Advantage BJP with the young and liberal voters.

Those who support the PMâ€™s stand feel the BJP has to increase its vote base and find new allies. In its strongholds of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat and Maharashtra (the last with ally, Shiv Sena), it peaked in the last LS polls, winning 100 of a possible 146. Even in Bihar/ Jharkhand, it won 41 seats â€” with its allies â€” of 54. So where are the new votes to come from?

One, from the â€˜â€˜harmony voteâ€™â€™ and the other from Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. Sources said the BJP wants to give UP CM Mulayam Singh Yadav time to consolidate his position to win at least half the stateâ€™s 80 seats. Reason? If the NDA requires a block of 40-odd seats after the LS polls, the Samajwadi Party can oblige it. In Karnataka, the BJP is a non-starter on its own and needs time to reforge its ties with the JD-U.

On the other hand, another section in the party wants early elections to exploit the â€˜â€˜feel-goodâ€™â€™ factor generated by the recent elections. In particular, the BJP MPs of MP and Rajasthan are pressing for this because they are worried the newly elected CMs â€” Uma Bharati and Vasundhara Raje â€” may not be able to deliver on their electoral promises.

Their first acts â€” banning cow slaughter in MP and ordering the singing of Vande Mataram in government schools in Rajasthan â€” are being cited by nervous MPs as unlikely to help them re-win their seats. They seem a far cry from the new mantra of development.

3,Kerala farmers get hooked to 'Safed Musli',"KOCHI: ''Safed Musli'', a herb which has immense therapeutic value and rich in herbal steroids, is slowly catching the interest of farmers in Kerala, besides the other southern states.

Farmers growing the herb in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have formed an association - Safed Musli Growers Association of South India (SAMUGA) to safeguard the interest of the cultivators, association president H R Murthy told reporters here.

Lots of enquiries have come from Kerala seeking information about the crop, seed material and its cultivation, he said.

''Safed Musli'', a medicinal crop classified as ''Divya Aushad'' in Ayurveda has various medicinal values. It is a Rasayani, a total body rejuvenator, an antioxidant and Immuno-modulator. It is used as an anti arthritic and anti cancer drug and has also aphrodisiac properties.

Murthy said that the association was engaged in continuous market research and product development and was knocking all doors to open a right international market.

He said that ''Safed Musli'' had been identified as ''Herbal Viagra'' and dried tubers were being exported to Middle East and Europe. It was widely used as a strong immuniser and remedy for diabetes and hypertension.

Scientists were working out the medicinal property of Safed Musli, which was also believed to be more effective in treatment of AIDS as immuniser, he said. It is also used by women during pregnancy and post-natal treatment in some states.

The association helps the farmers in selection of good seed materials, imparting cultivation technology and provides marketing assistance.

4,"We'll defend our case, says law minister","CHIKMAGALUR\BANGALORE: A day after the Supreme Court stayed Karnataka''s notification re-appointing 5,014 government employees under the rural weightage scheme, law minister D.B. Chandre Gowda held out hope to the aggrieved candidates that the case will be ""effectively defended.""

Speaking to the Sunday Times of India in Chikmagalur, Gowda said: ""According to the information, the stay has not been granted and the case is slated to be heard on Monday. But even if the apex court has stayed the rural weightage case, we will effectively defend it.""

Gowda said the state had examined the rural weightage issue and the apex court judgment. ""It is our view that the state has powers to make a one-time appointment of the employees displaced by the judgment. That is why we issued the notification,"" he maintained.

The apex court gave a judgment on October 11, 2001, striking down appointment of candidates under the rural weightage clause where jobs were reserved for those who studied in rural areas. The contention was that the clause violated the articles of equality and equal employment opportunities to all citizens given under the Constitution.

Though nearly 13,400 people have been employed with the rural weightage benefit, the court order impacted only 5,014 persons, who were given their appointment orders after November 11, 1996. The Karnakata government implemented the order, sacked these employees and appointed others to their jobs as per the original merit list.

However, even as some of the sacked candidates committed suicide, the state government notified special rules for re-appointment of these employees either to existing vacancies or in newly created jobs.
