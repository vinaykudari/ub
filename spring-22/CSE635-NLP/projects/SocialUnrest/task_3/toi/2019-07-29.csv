0,Trial in Ramesh Kini suicide case to begin today,"MUMBAI: Six years after city resident Ramesh Kini died under mysterious circumstances in a theatre at Pune, the trial in the case which evoked a political controversy would commence in a sessions court here on Monday with the prosecution examining its first witness.

Kini''s death had raked up a controversy with police charging Shiv Sena leader Raj Thackeray with the conspiracy leading to Kini''s death.

CBI, however, exonerated him from the charges.

On June 27, Judge S P Nikam had framed charges against Kini''s landlords Laxmichand Shah and his son Suman. Altogether 130 witnesses have been cited by the prosecution in this case.

Laxmichand and Suman have been charged with section 306 IPC (abetment of suicide), section 386 IPC (extortion by putting victim in fear of death) read with section 34 IPC (common intention) and section 120-b IPC (conspiracy).

Another accused Ashuthosh Rane, a Vidyarthi Sena leader, was discharged on April four by the trial court due to lack of evidence.

Kini was found dead on June 23, 1996 at Alka theatre in Pune. A bottle of cyanide was found in his pocket. Police initially suspected suicide but later it was alleged that he consumed the substance under pressure from the accused.

The case of the prosecution is that the landlords of Kini wanted him to vacate the rented premises and pressurised him time and again. It was alleged that they sought help of Sena leaders Ashutosh Rane and Raj Thackeray in this regard.

Public Prosecutor S L Deshpande would conduct the trial while noted criminal lawyers Harshad Ponda, Satish Maneshinde and Sayaji Nangre would defend the accused.

1,Washington nudges Delhi for J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: Since last September, New Delhi and Washington have marched lock-step in dealing with terrorism. Despite dismay at Pakistanâ€™s new found importance in Washington, India has accepted the US role and its advice in resolving the Kashmir problem and dealing with Pakistani belligerence.

But there are important differences between the two, especially in dealing with Kashmir. Some of which were visible on Sunday, when US secretary of state Gen Colin Powell declared that the US wanted India to go ahead with the Kashmir elections, accept independent observers and release political prisoners.

The way the US sees it, the elections are the first step in the process of resolving the Kashmir problem. Their quick conclusion will help New Delhi to pull back its forces that remain massed on the border and reduce the risk of an India-Pakistan conflict.

It will also aid in the final step â€” an uninhibited Indo-Pak dialogue â€” needed to settle the dispute.

Indiaâ€™s compulsions are different. Elections, especially those in which the domestic separatists participate, will help in marginalising Pakistan and winning back the hearts of the Valley populace. Those willing to stake their lives in the process have signalled that they could do so if the polls were held minus the Abdullahs, which means postponing the poll date.

Some officials in New Delhi are inclined to agree with this since they want the opportunity to clean up some of the human rights mess made by the J&K government and provide the Valley districts with a modicum of governance that is needed to showcase the elections to the people of the Valley and individual, though not institutional, observers.

New Delhi doesnâ€™t want to forgo the opportunity that comes once in five years to root out separatist sentiment in the state.

US compulsions arise from a wider regional perspective and it appears willing not to look too closely at the â€˜free and fairâ€™ element. With the compulsion to certify another poll, that in Pakistan in October, the US is unlikely to apply too exacting a definition on what is a free and fair poll.

Powellâ€™s visit has not come up with anything dramatic, but it was not likely to. The time for theatrics has gone and Powell is not that kind of a man, anyway.

2,Clockwork rule puts colleges in a fix,"MUMBAI: Hereâ€™s the new profile of the Mumbai university college teacherâ€”he gets a measly Rs 75 per lecture without other benefits, travels from college to college every day to earn more and has no permanent place in the staff room.

The Maharashtra governmentâ€™s recent policies on recruiting teachers has created this freelancing tribe in an already tottering education system. Instead of filling up the 250-odd vacancies in city colleges, the government has been asking college authorities to hire teachers on a clock-hour basis and pay them by the hour. It is even going to start a system of hiring teachers on contract.

Last month, the government added one more clause to its list of dos and donâ€™ts for principals: teachers hired on a clock-hour basis should not take more than seven lectures per week. The latest missive has left principals reeling because it means that they will have to hire a handful of lecturers just to teach one subject.

â€œA full-time teacher takes 21 lectures per week,â€™â€™ explained Y.B. Bhide, principal of SIES College of Commerce and Economics, Sion. â€œThis means we will need three clock-hour teachers to make up for one vacancy.â€™â€™ For the money they were offering, it would be difficult to find that many candidates, said M.R. Kurup, principal of Vaze College, Mulund.

Each of the 90-odd city colleges already have two or more clock-hour teachers. The number is even more in some colleges like Siddharth College of Arts, Science and Commerce at Fort, where 14 of the 49 teachers are working on a clock-hour basis.

The government decided on this seven-lectures-only rule to prevent teachers from staking a claim to their posts, it is learnt. â€œWhen they take a higher number of lectures, they may reach the level of a parttimer or a full-timer. Many teachers then approach the college tribunal or the courts for commensurate benefits,â€™â€™ said Mr Kurup.

The governmentâ€™s efforts to clip clock-hour teachersâ€™ ambitions will have a â€œdisastrousâ€™â€™ effect on education, said C.R. Sadasivan, member of the Bombay University College Teachersâ€™ Union (Buctu). â€œIt will create a problem for students, they will have different people teaching the same topic and there wonâ€™t be any continuity.â€™â€™ Ultimately, it would send more students running to coaching classes, teachers said.

3,Oppn set to raps govt over scams,"MUMBAI: A slew of scandals and acute drought will cast a lengthening shadow over the monsoon session of the state legislature, which begins here on Monday. On the opening day, the two houses will be adjourned without transacting any business as a mark of respect to vice-president Krishna Kant.

The ruling Democratic Front and the opposition Shiv Sena- BJP combine are expected to lock horns on the floor of the house over a noconfidence motion, sponsored by the opposition combine, against legislative assembly speaker Arun Gujarathi.

As a counter-move, the DF, which has a clear majority in the legislative council, is already armed with a similar motion against council chairman N.S. Pharande, a senior BJP leader.

â€œInformal talks are underway (with the Sena-BJP combine) to find a way out of the impasse. The opposition may withdraw its motion following the talks. But if it insists on going ahead, the DF will table the motion against Mr Pharande,â€™â€™ minister for legislative affairs Rohidas Patil told TNN on Sunday.

The opposition, on the other hand, suspects that the state government may pack up the session in a weekâ€™s time. â€œThe DF has neither the expertise nor the courage to convince the us on a number of issues,â€™â€™ said leader of the opposition Narayan Rane.

According to political observers, the saffron combine, after failing to bring down the ruling DF in a hastily-planned coup last month, will leave no stone unturned to put the Congress- led state government in a tight spot during the two-week session. â€˜Operation Toppleâ€™, which saw several Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and independent legislators joining hands with the opposition combine, had tapered off following the DF winning the trust vote at special one-day session in Mumbai on June 13.

Unfazed by the June fiasco, the Sena-BJPâ€™s gameplan is deepen the divide between the Congress and the NCP, who share an uneasy partnership.

The cooperative bank scam, in which several NCP heavyweights are involved, and the Maharashtra Public Service Commission scandal, at the centre of which former vice-chancellor Mumbai University Shashikant Karnik, will keep the Sena-BJP guns booming in the assembly.

The opposition is expected to insist on a high-level probe by the CBI into the Home Trade scandal which has brought into question the role of co-operative banks in the state.

The saffron combine will also take the Vilasrao Deshmukh ministry to task for the â€œfailureâ€™â€™ of the state administration to provide relief to farmers in view of the statewide drought. The state has sought an aid of Rs 205 crore from the Centre to expedite relief measures, including supply of drinking water to starving villages and seeds and fodder to agriculturists.

Urgent issues, including the state-sponsored hike in school fees, the increase in power tariff and transport fares, â€œdeterioratingâ€™â€™ law and order situation and the sale excess land belonging to textile mills, will keep the MLAs busy in the state legislature, provided, of course, they curb their penchant for the theatre of the absurd which is routinely played out in the â€˜wellâ€™ of the assembly, say Vidhan Bhavan watchers.

4,Efforts on to prevent farmers' clash,"LUCKNOW: Officials posted along Bihar-Uttar Pradesh border near Ballia-Chapra districts have stepped up efforts to prevent clash among farmers of the two states during the harvesting of crops.

The dispute over ownership of more than 17,000 acres of land along the border had been cause of conflicts between Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The dispute eluded solution in spite of repeated attempts made by the centre for the past 30 years. The dispute has claimed several lives.

All attempts made by the governments of the two states failed to resolve the matter because the river which earlier used to serve as a barrier kept on changing its course, making it difficult for the officials to find out the alignment of lands.

Now the district officials have again woken up to the problem and held prolonged consultations to prevent clashes among farmers living along the border. clashed for ownership of the crops cultivated along the border, said an official.

In view of the possibility of clashes, several voluntary organisations have urged the government to settle the dispute for once and all.

5,Row over DIG remark pro-govt remark,"HAJIPUR: The statement of Tirhut range DIG S K Bhardwaj here recently that the Hajipur-based businessman, Anil Kumar Bubna, was kidnapped just to slur the image of the Rabri government has created a controversy in the political circles.

Bhardwaj appears to be in a catch-22 situation in the wake of his own statement.

According to the Vaishali police, the kingpin of the six arrested kidnappers, Rambabu Rai, had hatched the plan to abduct Anil Kumar Bubna near the main party office of the BJP on the Beerchand Patel Path in Patna a couple of days back.

But the million dollar question is if Rambabu Rai is a BJP leader of Saran then how did he dare to play an instrumental role in the kidnapping of one of the relatives of leader of the Opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi?

The district police admit this syllogistic point but claim to be ""helpless"" before their seniors, who are supervising the case.

According to reliable sources, Rambabu Rai, mukhiya of the Hilaspur panchayat under the Nayagaon police station of the Saran district, has links with the leaders of the ruling party.

He has played a decisive role in favour of some BJP and RJD leaders during the last assembly and parliamentary elections.

Besides, he has also been welcoming the most powerful leader of the ruling party whenever he crosses Nayagaon by road.

Preferring anonymity, a senior official of the Nayagaon police station disclosed that Rai owns a big factory of illicit liquor in the remote parts of Nayagaon in alleged connivance with some powerful political bodies.

Bhardwaj''s statement has evoked more reactions in the local political circles than appreciation for police. ""The DIG seems to be on a political mission to please the RJD chief for his continuance in the office further,"" said Pramod Singh, a BJP leader.

However, DIG Bhardwaj denied having given any statement on the issue. He also denied having said anything about the involvement of any MLA in the incident.

A senior police official said on the condition of anonymity that the police should unearth the real plot behind the abduction than trying to give a political colour to the incident.

Meanwhile, the police have identified the owner of the Maruti car which was used in the abduction.

6,Jharkhand CM unveils new 'haat' policy,"RANCHI: Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi has announced a new policy for the management of ""haats"" (weekly bazaars). He has distributed letters of authority to more than 3,000 toll collectors in this regard.

At a function organised by the state agriculture marketing board amidst the uneasy calm that prevailed in the state capital recently, Marandi said the state government has decided to hand over the management of 631 such ""haats"" to tribals, members of the Scheduled Castes and weaker sections so that their exploitation could be prevented.

Marandi also ordered that the commission of the toll collectors be raised from the the existing 15 per cent to 20 per cent so that people work with dedication.

For the welfare of tribals, about 5,000 rickshaws would be distributed soon, the chief minister said.

He also reminded the gathering that the stipend for tribal students in technical institutions has been raised from Rs 450 to Rs 1000.

State agriculture marketing board''s managing director Rajbala Verma informed that 570 ""haats"" out of the 631 ""haats"" have already been settled in favour of groups selected by the people, thus giving employment to 4,663 men and women. More haats would be seettled soon, she said.

7,Dumka peaceful after domicile protests,"DUMKA: While the domicile policy has stirred the hornet''s nest in Jharkhand and tribal people and dikus (outsiders) are up in arms against each other in many places like Ranchi, Dhanbad, Bokaro and Chaibasa, the situation in Dumka, which is a tribal-dominated district has remained relatively calm.

Both the sections, particularly the tribal section, have shown remarkable restrain on this issue.

Three bandh calls given in protest against the domicile policy got overwhelming response here but they remained peaceful. On the other hand, the tribal organisations declared bandh twice within a week â€” on July 20 and July 24 â€” in favour of the policy.

However, contrary to expectations, they proved to be ineffective. It was observed that those who were opposing the domicile policy showed total solidarity, cutting across the party lines while the supporters of government''s policy remained confused regarding the imposition of bandh.

While on July 20, the Moolvasi Adhikar Manch which is leading the movement in support of the domicile policy withdrew its bandh call due to the rath yatra, the July 24 bandh remained ineffective because the local tribal students decided to chalk out their course of strategy after the decision of Jharkhand high court over the domicile policy.

The prevalent peaceful atmosphere in the second capital of Jharkhand seemed to be vitiated only once, on July 17, when a group of tribal students armed with traditional weapons took out a procession in the town and raised provocative slogans against the dikus.

They threatened the dikus that they should not oppose the domicile policy if they wanted to stay in Jharkhand. Despite provocation, the procession passed off peacefully around the town.

On July 18, those who opposed the domicile policy demonstrated their strength by making Dumka bandh a remarkable success. Interestingly, the tribal activists, who had warned the protesters earlier, did nothing to disturb the peaceful bandh.

The local political observers give credit to the JMM for maintaining peace in the district. This district is JMM''s strongest bastion.

They say that no tribal organisation can impose an effective bandh here without the support of JMM cadre. The JMM has launched many tribal movements in Jharkhand in recent years. But JMM supremo Shibu Soren is playing safe this time.

He has neither supported the domicile policy nor opposed it. He has left it for Marandi to decide.

8,Maoist violence feared in Nepal,"PATNA: Large-scale violence is apprehended in Nepal during mid-term poll in November with the outlawed Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) bracing to take on the army in a big way. The party has already decided to boycott the poll.

Rejecting the Maoistsâ€™ offer for peace dialogue, Nepal government has said they must first lay down their arms and â€œapologise for their mistakesâ€�.

In an interview to TNN, senior leader of the CPN (Maoist) Parmeshwar said: â€œWe are ready to resume dialogue with the government provided it forms an interim government in Nepal with equal representation of all parties.â€�

Ruling out any link with ISI, the senior Maoist leader said: â€œWe have lost over 4,000 cadres in recent years.â€� Asked about the fears of large-scale poll violence, he said, â€œWe cannot rule out the possibility. Our cadres would be trained to fight against the army,â€� he added.

Inquiries revealed that at present Maoists are active in 75 districts of Nepal, of which four districts, namely Rukum, Rolpa, Kalikot and Sindhudi, are under complete control of the Maoists.

â€œWe have waged a war against corruption, unemployment and retrenchment in the country. Two lakh people, including women, are enrolled as revolutionary guerrillas,â€� he said.

Asked how does the party mobilise funds to sustain its activities, he said that a large number of party supporters employed in the government in base areas donate a part of their salary to the party.

Besides, the party collects agricultural tax from farmers and a sum of Rs 6.5 crore has been looted from banks operating in different parts of Nepal, he said.

â€œWe have also succeeded in killing 700 armymen during their operations in the recent months and in looting a large number of SLRs and pistols.â€�

In order to generate awareness about the on-going movement in Nepal, a national-level conference is likely to be held in New Delhi sometime in the first week of August under the banner of the Bharat-Nepal Jan Ekta Manch.

Criticising the â€œarbitrary actionâ€� of the Nepalese government, he said: â€œWe are fighting for a new constitution of Nepal which provides for an equal participation of all parties, but, unfortunately, we have been branded as a â€œterroristâ€� organisation,â€� he said.

10,Centre policy on hawkers drafted,"KOLKATA: The Centre has drafted a policy on street hawkers, accepting them as an essential part of city life, rather than a menace.

The Union ministry of urban development and poverty alleviation has shaped this policy following the recommendations of a task force.

The new policy seeks to strike a balance between the vendorsâ€™ right to livelihood and the need to protect public space and traffic flow. It prescribes hawking zones, identity cards and registration of hawkers and a role for them in the decision-making process.

It also asked the Centre and states to make legal changes to end the cat-andmouse game between the police and hawkers and stem corruption. The vendors pay both registration fees and maintenance charges.

The ministry estimated that two per cent residents of a metropolis belonged to the vending community. Mumbai has 250,000 street vendors, while Delhi and Kolkata have 200,000 and 150,000, respectively.

â€œOur objective is to make street vendors a special component of urban development,â€� pointed out Shaktiman Ghosh, a member of the task force and leader of the Hawker Sangram Samiti.

While asking for demarcation of hawking zones, it cautioned against relocating hawkers ignoring their natural propensity to trade in certain places.

Such zones would be decided by a town-level committee comprising police, municipality, land-owning authorities and representatives of hawkers and traders.

The committee would ensure weekly markets and markets after non-working hours with car-parking spaces. It would also monitor waste disposal, toilets, mobile stalls and issue identity cards to the hawkers.

13,Coded messages from PoK increased after Mush's speech,"JAMMU: There was a ""clear increase"" in the volume of coded messages emanating from control stations in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) to militants in the state even after Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf''s assurance to end cross-border terrorism, a defence spokesman said on Monday.

""The cross-border managers of terrorist outfits are increasingly passing classified messages reassuring the cadres that the ban on infiltration is temporary and asking them to step up activities in the months to come,"" he said.

""It shows the lack of serious intent on the part of Pakistan to curb cross-border terrorism...It is a commonly known fact that the control stations are practically co-located with the Pakistan army units and, therefore, cannot operate with such impunity without the sanction of the Pakistan government,"" the spokesman said.

The spokesman was quoting the findings of an analysis of the volume and contents of the terrorist radio traffic over five weeks from May 21, one week prior to Musharraf''s speech, to June 24, four weeks after it, carried out with a view to determining whether Pakistan has laid restrictions on the terrorist organisations to stop cross-border terrorism.

Within the valley, except for a ""slight decline"" in the transmissions among the cadres of Lashker-e-Taiba immidiately after the general''s speech, there was no change in the levels of transmissions of any outfit, he said. The fall in the LeT transmissions might have been due to the ""temporary element of caution"" which was discarded from the week that followed.

On the other hand, the transmission of Hizbul Mujahideen showed a spurt, he said.

17,"Foreign students beat up MSU teacher, arrested","VADODARA: For the first time in the history of M S University, foreign students beat up a teacher following a fracas. Two Sudanese students allegedly hit a teacher in the Fatehgunj area on Sunday night.

Psychology lecturer at Padra College B S Parimal was passing through Fatehgunj when Naserahmed Sudani and Salat Sudani allegedly stopped and abused him. The two then beat up Parimal, who had to run away from the spot when one of the accused picked up a stick to beat him.

A complaint lodged with the Sayajigunj police station by Parimal alleges that Naserahmed owed him a sum of Rs 4,000. The student was in dire need of money about an year ago and had borrowed the amount from Parimal. Both the accused were arrested by the police in the wee hours of Monday.

""A couple of days ago, when I asked him to repay the loan, he used foul language. On Sunday night, I was on my way to purchase some medicines, when the duo stopped me and one of them started beating me,"" Parimal said.

Parimal said he had good relations with Naserahmed earlier. ""He used to come to my residence to meet me. We were good friends,"" Parimal said.

According to Parimal, Naserahmed had apparently misled the other student. ""Apparently he had told him that I used foul language for Sudanese students. This false information had made Salat furious,"" he said.

University authorities, meanwhile, said they were waiting for a complaint from the teacher in this regard. ""Once we get it officially, we will initiate action. If an the inquiry finds the students guilty, they will definitely be thrown out. However, for this we will have to inform their embassy,"" said Pro-Vice Chancellor V D Pathak.

While the university might take action to punish the students, the faith of a teacher seems to have taken a blow. ""People used to talk all sorts of things when these boys came to my place, but I defended them. Now that faith is shattered,"" said Parimal.

19,Free-for-all at chief minister’s residence over new dists,"SHIMLA: How sensitive the issue of carving out new districts in the state is likely to become in the days to come became clear, on Monday, when a scuffle broke out between residents of Palampur (Kangra district) and Rohru (Shimla district) at Oakover, the Himachal Pradesh chief ministerâ€™s official residence.

Sources told Times News Network that delegations from Palampur, owing allegiance to the BJP and Rohru Congress loyalists) had gone to Oakover, on Monday morning, to solicit the CMâ€™s support for carving districts out of their regions.

The delegations had been raising slogans in support of their demand at the reception area of the CMâ€™s residence.

This stirred off a heated contest between the two. Within no time the scuffle turned into a free-for-all. Peace returned only when the staff and policemen on duty swung into action.

The CM and his supporters, sources said, felt that they could have inadvertently stirred a hornetâ€™s nest by making public the governmentâ€™s proposal of carving new districts in the state.

The BJP justifies the proposal by pointing out the imbalance in the state. At present 34 assembly segments are being controlled by three deputy commissioners in three district while the remaining 34 are under nine deputy commissioners in nine districts. The proposal could be based on solid ground but it would be difficult to rise to the expectations of all the state residents.

Former chief minister Virbhadra Singh had said recently that the expectations of the people could be met only if 68 new districts were created.

This would roughly mean that each assembly segment is converted into a district which was near impossible.

Later, addressing the delegations, chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said that the matter of converting Palampur and Rohru into districts would be considered on merit. He added that it had always been the endeavour of his government to provide responsive and transparent administration.

Dhumal said that the Rs 12 crore mini-secretariat at Dharamshala would soon be dedicated to the residents of the state.

He also said that the proposal for rain water harvesting in the state would be sent to the Government of India in the face of the near droughtlike situation in the state.

20,Students now need to reveal family income,"PUNE: As if the University of Puneâ€™s fee hike wasnâ€™t enough, the Maharashtra education directorate has issued a circular to colleges asking them to get forms giving details of family income and other tax issues filled from students.

While majority of the students are in the dark about being asked to provide these details, colleges say they are only following the directorateâ€™s instructions.

â€œI have no clue why the district education officer has asked us to collect such data from students,â€� said principal of a college in Pune, adding, â€œI am only doing what the directorate has asked me to do.â€�

Deputy director, higher education, S.N. Malode said the decision was taken to keep a check on students who claim that they are from economically-backward classes by submitting false facts.

Only those students whose family income is less than Rs 15,000 can lay a claim for an EBC status and get financial assistance from the government, Malode said. He, however, said there were no plans to assess the studentsâ€™ claims.

21,Din in House over minister’s remarks on Kant’s death,"MUMBAI: Maharashtraâ€™s industries minister Patangrao Kadam on Monday created a flutter in the state legislative assembly when he hypothesised about the cause of vicepresident Krishan Kantâ€™s sudden demise.

Participating in a debate on a condolence motion, Mr Kadam said he guessed that Mr Kant had died because the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre had not endorsed his candidature for the presidency. â€œThis may have shocked him deeply,â€™â€™ he said. When Mr Kadam began his speech on the condolence motion, a minister of state is believed to have sent him a hurriedly-scribbled note suggesting that the former should refer to the â€œshockâ€™â€™ which Mr Kant suffered because of he wasnâ€™t a candidate for the highest office.

Senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde was quick to take exception to Mr Kadamâ€™s soundbytes. Speaker Arun Gujarathi, who was in the chair, added a postscript that Mr Munde also wanted to be expunged from the record. The speaker promptly accepted the BJP leaderâ€™s suggestion. â€œMr Kadam is believed to be in the race for chief ministership. He should exhibit some restraint,â€™â€™ Mr Munde remarked.

However, Mr Kadam was in no mood to curb his eloquence. Condoling the death of industrialist Dhirubhai Ambani, the industries minister said the Reliance had twice invited him for a meeting. â€œBut I didnâ€™t accept Mr Ambaniâ€™s invitation. On the third occasion, however, I met him.

Mr Ambani told me that he and myself had started from scratch. We both have begun with a zero and, as such, we both belong to the zero club,â€™â€™ the minister mused, even as members looked askance, wondering about the relevance of the remark. The condolence motion marked the commencement of the annual monsoon session of the state legislature. The House adjourned for the day without transacting any business.
