0,Student morcha to protest axing of grants,"pune: the state government's decision to effect massive cuts in the grants given to educational institutions in the state in the next academic year has come under attack from the students' federation of india (sfi). the federation will take out a morcha to the pune university campus on december 20 to protest against the government decision. only last week, the state government had filed an affidavit in the bombay high court stating its intention to cut grants for educational institutes from the next academic year. the government has hinted that this will result in a significant fee hike and, except for students from below poverty line (bpl) families, others will have to cough up more towards fees. the government as part of its ""austerity measures"" has also decided against starting new primary or secondary schools, technical or agriculture institutes and giving fresh grants to private organisations to set up educational institutes. a statement released by sfi said that the government's affidavit clearly states that grants given to educational institutions for paying salary to staff or for meeting other expenses will be reduced in a piecemeal manner, and will be subsequently stopped completely. the sfi charged that the government has also decided to charge fees from students belonging to the backward classes and from the economically poor sections. as the sfi has pointed out, this cutback has come at a time when the union government has tabled the 93rd amendment bill that offers free education to students in the 6-14 age group.

4,High incidence of incest in slums: Survey,"lucknow: blasting the myth of security and safety offered by families was ranjana gaur from varanasi. a random survey conducted in the holy city by sarc, an ngo gaur and her associates run, brought to light some of the most unholy facts. almost 80 out of 100 girls upto the age of 16 interviewed by them, primarily from the slum areas of kasai bada, ulfat bibi-ka-haata or phulbaria cantt, admitted that they had been victims of sexual abuse by their own kith and kin. the offenders named by them included fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins and other relatives. some of them pointed accusing fingers at the neighbours and even doctors. interestingly, only two girls out of the lot said that the offender was a stranger. however, only nineteen victims could muster enough courage to report the matter to someone in the family. and some kind of half-hearted action was taken by only two families, in the rest the matter was hushed up promptly and the girls were ordered\coerced into silence by the leaders in the family, says gaur. one of the victims, nivedita (name changed), an orphan who apprised her grandmother of her uncle's molestation attempts, was point-blankly asked by the other members of the family why was she late in bringing the issue in the open. she was then advised to let 'bygones be bygones"". the girl had no choice but to feign forgiveness as she had to live among the same people. lambasting the conspiracy of silence, the ngo blamed the powerful and overactive nexus of police, doctors, family and society to keep the unpalatable truth under wraps. ""it is very rarely that the victim approaches the police for protection or complaint."" and in a few cases like a particular instance of rape of a five-year-old girl last year, the police refused to lodge an fir initially and then the medical report held that there was no injury found on the body of the child, who, according to gaur, remained hospitalised for five days.

10,Sanjay Dutt's lawyers dispute police claim,"mumbai: in an interesting debate before a designated tada court, actor sanjay dutt's lawyers on thursday disputed the police claim that dutt, an accused in the 1993 serial bomb blasts, was arrested on april 19, 1993. the defence lawyers argued that there was no evidence on record to show dutt's date of arrest. the lawyers said that in the absence of any evidence regarding dutt's arrest, his alleged confession was wholly inadmissible. making their submissions before tada judge p.d. kode, defence lawyers rajender singh and satish maneshinde said the alleged confession which the prosecution had relied on to build their case against the actor was also ``not voluntary''. they said the recording of the alleged confession did not follow the proper procedure laid down in law. mr singh also sought to establish that the alleged confession in which the actor had said he possessed an ak-56 rifle was not recorded in a free and fair environment. ``the confession was not independently recorded,'' as the police officers, including the then dcp before whom it was recorded, were connected with the investigations of the blast case, the lawyers reasoned. dutt's lawyers said the confession was ``not free from interference, threat and coercion.'' the point being made was that the way the confession was recorded, it was not voluntary and thus not admissible in law, but dutt's lawyers did not say that coercion was in fact used. mr singh pointed out that as per the prosecution dutt was supposed to have been arrested on april 19, 1993, by a police inspector by the name of lomte, but there was no evidence to prove this. however, when asked by judge kode for his views, special public prosecutor ujjwal nikam pointed out a remand report made by mr lomte which recorded the actor's arrest on april 19 after his return from mauritius. mr nikam said the then designated tada judge, j.n. patel, was also informed verbally by dutt that he was arrested on april 19. the statement was recorded in the court's `roznama', he added. in response to judge kode's query, mr nikam said such a recording in a roznama did not amount to a substantive piece of evidence, but ``as a record of court it could be read as evidence.'' mr nikam had earlier submitted that dutt, after his arrest on april 19, 1993, had made a confession on april 26 and retracted it only after a year on november 9, 1994. he said until his retraction, dutt had never disputed his confession __ on the contrary, he was maintaining that the weapon was an exercise of his right to self-defence.

12,Maharashtra's new labour laws get Centre's nod,"mumbai: the ruling congress-led democratic front (df) government's proposed modifications to the two key labour legislations - the industrial disputes act (ida) and the contract labour (regulation and abolition) act (cla) - have been approved by the union government. with the union cabinet giving its go-ahead, the maharashtra government will shortly restructure the rules for employment, retrenchment, compensation and shut-down of unviable units. under the amendments to the ida, employers will find it easier to retrench workers and also shut down or restructure loss-making units. the new law waives the necessity of obtaining a clearance from the government in case of retrenchment by the employers of an industrial unit with 300 or more employees. the compensation after lay-offs, under the new law, includes salary of 45 days for every completed year as against the earlier 15 days. the revised procedures to the cla will ensure ""greater flexibility"" in the hiring and firing of employees. under the existing provisions, the employers were restricted from employing casual labour in services which are permanent in nature. however, the revised norms seek to modify the law where the employer can hire casual workers and also permits out-sourcing. jobs of those employed in canteens, security departments, courier services, gardens, transport, loading and unloading activities will be deemed to be temporary in nature. targeted at encouraging investments and entrepreneurs, the new rules promise greater flexibility for employers to hire and fire staffers. while the trade unions have denounced these changes and are preparing for a long-drawn battle, the policy-makers in mantralaya and industry captains insist that the amendments would help create new jobs. chief minister vilasrao deshmukh had proposed the amendments declaring that it was part of the df government's attempts to shape up for the future. for deshmukh, however, the reforms plan promises to be a tight-rope walk. he will have to shore up support not only from industry leaders, trade unions and the constituent parties of the df but also from the congress high command. the congress party's central leadership has publicly been announcing that it would not endorse any move by the bjp-led government at the centre to revise labour laws. the business world, however, has welcomed deshmukh's reforms agenda. ""it is a step in the right direction. with the new laws allowing use of contract labour, and flexibility for restructuring or closing down a unit, the investors will prefer india to china,"" arvind jolly, president of the indian merchant's chamber said.

""whatever has happened has brought to the fore the friction within the bjp in the state,"" he said, adding that his exceptionally good relations with kalraj had led to his arrest. ""i had refused to contest the elections on the bjp symbol when the cm asked me to do so. the equations in my constituency do not permit me do so so,"" amarmani said, adding that he had put all his might to see that the bjp-led government remained in power in the state.

16,'Medical research budget may increase four-folds',"new delhi: government plans to increase the outlay for medical reasearch four-folds in the next budget, union minister for health c p thakur said on friday. to further boost medical research in the country, the budget for medical research would be increased by four times, thakur told reporters inaugurating the ""53rd indian pharmaceutical congress 2001,"" here. he said although the country occupied a place of pride in the global pharmaceutical arena as the fourth largest producer of drugs, per-capita consumption of drugs in the country was still very low. ""access to medicine and affordability by vast populations is the biggest challenge facing the country,"" he said. in such a scenario, the pharmacists have a major social and professional responsibility to ensure supply of quality medicines, their appropriate storage, delivery and usage, thakur said. he said in spite of government's initiative to allow only pharmacists to sell and distribute drugs, there were complaints about sale of spurious or counterfeit drugs in certain parts of the country, adding ""such aberration has to be collectively fought by pharmacist community and the industry in association with the drug regulatory machinery."" thakur said that strategic alliances, tie-ups, understanding and exchange of information and technology had almost completed the country's integration with the world and three years later the implementation of gatt would further hasten the easy advent of new technologies in the country. delivering the presidential address, s k kulkarni, head, university college of pharmaceutical science, chandigarh, said the draft paper on the national health policy failed to refer to the services of pharmacists in health care delivery and management. ""it is time that government recognises the pivotal role of pharmacists in delivering cost-effective drug therapy as a member of the health care team,"" kulkarni said. he said establishing of five islands of excellence in pharmaceutical sciences at ideal locations in the country with defined thrust areas for research and training to meet the post-gatt challenges should be vigorously pursued. majority of pharmaceutical institutions are handicapped with non-availability of basic infrastructure, resources for purchase of modern equipments and the research environment, with the result classical approach to research methodologies continues, kulkarni said. he said there was urgent need to train the country's pharmacology graduates in regulatory affairs, preparations of dossiers and patent and ipr issues. on the occasion, thakur released the "" good clinical practices,"" guidelines for carrying out clinical trials of drugs in the country. the 54th indian pharmaceutical congress would be organised in pune in december next year and would be presided over by v v desai, former drug controller of karnataka.
