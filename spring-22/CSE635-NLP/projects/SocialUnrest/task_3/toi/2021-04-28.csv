0,State election officials are a disgruntled lot,"MUMBAI: The state election commission is an all powerful body, thanks to the Seshan effect. But the fact is that it is a rag-tag band of disgruntled government employees.

Sources say this could be a reason why there were so many gaffes in the voters list.

The enumerators and inspectors who make up the bulk of the state election commission are drawn from government offices and municipal schools much against their will. Even the IAS officer posted at the top is usually someone whom the ruling parties donâ€™t want to see too often.

As a posting, the election commission ranks low on the IAS officerâ€™s list of preferences. â€œThere is no work at all, except during election time,â€™â€™ observes a former chief electoral officer.

It is the field staff who have their work cut out for them round-the-year. The state election commission has only about 80 people who can be counted as permanent staff.Most of their work is, therefore, done by the government staff, sourced from other departments, particularly schools. The field staff conducts a regular update of electoral rolls undertaken by the state EC.

The state EC conducts intensive revisions once every five years and summary revisions are done once every year. Intensive revisions include house-to-house visits to identify voters whereas summary revision includes modifications to the draft electoral list made on the basis of applications received.

â€œWe face paucity of funds, manpower, resources,â€™â€™ says an election official. And the staff roped in for the work are naturally not too happy to be doing the rounds. Joint chief electoral officer K V Kurundkar, however, disagrees.

â€œThe same set of election staff that has done the census work before is roped in as enumerators and supervisors for the intensive revision of electoral rolls,â€™â€™ he says. â€œThey are well-trained and have been doing the job efficiently since 1951.â€™â€™

However, election officials point out that the same staff is entrusted with doing repeated enumeration for different agencies. â€œThey do the head count of citizens for the census, voters list, and education and health-related data,â€™â€™ says one of them. â€œIt is difficult to keep their motivation high.â€™â€™

1,"Exit polls make Cong, NCP smile","MUMBAI: The Congress-NCP combine was in an upbeat mood on Tuesday with the exit polls giving it a lead over the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance in Maharashtra which has a crucial 48 seats in the Lok Sabha.

â€œThe exit polls reflect the popular mood which is unequivocally anti-saffron. The Congress-NCP allianceâ€™s tally in Maharashtra will be much more than the projections made by TV news channels,â€™â€™ said MPCC chief Ranjit Deshmukh.

He attributed the upward curve in the Congress-NCPâ€™s poll graph in Phase II to â€œgreater cohesion and coordinationâ€™â€™ between the Congress and the NCP. â€œThe Lucknow sari stampede and the BJPâ€™s virulent campaign against Sonia Gandhi, which didnâ€™t go down well with the voters, also backfired on our opponents,â€™â€™ Deshmukh said.

MPCC general secretary Sanjay Dutt said, â€œThere was tremendous coordination between the Congress and the NCP. Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde campaigned for both Congress and NCP candidates and so did NCP chief Sharad Pawar.â€™â€™

According to NCPâ€™s Mumbai unit chief Sachin Ahir, â€œThe interval between the first phase, which was held on April 20, and the second one enabled the Congress-NCP alliance to gear up its poll machinery and close in on the Sena-BJP combine.â€™â€™

Former chief minister Narayan Rane of the Sena questioned the accuracy of exit polls which, he reminded, had gone wide off the mark in the Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh assembly elections in December last year.

A similar view was expressed by BJP state unit president Gopinath Munde. He said the sample selected by the TV channels was very small compared to the large number of people who voted. The past record of those conducting exit polls also does not inspire much confidence. The exit polls particularly worried the saffron combine.

â€œThe result in the Lok Sabha polls is likely to affect our performance in the assembly elections in September. This is what is worrying us,â€™â€™ a BJP activist admitted.

2,Exit polls not exact polls: CM,"TIRUPATI/HYDERABAD: Yet more exit polls predicted doom for the TDP government on Tuesday but Chandrababu Naidu dismissed them as â€œexit polls not exact polls.â€�

The NDTV exit poll on Tuesday predicted 180-205 seats for the Congress-TRS alliance and 80-105 for the TDP-BJP alliance but to re-porters searching his face for signs of defeat, the chief minister did not look care-worn.

Looking relaxed dur-ing his visit to the TDP office after a morning spent in leisure at home, Naidu of-fered to sit with the scribes after the actual results are out to show how exactly poll-sters got it wrong.

â€œIâ€™m not in the habit of giv-ing exact numbers. Thatâ€™s done by parties which know they canâ€™t come to power,â€™â€™ Naidu quipped.

Naiduâ€™s home minister De-vender Goud too insisted that the party was headed back to power, but gave the first inkling of the churning going on within the TDP. In what could be an admission that things may have gone wrong with the TDP, Goud said in Tirupati that â€œthere is strong dissidence in the TDP in all districts and that cost us dearly in the elec-tions. That is why the TDP needs a revamp.â€™â€™

He went on to add that al-though the TDP government took up various welfare and development schemes dur-ing its nine years, â€œwe failed to do justice in providing em-ployment to youth and water facilities to the farm sector.â€�

He said the party would pay attention to these when it comes back to power. He added, â€œNo party in the coun-try has come to power for the third successive time.â€� On the other side of the fence, the Congress was not caught in any cleft, and app-eared raring to take the reins. Congress star campa-igner Y S Rajasekhara Reddy shot off a letter to chief secr-etary Mohan Kanda request-ing him to rush aid to farm-ers who lost crops due to uns-easonal rains and hailstorms in five Telangana districts.

While the chief minister vehemently stuck to his posi-tion that the TDP would be back in power, he turned his ire on the EC, finding fault with its summary revision of the electoral list which led to the deletion of a large num-ber of names.

He lashed out at EC con-sultant K J Rao who visited the state during the voter list revision. Describing Raoâ€™s behaviour as â€œviolent,â€™â€™ he said the official created a panic by asking state elec-tion officials to fix an upper limit for the number of vot-ers and delete the remaining ones. This resulted in bulk deletions, he said. He ex-pressed dissatisfaction over the enforcement of the mod-el code of conduct which pre-vented his government from taking up drought relief.

EXIT POLL: NDTV

Total seats: 294

Congress+ 180-205

TDP+ 80-105

Others 5-10

3,It’s mating season in political country,"NEW DELHI: Now that itâ€™s more likely to be rolled over in Assam, the BJP might kiss and make up with AGP. In fact, the reports are that AGP is again on BJPâ€™s most-favoured list. And the overtures might work as AGP and BJP have a common enemy in Congress.

Itâ€™s a similar story in Haryana. The cocky state unit convinced the BJP bosses that there was an Atal wave in the state. Hence, Haryana Vikas Partyâ€™s mating calls were spurned by the BJP. As it transpires, it was a gentle breeze for Vajpayee at best, not a wave. HVPâ€™s Surendra Singh, son of Bansi Lal, earlier wasnâ€™t demanding the moon from BJP, and in a hung House scenario, he might still do business, but for a higher price.

In the race for power, every fish matters, big or small. Former PM H D Deve Gowda may win just two seats in Karnataka, but he may well choose to ally with the Congress given his greater aversion for the BJP. The Trinamul Congress has been in and out of the NDA. Mamata Bannerjee has also allied with the Congress. But this time around she may stick with the NDA, for a while.

BSPâ€™s Mayawati, after announcing that seat-sharing talks with the Congress were over, had in typical fashion poured invective over the latterâ€™s manuvadi policies. But she is learnt to be in touch with BJP leaders like Arun Jaitley. Now, if the talk of a Vajpayee-Mulayam Singh duet actually turns out to be true, the BSP may not be averse to a second look at Sonia Gandhi. And if thereâ€™s a situation where both the NDA and Congress are competing for her hand, it might go to the highest bidder.

Tamil Nadu politics revolves around the theme of Duryodhana and Dushasan, or, of revenge and vengeance. The AIADMK and DMK coalitions are busy bad-mouthing each other, but what if Amma is unable to confound opinion polls and doesnâ€™t do well at all? In that case, at least one member of the DMK configuration, Vanniyar leader and PMK boss S Ramadoss, can move camps with mind-boggling speed.

DMK boss M Karunanidhi may not find it so easy to shift allegiance even if Amma is out of the NDA. Even if he makes a move, it will be after a certain cooling off period. He would have to consider his moves on the prognosis for the Assembly elections â€” for that is main prize. With ideological lines blurring, constancy is hardly a political virtue any more.

4,"Bhatia, BJP men clash at poll booth","PUNE: Tension gripped parts of Golibar maidan area towards the end of polling on Monday, after Independent candidate and retired bureaucrat Arun Bhatia and his workers allegedly clashed with BJP polling agents at the Ambedkar Primary School.

Policemen had to be rushed in large numbers to defuse the situation. After hectic negotiations, the police were able to pacify both the parties. Both the sides later registered complaints with the Wanowrie police.

Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II), Vitthal Jadhav, told TNN that the Wanowrie police were completing the formalities of registering the complaints of both the sides after which proper investigations would be conducted.

In the complaint registered by the BJP worker, Devendra Bhatia, Arun Bhatia entered the polling station around 5.15 pm, pushed the BJP workers around and barged his way into the booth.

He, then, allegedly abused the BJP workers and pushed them, when they tried to reason with him. He also alleged that Bhatiaâ€™s body guards threatened them at gun point.

In the cross complaint, Bhatia alleged that when he reached the booth, some of the women voters told him about the irregularities going on at the booth.

He further alleged that the polling agents of the party were misleading the voters by telling them that their names were missing in the votersâ€™ list and that others were casting bogus votes on their names.

When he went inside the booth, Arun Bhatia was surrounded by BJP workers, who allegedly manhandled and abused him.

5,Roads blocked to protest killing,"PATNA: Traders, on Tuesday, blocked roads at three different points, at Dariapur, Bari Path and Sultanganj areas of the city in protest against the Monday night killing of a trader, Dharamvir.

All the shops in Dariapur and Bari Path areas remained closed till late afternoon.

Later police reached the spot and got the blockade removed. Dharamvir was shot dead near his shop ""Goodwill Footwear"" on Bari Path on Monday evening. Criminals had also lobbed bombs in the same shop. On the condition of anonymity, other shopkeepers of the area attributed the incident to Dharamvirâ€™s refusal to pay extortion money to a criminal gang.

Trouble began in the morning when report about Dharamvirâ€™s killing spread like a wild fire in Bari Path and Dariapur areas. Shopkeepers of various markets including Khetan, Rajdhani and Lalji markets in both the areas soon downed their shutters and sat on a dharna on the road. They demanded immediate arrest of the criminals involved in the killing.

Most of the shopkeepers blamed the police for not paying adequate attention towards their problems. According to them, a police patrolling vehicle was parked in Dariapur Gola area at the time when criminals lobbed bombs and killed Dharmvir. ""Instead of chasing the criminals, the police party disappeared from the spot soon after the bomb explosion,"" one of the trader of Dariapur Gola told TNN.

Meanwhile, a group of traders sat on dharna with Dharmvirâ€™s body demonstrating in front of Sultanganj police station. They also blocked the road for a few hours. Later police intervened and got them removed.

When contacted, city SP Amrit Raj said that police are investigating the case from all possible angles. Meanwhile, police have recovered the body of a man from an area under the Aalamganj police station on Monday night. Police are yet to ascertain the identity of the deceased.

6,"Countermand Chhapra polls, urges Rudy","PATNA: Union minister and BJP candidate from Chhapra parliamentary constituency Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that large-scale violence in Chhapra on the polling day belied the hopes of people who were left thinking whether it was a battle of ballot or that of bullet. Rudy on Tuesday met the special poll observer and faxed a written complaint to the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) demanding countermanding of Chhapra polls.

""I am sure of my victory yet I want the polls to be countermanded for the survival of democracy,"" Rudy said.

""The way the election was conducted in Chhapra by the district administration in cahoots with the RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav has certainly blotted democracy,"" Rudy charged.

He said that 498 booths were declared super-sensitive by the returning officer but only 20 per cent of such booths were covered by the central para military force (CPMF) while the rest were left at the mercy of RJD goons, state ministers and their henchmen.

Before the elections, apprehending large-scale violence in the constituency, Rudy had requested the returning officer to cover all such booths with CPMFs as per the guidelines.

Instead, many booths remained uncovered by force while a good number of policemen who were deployed for election purpose were sent to the local police line, he alleged.

Rudy, further said that state minister Udit Rai and his henchmen went to a booth and fired at the voters, killing one of them on the spot.

The worst scenes were witnessed in Parsa, Marhaura, Garkha and Taraiya where another state minister Chandrika Rai and his bodyguards were seen creating trouble.

Worst of all, chief minister''s brother Subhash Yadav, was moving freely in spite of the election observer''s order that he be deported out of the district.

Consequently criminals had a field day which was evident by the incidents of 700 countrymade bomb explosions and open display of firearms.

""I urged the EC to countermand the entire Chhapra election and provide a level playing field for the contest by deploying CPMF at booths,"" Rudy said and added that 368 booths in Chhapra were captured.

He also said that approximately 20 electronic voting machines did not function on the polling day which was reported to the authorities, yet, neither replacement nor rectification could be done indicating poor preparedness.

Meanwhile, a delegation of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders comprising Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha and Awadhesh Narain Singh has left for Delhi on Tuesday afternoon to apprise the CEC and central party leaders about the large scale violence and rigging in Chhapra.

7,Cong will form govt: BPCC chief,"PATNA: Buoyed by the sliding popularity of the NDA government after the second phase of Lok Sabha elections, BPCC president Ram Jatan Sinha on Tuesday said Congress will come out with flying colours and form the next government at the Centre.

At a Press conference held at the BPCC headquarters, Sinha said NDA will be rooted out and PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee will have to again sit in the opposition.

He said Congress will win all its four seats in the state. Stating that the BJP-led NDA will get a major drubbing in Bihar, Sinha said, ""Had the Congress been allotted a few more seats in the state, the NDA would have been completely wiped out."" Stating that the mass base of the Congress is widening, Sinha said the Muslims are once again coming back to the party. Citing the example of Uttar Pradesh where Congress expects to get Muslim votes, he said the people can now see through the false promises made by the NDA government.

""By handing out a mandate against the NDA, the voters will prove that they can''t be taken for a ride.""

On the irregularities during polling in Chhapra parliamentary seat, he admitted to incidents of rigging on a wide scale. Though Sinha didn''t make a formal demand for repolling, he said action should be taken on the reports submitted by concerned presiding officers.

He dismissed BJP''s demand for countermanding of polls there. Answering a query why the top leaders, including party president Sonia Gandhi, did not campaign for party candidates in the state, Sinha said, ""The state leaders are enough to shoulder the responsibility. Soniaji is busy campaigning in other states where the party is contesting on a larger number of seats.""

8,Reds are an extinct species: Advani,"DURGAPUR: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Wednesday dubbed communists as an ""extinct political species"" and slammed the Left Front, ruling West Bengal for the last 27 years, for its failure to inject work culture, which was standing in the way of investments coming to the state.

''''Communists have become an extinct political species in most parts of India and surviving only in West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura,'''' Advani told an election rally for BJP''s Lok Sabha candidate Sibnarayan Saha, at the Rajiv Gandhi Maidan, here.

Advani said, ''''the Left Front is ruling for the last 27 years. Absence of work culture, besides trade unionism are standing in the way of bringing investments to the state.

''''If the trade unions call bandhs, who will come here to invest?'''' he asked.

Despite investment potential, he said lack of proper atmosphere was ''driving away'' investors and there had been flight of capital.

Pillorying the CPI (M)-led government, the Deputy Prime Minister said ''''West Bengal does not figure in competition which is going on among the states. Yet West Bengal had the potential to be a front-runner among states.''''

Advani alleged that ''one-party rule'' had been continuing in West Bengal for the past several years. ''''That is why they have no excuse to offer for failure to attract investments,'''' he said, expressing the Centre''s concern at the situation.

He appealed to the electorate to vote for the Nationalist Trinamool Congress-BJP combine ''as it is truly anti-Left and anti-Congress.''

Advani said the NDA government was seized with the investment situation in Left-ruled West Bengal, but added ''''under the Constitution, it is the responsibility of states to take the initiative''''. He criticised the Left Front campaign that the NDA government had sought to weaken the public sector.

''''We are not for weakening the public sector. A misinformation campaign is being carried out by leftists,'''' he alleged.

9,"No chance of a third front govt: V P, Chandra","NEW DELHI: Predicting a hung Lok Sabha, former Prime Ministers Chandrashekhar and V P Singh on Wednesday said a third front government looked unlikely.

""A third person (becoming PM) is not a third force,"" Chandrashekhar told reporters at his residence here when asked what role he saw for the third front in the event of a hung house.

Both Chandrashekhar and V P Singh, who was also present, said it looked like there would be a hung Parliament adding those projecting more than 300 seats for NDA were ""day dreaming.""

According to Chandrashekhar, the realignment of forces in the post-poll scenario would gravitate towards the camp that would most likely be in a position to form the government.

However, commenting on which way Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav would go, he said, ""As much as I know Mulayam, he will not support the NDA. He will do so only after leaving politics.""

Mulayam and Amar Singh, SP general secretary, have time and again said they do not support BJP, he said adding there was no reason to disbelieve them.

Incidentally, SP did not put up a candidate against the former Prime Minister in Balia in Uttar Pradesh, which went to polls on April 26.

Singh, however, refused to comment on his reported remarks that only Congress could provide an alternative to the NDA and ducked questions on Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin.

10,"Vote BJP for strong govt, urges Atal","FARRUKHABAD: Seeking another innings to complete his development initiatives, Prime Minister Vajpayee urged a big gathering at the Christian College ground here to vote the BJP-NDA for a strong and stable government. â€œVote for a tikaau (stable) and not a bikaau (saleable) or khaau (dishonest) government,â€� he said.

He recalled the political uncertainty when he took the national governmentâ€™s reins in 1996 and of having completed a five-year term despite heading a multi-party coalition government. â€œNDA has shown coalitions can last long if leadership is mature and itâ€™s the peopleâ€™s turn to repose faith in the same coalition,â€� he said.

He took a dig at NCP chief Sharad Pawar for claiming he, too, was in the race for Prime Minister. BJP has projected its Prime Minister, but the Congress could not and the reasons are obvious now, he said. He assailed Congress president Sonia Gandhi for saying the NDA government had ruined the nation in the past five years.

11,SC sends notices in RS polls case,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Centre, Attorney-General Soli J Sorabjee and all states and Union Territories on a plea by a former Rajya Sabha member challenging the recent amendment to the election law which had dispensed with the requirement of domicile for candidates contesting for Parliamentâ€™s Upper House.

The former Rajya Sabha member, Kuldip Nayar, also sought stay of the Rajya Sabha elections due in July or decide the case prior to it, but a Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare, Justices S B Sinha and S H Kapadia said the plea would be considered on July 12, the next date of hearing. The court also asked Nayar to file the grounds on which he wanted the 2003 amendment to be declared unconstitutional.

Some 75 members, roughly one-third of total 250 members of the Upper House, are due to retire in 2004 and the issue needed to be decided on a priority basis, he added. Nayar submitted that under Article 84 (C) of the Constitution, it was laid down in the Representation of the People Act that a candidate to the RS should â€˜â€˜ordinarilyâ€™â€™ be a resident of the state concerned.

â€˜â€˜By dropping the requirement, Parliament has sought to change the basic structure of the Constitution,â€™â€™ Nayar said in his April 26 letter to CJI Khare which has been treated as a writ petition in public interest.

Nayar referred to a letter by former President R Venkataraman, who was a member of the Provisional Parliament, agreeing with his views on this point. Participating in a debate on an amendment to the RP Act on May 11, 1951, the then law minister B R Ambedkar had â€˜â€˜affirmed that the member of the RS should represent the stateâ€™â€™.

Nayar cited the example of the US where Congressmen and Senators were required to be inhabitants of states concerned. Unlike the Lok Sabha for which candidates are not required to be inhabitants of a particular state or UT, domicile was specifically made a pre-requisite in the original Act for candidates contesting RS elections as they were supposed to represent their respective states, Nayar added.

12,Central team assessing riot witness security,"AHMEDABAD: A Union home affairs ministry team is in the state to assess the security provided to witnesses of riot cases in which trials have been stayed and are under the Supreme Court scrutiny.

Headed by Intelligence Bureau (IB) IGP Yashovardhan Azad, the team has two CRPF officers and they have been visiting the riot-hit areas for the past two days.

Apparently, when the team met DGP AK Bhargav on Tuesday, he is believed to have suggested deploying Border Wing homeguards for protection of riot witnesses as an alternative. The BW homeguards are raised by the state with grants from the Centre, but are not a central paramilitary force. The SC had suggested that a central paramilitary force be deployed for security of the riot witnesses.

On Tuesday, the team visited the Naroda Patia, Naroda gam and Gulbarg society where the Ahmedabad city police has provided protection to 137 witnesses. In all some 300 witnesses need to be assured protection under the SC directive. The team left for a village in Sabarkantha on Wednesday along with Gandhinagar (range) DIG PK Jha.

There some 30 witnesses in the Sardarpura massacre case of Mehsana are staying, and have been given protection by the Sabarkantha police. They also visited Dipda darwaja area of Visnagar taluka in Mehsana.

When contacted on Tuesday, Bhargav said state police had already provided protection to witnesses of some riot cases, but more cases have been added to the list.

Reflecting on the situation, he said, â€œfor each witness three security personnel will have to be spared as they would be doing eight-hourly duty on a rotational basisâ€�. Right now 24 companies of the BW homeguards have been sent to Rajasthan for poll duty and the others are guarding strong rooms where EVMs have been kept.

13,Cong frowns at May 1 bash at govt expense,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee has criticised the Election Commission for having â€˜relaxedâ€™ the code of conduct to allow the Narendra Modi government to celebrate Gujarat Day on May 1, at government expense.

In a statement on Wednesday, general-secretary of the GPCCâ€™s legal cell Jitendra Malkan said that the Congress had complained to the EC about the fete amounting to a violation of the election code of conduct.

â€œWe are not against the celebrations, but two phases of the polls are yet to be conducted and the speeches made during that day could influence voters through the media, in other parts of the country,â€� Malkan pointed out.

He added that the speeches to be made during that day should be scrutinised by the EC three days in advance, since the rule had also applied to the advertisements, placed by the political parties.

14,Small trucks to go green with CNG,"NEW DELHI: Itâ€™s now the turn of Delhiâ€™s diesel light trucks (or LCVs) to go green. After reducing pollution levels by making all diesel buses and taxis run on CNG, the Delhi government has sent a similar signal for light trucks. The deadline: March 31, 2005.

By then, the pollution control authority hopes to phase out Delhiâ€™s existing 40,000-odd diesel-run light trucks â€” used to transport vegetables and goods â€” and replace them with CNG-powered vehicles. However, manufacturers have asked for a phased rollout that will target older vehicles first.

15,Govt moves to turn light trucks green,"NEW DELHI: After driving out diesel buses from Delhi, the government is now planning to do so with light trucks plying within city limits.

The Environment Pollution (prevention and control) Authority plans to restrict diesel-powered light trucks from plying within the capital from March 31, 2005.

It recently convened a meeting with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) expressing views and seeking clarifications from light truck manufacturers on the time needed to replace the existing diesel-run light commercial vehicles with CNG-powered ones.

A transport department official said regulation will be put in place soon.

""Our experiment with buses and taxis has been a success. We plan to extend it to LCVs. There has been a reduction in pollution, thanks to the government scrapping all diesel buses and taxis in the capital.""

Around 40,000 light trucks ply on the city streets.

The industry has suggested that an age be affixed on the existing fleet with the older vehicles being phased out first and replaced with CNG trucks.

In addition to help reduce pollution levels in Delhi, the move is expected to push demand for the automobile industry.

The commercial vehicle makers, who are seeing a revival with the massive road construction activities around the country, are hoping that fresh orders from this notification would further boost growth.
