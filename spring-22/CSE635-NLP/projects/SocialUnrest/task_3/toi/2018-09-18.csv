0,Congress seeks better deal for farmers,"pune: the contentious issue of the delinking of fringe villages from the pune municipal corporation (pmc), continues, with the local congress unit on monday urging its own cadres in the pmc to amend the draft development plan (dp) for the 38 fringe villages. the congress, it may be recalled, wants to retain all 38 villages originally slated to be in the pmc fold. however, divisional commissioner umeshchandra sarangi, who had been commissioned by the state government to inquire into the matter, had recommended that 15 villages should not be linked to the pmc. in his report, mr sarangi had upheld the charge that the draft dp of the 38 villages, prepared by a private firm of engineers and urban planners, was unfair to some farmers. lands owned by builders have remained free of reservations, while lands belonging to farmers have been reserved for various civic amenities, the report concluded. chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has upheld the sarangi report and asked the ud department to put up a proposal before the state cabinet meeting scheduled for wednesday for the de-linking of the 15 fringe villages. mr joshi is now planning to scuttle this delinking move by expressing his willingness to redraft the dp. in a letter to mayor datta gaikwad, he has demanded that the dp for the 38 villages be re-drafted in such a manner that lands owned by 'poor farmers' remained free of any reservations. when asked why the demand to redraft the dp was not made earlier, mr joshi claimed that then the charge that the planners had favoured builders had not been proven. now, the sarangi committee has upheld the charge, he said. mr joshi, however, clarified that the congress did not want the civic administration to appoint a new agency to redraft the dp. the dp could be redrafted by the city improvement committee members with the help of pmc engineers, he said. ironically the congress district unit is in favour of delinking of the 15 villages. it had reportedly burnt the effigies of mayor datta gaikwad and rajya sabha member suresh kalmadi in manjri village last week. congress mla and party leader in the pmc chandrakant chhajed on monday conducted a meeting of party corporators to condemn the act. the meeting resolved to lodge a complaint against officials of the pune district congress committee with mpcc chief govindrao adik.

""out of the 150 seats, only 10 are reserved for women in the pass-holders' compartment, and male passengers think that women cannot occupy seats other than the reserved ones even if they are empty. as such, they often harass women occupying general seats,"" ms shrivatsan said. one of the four accused who harassed ms shrivatsan had six months ago pushed a woman out of a train when she was about to alight. ms gorhe, herself a pass-holder, said women were scared of boarding the first class pass-holders' compartment due to the objectionable behaviour of some male passengers. ""it is high time the railway authorities clarified that women can also occupy general seats in the pass holders' compartment,"" she said.

10,Monetary incentives for cattle catchers,"kanpur: it just about takes kanpur to lead the way in the state. when metropolises all over the country are faced with the problem of stray cattle, kanpurites can now actually make money on the issue. an easy buck and all while doing a good act. the kanpur nagar nigam has announced monetary incentives for every bit of cattle turned in. the incentives range from rs 100 to 400 or upwards. of course the largess depends on the largeness of the animal turned in. the kanpur nagar nigam had evolved a new scheme to catch the stray cattle in city. knn, which had failed to revive its defunct cattle catching department, would now be providing attractive incentives to people for catching stray cattle from their respective localities and handing them over to the nagar nigam. the idea was to lure volunteers to flush out stray animals which were creating havoc in the city. kanpur mayor anil kumar sharma formulated this idea to catch stray cattle which roamed the city posing a hindrance to smooth flow of traffic on the roads and causing undue hardships to people in the streets. there were several thousand such stray animals in the city including 6,000 pigs, about 2,000 dogs and a few thousands mules and bulls. the knn would provide rs 400 for each cow, buffalo, bull and ox and rs 300 would be paid for each horse, mare and mule. the rate for each calf would be rs 150 and rs 100 for each donkey, goat, sheep, pig and piglet. a similar scheme was was presently going on in delhi and had been introduced by the delhi municipal corporation. residents of the city had been complaining about the stray cattle for a long time now but the nagar nigam had so far been unable to deal with the problem due to scarcity of funds in its cattle catching department which had been lying defunct. earlier, the knn had been planning to eliminate the stray cattle by giving them poisonous injections or shooting them on the spot. but this seemed to be a costly affair. now knn had planned to provide incentives to cattle catchers.

17,Anju Ilyasi case: Homicide not ruled out,"new delhi: at least 12 new facts put out by the police and an expert opinion submitted by a top forensic expert now suggests that many crucial details may have been glossed over before concluding anju ilyasi, wife of former serial producer suhaib ilyasi, committed suicide. anju ilyasi's death on january 11 last year in her east delhi flat had raised questions on whether she stabbed herself in the abdomen, as claimed by suhaib, or was murdered. the police had veered around to the suicide theory, bolstered by a report submitted by two members of a three-man forensic experts' panel set-up by the government, who concluded the same. the pitch, however, has now been queered with the third forensic expert dr l c gupta, specialist in forensic medicine in lal bahadur shastri government hospital saying there are enough grounds to conclude ""homicide cannot be ruled out."" sources said, gupta in his report submitted on august 30, had referred to the 12 new facts submitted to the panel by the investigating officer, calling them ""facts which cannot be considered of low weight."" he also stated ""forensic experts should not hesitate in interpreting opinion in the light of new facts even if there are deviations from the earlier conclusion."" dr r k sharma, associate professor in forensic medicine at aiims and dr alexander f khakha, forensic medicine specialist at safdarjung hospital had opined that the case was a suicide. the police will need to answer questions raised by these facts put out by the investigating officer, as well as dr gupta's dissenting explanations, before concluding what caused anju's death. a look at the new probe findings submitted to forensic experts and questions that now arise: * three diaries written by anju were recovered by the police. however, only two pages from one of the diaries were submitted to the expert panel for perusal at the time of interim forensic report. these pages contain material written over a year before she died, even though the last page was written a month ago. why were the other pages not given to the doctors? * fingerprints on the knife which killed anju belong to a third person. they don't match either anju or ilyasi's samples. with suhaib admitting no other person was present when the incident occurred and prints being that of probe team being ruled out, whose prints were they? * there is still no explainable reason for suicide. * there was sufficient motive to eliminate anju. * suhaib's personal security officer stated anju was completely normal and happy on the evening of her death. * suhaib gave bizarre statements to a doctor at virmani hospital on anju's condition. * very essential legal provisions were not followed at the virmani hospital, whose owner is also known to suhaib. * suhaib states he managed to snatch a revolver kept there, from anju's hand while she made a suicide attempt. but why did he become helpless in snatching the knife from her hand? it is also clear suhaib had sufficient knowledge that the heavy knife could be fatal for her life. * anju's blood was present on the bathroom wall and a drain. these findings contradict the written statement given by suhaib. * anju was not in her menstrual phase. therefore, presence of blood at some places, as said by suhaib, was not possible. * suhaib has also failed to explain blood on a site away from the scene of crime. * nail clipping samples give positive result for a positive blood group. no test has been done to determine the blood group of suhaib and no evidence of any counter injury on his body made available.
