0,Shift from foodgrains to flowers good for farmers,"hisar: dalbir singh, a small farmer of kharar alipur village, has moved from foodgrains to flowers. after taking a cue of diversification from scientists of the agricultural university, here, dalbir singh started floriculture on land measuring 250 yards, but when he found it profitable he extended it to one acre. he earned rs 2.5 lakh in one year. ''there should be a 'phoolon ki mandi' at delhi or its vicinity, from where the export market can be tapped, he feels. ''gladiolus flowers are in demand. if the seasonal flowers are also produced, there is an ample scope for growers. the income is five times more than in traditional farming,he maintains. dalbir singh says that in one acre he sowed only half a kilogram of seeds and the crop was ready to harvest within 75 days. he says he got a yield of fifty quintals of gladiolus flowers in one acre. ''gladiolus is an exotic flower but is being sought after in india, too. one acre yield means between 60,000 to 80,000 sticks of gladiolus flowers. any farmer can comfortably adopt floriculture with a little guidance. according to dalbir singh, flowers are in great demand, and in winters they can be preserved for longer periods.

2,EC makes two changes in rules,"pune: in a major change in the election rules pertaining to filing of nominations, the state election commission has ruled that political parties will have to certify the names of their official candidates on or before the last day of filing the nomination papers. this will affect those wards which have two or more strong contenders wanting the party ticket. the practice hitherto was for the party to allow all the strong contenders to file their nominations as independents, and make its final choice later. the party thus had breathing time till the date of withdrawals to finalise one of them and grant him/her the letter of official candidate. the new rule comes as a jolt to political parties which will have to sort out disputes about the official nominations and seat sharing with their alliance partners on january 10 - the last day of filing nominations for the february 10 civic polls. in another change in the election rules, the election commission has allowed schedule caste (sc) candidates from all religions to contest the elections from the municipal wards reserved for schedule caste candidates. earlier, the election commission had issued orders stating that only those sc candidates belonging to the hindu, sikh and buddhist religions were allowed to contest from these reserved wards. these orders were issued by the election commission on the basis of a specific ruling to this effect by the bombay high court's aurangabad bench. however, sc candidates from other religions challenged the high court's order in the supreme court. the apex court has admitted their petition and has stayed the high court order. rajendra nimbalkar, pmc's election officer, said that political parties can now file sc candidates from any religion to contest the civic polls.

5,Jail unrest exposes deeper rot,"kolkata: last week's agitation by prisoners at midnapore jail gave a peek at a widespread rot in the jail administration in west bengal. about 300 inmates — mostly convicts — went on a hunger strike for several days protesting against the death of a fellow-prisoner serving a life sentence. it took prolonged negotiations by senior officials including deputy inspector general (prisons) dipak chowdhury, who camped there, to make them give up, after 10 of them were hospitalised. a fact-finding team of the midnapore branch of the association for protection of democratic rights has revealed that there were bigger issues involved in the episode which must be addressed in order to prevent such situation in future. the prisoners were right, according to apdr, in alleging that the death of the lifer was a result of official negligence. the youth — in his thirties — had a cardiac arrest and complained of chest pain early in the morning. it took nearly three hours for a doctor to attend to him, and all the doctor could do was refer him to the midnapore sadar hospital. locating the ambulance driver and removing him to the hospital took some more time, and eventually, he reached there dead. more than individual callousness, this negligence seemed to have been the result of the system of jail administration. three doctors work part-time on contract as visiting physicians at the jail hospital, and in case of an emergency, there is no way one can get quick help. the first thing we are demanding is a full-time resident doctor in the jail, apdr midnapore branch secretary dipak basu told tnn. but there is another part of the story. the death due to negligence, the findings indicated, provided the immediate pretext for a vested interest group to take it out on the jail superintendent, panchanan biswas. the reason: the superintendent, who had joined only a few months ago, had checked a racket in medicines for the prisoners. from rs 2.5 lakh, the monthly expenses on medicines had come down to about rs 1 lakh. most of the medicines that were requisitioned, according to sources, were of little use to the inmates and somehow found their way to the market outside. curbing this racket had angered a section of the jail staff and their pet convicts. recalling that even the west bengal human rights commission, in its latest report, had deplored corruption in the state's jails, basu said that it was time the authorities woke up to such malpractice in prisons. that, however, requires political will, and there is no guarantee that it will be forthcoming. for, sources say, the situation at midnapore jail was complicated further by a political shadow fighting between two partners of the ruling left front. it could not have gone to that extent had not the jail staff unions controlled by the rsp and the cpm taken sides in the tussle.

6,Suci bandh widens Mamata-Panja rift,"kolkata: trinamul congress leader mamata banerjee's decision to extend moral support to the suci-sponsored bangla bandh on january 10 appears to have widened the rift between the party chief and rebel party mp ajit panja. if the suci's bandh becomes a success, it will be because of trinamul's support, said mamata, reiterating her party's 'moral' support for the bandh. but even as she extended her support, panja opposed it. the working committee has decided to oppose the bandh at its meeting. we do not support a bandh called by any party, panja told tnn. he even appealed to suci leader probhas ghosh, requesting him to call off the bandh as it would inconvenience people. according to panja, bandhs have been declared illegal by the supreme court which upheld decisions to this effect by the high courts in kolkata and kerala. the apex court has made a distinction between strikes and bandhs with the latter being declared illegal, asserted panja. he, however, was quick to add that his party supported the issues raised by the suci against the state government. we support the issues raised by the suci and urge them to use democratic means like law violation, non-cooperation and hunger-strike to register their protest, added panja. he also said the trinamul could not support the bandh call as it was directed against the centre and the suci was protesting against issues like disinvestment and prevention of terrorism ordinance. we cannot endorse a party's agitation directed against the central government policies as the trinamul was and still a member of the nda, contended panja. meanwhile, suci state committee member bidhan chatterjee attended a rally organised by the trinamul on friday in protest against the railway's move to evict squatters along the rail tracks in south kolkata. trinamul leaders pankaj banerjee, saugata roy and sobhandeb chattopadhyay also took part in it. speaking on the occasion, banerjee said that though the railway had enough land at its disposal, poor people were being evicted without compensation. a trinamul delegation later submitted a memorandum to the eastern railway general manager.

8,Three Arab nationals with Hamas links arrested,"lucknow: two jordanians and a palestinian national were arrested by the special task force (stf) and intelligence bureau (ib) on saturday after they were found in possession of fake passport and other documents. the three were residing at a rented house in indiranagar locality and are said to have links with the palestinian radical group hamas. sources said that one of the arrested accused was in constant touch with a few embassies in new delhi and their personal diaries and communiques have details of hamas on them. a bulk of documents seized during the raid had been handed over to raw and ib for further investigations, stf sources said. director general of police (dgp) rk pandit said that the arrested were identified as shameer and adnan of jordan and basheel of palestine who was based in delhi and had come to visit the other two in the state capital. he said that two of them were holed up in india for quite sometime now and the recovery of forged passports, marksheets and degrees of colleges in lucknow and delhi suggest that their purpose of stay was highly suspicious. ssp stf rajiv sabarwal said that basheel had been deported back to jordan twice in 1999 and 2000 from delhi. this time he sneaked into india through nepal and landed in uttar pradesh from sunauli border. he said the startling aspect of the documents recovered from their possession was that not a single page of their passports was left untampered. either the visa pages are missing or have been tampered with in one way or the other, sabarwal said talking to times news network (tnn). adnan is a computer wizard and was on the internet when we raided the house, said sp stf anant deo adding that he managed to delete some files from his pc before he could be overpowered by the sleuths. we have reasons to believe that he managed to launder some information which could have proved useful to us in terms of investigations, he said. adnan was also simultaneously chatting to someone on the net when he was picked up. adnan was also running a computer centre in indiranagar despite the fact that he did not have any degree or training for teaching, disclosed sp stf harish kumar. he said investigations were on to trace where the income from the computor centre was being diverted to.

9,Educational development bank mooted,"lucknow: there was a need to set up an educational development bank on the line of the industrial development bank to finance the higher education of poor students, said prof bm hegde, vice-chancellor manipal academy of higher education, while speaking at the third public forum on 'financing of higher education' at vigyan mandap here on saturday. ""if we want to achieve excellence in higher education, we must put an end to the licence raj, so that private institutions could be encouraged to join the field. at present anybody planning to open a quality higher education centre has to undergo so many steps that he ultimately drops the idea,"" he said. but, prof hegde warned against those private institutions, which duped unsuspecting students by charging exorbitant fees and providing nothing in return. ""there should be a body to scrutinise the quality of education provided by these institutions, so that they could not befool the students."" prof ashok kolaskar, v-c pune university, cited the example of his own university which had been showing others the way on how to ensure quality higher education at low cost. prof kolaskar suggested that to overcome the problem of financing, universities should enter into collaboration with industrial giants. pune university, he said, had formalised such a collaboration with zee tv and dishnet. for ensuring quality education at low cost, pune university has also experimented with hiring academicians of indian origin from abroad. ""since they are from india, they know the students and environment much better,"" said prof kolaskar. prof kb pawar, secretary, aiu came up with the idea of sharing of finances. ""engineering and medical colleges easily get higher fees from the students, but it's not in the case of humanities, so there should be a system by which the revenue could be shared."" he also recommended rationalisation of fee structure so that at least 25 per cent of the cost of higher education could be recovered. prof pawar also suggested options like deferred payment of fee - very much prevalent in australia - and 'graduatution tax', which meant a firm hiring a graduate should be made to pay tax and the collected amount could be put back into higher education sector.

10,"Mind continues to boggle all, including scientists","lucknow: it is unbelievably shocking, but true. the world health organisation (who) report has it. the number of patients suffering from brain disorders will be the highest than any other diseases by 2020 ad. at the same time, it is also true that no super computer can match the power of the human mind and its ability to perform certain specific functions in the cognitive process. the iiird plenary session of the indian science congress on saturday discussed in detail about the mind and its mechanism. the topic was 'molecules to mind' and in the chair was dr sp agarwal, director-general health services, new delhi, with prof gn pandey, university of illinois at chicago, usa, in the co-chair. speaking on 'demystifying the mind', prof pn tandon, nbrc, new delhi, said that the mind, a term often used interchangeably with consciousness, had remained shrouded in mystery throughout the recorded history of human intellectual endeavour spanning several millennia. initially, a subject of contemplation by religious seers and philosophers, it was only recently that techniques and technologies had been developed to bring it in the realm of scientific enquiry, he said. prof tandon also pointed out that the vedantic literature was replete with debates on this subject, so were the writings of early greek philosophers like plato and aristotle. notwithstanding the continued inability of the philosophers and scientists alike to arrive at an universally acceptable definition of the mind or consciousness, it is generally agreed that mental activity, which is the function of the mind, consists of a number of definable entities like perception, memory, volition, thoughts, emotions etc. an empirical study of these was hindered by their subjective nature which defied objective observations, he said. fortunately, the development of new neuro-imaging and other techniques during the last couple of decades had now made it possible to study these components of the ""mind"" in conscious, co-operative, healthy individuals and patients with brain disorders and damage, prof tandon said. thus, the repeated demonstration of consistent pattern of local brain activation during defined mental activity including thoughts, emotions, memory, learning, volition, even conscious awareness has brought the study of the mind into the realm of ""hard scientific enquiry"", he elaborated. this was not to say that the mystery of the mind had been solved like the mystery of the atom or the gene, he emphasised adding, yet there still remained many unanswered questions, specially one that concerned the inability to explain how neural activity associated with the cognitive functions distributed widely in the brain was integrated to provide a holistic subjective impression. currently this ""binding problem"" was under intensive investigations and discussion, he said. on 'rewiring the brain', prof mriganka sur, a fairchild professor of neurosciences, department of brain and cognitive sciences, mit, cambridge, ma, usa, compared the human mind with a super computer. he said that at least there were three specific functions — pattern recognition, reasoning and language— which the human mind performs at a far better speed than the 'machine' could do. the mit professor pointed out that selective rewriting of brain in young animals was being performed at an experimental level. the results, he said, had been startling. he further said that definite improvement in the environment is essential for proper mental growth of children in poor countries like india. prof vijaylaxmi ravindranath from nbri, gurgaon, said that brain related disorders afflicted large sections of the population. she was speaking on 'towards understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders'. considering the demographic profile of the country, both childhood-related disorders and neurodegenerative disorders were of importance. since the country had one of the fastest growing population and with increasing life span, the prevalence of neurodegenertive disorders was on the rise, she said.

""i am interested in contesting from kapkot, but let's wait for the party high command's decision in this regard,"" he said.

14,Civic polls: Political equations go for a toss,"mysore: the adage -- politics makes strange bedfellows -- has once again come true in the elections to the posts of the chiefs of town and taluk panchayats in the districts of mysore, mandya and chamarajnagar. leaders of the congress, janata dal (secular), janata dal (united) and bharatiya janata party (bjp), who on election-eve claimed of romping home with the posts of presidents and vice-presidents in these urban local bodies, are today disillusioned with their guesstimate going astray. the party leaders could not keep in check the members of the town panchayats and town municipalities and as a result a large-scale floor-crossings were witnessed in many of these urban local bodies. in some town panchayats, parties which won the election by a thumping majority failed to win the posts of president and vice-president. for example, in pandavapur town panchayat of mandya district, though the congress had more than 13 members in a council of 20 (excluding the vote of local mla and mp), the party's official candidate lost the election leading to a violent reaction from the losers. prohibitory orders had to be clamped on the town to rein in the congress workers, who went on the rampage and alleged that the failure of local congress mla and other leaders to keep the party members intact led to the debacle. in kollegal, it was a repetition of pandavapur town incidents and the congress lost the posts of both president and vice-president to the candidates supported by the janata dal (secular) and the bjp. the jd(s) leaders, who lost no opportunity in declaring that they will abide by the ideology of secular politics which meant in plain terms keeping both the congress and bjp at equidistance, reportedly gave a go-by to the very ideology in kollegal town municipality by aligning with the bjp to defeat the congress. whereas, the same jd(s) and jd(u) party members changed their stance and aligned with the congress to share power in heggadadevankote and in two or three more taluks in mysore and chamarajnagar districts. but in gundlupet, it was a reversal of fortunes for the jd(u) where it won the election easily if one goes by its number in the council. but the most shocking news awaited jd(u) mla mahadev prasad, whose untiring efforts made the party candidates return in large numbers to the municipality. the congress, which accounted for second largest number of candidates in the council, persuaded three of the jdu members to abstain from the crucial day of voting and succeeded in winning both president and vice-president posts. in the prestigious hunsur town municipality, the jd(s) played every trick in the book to engineer a split in the congress and winning both posts. while the post of president was won by the congress rebel candidate, the jd(s) bagged the vice-president's post. peeved at the rebellion in the party, the district congress unit expelled the newly elected president and even sought the intervention of the karnataka pradesh congress committee (kpcc) to stem the rot so that the party could be saved from a possible ruin in the district. all said and done, now after the elections, leaders of all parties irrespective of their ideological differences accept the fact that besides political manoeuvrings, money played a great role in the elections in these three districts. ``party affiliations and loyalty to the organisation mattered least for the elected members and they were carried away by various promises and offerings,'' says jd(u) leader mahadev prasad, also the legislator of gundlupet.
