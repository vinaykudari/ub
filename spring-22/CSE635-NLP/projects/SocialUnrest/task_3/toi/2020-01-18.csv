0,Parishad polls likely to be unopposed,"LUCKNOW: Four more nominations were filed on Friday, bringing the total number of candidates who filed their papers for the biennial elections to the Vidhan Parishad to 13.

With the Samajwadi Party expected to withdraw one candidate, elections to the 12 vacant seats of the Upper House is likely to be unopposed.

Those who filed their papers on Friday were Ramji Singh, Raj Kumar Tyagi and Surendra Nath Awasthi alias Puttu Awasthi of the BJP and Ranjit Singh Judeo of the Congress.

For Ramji Singh it will be a second term in the Vidhan Parishad if polls are held unopposed. Raj Kumar Tyagi is the president of western UP regional samitis of the BJP while Puttu Awasthi has apparently been rewarded for having vacated his Haidergarh seat in favour of former chief minister Rajnath Singh. Accompanying the BJP candidates at the time of filing nominations were senior leaders Rajnath Singh, Lalji Tandon, Vinay Katiyar and others.

Ranjit Singh Judeo, a former minister, filed his papers as the Congress candidate. The Samajwadi Party, which has fielded five candidates of its own and will support one of its ally, the Rashtriya Kranti Party, is likely to withdraw one candidate from the father-son duo of Ram Karan Yadav and Vijay Kumar. The actual picture will become clear once the withdrawals take place on January 20.

1,Mulayam demands money from party officials,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on Friday categorically told the party''s district and city unit chiefs that he would not address any meeting in their domain till he was given a ''thaili'' (bag) of at least Rs 10 lakh.

To be collected from the poor, one third of this money would be kept by him for state and central party affairs and the remaining two-third would be left behind in the district for its unit there, he added.

Yadav also slammed the BJP and called it ''Angrezon ki aulad'' for talking about Hindu dharma when our scriptures spoke ''sanatan dharam''. Hindu dharam, he said, was a legacy of the Britishers who wanted to divide the country on communal lines.

Addressing a sammelan of presidents of the district and the city unit presidents, vice-presidents and secretaries, Yadav said in future the treasurers would also be attending the same. He took the district and city units to task for not depositing the mandatory Rs 10,000 for life-time membership of the SP bulletin and said had it been any other party the same chiefs would have had to give Rs 10 lakh for the post held by them.

He said henceforth, if he was invited to address any meeting, the district unit presidents would have to give him Rs 10 lalk. The rule, however, would be waived in cases involving exploitation or killing of the SP workers. He stressed that the money so collected would not be from the rich but from the poor and would be utilised for strengthening their movement.

Spelling out some hard facts, the SP president said he was pained to learn that there were a few districts where there was no organizational set-up. Accordingly, he had directed state president Ram Sharan Das to give him a list of district units which had their own offices and those which were operating from rented ones. He stressed that in keeping with the changing times all such offices should be equipped with the latest gizmos. He quoted the example of the CPI(M) in this regard which had 414 functional offices. Remonstrating such lax presidents, he asked them to either mend their ways or he would be compelled to take action against them.

The SP leader acknowledged that â€˜groupismâ€™ and inability to actively involve the masses in the policies and programmes of the party had resulted in the SP not getting a clear majority. He asked party workers to establish a direct rapport with all sections of society and to take up reading of socialist literature seriously.

Hitting out at the BJP, Yadav said the party was responsible for the dismemberment of the country and added the killers of Mahatma Gandhi as also his thoughts were now occupying the seats of power Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. As opposed to them, the SP was above all considerations of caste and creed and was working for social change, which explained why all parties were against it. Yadav said he was not against aligning with any secular-minded political party but would not compromise on the party name, flag or ideology.

2,GIM brings in consensus on development issues,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala government''s Global Investor Meet (GIM) beginning at Kochi on Saturday is the first-ever conscious attempt by the state, with issue-based support from the Opposition, to showcase its core strengths to potential business players with a view to attracting the much-needed investment for economic growth.

Unlike in the past when political parties used to cross swords even on development issues, the main opposition LDF led by the CPI-M had offered co-operation for the conduct of GIM while insisting that projects should be transparent and should not harm the interests of the common man.

The government, on its part, had spared no effort to win the confidence of the opposition by convening an all-party meeting well ahead of GIM where it succeeded in getting the ""go-ahead"" from them.

""Infinity in a nutshell"" is the catchword for GIM, which is to witness the convergence of an array of global businessmen in the state''s commercial capital. Already rated as one of the ten tourist destinations in the world, the ""God''s own country"" is now focussing its attention on the hitherto-neglected area of industrial investment.

The cash-strapped Kerala seeks to utilise GIM to present before the investor the ""infinite"" investment opportunities in the fields of tourism, information technology, agro and food processing, infrastructure, bio-technology, urban development and real estate.
