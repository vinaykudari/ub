0,One cop killed in clash with militants in south Tripura,"AGARTALA: The armed militants belonging to Nayanbashi faction of the National Liberation Front of Tripura allegedly attempted to run over a District Armed Reserve (DAR) camp on Friday morning in South Tripura.

However, the DAR personnel and special police officers, formed by the local villagers as armed resistant groups, thwarted the extremistsâ€™ attempt successfully, but in the fierce firefight lost one of their colleagues. Four more were injured in the encounter.

The militants, dressed in olive green fatigues and armed with AK series rifles, attacked the DAR camp located at a remote tribal hamlet Maithulongbari (Baitalang). In the camp, apart from DAR personnel, some SPOs were also present. The policemen at once retaliated effectively though in the attack Subal Debbarma, a DAR constable, was killed and four others were injured. â€œThe DAR and SPO personnel showed an exemplary courage to prevent the extremists from running over the camp. We could recover 447 rounds of AK series bullets, which establish the heavy firepower of the raiding maraudersâ€�, said a police official.

He said that senior officers had rushed to the spot with reinforcement and combing operation was launched to nab the militants. This, the second attempt by the extremists storm DAR camp, which was foiled. On December 20, 2001, the militants pulled off similar assault at Urabari DAR camp in West district, which was also thwarted by the security personnel.

Meantime, three hardcore NLFT militants surrendered before the authority at TSR camp in Daluma, South Tripura. Sankar Jamatia, Samir Jamatia and Amulya Jamatia laid down one AK 56, Chinese Grenades and ammunition.

1,Dalit family has to bear brunt of Jat in-laws' ire,"NEW DELHI: A Dalit family in Narela has alleged harassment by a Jat family, following a marriage between members of the two communities. They alleged that despite complaints, the police had not registered a case.

The trouble started when the families found out that Satish Kumar, belonging to the Dalit family, had married Babita, the daughter of Bijender Singh, an influential Jat in Narela.

The couple got married on May 15, 2001. They registered the marriage at Tis Hazari courts a week later. The couple did not inform their families about the marriage immediately. On September 17, they left for Hardwar.

Meanwhile, Babita''s family registered a case of kidnapping against Kumar, claiming she was 17 years old. This was quashed by the court, after Babita''s birth certificate, which was submitted during the marriage registration, showed her to be over 18.

Kumar''s family alleged that the Narela police had called for Kumar''s brother Ashok, and beat him up during interrogation. They said the police repeatedly raided their house without any warrant. Kumar said the police team was often accompanied by Babita''s family.

When Kumar came to know about the kidnapping case, he reportedly dashed off proofs of his marriage to the Narela police and to the lieutenant-governor, but to no avail.

When Kumar returned from Hardwar on October 31, 2001, he was allegedly picked up by Babita''s family in connivance with the police.

""My house at Narela remained locked for seven months. We could not enter our village,"" Kumar has said in his statement.

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes asked the police to lodge a case against the Narela SHO and Singh''s family, and submit a report within a fortnight. The commission on December 5, 2002, again directed the DCP (northwest) to enquire into the matter. But the police are yet to take any action.

2,Lawyers clash with cops,"KOLKATA: Break the law and then scream murder. That was the case on Friday when lawyers of Bankshall Court went on the rampage after two lawyers were booked by police for jaywalking and assaulting policemen. Agitated lawyers blocked Netaji Subhas Road near GPO and even manhandled a minister.

Later, they threatened to go on a cease-work. Around 10 am, lawyer Debashish Karmakar crossed the busy N.S. Road and stopped a taxi. Sergeant Gairik Basu, who was on duty, curtly told him to follow traffic rules and cross the road at the zebra crossing. â€œThe infuriated lawyer along with his colleague Abhijit Banerjee tried to assault the sergeant.

Radio Flying Squad officers, who were nearby, came to the rescue of Basu and arrested the duo,â€� deputy commissioner headquarters K.L. Tamta said. Both the lawyers were taken to the Hare Street police station and booked under section 353 of the IPC for â€œdeterring a public servant from discharging his dutyâ€�. As news of the arrest reached Bankshall Court, agitated lawyers marched to the GPO area and squatted on the road for over 90 minutes, bringing traffic to a halt during the busy office hour. The protesters stopped irrigation minister Nandagopal Bhattacharyaâ€™s car and manhandled him. â€œOne of the lawyers said all ministers were animals. He later apologised to me but there were others who even manhandled me,â€� an agitated Bhattacharya said.

It was only after DC traffic M.K. Singh arrived on the spot and pacified them that the lawyers withdrew their agitation. A section of the lawyers, however, remained unrepentant. â€œThe police had no right to arrest us. They also roughed us up,â€� Karmakar alleged, showing injury marks. The lawyers later filed a complaint against the officers of Hare Street police station and went on a ceasework demanding punishment for the guilty policemen.

â€œThe police should not have roughed up the lawyers. But as lawyers we should be the first to follow rules instead of setting up road blocks,â€� said a senior lawyer. Bankshall court bar association secretary Baidyanath Das said the two booked lawyers were released on bail and would appear in court on Saturday.

3,2 Hizb terrorists arrested in East Delhi,"NEW DELHI: In a joint operation by the Delhi Police and the traffic police, two Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants were apprehended in east Delhi on Thursday evening.

The operation, led by the traffic police in coordination with west district police and special cell, led to the arrest of senior Hizb commander Feroze Ahmed Sheikh (34) and his associate Mehboob Jaan (30) near Mother Dairy, Patparganj.

The police said the accused are involved in seven killings and two attempted murders, including one of a Kashmir-based journalist. The militants specialised in killing politicians and police informers. Police sources say Sheikh was in the city to survey busy market areas and draw out plans for their operations.

The police recovered a loaded Chinese pistol with eight cartridges, a spare magazine containing eight cartridges and a foreign-made revolver with five cartridges.

4,MC president’s elections postponed again,"HOSHIARPUR: The meeting to elect Hoshiarpur municipal committeeâ€™s president was yet again adjourned till Saturday by election officer Harminder Singh, as majority of the members demanded the election process be started afresh and not from the point where it was postponed.

With the election officer (EO) bowing to the pressure of the entire house, as all the councillors were in favour of the election to be adjourned to end the controversy, the deadlock is expected to continue even on Saturday.

In the meeting at Town Hall on Friday, the EO announced that the proceedings would be carried on from the point where it were postponed last time.

He asked all those who wanted to vote for Ajai Mohan Chaudhary to raise their hands. This led to chaos in the House as BJP MLA Tikshan Sud asked the EO to read out the rules on whether elections could be started from the same point? He questioned under what provision of the Act was the EO conducting the election from the same point as recorded in the minutes.

While no tangible explanation was given, speculations were rife that after the last adjournment, new political alignments had taken place. While the 19 members wanted new proceedings, 12 demanded the proceedings to be carried from the same point.

Meanwhile, if elections are picked up from the same point, names of three persons have already been proposed.

5,SGPC general elections likely by Jan: Sekhon,"LUDHIANA: Chief commissioner, Gurdwara Election Commission, Jai Singh Sekhon on Friday said that much-delayed general elections of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) are likely to be held in December-end or January next year after completing process of revising electoral rolls.

Talking to newspersons at Circuit House here, Sekhon said the process of printing revised electoral rolls has been extended to May 30. The decision was taken during a meeting of the commission with deputy commissioners, additional deputy commissioners and supporting staff held here in this regard.

The date had to be extended in view of the inability expressed by the officers on various grounds to complete the process by due date, he said adding that May 5 was fixed as the last date.

Sekhon said that in absence of final decision on the voting rights of Sehajdhari Sikhs, they would be allowed to vote in accordance with existing provisions. Of about 58 lakh total registered voters up to February 28 this year, Sehajdharis comprise about seven lakh, he said while putting the number of â€˜â€˜keshdhariâ€™â€™ voters at about 50 lakh.

The elections due to held by October, 2001, were delayed for number of reasons. The major reason being preparation of revised electoral rolls due to which announcement of election date had been extended to enable more eligible voters to get registered, Sekhon said.

Another controversy related to the demand made by the SGPC regarding debarring the Sehajdharis from exercising franchise and reduction of age of the eligible voter from 21 to 18 years. Though the Union home ministry has decided to amend the law in this regard but the process is likely to take time hence the Sehajdharis would be allowed to vote in the coming election, Sekhon said.

Sekhon said that any person claiming eligibility has been allowed to appeal to the commission in the event of rejection by deputy commissioner or revising authority as applicable under Representation of Peoples Act. The matter was referred by the commission to the home ministry for making amendment of relevant rules with a view to remove any ambiguity regarding finality of revising authority, he said.

6,Water policy no boon for Bihar,"PATNA: Despite being a signatory to the new national water policy, the Bihar government is crying foul.

At a recent seminar organised by the Bihar legislative council, water resources minister Jagdanand Singh alleged that â€œinterlinking of water-surplus river basins with water-deficient basinsâ€� was not in the original draft of the new national water policy and that he had been tricked. RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav spoke of a conspiracy to deprive Bihar of its only natural resource â€” water â€” after the bifurcation of the state. He said he would like to go to jail for contempt of court rather than allowing any tampering with the water of Bihar rivers.

Apart from politics, experts have pointed to the ecological and environmental disaster Bihar may face due to the proposed interlinking of water basins of India. After the construction of Farakka barrage, the production of Hilsa, one of the most favoured fish, in the Bihar stretch of Ganga has gone down. Head of the department of zoology of Patna University Akhileshwari Nath has warned that â€œseveral species of fish and various medicinal plants may not survive in the artificial environment created by the interlinking.â€�

Maintaining that the interlinking would definitely affect the biodiversity of rivers and lakes in Bihar, he said several fish species found in the Kosi may become endangered. The high level of siltation in the Ganga in Bihar is already affecting fish production. If the river is connected with downstream rivers, the siltation rate is likely to increase, he added.

Experts said that Bihar would become even more vulnerable to earthquakes after the interlinking of river basins and that it would mean disturbance in the agricultural pattern. Noted expert on water resources T Prasad said it has not been taken into account that Bihar is at a very low level of water resource development, adding that interlinking per se is hardly a solution to its flood problem.

Though the politicians of Bihar are speaking of networking of rivers as an attempt to â€œtransfer droughtsâ€�, the state water resources department is talking of linking of sub-basins (rivers within basins) before going in for the interlinking of basins. It stresses the need for modification in the cropping pattern of water-deficient regions, adding that instead of trying to increase food production in water-deficient areas at a huge cost, efforts should be made to improve agricultural infrastructure in the water-surplus basins. It also stresses the need for caution in differentiating between the water-surplus and water-deficient areas on the basis of requirement of water during a considerable period of time.

The Prime Minister has called a meeting of all chief ministers in May to discuss the issue of interlinking of water basins. Bihar is likely to offer a strong resistance and question the wisdom of spending Rs 5,60,000 crore on the whole plan, even though it is a signatory to the new national water policy.

7,Water once in 5 days: minister,"DHARWAD: District incharge minister K.N. Gaddi on Friday said that drinking water to Hubli and Dharwad will be supplied once in five days. The new arrangement will come into force â€œshortlyâ€™â€™.

Speaking to reporters here after a meeting with officials and legislators, he said 15 million gallons of water per day will be pumped into the twin cities. It has been decided to draw 2 MGD of water from Neerasagar lake, which had been kept as reserve. Malaprabha reservoir will provide 12 MGD, while the borewells in Unkal and Neerasagar basins will provide half MGD each. Gaddi said the water available at Neearasagar lake would suffice for

60 days and Malaprabha reservoir had 2 tmcft water. The government had earlier decided not to release water from Neerasagar in order to cater to the needs in peak summer. The Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Board (KUWS&SB) has taken over the responsibility of distributing water to Hubli-Dharwad from April 1. He said 45 villages in the district were facing acute shortage of drinking water and arrangements were being made to provide it. Additional borewells would be sunk wherever necessary. Kalghatgi and Kundgol taluks were the worst hit, he added. He said 170 new borewells had been sunk in the district during the year, of which 12 were defunct.

Gaddi denied there was a nexus between borewell companies and officials and the public funds were going waste. On the strike by employees of Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation alleging delay in payment of salary, he said the strike was unjustified. â€œAction would be taken against the striking employees,â€™â€™ he warned. HDMC Commissioner Biradar said the employees felt the previous commissioner Naveen Raj Singh had kept aside Rs 1.8 crore for payment of salaries. â€œThis is not true,â€™â€™ he clarified.

8,HC fines state govt for delay,"PATNA: Justice R S Garg of the Patna High Court on Friday slapped a fine of Rs 2,000 on the state government for the delay in restoring gun to Vijay Kumar Patel, mukhia of Surhari gram panchayat under the Harnaut block of Nalanda district, after the death of previous mukhia Virendra Singh.

Taking the matter seriously, the single bench of the high court directed Nalanda district magistrate, who was present in the court, to return the gun to the present mukhia within 10 days of the order with renewed licence.

The DM made the plea that since there are a large number of licence-holders of arms in Nalanda district, the distribution of licensed arms to individuals requires verification, Justice Garg said that in view of the prevailing law and order situation in the state there is hardly any ground to deny licence to a mukhia.

""Everyday, when I open any daily I do not find it written in black and white. It is written in red. The daily is full of incidents of murder, loot, dacoity, kidnapping, snatching and so on and the readers get alarmed,"" he remarked.

Finding the court order of far-reaching importance, standing counsel Alamdar Hussain later sent a fax message to the Nalanda district magistrate requesting him to file a Letter Patent Appeal (LPA) without any delay.

Forest officer fined: In another case, Justice Garg slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 on the district forest officer of Banka as he failed to release the vehicle of one Neeraj Kumar Sinha despite the order of the Banka DM, who happended to be the appellate authority.

Bail granted: Justice Chandra Mohan Prasad of Patna High Court on Thursday granted bail to appellant Madan Paswan in the absence of any evidence against him that he had ever demanded any dowry from Meera Kumari. The appellant was the husband of deceased Meera Kumari, who had been convicted by the sessions court on October 17, 2001, and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years.

There was no eye witness and the witnesses examined were divided in their contentions before the single bench judge.

There were altogether four accused persons, including the appellant.

Three other accused persons have already been granted bail by the lower court. An FIR in this connection had been lodged by victim''s father Arjun Paswan in Bikram (Dulhin Bazar) police station.

The marriage was held on May 19, 1986, and the victim came to her in-laws'' house on February 14, 1989, where she died on March 7, 1989. Advocates Dwivedi Surendra and Ashok Kumar Singh appeared for the appellant.

9,Pardafaash rally: City has the blues,"LUCKNOW: Blue has turned out to be the colour of the season. With the Pardafaash rally of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) drawing near, party workers have left no stone unturned in pleasing chief minister Mayawati.

More than 100 hoardings in the state capital have been painted blue, with another 50 getting a fresh coat of blue. BSP workers seem hell bent on ensuring that their partyâ€™s presence is felt. The Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), responsible for hoardings in the city, chooses not to intervene in matters pertaining to state politics. When questioned whether the civic body would do anything about the â€˜blue menaceâ€™ sweeping the cityâ€™s roads and crossings, one LMC official quipped, â€œSher ke mooh mein kaun haath daale!â€�.

It is the advertising companies however, that have found themselves at the receiving end of the blue wave. According to the manager of an advertising firm that has been driven blue in the face by the â€˜blue waveâ€™, the company is staring significant losses right in the face. Refusing to be quoted, he said his clients had expressed extreme displeasure at the situation, and have asked the company to repaint the billboards with their advertisements once the rally is over. â€œRepainting 12 hoardings would cost us an arm and a leg,â€� he rued. Meanwhile, the obsession with blue shows no signs of letting up.

At Ambedkar rally sthal, the venue for the Pardafaash rally, every conceivable surface has suddenly been overtaken by a fit of the â€˜bluesâ€™. From humble taps, to the tents yet to be erected, blue seems to be the flavour of the rally.

10,Voices raised against rise in communal violence,"LUCKNOW: Citizens, activists, womens groups, and social organisations staged a protest at Patel Park here on Friday against continuing communal violence in the state. More than 200 people from various groups participated in the sit-in at the park.

The activists were protesting over the recent incidents of communal violence in Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Maharajganj and Shravasti districts. They decried the formation of â€˜Hindu Senaâ€™ by sitting MP Mahant Adityanath Yogi, who they alleged was spreading violence against the Muslims. They condemned the burning of houses of Muslims in Sharavasti and Gorakhpur districts.

Roop Rekha Verma, former vice-chancellor of Lucknow University lambasted the government for giving a free hand to communal forces to spread venom against minorities. â€œThe strategy of communalising and making weaker sections of the society struggle with each other is a way of keeping their political space intactâ€�, she said. Chittaranjan of Peopleâ€™s Union for Civil Liberties said that people like Adityanath who provoke religious frenzy and instigate violence should be given a strong reply. Subhasini Ali charged that the though the government in the state was led by BSP, the agenda being followed was that of BJP.

â€œTrishuls (tridents) are being distributed openly in special programmes, but the government is keeping mumâ€�, she remarked. In a memorandum given to the additional city magistrate, the protestors have demanded a ban on extremist Hindu organisations like VHP, Bajrang Dal and Hindu Yuva Vahini and also that action be taken against Adityanath who was responsible for inciting communal violence in Gorakhpur and Kushinagar. A high-level probe into communal violence and adequate compensation for riot victims was also demanded.

11,Kin of former MP arrested for breach of peace,"LUCKNOW: It was a blatant show of highhandedness by spoilt brats of high and mighty staged right in the middle of the main Hazratganj thoroughfare on Friday. That the son and the son-in-law of former Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian from Lucknow Poornima Verma were later arrested by the Hazratganj police was a rare end to such a sequence.

It was around 4:30 pm when two occupants of an Alto car (UP 32 AS 6000) entered into an argument with two youths riding a Yamaha motorcycle near Universal crossing. As the motorcyclist moved on, two more youths, Meesam Rizvi, a student of class 9 at the Oxford Public School and resident of Bajaja locality in the Old city and his friend Nadeem who were passing by the scene, arrived on the scene. Identifying themselves as the friends of the two youths with whom the car occupants were having an argument, Meesam objected when the occupants of the car, later identified as Abhishek Verma and Dr Sanjay Verma, began to abuse them. Abhishek is the son of Poornima Verma while Dr Sanjay is her son-in-law who had completed his MBBS MD from King George Medical College.

Even as the youth riding the Yamaha motorcycle left the scene, the focus of Vivek and Dr Sanjay shifted to Meesam. The two allegedly assaulted Meesam unprovoked. When a traffic constable, who was on duty at the site of the incident, tried to rescue a hapless Meesam, Dr Sanjay allegedly assaulted him as well. In the meantime a police sub inspector and constables arrived at the scene and took Abhishek, Dr Sanjay and Meesam away.

At the police station, after a patient hearing the three were booked under section 160 of the IPC (causing neausance at a public place). All the three were bailed out from the police station itself thereafter.

12,Power staff to protest against Electricty Bill,"LUCKNOW: Power employees and engineers all over the country will boycott work on April 7 against the Electricity Bill 2001. A comprehensive strategy by the state employees and engineers has also been drawn for opposing the move to sell Kesco to NTPC.

In a press statement, convenor of the Rajya Vidyut Abhiyanta Sangh, Shailendra Dubey stated that the call for the April 7 strike had been given by the National Coordination Committee of Electricity Employees and Engineers. Power employees all over the country will boycott work and hold demonstrations and dharnas. The Bill is to be introduced in the Lok Sabha on April 7. Following this, on April 24, power employees will stage a satyagrah in all districts from 10 am to 5 pm against the move to sell Kesco to NTPC. On April 29, they will boycott work and from 10 pm the same day proceed on a 24-hour token stike.

Dubey said the property of Kesco was valued at Rs 2000 crore while its book value was shown at Rs 273 crore. After handing 51 per cent share to NTPC Kesco would be handed to NTPC at Rs 135 crore. Dubey said the largesse does not merely stop at this. He said after this, the state government will give Rs 283 crore to NTPC for system improvement of Kanpur city.

This way Kesco would be handed virtually free to NTPC. He has questioned why this amount was not given by the government to Kesco during the past three years. Dubey said the unions have decided that if Kesco was handed to NTPC then the employees including the engineers and junior enginmeers would proceed on strike.

13,Konda Surekha hits back at govt,"HYDERABAD: Congress MLA Konda Surekha, who is facing charges under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota), challenged the state government on Friday to furnish any evidence it had of her association with the Peopleâ€™s War and her involvement in a conspiracy to kill her political rival, TDP legislator E Dayakar Rao.

Surekha and her husband Murali, who too has been charged under Pota, addressed a press conference in the city on Friday and blamed Dayakar Rao for â€œforcingâ€� the police to frame a false case against them. â€œA Pota case has been slapped on us on the basis of a mere confession by a person in police custody,â€™â€™ Surekha said, hinting at a larger conspiracy by TDP leaders of Warangal district. The Congress MLA from Shayampet said police extracted the confessional statement from G Mahipal Reddy, a close associate of her husband.

She also refuted the police version that Mahipal Reddy was arrested on Thursday. â€œOn summons from the Hanmakonda circle inspector Ghulam Samdhani, I handed over him to the police on March 24. He was illegally detained for 10 days,â€™â€™ she said. Surekha defended her presence at the funeral of the Peopleâ€™s War leader P Sudarshan Reddy alias RK who was killed in an encounter with the police last fortnight. â€œI attend the funerals of many people in my constituency. RK was also from my area and hence I felt it fit to attend his funeral,â€™â€™ she said.

Warangal range DIG T Krishna Prasad, however, said Surekha, her husband, RK and 15 others figured as accused in the case, framed following the confession of Mahipal Reddy. He said Mahipal had informed the police that the MLA and her husband solicited naxalite help in eliminating Dayakar Rao.

But, the Congress came out in defence of Surekha and her husband and demanded withdrawal of the case. PCC president M Satyanarayana Rao said the TDP was trying to harass Congressmen and the chief minister himself was a party to this ploy. Home minister T Devender Goud denied this accusation and said the government would investigate the matter thoroughly.

14,"India, Pakistan clash in UN over terrorism","UNITED NATIONS: India and Pakistan clashed in the Security Council after New Delhi described Islamabad as ""epicenter of terrorism"" and charged it with not living up to its commitments to the international community and the United Nations to stop cross-border terrorism.

In a firm statement on Friday, India''s UN Ambassador Vijay Nambiar demanded that the Council''s Counter Terrorism Committee (CTC) identify the countries that violate its resolutions aimed at countering terrorism.

Nambiar did not name Pakistan, describing it in his entire presentation as ""one country"" but the reference was so obvious that Pakistan Ambassador Munir Akram took floor to deny charges of terrorism against his country.

The clash came as the Council was discussing threats to international peace caused by terrorism.

Nambiar specifically referred the recent massacre of 24 Kashmiri Pandits, including 11 women and two children, by Pakistan trained terrorists, and said their objective was ""selective cleansing"" through mass murder, an objective, he said, they have pursued all along.

Pointing out that the incident has been condemned across the world, he told the Council that what has gone unnoticed is the ""tremendous restraint and composure"" displayed by the government and various communities in India in ""not being provoked to reacting disproportionately to this event.""

Such a reaction, he said, is possible in ""situation like this one that inflames religious and communal passions around the country."" But by behaving maturely, ""our common people have responded wisely to the latest terrorist outrage.""

15,Iraqis resist as they hate foreign rule: Arab scribe,"NEW DELHI: The resistance that the coalition forces face at almost every step in Iraq is not because of any love for President Saddam Hussein, but because the Iraqis hate a colonial power ruling over them again, a senior Arab journalist returning from the battlefield has said.

Waifi Awwad, a Syrian journalist based here, who went missing in Iraq while covering the war, said this after returning to his base.

Awwad was ambushed by Iraqis in the city of Zubair, north of Basra, when he went out to shoot for his network after being assured by the coalition forces that the area was under their control and it was safe to move around there. He only managed to escape with some local help on March 30.

""It is true that the Iraqi people have suffered a lot under the regime of Saddam Hussein and people are scared to talk openly against him,"" he said but added ""Iraqis have had a very bad experience with the British colonial regime and given a choice between the two evils, they would definitely choose Saddam.""

Recounting his experiences to relieved friends and well-wishers last night, Awwad said he was captured because the Iraqi fighters, who were in civilian clothes, mistook him for a Caucasian because of his attire and physical appearance.

When he said that he was an Arab, he was scolded for moving around with the Americans and the British, who were considered invaders.

""You should be fighting a jehad against the coalition forces,"" he was told to which he replied ""My jehad is my camera and my mike.""

Awwad said the Iraqi authorities considered him a traitor the punishment for which was death in Iraq.

Referring to the period of his captivity, Awwad said he was interrogated by a tribal leader for two hours but was generally looked after well by his captors. Awwad said he saw a great fighting spirit in the Iraqi people. ""People came from all over to know how they can fight the coalition troops who had much superior ammunition. The rewards that the regime gave for killing enemy soldiers and downing their planes obviously helped.""

He also said that the coalition forces tended to provide a lower than actual casualty figure on their troops. ""During my period of captivity I saw the Iraqis kill 20 British soldiers out of which only two were acknowledged.""

Related to this was the issue of ''embedded journalists'' who move around with the various fighting units. ""They are only given the coalition''s version of developments and have to follow strict rules about what they can shoot and what they can''t,"" Awwad said.

Moreover, they had to get their tapes cleared by the authorities before they could air anything, he said.

There is a big human catastrophe unfolding in Iraq and there are a lot of people fleeing from the cities, Awwad said.

Referring to the many Iraqi civilians killed because the coalition troops could not distinguish a soldier from a civilian, he said ""if the British and the Americans don''t win the confidence of the local population, there would be more casualties.""

The physical infrastructure and the communication network in the country have collapsed, he said, adding that the B-52 bombers deal a devastating blow to the psyche of the people. It would take a long time to rebuild it, he added.

16,NSCN (I-M) rules out surrender of arms,"KOHIMA: The NSCN (I-M) has ruled out surrender of arms ahead of the next round of dialogue expected to be held abroad between the organisation''s leadership and the Centre''s special emissary K Padmanabhaiah later this month.

Expressing regrets that ""irresponsible utterances"" from the Central government representative were still persisting, the NSCN (I-M) leadership in a statement on Friday said, ""it would be unfortunate for all if the atmosphere which was already essentially conducive to the process, was vitiated.""

""It should be remembered imposition in any manner from either side will not work,"" the statement said.

NSCN (I-M) alleged despite their statement on January 24, 2003, wherein they hoped ""the Government of India would appreciate the Naga''s sincerity, their firmness in their commitment to the process and their modesty, the Indian government has tended to presume upon it and is indiscreetly pushing towards arms surrender.""

The statement said the Government of India should know it was not the ""time anymore to talk about the Indo-Naga issue out of turn,"" but to take a bold decision.

They also reminded the Government of its solemn commitment that it would, ""not talk with any group except the NSCN"" and warned that ""failure to honour the commitment may therefore be disastrous, nay, it may bring end of everything.""

Meanwhile, the Centre''s special emissary K Padmanabhaiah said earlier this week in New Delhi that the question of laying down of arms would arise only when a ""final settlement"" was reached.""

19,BJP asks state govts to talk to traders on VAT,"INDORE: Washing its hands off the VAT issue agitating the minds of the traders in the country, BJP on Saturday urged state governments to enter into a dialogue with the business community to remove their misunderstandings and make amendments in the legislation, if necessary.

In an apparent bid to placate its vote base among the trading community, the party adopted a special resolution at its National Executive here on Saturday.

It asserted that ""the very concept of VAT was initiated during the Congress regime and majority of all state governments belonging to all political parties had accepted it voluntarily. It is blatantly wrong to suggest that Central Government or BJP had forced this legislation on state governments"".

Taking note of the widespread resentment and misunderstandings in the minds of the business community, the resolution said ""VAT is a state legislation replacing sales tax, which is again primarily a state subject. State governments belonging to all political parties have legislated VAT without Union Government''s coercion"".

Pointing out that the BJP government in Gujarat had already entered into a dialogue with the business community, the National Executive urged state governments to enter into similar talks ""so as to remove their misunderstandings and also make amendments in the legislations if any"".

21,Govt should implement pro-poor economic policy: BJP,"INDORE: With coming Assembly elections in four key states in view, the BJP on Saturday asked the Vajpayee government to implement a distinctive pro-poor economic policy, providing free foodgrains to destitutes and expanding Antyodaya Anna Yojana to include 50 lakh more ""very poor"" families than covered by the Union Budget.

In a resolution passed in its national executive meeting here, the BJP also demanded more employment generation as compared to creation of over 1 crore jobs projected in the Union Budget for 2003-04, besides implementing the promised Rs 60,000 crore infrastructure projects, including inter-linking of rivers, with ""alacrity"".

25,AP govt may withdraw Pota against Cong MLA,"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh government may withdraw the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) case lodged against Congress MLA Konda Surekha and her husband Murali. Both were allegedly linked to the banned Peopleâ€™s War.

Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and home minister T Devender Goud on Saturday called a meeting of senior officials to discuss the issue and decided that Pota shall be invoked only against extremists.

Official sources told The Times of India that the chief minister and the home minister were not informed of the police decision to book the Congress MLA and her husband under Pota.

The decision to use Pota against Surekha was apparently taken by the deputy inspector-general of police (Warangal range) and announced without the assent of the government. The officer was said to be acting under pressure from some local politicians.

Naidu and Goud reportedly felt the case against Surekha should be dropped. However, the government was of the view that the MLA and her husband could be booked under provisions of the IPC and the Arms Act.

The government also decided to limit the use of Pota only against extremists. The chief minister and home minister recalled that the Telugu Desam Party had opposed Pota and wanted safeguards embedded in the Bill when introduced in Parliament.
