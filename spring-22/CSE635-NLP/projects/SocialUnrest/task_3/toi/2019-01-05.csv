0,Bank argues small farmers' case,"hyderabad: even as the state government groans under a subsidy of over rs 1,500 crore on supplying power at nominal rates to farmers, the world bank has expressed the view that the small and marginal farmers of andhra pradesh are paying a bit too much for electricity. in a document titled india power supply to agriculture — andhra pradesh case study (report no. 22171-in), the bank says these farmers are paying a higher price than revealed by the state's power utility. the poor quality of power supply, the bank says, is adding to farmers' costs on account of various factors including frequent motor burnouts, interruptions due to transformer burnouts, unscheduled power cuts which erode crop yields. however, the document also recommends a hike in tariff for power supplied to the farm sector as the current charges are inadequate to recover costs.the present tariff in the state, based on a flat rate structure, is regressive and is penalising marginal and small farmers who are using less electricity for a given connected capacity, the document says. referring to the anti-power tariff hike struggle a year and a half ago, the document says efforts to rectify the anomaly have already caused political turbulence in the state. nevertheless, because the tariff the farmers pay represents only about 4.5 per cent of the average cost of power supply, it results in a significant burden on the finances of utilities, it says. the bank suggested that adopting measures to improve electricity supply conditions would increase the acceptability of a power tariff hike. though six months have passed since the bank's recommendations were forwarded to the government, no proposal for a tariff hike has yet been mooted by transco and the power distribution companies to the ap electricity regulatory commission nor has the issue figured in any of the meetings of transco. this, according to senior officials, was due to the fear of a political fallout of such a hike.transco and the distribution companies have instead focussed on improving the quality of supply to farmers as it would go a long way in reducing the overheads incurred by them on account of frequent motor burnouts and other related problems. moreover, we see power supply to the farm sector as a social obligation and it cannot be treated on the commercial lines. in view of this,we are in the process of educating farmers on various issues including power consumption and crop pattern which will improve their yield besides conserving energy, a senior official said. on the issue of a tariff hike, the official said it was for the government to take a decision which would then have to be ratified by the aperc.

1,BJP seeks arrest of Sheikhpura carnage accused,"patna: the leader of opposition in the state assembly sushil kumar modi on thursday demanded immediate arrest of congress mp rajo singh and his son and former minister of state sanjay singh, mla, in connection with the sheikhpura incident in which nine persons, including the district rjd chief kashi yadav and district board member anil mahto were killed on december 26. he also demanded immediate sacking of minister of state for jail ashok chaudhary from his post. modi, who led a fact-finding delegation of the party to sheikhpura, told newsmen on his return here that it was surprising that the rabri devi government was soft-pedalling the whole issue even as all the nine deceased, including the sheikhpura rjd chief, belonged to backward castes. he said that the killing of the sheikhpura district rjd chief kashi yadav was a big challenge to the rabri government since it indicated that even the senior ruling party leaders were no longer safe. bjp legislator vinod yadav and president of the intellectual cell of the party suraj nandan prasad were the other members of party's fact-finding team. the bjp leaders criticised the chief minister for not visiting sheikhpura. while maintaining that the incident was the result of the cold war going on between sanjay and minister of state for jail ashok chaudhary for last few months, modi said that laloo had extended patronage to both the congress leaders for political considerations. he alleged that laloo did not want rajo and sanjay to be arrested since he wanted to create rift between backward and forward castes for political reasons. laloo stands to gain politically from the rift between sanjay and ashok, he added. modi alleged that laloo was protecting rajo since the latter was also a fodder scam accused. he said that let alone arresting rajo and sanjay, the police was yet to arrest any of the named accused of the carnage. modi maintained that laloo had of late started promoting ashok chaudhary, son of veteran congress leader and former minister mahavir chaudhary, to cut rajo down to size.

3,Peace offer to PWG will not dilute terror law,"new delhi: the piquant situation between the centre and andhra pradesh over the state's decision to hold talks with the extremist organisation - the people's war group - has been attributed by home ministry officials to the state government's ""prerogative"" to manage law and order. the pwg was banned under the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) two months ago, rendering all its activities and affiliated organisations illegal. however, chief minister chandrababu naidu has offered to hold negotiations with the pwg, thereby undermining the centre's writ. home ministry officials say banning an organisation does not bar the government from exploring democratic avenues like negotiations to settle the dispute or grievances. asked whether the ap government's move reflects the failure of poto in curbing the left violence in the state, the officials said ""no"". the state has not been ""compelled"" to take recourse to negotiations. the officials point that in the north-east too several extremist organisations, like the national socialist council of nagaland (isak-muivah) group and all factions associated with it, have been banned yet the centre is negotiating and holding peace talks with nscn (i-m). officials agree that the state government has to tackle the continuously escalating violence of the pwg, which has struck deep and wide roots in the rural areas of the state. the influence and support base of pwg makes it necessary for the state to find any avenue to bring peace and normalcy to the state, they say. the state's offer of negotiations with the pwg, thus, does not come in conflict with the centre's decision to outlaw the left organisation, they stress.

4,Jail unrest exposes deeper rot,"kolkata: last week's agitation by prisoners at midnapore jail gave a peek at a widespread rot in the jail administration in west bengal. about 300 inmates — mostly convicts — went on a hunger strike for several days protesting against the death of a fellow-prisoner serving a life sentence. it took prolonged negotiations by senior officials including deputy inspector general (prisons) dipak chowdhury, who camped there, to make them give up, after 10 of them were hospitalised. a fact-finding team of the midnapore branch of the association for protection of democratic rights has revealed that there were bigger issues involved in the episode which must be addressed in order to prevent such situation in future. the prisoners were right, according to apdr, in alleging that the death of the lifer was a result of official negligence. the youth — in his thirties — had a cardiac arrest and complained of chest pain early in the morning. it took nearly three hours for a doctor to attend to him, and all the doctor could do was refer him to the midnapore sadar hospital. locating the ambulance driver and removing him to the hospital took some more time, and eventually, he reached there dead. more than individual callousness, this negligence seemed to have been the result of the system of jail administration. three doctors work part-time on contract as visiting physicians at the jail hospital, and in case of an emergency, there is no way one can get quick help. the first thing we are demanding is a full-time resident doctor in the jail, apdr midnapore branch secretary dipak basu told tnn. but there is another part of the story. the death due to negligence, the findings indicated, provided the immediate pretext for a vested interest group to take it out on the jail superintendent, panchanan biswas. the reason: the superintendent, who had joined only a few months ago, had checked a racket in medicines for the prisoners. from rs 2.5 lakh, the monthly expenses on medicines had come down to about rs 1 lakh. most of the medicines that were requisitioned, according to sources, were of little use to the inmates and somehow found their way to the market outside. curbing this racket had angered a section of the jail staff and their pet convicts. recalling that even the west bengal human rights commission, in its latest report, had deplored corruption in the state's jails, basu said that it was time the authorities woke up to such malpractice in prisons. that, however, requires political will, and there is no guarantee that it will be forthcoming. for, sources say, the situation at midnapore jail was complicated further by a political shadow fighting between two partners of the ruling left front. it could not have gone to that extent had not the jail staff unions controlled by the rsp and the cpm taken sides in the tussle.

5,Pak modernisers can help arrest extremist trends,"new delhi: after 73 years, communism finally collapsed inward because of the contradictions generated within it by global containment. the soviet union lasted that long because of its enormous resources, its military prowess and advanced technology in areas like nuclear energy and outer space. in the light of this experience, it should not be difficult to contain pakistan, to induce in it a controlled chain reaction which would reverse its extremist trends and incorporate it into the international system as a moderate state. therefore, the present alliance against terrorism should coordinate its activities to apply adequate pressure to generate the requisite changes within pakistani society, utilising those elements which favour pakistan's incorporation into the global liberal democratic order. unlike the soviet union, iran, iraq and libya — all of which had adequate domestic economic resources to withstand external pressure, pakistan does not have any such capability. pakistani extremism was mostly built up in the 1970s and '80s after oil riches enabled extremism to be used as an instrument of foreign policy by saudi arabia. subsequently, the us followed during the anti-soviet afghan war. religious extremism is to be distinguished from the arab-israeli issue and iranian nationalism. for geo-economic and geo-political reasons, the us was permissive of the activities of saudi arabia and pakistan. the narcotics financing of extremist activities also began during the afghan war. now the us had to pay the price for its past follies and lead the alliance against terrorism generated by fanatical religious extremism. once the us and its industrial allies join their efforts in containing the pakistan-based and saudi-induced extremism, in this information age it is not difficult to trigger off the societal changes necessary to purge these societies of extremism. iran integrating with the rest of the world is progressively shedding its extremism. in the case of pakistan, that would mean giving up the two-nation theory and adopting a secular approach in its international relations. pakistan can be made to accept this, just as jinnah had to accept what he termed as ""moth eaten pakistan"". without giving up the two-nation theory and its claim to kashmir on that basis, pakistan will not be able to get rid of extremism and terrorism. given its international debt and economic dependence on other states, it is well within the capability of the alliance against terrorism to bring this about. however in doing this, a long-term plan of applying steady and sustained containment should be evolved with due care so that the transformation is carried out essentially by pakistanis themselves. it is in this respect that people like general musharraf and other modernisers within pakistan are likely to have the potential to be useful. to bring this about, india, the us, the european union and russia should start coordinated planning at this stage.

7,Teachers slam reveal-all rule,"kolkata: all bengal state government college teachers' association criticised the left front government for making it mandatory for college and university teachers to give quarterly declarations that they would not engage in private tuition. we are opposing the new system besides supporting the ban on private tuition. it will be unfair and arbitrary to compel senior and reputed teachers to give such declarations, said benoy bhushan chakraborty, president of the association. he felt that most of the senior teachers would refuse to give such 'derogatory' declarations and that senior college teachers wanted to file a defamation suit if they were forced to give the declaration. the association urged the state government on friday to rescind its decision and abolish the act regarding the declaration. earlier the state government announced that the payment of salaries act meant for college and university teachers as well as universities act are likely to be amended in order to implement the ban on private tuition by the teachers of government run and aided colleges. the ban took effect from january 2002. while announcing the ban, state higher education minister satyasadhan chakraborty said that all teachers would have to furnish a declaration pledging that he would not be involved in private tuition for monetary gain. the association accused the left front government of introducing various wrong policies in the education system of the state for the past 25 years. it had also appointed teachers, principals and vice-chancellors with political motivation. now the state government is trying to blame the teachers for its failures, said benoy chakraborty.

8,New health policy to focus on rural India: Thakur,"lucknow: union minister for health and family welfare dr c p thakur has said that a new health policy is being prepared for providing better medical and health care facilities in rural india. it would be implemented from april this year under the tenth five year plan. talking to the times news network, thakur said that the central government was also considering a proposal to set up a body on the pattern of the university grants commission, which would provide grants to the medical colleges all over the country and help in standardising medical education. he said that as an alternative, a central medical university could be set up for this purpose. he said that a new policy to encourage indian system of medicines, including ayurveda, siddha and unani systems, besides homoeopathy, naturopathy and yoga, was in the offing. he said that integration of the indian systems with allopathy would also be done, for which changes would be made in the syllabi of the medical colleges. thakur said that research on geno-studies would now be encouraged and medicines would be based more on them. he said that to encourage research in this field, rs. 1000 crore would be sanctioned to different medical institutions through indian council of medical research (icmr). he underlined the need of developing expertise in genomics, protonomics and bio-informatics, for which the syllabi of the medical colleges would have to be amended. thakur, who was here in connection with the indian science congress, said that most of the primary health centres and sub centres all over the country, specially in the northern india, were not functioning properly. he said that under the new health policy, the central government would provide medicines and other facilities at sub centres, phcs and district hospitals. he said that about 55 per cent of the total budget allocation on medical and health of the central and the state governments would be spent on it. he said that it was an irony that at present about 90 per cent of the total budget allocation in the states was being spent on establishments, leaving very little scope for medicines and other facilities. the minister said that even some of the reputed medical colleges were not in good shape at present. he said that during last two decades great advancements had been made in instrumentations and costly medical equipment had been developed. he said that medical colleges would be provided with such equipment. thakur said that population control programme could succeed only if the infant and maternal mortality rates could be reduced drastically. he said that infant mortality rate was 72 per thousand, mostly due to neo-natal mortality and lack of expertise to provide necessary care to newly born child. it had been decided to provide better delivery facilities in rural areas for which hiring of doctors, para-medical staff, anms and anaesthetics on contract basis would be allowed to cope up with the demands. in rural areas, where proper facilities were not available, a well equipped mobile van would be provided to shift the patient to a place where better facilities were available.

15,Indian Tea Association asks govt to reduce tax,"guwahati: the assam branch of the indian tea association (abita) has urged the state government to reduce agricultural income tax for tea gardens in view of the ongoing crisis in the industry. addressing a press conference here on friday night, abita chairman k.r. bhagat said that the agriculture income tax should be reduced to the level of the central corporate income tax rate of 35 per cent to enable the tea industry to generate more resources needed for investment and growth. voicing serious concern at the decline in the price of tea in the world market, the abita chairman said that it would adversely affect tea producers throughout the country and of assam in particular. urging chief minister tarun gogoi to help the industry by curtailing escalation of the input costs that were under the purview of the state and central governments, bhagat said that the tea industry in assam in particular was passing through a severe crisis in view of the hike in cost of production, labour wages and adverse weather conditions. given the decline in price realisation of tea globally and the hike in input costs domestically, he said, the high social welfare measure costs and low rate of return had also adversely hit the industry. with the crisis further compounded by the arrival of cheaper tea in the world market produced by countries such as sri lanka, kenya and china, the captains of the tea industry were contemplating to market the brand names of indian tea in the world market by stressing on its quality. the tea industry was also contemplating to target a 'huge market' in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and installation of a friendly government there. considering the weather conditions in afghanistan, the abita chief said, tea consumption level there was very high offering a very substantial market for indian tea. underling certain remedies to help the crisis ridden tea industry, bhagat said, there should be immediate regularisation of land under tea by all growers and framing of river and flood management schemes to save the tea growing areas from erosion. he further said that aviation and telecommunication facilities should be improved in the remote tea garden areas and international trade routes opened for expansion of trade and commerce in the north east region.

16,Civic polls: Congmen have the last laugh,"raichur: all 35 councillors of the raichur city municipal council (cmc) who were in a slumber from the time that they were elected, (ie may 4, 2001) seem to have woken up to reality. or so it seems. after the elections were held to elect the president and vice-president of the raichur cmc, the congress, it appears, has proved its mettle. though there were some differences brewing within the party, its members were elected as the vice-president. also, a woman was elected as the council chief. while it was a victory of sorts for the congress, it was a hard pill to swallow for mp a. venkatesh nayak and raichur mla syed yasin. for sometime, congress members had differences over the nomination of candidates for the council elections. however, all differences were resolved when it came to party support for the candidates. during campaigning and while nomination papers were being submitted by the respective candidates for the seat of president and vice-president, almost all congress workers turned up to show their support for the chosen candidate. the president's seat was reserved for a woman candidate and the vice-president's post was reserved for the scheduled caste. after the council elections were declared, out of 13 independent candidates, 10, including two women councillors joined the congress on may 12.

20,Vote divide in BMC polls to help Sena-BJP: Bhujbal,"mumbai: the division of secular votes in the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) polls scheduled for february 10 will help the ruling shiv sena-bjp alliance to recapture the civic body, deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal stated here on saturday. ``i had suggested that the congress and the ncp, which are already sharing power in the state, should jointly contest the polls. i was hoping that the congress would accept my suggestion. instead, certain congress leaders began attacking me,'' he said. the city unit of the congress had earlier decided to contest the 227 seats on its own. but after mr bhujbal put forward his proposal for a tie-up, a section of the congress wanted the party to revise its earlier decision. chief minister vilasrao deshmukh, who belongs to the congress, is also in favour of an understanding with the ncp. but a vocal segment of the congress led by gurudas kamat has insisted that the decision should not be altered. several leaders made representations to congress president sonia gandhi, who declined to intervene and said that she had left it to the local unit of the party to take whatever decision it deemed fit. the entire exercise has exposed the deep faultlines in the congress in mumbai. factionalism has come to the fore as never before. it is likely to intensify when the list of candidates is finalised.
