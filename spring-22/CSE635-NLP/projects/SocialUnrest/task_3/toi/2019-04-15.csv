0,‘New industrial policy soon’,"patna: the proposed new industrial policy (nip) of the state will have both pre-production and post-production incentives for the new small scale industries (ssis). the nip will come into effect by the end of may this year, according to industries minister vishwa mohan sharma. the nip is being drafted incorporating the recommendations of the industries commission headed by j j irani. a high-level committee headed by development commissioner d p maheshwari has held several rounds of meeting in this connection. a couple of other high-level meetings will be held this month before final preparation of the draft nip for its adoption by may end, said a senior industries department official. the pre-production incentives include 25 per cent exemption on the cost of land in the governmentâ€™s industrial area and growth centres to be charged from entrepreneurs going to launch the new ssi units. there will be 25 per cent exemption of stamp duty for the launching of new industries in the industrial areas and growth centres. the post-production incentives include diesel generating sets for captive power plants for the new industries, sharma added. the proposed policy will not give total exemption of sales tax or deferment of sales tax to the new ssi units as provided in the 1995-2000 industrial policy. this is so because a meeting of all the finance ministers of different states had decided against this. keeping this in view, the proposed nip envisages only 30 per cent pay back (return) of the annual sales tax deposited by the new units to the government. the other post-production incentives include exemption of 25 per cent with a maximum limit of rs 75,000 on the cost incurred for creating project report for the new units. the incentives will be valid for five years, the minister said. the nip has a proposal for quality certification for quality control of the products of the new ssi units. the 1995-2000 industrial policy lapsed on august 31, 2000. from september 1, 2000, small entrepreneurs of the state were in utter confusion as in the absence of the industrial policy, no fresh incentives to new industries could be given. the state government, however, tried to soothe the industrialists, and in january this year, extended the 1995-2000 industrial policy with retrospective effect from september 1, 2000. but under the extended policy, there is no provision for exemption of sales tax or deferment of sales tax for the new ssi units launched after september 1, 2000, said the president of bihar industries association (bia), k p s kesri.

3,Don't allow polls: Fact-finding team,"ahmedabad: a team of the people''s union for democratic rights (pudr) that visited gujarat has appealed to the election commission (ec) not to allow snap polls in the state and demanded a cbi probe into the riots. a 10-member team of pudr, which has to its credit a number of fact-finding missions including the one during the 1984 riots in new delhi, visited the rural areas of gujarat between april 5 and 13. talking to tnn at the end of the tour on sunday, the team convenor shashi saxena said they visited panchmahals, dahod, mehsana, sabarkantha, kheda and anand districts and ahmedabad city. pudr demanded that the probe into major incidents of killings and destruction be handed over to the cbi. the team will submit its final report to the national human rights commission. the interim report of the team released here said ""the fact that in some places law enforcement agencies could effectively prevent the occurrence of carnage shows that it was possible to control the post-godhra violence from assuming such horrendous proportions. therefore the abdication of responsibility by the state machinery in other places of gujarat must be held as the single most important reason for the carnage."" the team alleged that the scale and the nature of the incidents clearly indicate that they were the result of systematic planning, proceeding for at least six months. godhra was, according the team, just a catalyst and not the cause of what followed. giving examples of police excesses, the team said while most of the perpetrators of crime were from the majority community, a number of arrests were from the minority community. they gave an example of how 65 muslims were arrested for alleged demolition of a mosque in the gazipurwada area of nadiad.

5,Anil Biswas unaware of Dulal arrest,"kolkata: cpm state secretary anil biswas on sunday claimed he was ignorant of the details of the arrest of dulal banerjee, the cpm strongman from dum dum accused of masterminding the lynching of two youths. biswas said he was yet to receive any report from his partyâ€™s district committee on banerjee. â€œthe police arrested him (dulal) on a particular charge. it may be true or false. i am yet to receive any report from the district or lower committees. some local party leaders said that the charges were baseless.we would take steps once the state committee comes to know the details of the facts,â€� said biswas. he also declined to seek any explanation from local mla and citu leader rajdeo goala who had supported banerjee and blasted the police for arresting him. banerjee and his mentorâ€™s followers went ber-serk blocking roads and rail and forcing a shutdown in protest against the â€œpolice high-handednessâ€�. while denying that banerjeeâ€™s arrest was impossible without a nod from the top, biswas seemed to be more busy in balancing between his image as a clean leader and accommodating the interests of local satraps of the party. banerjee has been accused of murder as well as running a parallel administration and a huge extortion racket. however, the two-member party commission probing the lynching incident has failed to interrogate him so far. â€œthe party commission cannot interrogate him at lalbazar. unless he is heard, no report can be filed. and we will take decision on the basis of the party report only,â€� maintained biswas. nevertheless, he refused to see any â€œconfusionâ€� among the people about the leadershipâ€™s position on the arrest. â€œthe people know and trust the party.they know well that the dictatorship of the proletariat has not been established,â€� he quipped. while some observers found his ambivalence a â€œtacticalâ€� stance preparing grounds for purges at the â€œright timeâ€�, others pointed to the leadershipâ€™s vulnerability to the local pressures.

13,Principals want revamp in college admissions,"new delhi: this one is for parents and children alike: already getting the heebie-jeebies thinking about college admission? well, it won't be for long. if leading principals have their way, the class 10 board examination will soon be treated as the college pre-application eligibility test. once their results are through, students can apply to colleges of their choice, enclosing their marks and their resumes. colleges will then finally offer admissions based on the class 12 exam results, the resumes and essays of intent. this, according to the educationists — among them abha adams, director, the shri ram schools, delhi, and jyotsna brar, principal, welham girls', dehra dun — will be a better alternative than the proposed central college admission test which will probably mean the end of school boards. the principals, who met at a recent seminar organised jointly by bishop cotton school, shimla and st stephen's college, new delhi, are also proposing that schools return to holding board exams in december which will allow children the luxury of a gap year and time to prepare for life after school. others such as neil o'brien, chairman of the council for the indian school certificate examinations, suggested that there be better coordination between school boards while leena aparajit, also of the shri ram school, said school boards have to be flexible enough to allow a change of subject between class 11 and class 12. amrita dass, director of the indian institute for career studies, lucknow, had an entirely different perspective. as dass said: ''roughly 50 per cent of students in the age group 6-15 get some school education but only 6 per cent of these go in for tertiary education. it is necessary to see how we can accommodate more in this sector.'' this can only happen with a massive liberalisation of education, just as ''we've had in the economy''. otherwise, added dass, many students would continue to choose a profession too early and ''be stuck for life''. shomie das, former headmaster, doon school, dehra dun, agreed that all schools need to train the children for tertiary education while st stephen's college principal, anil wilson, bemoaned the ''trivialisation'' of college education because of cat and other competitive examinations. ''what is more,'' he said, ''students do not have their fundamentals clear so the iims suffer, colleges suffer and education suffers.'' adams echoed this, pointing out that ''we are in danger of losing a generation if our prescribed syllabi and theories continue to be different from the world in which our children live''.

""initial investment in any hardware manufacturing base runs into rs 5000-10,000 crore. so with a long gestation period where immediate return is not there, companies may seek that kind of tax holidays"", sources added.
