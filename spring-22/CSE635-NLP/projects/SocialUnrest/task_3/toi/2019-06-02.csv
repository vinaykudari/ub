Balram Singh, constable in the DRDO, was arrested on Friday night by the sleuths of Special Cell, the sources said, claiming that sensitive defence documents were recovered from him.

Singh had gone to a cyber cafe in Vasant Kunj in south Delhi to obtain print-out from a floppy, they said. The cyber cafe owner got suspicious and informed the police and he was arrested.

The floppy contained ""classified"" and ""sensitive"" documents relating to the Indian military, the sources said.

He is being interrogated to ascertain whom the documents were to be delivered to, they said.

Singh''s arrest came just hours after a former IAF officer Naresh Kumar was arrested while he was taking money from a Pakistan High Commission staffer Aamir Sabir for allegedly passing on sensitive information.

Sabir was later handed over to the external affairs ministry for initiating proceedings to declare him persona non grata.

4,BJP demands cancellation of by-elections,"PATNA: A seven-member BJP delegation led by the leader of Opposition in the legislative council Ganga Prasad and chief whip of the party in the state assembly Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha on Saturday submitted a memorandum to the returning officer-cum-subdivisional officer (SDO) of Danapur demanding cancellation of Danapur by-elections alleging rigging of the bypolls by the ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) with the help of the local administration.The BJP spokesperson Kiran Ghai said that the party workers would stage dharna at the income-tax (IT) roundabout from 10 am on Sunday if the Election Commission (EC) did not cancel the by-polls by Sunday morning.

5,Cramped between scarce funds and govt apathy,"PATNA: Notwithstanding the fact that Urdu happens to be the second official language of the state, Bihar Urdu Academy, the sole institution for developing Urdu language and literature, is on verge of closure, thanks to the apathetic attitude of the state government. The staff and officers of the academy are starving due to non-payment of their salaries for the last 13 months and all its activities are standstill due to paucity of funds.

Having as many as 32 staff on its roll, the academy needs a sum of at least Rs 32 lakh per annum to meet its establishment cost. But it receives a grant of Rs 20 lakh only from the state government, hampering its academic activities and causing irregular payment of salaries to the academy staff. Interestingly, the chief minister is the chairperson of the academy, who has not attended even a single meeting of during the last one decade.

On March 28, 1998, leaders of all political parties, during a discussion on the call attention motion in the Bihar Legislative Council, had demanded raising of the academyâ€™s annual grant to the Rs 1 crore to ensure its smooth functioning. The government had accepted the proposal and sanctioned a sum of Rs 70 lakh to the academy for the financial year 1998-99. But, without any rhyme or reason, the grant was reduced to Rs 10 lakh during 1999-2000. In the last financial year, it received a grant of Rs 20 lakh.

Drastic curtailment of government grants in the recent years has adversely affected the working of the academy. Publication of a bi-monthly magazine Zaban O Adab and monthly Khabarnama was stopped two years back. No book has been published by the academy for the last several years, says secretary Rizwan Ahmad.

The academy was set up with much fanfare in 1972 following a resolution of the state government in the light of the recommendation of the Gujral Committee. Bihar happens to be the second state (next only to Uttar Pradesh), where such an academy was set up to promote Urdu language and literature. Today, 15 such academies are functioning in different states of the country. While the academy in Andhra Pradesh receives a government grant of Rs 3 crore per annum, the one in Delhi gets Rs 1.70 crore. Even the Urdu academy of UP gets an annual grant of Rs 1 crore.

Earlier, when it did not face the resource crunch, the academy was humming with academic and literary activities of all sorts. It used to provide financial help to the ailing writers and publication grants to authors. It also encouraged translation work and under this scheme, Sharatchandraâ€™s novel â€œCharitraheenâ€�, Maithili verses of Vidyapati and poems of Ramdhari Singh Dinkar were translated into Urdu. As many as 61 books were published by the academy itself and over 2,000 books were published with the financial support of the academy.

The academy also used to give various awards in the name of renowned literary figures to outstanding writings at national level. Besides, it used to sanction scholarships to students right from primary to university level. But these activities have now become a thing of the past for want of funds.

In spite of facing acute financial hardship, the academy organises some seminars and symposia with the financial assistance from the Centre. A one-year diploma course in desk-top publishing (DTP) is conducted with the financial support from the National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language. A course in calligraphy and typ-ewriting is also running here.

Of late, the academy has decided to hold an exhibition on calligraphy in collaboration with the Iran embassy and to hold a national seminar on the life and works of Kabir with financial assistance from the Union HRD ministry. It is also planning to Urdu learning course through distance education and produce materials on adult literacy and child education, Ahmad adds.

6,"Trader shot dead as BJP, RJD men clash","PATNA: A day ahead of the counting of votes in the Danapur assembly constituency, where bypolls were held on Friday, a businessman, Jai Narayan, was killed when supporters of RJD and BJP exchanged fire in post-election violence on Saturday evening.

The deceased, who ran a kirana store near the Medical Colony, Khagaul, was shot dead by three persons near his shop around 7.45 pm. According to locals, the trader had worked for the BJP candidate in the bypoll. He was called near his shop and shot dead from point blank range, eyewitnesses said, adding two bullets were pumped into his head and he died instantly.

Angry at the killing of his supporter, BJP candidate Satyanarayan Singh and party workers brought the body near the divisional railway managerâ€™s office and blocked the Khagaul-Danapur road. There was also an exchange of fire between his supporters and the alleged killers, reports said. Panic gripped the area as people took shelter at the Danapur railway junction. At 9.30 pm, the police intervened and opened fire at the warring groups. The police wanted to take possession of the body for autopsy. Two passersby sustained bullet injuries as the police fired six rounds.

The unrest continued for about 150 minutes. Power supply also went off, adding to the panic among the people as the cross-firing took place when there was no light. The Khagaul police station confirmed bullet injury to only one passerby due to the police firing. The police have so far not made any arrests, either in connection with the murder of the trader or regarding the violence between the BJP and RJD supporters.

Though no casualty was reported on the polling day in Danapur, several clashes took place between the supporters of RJD candidate Ramanand Yadav and the BJP candidate Satyanarayan Singh.

7,Guj govt flays NHRC for stinging report,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has sharply criticised the National Human Rights Commission for failing to respect ""the sentiments of five crore people of Gujarat"" while coming up with its critical remarks against the officialdom''s all-round failure in handling the recent communal riots.

Refusing to accept any of the NHRC proposals, the government in a statement said, ""The NHRC should have known that investigating authorities have no powers to release the accused on bail. Only courts have.""

The NHRC had mentioned that the percentage of Hindus released on bail was much higher than that of Muslims.

The statement insists, ""Yet, it is a fact that in a large number of cases, the investigating authorities strongly opposed any application for releasing the accused on bail. Whether it is Ahmedabad''s Naroda-Patia or Gulbarg Society cases, or it is Vadodara''s Best Bakery case, not one person has been granted bail.""

Repeating statistics on steps towards controlling communal riots, the statement says, ""The steps taken by the state police have no precedence in free India. The police fired 10,295 rounds of bullets and 14,838 teargas shells. It led to the death of 199 persons and injuries to 402. The police made 31,090 preventive arrests and 18,317 arrests under different sections. As many as 4,120 offences have been registered.""

This apart, the ""police carried out combing in sensitive areas and took arms and ammunition into custody.""

Thanks to these steps, the statement says, ""the law and order situation is now normal and for the last three weeks there have been no major untoward incidents.""

Referring to the ouster of Ahmedabad police commissioner PC Pande on supercop KPS Gill''s recommendation, it underlines, ""Necessary changes were made in the police administration to make its working more effective.""

8,Maya reverses Rajnath’s MBC policy,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawati showed major policy difference with her ally, the BJP, on Saturday when she reversed her predecessor Rajnath Singhâ€™s decision on the reservation quota for the most dalits and most backward classes and nullified all amendments made to this effect.

In place of it, the original Act of 1994 has been put into effect again, under which flat reservation quota of 21 per cent for the Scheduled Castes, 27 per cent for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and two per cent for the Scheduled Tribes is admissible.

The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting presided over by the chief minister.

Singh, during his tenure, had set up the Social Justice Committee (SJC) with great fanfare and implemented its report to ensure reservations within the existing quota for the most dalits and the most backwards.

The 1994 Act for this purpose was amended in the light of the SJC recommendations. But this could not be implemented, as its operation was stayed following a writ petition, still pending for final hearing before the Supreme Court.

As a result, the recruitments to various posts could not be made and, in some cases, results of the examinations had to to be withheld. This dealt a blow to hundreds of aspiring candidates, who had sat for examinations. And the worst affected by it are those who have qualified for about 520 posts of the Provincial Civil Services.

The government had, therefore, decided to go back to the original reservation policy just to avoid all complications, chief secretary DS Bagga told mediapersons. â€œThere are a total 28,700 vacant posts in the state and the government can not fill them unless it does away with the hurdles in its way,â€� he said.

For this purpose, he said, fresh ordinance would be promulgated to do away the amendments made by the Rajnath Singhâ€™s government to incorporate provisions in accordance to the report of the SJP.

But indications are clear that the government would not press for it and the writ pending before the Supreme Court would automatically be rendered infructuous. Politically, this suits the chief minister as new reservations would create a divide within her dalit vote bank which, too, is divided between haves and have-nots on the basis of socio-economic inequalities.

The government has also decided to provide 20 per cent reservation to girl students in the state-level joint entrance examinations for admission to various engineering and other professional courses.

9,'Gujarat violence not outcome of Godhra',"NEW DELHI: People''s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR), a leading human rights organisation, on Saturday alleged that the Gujarat riots were not an outcome of the Godhra incident as the ""planning"" had begun much earlier and charged the state government with complicity in the violence.

Demanding a CBI probe into major incidents of communal violence and dismissal of the Narendra Modi government, the PUDR expressed doubts over Modi government''s intentions with regard to taking action against the perpetrators of riots.

It also termed as ""miserable"" the government''s rehabilitation policy.

""Given the systematic way the Modi government has sabotaged the registration of criminal cases arising from the communal violence, there is little chance of the guilty being brought to book,"" PUDR secretary Shashi Saxena told reporters here.

He also released a report compiled after a PUDR team''s visit to the state from April 5 to 14.

He demanded proper registration of crimes and arrest of the guilty, handing over of the probe to the CBI, making mandatory for the state to provide material support to the relief camps, allowing displaced people to stay in camps till they are adequately settled and ensuring security, livelihood and humane living conditions for all the displaced people.

""Planning for attacks against the minority community had begun much before February 27 (when Godhra incident occurred),"" the PUDR said.

""There had been a steady build-up of meetings, distribution of leaflets etc over the last two years, all propagating hatred and myths about the minority community,"" it added.

""After the Godhra incident, meetings were held in villages on February 27 and 28 to plan the details of the attacks. The use of similar methods across districts, such as swords of the same brand and gas cylinders, and the fact that the same mob went from place to place over a couple of days with impunity is further evidence of planning,"" it said.

It said that burning ""seems to have been the preferred method (of rioters), so as not to leave evidence.""

""The fact that the Gujarat government supported the bandh of February 28 and March one despite its experience of large-scale violence against the minority community after a similar bandh in 2000, is evidence of its complicity in the violence right from the start,"" the PUDR alleged.

It also alleged ""deliberate failure"" on part of the police to contain violence.

11,CBI arrest 3 in arms licence case,"NEW DELHI: The CBI has arrested three persons following fresh instances of issuing of bogus arms licences and registered a fifth case in the inter-state arms licence racket involving officials and arms dealers of Delhi, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir.

Highly-placed agency sources said that the three including R N Sharma, proprietor of Sharma Gun House (Delhi), and two others were picked by the sleuths of CBI following raids at several places in Delhi and other cities.

The sources said the three were arrested following fresh instances of issuing of bogus arms licences allegedly by the office of SDM Gurgaon R C Panwaria, who is abscounding.

The CBI has been looking for Panwaria and has raided his home and office after registering a case, the fifth in connection with the arms license racket, the sources said.

According to the CBI, the arms dealers allegedly hatched a criminal conspiracy with certain officials of SDM Office, Gurgaon and some unknown private persons at Delhi, Jammu and other places to facilitate procurement of arms licences in the assumed names of the beneficiaries, the sources said.

In pursuance of the said criminal conspiracy, officials at SDM Gurgaon office facilitated the issuance and reissuance of the arms licences by abusing their official position as public servants, the agency alleged.

The public servants have been accused of manipulating, interpolating and tampering with the records of the SDM Gurgaon, they said.

After the issuance of licences, the dealers allegedly facilitated the purchase of weapons and ammunition including 0.32 pistols, 0.32 revolvers, 0.315 rifles, 0.22 rifles, 0.12 DBBL guns and 0.12 SBBL guns, they said.

The arms dealers illegally charged exhorbitant amounts from the beneficiaries violating the licencing conditions imposed on them under Arms Act and thereby caused pecuniary loss to the government and corresponding gains to themselves and others, CBI alleged.

The accused have been charged under various sections of IPC including 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) 468 (forgery) of IPC, Section 25 of Arms Act, certain sections of Prevention of Corruption Act.

Earlier, in four FIRs, CBI''s Special Investigation Cell-I had named R N Sharma, proprietor of Sharma Gun House (Delhi), owners of Sharda Gun House (Delhi), owners of Chaudhary Arms, (Faridabad, Haryana) and officials of Jammu ADM office and SDM office of Gurgaon and Faridabad.

CBI had on November 2 last, arrested Amar Nath Ichhapujani, who was posted as Faridabad SDM between 1994-98, following recovery of several ""incriminating documents"" during search conducted at his residence. Later, he was released on bail.

Ichhapujani was allegedly involved in a criminal conspiracy hatched by some arms dealers and officials of ADM Office, Jammu, for issuing illegal arms licences, according to CBI.

The agency had claimed to have seized hundreds of illegal arms licences from these arms dealer. Some of the licences issued during 1994-98 had gone into the hands of anti-national elements, criminals and gansters, it said.

15,More politics than culture at Sindhu fest,"LEH, Ladakh: The setting for rhetoric replete with aggression couldnâ€™t have been more ironic.

Amidst the backdrop of majestic, snow-capped mountains and the quietly flowing Indus, the BJP seemed to make the most of the Sindhu darshan festival here to up the ante against Pakistan. This, of course, apart from the overtones of â€˜â€˜Hindutvaâ€™â€™ that this festival, introduced to Ladakh in 1997, carries.

For Union home minister L K Advani, the â€˜â€˜moving spiritâ€™â€™ behind the festival after having â€˜â€˜discoveredâ€™â€™ the Indus some years ago, the inaugural function on Saturday was yet another occasion for him to talk about the hidden war that Pakistan has unleashed upon the country. And for sports and youth affairs minister Uma Bharati to recite, once again, a lengthy poem to rouse the gatheringâ€™s patriotic spirit by saying: â€˜â€˜Bande matram likhwa denge Jinnah ki mazaar per.â€™â€™

But for the dances, the festival â€” meant â€˜â€˜to project the Indus as a symbol of Indiaâ€™s unity and communal harmonyâ€™â€™ and promote tourism in the Ladakh region â€” bore greater resemblance to a public rally. Curiously, despite the magnificent backdrop provided by the mountains, the organisers had even deemed it fit to have a tacky 120-foot-long painting erected on the bank of the river.

Advani was keen on indulging in further Pakistan bashing. So was Uma Bharati. Advani, though, in his concluding remarks, did hope that the day would finally arrive when representatives from Pakistan too would participate in the function. Culture, tourism? There wasnâ€™t any mention of that in his speech.

Perhaps he thought that task was best left to the Union minister for tourism and culture, Jagmohan, who was also present.

Prior to delivering his speech, Advani along with Cabinet colleagues, among them Urban development minister Ananth Kumar and J&K chief minister Farooq Abdullah, offered prayers at the Sindhu ghat.

All, perhaps, was not lost for the Ladakhis. They benefited a Rs 5 crore package for improving Ladakhâ€™s sewerage, and the setting up of an adventure sports academy.
