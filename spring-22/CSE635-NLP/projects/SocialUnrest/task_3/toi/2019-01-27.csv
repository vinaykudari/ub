2,Criminals `overshadow' UP polls,"lucknow: over 60 candidates with criminal background are in the electoral fray in up. a partywise breakup is: sp and the bsp (over 20 each), the bjp and its allies (around 18) and the congress (over 15), besides dozens of independents. most of them have been mlas in the past and are even more confident of victory this time round. interestingly, they also rely on their own strength rather than any ideology or an issue or even the symbol of the party they represent. however, one of the reasons attributed to this trend is that of the failure of the political and administrative system, which has not lived up to people's expectations. which is why ""enterprising ruffians"" are on the comeback trail. the trend is on the rise, particularly during the last one decade when money and muscle power have come to stay in up elections. no party is free from this malice. ironically, the ruling bjp has also become a platform for such candidates. as many as six seats have been left by it for its allies of alleged criminal antecedents. for instance they are like umakant yadav of jdu from azamgarh, pawan pandey of lok jana shakti (ljs) from kateri, arvind singh of ljs from rae bareli, pappu jaiswal from pipraha, haishanker tiwari from chillupar and kunwar raghuraj pratap singh alias raja bhaiyya from kunda in pratapgarh. like this, those figure in the bjp's own list, the prominent are ajay pratap singh alias lalla bhaiyya, former minister who had been accused in connection with the murder of his driver from colonelganj in gonda, suresh khanna from shajahanpur, sahani ullaha from utraula, gomati yadav from mahona ajay rai from kolashla (gajipur) and shiv bahadur saxena from tanda. while arvind giri, omprakash gupta, udai raj yadav, vinod kumar singh, jhoku paswan, chandresh paswan, baleshwar yadav, afzal ansari, daroga saroj, durga yadav manoj rai, paras nath yadav, rakesh pandey and mohamad shami figure prominently in the sp's list, the bsp has some names like yunus ali, intzar alias bobby, mirtyunjaya shukla, abhaya singh, amar mani tripathi, sushil kumar singh, ramvir upadhyaya and bal kumar, brother of dreaded criminal dadua. so is the list of the congress and independents.

5,Canvassers turn patriotic on R-Day,"amritsar: political leaders here made the most of republic day by exploiting people's patriotic sentiments. if congress leaders harped on the alleged rampant corruption and forcing of the country into a debt trap by the ruling alliance, bjp leaders boasted about their achievements in bringing forward-looking policies for the development of the country. however, almost all the speeches were similar in that they were liberally interspersed with satire against the opposition candidates. almost all assembly seat contestants surprised residents in their constituencies by celebrating republic day, an activity which was without precedent.the onlookers, too, were liberal in running down this display of opportunism. meanwhile, the district-level government function was held at guru nanak stadium where village development and panchayat minister nirmal singh kahlon hoisted the tricolour.on the occasion, dr boparai and sub-fire officer madan lal were honoured for respectively performing surgery on an aids patient and showing immense courage while saving many lives during the recent land-mine blast near mahwa, that left 18 killed and several injured. no toffees for pak as against the usual practice, india did not offer any sweets or gifts to pakistan on republic day, presumably due to the heightened tension between the neighbours. under normal circumstances, customs or border security force officials posted at the wagha check post exchange pleasantries and gifts with their pakistani counterparts on such occasions, as a mark of goodwill. a special flag hoisting ceremony was,however, held at wagha.

7,"No arrest, detenues' interrogation continues","kolkata: even four days after the daring terrorist strike at the american center, the police were yet to make any formal arrests though interrogation of suspects continued on saturday. ''we picked up some persons for interrogation during the day, but no arrest has so far been made,'' city police commissioner sujoy chakraborty told pti. around 125 persons have been examined, some of them more than once, as city police sleuths continued raids at various places in the city and other districts on the basis of 'vital clues'. deputy commissioner (detective department-i) soumen mitra, who is in charge of the investigations, said ishaq ali khan, father of asif reza khan killed in a police encounter last month, had also been interrogated. asif is believed to be local contact of dubai-based don aftab ansari. immediately after the attack, a person identifying himself as ansari had called up newspaper offices here to claim responsiblity for the attack saying it was in retaliation of the killing of asif reza khan. two other brothers of asif have also been examined. mitra claimed that the investigation was proceeding in the right direction, but ''some more time would be needed to solve the case' which is very complicated. a top police source had on friday claimed that the police had 'zeroed in 99 per cent on the culprits', but said that their arrest depended on whether they were in india. asked whether the police had sent any team out of the state, mitra said ''not yet''. police have already drawn sketches of the attackers of the american center on the basis of eye-witness accounts and video footage of the close circuit tv installed atop the building. four policemen were killed and 18 others, including 16 cops, were injured when unidentified motrocycle-borne terrorists sprayed bullets tuesday morning.

8,State's crime rate drops as election fever catches on,"lucknow: up is at last heading for the much promised bhay mukta samaj (fearless society). with elections round the corner, there has been a perceptible drop in crime rate in the state, specially in offences related to property-- thefts, road hold-up, robbery and extortion for instance. things would be safer and sounder for a common man during the next fortnight, predict top police officials. the reason: majority of criminals, having their hands full with electioneering, are far too busy to devote any time or energy elsewhere. there has always been a pre election lull in the crime chart. however, with the growing penchant for politics among mafia and muscle men, the difference is more obvious now. ""more the number of criminals in the fray, the lesser the crime rate in the area,"" one of the officials surmised. statistics amply bear this out as campaigning builds up in up. the number of housebreaking and road hold-ups is already showing a down slide. during the period between december 16 to december 30, there were 344 registered cases of thefts and eight cases of road hold-ups which has now come down to 281 and one respectively. and here is some heartening news for up women. the state seems to have become much safer place for them. ""the dip in offences against women has been quite perceptible,"" admits dgp rk pandit. a `mere' 39 cases of rape have been reported from january 1 to 15 as against nearly double their number reported a fortnight earlier than that. a comparative analysis of crime graph between january 1 to january 15 for the year 2001 and 2002 proves to be more interesting. the election year reports 281 housebreak, 118 cases of robbery and seven cases of abduction as against a corresponding figure of 367, 159 and 11 respectively last year. the incidents of affray come down from 258 last year to 200 this year. the police high-ups while conceding that part of the declining figure could be due to the marked political nexus between the criminals and politicians attributed some credit to the pre election crime drive carried out last month. ""at least 30,000 baddies have been rounded up during the period,"" said ig crime satyavrata. but, why the drive carried out at other times don't yield the same results still remains a moot point. ""who do you think are the guys who would go around campaigning for the likes of abhay singh, rajendra pahadi and ravindra bhoora etc,"" asks a senior dig. ""the answer would be the birds of the same flock. moreover, this goon brigade is under tremendous pressure from the big bosses to behave well. therefore, peace reigns per force and the janta can have a fleeting taste of ramraj.""

17,Teachers' rally means holiday for students,"mangalore: the members of the association of mangalore university college teachers (amuct), under the aegis of federation of university college teachers' association, will be going on mass casual leave on wednesday to take part in the teachers' rally in bangalore. a press note from amuct president rolphy mascarehnas stated that as the teachers would be on leave, classes would not be held on that day. the rally will commence from chikka lal bagh, bangalore, at 2 p.m. on wednesday. mascarehnas said the teachers were protesting against the permanent withdrawal of grant-in-aid for all present and future vacancies in private aided colleges; betrayal of teachers by bifurcating composite degree colleges; and denial of elected representation to the undergraduate college teachers in the statutory bodies of the universities as per the new karnataka universities act 2000. apart from this, the abolition of examination remuneration for teachers and posing the threat of imprisonment in case of refusal to do examination related work; withholding promotion and placement due to the problems created by notional increment and delay in the disbursement of salaries for november and december last year. he also stated that the freeze on all vacancies, present and future, by the finance department by stating that grant-in-aid is not permanent, has in one stroke permanently damaged job security, pay security and professional satisfaction hitherto enjoyed by the teaching and non-teaching community of the aided private colleges in the state. mascarehnas clarified that the teachers were ``always ready'' to cooperate with the government and agitation was not the objective. though the teachers have conducted classes without causing any trouble to the students or the government, the government, on its part, had ignored teachers demands, he added. he added that the government should not take this as a prestige issue and try to solve the grievances of the teachers.

19,"Licenced to practice law, qualified or not","new delhi: the delhi bar council issues licences to law graduates for starting practice in courts here without verifying their certificates. if one wonders why the lawyers' credentials aren't checked before they are allowed to start accepting cases, here is the answer. the dbc does not have any means of verifying whether the certificates submitted to them are genuine or fake, council members said. ''it is impossible to crosscheck each certificate that the graduates deposit with us during their enrolment process. we just have to believe them,'' ramesh gupta, a member of the enrolment committee, said. jagdev, another council member, said over 2,000 candidates apply for enrolment to the delhi bar council every year. ''we cannot say no to even one person. everybody has to be enrolled,'' he said, without ruling out the possibility of people submitting fake certificates. ''if munshis (helpers of advocates) in tis hazari can wear black coats and white bands to appear in court as lawyers, anyone can pose as a lawyer,'' he said. so how does the council detect an unqualified 'lawyer' and what action does it take? ''we take action as and when we get complaints against any lawyer,'' dbc chairman k c mittal said. at present the council has only two complaints against advocates who allegedly furnished fake certificates. last year it had recommended the suspension of an advocate to the bar council of india for furnishing false information. the advocate's practising licence was later suspended. speaking of the precautions they take, dbc secretary surya prakash khatri claimed the council enrolled only those law graduates whose application was supported by an affidavit and a certificate from two senior lawyers, with not less than 10 years of experience.

20,Two Cabinet ministers lock horns on land for IAS club,"new delhi: ''we all want a clean and green delhi.'' so declares union minister of urban development ananth kumar. but he sees nothing wrong in the allotment of a plot of land to a club run largely by the ias officers in a green area — a district park — of the capital. after all, as kumar told the times of india, ''the allotment has been done without flouting any regulations and under the by-laws, a recreational club with only 10 per cent ground coverage is allowed in a district park.'' to which his predecessor, jagmohan, now the union minister of tourism and culture, who had prevented the officers from usurping 3.52 acres of green area for a club, remarks: ''the issue really is whether what is being done is in accordance with fair and just governance.'' the club — the civil services officers institute — functions at present from premises located on kasturba gandhi marg, near connaught place. asked how the officers club managed to get prime land in the capital's chanakyapuri area allotted, kumar replied, ''they approached us and we gave the land.'' in further justification for the allotment of land in an area ear-marked as a district park, kumar says, ''there are precedents. it is not the first time that land has been allotted in a green use area.'' to buttress his argument, kumar gave the examples of the gymkhana club, the golf club and the national sports club of india. responds jagmohan: ''these are old clubs which came up before the formulation of the master plan and when the requirements were different.'' kumar, in fact, maintains that the allotment was not done during his tenure, nor was it stopped by jagmohan during his tenure as urban development minister. citing dates, kumar says the proposal for allotment came on september 3, 1998 and the approval came on september 7, 1998. a period during which ram jethmalani headed the ministry. jethmalani, when contacted, said: ''i do not remember so i cannot comment. i will have to see the papers.'' the allotment was no doubt made possible in double-quick time for the club boasts of the cabinet secretary as head of its governing council and the secretary, department of personnel and training, as chairperson of the executive committee.

21,SC reminds govt about common marriage code,"new delhi: if marriages are made in heaven, as they say, there should not be any reason for it to be governed by separate codes in different communities. way back in 1985, the supreme court had recommended that the government ''intervene to provide for a uniform code of marriage and divorce and provide by law a way out of the unhappy situation being faced by certain couples''. sixteen years down the line, the court recalled that judgment( ms jorden diengdeh vs s s chopra), suggesting that a common law of marriage be applicable to ''all people irrespective of religion or caste''. justice r p sethi and justice y k sabharwal (savitri pandey vs prem chandra pandey) wondered over the fact that even when an unhappy couple asserts that their marriage had come to an end, they can still not be divorced or separated by a decree under the prevailing law. the sanctity of marriage cannot be left to the whims of any one of the spouses. irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a ground by itself to dissolve it, the law says. then, there are ways to overcome this. if a decree of divorce is granted and it is not stayed by the appellate court, the beneficiary of the decree can marry someone though the appeal is pending against the divorce order. would that marriage be null and void? if yes, what would happen to the children born out of that marriage? would the new spouse (husband or wife) who happens to be the mother or father of the children from the post-decree marriage be asked to separate for good? would that serve the social purpose for which certain legislations have been enacted? apparently, the answer is no. it is felt that the period of appeal should be increased to 90 days instead of 30 days. even if the decree is not stayed, the marriage performed by the litigating spouses during pendency of the appeal must be considered null and void. if a builder's plea is rejected, the building would be demolished by a judicial order. courts, however, cannot be expected to become bulldozers of the institution of marriage. ''no party can be permitted to carve out the ground for destroying a family which is the basic unit of society. the foundation of the family rests on the institution of a legal and valid marriage'', said the bench as it counselled courts to aim at preserving the matrimonial home and be reluctant to dissolve marriages on the asking of one of the parties. if that be so, should not the laws leave it to the spouses to decide what is best for them. however, austerity and dowry-less marriages have to be made compulsory through stringent laws.
