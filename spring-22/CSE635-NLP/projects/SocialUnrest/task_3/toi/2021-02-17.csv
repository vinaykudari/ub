0,EC may decide on real NCP after polls,"NEW DELHI: It would be a long wait for Sharad Pawar and P A Sangma before either of them can claim to be the leader of the real Nationalist Congress Party.

There are indications that the arbiter in the matterâ€”the Election Commissionâ€”will put the decision on hold till the election results are out.

And most likely, the â€˜clockâ€™â€”the NCPâ€™s symbolâ€”will be put temporarily frozen and both factions allotted different symbols to contest the general elections and possibly the assembly election in Maharashtra.

The EC may then decide on the rightful heir to the NCP legacy based on the general election results. The EC had adopted this method in the 1990s during the bitter divisions of the Janata Parivar.

1,'India Shining' and so are farms,"NEW DELHI: For the ruling coalition, it couldnâ€™t have been better timed. On Tuesday, agriculture secretary R C A Jain released rosy estimates on food production inching ahead to ""all-time highs"" or nearly as close.

So, overall foodgrain production estimates are now pitched at a record 212.20 million tonnes, ""marginally"" over the earlier record of 212.02 million tonnes. If the weather gods keep smiling, the figures could get better.

Adding sheen to the ""India Shining"" campaign, the nine oilseeds are set to break the record with 24.98 million ton-nes, up from a previous best of 24.75 million tonnes. Even pulses are inching towards a record 14.91 million tonnes, with an estimate of 14.42 million tonnes. BJP campaign managers can be expected to flaunt these figures to cou-nter suggestions that the countryside is not shining.

2,Minority report: Govt forgets rules,"NEW DELHI: Desperate to secure sinecures for its Dalit leaders before the polls, the government has put the horse before the cart in making political appointments to the national commissions for SCs and STs.

Former UP governor Suraj Bhan is expected to be the new chairman of the national commission for SCs. When contacted, Bhan, who is also a former Lok Sabha deputy Speaker said, â€˜â€˜I have also heard it being discussed. It can happen very soon.â€™â€™

A delegation of four members of the old commission met the President on Tuesday to protest this move. These members, mostly from the BJP, who would lose their job soon, have raised procedural issues in their memorandum to the President.

After the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, the government was not expected to make such cabinet minister-rank appointments to a commission mandated by the Constitution. If Bhanâ€™s appointment was made before the Lok Sabha dissolution, then the government has done it without following laid down procedures.

3,"TDP to hire 4,200 buses for its ominbus rally","HYDERABAD: About 4,200 APSRTC buses will be pulled out of the state transport network to carry TDP supporters to that partyâ€™s mother-of-allrallies scheduled for Feb. 22.

Minister Devender Goud said the buses will be part of an armada of vehicles being hired by the party to ferry lakhs of people to its pre-election bugle-blower rally titled Vijayabheri at Parade Grounds in Secunderabad. This would include 22 trains â€” one from each district â€” many private buses, lorries, and jeeps. Thirty-four parking bays have been earmarked for the incoming vehicles.

APSRTC managing director A Sivashankar confirmed that a fifth of the fleet has been requisitioned for the TDP Vijaybheri. The APSRTC runs 19,176 buses in the districts, and 2,000 in the city. It also hires an additional 1,329. Out of this strength, 10 per cent (approximately 2000) are spare buses which can be utilised for other services.

In spite of nearly one-fifth of the fleet being requisitioned for the rally, Sivasankar said the transport system would not suffer. â€œWe will make alternative arrangements,â€� he said. The TDP is hoping to bring 30 lakh people to the city of 80 lakh. TDP president Chandrababu Naidu told party leaders on Tuesday he expected elaborate arrangements to minimise discomfort to citizens.

Two former police officers, Sitarama Rao and Chandrashekhar Reddy, will train about 3,000 volunteers in crowd management on that day. Most of the trains will culminate at Secunderabad railway station, which is in proximity to the venue. Those coming from coastal Andhra will be housed in function halls while people from districts closer will be put up in tents on city outskirts.

The MCH has been ordered to supply water using 120 tankers. The rally will begin at Nizam College at 1 pm with the chief minister at the head and culminate in a public meeting at Parade Grounds in Secunderabad at 4 pm. The march will be a veritable carnival replete with elephants, horses, motorcycles, open-top jeeps and flag-waving MPs and MLAs. Cultural groups will perform in Republic Day style â€” for which rehearsals would be held at NAC grounds from Feb. 19.

4,Union minister cautions against spurt in violence,"PATNA: Junior Union home minister Swami Chinmayanand on Monday cautioned people against a spurt in clashes between private senas and extremist violence in Bihar during the parliamentary polls.

Talking to newsmen at the Patna airport before emplaning for Delhi, Chinmayanand said that in Bihar, the PWG, MCC and Ranvir Sena are the extremist groups who can create trouble during the polls.

Although the minister refused to comment on the law and order situation prevailing in the state, he made it clear that the history of militancy in Bihar warranted pre-emptive measures in view of the parliamentary polls.

To another query about the state government''s demand for deployment of more paramilitary forces in Bihar, Chinmayanand said that deployment of paramilitary forces has to be made across the country, particularly during the parliamentary polls. It is not a Bihar-specific matter, he said.

""If the state government wants to create India Reserve Force, the Union government is ready to provide funds,"" Chinmayanand added.

He said that after initial hiccups in sending the Indian cricket team to Pakistan, the final decision to allow the team to tour Pakistan was made on the Pakistan government''s assurance of adequate security and intervention of the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

About the possible entry of Nepali Maoists in Bihar, Chinmayanand said that there was no such threat. But if they try to enter Bihar they would be stopped at the border, he added.

5,HC raps govt on primary teachers' issue,"PATNA: A division bench of the Patna High Court, presided over by Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan, on Monday directed the state government to make it clear before the court how it intended to appoint primary school teachers by relaxing the requisite qualification.

It asked the state government to apprise the court what it has done so far for complying with the Supreme Court order passed in 1997. ""Neither policy matters nor facts have been placed before it by the state government during the last 11 years. Out of the 19,700 appointments made by the state government in 1993, 17,281 were untrained teachers,"" the bench observed.

Land consolidation: The high court on Monday criticised the state government for its inaction and directed the state counsel to re-start land consolidation work in the state by appointing land consolidation officers with immediate effect. An order to this effect was passed by a division bench comprising Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice Navin Sinha.

Vacating of govt quarters: Another division bench, presided over by Justice Nagendra Rai, on Monday criticised the state government for adopting a pick and choose policy in getting government quarters vacated from their illegal occupants. High-profile politicians and officials like Surendra Yadav, Surendra Prasad, Azad Gandhi and former DGP R R Prasad, who have been occupying government quarters illegally, have been left untouched, it observed and directed the state government to get the remaining 21 of the 50 quarters vacated by Thursday and inform the high court to this effect.

Chiraiyatand overbridge: The delay in the work on the widening of Chiraiyatand road-cum-railway overbridge and its approach roads irked the high court on Monday and its division bench, presided over by Justice Nagendra Rai, and it directed finance commissioner U N Panjiyar and managing director of the Bihar State Pul Nirman Nigam to be present in the court on the next date of hearing.

Earlier, the court was informed by the executive engineer, road construction department, who was present in the court, that the delay in the construction work is due to financial constraints.

He, however, assured the court that by 2005 the widening of the overbridge and the construction of approach roads would be completed. Advocate M P Gupta appeared on behalf of the intervenor-petitioner.

6,"Ground the flyover, demand protesters","BANGALORE: Senior citizens, homemakers and residents of Basavanagudi, led by freedom fighters H.S. Doreswamy and T. Srirangacharya, staged a protest on Tuesday against the construction of a flyover at the National College junction on Vani Vilas Road.

Holding banners and cards, they took out a demonstration on D.V.G. Road, Vani Vilas Road and other areas, asking the BCC to immediately stop construction.

Over 70 trees, more than 100 years old, are being chopped for the flyover, charged V.K. Somashekar, managing trustee of Grahak Shakthi. A flyover is not needed at all; it will create a heat island where carbon monoxide will get trapped, a pamphlet distributed by the National College Flyover Action Committee mentioned.

Over 25,000 students from National College, Jain College, V.V. Puram College, Kempe Gowda Institute of Medical Sciences, Sree Saraswati Vidya Mandir and Vasavi Vidya Niketan will be affected, said action committee member Ambika Krishna.

The protesters suggested an alternative to the flyover. ""Convert certain streets into one-ways,"" they said, citing the one-way around Hudson Circle. The action committee also highlighted the historical significance of National College Circle, which will be buried under the flyover. ""It was here that Quit India movement was launched. Vani Vilas Circle gets its name from Vani Vilas Sannidanadavaru, the erstwhile queen of Mysore state.""

7,2003 replay: A CETback to govt move,"BANGALORE: Professional college admissions are likely to be as controversial as last year.

Even as the state government has convened a meeting of all private college managements on Thursday, managements stand divided, with the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges (Comed) refusing to attend the meeting.

Comed chairman R.L. Jalappa told The Times of India: ""The state government has invited us but we will not attend the meeting as we have not opted for the government''s Common Entrance Test (CET). We have nothing to do with the government''s admission process.""

Jalappa reiterated that Comed would conduct a parallel entrance test to fill the 50 per cent management quota. All admissions would be in accordance with the schedule drawn up by the Medical Council of India and other regulatory bodies.

""The entrance test will be held in May. A meeting will be convened shortly to decide on inviting applications, finalising the date of the entrance test and the admission schedule,"" he said.

Comed has 30 colleges affiliated to it and is hopeful of replicating the successful completion of the entrance test for PG medical and dental admissions. ""The test was conducted in a completely professional manner. We will conduct the test for MBBS, BDS and BE courses, too,"" he added.

Meanwhile, a section of dental colleges â€” 25 colleges affiliated to the Karnataka State Private Dental Colleges Association â€” appealed to the government to conduct the CET for the 50 per cent managements seats, too. The forum of new engineering colleges, besides institutions like the BMS College of Engineering and BMS Institute of Technology, have already supported the government. ""We urge the CET cell to prepare a common merit list which will be used to admit students. The state government should also allow us to fill vacant seats after the admission process,"" association president L.K. Raju said.

""Even if something goes wrong in the entrance test or admissions, we can take shelter under CET. Besides, colleges should be given representation in the fee and admissions committee,"" Raju said.

CET cell special officer D.N. Nayak said the meeting had been convened after professional colleges came forward to adopt the CET. ""After writing letters to individual colleges, we wanted to hold discussions with association representatives and hence the meeting. Some of them want non-Karnataka candidates to be allowed to take CET. All this would be discussed at the meeting,"" he said.

8,"Stars on field, visa law breakers off it","KOLKATA: As Nigerian footballer Lawrenceâ€™s body lies in a morgue, many of his countrymen and other foreigners still turn up for the cityâ€™s favourite football clubs when they should have been put on the next flight home.

If the records are ever compiled, it would shock people to learn just how many footballers stay illegally in Kolkata. Estimates say that there are at least three times as many illegals as registered players.

The police are remarkably alert when it comes to nabbing immigrants from a neighbouring country, but they seem to ignore illegals if they have a pair of football boots on. The Foreigners Registration Office (FRO), which has a police investigating cell, claims it doesnâ€™t even know of Lawrenceâ€™s death. Neither does DC (security control office) P.K. Chattopadhyay. It seems ridiculously easy for foreigners to get into Kolkata and overstay. All it takes is a 180-day tourist visa. It doesnâ€™ t need any registration, unlike business visas, and is easy to procure.

There is no system to keep a tab on foreigners so they conveniently overstay their visa period. If they get caught, which is extremely rare, they only have to shell out a Rs 1,750 fine to get a onetime visa for the return trip. They return soon after. The cycle continues. The Foreigners Act is rarely enforced.

Most of them do not leave any forwarding address with the Foreigners Registration Office upon arrival in Kolkata, making it almost impossible for cops to track them down. â€œVery few such cases are referred to us by other agencies for probe,â€� said a senior officer.

Dodging the law is much easier for footballers, despite their being in the limelight. Police officers admit they face pressure from influential club bosses and top bureaucrats to ignore such cases. Itâ€™s only Lawrenceâ€™s death that has exposed this can of worms now. No one seems to know what will happen of the body. â€œThe concern now should be to dispose the body,â€� said Chattopadhay. â€œSomeone has to come forward, either the club he played for, or his friends. We have to write to the consul general, or even to the embassy through the state government. If they formally decline to take back the body, we will initiate steps for disposal,â€� an officer said.

How foreigners dribble past the law

_ They enter the country on tourist visas and overstay the 180-day limit. They donâ€™t leave any forwarding address with the registration office making it difficult for cops to track them down.

_ If caught, which is rarely, they produce a medical certificate or claim they had to attend an educational tour. At worst, they have to pay a fine of Rs 1,750 and go home. Most return soon after.

... And cops score an own goal

_ The police seldom take the initiative to track down foreigners who have overstayed. They are even more reluctant to charge foreign footballers because of pressure from club managers

_ The police can invoke the Foreigners Act and arrest illegal immigrants on non-bailable charges. They can be jailed or deported on court orders. But this rarely happens.

9,Excise policy: Robbing Peter to help Paul,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab excise policy for the 2004-â€™05, approved by the council of ministers on Tuesday, is being described as aâ€˜â€˜rate-driven policy to help big liquor baronsâ€™â€™. Aimed at curbing illicit liquor trade, the policy anticipates excise revenue of Rs 1,470-crore, almost the same as that the state is expected to earn this year.

The new policy, sources say, would lead to a fall in the prices of premium liquor and a steep rise in brands consumed by the common man. This is because the duty slab for premium brands has been lowered from Rs 48 per proof litre (ppl) to Rs 39 ppl, whereas for common and medium brands it has been raised from Rs 24 ppl to Rs 39 ppl.

The government would not go in for hike in auction money this year, thereby defeating the very purpose of holding auctions. Implicit message to the cartels: you wonâ€™t be burdened. In other words, the big players can fix prices at will, much higher than those in neighbouring areas.

Under the new policy, there would be no additional quota of liquor for cartels for annual sale because of the quantity of liquor available for consumers next year would come down and allow the cartels to sell at prices much higher than those of last year. In all, 200 lakh proof litres of IMFL would be made available for consumption in the state next year.

There would be a marginal increase in the number of liquor vends but the conditions for obtaining licences to sell beer, wine, ready-to-drink beverages for department stores have been relaxed.

The government has declared Khadoor Sahib in Amritsar district as the eighth holy city inPunjab here the sale of liquor would not be permitted. The other places include Amritsar, Muktsar, Talwandi Sabo, Anandpur Sahib, Chamkaur Sahib, Bhaini Sahib and Raian.

10,Pak opp seeks to put govt on mat for pardoning Khan,"ISLAMABAD: Opposition parties in Pakistan have sought to put the government on the mat in the wake of mess in the country''s nuclear establishment arising out of Abdul Qadir Khan''s proliferation activities and the Presidential pardon to the scientist.

Suggesting that there was something fishy behind the pardon, a number of questions were raised about the way the government granted it when investigations were not complete and also why the government called it a conditional pardon.

PPP''s parliamentary leader Raza Rabbani asked why Khan was granted pardon in ""such a haste"" when government had at that stage stated that investigations had not been completed.

Rabbani''s remarks come close on the heels of comments by party chief Benazir Bhutto in US media that Khan was being made a ""scapegoat"" and pointed to the involvement of the army top brass in the clandestine transfer of nuclear technology to Libya, Iran and North Korea.

Seeking to put the Government on the mat, the Opposition members moved 10 adjournment motions on the issue.

Going through the developments following the sensational expose, Rabbani wanted to know why, the President had announced a pardon on February five, Government went about the damage control exercise saying it was conditional. Was it because of a telephone call Musharraf received from US Secretary of State Colin Powell on February six? he asked.
