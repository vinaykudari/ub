1,"Report on Sikdar case soon, says Bengal govt","KOLKATA: West Bengal home secretary Amit Kiran Deb confirmed on Tuesday that the state government will send a detailed report on the attack on senior BJP leader Tapan Sikdar to the Union home ministry soon.

During the day, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee enquired about Sikdar''s condition. His deputy L K Advani called up chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to find out more about the incident.

According to the state police, however, the attack on Sikdar near Barasat in North 24-Parganas on Monday was not preconceived. In a report submitted to the state home department on Tuesday, senior police officials claimed that Sikdar was present at the spot where CPM cadres were involved in a clash with Trinamul Congress and BJP activists.

The district intelligence branch (DIB) is, however, still probing whether sufficient security arrangements were made for Sikdar''s visit to the area. Sikdar had alleged that adequate arrangements had not been made.

Three cases were filed after Monday''s incident. One case is based on the police report from the spot. The other two are allegations made by CPM and BJP activists against each other. Twelve more people have been arrested in night long raids, taking the number of those behind bars to 32.

""Those arrested are all CPM, BJP and Trinamul Congress supporters. According to reports, the trouble began over the tearing of a CPM banner by BJP and Trinamul supporters. Even a police constable was injured,"" Narayan Ghosh, DIG (HQ), said.

3,Muscle power and political patronage hold sway,"LUCKNOW: Recovery of a large quantity of arms and ammunition from the houses in Takia Falshah on Wednesday and the violent incidents belied tall claims of city police on improvement of law and order in the city. It also brought to the fore that people now believe in â€˜muscle power'' and â€˜political patronage'' rather than on administration to solve their problems.

It was also evident from the involvement of local BSP corporator Nammu, who also has a history-sheet, in the entire episode. Interestingly, while 25 local residents of the locality have been arrested by the police on charges of rioting, no action so far has been taken against the BSP leader named in the FIR lodged by the victims. The entire incident also got a political colour with SP leaders jumping into the controversy.

The land belongs to the Sunni Waqf Board. There are around eight houses and three shops on the land. According to police, the board had re-alloted the shops and houses to different persons a few days back. There was some dispute as the people occupying the houses had refused to vacate them. The high court had on April 20 directed the district administration to get the houses and shops vacated. On May 3, officials of the district administration got the houses and shops vacated and gave the possession to the new allotees. Officials of the Waqf Board were not available for comment.

However, local residents claimed that the district administration officials had to drop their plans of vacating the houses on May 3 following protests. ""Officials had then given us ten days'' time to vacate the place or take the shelter of court,"" said an angry resident. They claimed that Nammu and his gang was also interested in the houses and had come to force the local residents out of the houses.

Residents said that he was threatening the locals since long and on Wednesday before first shot was fired, the rival group took the name of BSP leader Daud, a member of parliament from Shahbad constituency. The MP has also been named in the FIR lodged by the parents of Mohammad Aman, who was killed in the clash. Most of the people staying here have relations in Machli Mohal area. Thus, residents said, that anticipating an â€˜attack'' from the rival group, they had called their â€˜people'' from the Machali Mohal area for protection. They accused the police of playing a partisan role and said that it was for the first time in the history of Lucknow that police cane-charged people blocking road with a dead body.

Police, however, denied the charge and said the board had re-allotted four houses to the old allottees and four remaining houses were allotted to others. District administration officials, police said, had smoothly arranged the transfer on May 3. While most of the residents in the locality agreed to follow orders, one of the earlier allottees first vacated the place in the presence of officials, but on Wednesday morning came along with some goons and forcibly took possession again, said police. Police officers, however, could not explain what was the interest of Nammu in the entire episode.

5,Breakthrough in lawyer's murder,"LUCKNOW: Where the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) failed, Lucknow police on Wednesday claimed to have made a major breakthrough in the advocate Indra Dev murder case by arresting four persons, including one national level athlete allegedly involved in the murder. The police also claimed that the accused had confessed that they were hired by former minister Ram Kumar Verma to kill Singh.

SSP Anil Agarwal, at a hurriedly convened press conference in the evening, presented the four accused before mediapersons. He said that the four, namely Rahul Gautam, Prashant Kumar, Brijesh Kumar Yadav and Akhilesh Tripathi were arrested after a brief encounter by the Hazratganj police near the Golf Club. He also claimed that police had also recovered the weapon and the vehicle used in the murder and the four accused were also interrogated by the CBI sleuths from New Delhi after the arrest.

Interestingly, the SSP said that police had picked these accused earlier also during the course of their investigation and they were interrogated both by the CBI and the district police. The accused, he said, were also blackmailing Singh''s family members by offering them to give a tip-off about the murderer. However, they were allowed to go due to lack of evidence.

Indra Dev Singh was murdered on August 8, 2002, when he was coming home from the high court near his house. Singh''s wife Nayantara Singh had named the former minister and his three relatives in the FIR lodged with the police in connection with the murder of her husband. The motive for the murder was said to be a property dispute worth Rs 3 crore. The case was handed over to the CBI for investigation at the request of the family members and the agitation of lawyers.

The SSP said that the four accused had confessed that they were â€˜hoarding contractors'' and gained proximity to the former minister during an assignment. Later, they offered themselves to the minister for â€˜any kind of service'' to earn his patronage. He said that the accused had also confessed that they were paid Rs 90,000 in two instalments before the crime and Rs 1.80 lakh after the execution.

The SSP said that one of the accused, Akhilesh Tripathi, was a long-distance runner and had participated in National-level events three times, but he was also of criminal bent of mind and had been to jail in connection with a robbery two years ago. He said that the accused would be handed over to the CBI for further investigation. He said that so far the police had only confessional statements of the accused as evidence. Verma was not available for comment. Meanwhile, IG Lucknow zone has announced an award of Rs 10,000 for the police personnel involved in making the arrests.

7,State govt to develop Dalvoy lake: Salian,"MYSORE: Karnataka fisheries minister Vasanth Salian on Wednesday said the state government would soon take a decision on developing Dalvoy lake on the city outskirts into a multi-facility, besides creating facilities for fishing.

At a press meet here, he said a committee has been constituted to finalise the project which needs investment in crores. Within the next 15 days, the project will get definite shape, he added.

""Once the project is given the final touches, it will be placed before the cabinet for approval,"" Salian added.

He said the lake, spread over an area of 250 acres, has been identified as a multi-utility lake and the fisheries department is keen on developing the lake into a tourism spot. ""Only 10 acres of land will be utilised for pisciculture,"" he said.

Salian said the committee is headed by district in-charge minister Vishwanath and includes officials from all departments, including the state tourism department and the environment departments.

Referring to his ministry''s activities in the state, he said the National Co-operative Development Council (NCDC) has decided to give Rs 13.40 crore loan to the state fisheries federation to establish and develop fingerling centres in Shimoga, Bellary, Davangere, Haveri, Raichur and Dharwad districts.

This project includes training fishermen, construction of sheds at the centres and cold storage plants. ""This also includes development of 308 small tanks spread over an area of 14,880 hectares,"" he said.

The minister said there was a lot of scope for developing inland fisheries in the state. He said the government has decided to give subsidies to fishermen who come forward to buy equipment and necessary gadgets to involve in pisciculture and 33 per cent of the amount will be paid by the state government.

In addition, the department has also decided to take up development of inland fisheries in 13 districts with the assistance of the central government, he added.

This includes training youth in fishing techniques, giving rights on tanks to youth for taking up fishing and subsidy to buy fingerlings and feed, Salian said.

The minister said vigilance in the coastal districts has been stepped up to prevent the entry of mechanised boats into the territory which has been barred for fishing. He said the state government is repeatedly pleading with the Union government to bar the mechanised boats and withdraw permission to MNCs which are involved in high-tech pisciculture.

9,Faridkot lawyers to launch stir against SDM,"FARIDKOT: The members of Faridkot Bar Association are up in arms against the Faridkot sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Davinder Singh, as they allege that he misbehaved with some advocates here.

Even as the bar members had complained to the deputy commissioner against the SDM about a month back and had demanded action, the matter was patched up with the intervention of the DC. Recently, after another heated exchange of arguments between the lawyers and the SDM, the bar members have decided to launch an agitation against the SDM.

The advocates alleged that SDMâ€™s behaviour towards the lawyers was contemptuous and humiliating, whenever they appeared in his court. Also, they said the officer generally holds the court proceedings from his retiring room, which is against the rules.

Last Friday, an advocate Mangat Arora appeared in the court of the SDM, in connection with a case. The advocate alleged that despite repeated requests to hear the case, the SDM deliberately ignored him. When the advocate insisted again, a heated exchange ensued between the two. The SDM ordered his gunman to take the advocate out of the court room, but he did not follow the order.

SDM Davinder Singh could not be contacted. Deputy commissioner A Venu Parshad told TNN that though no formal complaint was made, he was aware of the matter. He said he had called the SDM to explain the matter and the latter had told that it was just a misunderstanding.

10,PNB to provide direct know-how to farmers,"LUDHIANA: In what could be a better alternative to the contract farming programme started by Punjab government, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Punjab zone, is trying to clinch deal with some state based processing units to directly provide technical know how to the farmers wanting way out of rice-wheat crop pattern.

Disclosing this in the news conference organised to highlight banks in Punjab zone, achievements in the previous financial year here, PNB general manager U S Bhargava said they were negotiating with two to three units for boosting contract farming by way of facilitating arrangements eliminating any mediating agency.

As per the plans, the bank is working on the idea wherein the farmers produce would be directly lifted by the processing unit as per their desired quality. Contrary to the government programme, the bank is trying to rope in units to come forward to provide technical expertise along with other inputs which in turn ensure that the unit gets exactly the kind of produce required for processing thus eliminating wastage. Stating that they hoped to clinch one or two deals by June, Bhargava pointed out that the programme started by the government was based on priority of providing technical know how.

He informed that they had already written to the state government through chief secretary in October last about the banks plan to contribute in diversification of agriculture that has reached plateau. The purpose behind the initiative was based on guiding philosophy of the founders of PNB that aimed at commercial banking without losing sight of its social obligations, he said adding that the premium on contract farming was an extension of that philosophy in the present scenario.

Talking about kisan credit cards (KCC), Bhargava informed that the feedback at the end of this financial year indicated the success of the idea. In addition to earlier activity specific loan, for instance for buying tractors through this scheme, the GM informed they have provided finance for personal requirements like education of farmers wards after seeing practical utility of the scheme.

Started with purpose of reducing farmers dependence on traditional money lenders through KCC, Bhargava claimed that 90 per cent recovery of loans through the scheme indicated success of the scheme. In the current financial year they expected to cover more eligible farmers under the scheme.

11,Probe selection of 909 secys: Punjab HC to CBI,"CHANDIGARH: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was on Wednesday asked by the Punjab and Haryana high court to investigate the recruitment of 909 panchayat secretaries by the Punjab government during the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party regime in the context of allegations of irregularities and illegalities.

A direction to this effect was given by the division bench of the chief justice Binod Kumar Roy and Justice Harjeet Singh Bedi during the resumed hearing on the petitions preferred by the affected panchayat secretaries seeking directions against the termination of their services by the present Congress regime in the wake of allegations. The bench directed the CBI to complete the probe within a reasonable period while adjourning the hearing to August 13. However, the plea of the petitioner for interim relief by way of staying the termination would be taken up on May 19.

The standing counsel, CBI-cum special public prosecutor Rajan Gupta, submitted that the hands of the CBI were rather full. He also reiterated that in the present case, no central government employee was involved nor it had any inter-state ramification to justify the investigation by the agency. He also pointed out that CBI was in fact over-stretched in terms of resources and funds while making out a case against assigning the case to the CBI. However, the bench in its order said that it appreciated the difficulties of the CBI in so far as resources or funds were concerned, but were optimistic that the CBIâ€™s request to the government of India for more funds, resources etc. would be considered objectively and sympathetically.

The bench also observed that earlier there was delay and some dilly-dallying on the part of the Punjab government but now the state additional advocate general has placed on record a copy of the notification issued under the Special Delhi Police Establishment Act entrusting the investigation of the recruitment of panchayat secretaries to the CBI as required by the law.

12,Gun-toting men chase Bengal PWD minister,"KOLKATA: After state social welfare minister Biswanath Choudhury and Union minister Tapan Sikdar, it was the turn of state PWD minister Amar Chaudhuri to get a taste of the violence that has plagued the run-up to the panchayat polls.

The septuagenarian minister, also a senior RSP leader, had to run for life for over a kilometre and take shelter in a party leaderâ€™s house when gunwielding CPM activists attacked him on Tuesday night at Pakhiralay Ghat in the Sandeshkhali police station area in North 24 Parganas.

Several RSP activists, including the ministerâ€™s securitymen, were hurt while trying to save him.

While Chaudhuri refused to blame the CPM for the attack, RSP state secretary Debabrata Banerjee said on Wednesday that CPM men had attacked Chaudhuri to create panic among RSP supporters before the May 11 polls.

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee claimed Chaudhuriâ€™s presence at the spot was a mere coincidence.

â€œThe copy of his FIR is with me. I have come to know that stones were pelted on the minister. However, his presence at the spot was merely a coincidence. The political affiliation of those involved is not yet clear but I have asked our party leaders to find out,â€� Bhattacharjee told reporters. He said he has directed the police to arrest the culprits, whatever their party affiliation.

The CM, however, called the RSP state secretary in the morning to say that one of the RSP activists, beaten up during the incident, has said in his FIR that CPM men were behind the attack. â€œChaudhuri did not name CPM in his FIR. But the CM called me to say that police were informed of CPMâ€™s involvement,â€� Banerjee said.

CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said he was yet to receive any information that Chaudhuri has been attacked by CPM supporters. â€œI have asked the North 24-Parganas district unit of our party to send a detailed report on the incident. Till I receive it, I can say nothing,â€� he said.

Inspector-general of police Chayan Mukherjee, however, said those who attacked the minister belonged to the CPM. No arrests have been made so far but those responsible have been identified, he said.

According to the FIR filed at the Sandeshkhali police station by Chaudhuri, Safrez Mollah, along with seven others, attacked him as soon as he arrived at Pakhiralay Ghat in the Jeliakhali gram panchayat area in the evening.

Chaudhuri said in his FIR Mollah whipped out a pistol and aimed it at him when he ran for safety. Stones were hurled at the minister.

While Chaudhuri was visibly agitated during his press conference after the attack, his party comrade and former minister Kshiti Goswami was scathing in his remarks at a public meeting in Gosaba. â€œWhat is going on in the state remind us of the terror during the Siddhartha Sankar Ray regime. But this tactic did not succeed that time and it will not succeed this time, too,â€� he said.

18,Disabled students protest DU apathy,"NEW DELHI: Disabled rights activists are up in arms against what they call the discriminatory attitude of Delhi University (DU) authorities and colleges. Many of these activists are DU students. They say the university is not implementing the high courtâ€™s order to provide 3 per cent reservation in jobs to disabled candidates.

University authorities, on the other hand, wash their hands off the issue by saying that the varsity has a federal system and cannot force the issue with the colleges.

A group of disabled students have been holding a dharna outside the V-Câ€™s office for the past fortnight.â€˜â€˜Not only did anybody bother to solve our problem, we were forced to leave the spot,â€™â€™ said Bipin Tiwari, an MPhil student of political science.

Dayal Singh Pawar is a case in point. He is pursuing his PhD in Sanskrit from DU and is visually-impaired. Pawar topped the university in BA in 1992, and then went on to secure the second position in MA in 1995. Despite numerous applications, he is yet to find a job in DU. â€˜â€˜Many of my juniors, whose academic credentials do not even match mine, have found jobs. But I am not good enough for DU,â€™â€™ said Pawar.

DU officials admit the colleges are not recruiting the disabled.

The students now plan to continue the agitation till their demands for the implementation of the HC order are met. After the January 30, 2001 HC order, only three disabled candidates have been recruited for the post of lecturers in colleges.

21,"Shourie, Pandian spat over disinvestment","NEW DELHI: In an unusual exchange, disinvestment minister Arun Shourie on Thursday questioned the propriety of AIADMK member P H Pandian''s asking him â€” from the Speaker''s chair â€” whether Parliament''s authority could be bypassed in matters such as disinvestment of public sector oil companies HPCL and BPCL.

This occurred during a heated discussion on the disinvestment of the oil public sector units (PSUs) under Rule 193 in the Lok Sabha.

With Pandian finding ready support from opposition MPs, Shourie was further riled. First, he said if Parliament''s approval was mandatory, the sale of equity in HPCL and BPCL in 1991 was also illegal. CPM leader Somnath Chatterjee, who was the opening speaker and is a committed opponent of the disinvestment proposal, retorted: ""Are you encouraged by what was done then?""

Later, Shourie again got up to say that such statements should not be made from the chair, stressing that if he (Pandian) had something to say, he should do so in the course of the debate from his seat in Parliament.

Earlier, Pandian, presiding over the proceedings as a member of the panel of chairpersons, asked Shourie: ""Is Parliament''s sanction not necessary for selling PSUs?"" The question found favour with opposition MPs but not with Shourie.

""I will deal with this in great detail in my reply,"" Shourie said after which the debate resumed.
