1,Double murder in upmarket flat,"BANGALORE: Two elderly sisters were found murdered in their seventh-floor flat in High Point I, a stoneâ€™s throw from the High Grounds police station, here on Saturday.

The victims â€” Malati Rao (71), a spinster, and her sister Indu Rajagopalan (64), a widow â€” were smothered to death and had deep laceration marks on the neck, the police said. They were natives of Dakshina Kannada.

Indu was a retired bank official and has two daughters who are settled abroad. Their eldest sister and younger brother had died a few years ago.The two sisters were staying together in the apartment for the last four years while their other sister lives in Richmond Town. They had very few visitors, according to neighbours.

The murder came to light around 10 am on Saturday when their maidservant, Renukamma, entered the house with a spare key she had. Renukamma found one of the victims in the bedroom and the other in the kitchen. Both were dead. The victims had struggled before breathing their last, the police said, adding the assailants might have walked into the house on Friday night. There were no signs of forceful entry.

The police suspect it to be a case of murder for gain as a cupboard was found ransacked but they are yet to ascertain whether valuables had been stolen. Their sister has informed the police that gold valuables are missing.

Residents in the neighbourhood, which has over 100 apartments, are shocked, especially in light of the recent murder of Chitralekha Urs at Palmgrove Nursery located adjacent to the apartment block.

Security arrangements at the apartment block were lax, the police said. The block records the registration numbers of only four-wheelers, and not of two-wheelers, entering the premises. The identity of those coming on foot is also not recorded. The police also suspect that a property litigation, which is pending before court, could have led to the murder.

The bodies have been shifted to Bowring Hospital for postmortem.

3,Iskcon devotees clash with traders,"MAYAPUR: Tension prevailed in the neighbourhood of Iskcon temple on Sunday as shop owners downed their shutters and blocked the main road alleging over 2,000 devotees of the Krishna cult organisation ransacked seven shops, adjoining the temple wall.

According to Superintendent of Police P K Datta, there was dispute on a piece of land between the Iskcon devotees and the shop keepers. But he did not elaborate on the dispute. He said one Iskcon devotee was arrested.

Iskcon refuted the ransack charge of shop owners and claimed a few of the devotees only made verbal protest against the alleged forcible occupation of land by the shop keepers last night.

The mushrooming of such shops close to the main gate had been causing inconveniance to the pilgrims and movement of vehicles, the Iskcon sources said.

Shop owners alleged Iskcon had been trying to evict all shops near temple and bring the land under their possession.

According to reports, the land, owned by PWD, had been the bone of contention between a section of shop owners and the Iskcon for quite some time and matters reached to a head after a new shop came up on a disputed plot.

A large number of devotees stay in the sprawling Mayapur temple compound of Iskcon.
