0,Khalistan ideologues mull political approach,"AMRITSAR: After having failed in achieving the desired goal of Khalistan, a separate Sikh state from India through the use of gun power, the Khalistan ideologues are now reportedly mulling over transforming their ""bloodstained struggle"" into a political one, but with the same aim of secession.

One of the radical Sikh organisations, Dal Khalsa International had already announced to achieve the target of Khalistan through political means.

Though Pakistan government did not give a free hand in allowing their stages to be used by Khalistan leaders to air their fiery statements against India during the 533rd birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, when about 2000 Sikhs from India and other countries had gathered in the gurdwaras of Pakistan, yet few secessionist Sikh leaders considered close to Pak government became successful in keeping the Khalistan flag high in the air.

One of the jatha members informed about the presence of five Sikh militant leaders who were included in the list of 20 fugitives demanded by India from Pakistan post December 13 terror attack on Parliament House.

They are Paramjit Singh Panjwar, chief of Khalistan Commando Force(P), Wadhwa Singh Babbar, president of Babbar Khalsa International, Ranjit Singh Nitta of Khalistan Zindabad Force, Gajinder Singh, president of Dal Khalsa International and Lakhbir Singh Rode of International Sikh Youth Federation.

Notably, Gajinder was too eager to give his interviews to Indian mediapersons during earlier visits to Pakistan. Sources, however, revealed that Pak government had deliberately shifted them to other places and had spread the word that they were not in Pakistan.

Gurmit Singh Aulakh, president of Council of Khalistan during an address at Gurdwara Nanakana Sahib on November 19, spewed venom against Indian government and raised slogans in favour of Khalistan.

He demanded from state''s Congress government to press upon the Centre to call for a plebiscite to settle the future of Khalistan in a democratic manner while censuring the previous Akali government for betraying the cause of Sikh nation.

In a open letter to Capt. Amarinder Singh, chief minister, Punjab, Aulakh asked him to work for the interests of Sikh nation.

Chairman of Nankana Sahib Foundation, Ganga Singh Dhillon during his address said that Sikh struggle for a separate state had not died. He threatened that the Sikh militant leaders could again appear on the scene if Indian government tried to put an obstacle in their political move for Khalistan.

Dhillon, who reportedly has considerable say in the Pak government, is likely to emerge as prominent secessionist Sikh leader after the new government in Pakistan''s Punjab takes shape.

Manmohan Singh Khalsa, a UK-based Sikh has reportedly founded a World Muslim Sikh Federation to further the cause of Khalistan. Pritpal Singh Khalsa of Switzerland, a staunch Khalistan supporter demanded funds for making representations to UN in support of Khalistan.

Meanwhile, reports reaching here suggest that ISI personnel tried to emotionally blackmail the visiting Indian Sikhs by provoking them against Hindus.

1,Arrest politically motivated: Gurdev,"LUDHIANA: Former SAD minister Gurdev Singh Badal has said that his arrest was politically motivated. Badal, who is in police custody, told TNN that the Congress government had taken this step out of frustration since his son and SGPC vice-president Kewal Singh Badal had been rescued by SAD president Parkash Singh Badal from his Jagraon residence where he was detained by the police before recently concluded SGPC elections.

Badal told that he was in the bed after taking medicine when the vigilance staff swooped down on his residence at about 10 in the evening.

The security personnel alighted from three vehicles and surrounded his Harindra Nagar residence. DSP Vigilance Bureau, Ludhiana Charanjit Singh had reportedly led a big posse of security men to arrest him.

""I was not informed about any charges levelled against me. The officer simply told me that I was under arrest,"" Badal said adding that he was brought in police vehicle to Ludhiana at about midnight.

The accused Akali leader complained that he was also made to stand during the police custody at both Sadar police station and local vigilance bureau office before producing him before the duty magistrate.

Badal said he had already moved an application at the Sessions court at Ropar in August with the request that he be given notice before his arrest.

""I had also mentioned in the application that would volunteer arrest if required so. The vigilance department had informed the court that I was not wanted in any case,"" Badal said.

2,"A victim of vendetta politics, says Badal","CHANDIGARH: Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal said here on Sunday that former SAD minister Gurdev Singh Badal had fallen victim to chief minister Amarinder Singh''s ""vendetta politics"".

He said Gurdev had been booked in the Vigilance case for ""an obvious reason that his son refused to join the government''s camp in the SGPC election.""

Badal said the chief minister was ""indulging in the kind of filthy idiom used only by depraved criminals.""

The chief minister had injected dangerous confrontationist stance in the state polity which could have serious implications in days to come, Badal added.

While the chief minister had no time for governance, he was pursuing a petty personal agenda of vendetta. Badal said the chief minister speaks the language of ""supari killers and behaves as if his office was that of a mafia don.""

He said the situation in the state had become delicate with utterly irresponsible statements of the chief minister.

Badal also took exception to the chief minister''s reported remarks about the Akalis during AICC president Sonia Gandhi''s visit to the city and said the chief minister was challenging the SAD leaders for confrontation with the government which the party would not buy.

3,"Serve poor, minister urges pvt hospitals","HUBLI: Karnataka Medical Education Minister A.B. Maalaka Raddy on Sunday conceded that government hospitals in the state were unable to provide facilities on par with private hospitals.

The government hospitals neither have the resources to construct sophisticated facilities nor was the government in a position to pay high salaries to doctors as paid in private hospitals, he told reporters here on Sunday.

Raddy, who earlier inaugurated the new ICU unit at the KLE Societies Hospital here, said private hospitals should provide free treatment to 25 per cent of patients and serve the poor. The medical education minister said private hospitals need to be more service-minded rather than being money-minting centres.

Speaking on upgradation of government hospitals, Raddy said general hospitals in Hubli and Bellary would be soon provided with modern scanning equipment.

Water Resources Minister H.K. Patil, MP I.G. Sanadi, MLCs Basavaraj Horatti, Prabhakar Kore and Gangadhara Ragayogendra Swami of Moorusavira Math participated in the inaugural function of the hospital.

4,Pressure on Chiranjeevi to start party,"HYDERABAD: Telugu film star Chiranjeevi is coming under pressure from close family members and associates to start a political party. Some prominent politicians are trying to convince the reluctant star to take the plunge right now since his latest film Indra has become a record hit.

According to informed sources, well-known film director and Congress MP Dasari Narayana Rao and Chiranjeevi had marathon parleys some time ago on the nitty-gritty of starting a political party. Rao even offered to give up his Rajya Sabha seat and quit the Congress to help Chiranjeevi launch a political outfit.

The mega starâ€™s father-in-law, veteran actor Allu Ramalingaiah, recently gave some clue of the familyâ€™s intentions when he said at a felicitation function that Chiranjeevi should enter politics.

Some of the starâ€™s associates are now engaged in the task of identifying at least 20 important political leaders in the district belonging to different castes and communities so that the new political outfit would not be labelled a casteist party. This core group reportedly held informal meetings and consultations with prominent political figures and is said to have elicited assurances from them that they would bid goodbye to their present parties and join Chiranjeevi whenever the star enters politics. Efforts are also on to revive a defunct Telugu newspaper to serve as a platform for the party.

Dasari has also tested the political temperature on his own. One leader who met the director told The Times of India that Team Chiranjeevi was anticipating an exodus from both Telugu Desam Party and Congress to the new party.

Chiranjeeviâ€™s family members and leaders feel that the time is opportune for a political entry. â€œHe might not get another hit like Indra . He must start a new political party now,â€™â€™ a person close to the star said.

Even though some observers state that Chiranjeevi may not start a party as long as chief minister Chandrababu Naidu is in power â€” they have a cordial relationship â€” the pressure on the actor might force him to do a rethink.

The star had some time ago told Naidu during a conversation that he was not keen on politics. If every thing goes according to schedule, the new party will take birth in the latter half of next year.

5,Gurdev amassed Rs 1 cr assets as minister,"LUDHIANA/CHANDIGARH: Duty magistrate DP Singla on Sunday sent former Punjab agriculture minister and senior SAD leader, Gurdev Singh Badal, to a day''s police remand in a disproportionate assets case during his five year tenure as minister.

The accused will be produced before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) on Monday. Earlier, vigilance staff raided Gurdev''s Faridkot residence at about 10 pm, on Saturday evening, and brought him to Ludhiana around midnight. He was kept at Sadar police station for rest of the night before detaining him at SP vigilance office here.

A case under section 13(1)E, 13(2)D and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered against the former minister at police station, Vigilance Bureau, Patiala Range, on Saturday. According to vigilance officials, the former minister was found guilty on account of having amassed assets worth Rs 1.07 crore including luxury cars, gold and bank deposits during his tenure as minister.

The accused had spent Rs 50 lakh on the construction of a plot measuring 500 square yards near Barewal village near here. Besides, he had got underground pipes laid on 26 acre land by state soil conservation department without making any payment at Bhaini Arian village near here.

Gurdev had purchased ten marla plot and constructed a house in Panjgarin and another 20 canals of land in his own name besides 16 canals in his grandson''s name. Also, he has agricultural land in Gairsian, Kahn Mohamd, Ghunewal and Bhaini Araiana villages.

Searches were also carried out at Jagraon and Sidhwan. However, he reacted by saying that he was suffering from high blood pressure and a cardiac problem. The judge then ordered the prosecution to get the Gurdev''s medical check up. After this, Badal was again produced before the DM at his residence at about 5 pm.

Pleading for judicial custody, Gurdev''s defence counsel said his client enjoyed respectable position and had the distinction of contesting 11 assembly elections successfully. His plea was that his client does not possess any hidden sources of income apart from agricultural property.

The case was blindly registered with the motive of political revenge, the defence counsel pleaded, adding that the client was not taken to the civil hospital for medical examination. A doctor had, however, been called to the vigilance bureau office to examine Gurdev.

Moreover, no evidence was produced suggesting any illegality in property possessed by his client, besides he was produced beyond 24 hours after his arrest. Hence, there was no ground for sending him to police custody, the counsel pleaded.

The defence counsel also pleaded that the court should allow him to meet the client during interrogation. The judge referred the application in this regard to be decided by the CJM.

The public prosecutor, Rajiv Kochhar, while objecting to this pleaded that defence counsel''s fears were unfounded particularly in light of Punjab and Haryana High Court instructions against using third degree methods on the accused.

Kochhar pleaded for 14 days police remand because investigation needed time to probe the bank accounts and lockers belonging to the accused.

6,ML's five-day party congress begins on Monday,"PATNA: CPI(ML-Liberation) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya will inaugurate the open session of the partyâ€™s seventh congress here at the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir on Monday afternoon.

More than 800 delegates, as well as guests who are also participants in the â€œinternational anti-imperialist movementâ€�, have assembled here to chart out the course of a â€œpowerful communist resurgence, for a strong and united left and democratic counter offensive against the saffron design of fascist subversionâ€�.

â€œWe look forward to your wholehearted support and solidarity to fulfil this task and carry forward the march to a new democratic India, a socialist India,â€� says a party folder distributed among more than 500 distinguished citizens of the state.

Talking to mediapersons here on Sunday, senior party leaders Swadesh Bhattacharya, Ram Jatan Sharma and Ram Naresh Ram explained that foreign delegates from Workers Party (Norway), Democratic Socialist Party (Australia), South Asia Solidarity Group (London), International South Asian Forum (Canada) and Communist Party of Nepal (ML) have already arrived to participate in the open session.

Several delegates from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are expected to arrive Monday morning, they added.

During the five-day congress, a Sydney-based group â€œArt and Resistanceâ€� will screen documentaries on the peopleâ€™s movement in Palestine, Indonesia and other countries.

According to them, veteran octogenerian communist leader Ramakant Dwivedi â€˜Ramataâ€™ will hoist the flag. The party has decided to honour at least two dozen veteran communists from Bihar on this occasion.

A cultural programme has also been organised on the inaugural day. Jayanta Rongpi, MP and a central committee member, will introduce the foreign guests.

The party has rechristened Patna as Vinod Mishra Nagar for the five-day congress. The open-air theatre of the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir has been named after late Chandrashekhar, while the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir auditorium will be called Taqi Rahim Sabhagar.

7,Youth makes unique art piece for ML congress,"PATNA: A unique piece of art, made of plaster of Paris and depicting peasant revolt in the backdrop of the Naxalite movement, which is to be placed before the entrance gate of the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir Monday morning, is the result of 20-day hard work of a talented artist from Ekchari village in Bhagalpur district.

He is 29-year-old Manoj Pankaj, now associated with â€œKala Communeâ€� at Varanasi. He was drafted to make this unique piece of art specially for the Patna congress of the CPI (ML-Liberation). Pankaj has done his masters in fine arts from Benares Hindu University (BHU) in sculpture, besides completing courses in painting and Sanskrit.

Asked about the concept behind this art piece, he said that it had been made keeping in mind the ideology of the party. It has depicted five working class people, including two women (one carrying a child), in marching position against the prevalent feudal and oppressive forces. Pankaj has also made a statue of late Vinod Mishra at Begusarai.

The president also awarded him the all-India Fine Arts and Crafts Society prize in 2000 for his outstanding work. Of late, Kala Commune is being regarded as one of the most progressive group of artists. Pankaj, alongwith Onkar, has been busy putting into place this piece of art for the last 20 days.

It will be placed on a trolley for five days at the entrance gate of the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir from Monday morning. The party has also given him additional responsibility of interior decoration of the auditorium of the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir, the main venue of the congress.

More than 50 talented artists, belonging to Kolkata, Varanasi, Delhi and Patna, have been assigned the art and design work of the publicity materials of the congress. They have done decoration work on at least half a dozen institutions, hoardings and important locations, including Patna junction, income-tax roundabout and JP roundabout near Hotel Maurya in the backdrop of the CPI(ML) congress to begin from Monday.

Students of Brahmanand Art College, Darbhanga, have also made more than two dozen Madhubani paintings on the theme of peopleâ€™s movement. They would be presented to the visiting foreign delegates. For the first time, the party has decided to present them as a gift from Bihar.

8,"NCP-Cong govt must go, says Sena-BJP","MUMBAI: Citing a ""total collapse"" of law and order in the state, the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance on Sunday called for the dismissal of the Democratic Front government.

The saffron combine is incensed by the attack on Sena leader Narayan Rane''s house at Kankavali in Sindhudurg district on Saturday by a mob of NCP activists and the justification of the violence by deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal.

An NCP activist, Satyavijay Bhise, was murdered, allegedly by Shiv Sainiks, on Friday night after which NCP activists set Mr Rane''s house and other properties on fire.

Mr Bhujbal, who is in charge of the home portfolio, stated that the anger of his party members was understandable considering the fact that Shiv Sainiks had brutally murdered Bhise.

He said Bhise was murdered since his brother had been recently elected to the zilla parishad defeating a nominee of Mr Rane, Rajan Teli. The Sena has a strong hold over the Konkan belt and this is sought to be challenged by the NCP. The situation in Kankavali was tense but under control on Sunday.

A Sena-BJP delegation led by Uddhav Thackeray and Nitin Gadkari on Sunday called on governor Mohammed Fazal and submitted a memorandum demanding that the DF government be sacked and President''s rule imposed in the state.

""Never in the history of the state has a home minister justified violence. Mr Bhujbal''s justification of the mob attack on Mr Rane''s house shows the government''s complicity in the violence. The safety of the common man will be in jeopardy if this government is allowed to continue,"" he said.

BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Gopinath Munde, who is touring Nashik, also denounced Mr Bhujbal''s statement. At the same time, he condemned Bhise''s murder.

12,'Godmother' in fray for polls,"AHMEDABAD: In a move that sent ripples through political circles in Porbandar, ''Godmother'' Santokben Sarmanbhai Jadeja filed her nomination on Monday from the Kutiyana seat of Porbander district as an Independent. She was earlier a Janata Dal MLA in 1990.

The central character in the film ''Godmother'', which was played by Shabana Azmi, was based on Santokben''s life. Incidentally, she was not happy with the way she was potrayed in the film.

Santokben, the widow of Porbander strongman Sarman Munja who was killed in a gang warfare many years back, still evokes awe and respect in Porbander.

Significantly, Bhura Munja, her brother-in-law and former MLA, filed his nomination as a Samajwadi Party candidate for the same seat. Bhura, who was released from jail recently, had tried for a Congress ticket but was unsuccessful.

Both Santokben and Munja have considerable influence over the Mer community in Porbander and could give the Congress candidate Bharat Mahant and the BJP candidate Karsan Adedaria a tough time ahead.

13,Adsul lambasts govt for decision over LDBs,"PUNE: Unhappy with the ""arbitrary"" decisions taken by the Maharashtra government recently, the Union minister of state for finance, Anand Adsul, on Sunday said the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (Nabard) will be soon sending a notice to the state for closing down land development banks without consulting the Centre.

Speaking to mediapersons at a meet-the-press programme organised by the Pune Union of Working Journalists, Adsul said the decision of the state government to liquidate all the 18 LDBs in the state was unilateral and had far-reaching consequences.

He said chief minister Vilasrao Deshmkh''s decision to bring LDBs under liquidation will have a direct bearing on the lending to farmers. The state government did not even think about the impending repayment of a Rs 1,000-crore loan taken by the LDBs from Nabard before closing them down, he deplored.

""Since the state was a guarantor to the loan, it will have to explain why the Central agency or the ministry was not consulted before closing down,"" he said.

He also accused Deshmukh of derailing the deliberations held to bail out the LDBs. Adsul said he had suggested to the unions in the 18 LDBs to file a suit against the state government for this short-sighted decision. ""After all, the LDBs employed more than 5,000 persons,"" he said.

The minister said the Industrial Development Bank of India, too, had recently sent a notice to the state government for its failure to honour a Rs 700-crore loan.

Adsul also criticised the Deshmukh government for its dubious attempt at shifting the blame for the fall in the price of sugar.

Although the Centre had allowed sugar co-operatives in the state to export their produce, a majority of the co-operatives diverted their stocks to the domestic market, he said. He also blamed the state government of softpedalling the sugar export scam.

The Shiv Sena minister was quick to cite the excise recovery made by the Central department against 19 co-operative sugar factories in the state, found guilty of diverting export-sugar into the Indian market.

Significantly, Adsul said Gingee Ramachandran, Union minister of state for revenue, has ordered a thorough inquiry into the sugar export orders cleared by the Centre between 2000 and 2002.

Adsul said Ramchandran has asked the chairman of the Central Board of Excise and Customs, M K Zutshi, to file a comprehensive report within a month''s time on the diversion of export-quota sugar by factories in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

However, Adsul said the Centre will definitely work on some bailout package to resolve the sugar crisis, for the benefit of farmers and the cooperative sugar industry at large.

Last but not the least, the minister in reply to a query, said the recentlypassed Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets Bill will help banks recover bad loans.

14,Pandya's services could be used for party work: Agrawal,"AHMEDABAD: BJP national treasurer Ramdas Agrawal on Monday said former minister of state for revenue Haren Pandya, who voluntarily gave up his demand to be nominated from the Ellisbridge assembly constituency on Sunday night, could be drafted for party work after the elections.

He admitted the issue of Pandya should have been settled much earlier. However, he said, the party leaders have taken note of Pandya''s ''disciplined attitude'' and his services could be used for the party work.

Asked why Pandya''s candidature became controversial, Agrawal cited several ''finer points'' of the former minister''s differences with Chief Minister Narendra Modi, apart from the allegation that Pandya had deposed before the Concerned Citizen''s Tribunal after the riots.

Agrawal, however, declined to divulge details of the same, but said Pandya had already denied the charge that he deposed before any tribunal. The party has not arrived at any ''conclusion'' on this issue, he added.

15,"Ex-minister Jaspal changes party, constituency","VADODARA: Former minister of state for jails, Jaspal Singh, has finally thrown his hat into the election ring. This time the maverick politician has not only switched his party, but also his constituency.

Singh filed his nomination for the Wadi-City constituency in Vadodara on a Samata Party ticket on Monday. The party had earlier planned to field deputy mayor and city unit president Shailesh Mehta ''Sotta'' for the seat, but settled for Singh after parleys with him over his candidature were successful.

In the Sayajigunj assembly by-elections held earlier this year, Singh had contested as a Samajwadi Party candidate and fared so badly that he even lost his deposit. The general speculation at that time was that the defeat would end his political career.

However, after lying low for about eight months, Singh was in the limelight again after participating in the annual Narsinhji''s procession in the city last week.

Meanwhile, Mehta reacted to Singh''s candidature by saying that the state parliamentary board of his party had asked him to consider Singh as a candidate instead of himself. ""We agreed to the decision. Now the idea is to ensure Singh''s victory,"" Mehta said.

16,Centre clarifies forest land encroachment policy,"MUMBAI: The Union environment ministry has sent a letter to states clarifying that people who had encroached on forest land before 1980 continue to be eligible to have their homes.

Earlier this year, the ministry had issued a directive that all forest land must be cleared of encroachments by September end. The order sparked massive eviction drives all over the country, leading to mass protests by tribals and others.

Several tribal representatives had claimed that the evictions were even targeting decades-old forest dwellers. In Maharashtra, after widespread protests the chief minister temporarily halted the drive.

Now, in a letter dated October 30, the ministry has made it clear that the order is not meant to supersede earlier guidelines which permit pre-1980 encroachments.

In response to requests from a number of organisations to stop the evictions, the ministry clarifies that ""there is no change in the policy with regard to regularisation of pre-1980 eligible encroachments and the commitment with reference to forest-tribal interface on the disputed settlement claims.""

The 1990 guidelines had also addressed some of the complexities involved in identifying encroachers, including the fact that many indigenous communities lacked documents of proof and that land surveys had not been conducted in many areas.

In the letter, the ministry advises the states to consider setting up committees composed of three departmentsâ€” tribal, revenue and forestâ€” at the district level to settle disputed claims.While emphasising that the states must also show progress on the eviction of non-eligible encroachments, especially in cases where the land has been converted to agricultural and other uses, it adds that they are free to rehabilitate the encroachers according to the stateâ€™s policy.

State governments may also consider economic rehabilitation by involving encroachers in forestry activities through joint forest management programmes, it points out.

Commenting on the governmentâ€™s letter, Ashish Kothari of the Pune-based Kalpavriksh said, ""It certainly helps because it takes us back to the 1990 circulars as the basis for deciding things. But it is still not a perfect situation.""

He pointed out that the committees recommended by the ministry have only government officials on them, but no representatives of local communities.

""However, the ministry has indicated that the states have the freedom to bring in additional items.""

The issue will be further influenced by the orders in an on- going supreme court case on forest evictions. The next hearing is scheduled for the end of this month.

17,FICCI asks Govt to revamp food procurement policy,"NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has asked the government to make a number of changes in traditional agriculture and the food procurement policy.

A presentation in this regard at the Prime Minister''s residence here on Saturday was attended by Vajpayee, senior ministers and officials. The PM, it appears, asked FICCI to lobby in this regard with state governments, too.

FICCI president R S Lodha was accompanied by a number of prominent business heads in the agro sector, such as P M Sinha, Hardeep Singh and Gokul Patnaik.

Their aim, said the FICCI team, is to make Indian agriculture globally competitive. Their `task force'' presentation (TFP) asks for market-driven reforms in production, pricing, procurement and distribution and encouragement for private enterprise in all stages.

It asked for minimum support prices to be restored to just that, with recommendations on their level to be mandatory. Food Corporation of India is to be a last-resort buyer, instead of the other way round. Indirect subsidies should be entirely replaced with a unit cash subsidy. And food security/relief procuring should be delinked from support price operations.

The banking system should be used to funnel subsidies, in the form of food stamps or cash, instead of the present ration-shop system. There are also recommendations on how to support a three to five-year transition period, ensuring political appeal and social equity.

It urged the government to move forward with plans to end the various state clamps in the Essential Commodities Act and the Agriculture Produce Market Committee Act and to harmonise various rules and standards and enforcement agencies in the processed foods sector. It strongly recommends one omnibus Food Act, replacing the many now administered by nine different ministries.

Besides commodity exchanges and futures markets, it also asks for use of computer technology on a wide scale to empower farmers and consumers.

18,Attari tense as police action sparks protest,"ATTARI, Amritsar: Tension gripped the sleepy town of Attari, situated about 26 kilometer from Amritsar, just close to the Indo-Pak border after its residents shut their establishments for the whole day and blocked the traffic for about five hours protesting against the alleged highhandedness of police.

Reports suggest that police unleashed a â€œspate of terrorâ€� on its residents on Sunday night and arrested ten persons whereas two ladies including a pregnant one had to be admitted to the hospital after being allegedly thrashed by the police force there to conduct raids at the residence of two rickshaw-pullers on receiving information that they were involved in the illegal liquor trade.

Women from the town gheraoed the Gharinda police station and Kahangarh chowki on Monday whereas men folk blocked the Amritsar-Wagah GT Road.

According to Gurbinder Singh Sidhu, a panchayat member, Attari, Avtar Singh, SHO, police station Gharinda and Amolak Singh, incharge, police chowki Kahangarh, Havildar Manjinder Singh and Munshi Kashmir Singh along with police force first raided the houses of rickshaw-pullers Boota Singh and Surjit Singh.

After facing resistance from their wives Gurdeep Kaur and Paramjit Kaur respectively, the police allegedly thrashed both of them. This act of police incited the people and they took to the streets, said Sidhu. He said police also raided the house of sarpanch Hardev Singh Lalli who had asked policemen to take a panchayat member along with them before conducting any raid in the village.

Lalli reportedly managed to escape and the police allegedly manhandled his octogenarian father Preetam Singh. The blockade was lifted only after the intervention of DSP (Rural), Sandeep Kumar Sharma and other higher civil administration officers who assuaged the feelings of the people and assured them of inquiry against policemen.

While talking to TNN, Sharma denied any police highhandedness. He, however, said the police had specific information before conducting raids.

19,Terrorists freed without govt's consent: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Even as both Houses of Parliament on Monday pledged to stand united in the country''s battle against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, the prevailing consensus fell apart when Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani told the Lok Sabha that the Jammu and Kashmir government did not consult the Centre before releasing the militants in custody.

Advani made this disclosure while replying to members'' queries in the LS, stating that not only did the state government act unilaterally but the Union home secretary even sent a letter to the new administration in J&K that such decisions which have a bearing on the country''s battle against terrorism should be taken after consultating the Centre.

This revelation clearly discomfitted the Congress since it is a partner in the coalition government in J&K. Congress deputy leader Shivraj Patil sought to put the record straight, saying that intelligence agencies were consulted before releasing the militants to which Advani replied that these agencies are not involved in such matters.

The two Houses later passed separate formal resolutions of outrage at Sunday''s terrorist attacks at Jammu''s Raghunath temple and thanks to the security forces for killing those who did it, after Advani gave a detailed account of the incident for which he held Pakistan responsible.

Sunday''s attacks, and a similar one in March, are part of a ``deliberate design to create a communal divide in J&K'''', Advani told both Houses. ``These terorrists have demonstrated their total lack of concern for the overwhelming yearning for peace (shown) in the recent assembly elections.''''

Referring to the series of attacks by `suicide squads'' of terrorists in the state over the last three days, Advani noted that these followed the release by the Pakistan government of the chief of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hafiz Mohammed Sayeed, and his subsequent publicised vow to continue the jehad in J&K.

``Monitoring of the communication network of the terrorists indicates the Jammu attack is the handiwork of Al Mansooran, a cover organisation of the Lashkar-e-Taiba,'''' Advani said.

The statements followed a disruption of question hour, the first item of Parliament''s agenda, as it began, by agitated MPs demanding a discussion on the killings. Calm was restored after about 10 minutes only, with the promise of Advani''s statement, and clarifications thereafter.

The LS allowed members to have their say on the matter for around three hours after the statement while the Rajya Sabha decided to have this later and to end the day with the resolution of outrage/condolence.

There were angry statements in the LS by members on both sides, with ruling NDA supporters demanding tough action against terrorists and against their Pakistan-based sponsors. Congress and other opposition members said the government''s policy on J&K was not effective at all. Both sides demanded clear results, and fast, in suppressing terrorism and the endless violence on innocent people.

Advani told the LS that India was constantly trying to impress upon the international community that Pakistan''s ISI is a major source of terrorism, adding that though the US understands this, it also feels that General Musharraf is ``their best bet'''' in their fight against terrorism.

Advani also denied that the deployment of forces had served no useful purpose. He said it had forced Musharraf to state that he will not allow terrorist groups to operate from Pakistan and that it will end infiltration. He said they did not believe Pakistan as the ground situation had remained unchanged.

20,Panjab varsity reader commits suicide,"CHANDIGARH: Nikhil Syal (54), a reader in the department of physical education and swimming coach at Panjab University, committed suicide by jumping from the second floor of his Sector 15 house on Monday morning. Nikhilâ€™s wife, Pushpinder Syal, is a professor in PUâ€™s department of English.

Syal had apparently used a ladder to climb the parapet on the second floor terrace and jumped in a way that his head hit the ground. He had suffered a head injury and was referred to PGIâ€™s neurology department.

The incident came to notice when neighbours saw Nikhil lying in the open space adjacent to his house. Nikhilâ€™s son, who was at home, rushed him to PGI where doctors, after failing to revive him for some time, declared him dead.

Syal left behind a suicide note, which was found from his pocket, addressed to the station house officer of Sector 11 police station (his house falls under the jurisdiction of this police station). In his suicide note he had mentioned that no one should be held responsible for this act and he was committing suicide as he has â€˜â€˜lived enough.â€™â€™

Family members are yet to come to terms with the loss and are finding it hard to find the possible motive for his taking such a step. â€˜â€˜We have no idea why he did this,â€™â€™ said the deceasedâ€™s father-in-law. â€˜â€˜Even this morning, he prepared tea and had it with his family and the incident took place after my daughter left for work. I was informed by my grandson,â€™â€™ he added.

Family members told TNN that Syal, as usual, had gone to the university gymnasium and even visited the swimming pool. He stayed at home most of the time as the pool is closed these days.

Nikhil has two sons, one of whom works in Mumbai while the other is doing his graduation. The police has started inquest proceedings in the case and the post-mortem will be conducted on Tuesday.

23,Headless income tax wing can’t raid evaders,"NEW DELHI: There is good news for tax evaders in Delhi. The investigation department of the income-tax is without a chief since Bhagwat Swarup was promoted as a member to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), more than a month ago.

Sources in the I-T department said though on paper Swarup still holds the additional charge of director-general investigation, in reality a member does not have the time to get a search planned and executed. â€˜â€˜Since the time Swarup was shifted, not one raid has been conducted in the city,â€™â€™ said an official.

An order reportedly issued by the CBDT has made it mandatory for searches in any city to be approved by the director-general of investigation in charge of that particular city. â€˜â€˜In Delhi they expect a CBDT member to give us orders to conduct searches. It is the member (investigation) to whom the D-Gs (investigations) in the country report. It is not possible for him to run the show in a city like Delhi,â€™â€™ said an official.

Senior officials in the investigation department said the CBDT and the finance ministry are to be blamed for this â€˜â€˜irresponsible behaviourâ€™â€™. â€˜â€˜The members knew that Swarup was going to be promoted and they should have found a new D-G just before he was moved to North Block,â€™â€™ said an official. The primary duty of the investigation wing is to detect illegal investments and black money and then to slap tax demands based on these.

â€˜â€˜Although the Diwali season has passed and the market is full of illegal money we have been forced to sit idle and searches, even in cases where we had information of tax evasion worth crores, have not been conducted,â€™â€™ said an income-tax official.

There are seven additional and joint directors in the investigation wing in Delhi. They are supposed to â€˜â€˜develop a caseâ€™â€™ and discuss it with the D-G. The D-G then gives the â€˜go-aheadâ€™ and also keeps the CBDT and finance ministry informed about the searches to be carried out.

Investigation wing sources said there are senior officials â€” like 28 deputy directors, 18 income-tax officers (ITO), about 75 inspectors and 50 lower staff â€” who have been without work for over a month now.
