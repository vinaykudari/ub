0,SGPC officials violate rules to allot shops,"AMRITSAR: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) officials have allegedly allotted one shop of Guru Arjun Dev Niwas located in the SGPC complex by violating rules.

The shop, that could have fetched around Rs 1 lakh as donation and a monthly rent of around Rs 5,000, was allotted at a rent of Rs 1,500 per month only without any advance, sources said.

One Amarjit Kaur had applied for the allotment of a shop for opening a STD/ PCO booth in Guru Arjun Dev Niwas, to the president of the committee but the application allegedly never reached him and the secretary of the committee Harbeant Singh on August 28, on his own, sought a report from Ajaib Singh, manager Golden Temple regarding allotting the shop, sources said.

The manager in his report submitted on September 20 recommended a monthly rent of Rs 1,000, which was, however later increased to Rs 1,500 by Harbeant Singh. While the application should have been forwarded to the president of the property sub committee that recommends its decision to executive body for its final approval.

The executive body generally favours open auction of any shop to be allotted. Sources said that none of the above procedures was followed.

Interestingly the item for allotment of shop was not included in the printed agenda given to executive members before their meeting on September 24 even when there was sufficient time to do so. A resolution to this effect was reportedly passed without discussion in the meeting and the same was dispatched to the manager for further action on October 2.

Sukhdev Singh Bharu, executive member of SGPC told Times News Network that no such item was discussed in the executive committee meeting.

Blaming the concerned SGPC officials for their alleged favouritism and deceitful practices, he said he would take up the issue of keeping the SGPC executive members in the dark and in violation of SGPC rules in the meeting being held on Monday.

He said that earlier a STD/PCO booth was allotted on a donation of Rs 50,000 and a monthly rent of Rs 4,200 couple of years ago.

1,New herbal farm in Rashtrapati Bhavan,"NEW DELHI: Famous for its Mughal Garden with exquisite flowers, Rashtrapati Bhavan is going herbal too. President A P J Abdul Kalam on Thursday planted the first saplings at the new herbal farm in the Presidentâ€™s estate that will also house a gene bank and a greenhouse for rare and endangered medicinal plants.

Kalam planted the saplings of Santalum album (chandan) and Ocimun sanctum (tulsi). Interacting with officials of the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, he said it was necessary to save from extinction many of the indegenous medicinal plant species.

He emphasised the need to link traditional wisdom about medicinal plants, which is in the form of ancient writings, with modern science so that the country can take advantage of its bio-diversity by producing the best and latest drugs using extracts of herbal plants.

A brainchild of the President, this project will be used for educating children by giving them a glimpse of the value addition process leading to finished marketable products.

The herbal farm has an area of 10 acres in three different locations within the Presidentâ€™s estate. While it will be developed in a phased manner, it will ultimately be home to many species of medicinal and aromatic plants.

These areas are being landscaped and laid out to facilitate the demonstration of the value addition process and add to the aesthetics of the estate.

2,HC not to stay lawyer's arrest,"LUCKNOW: The high court here on Thursday refused to stay the arrest of Sushil Kumar, a lawyer of Shahjahanpur allegedly involved in making forged letters and possessing illegal document seals of several dignitaries.

A division bench of the high court comprising Justice Khemkaran and Justice RC Pandey after considering the allegation made in the FIR that mentions the cognisable offenses, has dismissed the petition filed by Shushil Kumar, challenging the validity of the FIR.

Opposing the petition, state counsel BK Nigam contended that the CB-CID after making an enquiry had lodged an FIR on December 12, 2001 against the petitioner at police station Hazratganj. It was alleged that the petitioner had made forged letters of the then special secretary to chief minister of UP Shailesh Krishna by putting his fake signature.

3,Sourav Ganguly invites CM to party,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been asked out to a party by the Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly at the cityâ€™s newest five-star hotel.

The bash, on the second day of the final Test match against the Windies, will be hosted by the Indian Cricketersâ€™ Association that will be formed a couple of days before the fund-raising dinner.

The proceeds of this will go to charities and for the benefit of first-class cricketers. Headed by suave former India opener Arun Lal, the big do will have the West Indies and Indian players as well as the glitterati of Kolkata in attendance.

But watch this space for more details of who pays to eat and who doesnâ€™t. According to well-placed Writersâ€™ Buildings sources, Sourav called Buddhababu to extend the invitation. And the chief minister , it is learnt, is keen to break bread with the cricketers. Later on, speaking to The Times of India, Arun Lal confirmed: â€œA formal announcement with regard to the formation of the Indian Cricketersâ€™ Association will be made on October 29, while the fund-raising dinner is scheduled for October 31.â€� Lal further said: â€œThe charity dinner will be an attempt to raise funds which will be distributed among various charitable organisations in the country. We will invite several former India players, the entire touring West Indies side, people from the corporate and media world and also several state ministers and other local dignitaries. Members of the current Indian team will of course be there as well.â€�

Asked about how viable a playersâ€™ body can be, Piggy (as Arun Lal is fondly known) commented: â€œItâ€™s not so much a question of â€˜viabilityâ€™ as it is of â€˜necessityâ€™. Right through my playing days and even now, Iâ€™ve always felt the need for a playersâ€™ body and many others have shared the same view with me.â€�

Interestingly, the 1989-formed Association of Indian Cricketers, the first playersâ€™ union of which Arun Lal was the secretary, had failed to gain wings. This was largely due to a lack of commitment from the then Indian players. He reiterated: â€œThis isnâ€™t a confrontationist but a complementary unit to the cricket board. Letâ€™s make that very clear.â€�

4,Mulayam to partymen: Throw out this govt,"LUCKNOW: Stating that the Uttar Pradesh government had been reduced to a minority, Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on Thursday asked his partymen to strike when the iron was hot.

He exhorted them to throw the present dispensation out of power while directing them to end groupism in the party.

In an impromptu address near the main gate of the party office ,Yadav asked the partymen to recognise their strength. He told the workers the day they would decide to throw the government out, it would cease to exist .He said the commonman''s faith in the government had ended and people were desirous of a change . The time has come to strike the iron while it was hot,he exhorted partymen.

Directing them to put an end to the groupism in the party he reiterated his resolve not to allow mid-term assembly polls in UP. Both Atal Behari Vajpayee and LK Advani were desirous that the coalition government in UP continued in office as the Parliamentary elections were close by,he added. He lashed out at chief minister Mayawati for emptying the state exchequer on projects like the Ambedkar Park which did not benefit the poor and downtrodden in any way. It would have been better if schools and hospitals had been constructed from that money, he said.

Patting the workers for observing the ''Thu-Thu diwas'' in retaliation to the BSPs ''Dhikkar Rally'' Yadav said Mayawati did not have the guts to visit the injured admitted to the hospital in the stampede at the Charbagh railway station.She visited them after three days, he added.

Earlier addressing the district/city presidents and heads of the various cells Yadav asked them to strengthen the party organisation as they formed a very important link.Asking them to work like an extended family he exhorted them to be prepared for every kind of struggle.

Cautioning the partymen against indiscipline,Mulayam said every worker had a right to air his view but once a decision was taken by the party all members had to adhere to it.

Referring to party''s committment to give unemployment allowance when in power, Yadav asked partymen to be on guard as hardliners were gaining ascendency in the BJP. He said the SP was the only party which could take such people head on.

5,"NCERT, ICHR chiefs clash over history textbooks","NEW DELHI: An open clash has ensued between two autonomous bodies under the HRD ministry. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has accused the Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) chairman MGS Narayanan of lending his ears to the â€˜â€˜whispering campaignâ€™â€™ against the council and its works.

It was reacting to his advice that the government should not be writing history textbooks for school students Appointed ICHR chairman earlier this year, Narayanan had made his views known at a conference earlier this week. In a stinging rejoinder, NCERT director B S Rajput said on Thursday: â€˜â€˜We can appreciate Prof Narayananâ€™s concern that government should not publish history textbooks. But we are surprised to note that he had participated in a previous NCERT exercise by joining the editorial board for the books on ancient and mediaeval India. Why should he have any reservations now when he is not associated?â€™â€™

Accusing Narayanan of â€˜â€˜mixing up his factsâ€™â€™, Rajput said it was not true that NCERT history textbooks â€˜â€˜give South India short shriftâ€™â€™. Actually, NCERT has yet to publish history books for many of the classes. â€˜â€˜When they appear, Narayanan will be surprised to see South India has been covered with greater width and depth than ever before.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜The hastiness shown by a few to rush to newspapers with imagined faults is shocking and unbecoming of scholars,â€™â€™ he added.

He reiterated that the government had not issued any direction to NCERT on writing history textbooks. The council was an autonomnous, professional institution that engaged professionals to write books within the parameters of the 1986 National Policy on Education. Going into specifics pointed out by Narayanan, Rajput said the former had made â€˜â€˜wild chargesâ€™â€™ on some issues, and even wondered whether the media had misquoted him. For instance, the map of the Sangam Age published in Social Sciences textbooks of class VI did mention Gangaikondacholapuram and Thanjavur.

â€œBut this is a well known way of juxtaposing modern cities on maps of the ancient world to give the reader a sense of the geographical location of the vanished town,â€™â€™ Rajput contended.

He also said Narayanan had â€œconfused his chronologyâ€� with regard to the Tamil epics Cilappadikaram and Manimeklai.

6,Two arrested for extortion,"NEW DELHI: The west district police claim to have busted a sleaze racket involving a woman and her male associate who allegedly extorted money from people by threatening to make their sexual escapades public. Both have been arrested.

The police said Shweta Dhingra and Govind Bansal, a science graduate from Delhi University, allegedly demanded money from their victims, and threatened to release the video recordings of the event to their relatives in case they appeared reluctant to pay.

â€˜â€˜Bansal videotaped the private moments between the victim and Dhingra, who is in her early 20s. He owns a garments shop in Pitampura,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (west) Dependra Pathak.

The case came to light when an industrialist lodged a complaint with the police claiming to have received an extortion call for Rs 50 lakh. The caller allegedly threatened to make public a video recording of him with Dhingra in a compromising situation.

Based on the businessmanâ€™s version, the police made Dhingra the main suspect. He told the police that Dhingra had once worked in his company and had called for a job a few weeks back. He alleged that she laced his beer with a sedative and made him accompany her to a hotel in Haryana.

During interrogation, Dhingra confessed to taking the victim to a hotel in Haryana where the video recording was done and later making the extortion calls, said the police.

Her confession to the police, however, will not be admissible as evidence in court. Dhingra works as a journalist with a magazine, said the police. The duo allegedly disclosed that they made Bansalâ€™s friend, a next-door shop owner, their first victim.

The two accused, along with the victim and another girl, had gone to a hotel where they clandestinely filmed the events by fixing a portable camera on the table. Later, the accused allegedly made the victim pay them Rs 23 lakh to evade public embarrassment.

9,Dacoits kidnap college principal in Samastipur,"SAMASTIPUR: Even as the Samastipur police have failed to recover several kidnapped persons, including Sunil Kumar of the Mahamada Devpar village and Gulten Sah and his two minor sons of the Bamaura village, the criminals struck again on Tuesday night and abducted the principal of Sant Kabir College, Ramchandra Rai, 50, from his native village, Purnahi.

Sant Kabir College is an affiliated degree college of L N Mithila University. Reports reaching here said that about 30 dacoits raided Raiâ€™s house at Purnahi late on Tuesday night and assaulted him and his wife Bhagwati Devi, who was elected mukhiya of the Purnahi panchayat in the last panchayat elections. They also looted a motorcycle and other valuables worth over Rs 1 lakh.

While fleeing with the booty, they forcibly took away Rai with them. The reports said that a school teacher, identified as Yugeshwar Rai who resided at Ramchandra Raiâ€™s residence in the village, also received injuries when he was attacked by the dacoits. The dacoits, while retreating, fired several shots in the air to terrorise the villagers. The incident has created tension and panic in the rural areas here.

Even as Samastipur superintendent of police Meghnath Ram is camping at Purnahi to supervise the police operation against the dacoits, the villagers are in an angry mood.

Vimal Paswan, the deputy pramukh of the Warisnagar block, said the law and order situation in the district has deteriorated so much that no one appears safe.

Jiwach Paswan, a member of the district committee of the CPI-ML (Liberation) who belongs to Warisnagar, added that if Ramchandra Rai was not recovered soon, the people would launch an agitation.

Of late, it seems to have become a trend here in the district that the dacoits first commit dacoity and then kidnap someone from the household to realise ransom. The strong gangs of twenty to thirty criminals do not feel satisfied with a booty worth Rs 1 lakh or so.

10,Purnia bandh hits rail services,"PURNIA: Train services on Purnia-Katihar-Jogbani and Purnia-Saharsa rail routes were disrupted on the second and final day of 48-hour bandh, supported by all the political parties to focus on police failure to nab the gangsters who abducted a relative of BJP MLA Pradip Das more than three weeks ago.

All vehicular traffic also came to a grinding halt during the â€œchakka jamâ€� programme, said Satyen Sharat Nair, secretary, Purnia Division Busownersâ€™ Association. For the second consecutive day, the markets and business establishments kept their shutters down. Even banks ceased their operations to express their moral support and solidarity with the strikers, claimed the bandh organisers.

Vijay Kumar Srivastava, a local, said the response to the bandh was total and spontaneous, the like of which has seldom been witnessed in this crime-infested twin city of Purnia and Gulabbagh.

Though the call for 48-hour bandh was given by the merchantsâ€™ committee, all political parties have extended their unqualified support.

Hordes of political workers roamed through the twin city of Purnia and Gulabbagh to ensure total response to the bandh call and also to ward off any possible untoward incident.

At Banmankhi railway station, BJP MLA Devnarain Razak prostrated himself on the railway track to immobilise train movement while at Rautra, between Purnea and Katihar stations, agitated people removed hose-pipes to disrupt train movements, according to railway sources.

Unprecedented success of bandh has yet again underlined peoplesâ€™ eroding confidence in the police administration, said many people here.

An all-party meeting was held in the evening to chalk out next phase of the protracted agitation.

11,"Paswan assails Centre, state govt on corruption","NAWADA: National president of Lok Janashakti Party and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that both the Central and the state governments are promoting corruption.

Paswan addressed a huge gathering at Nawada. He claimed that his commitment for development, whatever cabinet portfolio he held, made him unpopular with the people who had no interest in welfare of common people. Paswan demanded that the right to work, health and education be made fundamental rights.

He said that communal politics as practised by the BJP and the caste politics as practised by the RJD are destroying our social fabric and added that the need of the hour was to unite different sections of society. Justifying his decision to leave the NDA, Paswan said he could sense a feeling of disappointment among the people over the way the NDA government functioned.

Paswan flayed the Rabri government for its criminal neglect of the state. â€œThe Congress has virtually sealed its own fate by supporting the RJD and it is no less responsible for the plight of Bihar,â€� Paswan said. He advised the Congress workers to wake up in time and join anti-Laloo forces in the state.

He also said that Biharâ€™s image has taken a severe beating during the Laloo-Rabri regime. Paswan said he had joined NDA hoping to uproot the RJD government in Bihar, but, to his dismay, he found the NDA leaders giving patronage to the corrupt. â€œTheir slogan to remove fear, hunger and corruption from the society remained only a propaganda,â€� he said. He charged the Central government with spreading hatred among the Hindus and the Muslims only to remain in power. He came down heavily on the rail ministry for neglecting the passenger welfare and safety. â€œThe Rajdhani Express mishap near Rafiganj was a result of the carelessness of the railway authorities,â€� the former railway ministersaid. He also criticised the Central government for failing to check atrocities on Dalits.

â€œIn Jhajhar (Haryana), five innocent Dalits were murdered and then were charged with selling cows skins,â€� the former minister lamented. Paswan announced to observe Anti-Dalit Atrocities Day on October 28 throughout the country.

12,Field officers of govt depts a confused lot,"HYDERABAD: Field officers of various departments are in a state of confusion. While it is mandatory for employees to make field visits to inspect factories and establishments, field officials of the departments of industries, labour, employment and training and factories and boilers are, on the contrary, restricted from carrying out such tasks by the government.

As part of efforts to simplify procedures to promote industry in the state, the government has extended self-certification facility to industrial establishments.

This has reduced dependence on field-level inspections by officials about which there were numerous complaints from the industry.

However, senior officials complain that the government continues to evaluate the performance of the field staff for giving increments and promotions based on inspections. ""There is a lot of confusion over the issue as the government orders are self-contradictory,"" a senior bureaucrat said.

13,J&K Governor hopeful of early formation of govt,"NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir Governor Girish Chandra Saxena is hopeful that a popular government would be quickly formed in the state, even as the two key players - Congress and PDP - are set to hold crucial talks on Friday to break the deadlock on government formation.

PDP chief Mufti Mohammed Sayeed is to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi in what is described as make or break talks to resolve their differences, especially on the sticky issue of chief ministership.

Ahead of the talks, Saxena said that in Srinagar it would be good for the state to have a popular government as soon as possible. ""I am hopeful that a government would be formed quickly,"" Saxena told a TV channel.

Congress and PDP, with 20 and 16 seats, respectively, are eight short of the half way mark but they face no hurdles in forming a coalition because of support of the seven-member Democratic People''s Forum (DPF).

Both the parties will put their proposals on the table to resolve the issue of chief ministership, which is the major stumbling block in their coming together.

One proposal includes the two parties sharing the chief ministership for a three-year term each, but here too there are sharp differences over who will assume the reins for the first three years.

The talks are talking place after Gandhi decided on Tuesday to give ""one more attempt"" to reopen the floundering dialogue after PDP vice-president Mehbooba Mufti telephonically pressed for more negotiations.

Saxena also said that he would have to consider appointment of his advisers if there was delay in formation of a government.

""At some stage, I will have to take a decision on appointment of advisers if there is a delay (in government formation),"" he said.

The Governor has not appointed any advisers so far in the hope that a popular government would be formed soon. To a question, Saxena said that the state administration would spare no efforts in combating militancy in the state.

Head of the seven-member DPF, M Y Tarigami of the CPM, said that the mandate of the people in Jammu and Kashmir was for a coalition government and was optimistic that Congress and PDP would hammer out a solution.

Tarigami, whose group is a key player, is currently holding talks with Congress leaders on a Common Minimum Programme.

""The bank proposes to go to the market shortly for raising additional Tier-II capital of Rs 100 crore with a green shoe option of another Rs 50 crore,"" UCO Bank Chief Officer (New Business) A K Maitra said.

Last year too, UCO had raised about Rs 150 crore through Tier-II capital.

He said the bank was also planning to make its maiden IPO in 2003-04. The exact size and timing would be determined in due course.

Maitra said UCO has drawn up an ambitious Technology Road Map for the next few years and has allocated a budget of Rs 200 crore for making itself technology savvy. ""We plan to install 50 ATMs by January, 2003.""

Meanwhile, the Bank on Friday announced it has registered a growth of 38 per cent in operating profit to Rs 272 crore during the first half of its diamond jubilee year over Rs 197 crore in the corresponding period last year.

Net profit during the first half ended September 2002 increased by 17 per cent to Rs 159 crore from Rs 136 crore last year.

He said the growth in profit was made despite making payment of the final instalment of more than Rs 40 crore towards wage arrears, which was scheduled to be paid after October, 2002.

15,Farooq to shift to national politics,"NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Friday indicated that he would like to shift to national politics saying it was time for him to come to the ""larger screen"" of the country.

""I think I should not confine myself to the state and come to the larger screen. All of us have to strengthen India and only then Jammu and Kashmir can become strong. I am now thinking in that direction,"" said Abdullah, who was in the capital to address the NDA rally.

Admitting that he had committed a ""mistake"" by proposing his retirement from politics, Abdullah said ""I think I made a mistake.""

""Omar Abdullah is National Conference (NC) president. He has to strengthen the party, state and fight terrorism. He is young and can do it. I think at this stage I should come to Delhi,"" the former NC president said adding the party would take a decision in this regard.

Asked if he was also looking for a berth in the Centre, Abdullah said that he would decide, if and when any proposal was made to him by the Union government.

Pointing out that he was never opposed to a dialogue between India and Pakistan, Abdullah, however, reiterated that terrorism should stop before any such initiative was under taken.

16,Tarigami regrets delay in J&K govt formation,"NEW DELHI: Regretting that the issue of chief ministership had delayed government formation in Jammu and Kashmir, Democratic People''s Forum (DPF) on Friday said that the people had given a mandate for a ""coalition for good and transparent governance"" of the militancy-torn state and ""not for Governor''s rule"".

M Y Tarigami, leader of DPF which has seven MLAs, also emphasised that small groups be consulted while framing the Common Minimum Programme (CMP), which should meet the aspirations of the people.

""There is a historic opportunity before us and we should not let it go waste,"" the veteran CPM leader told reporters here.

Regretting that ""uncertainty has unnecessarily been created over the government formation which is not good for the troubled state,"" he said ""it is unfortunate that a non-issue like who will become chief minister has come up.""

Tarigami, who is meeting top Congress leadership here, said that all-out efforts should be made to iron out differences to help install a government at the earliest.

""Congress and PDP must move responsibly,"" he said, adding the main thrust should be on providing good governance by a ""transparent government which is accountable to the people.""

""Good governance will be a big step towards resolution of the vexed problem,"" he said, adding ""it is not easy as there are a lot of vested interests around.""

Disapproving arguments that the chief minister should be from Jammu or Kashmir, he said ""anybody belonging to the state can head the government.""

On the issue of rotational chief ministership, he said ""there are roadblocks and if these can be removed by evolving such a formula, then there can be no objection to it"".

Asked whether the DPF would join government, the CPM leader said that this issue could be decided later. ""We want a government in place first"".

To another question whether there was fear among the DPF about their non-inclusion in the government, Tarigami said ""there is no fear of being kept out (of government). Most of the fear is that of uncertainty.""

Delving on the CMP, Tarigami said that it should include a mechanism to ""discipline"" the law enforcing agencies, tackle the ""big problem"" of unemployment and ensure preservation of civil rights of the people.

He also advocated devolution of powers to the three regions of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh to alleviate the feeling of disillusionment there as the issue of more powers to the state could ""not be wished away"".

""Autonomy is not National Conference''s agenda. It reflects the aspirations of the people,"" Tarigami said. ""Those who do not want to agree with us within the limits of democracy, should be allowed to have their say,"" he added.

20,Minimum floor level wage increased by Rs 5,"NEW DELHI: The minimum floor level wage has been increased by Rs five at the national level to Rs 50 per day with effect from September 1, 2002.

Labour Minister Sahib Singh Verma has written to all state governments to ensure that no worker was paid less than Rs 50 per day as the minimum wage in scheduled employments, official sources said here on Friday.

Sources said the national floor level minimum wage of Rs 35 was fixed in 1996 on the recommendations of the National Commission on Rural Labour.

It was increased to Rs 40 in August 1998 in scheduled employments and subsequently raised to Rs 45 in November 1999.

The number of scheduled employments in the Central government is 45 whereas in the state sphere the number is 1,232, the sources said.

Under the Minimum Wages Act, the appropriate governments are required to revise the minimum wages in all scheduled employments under their respective jurisdiction at an interval not exceeding five years.

In order to protect the minimum wages against inflation, the concept of linking it to the rise in the consumer price index was recommended at the labour ministers'' conference in 1988.

Since then the concept of Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA) linked to consumer price index has been floated. The VDA is revised twice a year in April and October.

While the Centre has already made provision in respect of all scheduled employments in the central sphere, 22 states and Union Territories have adopted VDA as a component of minimum wage.

The minimum wages for unskilled workers in the central sphere vary from Rs 54.27 to Rs 129.93 (including VDA) and for agricultural workers from Rs 86.63 to Rs 129.93 per day. In case of different states and Union Territories, it varies from Rs 19.25 to Rs 165.78 (including VDA) and for agricultural workers from Rs 19.25 to Rs 102.

In the absence of any criteria stipulated for fixing the minimum wage in the Minimum Wages Act, the Indian Labour Conference in 1957 had said that the following norms should be taken into account while fixing the minimum wage.

The norms are - three consumption units per earner, minimum food requirement of 2700 calories per average Indian adult, cloth requirement of 72 yards per annum per family, rent corresponding to the minimum area provided under the government''s Industrial Housing Scheme and fuel, lighting and other miscellaneous items of expenditure to constitute 20 per cent of the total minimum wage.

The Supreme Court in a historic judgement in 1992 said that children''s education, medical requirement, minimum recreation, including festivals, ceremonies, provision for old age and marriage should further constitute 25 per cent and be used as a guide for fixing the minimum wage.

21,Inter-ministerial panel to oversee FDI in print media,"NEW DELHI: An inter-ministerial committee is proposed to be set up to examine the nature and categorisation of non-news and non-current affairs publications applying for foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country.

This is being done to ensure proper classification of the publications particularly since the government has allowed 74 per cent FDI in the sector and only 26 per cent in news and current affairs in print media, information and broadcasting ministry sources said.

It is proposed that the committee, to be chaired by joint information and broadcasting, secretary, would have representatives from the home and finance ministries, media and specialists.

An undertaking will also be taken from the publisher that the nature of the magazine will not be changed and any violation of this will be viewed seriously by the government, the sources said.

The approval will be given to publications and not to a group, since the FDI quantum varies in news and current affairs and other publications.

The proposals of the inter-ministerial meeting to discuss the FDI guidelines for the non-news print media, which includes medical and technical journals, are likely to be cleared by the government soon, they said.

The ministry is hopeful of putting in place the FDI guidelines for news and non-news print media before the winter session of Parliament.

The sources said purely skilled magazines will be easier to give approval while ""grey"" areas like political journals would have to be examined.

They said in case of a publishing house wanting to bring out an Indian edition of a non-news, non-current affairs publication, approval would be granted directly.

However, if a foreign institutional investor (FII) is picking up stake in an Indian venture for such a publication to fund its Indian edition, such applications would be given a no objection certificate (NOC) and sent to RBI for clearance.

In the third scenario, if a known foreign partner wants to bring in FDI, such cases will get an NOC and then be referred to Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).

22,Status report shows 'proof' of govt work,"BANGALORE: Public Record of Operations and Finance (PROOF), a campaign launched to put in place a systematic structure of government performance reporting along the lines of the private sector has come out with a status report of its activities.

The focus of the 10-month campaign is about the BCC building confidence with various stakeholders with full and accurate performance.

According to the status report released by the PROOF partners __ Centre for Budget and Policy Studies, Ashish Sen of Voices, Suresh Balakrishnan of Public Affairs Centre and Ramesh Ramanathan of Janaagraha __ the team has been working on four different facets.

Addressing a joint press conference on Friday after releasing the report, the members said the campaign focussed on the analysis of BCC''s first quarter financial statements, helped the organisation in developing performance indicators for various activities and organised comprehensive training for its officials on understanding financial statements.

During the analysis of financial statements, the following points were brought to light:

* The actual cash position of BCC at the end of the first quarter was not provided. However, given the opening balance and the fund usage, a sum of Rs 93 crore has to be netted in various bank accounts as on June end.

* The revenue for the first quarter is Rs 191 crore and the full year projection is Rs 948 crore. Given that, 50 per cent of the year''s property tax has already been collected which implies a fairly large shortfall in revenues for the full year.

* Assuming that 25 per cent of the total budgeted amount could be collected in the first quarter, most revenues and expenditures fall short.

* Property tax collection so far is Rs 82 crore and will be Rs 165 crore for the entire year. This will result in a shortfall of Rs 28 crore.

Meanwhile, performance indicators were developed for the education and health departments and the team is working on collecting its data. An integral part of the PROOF campaign involves training of the stake holders which has developed training documents on basics of budgeting and financial statements.

The second public debate of the campaign is slated for November.

Ramesh also added that the southern chapter of CII has also approached PROOF to help them with specific activities which includes organising middle level workshops and seminars.

24,SGPC polls: Tohra tries to dent Badal camp,"CHANDIGARH: Will the third front, which is believed to be enjoying the tacit support of former SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra, dent the Badal camp in the ensuing SGPC executive elections?

The front, spearheaded by a sevenmember committee including Mal Singh Ghuman, a former close confidante of Parkash Singh Badal, is considered to be Tohraâ€™s ploy to break into the Badal camp in the name of depoliticising the SGPC elections.

The committee members have been campaigning to evolve unanimity around a consensus, apolitical candidate who would provide religious leadership to the Sikh parliament.

After meeting president of the Akali Dal (Amritsar) Simranjit Singh Mann, the committee held a meeting with Surjit Kaur, wife of Uttaranchal governor Surjit Singh Barnala, here, on Friday.

Kaur lauded the effort of the committee but did not commit her or Barnalaâ€™s support to it.

Incidentally, Tohra also called on Kaur later in the day in an attempt to wean away Barnala from the Badal camp. Hardeep Singh Mohali, spokesperson of the committee, said the committee members would also formally call on Tohra and senior Akali leader Kuldip Singh Wadala to elicit their support for their cause. Even as Badal has dismissed the third front as non-entity and ridiculed its contention of putting up an apolitical candidate for the post of the SGPC president, Hardeep said the committee would also call on the former chief minister in order to persuade him to change his mind.

With nearly 100 SGPC members associated with the Badal camp having gone into hiding, it is not certain what success the third front committee would achieve in muster support for itself. It is largely harping on the support of the Tohra camp which enjoys support of about 52 members. As in the last yearâ€™s election, the Tohra groupâ€™s presidential candidate, Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, could garner the backing of 56 members, the committee members expect the number to go up this time with some of the Badal supporters also joining them. However, indications are that the committee might not make much headway in its efforts.

The committee has invited all senior leaders including Badal, Tohra and Mann, to a meeting at the Akal Takht on November 1 to decide on the presidential candidate.While the committee members have declined to be in race for the post, Bhaur, Tohra and Sant Mitha Singh are among the names being talked about as possible candidates for it.

Speculation is rife in the Badal camp that sitting SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar might not get a second term. Among other names that have been doing the rounds are those of Jagir Kaur, Mahinder Singh Rumana and Kiranjot Kaur.

25,Mulayam peps up partymen,"LUCKNOW: Asserting that the Uttar Pradesh government had been reduced to a minority, Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on Thursday asked his party to strike the iron while it was hot. He exhorted them to throw the present coalition out of power, while directing them to end groupism.

In an impromptu address near the main gate of the party office, Yadav asked the partymen to realise their strength as a group. He said the common manâ€™s faith in the government had ended and they wanted a change.

He, however, maintained that he was not for mid-term elections in the state.

He alleged that both Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani wanted the coalition government in UP to continue as they were eying parliamentary elections.

He lashed out at chief minister Mayawati for emptying the state exchequer on projects like the Ambedkar Park, which did not benefit the poor and downtrodden in any way. So many schools and hospitals could have been constructed with that money, he said. Extolling party workers for observing Thu Thu Diwas in retaliation to the Bahujan Samaj Partyâ€™s (BSP) Dhikkar Rally, Yadav said Mayawati did not even have the guts to visit those injured in the stampede at the Charbagh railway station in Lucknow. She visited them after three days, he added.

Earlier, addressing the district and city presidents and heads of various cells, Yadav said they were an important link and should work towards strengthening the party.

Cautioning the partymen against indiscipline, Mulayam said every worker had a right to air his view but once a decision was taken by the party, all members had to adhere to it.

26,Salman case: Lawyers say law should be equal for all,"MUMBAI: Lawyers note that in fatal hit-and-run cases, the police usually do not apply their minds to see whether an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder is made out. So, why was a distinction made in actor Salman Khan's case? On September 28, the actor had, in an allegedly inebriated state, rammed his Land Cruiser into a shop at Hill Road, Bandra, killing one person and injuring four others.The Bandra police investigating the case initially charged him with causing death due to rash and negligent driving. But as pressure began to be plied from the top, the police went into overdrive. They came up with the more serious charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The offence supposes that the accused has knowledge that the act committed could cause death. The offence, being nonbailable, also meant that in order for the actor to be released, a court would have had to be satisfied that he was not going to abscond or tamper with evidence. Admittedly, there is a growing perception that the laws dealing with road accidents need to be stringent. The supreme court, in a 2000 verdict, had said, When automobiles have become death traps any leniency shown to drivers who are found guilty of rash driving would be at the risk of further escalation of road accidents..One of the most effective ways of keeping such drivers under mental vigil is to maintain a deterrent in the sentencing sphere.'' Lawyers say the law should be equal for all. The police must seriously look into the circumstances of each fatal hitand-run case to find out whether 304 (ii) is applicable,'' criminal counsel P.R. Vakil says.He adds, A separate provision needs to be incorporated in law to check fatal accidents.'' But advocate Shrikant Bhat says the focus needs to be more on the investigation and not so much on changes in law. He says that there is scarcely any case in which the police has come to the conclusion that the pedestrian or victim has been at fault or is guilty of contributory negligence. There are many cases where the driver is not at fault, yet routinely the police book only the drivers,'' he adds. The trials are often delayed because of false panchanamas, he contends. In one 1980 case handled by the Bandra police in which the police themselves were witness and complainant, it took 16 years for the case to be disposed of. The case eventually ended in acquittal. The victim's son, Anandji Joshi, was awarded compensation of merely Rs 1 lakh, which he has still not received as the accused has gone in appeal. Regarding compensation, lawyers admit that a claims case before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal typically takes up to ten years before decision is given.Tribunal officials say there are currently cases pending from 1989 onwards. On Thursday, 1981 case was finally disposed of. to April 2002, 17,153 claims cases were disposed of from the 24,039 placed before the lok adalats from 1990. A senior tribunal official said that delays in disposal are often caused indifferent lawyers. The lawyers disagree. They point to the inadequate number of courts and poor infrastructure. The victims are the worst sufferers. Often, even the Rs 50,000 interim compensation for death victims is not submitted within the stipulated months. Many in legal circles say that the high court order in the Salman case could trigger a plethora of petitions seeking interim compensation. As Mr Jethmalani says, The HC order is very good order, but I hope the court kept in mind that there are thousands of drunken driving cases resulting deaths and in many such cases, the trial has not even begun.''
