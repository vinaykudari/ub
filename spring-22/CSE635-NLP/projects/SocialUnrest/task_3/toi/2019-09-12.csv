0,Making nonsense of molestation rules,"PUNE: Most colleges and educational institutions in the city have sidetracked the University Grants Commission (UGC) rules and supreme court directives of setting up gender sensitisation committees against sexual harassment.While the issue has gained prominence after increasing cases of sexual harassment, the more recent being the rape of a first year law student from a city college, most colleges said they don't feel the need to establish a separate cell as per the UGC guidelines. Modern College of Arts and Science principal A.G. Gosavi felt there was no need to establish such a cell.We, instead, have a counselling cell where senior faculty members from the psychology department are invited to give lessons on sex education to the students, he said, adding that the students can also approach the senior members of the faculty in case of sexual harassment. The apex court in 1997 made it mandatory for all colleges affiliated to universities to set up college-level committees to screen complaints of sexual harassment and then follow up the cases found to be prima facie genuine.The UGC followed suit with a directive in 1997 that the universities need to set up a sexual harassment cell whereas the colleges can form a committee, mostly headed by female members, to look into any such grievances. While the university of Pune established a cell in July 10, 2001, Bharati Vidyapeeth (deemed university) registrar B.R. Arbad said all its affiliated colleges have already formed such committees. The Symbiosis International Education Centre has a sexual harassment cell, but only to look into the grievances of its staff members.The well-known institute does not have a specific cell to deal with sexual harassment or complaints of eveteasing faced by students, Symbiosis Law College principal Mrinal Raste said. He, however, added that complaints of sexual harassment by students could be referred to the human rights violation cell. Preeti Karmarkar from the Nari Samata Mancha said although she has been trying to sensitise the educational institutions in the city on the issue, establishing a women's cell for colleges is not on the priority list of most colleges. We convened a meeting of college principals in March this year to convince them to set up committees to look into increasing cases of sexual harassment, but the response was very poor, she said.Students who spoke to TNN were divided on the issue. A student from the Symbiosis institute said there was an urgent need to establish a different forum so that the victims could confide easily. Registering a complaint with the principal or any other senior authority is not always possible, she said. Another student from Fergusson college said there was no need to have such a cell, as the victims could directly approach the principal or the vice-principal.Principal of Sir Parshurambhau College, C.R. Aragade, admitted that the institute doesn't have a cell to look into cases of sexual abuses faced by students or faculty. However, efforts are on to have a cell by the month-end, he said. Fergusson College principal Vasant Wagh, when contacted, was unaware of any such directive from the UGC.

1,UGC scoffs at teachers’ protests over new workload norms,"NEW DELHI: Even as Delhi University teachers cry themselves hoarse over their demands, the University Grants Commission (UGC) said their protest did not make sense. The new workload norms had been implemented across the country and Delhi University (DU) could not be an exception.

The DU Teachersâ€™ Association (DUTA) strike will cost the government over Rs 6 crore a week in terms of teaching hours, UGC secretary C P Srivastava said. ""It seems the modern day Dronacharyas are bent on extracting the guru-dakshina by playing havoc with studies,"" he said.

On Wednesday, more than 1,500 teachers gathered outside the UGC office and shouted slogans as part of their week-long strike. They also presented a memorandum to commission officials. Srivastava said the pay package issued by the UGC in 1998 was meant to be followed by universities and colleges all over the country as a composite scheme. ""It is ironic that the teachers have accepted the salary recommendations, but are striking against other recommendations which include an increase in teaching hours,"" he said.

Moreover, the notifications are no longer the UGCâ€™s baby. ""The orders have come from the top. It is a government matter where the ministry of finance and human resource development (HRD) are involved,"" he added.

The teachers are protesting against the increase in workload suggested by the UGC. DU teachers teach for 15 hours (18 periods) a week. This includes theory classes and tutorials or practicals. The UGC wants them to teach for 22 hours a week. The teachers voice a similar accusation. ""Promotion from reader to professor in colleges was also part of the package, but this was withdrawn without rationale,"" DUTA president Shaswati Mazumdar said.

UGC and DU have exchanged a torrent of letters over this matter. In March, when UGCâ€™s latest letter was reported in the academic council, the vice-chancellor constituted a committee to examine the issue. Another issue is the filling of vacant posts. UGC clarified it had permitted colleges to fill 80 per cent of their vacant teaching posts.

DU is the only varsity where colleges are paid by UGC. In other states, the UGC passes on the grant and the notification to the state for implementation. Recently, a recommendation of the expenditure reforms commission of the ministry of HRD raised a storm in DU. It suggested a separate grant disbursing body be formed under state government.

Rebutting the teachersâ€™ claim that the 40-hour structure proposed by the UGC was academically unsound, Srivastava said all decisions related to academics were taken by specially constituted committees of experts invited from all over the country. As for the ratio of theory to tutorials/practicals, the UGC questioned why this complaint was not coming in from other parts of the country.

2,Cases against perpetrators of Gujarat riots soon,"LUCKNOW: Individual members of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) would soon file criminal suits against perpetrators of Gujarat riots, according to Maulana Rabe Hasan Nadvi, AIMPLB president and rector of internationally-known Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulema.

Talking to Times News Network on Wednesday, Maulana Rabe, who has grown under the towering personality of Maulana Ali Mian and whose shoes he eventually stepped into both at Nadwa and AIMPLB, said: â€œThe board will not lend its name to the suits but all possible help will be provided to the members. All the legal aspects of the cases are being worked out.â€�

Asked about the recent provocative speeches of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi against minorities, particularly Muslims, during his â€˜gaurav yatraâ€™ for which he was admonished by BJP president Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday, Maulana Rabe said: â€œWe donâ€™t want to put everything on record but the board is taking cognizance of Modiâ€™s diatribe. Since our Hindu brethren are already criticising Modi and others responsible for the Gujarat riots, we donâ€™t want to engage in a verbal duel with him.â€�

â€œThis is, perhaps, for the first time that Hindus have come out so openly in favour of Muslims,â€� Maulana Rabe added. When his attention was drawn towards September 28 Sant Sammelan in Lucknow for chalking out future course of action in connection with the construction of Ram temple and the UP governmentâ€™s delaying tactics in not issuing a notification, Maulana Rabe said: â€œWe will wait for the courtâ€™s verdict. This is a very democratic and reasonable way to solve this problem.â€�

The Maulana agreed that Muslims needed a united platform but refused to form a political wing of AIMPLB, like the one it had created to look after the Babri Masjid dispute.

â€œThe basic aim of the board is to deal with the problems of shariat. We donâ€™t want to come in the open nor we intend to appeal for formation of any political party. But, yes, the need of the hour is unity. All-India Milli Council and Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawirat are active in this field and the board is providing them all help.â€� When it was pointed out that the two bodies lacked following among Muslims, the Maulana said: â€œIf they do sincere work their acceptability will increase.â€�

The Maulana termed the talk of common civil code as an infringement on Muslimsâ€™ rights guaranteed in the Constitution. â€œThere are so many codes in India that a common civil code is virtually impossible. We wonâ€™t mind if they make a common code for Hindus but we will oppose one for Muslims with all our means.â€�

On triple talaq, the Maulana said: â€œIn the first place, Islam preaches harmonious relations between husband and wife. But if the relations between the two reach the point of no return, Islam also gives the freedom to the warring partners to opt for a talaq. Normally, one month is given between the three talaqs. But if the husband and wife so decide then triple talaq can be given at one go.â€� When his attention was drawn that this provision could be misused by some unscrupulous men, Maulana Rabe said: â€œExceptions are always thereâ€�.

Maulana Rabe, an Arabic scholar, who has just returned from Egypt where he had gone to attend Universal League of Islamic Literature conference, said: â€œThe USAâ€™s animosity towards Muslims after the WTC attack has antagonised the entire Muslim world, particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the two most-trusted US allies in the Arab world. America is losing its friends.â€�

3,"Chopper used for minister, not victims","KOLKATA: â€˜â€˜The lives of many passengers of the Rajdhani Express could have been saved if choppers were pressed into action to airlift them to better hospitals.

You cannot expect better evacuation if the divisional railway manager reaches the spot after four hours,â€™â€™ said a bitter general secretary of the Indian Railways Promotee Officers Association K Hasan on Wednesday.

He was at the Howrah station to receive the bodies of the staff who were on duty in the ill-fated train. Planes and helicopters were used on Tuesday to fly in and out the railway minister and the chairman of the Railway Board.

It is now being asked why the same were not used to ferry critically injured passengers to better equipped hospitals.

4,Omar promises anti-corruption law,"POONCH: National Conference (NC) president Omar Abdullah has promised to bring in a new legislation on corruption if he becomes the chief minister. He said the Centre has failed to pass the Lok Pal Bill because the politicians donâ€™t want to be made accountable for their misdeeds.

However, this would not happen in Jammu and Kashmir because all politicians would be brought under the ambit of the proposed new anti-corruption law, he added.

In an exclusive interview to the Times News Network after an election rally here, Omar said he was aware that corruption has sullied the NCâ€™s image during the last six years. While all corruption charges levelled against the NC functionaries canâ€™t be taken as gospel truth, some of them may be worth examining, he said. Omar said he was committed to strengthening the vigilance department of the state government which investigates corruption cases. He promised that cases of corruption against officials and politicians would be investigated and the guilty punished. The ruling NCâ€™s designated chief ministerial candidate said autonomy was not the only plank on which his party was seeking votes.

Important issues like all round development of different regions and sub-regions, besides equipping schools with modern gadgets and improving the educational standards also formed a part of hispartyâ€™s agenda.

He said he did not believe the Jammu region has been discriminated against but the issues pertaining to the development of backward areas need to be looked at from a different perspective.

Asked how did I feel to be on the threshold of becoming the youngest CM, he said: â€˜â€˜No, I donâ€™t think I am at the threshold yet. I canâ€™t take the voters for granted. The voters have a right to approve or disapprove of my party and my candidates. This is what democracy is all about and that is why I am here campaigning for my candidate.â€™â€™

He said the condition of block development councils and district level panchayat bodies was very much on the party agenda. This would be done in due course of time, he said in reply to a question as to why panchayats have not been given powers a year after holding their elections.

5,Tiwari rules out sabotage,"PATNA: The Rashtriya Janata Dal has criticised railway minister Nitish Kumar for attributing the derailment of Rajdhani Express to sabotage.

RJD spokesman and excise minister Shivanand Tiwari speaking at a press conference here on Wednesday claimed the railway authorities concerned had planted an â€œunusedâ€� rail track near the accident site soon after the incident to prove the â€œsabotage theoryâ€�.

â€œIn a distance of one km, about 1,600 railway sleepers are used. If Nitishâ€™s theory is right, it means 20 sleepers were removed within 40 minutes and that too after cutting the iron. Moreover, the weight of one meter railway line is said to be 52 kg, he informed. It is not possible for saboteurs to remove railway lines weighing more than 700 kg in a such a short time,â€� Tiwari maintained while ridiculing Nitishâ€™s â€œsabotage theoryâ€�.

He believed it was the report submitted by the Central IB which prompted the home minister to admit the incident was an â€œaccidentâ€�.

He also demanded a thorough probe into the accident besides immediate resignation of Nitish and railway board chairman IIMS Rana for making â€œirresponsibleâ€� statements about the derailment of the Rajdhani Express. He urged Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to immediately dismiss them for creating confusion among the people without waiting for the findings of the probe. â€œIn fact, the railway safety is under the home ministry and they will make an inquiry into the incident. The railway ministry has no role in it,â€� he pointed out.

6,We had alerted govt on sabotage threat: Police,"PATNA: Senior Bihar officials were busy looking for face saving ways on Wednesday as it came to light that the Special Branch of police had only a few days back sounded alert that the extremist outfit, Maoist Communist Centre, would attempt to derail trains in Aurangabad district to settle scores with the railways.

The state government had on Tuesday claimed that the derailment of Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express at Dhawa bridge in Rafiganj of Aurangabad district was caused due to poor maintenance of the bridge. The Special Branch alert negates this claim and lends credence to the claim that the mishap was a result of sabotage by extremist groups.

Sources said that the CMâ€™s secretariat has sought information from the state intelligence agency about the veracity of the intelligence report. The police headquarters was busy on Wednesday â€œretrievingâ€� files containing the â€˜intelligence alertâ€™.

The Special Branch, according to informed sources, had signalled the alert following information that the MCC men were nursing a grudge against the railway authorities for their refusal to pay levy as demanded by the former. It was because of this that the MCC set ablaze a Tata Sumo vehicle of the railways about 10 days back. Sources said that the MCC also used to threaten railway authorities for their refusal to pay cut money in the ongoing railway schemes in the area.It was perhaps in this light that the Special Branch issued a â€˜specific alertâ€™ that the MCC may inflict damage to railway properties.

However, a senior police official reiterated the earlier stand that the poor maintenance of the railway bridge was responsible for the train disaster. He said that the state government had issued alert only twice in the past indicating that the extremists would damage railway properties.

The first such alert was issued about a year back when capital punishment was awarded to nine MCC men for their involvement in Bara carnage. Enraged over the judgment, the MCC had decided to â€˜teach a lessonâ€™ if the death sentence against their cadres was not withdrawn. The Special Branch had then issued an alert that the MCC would damage railway and road and government properties.

The second time such an alert, specifically mentioning the possibility of damage to railway property by extremists, was issued during the Jharkhand bandh.

Though Jharkhand bandh had nothing to do with Bihar, the latter had sounded alert in all districts bordering Jharkhand, the Bihar police official said.

7,Govt rules out release of water to KC canal,"HYDERABAD: Even as the distress among the farming community in Rayalaseema region is continuing, the state government has ruled out release of water to KC canal and Rajolibanda diversion scheme projects under the Tungabhadra river to serve the irrigation needs of the farmers dependent on the projects.

The government has also ruled out release of water to Tungabhadra dam from the Srisailam reservoir as the water levels in Srisailam project were already precariously low.

The government''s decision comes in the light of the agitations launched by farmers as well as public representatives of Rayalaseema region, those hailing from Kurnool and Cuddapah districts in particular, over the past few days for release of water into KC canal through the Srisailam project to cater to their irrigation needs.

""The water from the Srisailam reservoir can only supplement the requirement of KC canal and there is no chance of releasing water to KC canal given the present low levels of water in the reservoir. Unaware of the ground realities, the farmers have started the agitation,"" major irrigation minister Kadiam Srihari said, appealing to farmers to restrain from taking to agitations.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the minister said that though water from Srisailam was being released to Nagarjunasagar at present, even that would not be possible in the near future due to the insufficient in-flows from the catchment areas.

""With the failure of the monsoon, transplantation took place only in 13 lakh hectares as against the 26 lakh hectares under the normal conditions, it will be difficult to release water to the two projects under the Tungabhadra river,"" he said.

8,Oppn raps CM for retaining tainted ministers,"HYDERABAD: The minor cabinet reshuffle effected by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday failed to convince the opposition about governmentâ€™s intention to check corruption at high places.

The changes in the council of ministers evoked strong criticism from the opposition parties. Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president M Satyanarayana Rao said that though the cabinet reshuffle was a routine exercise and the prerogative of the chief minister, it showed that the government was bent on continuing with tainted ministers in the cabinet.

â€œWhile the chief minister sought the resignation of P Srinivas Reddy on ethical grounds, he did not adopt the same yardstick in the case of other ministers like Kodela Sivaprasada Rao, K E Prabhakar, Nagam Janardhan Reddy and K Subbarayudu, whose names also figured in the incidents of irregularities.â€� He demanded that Naidu seek the resignations of other ministers whose names figure in the scandals.

Meanwhile, the CPM state committee said that the cabinet reshuffle would not help in removing corruption from the government nor would it enhance the administrative efficiency of the government. CPM secretary BV Raghavulu, in a press release on Wednesday, said that the continuation of energy minister K Subbarayadu and minor irrigation minister K E Prabhakar in the cabinet shows the insincerity of Naidu in cleansing corruption from the administration.

9,New health minister inspects city hospitals,"HYDERABAD: Soon after taking oath, the new health minister Dr K Siva Prasada Rao made a surprise visit to Niloufer Hospital and Osmania General Hospital on Wednesday.

Siva Prasad Rao spent about 40-minutes at Niloufer hospital where he met the nurses, doctors and patients at the OPD, radiology and general wards. The minister noticed that there was a shortfall of staff nurses in the hospital even though the sanctioned strength was available and instructed the health director and regional director, Hyderabad, to depute more staff nurses in the hospital from where ever there was excess staff. The minister also told the doctors as well as the staff to be kind and good to the patients as a number of economically backward patients come for treatment at the Niloufer hospital.

Later, Siva Prasada Rao visited the Osmania General Hospital where he inspected SICU, casualty, burns and the orthopaedic units. In the SICU, except for the probationer staff nurse, the minister found no one else to brief him about the activities of the unit. A 60-year-old patient complained to the minister that he had come to the hospital four days ago and he was not given proper treatment by the doctors. The man was suffering from gangrene. The minister told the duty doctor to immediately attend to the patient. He also observed IV fluids were given to almost all patients and instructed the staff to give the fluids only when necessary.

10,"VSNL sub-commitee meets, no decision yet on Tata investment","NEW DELHI: The sub-commitee of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd board, formed to review its decision to invest Rs 1,200 crore in a Tata Group company, on Wednesday met here, but failed to take any concrete decision on the investment plan.

The sub-committee, which includes VSNL Managing Director S K Gupta, was constituted following a tussle between Tatas and the government - the two partners in VSNL, over the corporation''s decision to invest Rs 1,200 crore in loss-making Tata Teleservices.

According to sources, this was just a review meeting as the sub-committee has appointed ICICI Securities to undertake the required valuation exercise of the proposed investment by VSNL into Tata Teleservices. When contacted, Subodh Bhargava, member of the sub-committee, said that no final decision has been taken in Wednesday''s meeting.

Asked about the next meeting, he said it was likely to take place by the end of this month. Earlier, the committee got an extension to submit its report to the VSNL board in two months time from August 15. VSNL Managing Director S K Gupta could not be contacted for his comments.

However, it was not clear as to whether the committee had prepared any interim report for submission before the board, with some officials associated with the sub-committee saying that a status report on the work assigned to it would be presented before the board.

11,3 new ministers inducted in AP Cabinet,"HYDERABAD: What some had predicted would be a major chop-and-change operation ended up being a cosmetic surgery. Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu inducted three ministers into his cabinet and shuffled the portfolios of four.

At the end of the swearing-in of the new ministers on Wednesday morning, he chaired a cabinet meeting where he held out an elaborate list of dos and donâ€™ts for his ministers. While the broad thrust of his thesis was that corruption would not be tolerated, publicly at a press conference he kept a straight face and dismissed charges against his ministers as trumped up.

The day began with a 15-minute swearing-in ceremony at Raj Bhavan, where N Anjaneyulu, P Babu Mohan and C Muthyam Reddy were administered oath of office. All of them are from Telangana. M Damodar Reddy, who was elevated to cabinet rank, too was sworn in afresh. He moves from technical education to transport.

N Janardhan Reddy was shunted out of the health department and given the panchayat raj portfolio. Initially reluctant to accept the new job, he was coaxed into accepting his new assignment. K Sivaprasad Rao takes over from Janardhan Reddy. N Md Farooq has been moved to the higher education department from municipal affairs. A tainted face in the Naidu team, the chief minister is understood to have clipped Farooqâ€™s wings.

Later, at a cabinet meeting, Naidu harangued his team members on how they must cut down on ostentation, set standards in personal conduct, curb corruption and keep family members away from affairs of state. His stern message to the ministers: Mend your ways, or else face the consequences. â€œGod has given us this opportunity. I am giving you another chance to put your act together and perform,â€� he told them.

Each minister, he warned, would be monitored closely and failures wonâ€™t be tolerated. Laying down a 49-point code of conduct, he said: â€œIâ€™ve given you all powers. The financial powers are with you. You are responsible for the performance of your department. Discipline, performance and integrity are the key words. Be proactive, not reactive.â€�

He urged his ministers to blunt the Congress criticism of the government. â€œWe have been pushed on the defensive only because you are not countering them effectively,â€� he said. Later, at a press conference, he smugly defended his ministers, allegedly involved in the Food For Work scandal, saying he would not initiate proceedings against any of them on the basis of allegations that are â€œbaselessâ€�.

And this, from the exhibition and distribution sectors alone.On an average, exhibitors at 150 theatres in and around the city get Rs 10,000 each as rentals, while distributors earn a similar amount, Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) President K.V.

16,Bangalore bandh passes off peacefully,"BANGALORE: The dawn-to-dusk Bangalore Bandh called in protest against the release of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu was a total success and peaceful affair.

Thoroughfares wore deserted look, affecting normal life in the city. Sporadic incidents of stone pelting from areas identified as hyper-sensitive were reported.

The hypersensitive areas are Kamakshi Palya, Basaveshwaranagar, Hebbal, Chord Road, Magadi Road, Vijayanagar, Mysore Road, K.G.Road- all of which had witnessed unprecedented violence during the 1991 Cauvery riots. By clamping prohibitory orders and deploying additional forces including the Rapid Action Force (RAF), the police ensured that the city did not witness any ugly incident.

The police curbed the movement of youths, closed wine shops and petrol pumps in these areas which helped them handle the bandh. Despite this, stone pelting was reported from Shivanahalli, Peenya and Mysore Road.

Groups of Kannada volunteers burnt Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J.Jayalalitha''s effigy in Rajajinagar, Hebbal Ring Road, Jayanagar, Vijayanagar, Banashankari, Chamarajpet, Yeshwanthapur, Mathikere, and Chord Road, near Prasanna theatre on Magadi Road.

Protestors damaged a Toyota Qualis vehicle near Modi Hospital in Basaveshwaranagar. Another group damaged a jeep in Chandra Layout and miscreants tried to set fire to it, but the timely intervention by the police defused the situation.

The Cubbon Park police arrested several leaders of Kananda organisations including Vatal Nagaraj when they tried to block the road leading to Raj Bhavan on Thursday morning. Later, they were released.

KSRTC, BMTC, private buses and autorickshaws stayed away from the road. Shops and establishments including hotels remained closed all over the city. Only medical shops were seen open in several parts of the city. All activity came to a stand still at Russel Market area in Shivajinagar, eateries and poultry joints closed the shop in support of the Bandh.

Both the Central and State government offices remained open, but, the attendance was very poor. This because of closing down of the public transport and police curtailing the movement of vehicles on the roads. High Court and other courts also remained open, but there were hardly any petitioners and advocates, only judges attended the office.

Several banks were closed and miscreants got a bank on R.V.Road to close down by using force. Reserve Bank of India was open and several government departments remitted money.

The city police had made tight security arrangements by deploying one company of RAF, 60 platoons of City Armed Reserve and 24 platoons of KSRP. This apart from 1,000 home guards. Police Commissioner H.T.Sangliana, Joint Commissioner Jeevan Kumar B.Gaonkar and other senior officers were on their toes from early morning on Thursday monitoring security arrangements. At one point of time, some officers felt there was a shortage of troops.

The police had kept a close watch in sensitive areas inhabited by the linguistic minorities. Buses from Tamil Nadu and other areas were stopped on the outskirts and alternate arrangements made to transport public to their destination in the city. This caused hardship to the visitors.

Private schools and colleges had declared a holiday. Essential services, including milk supply and medical services, remained normal.

The protesters did not cause any harm to two-wheeler riders. Over 500 `trouble-makers'' were taken into preventive custody since Wednesday.

``The bandh passed off peacefully because there was no movement of buses and shops remained closed. Partial opening of shops and movement of buses would have aggravated the situation. This is the reason why we advised against movement of buses and schools remaining open on the Bandh day,'''' a senior police officer said.

17,We don't regret toeing religious line for polls: State BJP chief,"RAJKOT: The state Bharatiya Janata Party president Rajendrasinh Rana said that his party does not regret toeing the religious line for the state Assembly elections. ""There is no harm in beginning something with the blessings from religious places, he said.

Rana, however, clarified that though it was beginning the Gaurav Yatra from religious places, it did not mean that the BJP would use religion as an election plank during the ensuing elections.

When asked to comment on a government report about 45 per cent rise in corruption during the last three years, the BJP president said, ""The policies of the government have been formulated in a manner to ensure that corruption is kept to the minimum, but despite this if there is corruption, then it is the fault of the system.""

For a change, the state BJP president did not blame the Congress party for all the evils in the society, instead, Rana extolled the finer points of the Gaurav Yatra, which he claimed to be a big success.

When his attention was drawn to the fact that the national party president Venkaiya Naidu had asked Chief Minister Narendra Modi to be careful about his utterances against the minorities, the state BJP president said, ""There is no harm in putting your ideas before someone.""

Asked to comment on reports about his rapport, or the lack of it, with Narendra Modi, Rana denied any such reports and said that his relations with the chief minister were cordial, adding, ""I mean it"".

Replying to a question about the prime minister''s opposition to the Gaurav Yatra, the state BJP president said, ""The situation was not conducive for the yatra three months ago, as a result the yatra was postponed. Now with the situation changing, the yatra is off to a flying start and it has clearance from the prime minister,"" Rana claimed.

18,VHP cooks up a treat for riot accused,"AHMEDABAD: â€œDal dhokli, ringnabatata nu shak, rotli, bhat, laadva...â€�. No menu for the ongoing Ganesh festivity this, but a sample menu of what rioters accused of unleashing communal violence on the streets of Gujarat are eating behind bars at the Sabarmati central jail here.

The gastronomic responsibility has been assumed by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), which has decided that the infamous jail food is not for those behind bars for rioting! â€œProviding food to the under-trials accused of rioting was decided in the meeting chaired by key VHP leaders, Pravin Togadia and Jaydeep Patel. The under-trials are expected to work very hard in jail which is not possible eating the jail food.

On the other hand, it is cumbersome for family members to send food from home everyday. So, we decided to provide them with home-made nutritious food... this is the least we can do for these poor fellows,â€� VHP secretary of the west zone of Ahmedabad, Ashwin Patel, told TNN.

The food is prepared in a nondescript bungalow in Ranip where a brigade of ten-people, including a professional cook, plan lunch and dinner everyday for over 180 undertrails accused of rioting in the central jail. Once prepared, the food is packed in â€˜dabbasâ€™ with specific names and barrack numbers of the under-trails to ensure that each one receives his share of good food.

During the month of Shravan, specific arrangement was made to send â€˜buf-vadaâ€™, banana wafers and other food items for 60 under-trial rioters who were observing the month of fasting.

When the scheme was initiated on April 10, there were 216 â€˜dabbasâ€™ to be made every morning and evening.

â€œCourt proceedings have begun and many under-trails have been released on bail. The number increases sometimes if there are fresh arrests,â€� said Bhagubhai, in-charge of the meals project. His sincerity towards his job reflects in the fact that not only he personally supervises the cooking of the meals, but also makes it a point to taste everything to avoid any contamination.

Does this project to feed the suspected rioters not indicate that the VHP is openly supporting the perpetrators of violence? â€œMany riot-accused behind bars are workers of the VHP. If they indulged in violence, it was only for the good of society,â€� said Patel.
