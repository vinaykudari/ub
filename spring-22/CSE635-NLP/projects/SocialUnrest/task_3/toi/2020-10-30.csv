0,Punjab ministers deny what they are not even aware of,"CHANDIGARH: Thirteen Punjab ministers have claimed, in a joint but unsigned statement, that there is no dissidence in the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) and that media reports about it are â€˜â€˜totally unfoundedâ€™â€™ and a figment of the â€˜â€˜imagination of the Akali-BJP combineâ€™â€™.

However, the statement, issued by the public relations department, surprised some ministers on whose behalf it had been issued on Thursday. When contacted, they conceded they were not aware of such a statement but were anxious to know about its contents. They owned up the statement, nevertheless, and even those who were in the forefront of dissidence in the CLP suggesting that they just could not afford to violate party discipline especially when the party was facing â€˜â€˜its most critical electoral battleâ€™â€™ in the five state assemblies next month.

The thirteen ministers who supposedly issued the joint statement belong to both the loyalist and the dissident camps. They are: Jagjit Singh, Lal Singh, Khushal Behal, Partap Singh Bajwa, Ramesh Chander Dogra, Gurchet Singh Bhullar, Mohinder Singh Kay Pee, Santokh Singh, Sardul Singh, Jasjeet Singh Randhawa, Amarjeet Singh Samra, Ashwani Sekhri and Mohinder Kumar Rinwa.

Some prominent cabinet ministers, including agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and minister higher education Harnam Dass Johar who had raised the issue of Vigilance Bureau (VB) acting against their own ministers were left out. The statement said that the CLP was â€˜â€˜completely unitedâ€™â€™ and had â€˜â€˜full faith and confidence in the leadership of Amarinder Singhâ€™â€™.

Holding the Akalis and BJP responsible for the media reports, the statement said that the â€˜â€˜propaganda of dissidence and unrest in the CLP is the brain-child of the Akali-BJP combineâ€™â€™. Observers say that the Congress has started a â€˜â€˜damage control exerciseâ€™â€™ as reports of dissidence may affect the partyâ€™s prospects in the four states.

By putting the entire blame on the BJP, which, it says, is anxious to see him out of electioneering, Amarinder loyalists have given him the credit for Congress victory in HP and also played up his potential in ensuring BJP defeat in other states.

1,MSIL wants govt to ban other states' lotteries,"BANGALORE: Mysore Sales International Limited (MSIL) will urge the government to ban lotteries of other states from being sold in the state, MSIL officials said on Thursday.

The government lotteries have a trade volume of almost Rs 15 crore a day and this has been threatened by the recent influx of lotteries from other states, particularly the North East, the officials said.

â€œThere is a lot of fraud in the way these lotteries are conducted. Although they have been given the sanction of their state governments, they are operated by independent traders. Besides, the revenue that the Karnataka government gets is a marginal 0.25 per cent only, while MSIL has maintained a steady growth rate of 10-15 per cent,â€� said MSIL director (marketing) M. K. Chidambaranath.

Such a ban will definitely help MSIL. Punjab and Tamil Nadu have been successful in effecting a blanket ban on lotteries from other states being sold in the state. â€œWe have studied how the governments in Punjab and Tamil Nadu have banned all other lotteries from being sold in the state. This has been recommended to the state government. As per Supreme Court directives, the state canâ€™t ban lotteries from the North East onlyâ€�, he added. MSIL managing director Meera Saksena said, â€œThere are too many such lotteries happening every day with a draw happening practically every minute.

Playwin, the online lottery operated by the state government is facing competition from many new entrants like Inlott, which in a very short time has managed to open 400 counters across the state.

Asked what the state government was doing in light of the recent deaths of farmers in the state, which is happening apparently due to online lotteries, MSIL chairman G K Venkatashiva Reddy said, â€œWe are looking into it.â€�

2,Sultan of swing plays political hardball,"MUMBAI: For a man who has been known variously as cricket superstar, playboy and politician (women like to keep it simple and call him hunk), Imran Khan has an appealing qualityâ€”heâ€™s shy.

Schooled in the art of hustings speak, he can (and does) ad lib with ardour on worthy concerns like the need for â€œconfidence-building measuresâ€™â€™ between India and Pakistan and the importance of fighting corruption in public life. But when the bouncers get personal (and interesting), he blushes and stonewalls.

Exampleâ€”Does wife Jemima, who has a fashion line, design his clothes? â€œNo, no she doesnâ€™t,â€™â€™ he mumbles, visibly embarrassed. Is he still asked whether his marriage to the Goldsmith heiress is a Jewish conspiracy to get Pakistan under American control? â€œI used to be asked, but itâ€™s fizzled out now,â€™â€™ is all he will say. Dressed in a white Pathan suit and embroidered jacket, Mr Khan, who is in the city for the Wisden cricket awards, is taking questions from the media at host Parmeshwar Godrejâ€™s Walkeshwar bungalow â€˜Aashrayeâ€™, an edifice which sprouts like a glass-and-marble Xanadu from the sea.

Itâ€™s been a long day for the cricketerâ€”heâ€™s just flown in from Jeddah, and good Muslim that he is, is running on empty in observance of Ramzan. But there are no smudges of fatigue and he wears his 51 years with consummate savoir faire. After playing the field in more ways than one for the better part of his adult life, the past seven years have been devoted to doing the honourable thing by cause and country.

In some ways, Imran Khan is a Pakistani Tehelka of sorts, a committed but eventually ineffective voice against corruption, whose party Tehreek-e-Insaaf has only one seat in Pakistanâ€™s national parliament. And although Mr Khan puts the poor showing down to the fact that his party withdrew support to Gen Pervez Musharraf barely two months before the election, leaving voters confused, there is little doubt that for the moment at least, he is like the twelfth man in Pakistani politics.

To his credit, he has foregone offers of cabinet seats and other political cookies to stick by his anti-corruption stand. â€œNo I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m being unrealistically idealist,â€™â€™ he says. â€œWhen the biggest crooks in Pakistan join Gen Musharrafâ€™s party, how could I be part of it? It would have negated everything I stood for.â€™â€™ As the skipper who brought home the 1992 World Cup, he was the darling of the establishment but his crusader role has changed all that.

Benazir Bhutto and he were in Oxford together (along with Vikram Mehta, chairman of Shell India), and good friends at that. â€œBut for the last ten years I havenâ€™t really talked to her,â€™â€™ he says, adding somewhat sheepishly, â€œBut now weâ€™re on the same side of the fenceâ€”anti-Musharraf, I mean.â€™â€™ Any political conversation conducted anywhere on the globe today is incomplete without a question on the post-9\11 scenario.

How is Pakistan dealing with its label of â€œrogue stateâ€™â€™ and accusations of â€œIslamic terrorismâ€™â€™? â€œContrary to these labels, Pakistan has always been a moderate country,â€™â€™ he says. â€œReligious parties have never won more than six per cent of the seats, itâ€™s always centrist parties which have been voted in. 9\11 shifted the spectrum to the right, but thatâ€™s only a temporary shift, and itâ€™s sheerly because of Americaâ€™s misconceived arrogance. It was the most ridiculous war on terrorism.

History will show that itâ€™s one of the biggest blunders they committed.â€™â€™ It was Pakistanâ€™s misfortune, says Mr Khan, to lose Mr Jinnah within a year of Partition. â€œA man of his stature would have nurtured democracy, just like Mr Nehru did in India,â€™â€™ he says. â€œOf course, we are lagging behind you, but just because a country has elections, it doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s a democracyâ€”there should be a move to develop an independent judicial system, an accountable bureaucracy and free media.â€™â€™

The most positive sign in Pakistan was the opening up of the media. â€œWe have a completely free media, especially the print media,â€™â€™ says Mr Khan. â€œPreviously, even when we had a democratic government, the media wasnâ€™t free, so this is tremendous sign.â€™â€™ New TV channels had also mushroomed, challenging the official mouthpiece Pakistan Television, which, much like Doordarshan, continued to toe the official line, he said.

But Imran Khan is no stranger to censorship, and has long given in to the diktats of the two censor officials in his life, sons Suleiman and Qassim. â€œAs soon as I switch on to cricket the boys say, â€˜Not boring cricket, Abba,â€™ so I have to change to something else,â€™â€™ he laughs. â€œUsually itâ€™s a wildlife programme.â€™â€™

3,IGP scam may herald a political upheaval,"LUCKNOW: The Indira Gandhi Pratishthan (IGP) is likely to set off a political storm which could have ramifications at the national level also.

By allowing changes in land use, the then urban development minister Lalji Tandon was aimed at ensuring that the BSP and the Congress would be at each otherâ€™s throat and the Congress and the Samajwadi Party did not come closer.

The seeds for the present imbroglio were sown in 1984 when it was decided that 28 acres of land would be allotted to the Indira Gandhi Pratishthan â€˜schemeâ€™ at Gomtinagar.

While on January 20, 1992, when ammendments to the master plan were finalised, the â€˜land useâ€™ of IGP was â€˜community and cultural facilitiesâ€™, on February 2, 1994, the â€˜land useâ€™ was changed to IGP, implying that the IGP is now no more a project but a land use, which, in turn is a constitutional and statutory provision.

The allotted land measured about 28.01 acre.

However, on August 21, 1996, by process of law, land use of some other plots in Ujariaon, measuring about 4.05 acres, was changed from green belt to hotel (commercial).

On January 24, 1997, a letter from the then principal secretary housing, AP Singh, categorically mentioned the execution of IGP and the process to be adopted.

On November 27, 1999, again by process of law, land use in Jugauli Bhikampur of plot numbers â€” 57 mi, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111 and 112 mi measuring about 4.9 acre were changed from park and playground to hotel (commercial).

On February 7, 1997, as per a letter from Singh, a committee of senior bureaucrats and technocrats of state was constituted for the purpose to finalise the conditions of tender for execution of the IGP.

On January 24, 2001, out of the 28.01 acre, three acre of land use was converted by, process of law, from IGP to software technology park.

The land use of the remaining land was left as IGP.

In June, 2002, the state government took an administrative decision to change the nature of project from IGP to Dr Ambedkar museum cum library without changing the land use, in contravention of the master plan and land use provisions, both statutory provisions as per Section 16 of the UP Urban Planning And Development Act.

In October 2002, Mayawati finally laid the foundation stone with Rs 40 crore as initial amount released to LDA to function as nodal agency, but, the work was sublet to UPRNN in contravention of an earlier decision to invite tender quotations.

In one year the cost of the project escalated to Rs 73.90 crore and finally to Rs 84.51 crore. The official date for the completion of the project was August 15, 2003.

Interestingly, Mayawati inaugurated this project in phases and finally on August 24, 2003, she inaugurated the main part. The sanction for Rs 73.90 crore was cleared by the cabinet on August 25, 2003, Mayawatiâ€™s last day in office.

On October 6, 2003, the LDA board cleared the entire project of Rs 84.51 crore giving it a post facto sanction. However, the state governmentâ€™s sanction was still pending.

For this mega dream project of former CM, the funds were allegedly diverted from that meant for development of small and medium townships of UP, equally shared by state and Central governments. Part of the funding was also done from central assistance.

Moreover, the interior development works worth Rs 6.89 crore were executed but the sanction was obtained as late as October 6, 2003 whereas the work order was issued on July 18, 2003. The firm from New Delhi, which was entrusted with the work on July 11, 2003, offered their price a day in advance to the tender notice issued on July 12, 2003.

A committee of senior bureaucrats of UP, constituted for certain purchases, met on July 9, 2003 and decided that everything had to be completed prior to July 31, 2003. In its meeting on July 17 and July 21, it hastily made the entire purchases and obtained the rectification/approval on October 6, 2003 as post facto sanction. Furthermore, the state government vide its letter of July 15, 2003, also issued certain directions on the above works/purchases which also completed on July 31, 2003.

In the meantime, the court, in its judgment of April 2003, was allegedly misled by the departments, even as the UP council was allegedly misled by Tandon.

While Amit Puri, who espoused the Jhandewala park cause, put a demand â€œto seal the entire documents and an order for a CBI inquiry into the scam,â€� he appealed to the court to take suo moto cognizance.

Puri alleged that â€œall concerned parties had misled the former advocate general, the court and the UP council on facts to please Mayawati by suppressing their consciousness.â€�

When contacted, UPCC spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh said that the Congress will raise the issue in the House and apprise the Speaker of the irregularity and ask him to take appropriate action. However, Tandon said that whatever had been proposed technically had been constructed, only the name had been changed.

He said, â€œIf the IGP belonged to an organisation and it claimed the rights then it would be a difficult situation, but, as it was entirely a government undertaking, the government had every right to change the name and shift the IGP to another place.â€�

He, however, admitted that it did not set a good precedent. Tandon also said that he had not misguided the council and had stated the situation as it was. What however bothered even Tandon was whether the LDA have the funds to construct the IGP.

When asked whether the funds for the project were diverted from the Deen Dayal Nagrodaya Yojana, he said that the money had probably come from the contingency funds.

Asked what could be the solution, Tandon said that it was entirely in the governmentâ€™s hands whether to return it to the earlier status of the IGP or to only change its name. Will the Samajwadi Party oblige the Congress?

4,Govt increases number of HC judges to 749,"NEW DELHI: A year after Arun Jaitley launched fast track court that would ensure speedy delivery of justice, he has announced that 94 more judges posts had been created for the same purpose.

But, proposed increase in the judges strength would not yield expected results if the high courts do not recommend names to fill vacant posts. Of the approved 655 judges posts in the 21 high courts, about 100 posts have been lying vacant for a long time now. Over 2.5 crore cases are awaiting disposal in different subordinate courts across the country.

â€˜â€˜I have been writing to the chief justices of the high courts to send recommendations for filling the vacant posts. The Chief Justice of India has also been reminding the high courts to initiate process for filling the existing vacancies,â€™â€™ Jaitley said. After the first review of judges strength in 1995, it was increased to 618.In the 1999 review it was increased to 655.

After the latest hike, the strength is 749. The Patna High Court would get 12 additional judges while the strength of judges in the high courts of Kerala and Orissa is to be increased by 11 each, Jaitley said. Gauhati High Court would get eight more judges while Madras High Court would get five. When asked why the bigger high courts at Allahabad and Mumbai were not getting additional judges, Jaitley replied that the additional judges strength was sanctioned based on disposal rate and the number of cases pending there.

â€˜â€˜The strength of Allahabad, Bombay and Madras high courts will be increased by conversion of posts of additional judges into permanent ones,â€™â€™ he said. The Delhi HC, whose disposal rate was below the national average of 1976 cases per judge per year, managed to get three more judges post, thus having a strength for 36.

5,Tale of two princes,"NEW DELHI: First the father and then the son. How many people can boast of meeting two generations of the royal family? Prem Nath, a 50-year-old policeman and a wrestler of international repute can.

A three decade old photograph of Duke of Edinburgh decorating him with a gold medal at the Munich Commonwealth Games, has got Prem Nath a royal promise from Prince Charles. â€˜â€˜I will tell my father I met you, â€˜â€™ said the prince. An assistant commissioner with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) police, Prem Nath met Prince Charles and floored him with the old photograph.

â€˜â€˜He was impressed with the way I had kept the photograph,â€™â€™ said a proud Prem Nath, an Arjuna Award winner of 1972. Nath had beaten a British national in the finals of the wrestling championship at the Commonwealth Games and had won an offer from the Duke himself for coaching the young wrestlers in Britain. He had declined the royal offer but had given a one rupee coin as a memento.

This time Nath could not give a memento to the Royal. â€˜â€˜No I did not give him anything. DMRC gave a memento to him to remember the Metro ride. All I wanted him to do was to visit my akhaara where I am training youngsters. One of my students is representing India in the international competitions.

But it may not possible for the such a busy man as the prince,â€™â€™ he said. â€˜â€˜I was just 18 when Prince Philip had watched the entire wrestling game and had decorated me with the gold medal,â€™â€™ said the overwhelmed wrestler. â€˜â€˜Prince Charles asked me how old I was then. I told him I was studying in college when I met his father.â€™â€™

8,Votebank politics drains exchequer,"MUMBAI: For decades it has been the Maharashtra politicianâ€™s safest electoral cushion. But running the cotton monopoly procurement scheme has resulted in an accumulated loss of Rs 4,200 crore to the stateâ€™s finances.

Add another Rs 515 crore for this fiscal and the stateâ€™s budget planning will be the first casualty. The Congress-led Democratic Front (DF) on Wednesday announced the rate of Rs 2,500 on every quintal of cotton purchased at the state-owned procurement centres in Vidarbha.

â€˜â€˜The state will have to introduce a cut in the development plan to fund the scheme and the cut would be anywhere in the range of 10 per cent to 20 per cent,â€™â€™ warned CM Sushilkumar Shinde on Wednesday.

Funds for development activities have been shrinking. Politics of vote banks, however, took precedence over governance and prudent financial management with both the Congress and NCP raring to outdo each other for higher price to cotton.

The scheme has already affected at least seven cooperative banks who had lent Rs 443 crore to the Maharashtra State Cotton Growers Marketing Federation in 2000 on assurance of 15 per cent interest on the money.
