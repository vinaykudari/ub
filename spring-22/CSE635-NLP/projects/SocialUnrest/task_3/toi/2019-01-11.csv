0,New policy sees more naxalites surrender,"karimnagar: karimnagar, hitherto notorious as a breeding ground for the naxalite movement, is becoming a centre for anti-nax-alite strategies. multi-pronged poli-cies adopted by the police to con-tain the naxalite movement are beginning to show results. in the recent past, many senior cadres have laid down their arms before the admin-istration and joined the main-stream. the re-forms under the guidance of dis-trict superinten-dent of police p r s praveen ku-mar appear to be yielding the de-sired results in areas like manthani, mahamutharam and other bastions of people's war (pw) naxalites. the district police in karimnagar are concentrating on the surren-ders, rehabilitation and counselling process. a cursory glance on the number of surrenders revealed that 618 naxalites belonging to various naxalite groups capitulated in this district and the counselling too was forcing the underground cadres to join the mainstream. while aware-ness is setting the tempo of at-tracting surren-ders, the policy of providing fa-cilities and com-pensation to the families of nax-alite victims in this district was instilling confi-dence among the police force. recently, the police implement-ed a scheme of allotting house sites to the kin of naxalite victims in karimnagar. this process, according to karimnagar police officials, would be extended to other naxalite-in-fested zones shortly.

1,Bihar govt’s inaction puts BNMU teachers in a spot,"saharsa: to pay or not to pay the salary -- is the serious dilemma that the b n mandal university administration has been facing for the last three months, thanks largely to non-compliance with the supreme court's interim order by the bihar government. the higher education department of the state government has already released the salary grants of all universities, including the bnmu, for the months of october and november, 2001, but whether the university has received the salary draft or not is still a mystery. eventually, the teachers and non-teaching employees who have not been paid their salary for the last three months (from october to december 2001), appear to have been made a scapegoat in the fighting between the university and the state government. the situation is feared to turn explosive as the teachers and employees have planned to launch agitation in their respective college units. nevertheless, they feel shaky and rudderless because of the bnmu teachers association being allegedly defunct for the last couple of years. the piquant situation has arisen after the supreme court's interim order of october 12, 2001 in a special leave petition (slp) in which the apex court while constituting a one-man inquiry committee for the final solution of the long-drawn dispute over regularisation of the services of teaching and non-teaching employees in 40 new constituent colleges of bihar and jharkhand, has also ordered to pay them full salary alongwith admissible allowances till the final disposal of the case. during the pendency of the court proceeding, the staff, irrespective of the nature of their posts -- whether sanctioned or recommended -- will in no way be disturbed. emboldened by the apex court's order, the teachers and non-teaching employees in six new constituent colleges under the bnmu, have been exerting pressure on the university authorities to ensure full payment of their salary. on the other hand, bihar government has failed to enhance the salary grant of this university, as required for compliance with the supreme court order. according to the sources in the university, vice-chancellor amar nath sinha has written several letters to the higher education department for enhancing the salary grant in the light of the sc order but his requests and reminders have fallen on deaf ears. meanwhile, the teachers and employees working in 22 old constituent colleges (including the post-graduate centre at saharsa) are getting restive and indignant as they feel that they are being punished for no fault of theirs. why should our salary be withheld when the state government has sent the amount as per the pay fixation done by itself? why should we suffer when there is no dispute over our service conditions?"" asked a teacher. according to these teachers, the onus of implementing the sc order lies on the bihar government which had filed the slp and, hence, the university must disburse the salary as per the orders of the patna high court, until the salary grant is suitably increased. but the vice-chancellor, caught between the devil and the deep sea, has adopted an evasive attitude by refusing to receive the salary grant released by the state government. it is learnt that the state government has released the salary for december too to all the universities. the grant of bnmu has, however, been withheld due to non-submission of the utilisation certificate of the previous two months.

2,Clean air: Should you trust your govt?,"new delhi: who was the first to announce the formation of a committee on an automobile fuel policy? it was madanlal khurana, a delhi bjp leader and a high voltage spokesman for transport operators. he should not have had anything to do with the appointment of a union government committee. four months later who was the first to welcome the findings of the committee? it was khurana again, this time declaring victory over proponents of cng as a clean fuel. has the committee, headed by r a mashelkar, director-general of the council for scientific and industrial reasearch, been a pawn in a game to win votes in delhi, skew a court battle and stifle an environmental campaign? mashelkar vehemently denies it, but it is a fact that the committee's interim report was rushed through the cabinet in just eight days, which is really breakneck speed. it was also given all the sanctity of a final report. the committee was set up in the wake of the problems of introducing cng in delhi. its job was to help choose a clean fuel and engine technology. its primary concern was public health and effect of pollution on ordinary people. the interim report has said that any fuel and technology can be used as long as emission norms are met. this has been interpreted to mean that buses can run on diesel in delhi and the days of long cng queues are over. the government has done nothing to contradict this impression. but in his interview with this paper on wednesday, mashelkar said that was not the case. the committee was not against any fuel and cng could well be used and should be made available in plenty with the proper conversion of engines. it took an interview to get this out. the report, on its part, clearly says that there is a shortage of cng. when asked to explain this, mashelkar said the committee's observation was based on information provided by the union petroleum ministry. did the ministry then mislead the committee? more intriguing is the apparent unwillingness of the committee to pin down the government. it does not seem to have sought an answer for the tardy manner in which the government has gone about supplying cng, accepting deadlines in court and then missing them. a committee cosisting of men of science whose primary concern was public health should have been eager to get such an explanation. regarding the oil industry, the report says that huge investments are needed to provide the best quality diesel. it makes no mention of the corresponding cost of pollution, estimated at rs 1000 crore for health a year in delhi alone. it also omits the fact that four refineries —— reliance, mathura, haldia and bharat petroleum —— are already in a position to supply the best quality diesel.

6,LU makes strict rules for hostels,"lucknow: life in lucknow university hostels will not be easy anymore. students who have had a 'free for all' environment till last year, will have to abide by some disciplinary regulations from this year. while till last year there was no restriction in movement of the students, from this year the reporting time for students have been fixed at 10 pm. thereafter, the gates will remain close till 5 am and no student or visitor would be allowed to enter the hostel during that period. also, the rules say that students will have to maintain and take care of their rooms and belongings themselves. walking on newly renovated lawns, plucking flowers and spitting on the corridors will also be banned. those found violating these norms would be penalised with a fine of rs 50-100. there will be rules for hostel provosts, assistant provosts and other employees also. while daily round of provost/assistant provost has been made a mandatory feature, employees will be assigned the job of reporting the violation of rules by the students. while the rules are meant to maintain discipline and law and order, none on the campus have taken them seriously. the reason: rowdy student politics and inactive lu officials. when they could not stop students from beating up teachers, how can they expect that they will follow these rules, said a provost.

8,PU paying the price of government neglect,"patna: patna university, the seventh oldest university in the country, is likely to pay the price of its utter neglect in the hands of the state government as it holds little chance of its inclusion in the list of 25 universities to be developed as centres of excellence by the ugc. though the university does not lag behind others in respect of talent and potential, its claim for excellence is unlikely to get favour of the ugc owing to lack of infrastructural facilities and teaching staff. vice-chancellor of pu k k jha, who presented the university's case for its development as the centre of excellence at the ugc office in new delhi on monday, had to cut a sorry figure when the ugc chairman inquired of him about the implementation of the revised ugc scales of pay, number of teachers serving the university and regularity of payment of salaries to the teachers and staff of the university. he could not satisfy the ugc officials as all these matters were related to the attitude of the state government. the vice-chancellors of as many as 90 universities, including central ones, selected from across the country presented their claims before the ugc. that the state government has completely lost its credibility in the eyes of the ugc came to the fore when the ugc officials took strong exception to the non-implementation of pay scales revised by the ugc in 1996 despite the fact that the government was given the required funds for the purpose long back. how could the dissatisfied teachers impart proper training to their taughts, asked the ugc officials. bihar happens to be the only state in the country where the college and university teachers were not getting the revised ugc scales till date. the ugc officials were also aware of the fact that salaries were not being paid regularly to the teachers and other staff of the university. the most depressing fact, as per the ugc officials, was the ever declining strength of teachers in the university. only about 500 teachers were serving the university against the total sanctioned strength of over 1000. the university's plea for renovation of old, dilapidated buildings of this university was, however, accepted by the ugc and the university was asked to submit a detailed proposal to this effect. the ugc officials clarified that the funds sanctioned for the purpose would be released to the university directly and, not through the state government, as they have little faith in the state government machinery. it may be mentioned here that the union hrd ministry has initiated a move for the conversion of allahabad university into a central university and for developing 25 other universities as centres of excellence for ensuring their sound development.

10,FCI told to purchase paddy from farmers,"sambalpur: the activists of orissa gana parishad (ogp) came down heavily on the previous congress government and the present one, both in the state and at the centre for the wrong policies that crippled the farmers of western orissa. to get rid of the crisis, the party demanded food corporation of india (fci) to purchase paddy directly from the farmers. in a statement issued by siddharatha das, the president of district unit of ogp, it has been stated that when fci was formed as a registered company, its main objective under the article of memorandum was to provide minimum support price to the farmers. but the previous congress government for its vested interest introduced the incondite 'miller-agent' system that has been negatively conduced. instead of rectifying the mistake, the present government of bjpbjd coalition rather works like the congress, the party alleged. it further alleged that the state government, simply for the sake of power, has surrendered before the centre and failed miserably to safeguard the interest of the state, particularly of the farming community. it further states that the rice mills of western orissa are going to be sick very soon due to the ambiguous policies of the government. as a result, rs 150 crores of different nationalised and cooperative banks will turn bad debt and 40,000 labourers engaged directly or indirectly will loose their livelihood. on the other hand the state government has not yet taken up seriously to purchase paddy directly from the farmers and supply 30 lakh tons of rice to central rice pull as per the stipulated quota. it further demands to ban import of all varieties of non-basmati rice from other states to create a market for the local rice. like other states, fci at this juncture should come forward to purchase paddy directly from farmers and the state mps should influence the centre to follow similar practice in orissa, ogp suggests.
