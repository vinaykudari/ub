0,"State govt to offer VRS, wage war to cut costs","mumbai: the abolition of additional posts, a 1.5 per cent savings in wages in every department, the golden handshake for surplus employees, a cap on moribund state-sponsored schemes and the curtailment of expenditure on transport are some of the bold measures which the cash-strapped maharashtra government announced on saturday as part of its austerity drive. government departments have been asked to prepare a list of surplus posts which can be suspended after a comprehensive review by october 31, 2001. surplus staff with ten years in service can avail of the voluntary retirement scheme (vrs). however, they will be granted an additional five years while calculating pension benefits. excess staff, still to complete ten years in service, will not get any pension but their service will be enhanced by five years for gratuity. cm vilasrao deshmukh made these announcements at a post-cabinet meeting press conference held at sahyadri on saturday. the state government seems to have laid greater emphasis on curtailment of overhead expenditures, including the wage bill.this could,however,open a can of worms for the vilasrao deshmukh ministry in view of strident opposition from a slew of state employees' unions. the govt. also plans to integrate identical schemes which, the chief minister said, would hereafter be implemented with the most minimum manpower''. the state government has also decided to put a cap on the creation of new posts in the administration, mr deshmukh said. even ministers and top bureaucrats will not be spared in the current cost-cutting drive. as it is, we have fixed a ceiling of rs 65,000 for two months on the telephone bills of ministers and have instructed them to fly economy class.the government will no longer bear the flight expenditure of their personal aides,'' he said. the cost-cutting exercise in the transport sector was necessary in view of the huge fleet of government cars and their maintenance. a whopping rs 230 crore is spent every year on wages to drivers, mr deshmukh said. there will be a complete ban on purchase of new vehicles.the procurement of new cars would be matched with the sale of old ones, he added. the state government has strongly recommended the use of motorbikes instead of cars and jeeps in view of the recession. emphasising the need to cut down official tours, mr deshmukh declared that officials should travel by rail instead of by government vehicles and restrict air travel. meanwhile, the brihanmumbai municipal corporation will have six more corporators following the ruling democratic front government's decision to increase the strength of all 15 municipal corporations in the state and reorganise the municipal ward limits. the decision assumes political significance in view of the impending civic elections across the state. the move is aimed at accommodating a greater number of political workers in the democratic process at the grass-roots level.

1,"No sex, no violence..lekin box-office chahta hai","mumbai: clearly, mainstream hindi cinema's success formula, or whatever there was of it, is now khalas in mumbai. clean bowled. gangulified. the back-to-back success of ashutosh gowariker's lagaan and farhan akhtar's dil chahta hai (dch)—both films that, on paper, only reckless chumps would back—has highlighted the momentum gained by the fresh new sensibility in bollywood. lagaan, with ordinary villagers beating their british colonial masters at cricket, is a metaphor for the triumph of the human spirit, while dil chahta hai is a refreshing buddy film about the lives and loves of an irrepressible trio. says aamir khan, actor-producer of lagaan and star of dil chahta hai, lagaan and dch are so radically different from the kind of film that supposedly does well in mainstream cinema, and so diametrically different from each other as well. because they've been released together, and both are doing well, it seems as if yeh to poora change ho gaya.'' in fact, a young and experimental attitude has been weaseling its way into the crevices of mainstream cinema right through the '90s, creating a flash every now and then. but the present box-office effervescence seems to consolidate the trend, kick-started by directors mostly in their 20s and 30s.what's more, it makes the intoxicating, unheard-of proposition that in hindi cinema, it pays to take risks, without even being risque.that you can sew up the box office without a single scene of sex or violence.that people want to see films about ordinary people like you and me. hallelujah! the films of the '90s which reflected this new sensibility include shekhar kapur's bandit queen, ramgopal varma's satya, m a h e s h manjrekar's astitva, mani ratnam's roja, john mathew matthan's sarfarosh, e. nivas' love ke liye kuch bhi karega, kundan shah's kya kehna, rakesh mehra's aks and priyadarshan's hera pheri. most of these broke free of the stranglehold of romantic formula 44 defining the cinema of the decade. then there are the hardcore mainstream films made by what one might call theyoung fogeys, like karan johar's kuch kuch hota hai, aditya chopra's dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge and sanjay leela bhansali's hum dil de chuke sanam, that sheath their bedrock of solid, conservative indian values in shimmering lycra and blue eyeshadow.

2,Delhi govt plans 10% sales tax on CNG,"new delhi: following the maharashtra example, the delhi government plans to levy a sales tax on cng. at present, cng costs rs 12.21 per kg in delhi, while in mumbai it costs rs 18.35 per kg. the delhi government had exempted cng from sales tax but finance minister mahinder singh saathi now says the tax rate will vary between 5 and 10 per cent. ""we will decide the tax slab at the cabinet level. it would be moderate because we do not want to strain the cng vehicle owners. but as the entire city transport is gradually shifting to cng, exemption is no longer economically feasible,"" he says. following the supreme court order to convert all commercial vehicles in the city to cng-mode, the city buses, autos and taxis have switched from diesel and petrol. saathi says the government had given tax exemption as an incentive to owners of commercial vehicles. ""we wanted to show the court that we are serious about the court's order. but now, as our revenues are likely to suffer, we are being forced to levy the tax,"" he said. according to officials, the government earns about rs 800 crore from sales tax on diesel and petrol. the government has already hiked the sales tax on petrol by 20 per cent and diesel by 12 per cent. the government is also alarmed at the losses incurred by oil companies after cng was introduced as an alternative fuel. according to sources, these companies have lost almost 50 per cent of their market share in delhi since april last year.

3,"Harmonise food laws, rationalise taxes: Task force","new delhi: perturbed over post-harvest wastage of over 30 per cent of fruits and vegetables, a high-level task force has recommended quick steps to harmonise food laws, rationalise tax structure and strengthen marketing network for making the food processing sector vibrant. despite 600 million tonnes of food production, almost 25-30 per cent of the fruits and vegetables are spoiled at the post harvest stages due to poor storage and transportation, lack of infrastructure and inadequacy of marketing set up, the national task force on food processing said. ""india wastes more fruits and vegetables than are consumed in a country like britain. the problem is further compounded by the lack of marketing infrastructure, with farmers on many occasions having to dump their surplus produce"", task force chairman omesh saigal told pti. describing the tax structure in the country on processed food as amongst the highest in the world, he said it has been a major single impediment in attracting investments, both locally and from abroad. strongly recommending creation of an ""enabling environment"" through fiscal intervention, as sought in the proposed food processing policy, he said the need of the hour is to rationalise the tax structure, harmonise food laws by an appropriate enactment and create market for processed foods. quick steps should also be taken to set up low cost pre-cooling facilities near farms, encourage application of new technologies, build up a strong innfrastructural base for production of value added products and develop agro-food parks. saigal said the food chain in the country is largely inefficient mainly due to the presence of a large number of intermediaries. it is common to have six to seven intermediaries during fresh produce procurement in fruit and vegetable sector in india, while in britain there are only two or three middlemen involved in such process, he said. the major disadvantage of the prevailing system is that the farmer gets a very low price for his product and the end user pays a high price. ""the farm to kitchen price ratio may be 1:8 as compared to 1:1.8 in developed nations and this higher price is paid for a product that has not improved its value in any way. the increase in price is for the number of hands it has passed through"", saigal said. therefore, he said, it is essential to adopt a new market model or modify the existing model which can be done by studying the supply chain that has been evolved by various companies through elimination of middlemen and utilisation of the retail networks including roadside kiosks and dhabas. saigal said the proposed food processing policy also seeks to promote backward linkages between farmers and processors by utilising the existing infrastructure of cooparatives and panchayats and encourage development of futures market. in addition, forward linkages should also be promoted between processors and the market while strengthening marketing capabilities to enhance competitive capabilities for meeting wto challenges as well as boosting exports, he said.

4,'UP Cong MLAs may quit if polls not held in Oct',"lucknow: uttar pradesh congress on sunday warned that the party legislators in the state assembly might resign, if the elections in the state were not held by october next claiming that the term of current assembly expires in september and not in march next year. ""our legislators may resign if the polls were not held in october as several congress mlas have expressed their desire to resign. the term of the current vidhan sabha expires in september and not in march next year and elections should be held immediately after that,"" up congress president sri prakash jaiswal claimed while speaking to reporters here. launching a scathing attack on the rajnath singh government, jaiswal said the law and order situation in the state had ""changed for the worse and a jungle raj prevails"". he said the recent incidents of killings of members of the minority community and communal riots at several places had ""proved the hollowness of the chief minister's claim that all was well on the law and order front"". demanding judicial inquiries into the recent killings and riots, he said: ""the government was avoiding inquiries as it will be exposed."" the party would stage a dharna at the gpo park in the state capital on monday as part of its agitational programmes, which would be attended by aicc general secretary ghulam nabi azad and some other senior leaders.

5,Violation of rly rules led to Jamui mishap,"danapur: the preliminary inquiry into the jamui train accident which, so far, has taken a toll of 10 lives, has revealed that traffic rules were blatantly flouted and safety norms, particularly at the gradient point, were thrown to the winds. expressing serious concern over the lapses in the safety measures, a railway official at danapur said that the magnitude of the mishap would have been greater, had the wagons collided with the patliputra express, which crossed jamui about half an hour before. according to sources, the entire stretch of 54 km between jhajha and kiul, is located on the steep gradient. unfortunately, the railways have not bothered to build a ""sand hump"" either at jamui or giddhaur to avert any mishap. if reports are to be believed, this is not the solitary accident. several such accidents took place in the past near jamui. however, barring this accident, no casualty had occurred earlier since there was no direct collision with a passengers' train, sources said. the ill-fated goods train, better known as ""dmt"" special, had first brought stone chips to kiul first from jamalpur on thursday morning. while two guards work the dmt special, four crew members, two drivers and two assistant drivers are put on duty to work such a special goods train, especially during the day. there is a rest van attached to a special dmt train for guards and crew members. on the fateful day, the ""load"" was stabled at giddhaur about 5.30 pm on the up line. it is said the public works inspector (pwi) of jamui had asked for a block for about two and a half hours to unload stone chips, which was not granted by the danapur control room keeping in view movements of passenger trains in the evening. accordingly, it is not known who actually gave orders for the dmt special to move back from giddhaur towards jamui. only a thorough probe into the matter could reveal the truth, it is felt. in the case of shunting or unloading materials from wagons, the station master (sm) or the yard master issues ""ops-4"" memo to both guard and driver of the goods train. the presence of the yard master and guard is a must at the site. it appears that in the jamui accident, this vitally important rule was not followed. according to a railway board directive, it is essentially important that the jammer is fixed on the tracks if the load is stabled at a gradient point to prevent the possibility of its rolling back. surprisingly, no such steps were taken by the station master of giddhaur which finally proved fatal for the passengers of the muzaffarpur-sealdah passenger train, sources said. it, however, is pointed out that railway works, like unloading of materials on the gradient point, are carried out mostly on the ""verbal order"" at such vulnerable places. to educate about safety to railway staff, especially the station and cabin staff, is seldom done by the safety officials concerned of the danapur division.

6,'DMK trying to topple AIADMK govt',"chennai: leaders of various political parties on sunday charged dmk with trying to 'topple' the aiadmk regime in tamil nadu by attempting to create law and order problems and obstructing the government from discharging its functions. speaking at a rally organised by tamil nadu peasants and workers party faction led by pon kumar, the leaders asserted that they would not allow the dmk's ""game plan"", to provide the centre with a reason to impose article 356 of the constitution and dismiss the state government, to succeed. tmc leader and rajya sabha member b s gnanadesikan said his party would not allow the designs of former chief minister and dmk president m karunanidhi to get the jayalalithaa government dismissed. referring to the requisitioning of the services of three police officers, including city police chief k muthukaruppan, by the centre, he asked why union home minister l k advani, who had recently said he had to consult j&k chief minister farooq abdullah before taking a decision regarding kashmir, did not apply the same principle on the transfer of these officers. aiadmk propaganda secretary o s manian also attacked the dmk volunteers for allegedly using unprintable epithets against women police personnel during a rally organised here by the dmk last sunday. stating that despite the 'provocative' language the police had 'exercised maximum restraint', manian charged karunanidhi with exerting pressure on the centre to dismiss the aiadmk ministry. the state government would leave no stone unturned to expose the alleged corruption during the dmk regime between 1996 and 2001, he said. state congress committee member r anbarasu alleged that karunanidhi had created a hue and cry about his arrest as he was afraid to face charges of corruption against him. aiadmk headquarters secretary and former minister k a sengottaiyan also charged the dmk with trying to return to power by dislodging the new government. tamizhaga rajiv congress founder vazhapadi ramamurthy said such rallies would continue to counter the 'anti- democratic' approach being adopted by the dmk. asking aiadmk supremo jayalalithaa to ensure all legal procedures were met before effecting arrests, ramamurthy claimed that if the elected government was dismissed or assembly dissolved, the aiadmk and its allies would secure a bigger majority than they had at present.

8,AES accuses Orissa govt of interference,"bhubaneswar: the us power major aes which is insistent on quitting the energy distribution company cesco in orissa has accused the state government of interfering in its day-to-day functioning. the latest stand-off between the government and aes arose over payment of july salary to some of the employees of cesco during the past two days on the instruction and out of the money provided by the state government. official sources said here on sunday that a letter had been received by the state government from the managing director of cesco, roberto podesta, on friday seeking clarification as to the nature of money given to the company out of which the employees were paid salary. the cesco managing director, in his letter, alleged that a few employees of the company were called by the government and given drafts and cheques with instructions to disburse salary for july. this amounts to interference in the day-to-day management of the company, the letter said. the employees, who were not paid their salary by the cesco management had, meanwhile, resorted to agitational methods. the joint action committee of the workers, employees and engineers of cesco have also served a notice threatening to go on strike from september 5 next in support of their seven-point charter of demands which included payment of salary and other dues, takeover of the power distribution business by the state-owned grid corporation of orissa ltd (gridco) and a probe against alleged financial irregularities committed by the cesco management.

9,PM plans operation to arrest economic slowdown,"new delhi: faced with the economic slowdown, the union government is planning to send out a message of hope, that the economy can stage a strong recovery in the second-half of the current fiscal. the initiative has come from the top. prime minister a.b. vajpayee is slated to discuss ways to clear the economic gloom with his two advisory councils__the one comprising captains of industry on september 7 and the other comprising economists on september 10. finance minister yashwant sinha, who will participate in these discussions, is kicking off the process by meeting bank chiefs on monday to address the problem of slowdown. this comes in the wake of several indicators pointing towards the bad shape of the indian economy. the international monetary fund (imf) had painted a fairly bleak picture of the indian economy in its annual assesment report earlier this week and said that it was critical for the authorities to put the country's fiscal position on a sustainable path. besides, standard & poor's had recently lowered india's long-term local currency sovereign credit rating by a notch to triple b-minus from triple b and revised the outlook on both local and foreign currency long-term ratings to `negative' from `stable'. the standard & poor's move was a clear signal that teh government's financial situation, under strain from internal debt, had worsened and very little effort was being made towards long-term structural reforms. the outlook revision reflected rising concern that the public finances might worsen in the years to come as vested interests continued to thwart public sector reforms. officials said the broad strategy that was likely to emerge in the next few weeks was two-fold__push ahead with the second generation reforms to restore confidence; and speed up budgeted spending on infrastructure projects to induce demand. they said no dramatic measures were in the offing, but the government wanted to send out a clear signal that it was not being bogged down by the series of financial sector scams and bad economic news in recent months. the pm's economic advisory council and the council on trade and industry have not met since february. officials say the meetings will review the progress made on the second generation of economic reforms charted out by the economic advisory council in february. the budget announced the government's intention to pursue a number of these reforms, including those in the power sector, labour laws and agriculture. now is the time to act on those. officials point out that the implementation of the second generation reforms is difficult as these require fresh legislations and cannot be carried forward through executive orders. there has been progress towards enactment of competition and bankruptcy laws. in the power sector too, the panel of chief ministers has accepted a number of recommendations of the montek singh ahluwalia committee, including the one-time settlement of the huge arrears in dues of state electricity boards to central utilities. besides, the electricity bill has also been tabled in parliament. these measures are expected to facilitate the power sector reforms and consequently, have a positive effect on the economy. but the progress on a number of other measures, such as labour law reforms, ownsizing of the government and deregulation of the agriculture sector hasbeen tardy. officials acknowledge that there is an urgent need for the government to demonstrate its will to push these tough reforms. officials emphasise that the government wants to send out a message of hope: that economy can stage a strong recovery in the second-half of the current fiscal term. monsoon rains have been good and agriculture is expected to record a positive growth this year compared to last two years of nil growth. this will help create demand for goods in rural india. also, some early signs of a recovery in the u.s. economy have just been noticed and if the global slowdown abates, the indian economy is likely to bounce back in the next few months.

12,Mukhi opposes govt move on CNG,"new delhi: the state unit of the bjp has reacted sharply to the city government's proposal to levy sales tax on compressed natural gas, calling it `regressive' and `anti-people'. opposing the proposal, leader of opposition in the vidhan sabha jagdish mukhi said the sales tax exemption on cng should stay. he said the cng vehicle operators needed financial assistance and the government's decision to do away with tax exemption would hit them badly. ``cng vehicles owners are already under heavy financial burden. they need help from the government. instead the government is planning to tax them further,'' mukhi said. he also said the government has been taking fiscal measures to control pollution in the city. `` the government gives sales tax exemption on pollution-control devices. it should maintain a similar policy on cng which has helped in bringing down pollution levels in the city,'' mukhi said. the bjp leaders said the losses on cng could be easily compensated with the increase in sales tax. ``the revenue realised by the government through sales tax is increasing every year. it can easily afford to give tax exemption to cng,'' he said.
