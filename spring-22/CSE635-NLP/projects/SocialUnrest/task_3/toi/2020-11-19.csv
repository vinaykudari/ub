0,Gujarat govt forced to inspect 'toxic' ship,"GANDHINAGAR: Environment watch-dog Greenpeace scored a major victory when the Gujarat government was forced to order an environmental inspection of the â€˜toxicâ€™ UK ship Genova Bridge.

The ship has been awaiting beaching at the Alang ship-breaking yard to be scrapped and Greenpeace activists have been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities along the international waters off the Saurashtra coast for the past week.

The victory has come as a major embarassment for the Gujarat government which had wanted the Greenpeace activists aboard their ship, Rainbow Warrior, to be arrested by the navy or coast guard, a request which was turned down. A senior official here admited that, on instructions from the Union environment ministry, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) has been asked to inquire into the matter and advise the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) if Genova Bridge fulfils international norms for ship-breaking.

Significantly, the GPCBâ€™s environmental clearance before starting to break a ship at Alang is still not obligatory. The ship-breaker obtains the clearance to break from private local bodies, appointed by the GMB to give certification.

2,"Bypolls: Main fight between SP, BSP","LUCKNOW: With Mahsi and Harora scheduled to go to the polls on Thursday, the stage is all set for a trial of strength between the ruling Samajwadi Party and the main stream opposition parties like the BSP, the BJP and the Congress.

The bypolls to both the constituencies will be the first acid test for the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government in Uttar Pradesh. The party, accordingly, has left nothing to chance to ensure the victory of its candidates Vimla Rakesh in Harora and Dilip Verma in Mahsi, just as the opposition (read BSP) appears equally determined to ensure that the SP candidates lick the dust.

Both Mahsi in Behraich and Harora (reserved) in Saharanpur seats had been held by the BSP. Harora had been vacated by former chief minister Mayawati while Mahsi had fallen vacant following the death of BSP MLA Ali Bahadur. The BSP has sought to encash the sympathy wave in Mahsi and, accordingly, had given the ticket to Jamila Khatun, widow of Ali Bahadur. BSP national president Mayawati, during her campaigning, spared no effort to touch the emotional chord amongst the voters just as she played the dalit card to the hilt in this constituency.

The issues taken up by her in Mahsi were nearly the same as in Harora except that the latter seat held a special significance for her. Ensuring the victory of her party candidate Jagpal here appeared top priority for her just as the defeat of the BSP candidate appeared top priority for Mulayam Singh Yadav. For the SP chief, the victory of his party candidate Vimla Rakesh from this seat will enable him to send the message that the people can now breathe easily under a dispensation which believes in upholding democratic norms. Needless to say, both the constituencies are witnessing a neck-and-neck fight between the SP and the BSP candidates with the Congress and the BJP way behind.

The Congress has fielded Indra Pratap Singh in Mahsi and Shakuntala Devi in Harora while the BJP has given ticket to Sureshwar Singh in Mahsi and repeated Dr Mamchandra in Harora. There is not much at stake for the BJP in both these constituencies as, during the last elections, its candidates had not performed well. For the Congress, the scene is equally dismal.

Mahsi has a total of 270,522 voters and Harora 254,148 voters.

Counting of votes for both the seats will take place on December 2.

3,Joint lesson: Students to join teachers' protest,"LUDHIANA: Hectic mobilisation is on by teachers of private affiliated colleges of Punjab to rope in the student community for what believed to be the first joint action in support of their long pending demands.

As part of the programme, the students will boycott classes in more than 130 such colleges in the state to observe education bandh on December 5.

The leaders of different students union would address the statewide protest rally to be organised by Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers Union (PCCTU) at Patiala on that day. Talking to TNN, PCCTU general secretary Dr V K Tiwari said they believed the participation of students would give more teeth to their sustained agitation to get their demands of pension-cumgratuity and maintaining 95 grant-in-aid to such colleges implemented.

The development is part of their programme for some years to build broader base in support of their justified demands by roping in the college managements, principals and non-teaching staff organisations.

Though a formal boycott call is yet to be given, the PCCTU leaders are working overtime to ensure the students'' participation.

For instance, PCCTU secretary Aminder Pal Singh has been organising meetings with the students and their leaders in the colleges affiliated to Punjabi University where the PCCTU leadership believes the studentsâ€™ unions are more active than other areas.

Apparently, the effectiveness of students'' voice is not lost upon the teachers as it was due to their pronounced protest the government had to rollback the fee hike decision.

Punjab Students Union (PSU) state executive member Harpreet Jirakh confirmed having been approached by the leaders of teachersâ€™ body in this regard.

â€˜â€˜Besides addressing their rally, we will boycott classes as their demand of restoring 95 per cent government grant is in our interest too,â€™â€™ he said terming other demands as genuine.

5,Australia eyes heavy investment Wensley,"KOLKATA: Australians have battered India at the Eden grounds, but they seem ready to make amends by increasing investment in West Bengal.

Australian high commissioner Penny Wensley called on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday to discuss co-operation in eco-tourism, health care, education, mining and port upgradation.

Briefing the media after the meeting, Wensley regretted that Australiaâ€™s investment was â€˜very lowâ€™ in West Bengal. â€œMy government and our private sector are interested in increasing business and investment here,â€� she promised.

On Wednesday, government and Australian representatives discussed specific proposals on promoting ecotourism in Sundarbans.

Wensley assured that Australian tourists would be encouraged to visit this part of the country. With the state government and Sahara India Parivar working on a Rs 540 crore joint venture at Sunderbans, tourism is bound to get a boost.

Bhattacharjee also discussed possibilities of Haldia port modernisation with investment from Australian port major P&O. The government is planning to develop another export-oriented special economic zone here, apart from Kulpi.

Australians are also keen to sell their expertise and technology in mine management and exploration. Bhattacharjee also enquired about the possibility of Australian private sector investment in medical products and equipment manufacturing in West Bengal.

The chief minister is also keen to woo foreign investors to the newly inaugurated jewellery park, Manikanchan, in the Special Economic Zone. Since Australia is also a major diamond and gold exporter, Wensley said that her compatriots would be interested.

Industry department officials are optimistic about the Australians outsourcing their diamond cutting and gold jewellery work to local artisans. Bhattacharjee also focused on the import of leather, marine products and fruits from the state.

In education, the high commissioner pointed out that although there are more than 10,000 Indian students in Australia, very few are from west Bengal.

6,State govt gets notice on diversion of SC fund,"HYDERABAD: A division bench of the AP High Court on Tuesday ordered issue of notice to the state government on a public interest writ petition complaining of large-scale diversion of funds earmarked for the development of the Scheduled Castes in the state.

The bench comprised Chief Justice Devender Gupta and Justice G Rohini.

M Victor Prasad, an advocate from Machlipatnam, had complained that the AP Scheduled Caste Cooperative Federation was expending huge sums allotted to it for paying salaries to its engineering staff. For instance, Rs 3 crore was released out of an outlay of Rs 10 crore for the year for Krishna district and over Rs 1 crore of the released fund was spent on salaries, he said. In Hyderabad too, a half of the released sum of nearly Rs 2 crore was spent on salaries.

The petitioner said that spending such huge amounts on salaries affected the development activities of the Scheduled Castes in the state.

Sentenced for murder The III Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge convicted Syed Abdul Azeez alias Azeez, Dheerendra Jha, Santosh Lakshman Rao, Kishanlal Saini alias Krishna and Syed Kaleem alias Munna alias Naresh Suresh Bhor of killing Haricharan Agarwal and sentenced them to six-year imprisonment and a penalty of Rs 200 each in a case of murder for gain and under the Arms Act.

According to the prosecution, Manitha Agarwal, daughter of Haricharan, lodged a complaint on July 25, 1998, stating that on the night of July 24, 1998, four persons entered into their house, threatened her father and inmates at knife-point and wanted the keys of a bureau. When Haricharan resisted and refused to hand over the keys, the accused fired at him and looted the house. Haricharan died of injuries.

7,All steps to protect Biharis: Assam govt,"PATNA: The Assam government claimed that it has taken all possible measures to safeguard the life and property of Biharis living or travelling by train or other modes of transport in Assam.

Assam chief secretary J P Rajkhowa, in a three-page letter to his Bihar counterpart K A H Subramanian on Wednesday, said his government has ordered for suspension of the officers in charge of the Bishwanath Chari and Dispur police stations for dereliction of duty. Assam has requested the Centre to send 30 additional companies of Central paramilitary forces. A copy of the letter has been forwarded to Union home secretary N Gopalaswamy for necessary action.

The letter says the Assam police have arrested 121 miscreants and booked them in 17 criminal cases in different parts of the state. Four miscreants were involved in arson cases. Fifty-seven persons were arrested at Titabor in Jorhat district. Strict instructions have been issued to the DMs and SPs of all districts to safeguard the life and property of Biharis. At Titabor, where there was trouble due to the rumour of rape of an Assamese girl by some Biharis, the police intervened timely and dispersed the mob by resorting to lathicharge and even firing. The Assam government has also instructed the DMs and SPs to deal with any incident of communal nature, especially the one involving Biharis, with a very firm hand. Stern disciplinary and other action will be taken against any official found to be neglecting his duty, the letter maintains.

On the other hand, Bihar is inundated with complaints and frantic messages from Biharis residing in various parts of Assam, notably Guwahati, Dibrugarh and Naogong, about assaults on them and burning of their property.

In his letter to Rajkhowa on Tuesday, Subramanian had said: â€œWe are trying our best to assure the people that the Assam government will take adequate steps to safeguard the life and property of Biharis. Unless some concrete reciprocal steps are taken to provide protection to Biharis in Assam and other North-Eastern states, the anxiety of the relatives of such Biharis residing in other states and the obvious chagrin at one-sided action are likely to trigger strong sentimental reactions,â€� Subramanian maintained.

Rajkhowaâ€™s letter says the Assam chief minister held a meeting with the leaders of other parties and the editors of all leading newspapers of the state and asked for their fullest cooperation in maintaining social harmony at all costs. On Tuesday, the CM held his third meeting with the leading citizens of Guwahati, including the representatives of Bihari community. The Assam government would appreciate if similar reciprocal steps are taken by the Bihar government to ensure that no Assamese or other persons, including students from Assam living in Bihar, are harassed, humiliated or attacked in any manner, the letter adds.

10,Chiranjeevi not smitten by politics,"HYDERABAD: ""As an actor I am everybodyâ€™s darling. How can a political post add to my charisma?"" Mega Star Chiranjeevi says nonchalantly to queries about joining politics.

Ever since he met chief minister Chandrababu Naidu last week, there has been speculation about his political moves. The actor has already clarified that at this juncture, politics was not on his mind.

Then what is? Heâ€™s got more plans in tinseltown. ""There are some interests that I want to pursue in films. For instance, Iâ€™d like to direct a film,"" he says. His next film Anji is set for release soon.

In an interview with The Times of India on Wednesday, Chiranjeevi said he still enjoyed the adulation of the people. ""No political position can give me that kind of a high,"" he said.

Had he not expected that there would be speculation if he met Chandrababu Naidu just when the election season was beginning? ""I least expected that because just a day before that I had made it clear in a statement that I was not interested in politics,"" he said.

Chiranjeevi said he has known Chandrababu Naidu for more than 15 years; their families share a long-standing association. ""Merely meeting him should not have set rumours flying thick and fast,"" he said.

The actor admitted that his fans were keen that he join politics but he would not be swayed by that. ""Iâ€™m not tempted,"" was his cryptic reply when asked if even a thought of politics had ever crossed his mind.

""I cannot jump into politics merely because people want me to. I should have a strong enough reason to. I should be able to answer why I feel the need to join politics,"" the actor said.

Asked if he was irritated about the obsession of his fans that he should jump onto the political bandwagon, Chiranjeevi said: ""Iâ€™m not irritated. I understand that such advice comes from their love for me.""

Chiranjeeviâ€™s last two films Indra and Tagore have been huge hits. While Indra was about faction feuds in Rayalaseema, Tagore was about corruption.

Since both subjects are real-life social issues, it fuelled the speculation further.

""Those who still think like that should change their perception and not attempt to change my livelihood,"" he quipped.

15,Youth's killing sparks protest in Srinagar,"SRINAGAR: Thousands of people on Thursday disrupted traffic and raised anti-government slogans in Ganderbal area, protesting the killing of a local allegedly by the security forces on Tuesday evening.

On Wednesday, the protestors put the body of the deceased youth on the main road and blocked the traffic for many hours. They were demanding action against the forces who allegedly killed the youth.

16,Judeo was never chief ministerial candidate: Swami,"RANCHI: Union Minister of State for Home I D Swami on Thursday said BJP had never projected former minister of state for forest and environment Dilip Singh Judeo as Chhattisgarh chief ministerial candidate and the video cassette showing the bribery footage was doctored for political gains.

""He (Judeo) was never projected as the chief ministerial candidate,"" Swami retorted when he was asked whether Judeo was still the party''s choice for the post.

""But Judeo will continue to campaign for the party in the ensuing Assembly elections,"" he said and alleged that the bribery allegations were doctored to hatch a conspiracy before the polls.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s decision to immediately accept Judeo''s resignation and his ordering CBI probe into the episode, though merely based on allegations, showed the party''s belief in value-based politics, Swami said.

Asked to comment on former BJP president Bangaru Laxman''s recent statement ''Don''t do a Bangaru Laxman to Dilip Singh Judeo'', he said, ""we never act in haste ... That is why we have asked for an inquiry.""

17,Bollywood rules the Afghan roost,"KABUL: His only ambition in life is to meet Bollywood queen Ash and he is extremely saddened to hear that Karishma Kapoor did not marry Abhishek Bachchan. Bashir is one of the millions of youths in war-ravaged Afghanistan, for whom the Mumbai tinsel town offers an escape from the harsh realities of death and destruction all around. Though the US led coalition forces hold military control over most of the Central Asian nation, it is India''s film and music industry that rules the minds and hearts of the battled hardened Afghans. Whether it is the ubiquitous yellow coloured Toyota Corolla taxis or the Bamiyan brassere restaurant at the plush Intercontinental hotel, Hindi film music holds the sway everywhere. Switch on the television, and you find a host of Indian channels dishing out popular numbers. At the heavily fortified Gulkhana Palace complex, home to King Zahir Shah and President Hamid Karzai, one of the Afghan commandos was more concerned over the high tarrif of an Indian movie pay channel than frisking the guests.

Most cinema halls in Kabul show Hindi movies, though the viewers are not able to read the posters written in Devnagiri script.



Even Indian Ambassador to Afghanistan, Vivek Katju admitted that Hindi film and classical music CDs, mostly pirated versions from Pakistan and cheaper than the Indian originals, were abundantly available on the streets of Kabul. ""Infact, there is a strong Indian classical music tradition, particularly the Patiala gharana, in Afghanistan,"" says Katju.



Whether at the Kabul International Airport or city restaurants, officials and waiters, mob Indian visitors asking them about Amitabh Bachchan, Salman, Shah Rukh and Amir Khans.



Infact, Indian passengers said, customs officials at the airport ask them more about film stars than the mandatory questions asked at airports. Besides friendly age-old ties with India, another reason for popularity of Indian films is the knowledge of Urdu among a large section of Afghans, who have spent years as refugees in neighbouring Pakistan where too Bollywood films and music are a big hit.



The craze for Bollywood is not confined to the younger generation alone.

19,Amarinder used state plane for polls: BJP,"BHOPAL: Two days after the Election Commission issued a show-cause notice to the Congress for violating the code of conduct by using the Chhattisgarh state aircraft for campaign, the BJP has approached the EC alleging Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh used his state aircraft to campaign for his party in Madhya Pradesh.

Singh allegedly used the Punjab governmentâ€™s plane during his two days of election campaign for Congress candidates.

The BJP claimed it has a video tape and records from airports as evidence. It alleged Singh also addressed election meetings at gurdwaras including one in Shivpuri town. The BJP appealed to the EC to â€˜â€˜derecognise the Congressâ€™â€™.

According to the BJPâ€™s complaint letter to EC, the Punjab chief minister was in Madhya Pradesh between November 15 and 17 to campaign for Congress candidates. He visited Indore, Jabalpur, Bhopal and Gwalior district by using his governmentâ€™s plane.

â€˜â€˜On November 16 morning, Amarinder reached Bhopal in the plane and participated in a programme organised by a gurdwara,â€™â€™ the BJPâ€™s letter said. â€˜â€˜He left in the same aircraft for Jabalpur where he campaigned for the Congress in a gurdwara. On November 17, he used the same aircraft to campaign in the Gwalior region. He also campaigned for the Congress in Shivpuri, Dabra and Gohad and addressed public meetings by using the same plane,â€™â€™ it said.

â€˜â€˜Not only he violated the code of conduct by using the state plane, he also used places of worship for electoral purpose. This too is violation of the code of conduct,â€™â€™ the BJP alleged.

20,Videography to keep a tab on election expenses,"NEW DELHI: Candidates beware, big brotherâ€™s watching you. In order to strictly enforce poll expenditure limits, the chief electoral office for Delhi has hired one vidoegrapher for each constituency to film the campaigning exercise.

According to the CEO, Arun Goyal, this is as per the EC guidelines on supervising electoral spending. â€˜â€˜We have one videographer on stand by in each constituency, to keep an eye not just on expenditure but also on possible violence,â€™â€™ he says.

According to sources, the CEO will be spending Rs 34 lakh on the exercise whereas the ceiling is of Rs 1 crore. The videographing will continue till the day of counting, December 4.

The returning officers in each area will be watching the tapes as and when any complaint will be received with regard to a particular candidate. The videographers hired for the occassion will have to provide for the tapes and other expenses themselves. Goyal did not specify how much each videographer would be paid.

According to sources, the large number of vehicles in every candidateâ€™s motorcade at the time of filing of nominations has alarmed the CEO. â€˜â€˜There are frequent scuffles and fights between supporters of rival candidates which is against the model code of conduct,â€™â€™ said an official at the election office.

Despite the EC having raised the ceiling on poll expenditure to 10 lakh, the videographing points out that campaign expenditure is still a problem.

21,Stress-busters to beat election blues,"NEW DELHI: Campaigning has reached a hectic pitch with barely 10 days to go before the assembly poll on December 1.

Most contestants are devoting 12 hours daily to padyatras. Late night meetings with party workers and unending phone calls leave them with just a few hours to sleep.

â€˜â€˜For us, public response is the vitamin and the adulation from supporters acts as a pain-killer,â€™â€™ said Congress candidate from Hastsal and sitting MLA Mukesh Sharma.

But that does not suffice for many, who are resorting to stress-busters to keep off the pre-poll blues.

Strict diets comprising papaya, milk and juices, brief sessions of yoga and meditation before setting out in the morning and a quick afternoon nap give them enough steam to keep going. The Delhi BJP chief and chief ministerial candidate trusts home-cooked, vegetarian food, and never misses his yoga session. An early riser, Khurana performs asanas to fight stress. His Congress counterpart, Sheila Dikshit, too, prefers routine exercises and a strict diet to beat the stress.

While Congress candidate from Malviya Nagar, Yoganand Shastri, starts his day with a havan, prefers satvik food and survives the day mostly on fruits and milk, his BJP rival Monika Aroraâ€™s campaign slogan is â€” health, hygiene and happiness.

â€˜â€˜Monika is a fitness freak, who meditates and practices yoga regularly. She prefers a low-fat diet,â€™â€™ said Bharat Bhushan, Aroraâ€™s husband. Mukesh Sharma claims his body is powered by the papaya that he eats in the morning and the milk he drinks at night.

Congress candidate from Mangolpuri, Raj Kumar Chauhan says, â€˜â€˜I hit the bed at 10.30 pm sharp. I walk almost 10 km every day. Proper sleep is a real stress-buster,â€™â€™ he added.

But BJP candidate from Hauz Khas, Aarti Mehra, is sleeping for barely four hours a day and is down with throat infection. â€˜â€˜I carry my antibiotics, inhale steam and take vitamins regularly,â€™â€™ she said.

For Ballimaran sitting MLA, Haroon Yusuf, campaigning during Ramzan means no consumption of food and liquid outdoor. â€˜â€˜Campaigning is like a ritual preceding elections. None can avoid or complain about it. I do brisk walking for 30 minutes before setting out to meet voters,â€™â€™ Yusuf said.

23,Teachers protest against poll duty,"VADODARA: The Vadodara City Primary Education Sangh submitted a memorandum to the collector and district election officer on Thursday protesting against employing teachers of municipal schools for election duty and urging a review of the decision.

Demanding that a vacation be declared for primary teachers given election duty between November 17 till December 8, the sangh said helping update the electoral rolls would hamper academic session, as teachers have been asked to go on a door-to-door campaign.

According to the sangh, education would suffer in nearly 124 schools of the city if teachers are asked to teach and simultaneously perform election duty. Teachers from nearly 40 schools handed over a memorandum to the collector on Thursday saying it would be the responsibility of the district education officer (DEO) if academics are affected.

Urging a review in the number of teachers employed for election duty, the sangh said only 25 per cent of the 1200-odd teachers should be appointed for election duty. President of Vadodara City Primary Education Sangh Sanatkumar H Pandya said, â€œThe collectorate has already asked 900 teachers to carry out election duty and have released the names of another 260 teachers. All teachers are from municipal schools while teachers from private schools have not been considered. They should take a note of this and review the decision.â€�

District education officer K M Varsat was unavailable for comment. However, the president of city primary education committee Rajendra Trivedi said, â€œI had anticipated this and had written to the authorities to review their decision. Considering the fact that education in all municipal schools would be hit, they should have employed some government servants as well.â€�
