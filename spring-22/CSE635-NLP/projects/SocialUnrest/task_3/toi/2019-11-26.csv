0,Tackling rebels: BJP hires lawyer for the job,"LUCKNOW: BJP legislature party leader Lalji Tandon will press the point that all the 10 BJP dissidents against whom he had filed a petition seeking their disqualification had quit the party by their action and behaviour.

Tandon will file a detailed reply on Tuesday to the objections filed by dissidents facing disqualification petition. The BJP has hired the services of a prominent lawyer, Satyapal Jain, to ensure that the petition was maintainable and action against the 10 rebel MLAs was taken.

The BJP had filed the petition on November 11 seeking disqualification of the 10 rebel BJP MLAs who had proposed the name of arms dealer Suresh Nanda for his nomination to Rajya Sabha. Speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi had issued notices fixing November 20 as the deadline for filing any objections. On objections filed by BJP and BSP rebels, the speaker had sought replies from Tandon and BSP leader and chief minister Miss Mayawati on her petition for termination of membership of a party rebel MLA Jai Prakash Yadav.

Quoting different judgments, including the recent Maharashtra High Court verdict, Tandonâ€™s argument will be that even if these rebels did not give in writing about their leaving the party, their actions and behaviour were anti-party and tantamount to leaving the party on their own. Tandon would produce more material evidences to prove his allegation.

Significantly, Tandonâ€™s reply will coincide with the debate on Uttar Pradesh in parliament on Tuesday. The reply assumes importance as it will form the basis for speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi to decide the maintainability issue on November 30.

In his reply, Tandon is likely to lay emphasis on rebels had raised a parallel organisation, BJP Bachao Samiti, and were working against the interests of the party under its banner. To highlight that rebels openly defied partyâ€™s senior leaders, the reply will quote from president Vinay Katiyarâ€™s warning letter dated November 7 that the party had put up its candidate and no party MLA would support candidature of any other candidate. The reply will highlight how rebels ignored the warning in open defiance.

The reply will also take strong note of rebelsâ€™ remarks against the party central leadership and the Delhi Panchayat on Friday to review the rebellion in the partyâ€™s state unit.

1,CM’s politics of convenience,"LUCKNOW: Blatant politics of convenience once again came to the fore in the state when chief minister Mayawati shook hands with the ousted Samajwadi Party members of parliament Ramakant Yadav and Balchand Yadav.

While on the one hand, the CM has cracked a whip against dissident MLAs and ensured police action against them, the â€œwelcomeâ€� to the two MPs, who have criminal records and had been expelled from the SP for their nefarious dealings had left many an eyebrow raised.

SP state president Ram Saran Das on Monday said that though the two had contested the parliamentary elections on SP tickets, their conduct saw them out of the party over a year ago. â€œThey have over a dozen cases each of land grabbing and other heinous crimes lodged against them,â€� the state SP chief said.

On the other hand, barely 24 hours ago the state government had ensured arrest of an independent MLA from Bihar assembly constituency Ram Nath Saroj and an independent MLC Gopal Bhaiyya by the Pratapgarh police on Sunday. The two had launched an agitation under the banner of Raja Bhaiyya Bachao Sangharsh Samiti and staged a protest at the state capital when the police team from Pratapgarh swooped down to arrest them.

Gopal was arrested in connection with a Gangsterâ€™s Act case lodged against Raghuraj Pratap Singh where the former had been named as a gang member. Saroj was arrested on charges of house-grabbing and dacoity in a criminal case lodged with the Pratapgarh police by a woman.

Earlier, too, while dissident-turned-loyalist Puran Singh Bundela was not only awarded an abhaydaan for the Rs 2 crore recovery of the Forest Department and from a criminal case lodged by no less than a forest ranger, BSP rebel JP Yadav from Gorakhpur is on his toes as police has been hunting for him barely hours after he met the governor to explain his disassociation from Mayawati and her party.

Similar combinations emerged when expelled Congress MLA from Rae Bareli Akhilesh Singh, who was recently granted bail in a murder case, was spared from the National Security Act as he joined the governmentâ€™s bandwagon. Preceding Akhilesh was Mukhtar Ansari who had to flee from the state fearing a backlash from Mayawati days before she came to power.

The equations changed and Mukhtar, after being arrested, was given relief from the NSA after the Act was slapped on him. Not surprisingly, recently in a written statement from the jail, Mukhtar extended support to Mayawati government and is now conveniently admitted at the CSMM College in police custody.

Vijay Singh and his wife being spared of the Gangsterâ€™s Act for his enmity with dissident MLC Ajit Singh, action against MLAs Raghuraj Pratap Singh and Dhananjay Singh for daring to raise their voice against the government have been some regularly quoted examples of how the administrative machinery is being used to ensure that the government remains firmly in the saddle.

2,A fortnight to protest violence in all forms against women,"KOLKATA: â€œMaybe she asked for it,â€� screamed the poster. Beneath it, is a black and white picture of a four-yearold girl. The fine print read, â€œOf about 12 million females raped each year, over 3 million are below the age of 11.â€�

This poster was one among the 100-odd displayed at the Park Circus Maidan at the exhibition, Half the sky, organised by Swayam, an NGO working for womenâ€™s rights. It was part of the campaign for the international fortnight protesting violence against women that began on Monday. Swayam is also helping rights groups in the North-East commemorate the event with posters and communication material.

â€œThis is the first year that we have tied up with the North-East Network which is working in four states in the region,â€� said a Swayam official.

Besides the exhibition, Swayamâ€™s theatre group performed a street play on sexual abuse of domestic workers. The play ended on the question of where the raped girl could go, who she could turn to. Bol, a documentary on domestic violence was also screened.

A series of workshops, films, rallies, interactive sessions with school teachers and students to increase awareness about domestic violence and sexual abuse are on the agenda. Both the play and the exhibition will travel to other places.

The fortnight begins every year on November 25, the day the three sisters were killed in Columbia while protesting against the military regime and ends with the World Human Rights Day on December 10.

On November 30, there will be a concert by school bands. The film festival on womenâ€™s issues will be inaugurated on December 2 with a dialogue between Aparna Sen and Sohag Sen. Konkona Sen Sharma would also hold a story-sharing session â€” That Takes Ovaries â€” when bold women will narrate their experiences at the Seagull media centre on December 6.

A rally on wheels will be held on December 8. The fortnight ends with a rally on December 10. About 40 NGOs working with women and children would march for womenâ€™s rights under the Maitree umbrella.

3,President to open sixth world Jesuit congress,"KOLKATA: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will inaugurate the sixth World Congress of Jesuit Alumni in Kolkata on January 21, 2003.

Disclosing this on Monday, spokesperson for the organising committee of the congress, Father P.C. Matthew said, â€œDr Kalam has given us his consent that he would inaugurate the four-day meet from January 21 through January 24.â€� He added that although the venue for the event is St Xavierâ€™s College, there is a possibility that it might be changed later. The event, called the Summit of Joy, has been further enhanced by the fact that Kolkata won the pitch to host the congress from among several other Asian cities in the fray.

â€œThe last congress was held in 1997 at Sydney and the onus was on Asia to hold it this year. Once the venue was narrowed down to India, the Sydney congress chose the city as the venue in response to a joint pitch offered by the three Jesuit alumni associations of Kolkata â€” the St Xavierâ€™s School Old Boys Association, St Xavierâ€™s College Kolkata Alumni Association and the St Lawrence Old Boysâ€™ Association,â€� Father Mathew said.

The Summit of Joy will be co-hosted by the three alumni associations, all of which are members of the Federation of Jesuit Alumni Associations of India (JAAI), which in turn represents India at the World Union of Jesuit Alumni. Incidentally, Dr Kalam is an alumnus of St Josephâ€™s College, Trichy, which is a member of JAAI. While around 700 delegates from around the country and abroad are expected to attend the congress, the meet is being projected as an opportunity to bring together the Jesuit alumni from around the world â€œso that they can integrate their efforts in working with people, who require help, to live with dignity and respect.â€�

The congress is expected to provide forum for intense discussions and to provide a direction to the delegates for being agents of social change. There would be sessions dedicated to discussions on opportunities for education, environment, corporate responsibility and empowerment of women.

Extensive arrangements are being worked out to welcome delegates â€” from opening desks at the airport and railway stations to local transportation and lodging facilities. Programme details are available on www.jawcon.org.

4,Chaos in court as Siliguri lawyers split over stir,"SILIGURI: The Siliguri Bar Association members were on Monday divided over the extension of lawyersâ€™ ceasework against hike in court fees in West Bengal sparking off tension at the court compound.

Chaos prevailed in the court compound with the pro and anti ceasework lawyersâ€™ groups taking out processions, holding press conferences and even using microphones inside the premises.

Pro-Left Democratic Lawyersâ€™ Association (DLA), which had announced that its members would resume work on Monday, claimed they were prevented from entering the court compound by majority group West Bengal State Bar Council (WBSBC).

DLA convenor in north Bengal Milan Sarkar said the WBSBC decision to extend the lawyers ceasework to December 3 was â€œillegal and unconstitutionalâ€� as no association or agency in the country had the right to stop the functioning of a court in providing justice to litigants.

The ceasework extension was an â€œimpatient, unjustified and irresponsible decision,â€� specially when the winter session of the state Assembly was due on December 12, and law minister Nishit Adhikari had assured a discussion on the issue in the house, he said.

The situation in Siliguri court was different as three courts in the hills of Darjeeling district would soon be closed for winter vacation. Therefore rush of litigants in the court was high and situation demanded the court functioned, he said.

In Kolkata, the Left Front government gave no indication of withdrawing the ordinance increasing court fees, even as the state-wide strike by lawyers to protest it entered the 13th day.

Attaching no importance to the agitation by lawyers, law minister Nisith Adhikary told the state secretariat that all courts in the state remained open.

â€œDuring the period of lawyersâ€™ceasework as many as 10,000 cases were filed in different courts in the state,â€� he said, adding that the people could fight their own cases without the help of lawyers.

The West Bengal Bar Council, spearheading the agitation, met Assembly Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim during the day and briefed him on their ceasework.

Emerging out of the meeting with Halim, Bar Council chairman Amiya Kumar Chatterjee said that they discussed the problems arising out of the ceasework and also briefed him on ''non-cooperation'' by the government.

Meanwhile, the prime accused in the Partha Roy Burman kidnap case Aftab Ansari could not be produced in court because of the ceasework.

5,Engg students ‘let down’ by Jharkhand govt,"JAMSHEDPUR: The career of 225 students who have cleared the 2002 joint engineering entrance examination appears to be in jeopardy because of the alleged criminal neglect of the Jharkhand government.The students from different parts of the state have hitherto been unable to secure admission in the 17 regional engineering colleges (REC) of the country, despite successfully competing in the state-level test.The reason is said to be the failure of Jharkhand Combined Entrance Competition Examination Board to hold counselling to allocate successful candidates to different RECs, which are ranked after the IITs. The process is yet to start in Jharkhand, even though the admission in RECs all over the country is over.The acting principal of the Adityapur-based Regional Institute of Technology (RIT), Dr A Mishra, confirmed the human resource department of the Union government this month instructed all RECs not to allow admissions any longer. The RECs work under the human resource department.For the students, the better the result, more serious is the trouble. The order effectively seals the fate of 85 students chosen for RECs outside Jharkhand. The first year students of some of the RECs would be taking the first semester exams in December. These 85 students will lose a year, even if admission is granted, RIT teachers said. No college will disturb its academic calendar or run special classes for a handful of students. The fate of 140 students of Jharkhand selected for the RIT, too, hangs in balance. The classes for the first year students start on Tuesday. The students from other states already have jointed the institute.The examination board set up by the government remains oblivious of the grim reality. When contacted at Ranchi on Monday, Shailesh Kumar of the board argued counselling was delayed because the admission process has not been completed. Reminded that the state-level counselling has to be conducted before the admission, Kumar said only the controller Mahabir Prasad could comment on the matter; but refused to give Prasad's telephone numbers.The RIT authorities reportedly sent repeated reminders to the board to complete counselling for the students. It's a case of criminal neglect. The board did not even bother to start the counselling even after the HRD department extended the deadline to September 30, informed sources said.The board apparently delayed counselling because the government's reservation had not been finalised. It failed to act even after the high court gave its ruling on the issue in August. The state cabinet had reworked the new quota for different categories of beneficiaries on September 20.Interestingly, the Jharkhand government's reservation as well as domicile policy cannot be applied on RECs outside the state. The reservation for ST and SC in the RECs has been fixed at 7.5 and 15 per cent respectively. There was no reason for delaying the counselling for the 85 students selected for colleges outside the state.

6,PAG’s stand exposes govt functioning,"PATNA: The controversy over the whereabouts of a Rs 2-crore Central fund released to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here on September 21, 2001, took a new turn on Monday with the principal accountant general (PAG), Ranchi, S K F Kujur, declaring that the RBI had credited the amount to the Bihar government account on October 3, 2001.

Kujurâ€™s statement has exposed the state finance departmentâ€™s functioning. It informed medical education secretary Afzal Amanullah on Oct 31 last that the fund had not been credited to the Bihar government account.

Interestingly, the finance department claimed that it had looked into the transfer of Central funds to the state government account during September and October, 2001. The finance department, however, did not bother to ascertain the facts from the PAG itself and instead asked Amanullah to send an officer to Ranchi to take up the matter with him.

Talking to TNN on telephone from Ranchi on Monday, Kujur said the RBI had credited the amount to the Bihar government account under memo no. 2/October 3, 2001 following an advice from the Union health ministry and had informed his office accordingly.

Kujur said the accountant generalâ€™s office, which compiles the Bihar governmentâ€™s monthly account, had put the Central fund in its account in October 2001. The AG (accounts), Patna, Rakesh Kumar Verma, also told TNN that the fund had been credited to the Bihar government account on October 3, 2001.

When contacted, state finance commissioner U N Panjiyar said he would look into the matter. A senior official of the department, however, said that the PAGâ€™s statement has put an end to the controversy over the Central grant-in-aid to the IGIMS for purchasing a linear accelerator needed for treatment of cancer patients. â€œJab PAG kah rahe hain to thik hi hoga,â€� he said. He, however, maintained that the RBI, while crediting the amount to the Bihar government account, might not have mentioned the specific head under which the Union health ministry had released the fund to the IGIMS and hence, the finance department failed to locate the same.

But the PAG said he had also received a copy of the sanction letter which stated the purpose for which the Centre had released the fund to the IGIMS. Medical education department sources said the sanction letterâ€™s copies were sent to the finance and medical education departments.

The medical education department had swung into action when on May 28 the IGIMS authorities sought its help to get the Central fund. Amanullah had also sought to know the whereabouts of the fund from the Union health ministry. The ministry had sent the sanction letterâ€™s copy to the department concerned last month, reiterating that it had released the fund to the finance department directing the department to transfer the fund to the IGIMS soon.

7,ML congress urges Left to unite,"PATNA: â€œUnite we must, and unite we shallâ€� was the refrain at the seventh congress of the CPI-ML (Liberation), which renewed its commitment to this and made a fervent appeal to all sections of the Indian Left â€œto respond to this need of the hourâ€� and rise to the occasion.

Inaugurating the five-day party congress here at the open-air theatre of the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir on Monday afternoon, party supremo Dipankar Bhattacharya said : â€œWe revolutionary communists have a different idiom. We uphold our right to self-defence under all circumstances, but we do not believe in political killings.â€�

In his 45-minute speech, Bhattacharya forcefully maintained: â€œRevolution for us is an epic; it is a genuine and protracted peopleâ€™s war directed against the most brutal and reactionary enemies of the people. Revolution for us is the biggest festival of the masses, a celebration and triumph of life over the morbid culture of death. We will continue to live and die for revolution.â€�

The Patna congress, he said, is dedicated to this great task of strengthening the â€œBihar model of red resistanceâ€� and spreading it all over India to combat and eliminate the â€œgrowing threat of fascist subversionâ€�.

Talking about the revolutionary movement in Bihar, he said it is no longer confined to the villages of Bhojpur and Patna. From Siwan and Champaran and Nalanda and Nawada, it has now spread to almost every corner of the state. â€œThis is why when Gujarat burns, the people of Bhojpur have no difficulty in recognising the fire. When the Modis and Togadias declare a war on Indiaâ€™s history of cultural plurality and threaten to turn India into a graveyard of democracy and secularism, we know that we have already seen their cohorts in action at Bathani Tola and Bathe,â€� Bhattacharya observed. â€œThis is why we invoke the Bihar model of red resistance to the Gujarat challenge of saffron subversion. The fascist threat to India is backed by an alliance of the ugliest elements of Indian history and society and the most obnoxious designs of global capitalism and US imperialism,â€� he said. The country is passing through a very critical phase. The December 6 will mark the tenth anniversary of that â€œmost disgraceful eventâ€� in the recent Indian history, the demolition of the Babri Masjid, which was the first alarming announcement of the â€œarrival of the fascist threat in Indiaâ€�, he said.

From Ayodhya to Ahmedabad, the threat has since covered considerable distance, he maintained.

The party supremo said the â€œsaffron brigadeâ€� today is displaying a new level of aggression, â€œthe AK-47 of the Vajpayee-Joshi-Advani vintageâ€� giving way to â€œthe AK-56 of the Modi-Togadia-Singhal varietyâ€�.

The Congress party can only think of offering some competition by hiring the services of â€œex-servicemenâ€� from the Sangh, he added.

The last decade, according to him, has shown clearly that enterprises of the RJD-SP-BSP variety, which once used to claim to be â€œwalking the third wayâ€�, have gone â€œabsolutely bankruptâ€�.

â€œThe time has come when the new generations of fighters for democracy and social justice must reject the blind alleys of bankruptcy and betrayal, corruption and criminalisation where the self-styled disciples of JP, Lohia and Ambedkar have led them,â€� he observed.

For the first time, the party on Monday honoured at least 21 veteran communist â€œrevolutionariesâ€� of Bihar by offering each of them an angvastram, book and party flag. The leader of the CPI-ML legislature party in Bihar, Ram Naresh Ram, honoured them in the open session. Prominent among them were: Jagannath Sarkar, P Gupta, Tara Kant Prakash, Ramakant Dwivedi, Sunderdeo Paswan and Nagia Devi.

In all, 21 foreign delegates belonging to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Australia, Nepal and Sri Lanka attended the open session.

8,Cong asks for inquiry into tourism minister’s activities,"HYDERABAD: The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) has demanded the government order an inquiry into alleged irregularities by tourism minister T Srinivas Yadav and his followers.

Addressing a press conference on Monday PCC general secretary Pitla Krishna alleged the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders were involved in land grabbing in the twin cities with the ""tacit support"" of Srinivas Yadav. Krishna wondered as to why the chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who talks about transparency, had no knowledge of the alleged land grabbing by the minister and his followers.

Krishna said that Srinivas Yadav and his followers were forcibly collecting mamools from vegetable vendors of Thai Bazar Secunderabad''s Monda market. The minister''s aides had already encroached a major part of the land under survey number 74/8 at Azad Chandrasekhar Nagar and sold it, he added.

The Congress leader said the brother of the minister was resorting to all sorts of irregularities in the execution of the weaker section housing scheme at Azad Chandrasekhar Nagar. Separate memorandums to the chief minister and the district collector Rajeswar Tiwari had already been submitted, he added. Srinivas Yadav

9,Gujarat polls a referendum on secularists: Togadia,"NEW DELHI: Declaring the Gujarat elections as a referendum on ""secular and anti-Hindu"" forces, the VHP on Tuesday rejected the Prime Minister''s appeal not to raise the Godhra issue and announced moblisation of five lakh cadres to turn the polls into ""Sonia Gandhi''s Waterloo.""

""The Gujarat elections would be a referendum against secular and anti-Hindu forces and VHP would be mobilising its total energy to turn it into a graveyard of pseudo-secularists and a Waterloo for Congress President Sonia Gandhi,"" VHP''s fire brand Secretary-General Praveen Togadia said in an interview here on Tuesday.

Togadia, who is on his first visit to the capital after his arrest following the ban on VHP''s Padpadshahi Yatra, categorically stated that the Sangh Parivar outfit would not campaign for or against ""any particular political party or individual"", including Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

""We will be holding public meetings across Gujarat to expose the gameplan of the secularists, who projected Hindus, the victims of Godhra, as the perpetrators. We will educate them about the difference in the treatment they meted out to the Kashmiri Pandit refugees vis-a-vis Muslims staying in camps,"" he said.

Outrightly rejecting Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s appeal to all organisations not to raise the Godhra issue in the run-up to the polls, he said, ""Godhra is as grave an insult to Hindus as the abduction of Sita or the attempt to disrobe Draupadi. It is a permanent issue for Hindus and we will continue to raise it.""

11,Centre formulating comprehensive civil aviation policy,"BANGALORE: The government is formulating a comprehensive civil aviation policy covering all sectors in the field, Civil Aviation Secretary K Roy Paul said on Tuesday.

The policy would emphasise the increasing role of private sector not only for bridging the ""gap in resources"" but also for achieving greater efficiency in management of aviation infrastructure, he said.

In his address to the EU-India Civil Aviation Cooperation summit, read out in absentia, Paul said tremendous increase in international trade and passenger traffic had revealed capacity gaps that affected all segments of the aviation-- airlines, passengers, exporters and importers, related services and industries.

Closing this gap, he said, would require an integrated sector policy, harmonisation of local, national and international legal and regulatory structures, and more money and better management.

Paul said to instil confidence in prospective investors and protect the interests of users, government proposed to have an Independent Airports Economic Regulatory Authority for the limited economic regulation of airports, particularly in the context of private airports.

On the domestic air traffic, he said in 2001-2002, due to the September 11 terrorist strikes on World Trade Center, it came down to 13 million but this year there were of recovery and it was poised for a healthy growth.

12,SP activists stage 'rasta roko' to protest tree-cutting,"MUMBAI: Activists of the Samajwadi Party SP) on Tuesday staged a rasta roko in Mankhurd where 720 trees were hacked allegedly to enhance the visibility of hoardings put up by S.B. Advertising. This is part of the SP''s campaign against tree-cutting by advertising hoarding agencies.

On Tuesday, youths led by president of the Samajwadi Yuvajan Sabha (SYS) Nasser Jamal tried to climb on the towering hoardings to blacken the advertisements. However, the Trombay police dragged the activists down and whisked them away to waiting police vans.

The activists then resorted to throwing stones on a hoarding, which was more than 25-feet high. Later, they blocked the traffic by staging a rasta roko for half-an-hour, though ambulances and a private car carrying a patient were allowed to pass.

On the night of November 10, 750 trees on the Central Railway land were hacked systematically along the length of the Mankhurd-Vashi highway.

S B Advertising had written to the Central Railway, complaining that the trees were blocking the view of the hoardings. The agency, however, denied any involvement in the chopping of trees.

A civic official told TNN that the agency pulled down all but one hoarding on Sunday. Central Railway had directed the ad agency to remove the hoardings as its lease contract had expired recently, its spokesperson said.

Last week, the BMC cancelled the agency''s permit for violating civic guidelines pertaining to hoardings. The hoardings were situated on railway land and were being blocked by a dense tree cover.

The BMC has also asked the rail authorities to remove the metal frames on which the hoardings stood. Sources said the hoardings were situated inside the mangrove zone and the same is prohibited by a recent high court order.

However, the police, who are yet to arrest the agency''s proprietors, said investigations were on.

Mr Jamal told TNN, ""I was hurt to find that the trees were mercilessly chopped or uprooted. I could have understood had they pruned the trees a little, but what they did was totally criminal.""

Last week, SYS activists ripped apart a huge hoarding which advertised a cellular phone service on Marine Drive. Three coconut trees were chopped. The next target was a hoarding in Crystal apartment at Kemps Corner where a peepal tree and rusty shield-bearer were chopped.

Mr Jamal said, ""The peepal tree is very sacred as Hindus believe that Lord Brahma lives in the tree. Besides, the tree also gives out lot of oxygen.""

Mr Jamal said he requested multi-national companies to avoid advertising their products through hoardings which violate civic guidelines and damage the environment.

13,State govt has been deceived: Former minister,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government had been deceived by M.L. Dalmiya & Co, the promoter of Calcutta Leather Complex, feels former minister and RSP leader Kshiti Goswami.

Shocked by the fact that the agreement between the state government and the Dalmiyas had fixed no deadline for project completion, Goswami wondered whether the government should at all have agreed to such a deal.

The veteran RSP leader also disagrees with the state industries minister Nirupam Senâ€™s claim that the minimum infrastructure required for the tanneries had already been set up and that the tanners should immediately shift to the new site.

â€œBright street lamps have been set up in the leather complex giving one the impression that it is ready for production. In reality, hardly anything has been done so far. I donâ€™t know how the industries minister made such a claim,â€� Goswami told TNN on Tuesday. He also felt that it had been criminal to have forced the tanners to move to the site where even the minimum infrastructure like power, and water required for production were not ready.

Asked why he did not object to the deal even though he was a cabinet minister in 1997, Goswami said that he had no knowledge of the nature of the agreement that was being concluded between the state government and the company. â€œWe had no knowledge of the details. These were being finalised at a much higher level,â€� he said.

The worried RSP leader said that his party would raise the issue during the Left Front meeting slated for December 2. â€œSomething has to be done. And it has to be done fast,â€� he said.

15,Slum clusters or nurseries for law-breakers,"NEW DELHI: The recent incident of rape of a Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) student involved two minors â€” aged 14. Both are from slum clusters.

The involvement of children from slums is no surprise for experts dealing with juvenile delinquency. Anupriya Chadha, a child psychologist, said: â€˜â€˜It has been found that the acceptable social behaviour of middle class society is not strictly adhered to in slums.

Hence, slum-dwellers are not rigid about such social ethics and norms.â€™â€™ Chadha said it all started at an early age.

â€˜â€˜The juveniles often have cognitive (learning) problems. Teachers and parents are not aware of these problems and punishments are the natural outcome. As a result, they do not complete their formal education and are mostly dropouts,â€™â€™ she said

And most of these offenders have a similar background. â€˜â€˜They come from broken homes, dysfunctional families, where fighting, abuse and alcohol are normal,â€™â€™ she said.

16,"One more rally, city comes to a halt","NEW DELHI: Whenever a rally or fair is organised in the city, traffic near the venues comes to a virtual halt. Motorists remain stranded for several hours.

While experts blame lack of scientific planning for the routine jams, police officials claim the woefully inadequate facilities are at the core of this problem.

Says Institute of Road Traffic Education chief Rohit Baluja: â€˜â€˜There is no scientific management of traffic in the city. Events like trade fairs and rallies, which mean assembly of large number of people and vehicles, should be tackled on the same footing as on Republic Day.â€™â€™ Baluja said the traffic police should use more technocrats and transport planners to plan traffic management during these occasions.

P K Sarkar of School of Planning and Architectureâ€™s transport planning department said the traffic conditions should be made known to commuters on a real-time basis. â€˜â€˜Suppose I were to go to south from north, I should get a real-time update of the traffic situation. Then I can plan my journey and not add to the traffic burden,,â€™â€™ he said.

Traffic officials say there is dearth of pedestrian facilities. â€˜â€˜Everyone who visits the fair is a pedestrian for some distance. But despite the crowd being predominantly pedestrian, there is just one subway at Bhairon Road,â€™â€™ says Arun Kampani, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi, traffic).

17,Comprehensive civil aviation policy on anvil,"BANGALORE: The Union government is formulating a comprehensive civil aviation policy which will soon come up before the cabinet.

The policy will cover all sectors, with a strong thrust for private investment and participation, Ministry of Civil Aviation Joint Secretary Anurag Goel said.

Delivering the address on behalf of Civil Aviation Secretary K. Roy Paul at the Aero Technologies Summit'' in Bangalore on Tuesday, he said: ""The government proposes to set up an â€˜independent airports economic regulatory authority'' to instill confidence in prospective investors and for limited economic regulation of airports particularly in the context of private airports.""

The last decade has seen aviation in the Asia-Pacific region grow by 7.9 per cent as compared to the world average of 4.8 per cent.

Despite global downturn and 9/11, the region would continue to lead growth at seven per cent per year till 2010.

India alone had seen a domestic traffic of 13 million in 2001-2002. The share of Indian operators in the 12 million international passenger traffic who travelled to and from India in 2001 is 30 per cent, said Goel. Both traffic had been hit by 9/11 but there are signs of recovery and the country is poised for healthy growth, he said.

According to ICAO estimates, long-term traffic forecast for India is predicted at seven per cent average growth per year. More domestic airports like Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Cochin, Goa, Amritsar and Guwahati are being declared as international airports to increase trade and tourism in the interiors.

""We are liberalising our policy for bilateral air traffic rights on a need-driven basis. For the peak tourist season between December 1 to March 31, a unilateral limited open sky has been announced for carriers of West Europe and USA to mount any number of services during this period,"" said Goel.

18,Walkout on law and order issue,"NEW DELHI: A discussion on the law and order situation in the city was reduced to mere politicking, marked by allegations and walkouts in the Delhi legislative assembly on Tuesday.

Impatience ruled high on the second day of the winter session and the opposition benches remained vacant for most of the time. Trouble started when Gandhi Nagar MLA Arvinder Singh Lovely spoke of how the Delhi police had been instructed to stay at the beck and call of the BJP leaders in the city.

He alleged top officers of the force met on October 2 and passed instructions that ACPs should stay in touch with all BJP leaders.

The opposition members made repeated references to the riots in 1984 and other highly publicised criminal cases involving Congress leaders, including the Naina Sahni case in 1995 and the recent Atma Ram Gupta murder.

BJP MLA Harsharan Singh Balli then raised objection to the deputy speaker Kiran Choudhury presiding over the assembly. His contention was that since she initiated the debate she would not be impartial.

Choudhury quoted the law and told him that no such rule existed. However, when Balli continued to shout and stomp about, he was asked to leave. Along with him the rest of the opposition also walked out.

Bedlam broke out for the second time when Lovely proposed the resolution and Maken stood up for a motion suspending a rule that forbade the passing of such a resolution. Once again the opposition walked out amid much shouting.

The resolution passed condemned the deteriorating law and order situation and the recent spurt in crime against women in the city. It also expressed concern over the alleged link that was being established between the BJP leaders and the police force.

Chief minister Sheila Dikshit spoke of a special police force for Delhi that would only look after the needs of the common people. â€˜â€˜The Delhi police has presented figures that indicate the overall crime rate of the city has fallen by 10 per cent over the past one year. Despite this there is a tremendous feeling of insecurity among people who hesitate to approach the police lest they are harassed,â€™â€™ she said.
