0,'New laws could help stub out cigarettes',"MUMBAI: The power-puff stars staring out of billboards always gave anti-tobacco activists the shivers. After all, it's not easy to resist the offer held out by brawny men lighting cigarettes after effortlessly skiing down snow-covered slopes or rescuing damsels in distress. But on 'No Tobacco Day' today, anti-tobacco activists are finally seeing some light filter in through the smokescreen. Laws on tobacco control that have come into force in India in the past year have made lighting up more difficult than ever. The Indian Parliament recently passed the Tobacco ControlAct, while the World Health Organisation (WHO) adopted the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in mid-May. The treaty is more in the form of a set of guidelines, but union health minister Sushma Swaraj pledged in Geneva to implement it in toto. The Indian law and Geneva treaty were pushed through after years of campaigning by activists, despite efforts to thwart the measures by the powerful tobacco manufacturers' lobby. In India, where there are an estimated nine lakh tobacco-related deaths every year, the strong measures will be a deterrent, say anti-tobacco activists. Till now, we didn't have anything to fall back on,'' said Shoba John,who represented Indian NGOs at the WHO convention at which the treaty was adopted. We were working on attitudinal changes, but this is a kind of tool that we have, a legal entitlement towards stopping smoking.'' The Indian act bans the advertisement of tobacco products and prohibits smoking in public places. The tobacco industry's best customers keep dying on them, so they are always looking for new people,'' said Dr K.S. Reddy of the Advocacy Forum for Tobacco Control, which has health professionals, scientists and NGOs as its members. The WHO treaty could also spell the end of all tobacco-related advertising and sponsorships, said Ms John. In fact, a recent World Bank study conducted across 102 countries over a 10-year period showed that nations with a comprehensive ban on advertising saw a steeper decline in tobacco use than others. But what many activists are pinning their hopes on is a clause in the treaty that says health warnings on cigarette packs should be blown up to occupy at least 30 per cent of the area on the packs. This has worked wonders in Canada, where packs with graphic images of tobacco-related diseases drastically affected consumption patterns. A study conducted by the Canadian Cancer Society, one year after the images were introduced on packs, showed that 58 per cent of the smokers interviewed were motivated to think about the health effects of smoking because of the images. Forty-four per cent said it increased their motivation to quit. It's still unclear when India will see similar cigarette packs and enforce the guidelines framed under the WHO treaty. Dr Surendra Shastri, head of the department of preventive oncology at Parel's Tata Memorial Hospital, pointed out, It's up to the signatory countries to draft rules and many may modify clauses in a manner that suits them.'' For India, statistics bear out why stubbing out cigarettes should be one of the country's prime concerns. According to WHO figures, 1.4 per cent of all deaths in India in 1990 were related to tobacco. If the current rate of tobacco consumption continues, by 2020 it could be 13.2 per cent,'' warned Dr Reddy.

1,"Do away with CRZ laws for city, urge builders","MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry wants the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) laws scrapped for Mumbai. The regulations, which came into force over a decade ago, aim to protect the environment by banning construction 500 metres from the coastline. But the chamber, which counts leading builders among its members, contends that the CRZ rules have hampered Mumbai's economic development. The CRZ law in 1991 was framed to preserve the natural and ecologically sensitive coastline areas and beaches. However, Mumbai is an island city surrounded on all three sides by sea with a limited land mass. Therefore, a rational, logical and practical approach needs to be adopted exclusively for this city while framing the CRZ policy,'' it said. CRZ regulations have locked up 30 per cent of developable land in the island city and 40 per cent in the suburbs, contended Sunil Mantri, the chamber's honorary secretary. This has led to an increase in slums on the coastline as well as in backwaters and rivers,'' he claimed. Therefore, there is no option left except to scrap CRZ rules for Mumbai.'' But environmentalist Debi Goenka said that abolishing the CRZ regulations would be disastrous for the city. CRZ is not hampering development but frustrating the money-making prospects of builders, who have no interest of the city anyway,'' he said. The city has already exceeded its carrying capacity several times over and cannot support any further growth, he said. CRZ has protected the few remaining open spaces around the coastline, which builders would have otherwise gobbled up,'' Mr Goenka added. A new government notification stipulates that reconstruction of any building valued at more than Rs 5 crores that falls in the CRZ has to be approved by the Centre. Reconstruction or demolition of buildings of archaeological or historical importance, places of worship, education, medical care, venues for cultural activities and heritage buildings all need central government clearance. Ajit Mathur, chairperson of the chamber's sub-committee, ministry of environment and forests, said that this new notification has proved detrimental to Mumbai's progress. The value of Rs 5 crores of a property as per the price index of construction cost in 1991 will be over Rs 14 crores today,'' he said. Further, the entire process of sending the files to the Centre will be too time-consuming.'' The restrictions had also hampered the implementation of the government's slum rehabilitation scheme on lands falling in the CRZ, he said. If slum schemes are allowed in CRZ areas ... then the projects would become more viable and the environment standard of various slums will improve,'' he added. Officials indicated that the state government has already recommended to the Centre that CRZ regulations be relaxed for redevelopment of slums and old tenanted buildings. Builders contend that the CRZ rules have hampered Mumbai's economic development. These rules have led to an increase in slums on the coastline as well as in backwaters and rivers, according to the builders

2,Ex-minister of Bihar jailed after surrender,"GAYA: Contrary to speculation about a Laloo-style processional surrender, former minister Surendra Prasad Yadav, an accused in the infamous custodial kidnapping case, surrendered in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) here on Friday morning. A prayer for bail was also moved by Surendra's lawyer Dhirendra Kumar Sinha. Rejecting the bail prayer, officiating CJM R P Thakur sent the former minister to the Gaya Central Jail. With the surrender, a seven-week game of hide and seek between the Gaya police and the RJD strongman has come to an end. Around 8 am on Friday, a Scorpio entered the Gaya court premises. As the vehicle stopped, Surendra along with some close associates walked to the CJM court and announced his surrender. Thereafter, his lawyer made a long argument seeking bail for the former minister. The lawyer argued that his client was innocent and that he has been falsely implicated in the criminal case. He also referred to the statement made by the custodial kidnapping case victim, Atul Prakash, in which Prakash has not named Surendra as his tormentor. It was also pleaded that Atul, has, in fact named policemen as his tormentors. After hearing the argument, the CJM rejected the bail petition and remanded the former minister to judicial custody. According to court sources, before leaving for jail, the former minister looked calm and made some calls from the cellular phone of one of his aides. He will again be produced in the court on June 6, 2003. Earlier on May 8, Gaya district and sessions judge Jawahar Lal Chaudhary, while rejecting the anticipatory bail petition of Surendra, observed that the former minister has tampered with evidence against him. The observation, according to legal experts, is likely to trouble Surendra in what promises to be an interesting and long-drawn legal battle. The district judge also favoured a CBI inquiry into the case.

3,Cable operators end strike after minister's word,"LUCKNOW: The strike of the cable operators had been started on the pretext that the Government gives just assurances. Ironically, it came to end after yet another assurance. Cable operators of the state on Friday evening decided to suspend their four-day strike after entertainment tax minister Hari Shankar Tiwari gave assurance that government will announce its entertainment tax policy for cable TV by July 15, 2003. The hapless consumer remained a mute spectator to all the drama as cable transmission started once again from late evening. These cable operators had barred telecast of all the entertainment channel to protest government's decision to impose 30 per cent entertainment tax and 8 per cent service tax. Their main contention was that the minister had assured them last year about imposition of Rs 10 per connection entertainment tax. They had also complained that every time when cable operator went on strike, government gave an assurance, thus they said that this time an 'ultimate battle' would be fought. Significantly, for last three days neither the chief minister and entertainment tax nor any competent officer was in the city who could negotiate with the operators. On Friday afternoon, the minister called a delegation of UP Cable TV Udyog Sangh for a dialogue. It was decided in the meeting that a committee comprising representatives of Udyog Sangh, consumers and the government, would be formed which will discuss and recommend regarding entertainment tax on cable TV in the state. On the basis of these recommendation, the government would come out with a entertainment tax policy by July 15 and till then during the month of June cable operators will deposit tax on the basis of 'self assessed' connectivity in place of the number of connection calculated by government agencies. Cable operators were also assured that recovery on the basis of government survey will be suspended for one month. Alok Parikh, spokesman, UP Cable TV Udyog Sangh, in a statement issued said that Sangh had decided to defer the strike till July 15, 2003 following assurances of the minister. He said that cable operators hope that this time minister's assurance will result in a positive solutions. He also warned cable consumers that they should also wake up and support operators in the struggle or else operators will not be able to continue the fight for long. Later in the evening, Government also formed a nine-member coordination committee. Additional commissioner entertainment tax would be the convener of the committee, Kanpur district magistrate or an officer nominated by him will be the representative of the government. There will be three members each nominated by the UP Cable TV Udyog Sangh and Cable Upbhokta Sewa Sanrakshan Samiti each in the committee.

4,Use new tech for development: Kalam,"HARNAUT (NALANDA): President Kalam said here on Friday that Bihar has a great potential for becoming a developed state. Inaugurating the Rs 98.4-crore project for setting up a railway coach maintenance workshop at Harnaut, Kalam said the state can be developed with the proper use of new technologies. In his 20-minute speech in English, he said the workshop would be one of the railways' great contributions to Bihar. The railways, according to Kalam, is one of the most important factors in maintaining the integrity of the country. Recalling his personal experience of train journey, he said during the 1950s when he travelled from Rameshwaram island to Chennai, from Chennai to Delhi and again from Delhi to Dehradun by train, he found that the railways were the only system which kept the unity of the people intact. Kalam hoped that the country would transform into a developed nation by 2020 and that the railways would be one of the major contributors to this end. The railways can greatly help in popularising the tourist and heritage sites in different parts of the country, he said. The President, dressed in biscuit colour prince suit, arrived at the venue of inaugural function by helicopter around 5.30 pm, half an hour behind the schedule. He formally inaugurated the project by pressing a button on the dais. He said: ""I can speak only in Tamil and English, and my friend Rajan will translate my speech into Bihari Hindi."" He began his speech by narrating the wonderful experience of meeting schoolchildren at Patna on Friday morning. ""I shared dreams and hopes with them. I then sang a song with them -- 'I am the child of Bihar. I was born in Bihar...'"" He lauded the contributions of Aryabhatta, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavira and Sikh Gurus -- all associated with Bihar. CM Rabri Devi thanked Kalam and railway minister Nitish Kumar for establishment of the workshop at Harnaut. She hoped that the project would be completed within the stipulated period. The CM said the Centre has failed to provide a special financial package to Bihar after its bifurcation. She urged Kalam to put Bihar in the special state category. The Centre should initiate a dialogue with Nepal for flood control, she added. While thanking Kalam for visiting Harnaut to inaugurate the project, Nitish said initially, the workshop would do repair and maintenance of 600 railway coaches a year, but it would soon be able to handle 2,000 coaches a year. With the project's execution within two years, Harnaut would be fully developed. It would have new employment opportunities for the local people.

6,Tech hub not outside bandh purview: Sen,"KOLKATA: Special economic zones and public utility services will not be beyond the purview of bandhs in West Bengal. The only thing they can bargain for is a prior notice and meeting of other legal stipulations, according to state industry minister Nirupam Sen. Wildcat strikes would not be acceptable in public utility services, said Sen. By that standard, the May 21 strike was observed after fulfilling all legal stipulations, he maintained. If traders and truckers' strikes were not detrimental to the state's and national interest, how can we snatch the workers' right to strike, argued Sen, justifying the May 21 bandh when the rest of the country observed an industrial strike. Desperate to woo invest-ors, Sen hinted that the state would declare more and more industries as public utility services. Briefing the media about the state's efforts in promoting investment over the last two years, Sen insisted that it was no less friendly to investors either. We are trying to create an industry-friendly ambience, he emphasised. Though there is threeand-a-half times growth, we are not complacent. We are trying hard to change investor perception of West Bengal and industry leaders like ITC and Wipro are happy with us, added Sen. While iron and steel continued to top the investment list, the government is exploring possibilities in biotech and floriculture and hoped to open gems and jewellery and toy parks sometime this year.

7,Staffer's arrest opens can of worms for temple,"NEW DELHI: Days after a Sai Baba temple employee was arrested for allegedly misappropriating funds, former employees and some trustees are coming out with details on the murkier side of the temple administration. According to the police, on May 24 temple accountant T P Singh tried to steal a bag containing Rs 66,000 which was part of the day's chadhawa (offering) to the deity. Confirming the incident, some trustees said Singh was asked by the priest to deposit the money in the bank. Singh put the money in four bags, but hid one of them in an almirah. A security guard, Ran Vijay, who was watching Singh raised an alarm. The trustees called up the police and got Singh arrested. Deputy commissioner of police (south), Vivek Gogia, said: ""A case under sections amounting to misappropriation of funds and breach of trust has been registered in Lodhi Colony police station."" The temple is visited by over 70,000 people every Thursday. The temple receives about Rs one crore in offerings every month. But the case has highlighted the sharp divisions within the trustees. ""The norms are being flouted openly and the office bearers are granting membership to their friends and kin who act as puppets,"" said R P Suneja, a former treasurer with the temple. Suneja resigned after a tiff with the temple authorities over a clarification he sought before signing a cheque. Suneja expressed surprise that only one office bearer was present when the money was being transferred. ""Four members have to be present there, including the joint secretary and the treasurer. A member has to accompany the temple employee to the bank. In this case, it did not happen,"" he said. Members said Singh had been working in the temple for five years and this might not have been the first offence. ""In the absence of proper audit, he might have been acting in collusion with other temple trustees,"" a temple trustee said. DCP Gogia said the police is investigating all angles and trying to ascertain if this was Singh's first offence.

8,BJP to go to polls as 'Shaktishali',"HYDERABAD: The BJP will fight the next Assembly and Lok Sabha polls on the slogan 'Shaktishali Bharat, shaktishali BJP' (powerful India, powerful BJP) and seek a more decisive mandate from the voters to put the country on par with the developed nations. The party, after a two-day brainstorming session of state unit presidents and national leaders, set out priorities and chalked out a 25-point agenda to achieve its Mission 2004. The BJP also wants to consolidate the party's support base in the country and directed its cadres to visit every house in every village to spread its message 'Desh bhar me BJP.' BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu, who briefed the media after the session on Friday, said good governance and development would be the party's poll issues. It will not rake up Hindutva, it was decided. Naidu said the party's message to the cadres to achieve Mission 2004 is: Think progressively, assert ideologically and campaign aggressively to win at least 300 Lok Sabha seats. Asked whether these manoeuvres were an indication of plans to advance the Lok Sabha elections, he said: We have no such plans. The two-day convention also came up with a five-point action plan outlining the party's strategy for the Assembly elections in four states scheduled later this year. Naidu said the plan includes steps to prevent 'scientific rigging' by the Congress and left parties. As part of the 25-point agenda, the BJP asked its state unit leaders to take out various 'yatras' to expose the governments where the party is in the opposition or highlight the development activities in BJP-ruled states. The party also asked its state units to set up offices in all district headquarters and directed the ministers and other senior leaders to visit them frequently. The BJP chief said the party would also launch a mass contact programme to reach out to every village.

9,'No law adopted on outsourcing yet',"PUNE: US Congressman Jay Inslee, a Democrat from Seattle, Washington, allayed fears of an impending US curb on business process outsourcing (BPO) to India. Inslee, who addressed members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in the city on Friday, said that while many Bills had been admitted in several state legislatures, nowhere had these Bills been passed and become law. ""Even in my state, there has been no substantial movement on the Bills,"" Inslee said. According to the Congressman, the last time the US had tried its hand at protectionism, it had ended in the Great Depression of 1929. ""Nobody wants to go back to the dark ages in my country,"" Inslee said. He even cited examples of how the US had not imposed trade restrictions on the entry of Japanese automobiles and electronic equipment. Fielding questions on the US-Pakistan relationship, Inslee said that the US administration was grappling with a difficult position in Pakistan. According to him, the US had to grapple simultaneously with a military dictatorship, the threat from terrorist groups in Afghanistan, the growth of terrorist pockets within Pakistan and the unresolved Kashmir dispute. ""India must understand the US role from this angle,"" Inslee said. He expressed the hope that more Indian Americans residing in the US would get involved in this debate in that country. When the issue of stringent visa formalities was raised by a CII member, Inslee said this was a result of the increased threat perception within the US. He, however, agreed that the manpower in the consular offices had to be beefed up. He also suggested the introduction of a 'frequent flyer programme' to make passage to the US simpler for businessmen. ""I promise to bring these issues up when I go home,"" Inslee said. Pradeep Rawat, city parliamentarian, who also attended the meeting, told Inslee that if the US wants to assume a leadership position, it needed to adopt a more holistic view against terrorism in the world. Referring to India's own fight against terrorism Rawat said, ""The US needs to recognise that there are several countries fighting terrorism and a uniform policy needs to be adopted to root out this problem."" Acknowledging Rawat's point of view, Inslee said, ""Terrorism cannot be fought by a strong military alone. My party has constantly been advising the Bush administration to engage in an increased dialogue and discussion at the international level.""

10,'Rear guard' action must for trucks,"PUNE: The ministry of road transport and highways has amended the central motor vehicle regulations, making it mandatory for heavy vehicles manufactured on or after May 1, 2003, to be fitted with an ""under-run protective device"" at the rear. The device — in the form on an iron grill or guard fitted 550 mm above the road level — would ensure that in the event of an accident, smaller vehicles coming from behind do not skid under the truck and get trapped. Such mishaps have proven fatal for two-wheeler riders. A copy of the amendment, carried out on December 27, 2002, was recently forwarded to the International Society for Road Transport and Safety (ISRTS), a Nagpur-based non-governmental organisation, which had pressed for it. Addressing a press conference here on Friday, ISRTS executive member Ajit Mandlekar and treasurer Vishwas Bagaddeo circulated a copy of the amendment. It states that the protective grill should be as per Indian Standards 14682 and 14812. The standards specify that the guards should be fitted on both sides, be made either of continuous flat sheet metal or rails and the lower edge of the side guard not be more than 550 mm above the ground. Mandlekar, however, alleged the state transport commissioner had not even circulated a copy of the amendment to all regional transport offices (RTO) in the state. He demanded that the orders should be effected with retrospective effect. ""If the authorities fail to enforce the amendment we will move court,"" he warned.

11,Defaulting co-operative: Rs 125 cr govt funds frozen,"PUNE: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has frozen treasury account (stamp and registration fees) number 6102002003 with a balance of Rs 124.88 crore in response to a directive issued by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Pune, towards recovery of Rs 81.67 crore from the state government. RBI general manager (banking) R. Muralidharan also assured DRT on Thursday that while the government would not be allowed to make withdrawals, daily remittances from the government account in favour of 'Recovery Officer, DRT, Pune' will be made beginning Thursday (May 29). Banking circles here expressed confidence that notwithstanding state chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar's statement that the government would ""appeal"" against the DRT order, there would now be little difficulty in recovering the long-pending dues. This development comes amid yet another action taken by DRT, Pune, for recovery of Rs 27.96 crore from the state government and the Jalgaon-based Chopda farmers' cooperative sugar factory. In his judgement of May 26, DRT presiding officer Shrikant Kulkarni issued a ""recovery certificate"" ordering recovery of dues amounting to Rs 34 crore from the Jalgaon-based factory. Delivering his order in response to a recovery suit filed by IDBI, IFCI and ICICI, Kulkarni ordered recovery of Rs 27.96 crore in favour of IDBI and IFCI from the principal borrower (cooperative sugar factory) and the state government, which served as a guarantor to the loan advanced to the sugar factory. It also ordered additional recovery of Rs 6.04 crore from the Chopda factory in favour of ICICI Ltd. In the case of the Rs 81.67-crore dues, this amount was originally due from six co-operative spinning mills from the state who defaulted on their loans from IDBI, IFCI and ICICI on various occasions in the 1990s. While IFCI's loan component was settled by the state government through a payment of Rs 25 crore in December 2002, the DRT continued with its recovery proceedings against the state government. Early this week,DRT's recovery officer S. Ravindra Yadav attached two treasury accounts, besides government properties in Pune. In its latest action, the DRT has ordered recovery of dues with future interest from the factory and the state government at the rate of 20 per cent from May 3, 2002, till realisation of the full amount.

12,'No early polls in state',"MYSORE: KPCC president Janardhana Poojary on Friday categorically ruled out early assembly elections, and said it will be held as per schedule in September 2004. After visiting Marse village, where two communities clashed recently, Poojary said he was sure that the Lok Sabha elections would be held by this November. ""We have information that BJP top bosses have decided to go for snap polls in November, along with elections to five state assemblies, he claimed, and added that was the reason the party was gearing up to meet electoral challenges. He said the intention behind hectic tours, being taken up by himself and other party leaders, including chief minister Krishna, was to activate and galvanise the party for elections to Parliament and not the assembly. He said in an electoral democracy, everyday work of a grassroots worker or leader was intended to win elections. ""It is with this principle I am going round the state. Asked whether the Congress was scared of unity among various factions of the Janata Dal, Poojary said the people no longer trusted Dal leaders, as they quarrelled among themselves. ""Even if they get united on the eve of elections, people will not vote for them as they have realised that the JD won't do anything good for the people and its leaders are power-mongers, he said.

13,"Shilpa Shetty's mother arrested, freed on bail","MUMBAI: Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty's mother Sunanda Shetty, who is an accused in an extortion case, was Friday arrested here and promptly freed on bail. Sunanda was arrested soon after her arrival from Dubai but was granted a cash bail of Rs 40,000 at Sahar police station here as per a directive of the sessions court here. On May 28, a court in Mumbai had granted Sunanda transit bail and asked her to seek regular bail in a court in Surat, where Gujarat police registered the case against and her husband Surendra Shetty, on or before June 12. Surat police registered the case against Sunanda and Surendra for allegedly hiring a gangster to recover Rs 80 lakh payable to Shilpa for endorsing ""Praful"" brand of sarees in an ad film. Police claimed to have recorded a telephonic talk between Shilpa's parents and the complainant Pankaj Agarwal, owner of Praful sarees, in this regard. Sunanda and Surendra have denied their conversation with the gangster and alleged the tape was ""manipulated."" Earlier on Friday morning, a court in Surat rejected the anticipatory bail of Surendra Shetty in the case.

14,Sonia propels her CMs into election gear,"SRINAGAR: The Congress party has put in place quotas for students from Jammu and Kashmir and also for children of migrants from the state in professional courses in all the Congress-ruled states. Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have already made generous offers for professional students and states like Kerala and Himachal Pradesh have lent a helping hand in reviving the state's tourism. Congress president Sonia Gandhi made these announcements while delivering the inaugural address at the Congress Chief Ministers Conclave here on Friday. She said all sections of the J&K society should be engaged in dialogue to address the legitimate grievances of all sympathetically. The Congress has also supported the PM's Pakistan initiative stating: We have all along believed that the doors of diplomacy and the windows of dialogue with Pakistan should always be kept open and alive. Gandhi deviated from the norm of earlier such meetings and attacked the Central government on lack of employment generation: ""This is one of our principal indictments of the BJP-led NDA government"". Keeping apart time after dinner on Friday to discuss the coming assembly elections, Gandhi has clearly indicated that the party is in an election mode and will unleash its attack on the Central government over rural poverty and employment. In 1999, 2000 and in 2002 there has been an absolute decline in both public and private employment in the organized sector. The planning commission itself estimates that at current trends, unemployment rates for youth will increase to 16 per cent by the end of the Tenth Plan, she said. In a clear message against soft Hindutva, Gandhi has congratulated Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot for arresting VHP leader Pravin Togadia. And in what could be interpreted as a warning against the Gujarat-like experiments with Hindutva by other Congress leaders, Gandhi said, ""Let us not look to what is electorally expedient"". As a poll plank the slogan, 'Congress ka haath, garib ke saath', has been further elaborated by Gandhi seeking that her CMs implement rural poverty alleviation measures, employment generation schemes and to launch food-for-work programmes. On this count, she wanted the CMs to emulate the Maharashtra model and enact a rural employment guarantee scheme and implement it in three to four years. She has asked the CMs to provide a timetable for eliminating the backlog of SC/ST quotas in government jobs, a welfare legislation for the unorganized sector and for the democratic and autonomous functioning of cooperatives.

15,Govt favours cut in farm loans interest rate: Rajnath,"LUCKNOW: Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh said the Centre favoured cut in interest rate on farm loans. Any decision in this regard, however, would have to be taken only after considering all relevant factors, he said on Saturday. He said there was an urgent need to reduce the cost of agricultural inputs and ensure that the farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. Referring to the problems of cane farmers in Uttar Pradesh, Singh said he would strive hard to ensure that the cane farmers were paid their dues. Though it was a state subject, the Centre would do everything it could to resolve the problems of the cane farmers of UP, he said, adding he had also sought information from the concerned officials about the problems being faced by cane farmers in other states. Singh expressed concern at the reported move by the Uttar Pradesh government to sell off some state sector sugar mills and said efforts should be made instead to run them. He also said that India would continue to demand that developed countries reduce subsidies they gave their farmers. To a question about the alleged misuse of drought relief funds by some states, he said he would look into the matter. Singh parried questions relating to BJP president Venkaiyah Naidu's statement regarding construction of a mosque at Ayodhya and the high profile Madhumita Shukla murder case. He also said there was no threat to the Mayawati government in the wake of Rashtriya Lok Dal pulling out of the coalition, adding there was resentment in the RLD on this issue.

16,Masood Azhar holds rally despite ban,"ISLAMABAD: Maulana Masood Azhar, leader of a militant group accused of the 2001 Indian parliament attack who was barred from addressing a party conference in Peshawar by Pakistani authorities, later addressed a gathering and hailed al-Qaeda terror network chief Osama Bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Omar as ""heroes of Muslim world"". Azhar, who has re-named his banned terror outfit Jaish-e-Muhammad as Kuddam-ul-Islam was barred from addressing 'Deefa-e-Islam' conference organised by his party on Friday at Press club in Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's volatile North West Frontier Province, on the grounds that his party has been banned. He was however allowed to lay a foundation stone for a new building and permitted to address a large Friday gathering at a mosque in Peshawar, where he said Osama and Omar showed ""supreme courage and tenacity"" against US. ""We have not lost war in Afghanistan... rather it is a step towards launching greater war against the infidels. I warn all the enemies of Islam that we will not shun jehad and continue to frustrate the enemy,"" Azhar was quoted as saying by the Pakistan daily from Peshawar, The Statesman.
