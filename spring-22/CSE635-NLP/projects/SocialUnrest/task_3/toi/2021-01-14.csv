0,India's exports have doubled since WTO,"NEW DELHI: India''s exports have almost doubled in less than a decade under the World Trade Organisation regime, an official analysis shows. Exports have gone up from $ 26.33 billion in 1994-95 to $ 51.70 billion in 2002-03. WTO was established in 1995 incorporating the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. India, a founding member of GATT, also joined WTO in 1995.

In 1995, India''s share in total world exports of goods and commercial services was 0.61 per cent. This increased to 0.86 per cent in 2001. In respect of total world imports of goods and commercial services, India''s share also increased from 0.78 per cent to 0.99 per cent during that period.

Since the entry into force of GATT with effect from January 1, 1948, and until the establishment of the WTO on January 1, 1995, eight rounds of trade negotiations were held. After the WTO came into being, five ministerial conferences, which is its highest decision-making forum, have been held. The current round of talks â€” the Doha Development Agenda, was launched in the fourth ministerial meet at Doha in 2001.

WTO was established under the Marrakesh accord and at that time, it was feared that India would find it hard to carry the onerous obligations under the accord and could lose out in world trade. Being a WTO member, India has availed of the MFN treatment and national treatment for its exports to other member-countries.

3,"Protect people, PUCL tells govt","PATNA: The human rights group â€” PUCL â€” has urged the state government to enforce the laws to stop extremist killings.

This plea was made while releasing its inquiry report into the killing of six downtrodden people on January 3 at Pariyari village by the Ranvir Sena, here on Wednesday â€” a day after another carnage was carried out in Jehanabad district in retaliation to the Pariyari killing.

The inquiry team consisted of Prabhakar Sinha, the national vice-president of PUCL, Kishori Das, the state general secretary, and others.

They warned that a series of killings might take place. ""The serial killings would continue causing heavy loss of lives, most of whom are likely to be unsuspecting defenceless persons,"" the findings remark.

They pointed out that armed groups do not seem to confront each other and appear to attack unarmed, defenceless, unsuspecting persons. Defenceless villages, where there is no risk of armed resistance, are chosen as soft targets and attacked, the PUCL remarks in the report.

PUCL observes that in the extremist-prone districts of Jehananbad and Arwal, the state government has abdicated its responsibility of protecting the life and liberty of the people, and left them to fend for themselves. Thus, there is a situation of free for all â€” leading to might is right, it has noted.

""Though it (state government) offers some relief to the families of those killed and we support such financial help,we condemn the state governmentâ€™s practice of leaving the people at the mercy of killers and then offering the families of the killed some money as a compensation, as if money can compensate for the loss of life,"" it observed.

The PUCL team had visited Pariyari and Kinjar police station and had spoken to a large number of villagers and also policemen investigating the case.

4,HC wonders if rule of law prevails in Bihar,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Wednesday wondered whether the rule of law prevails in Bihar.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice R S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh made an oral observation to this effect while referring to the lawlessness in Bihar and the failure of the police machinery to maintain law and order.

The bench was hearing the writ petition of a land parcha holder, Sohan Mahto, who submitted that the land given to him through the distribution of parchas in Raghopur Diara in 1955 is under the forcible occupation of some influential people and that the police are yet to evict the encroachers from his land.

The court took a dim view of the matter and made the oral observation in the presence of Senior SP of Patna and Vaishali SP who had been summoned in connection with the case. Parts of Raghopur Diara fall in Patna and Vaishali districts.

Malankara metropolitan Yuhannon Mar Philexinos of the Jacobite church wrote to CM Antony that the churchâ€™s application for a BEd college wasbrushed aside for not greasing the palms of the decision makers.

Anthony said he would hand over the letter to the Lok Ayukta for proper action. Consequently, the cabinet slashed the sanction given to 11 of the total 96 BEd colleges, who were found ineligible.

6,Green crusader wants strict laws to protect trees,"KOLKATA: Justice Bhagabati Prasad Bandopadhyay, who once headed the Calcutta High Court Green Bench, cannot understand the â€œstrange methodsâ€� the state forest department is conjuring to â€œkill treesâ€�.

â€œVery few people know that the forest department recently re-defined â€˜treeâ€™, saying that any plant under 10 metres would not be regarded as a tree. This is obviously a licence to kill many full grown trees in the city in the name of development,â€� the retired judge told TNN on Wednesday.

â€œBureaucrats are taking decisions without consulting the experts. However, protests from many quarters have stalled the move for the time being.â€�

Bandopadhyay fears that the state governmentâ€™s lack of initiative has derailed the mission to save the cityâ€™s greenery.

He slammed the state environment department and Pollution Control Board for failing to monitor the merciless felling of trees.

â€œThousands of trees in the cityâ€™s prime locations have been felled in the past few years to facilitate construction of flyovers and other civic work. How many trees have been replanted? Who has monitored the felling and fresh planting of trees?â€� asked Bandopadhyay.

â€œDuring During my time I would give exemplary punishment to government officers who were found guilty of dodging their duty towards the protection of the environment.â€�

Bandopadhyay fears that unbridled deforestation in the past five years has driven Kolkata to the edge of a crisis. His recommendations to the forest department have been forgotten in some dusty file.

He had suggested that the stretch from Victoria Memorial to Grand Hotel be lined on both sides by trees and a committee set up to oversee replantation. But his most radical advice â€” which could change Kolkataâ€™s face for ever â€” was to incorporate a mandatory green space clause in civic building laws.

â€œThe civic authorities should make greenery mandatory for the sanction of building orders. House owners will have to plant trees on their land,â€� he said.

7,Court orders arrest of madrasa teacher,"KOLKATA: Calcutta High Court on Monday directed police to arrest the teacher-incharge of Talbangrua High Madrasa School in Malda, Abdur Rahman, and produce him to before the court within three weeks.

The court had issued a contempt notice against Rahman for violating its earlier order where it had asked the school to allow headmaster Abdul Hossain to rejoin. But Rahaman, who had occupied the chair after Hossain was suspended, refused to accept the contempt notice.

The school had taken disciplinary action against headmaster Abdul Hossain in 1996 accusing him of not performing his regular duties as a headmaster and making others work on a false assurance of regularising their appointment.

On March 2, 1996, Hossain was suspended following which he moved high court.

Acting on the writ petition, justice Barin Ghosh, on April 23, 2003, had directed the school authorities to allow Hossain to join the school as an assistant teacher and treat him as regular.

The court also directed the school to pay his entire dues within one month.

The court had further directed the school authorities to look into the allegations against Hossain and reinstate him as headmaster if charges against him were unfounded.

Petitionerâ€™s counsel advocate Ekramul Bari said though no complaint against Hossain was substantiated, the school authorities prevented Hossain from joining duty.

8,Development fee issue rocks minority colleges,"HYDERABAD: The issue of development fees in minority professional colleges appears to be taking a turn for the worse with the third semester examinations drawing closer.

The minority college managements are sticking to the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) guidelines on collecting development fees from MBA and MCA students.

On the other hand, the students are adamant that they will not pay the fees following an Osmania University notification that the collection of such fees is illegal.

Agitations by students and their representations to university authorities since then have become a routine affair.

However, there appears to be no coordination between university authorities, officials of the State Council for Higher Education, Department of Higher Education and Minorities Welfare Department to solve the issue.

The issue needs to be solved with a joint decision of concerned departments. And in the event of a complaint reaching one of these departments, all that the concerned college is receiving is a notice seeking clarifications.

Two years back, the AICTE had prescribed Rs 9,000 and Rs 4,000 as development fees for MBA and MCA courses in the payment and free seat categories respectively.

But in a notification dated August 31, 2002, and then again on November 6, 2003, the Osmania University asked colleges not to collect more than Rs 24,750 per annum from MBA students and Rs 17,700 from MCA students.

As there are no free seats in MBA or MCA, all colleges collected Rs 9,000 as development fees. Following the OU directive, students are not only refusing to pay the fees for the current year but are also demanding that the fees paid in the previous year be adjusted against this yearâ€™s tuition fees.

Recently, the Minorities Welfare Department issued a notice to an institution warning against the fee collection, while the Osmania University issued a show cause notice to another against harassing students for the same.

During the past two months, classes are not being held properly in most of the minority colleges due to the ongoing crisis.
