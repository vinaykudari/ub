0,Group gifts new life to govt schools,"HYDERABAD: No electricity, no water, no sun proof shelter â€” these are not just s u m m e r problems, but the conditions under which thousands of children study in many of the cityâ€™s 800 odd government schools.

To help solve these problems, a voluntary organisation â€” Hyderabad Round Table 8 â€” has initiated the â€˜Project 511â€™ where corporates and individuals are roped in to adopt a government school and fund its maintenance.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, M R Shantaram of the Hyderabad Round Table 8 said that todate 80 schools have been covered under this project initiated by the Round Table and NGO, M V Foundation in October, 2003.

â€œThough many schools lack even the basic infrastructure, the ones who have these facilities have no funds to maintain them,â€� Shantaram said. The corporate who adopts the school pays for its electricity, water bills and funds any additional maintenance overheads. When the project was initially researched in 2002, there were only 511 schools, hence the name.

But now there are 832 government schools in the twincities. Each donor contributes a minimum of Rs 36,000 per annum to meet the basic/urgent needs of the school. This amount many go up Rs 1 lakh. All donors are tax-exempted.

M V Foundation mobilises teachers, school education committees and local communities and motivates them to take an active interest in the schoolâ€™s functioning. Already, in 55 schools benefits have begun to flow, in 27 schools additional teachers are being funded and 45 schools have been provided with stationary kits. Thirty donors have been acquired who have contributed a total of Rs 5.6 lakh.

â€œIt is ultimately the responsibility of the government to take care of these schools.We are doing this is to catch the attention of the government and make it take up the cause,â€� said Magsaysay award winner and founder of M V Foundation, Shanta Sinha.

The two organisations are now inviting more corporates and individuals to take up the project and help in the smooth running of the many government schools.

1,"When rivals clash, files go for a six","HYDERABAD: Sitting in an office and working was never such a pain. The cricket titans of the sub-continent â€” India and Pakistan â€” were out on the field to prove their mettle. The action was live on TV. Whoâ€™d like to push files when the heatâ€™s on in Lahore?

The babu went home. He took half-a-day off. The executive too took off. The unlucky ones crowded into board rooms where the TV was on. It was a day for cricket, let work go to hell.

The bankers kept their shop open. But there was no customer to service. â€œThe staff â€™s here. But thereâ€™s no customer. Weâ€™ve been waiting the whole day,â€� said a private bank employee from Secunderabad.

â€œThough there were many people working in the office, a fare share of them left in the afternoon. But still, considering the hype, things on the work front were not as bad,â€� said M Sreedhar, who works for an IT major. â€œIn any case, office hours are till 5.45 pm, so no one really missed the second half.â€�

In other offices, there was a spike in the number of people taking the day off. But even for those who had to work, they constantly kept getting score updates over SMS. â€œWhat a boon this SMS is,â€� exclaimed K S Anand, branch manager of a publishing house.

As dusk fell, the roads emptied out. This also meant many cinemas went without audience.

2,Chandigarh Club polls: 5 members allege irregularities,"CHANDIGARH: The affairs of the cityâ€™s premier social hub â€” Chandigarh Club â€” are getting murkier. Following the challenging of the elections scheduled on April 3, by two members recently, on Wednesday five sitting executive members of the club raised questions on the validity of the polls.

Anmol Rattan Sidhu, CM Munjal, Gopal Gupta, P Bhushan Sharma, and Ajay Bir Singh, all sitting executive members of the club, levelled allegations against acting president Sunil Khanna that he had allowed the membership of the club to exceed the 5,000-limit imposed as per Section 3 of the clubâ€™s memorandum of articles approved in 1998.

They alleged that the present membership of the club stands at 7,200 and that they had not been supplied the revised votersâ€™ list even as the annual general meeting (AGM) and the elections were approaching. They also alleged that till date, no returning officer had been appointed for the elections and the accounts for the past two years had not been shown on record.

The executive members alleged that for no fault of theirs they had been issued show-cause notices by the registrar of companies regarding the issue of membership.

Refuting the allegations Khanna said, ""I am just following the club rules. The actual membership is 6,000 which has their approval. There is no need of a returning officer as per the club rules and the AGM will appoint two scrutinisers on the poll day who will count the votes. I will announce the election results.""

Khanna said that since he wasnâ€™t vying for the presidentâ€™s post he had no axe to grind in the controversy. Munjal said that there were around 19 members in the fray for the post of eight executive members while two members Mukesh Bassi and Amarjit Singh had thrown their hat in the ring for the presidentâ€™s post.
