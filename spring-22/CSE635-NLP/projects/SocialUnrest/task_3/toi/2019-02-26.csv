0,Bengalis feel ignored by Jharkhand govt,"jamshedpur: the bengalis of jharkhand seem to be missing the good old days of lalooland. the bhadraloks are feeling ""grievously wronged"" and ""ignored"" in jharkhand. the new state has robbed the bengalis and the bangla-speaking people of the privileges they enjoyed under the bihar regime. the babulal marandi regime has overlooked their ""legitimate rights and demands."" the bengali association of jharkhand is sore with the government for not giving representation to their community in the minority commission. ""the bihar government always appointed one vice-chairman of the commission from bangla-speaking people. the jharkhand government has appointed chairman and vice-chairman from other religious and linguistic groups. we have been totally ignored,"" the association has complained to chief minister babulal marandi. the association is also peeved at the government''s ""silence"" on formation of the bangla academy in the state. ""the first bangla academy was set up in bihar in 1983. after bifurcation of the state, the largest area of bangla-speaking people has fallen within the territory of jharkhand. still, the jharkhand government is maintaining silence on formation of the academy."" ambika banerjee of the bengali association''s youth wing furthersaid no steps have been taken so far to provide textbooks at reasonable prices to students of the minority groups. that''s not all. ""the jharkhand government has not taken any initiative to fill up the vacancies in the bangla-medium schools run by the state. the government has also failed to make budgetary provisions for schools managed by the minority groups. it has resulted in irregular payment,"" adds bimlakar bhattacharjee. in a memorandum to the chief minister, the association has demanded that the bangla should be recognised as the second language of jharkhand.

1,Badal is legislative party leader of SAD,"chandigarh: chief minister parkash singh badal, who quit his office on sunday following the ruling sadbjp allianceâ€™s defeat in the assembly elections, was elected leader of the sad legislative party here on monday. at a meeting at his residence where all the newly elected sad mlas were present, badal did some soulsearching with his supporters and announced to play the role of a constructive opposition in the assembly. he said his party would humbly accept the mandate given by the people of the state. singing their party leaderâ€™s tune, the sad mlas also came down heavily on the alleged partisan role played by a section of media which had projected grossly misplaced election tally in pre-poll surveys. the party leaders demanded immediate ban on surveys and urged badal to register a strong protest with the election commission. they said the surveys were in fact prejudicial to fair and free elections that the commission promised every time. earlier, badal had echoed similar feelings after his party received a drubbing at the hustings. he said but for the biased projections made by the pre-poll surveys his party could have managed to retain power. at the meeting, badal exhorted his party mlas to safeguard the interests of the state and work for its development and growth. meanwhile, harcharan bains, media adviser to the outgoing chief minister parkash singh badal, announced to quit his office on monday. bains,who had earlier played a similar role with the congress chief ministers, declared to serve badal in the same capacity.

2,"A letter Centre, Bihar govt would like to forget","patna: the union home ministry, in a letter to the bihar home department last month, sought to establish a link between the siddiqui trust with one of the most respected institutions of bihar - the khuda bakhsh library run by the union ministry of human resource development. it is a letter that both the union and state home departments would like to forget. for, while the khuda bakhsh library management stoutly denied its alleged link with the siddiqui trust, explaining that its annual budget was met by the centre, the state home department has been wronged on its claim that there were no anti-india activities in the state. an intelligence report puts siddiquiâ€™s age at 34, pointing out that he has contributed to the cause of ""jehad in kashmir and north india"". he hails from muzaffarnagar in up, recruited boys from madarsas in north india and sent them to pakistan for a four-month training. the intelligence report suggests that siddiqui has recruited 125 students in up and bihar, though without giving the number of recruits made in bihar. interestingly, two years ago, the union home ministry had cautioned the bihar home department on muslim youths being recruited by islamic fundamentalists for jehad, directing it to caution its sps posted in bordering districts to be on the lookout for such activities. however, the state government, in a reply to a short-notice question on the floor of the assembly, replied that it did not have any ""specific information"" about such a drive. on quari salim ahmad siddiqui, the intelligence report suggests that on december 6, 1992, he had organised a meeting of muslim clerics at jansath madarsa in muzaffarnagar. ""the meeting was followed by a closed door session where pakistani agents asked the indian clerics to recruit youths for jehad and send them to headquarters of militants in bahawalpur (pakistan),"" the report says. the union home ministryâ€™s letter, however, not only talks about a trust that promotes anti-india activities, but also refers to recruitments made in bihar for jehad. it has stated that the trustâ€™s activities are funded from saudi arabia, ""ostensibly meant to promote â€˜wahabismâ€™"". ""apart from jaish-e-mohammad, lashkar-e-taiba and harkat-ul-mujahideen, the above trust has close links with al-rashid trust,"" the letter says. according to the central home department sources, the founder of this trust, quari salim ahmad siddiqui, has an equally interesting background. in 1997, siddiqui was smuggled to islamabad via dhaka and karachi. he is reported to have been given $25,000, through a network, to transfer the amount to a hawala operator at chandani chowk, new delhi. in 1998, he was reported to be working in border areas in assam to facilitate the entry of pakistan-trained militants in the area. for this work, intelligence report suggests, siddiqui received another sum of $ 25,000. siddiqui was arrested after a hot pursuit on the indo-nepal border on july 31, 1999.

15,"UK royals set to party with Britney, Elton John","london: two gallant british knights, one oddly-named ''atomic kitten'', a baldie and perhaps britney, the world''s sexiest virgin, are to unite onstage in the most unusual royal party of them all, watched by millions around the world, including india, if all goes well. as the british queen celebrates half-a-century of dull respectability on the throne, buckingham palace is striving mightily to tell the globe there is more to british royalty than fusty tradition, salacious tabloid gossip, unworthy tittle-tattle and the late-lamented princess diana. unusually for stuffy royal officials, pop music has been picked as a way into the hearts of people around the world. says simon walker, communications director at the palace, ""british music has been dominant internationally throughout the queen''s reign, so picking some of the biggest stars of that period but also some of the current pop idols of the day seems a very good way to do it"". the end result will be a multiple-starrer concert bill featuring sir paul mccartney, sir elton john, atomic kitten, phil collins and possibly, hold your breath, britney spears. eric clapton and aretha franklin will be there too, as will the dishy young princes william and harry, who have been given responsibility for whipping up enthusiasm on behalf of their grandmother. the bbc is negotiating to sell rights to the concert around the world, including india, a bbc spokesman confirmed to this paper, declining to say which local broadcaster was in talks to buy it. royal watchers described the june pop concert, with its free tickets, free champagne picnic and specially-catered menu from the royal kitchens as the british monarchy''s biggest exercise in democracy. palace spokesman stuart neill told this paper diversity was the aim, which is why invitations were being offered in six south asian languages, including hindi, urdu, gujarati, punjabi, bengali and mirpuri. young british indians said they were excited. ""who wouldn''t want a free party and a free champagne picnic,"" said london university student abhay patel. his classmate meghna said she hoped for the chance to see the young royal princes at the concert. palace officials said they expected to be inundated with more than 100,000 requests for tickets and good take-up of television rights around the world. cynical royal watchers said the palace had successfully made the queen''s golden jubilee concert a talking point around the world, but the enthusiasm was notably more for the pop stars and princes than the woman at the centre of it all, britain''s dutiful queen elizabeth ii.",london

17,Unions resume demonstrations in Kerala,"thiruvananthapuram: the indefinite strike by employees and teachers in kerala entered the 20th day on monday with no major improvement in the attendance position as most unions, cutting across political lines, continued to stay away demanding restoration of curtailed perks. the unions, owing allegiance to congress and opposition ldf, resumed street demonstrations after the weekend holidays here and in the district headquarters in the absence of any government initiative to call the unions for at least a round of ""face-saving"" talks. the sharp division in the congress, heading the ruling udf combine, had become more pronounced with senior leader k. karunakaran, on sunday demanding a meeting of the congress legislature party to discuss the situation. ever since the strike began on february 6, karunakaran had been criticising the ""adamant"" attitude of chief minister antony towards the employees. indications are also there that the prinicipal opposition cpm would organise demonstrations and picketings through its youth and trade union wings to keep the morale of the striking unions up. with the strike entering the fourth week it is also being keenly watched whether it it would have an impact on the budget session of the state assembly scheduled to commence on february 28 with the governor''s policy address.

18,Antony govt hopes to wear out agitators,"thiruvananthapuram: there appears no sign of hope for an early settlement to the three-week-long employees'' agitation in kerala. the government machinery is at a standstill and the future of lakhs of students hangs in the balance. the strategy of the antony government, say knowledgeable sources, is to wear the agitators out. the employees and teachers on stir want restoration of some of their privileges. since cutting on salary bill is the first step towards pruning expenditure and economic reforms in store, giving in to the unions'' collective might would be suicidal, it is argued in government circles. the service organisations and workers'' unions which have gone on strike with a rare show of solidarity too have no escape route. the union leaders could not go back without something to show as achievement. the unions have been sending plaintive cries and pleas to the opposition cpm and the congress patriarch, k. karunakaran. karunakaran''s now-famous refrain that he has a ""formula"" to end the strike has caused much heartburn in the ruling congress. despite many calls to the congress president sonia gandhi''s office to restrain karunakaran, the ""leader"" remains unreined. he has now called for a congress legislature party meeting to discuss the stir issue. earlier, the ruling coalition meeting convened on february 18 to work out a solution had ended with a call to strengthen antony''s hands. meanwhile, the kerala pcc-i chief and karunakaran''s son, k. muralidharan has asked the striking employees to suspend their strike for a talk with the government on restoring some of their slashed privileges owing to the financial stringency. though karunakaran lends his moral support to the strikers, muralidharan has publicly stood firm behind the chief minister and his cabinet. ""the employees can not question the government''s right to restrict certain privileges'', he has argued. the employees are sore that the government has suspended the annual leave encashment facility and reduced the commutation sum at retirement. in an obvious hardening of the stance, chief minister a k antony has also ruled out any scope of raising the retirement age of the employees from the existing 55 years to 58 years as demanded by the unions. on the 20th day of the strike on monday, the police stepped up arrests under the essential services maintenance act of the striking employees. the police held 10 under esma and brought the esma-arrest so far to 193. some 116 people were also arrested for violation of various laws in different parts of the state on monday. at the ekm high scool in manatahawadi of wynad, the pro-strikers damaged the school property and abused teachers. in thiruvananthapuram, the striking employees broke open the government handicraft shop and damaged articles. the police said in several places, the strikers have begun to intimidate the private school teachers and managements who have defied the call for strike. many social leaders have offered their services to mediate between the government and the striking employees, but the government has not responded to any of them.
