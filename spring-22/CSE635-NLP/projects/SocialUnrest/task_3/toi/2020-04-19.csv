0,NGOs doing govt's work in Pathankot,"PATHANKOT/TALWARA: Where the government fails, non governmental organisations (NGOs) rise to the occasion. SGN Medical Education and Social Welfare Society, Talwara, has been reaching out to far flung, sub-mountainous Kandi areas of Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur districts where quality health care and education are hard to come by.

On the concluding day of the five-day Awareness Generation Project (AGP), on Saturday, a team of doctors led by NGO president Santosh Sharma urged women in villages to fight female foeticide and stop their husbands, fathers and brothers from drinking at homes.

The focus of the five-day camp at Beh Lakhan village near Talwara was on medical care and imparting training in paramedical technology, mid-wifery, child health care and AIDS.

Talking to TNN on Saturday, NGO general secretary Dr Meena Gulshan said that since its inception in 1996 the NGO had adopted villages under its schemes and extended medical care to thousands of people in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh villages. She added that the major contribution had, however, been in remote areas of Mukerian tehsil of Hoshiarpur district where Reproductive Child Health (RCH) programmes have been launched with the help of Chandigarh-based NGO - Society for Service to Voluntary Agencies (SOSVA) -led by former Punjab chief secretary PH Vaishnav.

The programme aiming to reach at least 20,000 persons each year focuses on health awareness for pregnant women, children below age of five years and adolescents.

â€˜â€˜We have been organising AIDS awareness programmes (like the five-day camp at Beh Lakhan village), seminars, rallies and exhibitions,â€™â€™ said Dr Gulshan. Society president Santosh Sharma said that in the year 2002 as many as 15 women had been taught the latest in mid-wifery under the guidance of SOSVA, another 50 women have been taught about poverty, pollution, health problems and vaccination, said Sharma.

Similarly, several camps have been organised with the help of PNB and other banks, he added. Institute of Ecology and Environment headed by Dr Sudhir Mahotra is yet another NGO in Pathankot which is organising social campaigns on AIDS, pollution, environment and yoga in the schools of Dhar block and Pathankot.

Mahotra, from time to time, organises seminars, exhibitions as well as debates on AIDS for young school children. Awareness campaigns have also been launched to save the flora and fauna of Dhar Kalan block which is rich in medicinal plants.

1,Elderly couple attempts suicide after poisoning disabled son,"KOLKATA: A couple attempted suicide after poisoning their son to death at a private lodge at Sealdah.

Dipak Chatterjee (36) was dead by the time police arrived at the spot. The critically ill elderly couple, Satya (58) and Chhaya Chatterjee (54) were rushed to NRS Hospital and Medical College in an unconscious state, DCP (central) Zulfiquar Hasan said.

Preliminary investigation revealed that Satya and his wife, residents of Ramkrishna Pally in Durgapur, arrived at the private lodge reportedly to treat their son who was suffering from a leg deformity for a long time. Police suspected the family became bankrupt after prolonged treatment.

They also did not rule out all three attempting suicide together. Though the family was supposed to check out on Saturday, police did not find a single paisa with them. The documents found with the family showed their only son was suffering from severe ailment like cerebral palsy.

At 11.30 am, the lodge owner became suspicious when no one responded to telephone calls to the room the family had rented. Finding the door locked from inside, the hotel employees peeped through the keyhole and saw husband and wife writhing in pain on the bed. Police broke open the door to find Dipak dead.

Kolkata police has contacted their counterparts in Burdwan for collecting facts about the family to ascertain the reason behind their suicide attempt. Though no suicide note was found, the police suspected that the couple had lost all hope that their son would recover someday.

2,Gender policy aims to empower women in Gujarat,"GANDHINAGAR: In a step that may have far-reaching social consequences, the Gujarat government proposes to extend the one-third representation to women--constitutionally provided in local government bodies--to all institutions where public decision-making is involved.

It simultaneously proposes to re-examine 25 different laws to provide equal economic and governance rights to women, end sexual harassment of women at workplace, stop domestic violence and indecent representation in the media. A statutory body for the development of women is envisaged to fulfil the tasks.

The Gujarat Gender Equity Policy, whose draft is in final stages with the women and child development department, wants the state government to ensure that one-third women be included in all â€œpublic decision making bodiesâ€�. The document says, â€œIn order to promote womenâ€™s participation in decision-making bodies, government shall amend all acts and rules pertaining to registration of trusts, societies, associations, institutions and corporations to include one-third women in the governing boards.â€�

The document insists, â€œAt least one-third membership of women in all state-constituted advisory boards and empowered groups be ensured.â€� Also, there should an â€œinitial 30 per cent reservation in all allotments of commercial and residential plots made by local bodies, housing boards, development authorities, etc. in urban areas, increasing to 50 per cent over time.â€� Gujarat is the third state in India to come up with a gender-equity policy. The states that have similar policies are Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

The document also says, â€œOne-third seats shall be reserved for women for posts in government extension services in rural areas for proper and adequate dissemination and extension of government programmes and schemes for women.â€� Similar reservation is also evisaged for the â€œinstitutions which are responsible for the development of vocational, technical and managerial skills required for productive employment.â€� Besides, â€œInstitutions like cooperatives, market yards and educational institutions should set aside specific funds for womenâ€™s development.â€�

Particularly recognising the need for womenâ€™s participation in water-related issues, even while showing clear dissatisfaction with the recent amendment to the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB) Act seeking just one woman out of the boardâ€™s nine directors, the document says, â€œThe GWSSB needs to be actively involved in the process of gender sensitivity in its projects. There should be more representation of women on the GWSSB board.â€� The document wants women to decide on how much of water should be allocated to household, agriculture and commercial use. It says, â€œIn water supply, a portfolio approach to technologies needs to be adopted that can respond to the local needs with appropriate and sustainable models. NGOs such as Utthan-Mahiti have successfully intitiated water bank where women are managing to decide how much water should be given for household, agriculture and commercial use.

Such strategies should be adopted in other parts of Gujarat.â€� The section on â€œPolitical Participation of Womenâ€� recognises the current onethird reservation in local bodies has not gone far enough. It says, â€œIn order to promote womenâ€™s effective participattion in the panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodiesâ€�, the Gujarat Panchayat Act, 1993, and the Bombay Municipalities Act, 1993, should be amended to create womenâ€™s empowerment fund to help women heading the local bodies to act more independently.

The document recognises that though all government programmes and schemes have a â€œclearly articulated empowerment focusâ€�, unfortunately, â€œthere is no aggregate data available on womenâ€™s empowerment programmes taken up by different government departments, NGOs and other public institutions in terms training programmes and services offered.â€� As a result, the panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies, obliged to give one-third representation to women, are unable to â€œpromote womenâ€™s effective participation.â€� Such data base should be created immediately.

3,"BJP man is VMC mayor, Congress boycotts polls","VADODARA: Stung by the humiliating defeat in Rajkot, the Congress workers, staging a noisy protest, boycotted the mayoral elections in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Saturday.

While BJPâ€™s Narayan Patel was declared elected as new mayor of Vadodara, the Congress workers were dragged out of the corporation premises by policemen, leaving two senior leaders severely injured. It was high drama in the corporation as Congress alleged that two of its women councillors were kidnapped in Bharuch to prevent them from voting.

Trouble began around 11.45 am when a few Congress councillors pressed the panic button over reports of two women councillors, Parvati Pandya and Hamida Khureshi, being kidnapped in Bharuch. The incident resulted in a furore among Congress councillors and an emergency meeting of the party workers was called.

An FIR was filed in Bharuch when the two councillors failed to turn up for voting beginning at 4.30 pm. After Fridayâ€™s bedlam leading to postponement of the elections, the House resumed on Saturday with noisy protests by Congress councillor Chinnam Gandhi, Opposition leader Dalsukh Prajapati, former deputy mayor Chirag Zaveri, Chandrakant Shrivastav and Sahyog Party member Ashok Pawar.

They rushed to the rostrum asking presiding mayor Bharti Vyas to delay the election procedure till the two women councillors returned. They were joined by angry women councillors who snatched the mike from the mayor when she ordered the municipal secretary to allow policemen to intervene. While Zaveri fell unconscious, Gandhi broke his leg when dragged out of the premises. They were joined by other Congress councillors and Sahyog Party members, who boycotted the voting session. However, Vyas allowed the voting to proceed and announced Narayan Patelâ€™s name as the new mayor of the city. The session lasted for 45 minutes.

The House had a voting strength of 73 out of a total of 77 as four membersâ€”independent candidate Nisar Bapu, Congress councillors Hamida Khureshi and Parvati Pandya and Anuj Patelâ€” were absent. â€œThe absence of Anuj Patel is being brought to the notice of the state party president,â€� said Dalsukh Prajapati. â€œWe have filed an FIR in Bharuch as we suspect two of our councillors have been kidnapped near a hotel there. They had gone to Bharuch with 28 fellow Congress workers for a get-together,â€� added Prajapati. â€œThe BJP has acted in sheer desperation.

After managing the support of independent candidate Dilip Kothari, there was just one way the party could have routed us out of the race and that was by preventing the two vulnerable Congress councillors,â€� said deputy mayor and Sahyog Party leader Shailesh Sotta Mehta. â€œThis election also brings to fore the partisan behaviour of the presiding mayor who let outsiders to vandalise public property. When Congress councillors protested democratically, they were dragged by policemen out of the premises,â€� rued Sotta.

4,Teachers decide on protest in Manohar Joshi's constituency,"LUCKNOW: Higher education teachers have decided to hit the Union human resource development minister MM Joshi where it hurts the most. Angry at his attitude of indifference, higher education teachers from across the state have decided to hold demonstrations in Allahabad, the constituency that the minister represents in the Lok Sabha.

Back in the city after taking part in a day-long demonstration organised by the All India Federation of University College Teachersâ€™ Organisations (Aifucto), teachers said they have been demanding an audience with the minister for the past several months, but the minister is yet to grant them an audience. As a result, LU Associated College Teachersâ€™ Association (Luacta) general secretary Moulindu Mishra, who also participated in the demonstration, proposed at an Aifucto meeting, that a demonstration be held in Allahabad, to inform the cityâ€™s denizens of the apathy of the Union minister.

The teachers have also warned the government to not allow the commercialisation of higher education. Mishra said, while the government had said it was committed to the uplift of Dalits and minorities, it was in fact promoting the privatisation and commercialisation of higher education. This would hit the Dalits and the minorities the hardest, as the majority of them belong to the economically weaker sections. Other demands include implementation of promotional benefits and recruitment of additional teachers for a proper teacher-student ratio, and an increase in budgetary allocation for education to 20 per cent.

5,"Colleges spurn govt move, go ahead with admissions","BANGALORE: Ahead of the Karnataka cabinet meeting on April 22 where a final decision to resolve the CET imbroglio is to be taken, private professional college managements upstaged the state governmentâ€™s move by announcing the seatsâ€™ quota and fee structure here on Saturday.

The managements have stuck to their stand to part with only 25 per cent of the seats in engineering, medical and dental courses to meritorious students and weaker sections through CET. The annual fee for students under government quota for medical, dental and engineering courses will be Rs 50,000, Rs 40,000 and Rs 20,000 respectively. The balance amount will be met by the college management through scholarships for students.

Karnataka Private Management Collegesâ€™ Association president Shamanur Shivashankarappa told reporters that the colleges will go ahead with the admission process based on the fee structure announced, notwithstanding the governmentâ€™s decision on the issue. â€œWe plan to complete the admission process before MCIâ€™s deadline of July 31,â€™â€™ he added. However, the managements are ready to give 50 per cent seats to the government only on one condition.

According to Congress functionaries R.L. Jalappa and Prabhakar L. Kore, who run professional colleges, they were ready to increase the government quota seats to 50 per cent only if the ministers on the management board of various colleges implemented it. â€œLet the ministers first offer 50 per cent of the seats to the government, all of us will follow suit,â€™â€™ Jalappa said. â€œThe admission process and fee structure evolved by the private colleges are as per the directions of the Supreme Court.

The fee structure is only the recovery of revenue expenses in running the institutions and not capital cost or investments,â€™â€™ Shivashankarappa maintained. Of the remaining 75 per cent of the seats, 25 per cent will be for All India Open Merit (selection of non-Karnataka candidates based on performance in CET); 40 per cent for Open Merit Karnataka (for Karnataka candidates based on CET-PU aggregate); and 10 per cent for management quota. For these three categories, the annual fees are Rs 3 lakh for medical course, Rs 2 lakh for dental and Rs 60,000 for engineering courses.

The colleges have agreed to honour the merit determination by the CET Cell only for this academic year (2003-04), Shivashankarappa said and demanded that the government convert it into an autonomous body by next year. Admitting that students might face inconvenience, he asked them to prepare for CET as it would be the basis for admissions this year. CET is slated for May 30 and 31. On April 17 the government held discussions with the college representatives which failed to yield results with both refusing to budge from their stands.

6,SP takes out cycle rally,"LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party on Saturday launched its counter-offensive against the Mayawati-led BSP-BJP coalition government by taking out cycle rallies all over the state, which will culminate here on May 12. All party MPs, MLAs, district and city level office-bearers will take part in it.

The rallies, according to party sources, are a part of the partyâ€™s programme for creating mass awakening against the misdeeds of Mayawati and mobilise public support for the partyâ€™s rally here.

Reports reaching the state headquarters said that the day passed off peacefully with no untoward incident reported from any part of the state.

Although the CM had adopted a tough stance against the SP by trying to nail its leader Mulayam Singh Yadav on various counts, the administration, for a change, turned out to be benevolent towards SP activists, who were allowed to take out rallies in their respective areas.

In Lucknow, the rally was flagged off by state party president Ram Saran Das and leader of the opposition in the assembly Azam Khan, who gave a call for the ouster of Mayawati, criticising her for her â€œanti-people policiesâ€� and â€œcorrupt practicesâ€�. They said the BJP was a party to her every misdeed, as she was in power with its support.

Leading the rally, state unit vice-president Bhagwati Singh and general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav accused Mayawati of indulging in a politics of vengeance and said that she was â€œimplicating her political rivals in fake casesâ€�.

The rally decision was taken by the SP as a counter-offensive against Mayawati after the administration filed 137 cases against Mulayam Singh Yadav in apparent retaliation to the two CDs released by the party projecting the CM as a politician hungry for money and against those believing in idol-worship.

This was not taken kindly by the CM, who believed that it was aimed at tarnishing her image and creating a rift between the BSP and the BJP and, thereby, trying to pull down her government.

In Varanasi, SP workers garlanded the statue of Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar before proceeding towards various assembly constituencies.

On the occasion, they also garlanded the statue of Mahatma Gandhi. Respect for the two leaders, the workers said, was their commitment to fight against caste divide in the society.

In Allahabad, the SP activists, including women, burnt the effigy of Mayawati just outside the venue where the Union HRD minister MM Joshi was addressing mediapersons in the Civil Lines area.

9,New system for govt depts to pay electricity bills,"LUCKNOW: The state government has decided a new process for payment of bills for electricity consumed by the urban local bodies, nagar nigams, nagar palika parishads, nagar panchayats, jal sansthans, river pollution control projects, drinking water supply of schemes of jal nigam and various government departments.

While the earlier orders issued to the respective departments have been cancelled, a new order by chief secretary DS Bagga states that the amount of power bill arrears outstanding against these bodies till March 31 would be adjusted with the remaining amount of loans sanctioned to the UPPCL by the state government earlier. Subsequently, there will be no outstanding power bill against these bodies for the period till March. The power bills of these bodies will be verified by the divisional commissioners and district magistrates concerned.

Bagga has directed CMD UPPCL Arun Kumar Misra to ensure that the bills sent to these bodies after April 1 should show all the outstanding arrears as zero. According to the new process, excluding sewerage plants of nagar nigams, jal nigams and jal sansthans will be presented by the concerning division of the UPPCL to the offices of the nagar nigams/ jal nigam every month.

These bills will be verified and countersigned by the concerning divisional commissioners and sent to the headquarters of UPPCL by the 7th of every month.

Similarly, the electricity of jal sansthans under all the nagar palika parishads, nagar panchayats and Jhansi and Chitrkoot Dham divisions will be sent by 25th of every month by the concerning electricity division of the districts to the concerning executive officer of the jal sansthan. These bills will be verified and then countersigned by the concerning DM and sent to the UPPCL headquarters.

The UPPCL will submit the verified bills to the urban development department, which will deduct the amount equal to the bill amount through devolution from the assistance sanctioned by state finance commission to the concerning bodies and will pay the bill to the UPPCL at the central level itself.

For payment of the electricity bills of the sewerage plants under the river pollution control projects, the urban development department will make necessary provision in the budget. The department will ensure payment of electricity bills at the central level.

The electricity bills of all the government departments, medical colleges, hospitals, police stations, tehsils, educational institutions will be submitted to the authorised officer of the department.

In case the payment of the bill is not made within the stipulated period, the full detail of the amount outstanding against the government offices should be submitted to the concerning DM, who will then seek reasons for non-payment of the bill and take action.

10,Pandya's father skeptical about Asghar's arrest,"AHMEDABAD: Fabricated! That''s is how Vitthaldas Pandya, father of Haren Pandya, describes the arrest of his son''s alleged killer and his accomplices from Hyderabad.

Pandya is sad that each word that he had uttered at the condolence meeting at the Town Hall on April 6, in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, is coming true.

He recalls he had told Advani that the police would make some random arrests and present themselves as the killers. He still firmly believes that it was an ""intentional political murder"". ""I still believe that the real culprit is still at large,"" says Pandya.

And most of the sackful of condolence letters which the family has received so far too echo Pandya''s sentiment. ""Some people may say that Haren''s family members are overreacting. But what about these letters? These people are not Haren''s relatives,"" says Pandya.

A lot of these letters are written by Muslims and Christians, he said. ""And if he was hated by minorities, how does one explain the presence of a large number of Muslims in his area?"" he asks.

""A very senior government functionary was quoted as saying immediately after the murder that there was an underworld hand in it. Such statements clearly affected the inquiry,"" he said.

About the arrests from Hyderabad, he says: ""Why will the sharpshooters stay in the country after committing the crime. Logically, they would flee to Pakistan or some other country.""

Pandya believes that along with nabbing the killer, it''s equally important to get the master-mind behind the killing. ""The people who killed my son were tools, I wish that the person who plotted the murder is brought to book.""

Justifying his line of argument that it was a political murder, Pandya says: ""Haren used to go out for his walk and to play golf for months after the riots. Then why was he killed just before he was about to be appointed to an important post in the central BJP.""

Criticising the negligence on the part of authorities, Pandya says: ""In spite of the fact that the letter written to Harin Pathak (Union Minister of State for Home) talked about the threat perception to Haren''s life along with 10 other people, it was only my son who did not get any security cover. The matter was reportedly brought to state Home Minister Amit Shah''s notice, but nothing was done. I feel that the warning was neglected intentionally.""

12,Police confirm arrest of suspected ISI agent,"HYDERABAD: The police on Saturday announced the arrest of suspected ISI agent Zubair Shareef, 27, a resident of Kurmaguda in Saidabad. Zubair was taken into custody along with at least five others on Friday.

Police said Zubair and five othersâ€”all from Saidabadâ€”were picked up by Mohammed Abdul Rauf, one of the suspects in the Haren Pandya murder conspiracy. The six-member team was sent to Kolkata on Nov. 6, 2002 and from there to Hong Kong where they were received by Iqbal and Sohail. The contacts took the team to Islamabad via Karachi where they were trained at an ISI camp in handling weapons and manufacturing improvised explosive devices. Then they were sent back to Hong Kong where the contacts tampered the passports of all the six members by pasting fake Iranian visas in place of Pakistan visas, police said. The six â€œtrained militantsâ€� returned home via Kolkata and met Rauf. The latter instructed them to lie low for a couple of months in view of heightened vigilance following a bomb blast at Saibaba temple at Dilsukhnagar in the city, police said and added that the other militants would be arrested soon.

Meanwhile, the Nalgonda police reportedly picked up Syed Nurul Rahman, 24, a resident of Narketpally in Nalgonda district on Friday. Sources said Rahman returned to his native place recently after â€œmissingâ€� for about three years. Sources said that Rahman, a close aide of Asgar Ali, had been trained by the ISI. He was picked up following instructions from the intelligence agencies and was handed over to the latter for questioning, sources added.

13,"SP fears Mulayam, Amar arrests imminent","NEW DELHI: The Samajwadi Party on Saturday expressed the apprehension that its senior leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh were going to be arrested by the Mayawati government any time now, if necessary by invoking Pota.

""Mayawati has reduced politics in Uttar Pradesh to gang warfare,"" Singh said, while insisting that both of them would go ahead with their programmes in the state.

Singh said that there was no change in his schedule to address party workers in Varanasi on Sunday. ""I do not know what will happen there,"" he said betraying a nervousness.

He accused Mayawati of unleashing ""a reign of terror and being selective"" in targeting her political rivals. ""Even the judge who listened to my application for anticipatory bail remarked that he himself felt insecure in UP,"" he said.

Singh said that the CM''s remarks that he would be picked up from wherever he was made it clear that Pota would be invoked for the purpose. The state administration, he said, had denied the SP permission to hold a cycle rally in Kanpur.

The SP leader claimed that recently 12 hardened criminals serving prison terms in Aligarh had been allowed to flee by the jail administration. He alleged these outlaws had been given the contract to physically eliminate him.

""I have already written to Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani about it and got a reply from him,"" he said.

Singh refuted Mayawati''s charge that hearing of her proposed tough action against them both Mulayam and he had been on the run. ""The day after the FIR was lodged both of us were in different parts of UP,"" he said.

He claimed that local police officers had pleaded with them to leave their areas so that they did not have to perform the unpleasant task of arresting them.

18,'Communication gap to blame for suicides',"CHANDIGARH: Though the cause has not been established in most of the recent suicide cases, psychiatrists blame them on lack of communication among family members.

They maintain that the symptoms of depression shown by people prone to committing suicide are easily identified in a closely knit family. Seven cases of suicide have been reported in the city in the last five days and in all of these, the victims were suffering from depression.

Psychiatrist B S Chawan says that parents should always consider stress among children seriously and seek timely medical help.

''''In the present scenario, people are overstressed and tied to a monotonous routine, which often becomes a cause for depression. Even the violence shown on TV compels people to take the extreme step,'''' he says.
