1,Rajnath drops another minister,"lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh on tuesday dropped one more minister of his cabinet-- ashok yadav. he is the second minister after naresh agarwal, to be shunted out of the cabinet on charges of corruption. yadav, holding independent charge of minister of state for tourism, was in the eye of storm for quite some time for his alleged involvement in ""land grabbing"" in new delhi. the chief minister had sacked the then power minister naresh agarwal, on august 9. a decision to drop yadav was announced by the cm at a hurriedly- summoned press conference at his 5, kalidas marg on tuesday evening. everything went in a calculated manner. both party president jana krishnamurthy and party spokesman vijay kumar meharotra were also informed about his decision by the cm on telephone in delhi during the press conference. no decision has yet been taken about yadav's expulsion from the party, as no word was available from the bjp chief kalraj mishra, who left for new delhi after the development. but it is expected that yadav was on his way out from the bjp. yadav was in delhi when the action was taken against him. the cm said there was no need to give prior information to yadav, as he was a bjp minister, who was expected to follow the party line. yadav himself appears to be blamed for this situation. as the cm puts it , ``yadav was spitting venom against government's policy decision on the reservation to the most backward classes (mbc)"". he said this was nothing but a clear case of anti-party activity and a matter of gross indiscipline. ""i was left with no option but to take action against him after giving him enough time to mend his ways,"" the cm said, adding that anybody trying to oppose the reservation to the mbc would face such actions. ""we want to remove the poverty and prejudices on the basis of castes and the mbc policy has been designed to address to these problems,"" he said. although action against yadav was expected,the cm kept his cards close to his chest until he returned from a meeting of bjp mps ,addressed among others by former party president and incharge of up affairs kushabhao thakrey, at the bjp office on tuesday .returning back to his kalidas marg, the cm scribbled a letter and went straight to the raj bhawan around 5 p.m. to hand over it to governor vishnu kant shastri. the dismissal was readily accepted by the governor with whom the cm spent about half an hour. he then hurriedly called the press at his residence to announce yadav's dismissal , who was later also suspended from the bjp' legislator party.

2,"Chauhan rally, a damp squib","tanda (hoshiarpur): former khalistan ideologue jagjit singh chauhan's first public appearance in his native town after 21 years created some tension as shiv sena activists held a parallel rally, demanding the state government take action against chauhan's alleged secessionist activities. shiv sainiks kept the pathankotjalandhar highway blocked for more than two hours, even as chauhan held his first public meeting at the nearby grain market. police remained on alert fearing shiv sainiks' activities might lead to a backlash from the small gathering that had assembled for chauhan's meeting. while chauhan tempered his ideology, saying he wanted 'khalsa raj' and not a separate sikh state, his public appearance revived talk of khalistan here. while some sought to describe him as a 'spent force,' others feared it might not augur well for the state. look, how conveniently he has returned to public life after spewing venom against the state for decades. a lesser person would have been eliminated by the police by now,'' remarked a sikh shopkeeper. even the poor response to his appearance was attributed by some to popular curiosity about a leader who had twice represented them in the vidhan sabha the 60s and whose name subsequently became synonymous with khalistan. everybody seemed to believe that chauhan had come back to play yet another innings in politics after having burnt his fingers in militancy. in his address, chauhan, however, denied he intended to contest the forthcoming vidhan sabha election, though he did not rule out the possibility of fielding independent candidates. in his quest to win favour for himself, chauhan apparently overstretched himself to explain that he was never a proponent of khalistan. he said he was projected in a wrong light by people with vested interests. he, however, admitted favouring a 'khalsa raj' which, he said, was far from what the congress and shiromani akali dal had given to the state. he said his decision to return to politics was spurred by the fact that both the major political parties had spelt rot for the state. he was more critical of the sad, which, he said, had undermined khalsa values and wrought disappointment on the people. the tone and tenor of his address clearly indicated that he aspired to eat into the akali vote bank. not surprisingly, the lesser akali leaders from different factions also shared stage with him. rajinder singh khunga of akali dal (amritsar), who was also the stage secretary, said, regardless of his party affiliation, he would vote and support chauhan in the coming election if the latter chose to contest. but he added if chauhan fielded other candidates they might not join hands with him. a portrait of chauhan, which did not reflect his age, was put precariously close to the stage where some of his old supporters came to shake hands with or garland him. as no outsider, including ram jethmalani and supporters of former prime minister chandra shekhar, joined him at the meeting, it proved a damp squib, though it might have helped chauhan test waters for himself. a majority of his supporters seemed to have come from his native village, nangal khunga, about 15 km from here.

10,Nariman Point multiplex plan sparks protest,"mumbai: the proposal for a multiplex cinema in the multi-storied car parking and commercial complex in front of bajaj bhavan at nariman point is facing strong criticism from residents of the area. the matter is pending with the commissioner of police for a ``no objection certificate''. the police, in a move to involve citizens in the decision, has invited the public to submit objections on the issue before october 15. the residents feel that the proposed multiplex will make the movement of traffic impossible for the public at large. ``a large number of office-goers and businessmen come to nariman point in their cars. while the multi-tiered parking lot will be a boon for them, the cinema hall will negate the entire benefit by generating extra traffic,'' said navin kumar of the colaba cuffe parade citizens association. this is the second time that the complex, which is being developed by larsen and tourbo (l&t) and piramal holdings, is encountering opposition. in a similar controversy earlier this year, the proposal for a commercial complex in the building intended to be developed as a multi-storied parking lot was opposed by local associations. they said the move would have disastrous consequences for the area. at that time, the developers had assured critics that the building would only be a peripheral shopping centre, focusing mainly on food outlets which would benefit office-goers. however, the latest proposal to have five mini cinema-halls on the first floor of the building has once again raised the ire of the residents. the nariman point association (npa), a representative body of buildings in the area, is all set to move the court against this proposal. ``we are absolutely against the idea of the multiplex as it amounts to a proposal which will only add to the already teeming crowds in the central business district(cbd)'' said npa adviser jayant jariwala. residents also point out that, since the site is next to vidhan sabha, the traffic situation will be nightmarish whenever the legislative assembly is in session. the mumbai metropolitan regional development authority (mmrda) had given the land to the developers, the sole bidders for the proposal, on the condition that it would provide for parking space as well as modestly-priced eating places. mmrda put these conditions keeping the office-goers' needs in mind. however, mmrda is now not against the proposal for the mutiplex. v.k phatak, chief of the town and country planning department, said, ``under the development control rules for greater mumbai (1991), a developer of a parking space can develop additional space as long as it comes within the normal floor space index (fsi). mmrda will give the go-ahead signal once police permission is obtained.''

""i will strictly adhere to them in running the party,"" vasan said. vasan said his party's goal was to establish 'kamaraj rule' (congress rule) in the state and he would work towards it. earlier, addressing the party's general council, which met for the first time after moopanar's death, vasan said he would undertake extensive tour of the state after the local body polls.
