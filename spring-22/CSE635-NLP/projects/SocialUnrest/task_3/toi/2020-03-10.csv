1,Govt ignores dharna by farmers,"PATIALA: The Punjab Government has taken no note of the dharna being staged here for the last six days by Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) in favour of their demands.

On the other hand, farmers are committed to continuing their dharna till the acceptance of their demands, for which the farmers of this area are extending full support to them.

The farmers are sending around 20 quintal milk daily, besides flour, vegetables and fuel to run the roadside langar in front of the PSEB headquarters.

Interestingly, milk is being served to the participants because there is only one municipal tap for potable water. To take bath, the participants go to gurdwaras.

3,"No 'distress sale' of rice, paddy, says minister","PATNA: Union minister for food and civil supplies Sharad Yadav admitted here on Sunday that despite opening of 100 purchasing centres of Food Corporation of India (FCI) in Bihar for procurement of paddy and rice, 100 per cent procurement has not been achieved. Talking to mediapersons, he said that Bihar lacked basic infrastructure and he would take steps to create that.

Even workers for these centres were sent from New Delhi, he pointed out. By opening these centres here he has succeeded in stopping â€œdistress saleâ€� of paddy and rice by farmers, he stated. Even the storage capacity of the FCI godowns here is much below the requirement and there is a demand to increase the capacity by three lakh MT more in addition to the existing capacity of five lakh MT, he said adding that he is ready to construct more godowns, if the state government provides land at reasonable price for the same. â€œSometimes the prices of land is so high that to purchase it is not commercially viable,â€� he maintained. In reply to a question, he stated that he is ready to secure private godowns so that more foodgrains can be procured and stored.

He informed that he has received complaints against some of these centres which are inactive and do not purchase paddy and rice from farmers. â€œI will find out the causes and make them operational,â€� he added. FCI regional manager C P Sharma, who too was present at the Press briefing, said that purchase of paddy and rice will continue till March end. On Lalooâ€™s call to his men to keep a lathi each in self-defence and observe â€œlathi ko tel pilao diwasâ€� at the Gandhi Maidan here, Yadav said that it is the manifestation of his â€œinner fearâ€� , as ever since the Ashiana More incident, in which three innocent students were killed by the police in a fake encounter, Laloo feels panicky.

4,Tibbi college students turn violent,"PATNA: The students of the Government Tibbi College and Hospital (GTCH), ransacked the college, set the furnitures on fire and kept the staff including the principal hostage for more than three hours by locking them in a room here on Monday.

They were agitating against the non-fulfilment of their long pending demands which includes a new college building, post-graduate course, hostel, six months internship at PMCH and stipend equivalent to MBBS students. The students were assured by the minister for medical education Shakeel Ahmed to look into their grievances in 20 days. The incident took place at around 11 am when the students of the college turned violent at the expiry of the 20-day time, which ended on Sunday. They broke the windowpanes and furnitures of the principal''s office.

Some of the angry students collected the chairs and tables from different class rooms in the campus and set them on fire. The situation was brought under control after the Kadamkuan police entered the campus by breaking the locked gate and set the staff free. The principal was set free only after the magistrate on duty N K Pandey assured them of a meeting with the chief minister on March 14.

The students of the college had earlier blocked the Bailey Road on February 17 to press for fulfilment of their demands. They had suspended their agitation only after an assurance from Ahmad to look into the matter personally and take necessary steps for improvement of the college.

5,Both Houses paralysed over law & order,"PATNA: Both the Houses of state legislature remained paralysed on Monday as a determined opposition pressed for adjournment motion over the police firings in the state after the fake police encounter at Ashiana Nagar here.

In both the Houses, adjournment motions were rejected by the presiding officers, which led to disruption in the proceedings. The state legislative council was adjourned in the pre-lunch session by chairman Jabir Hussain following a din over charges and counter-charges levelled by the opposition and ruling party benches on the issue of kidnapping and â€œdeterioratingâ€� law and order situation. When the House proceedings started, NDA leaders moved an adjournment motion on the issue of â€œincreasing incidence of kidnapping and poor law and order situationâ€�.

The chairman refused to accept the adjournment motion as the House was to take up the debate over the motion of thanks on the governorâ€™s speech at the joint session of both the Houses. The NDA MLAs moved into the well of the assembly raising slogans against the government as soon as the House assembled for the day. Even as Speaker Sadanand Singh announced the commencement of question hour, the NDA MLAs entered the well of the House raising slogans like â€œLathi goli ki sarkar, nahi chalegi, nahi chalegiâ€�.

The CPI(ML) members also entered the well demanding action against the junior minister for agriculture for allegedly killing their party worker in Siwan. Interestingly, the first question on the agenda of the House was on a series of â€œfakeâ€� police encounters in the state. The Speaker had to adjourn the House till 12 noon. When the House reassembled, the NDA leaders asked the Speaker about their adjournment motion. The Speaker stressed that the adjournment motion could not be taken up before the motion of thanks on the governorâ€™s speech.

However, leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi , quoting experts on parliamentary proceedings, said that there was a precedence of an adjournment motion being taken up on the very day of the Presidentâ€™s address.

He was supported by the leaders of Samata Party and JD(U) groups, Umashankar Prasad Singh and Ganesh Prasad Yadav respectively. CPI(ML) MLA Raja Ram Singh stressed that the Speaker must use his discretion and allow the motion because an extraordinary situation prevails in the state where innocent people are being killed by the police. Parliamentary affairs minister Ram Chandra Purbey opposed the move, saying that the opposition was free to raise these issues during the debate on the motion of thanks.

The Speaker rejected the adjournment motion, which led to disruption in the proceedings again followed by adjournment of the House till the post-lunch period. In the post-lunch session of the assembly, proceedings continued to be disrupted. Amidst the din, Dasai Choudhary and Vinod Kumar Yadavendu initiated the process for vote of thanks on the governorâ€™s address before the House was adjourned. Speaking to mediapersons, Modi said the opposition did not raise the matter during the question hour because it wanted the adjournment motion to be approved. â€œThe adjournment motion is like a censure motion against the government,â€� he remarked.

8,India to raise harassment issue with Malaysian minister,"NEW DELHI: Awaiting a response from the Malaysian government on the issue of the ill-treatment of Indian nationals, India is likely to use the opportunity of the ongoing visit of a Malaysian minister to make its point.

Mohammed Nazri Abdul Aziz, Malaysia''s minister for entrepreneurial development, who is currently in India, will be told in no uncertain terms about the Indian sentiments on the harassment of its nationals.

Aziz is expected to meet commerce minister Arun Jaitley and textiles minister Kanshiram Rana late on Tuesday evening and will call on HRD minister on Wednesday.

The external affairs ministry spokesperson said India''s shock and displeasure would be conveyed to the visiting minister.

Indian high commissioner in Malaysia Veena Sikri was in touch with the Malaysian government, he said.

Revised figures indicate that 270 persons were rounded up 195 of whom were later formally arrested by the police. All except 10 had been released by Sunday but four remained in the custody of the Malaysian authorities.

Officials said the high-handed behaviour was uncalled for and emphasised that they could not go back to business as usual after an event of this kind.

9,BJP meet may discuss advancing of LS elections,"NEW DELHI: The BJP''s central office-bearers and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani will meet at party president Venkaiah Naidu''s residence on Wednesday morning to discuss two key issues.

Party sources said on Tuesday that they will discuss whether the government should consider advancing the parliamentary polls, holding them by the end of the year, if the BJP performs well in the coming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Delhi, all currently held by the Congress.

The feeling in the party is that the Vajpayee government has completed five years in power, starting with his 1998 stint, and it would be better to strike sooner rather than later.

The second issue concerns the fate of Union rural development minister Shanta Kumar. The sources said that while the PM is inclined to retain him in his cabinet, Advani and Naidu want him to be dropped because of the latter''s remarks about former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal who led the BJP to a defeat in that state recently.

After the results came in, Kumar had said that the BJP in that state had failed to fulfil the ""promises"" it had made to the people. With Advani and Naidu convinced that the differences between Kumar and Dhumal had caused the debacle, this remark was not taken kindly.

Moreover, Kumar had been one of the few people in the party to openly criticise Gujarat CM Narendra Modi in the wake of the communal violence in that state. If Advani and Naidu, who are not satisfied with Kumar''s explanation about his remarks, succeed in convincing the PM that he should be dropped, then there is the possibility of a minor cabinet reshuffle later this week after Parliament goes into recess on March 13.

There is also the issue of the return of the Trinamul Congress'' Mamata Banerjee. At a recent meeting among Vajpayee, Advani and Naidu, the PM had spoken of bringing in Mamata and the National Conference''s Farooq Abdullah. But Mamata''s name had not found favour with Advani, who was soon after visited by her rival Sudip Bandopadhyaya, putting forward his claim as well.

Claiming that the government is ""sensitive to the inconvenience caused to the members of public on account of security arrangement made for VIPs and visiting foreign dignitaries"", the ministry said in a statement issued on Tuesday: ""The guidelines of the government in this regard are very clear.""

According to it, the guidelines made provision for special care to be taken ""to regulate traffic and divert it to alternative routes during the movement of carcades of protected persons. The stoppage of traffic for giving passage to the protected persons is done for very few protectees/visiting foreign dignitaries whose threat level is very high.""

A senior home ministry official said that the ministry was working out a drill to further ""minimise public inconvenience"".

The home ministry statement came a day after thousands of people, including students on their way to give their school board examinations, in neighbouring Ghaziabad were reportedly inconvenienced as traffic was diverted/stopped since Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani was attending the CISF raising day function there.
