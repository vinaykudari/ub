3,IT's party time again for Veecees,"NEW DELHI: With product development activity on the road to revival in the country, many international venture funds are planning to set up shop in the country, close to where all the action is.

The infotech crash in 2000, coupled with an overall slow down in the sector had forced the exit of most of these funds from the country.

This time, however, it is becoming clear that product development has also received an impetus because of an increasing number NRIs from Silicon Valley making their way back to India.

Shamini Dhana, senior vice-president and director of Silicon Valley Bank, with assets of $4.5 billion, said that about 20-25 per cent of its customer base in US had their operations in India.

Boosted by this, she said, the bank is planning to start its India operation in Banglore in the next 6 to 12 months.

Besides India, the bank is also planning to set up its offices in London to look after its European operations and in Shanghai for the Chinese market.

She said that India had emerged as the most favoured destination to carry out product development activities because of the easy availability of trained manpower. India, she added, was also favoured because of its lower cost advantage.

Dhana, who was a participant at Tiecon India 2003, said that its was increasingly clear in global markets that if a company wanted to develop a product at a competitive cost, it must have an operation in India.

""It was the same for Israel in late nineties,"" she said. ""Financing institutions like bank and venture funds followed the place where product development happens in large numbers.""

Earlier, she said, after Silicon valley in US, Israel was the happening place for the product development. ""But, with NRIs from the US coming back, the stage has shifted to India.""

Ellen Levy, director of the $300-million venture fund NeoCarta Ventures, echoes a similar sentiment. She says that almost all of the companies which had financial assistance from her company had an India operation.

She said that with activities picking up over the last one year, her company was also considering its own India operation.

Sanjay Anandram, managing director, Jumpstartup Fund Advisors, said that a lot of US-based companies, which were started by Indians, have also shifted their base to India.

This was significant, he says, adding that with most of these companies already being funded by VCs, the VCs are also shifting their area of operation to India.

Clearly, says Dhana, services activities like call centres, MTs and business process outsourcing firms (BPOs) are no more the area of interests for VCs. The focus is shifting, se says, to the creation of intellectual property.

President of Tie New Delhi and trustee of global board, Saurabh Srivastava said that venture fund activities are on the rise. He said that in 2003, funds worth around $900 million were disbursed.

With NRIs returning, IT product development activities were once gain gaining momentum and this, he said, had increased venture fund requirements. This would increase VC activity in India next year, he said.

4,Six arrested in crackdown on illicit fuel racket,"PUNE: Acting on a tip-off, the district supply officers, state vigilance officers and the rural police on Sunday busted an illicit fuel supply racket at Kunjirwadi in Loni-Kalbhor. Nine tankers, 22 barrels and one motorcycle were seized in the operation. While six persons were arrested, three managed to escape.

The Loni-Kalbhor police said the barrels contained blue kerosene, nafta and other chemicals and the drivers were mixing them at an isolated place in Kunjirwadi.

The solvent obtained after mixing the chemicals was being used as fuel, the officials said. Of the nine tankers seized, eight contained the solvent, the police said, adding that the material seized was worth around Rs 82 lakh.

The operation was supervised by senior police officials from the rural police, Haveli tehsildar Sampatrao Davkar and district supply officer Sambhaji Chavan. The operation, which started at 3 am, ended around 5 pm on Sunday.

The six arrested have been identified as Ramesh Soraj (35), Ramashankar Mishra (43), Ramesh Pande (46), Gajahit Yadav (24), Lalji Chavan (26) and Rameshkumar Harjan (18), all residents of Ghatkopar in Mumbai.

The police have not ruled out the possibility of a bigger racket. Descriptions of those who managed to escape have been sent to other police stations.

One of the main suspects, identified as Shailendra Singh, is among those who managed to escape, the police added.

The police suspect that the mixing was going on for some time. The accused used to get the contents from Mumbai, mix them in a remote area and then sell it.

The police said the tankers are owned by K.K Singh and AvdeshKumar Singh, both residents of Mulund in Mumbai. The role of the tanker owners is being probed, along with the places and people to whom the fuel was being sold.

5,LIC net seller since start of current boom,"MUMBAI: Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has been a net seller on the bourses since the start of the current rally. This is a major departure for the country''s largest insurer, which has been a net buyer over the last few years.

""In the current fiscal, while LIC has bought shares of around Rs 3,000 crore, it sold shares worth Rs 5,100 crore. This amounts to net sales of around Rs 2,100 crore during the year,"" said LIC managing director RN Bhardwaj.

""We have traditionally been contrarions. While foreign institutional investors bought, we chose to sell,"" he added. Similarly, the insurance major had been on a buying spree over the last three years when the equity markets were on a downward spiral.

A senior LIC official said its contrarion approach to the market has lent a certain amount of stability to the Indian bourses. If LIC chose to follow the lead of FIIs â€” buying when they bought and selling when they sold â€” the equity markets would have seen significant volatility, he added.

LIC''s total equity portfolio, when valued at cost of acquisition, is currently at around Rs 24,000 crore. However, if this is on a marked-to-market basis, the total equity portfolio will be worth around Rs 41,000 crore.

""Since our investments were made over a reasonably long period of time, our average cost of acquisition is not very high,"" said Bhardwaj. At present, LIC holds close to 10 per cent of the equity capital of a host of Sensex stocks, which result in a substantial dividend income.

Over the last one year, LIC has also increased its trading portfolio by almost three times, close to Rs 1,500 crore from around Rs 500 crore, added Bhardwaj.

However, it has not set any target level for its trading portfolio. The size of the insurance company''s trading portfolio would depend on market conditions.

This allows policy-holder to make premium payments through Corporation Bank''s automated teller machines (ATMs).
