0,Srivastava aide arrested,"BANGALORE: Fazal-ur-Rahman, a key member of the Babloo Srivastava gang, was on Sunday arrested in New Delhi. Rahman is a wanted man in Bangalore for five years now, in connection with an attempt to kidnap the son of a Hubli-based industrialist, R.N. Shetty. ""We will seek his custody soon"", the city police said here on Monday, on getting news of Rahman''s arrest.

Fazal-ur-Rahman, the main accused in the case, had made two unsuccessful bids to kidnap Shetty''s son and seek ransom later.

The city police, who investigated the Hubli case at the behest of then chief minister J.H. Patel, have already arrested five persons, including the son of a former MLC of Bihar, and the crime reporter of an Urdu daily from Patna.

However, Rahman remained elusive.

Srivastava, who is serving a jail term, is also an accused in the case. The police are yet to get his custody.

1,Chief secretary arrested,"PATNA: In an unprecedented move, the Patna High Court on Monday placed chief secretary K A H Subramanian under judicial custody for his ""objectionable behaviour"" in the courtroom.

He was released from judicial custody after more than two hours on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10,000 with two sureties of the like amount each.

Annoyed by Subramanian''s ""objectionable behaviour"", a single bench presided over by Justice R S Garg remanded him to jail.

But on the intervention of senior advocate Binod Kanth, Justice Garg granted bail to Subramanian on the condition that he would be present in the court positively at 2.15 pm on Tuesday and that if he does not ""behave properly"" and creates an ""ugly scene"" on Tuesday, his bail would be cancelled.

As summoned by the court, Subramanian had appeared in connection with a contempt of court matter for not complying with an HC order of December 4 for the appointment of a regular director in the science and technology department by the government after removing Dhruv Prasad who had been made director on ad hoc basis.

While hearing the case filed by Ram Krit Singh, Justice Garg directed Subramanian to decipher the ""noting"" made by him on the file given to the court.

Subramanian told the court that as he had taken some eye-drops, he was having some difficulty in reading. The judge said the court hour would end at 4.15 pm, but he was ready to wait till 5 pm for him to decipher his ""noting"" on the file.

Subramanian, who felt humiliated, said he was not an ordinary man, rather the chief secretary of the Bihar government. ""You can pass any order you like. You can even send me to jail, and I am ready to go to jail too,"" he stated.

""Which jail?"" the judge asked. ""Any jail,"" Subramanian replied. At this, the judge ordered for taking him into judicial custody immediately. He was taken into custody around 3.30 pm.

When Justice Garg was dictating the order, Kanth intervened ""as a member of the bar"" and submitted that he should not be remanded to jail considering his ill health.

Justice Garg was reluctant to grant bail to Subramanian, stating that for this he would have to file a bail petition before a division bench.

But later, the judge asked Subramanian whether he was in favour of bail or jail. When he apologetically said ""bail"", the judge granted him bail.

4,Ticket to inconvenience at railway station Mandar,"PUNE: A staff crunch has hit the computerised reservation centre at Pune railway station, with only a few of the 30 windows at the facility functioning on any given day.

With limited options, long queues of passengers have become a common sight at the centre and ticket-procuring a time-consuming affair. A commuter, Prasad Vadapalli, said a majority of the windows are either closed or do not have staff during working hours. ""As a result, there is a huge rush at the handful of windows which remain open. People have no choice but to wait in serpentine queues for long hours. When we complained, rail officials refused to take responsibility, saying they were short-staffed.""

A spot visit on Thursday revealed that six of the windows were closed and eight were without staff. Ditto was the scene at the adjoining current booking office, where only six of the 10 windows were open. A reservation office staffer said the Pune division was carved out two years ago, but the authorities have still to increase its staff strength.

""Staffers are shifted from one window to the other and are overworked,"" he said. The situation is no different at the other computerised railway ticket booking centres in the city â€” Shankarsheth road, Raviwar Peth, Shivajinagar, Chinchwad, Khadki, Bootee Street and Deccan Gymkhana. Pune division spokesman Suhas Lohakare told TNN on Friday that there were 120 employees at the computerised booking offices in the city.

""We have closed some windows at the Pune station reservation centre, but 14 windows are always open,"" he claimed. Pune Railway Pravasi Group president Harsha Shah blamed the railway officials for neglecting passenger convenience. ""A number of employees have been shifted from computerised reservation centres to the divisional manager''s office,"" she claimed. Shah said five windows at the Pune station computerised reservation office had been perpetually closed for the past decade.

""The windows have been closed due to the obstruction caused by the concrete pillars at the centre,"" she said. Also, despite repeated demands, the authorities have not bothered to instal coach position signboards, digital display boards and reservation chart boards on platforms and have not repaired the electronic display board near the booking office, Shah said.

Ambarish Baliga, vice-president of Kaary Stock broking attributed the surge to fresh round of buying by new FIIs. FIIs are buying ''India'' not specific stocks, so the valuation comes as a secondary issue, he commented.

But Sri Sankar, a portfolio consultant advised caution. He said the rise is a function of the momentum of the market with commodity prices moving northwards. He said this is time to go to the drawing board and assess the valuation of individual stocks.

Mumtaz Ansari, a resident of Salatnagar Ambika Mills told the commission that police inspector Modi instigated mobs from Maninagar to attack the Muslims of her area. â€œThe inspector directed that petrol be taken out from his vehicle and it was used by the mob to set our society on fire.

While mob pelted stones, threw acid bulbs and crude bombs, RAF men entered houses to look for the menfolk and assaulted women,â€� said Sabina Sheikh. â€œThough I had a fractured leg after the police beat me up earlier, they made obscene gestures and sexually assaulted me and banged my head onto the wall,â€� she added.

12,'Aasha' of suicide helpline waning,"CHANDIGARH: The brouhaha surrounding setting up of Aasha, the round-the-clock suicide helpline, has boiled down to nought. Six months since UT Administration approved its creation, Aasha is yet to see the light of day.

Government Medical College and Hospitalâ€™s psychiatry department, which was assigned the task of running it, now says Aasha could start functioning by February 2004. Ask department head Prof B S Chavan about the delay, he says: â€˜â€˜It was decided to recruit staff needed to make the helpline functional through contract. For this, we had turned to a contractor who supplies manpower.

He, however, did not have the panel of candidates we were looking for which caused the delay.â€� Giving the assurance that Aasha was on course, he says, â€˜â€˜We are seriously concerned and would make it functional as soon as we have the staff. We have put up notices at different places in PGI and Panjab University asking suitable candidates to contact the contractor.â€™â€™

He appears hopeful that the staff would be in place by December-end. â€˜â€˜If we have the staff by the end of this month, they would undergo one month training in January and the helpline would start functioning by February. The infrastructure is in place,â€� he observes. The staff requirement includes three counsellors, two staff nurses and one social worker. Child psychologists, however, appear worried.

â€˜â€˜As it happens every year, there is a rise in number of suicide cases beginning this time of the year. Children are under more stress and the anxiety to farewell in examinations weighs heavy on their minds. Parents often put their wards under acute stress and fearing that they might not be able to live up to their parents expectations, children often contemplate extreme steps which can prove fatal.

Had the helpline been functional now, it would have gone a long way in managing crisis situations,â€� notes a PGI faculty. In view of the incessant delay in starting the helpline, a cross-section of senior doctors feel that the project should have been handed over to PGI which is already running â€˜Childlineâ€™ round-the-clock for the last two years. Close to 25,000 distress calls have been made to the helpline. â€˜â€˜Childline is being run by counsellors.

All that was needed to make the suicide helpline functional from PGI was to appoint a few additional trained staff and maintain direct liaison with NGOs and psychiatry departments of hospitals.

The cost factor could also have been cut down as there wouldnâ€™t have been a need for getting dedicated phone lines,â€� notes a psychiatrist. A senior PGI doctor points out to another fact. â€˜â€˜Another NGO is setting up a similar helpline. What is the need for duplicating the service? Efforts should be made instead to rope them into Aasha and utilise their services for making it functional at the earliest,â€� she says.
