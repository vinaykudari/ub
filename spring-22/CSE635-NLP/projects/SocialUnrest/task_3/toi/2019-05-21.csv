0,Sugar lobby seeks govt’s help,"Mumbai: Sugar barons who are worried about the effects of economic reforms on the sector have asked the state government for protection from competition.

The sugar cooperative, which has traditionally played an active in state politics, has been adversely affected by the Union governmentâ€™s move to delicense the sector. For instance, the lobby is worried about the growing number of sick sugar units in the state.

â€œWe have decided to accept the situation as is and take remedial measures, including governmental intervention,â€™â€™ a sugar lobby member told TNN on Monday. â€œMaharashtraâ€™s politics depend on the sugar industry. Hence, there is nothing wrong to rope in the government which belongs to us,â€™â€™ he said.

This decision was taken at an industry meet presided over by NCP president Sharad Pawar last week. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh was also present at the meet, which was held at Aarey Colony, Goregaon. Representatives of the Maharashtra Rajya Sahakari Sakhar Sangh, which is the controlling body of the sugar cooperatives, the state cooperative banks and secretaries of various state departments discussed plans to salvage the sugar industry. Mr Deshmukh announced that the state would appoint a committee to look into the revival of ailing units.

The sugar cooperative also decided to ask the state government not to permit any new sugar factory for the next five years. The state government has reportedly assured this.

Over the past few years, the Union government has been liberalising the sugar industry despite protests from the Maharastra sugar lobby. The appeal to the state government is the sugar lobbyâ€™s attempt to salvage the situation. For instance, the Maharashtra governmentâ€™s decision of not allowing any new sugar factories, either in cooperative or in private sectors, is against the spirit of liberalisation. As the state government is not left with any role in permitting private factories, it was suggested at the meeting that no infrastructural facilities should be made available for new private units. Mr Deshmukh said the government would consider a proposal to grant concessions for sugar export.

The state government readiness to bail out the sugar barons stems from the fact that industry makes a huge contribution to the state exchequer. The state industry, which provides employment to 1 lakh people, has an annual turnover of over Rs 12,000 crore. It contributes over Rs 2,000 crore every year to the state exchequer and Rs 400 crore to the Centre by way of taxes. Maharashtra produces nearly 40 per cent of Indiaâ€™s sugar.

1,"BSF firing kills one, triggers protests","SRINAGAR: There were violent protests in Baramulla district and Srinagar following the alleged killing of an auto-rickshaw driver in firing by a BSF Jawan and a custodial death on Monday. Security personnel had to use batons to disperse agitators, said sources. Raising anti-BSF slogans, people took to the streets at Sarafkadal. The protests soon spread to adjoining Bohrikadal, Habbakadal and Fatehkadal localities where people indulged in stone throwing. In the interior parts of the city, shops and business establishments remained closed in protest. Even though the BSF said it was â€˜â€˜accidental fireâ€™â€™ which killed the driver, it has ordered an inquiry and detained the accused personnel in its camp in Sarafkadal. Violent demonstrations were also held in Sumbal area of Baramulla where about a hundred people carried the body of a youth who they alleged died in the custody of the Special Operations Group. The youth was picked up from his paddy fields five days back by the SOG and his body was returned to his relatives on Monday.

2,Govt has not done much for farmers: Pillai,"KOCHI: The United Democratic Front (UDF) government in the state could not do much in the agriculture sector and in generating employment opportunities, in its one-year rule, due to the financial problems, Kerala Congress (B) chairman and former electricity minister R Balakrishna Pillai said on Monday.

He told a press conference here after the executive committee meeting of the party that the agricultural sector in the state was facing serious problems due to the steep fall in prices of cash crops. Even the packages announced for the agriculture sector could not be given due to the financial crunch, he said.

Pointing out that the money earmarked for the agriculture sector was not reaching the farmer, he said the government should take steps to see that the money reached the farmers directly.

He said the state government should seek assistance from the Centre as was done by the neighbouring Tamil Nadu.

Pillai said his party was not in favour of disinvestment of public sector units.

3,"No ordinance, but bill on labour policy soon","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala government has shelved the plan to issue an ordinance on the new labour policy.

Instead, it will introduce a bill in the monsoon session of the Assembly beginning June 12, Chief Minister A K Antony said here on Monday.

A discussion with all concerned will be held on May 29, he said.

The new policy seeks to curb the ""arbitrary powers"" of the trade unions which is believed to be the single most important reason driving away investors from Kerala. The existing labour law disallows police intervention in labour disputes which gives a free hand to unions. The government bid to amend labour laws had met with stiff resistance from the Left-oriented unions.

4,Activists slaughter govt’s plan,"Mumbai: Animal rights activists have cut up in small pieces the Planning Commissionâ€™s proposals in the Tenth Five Year Plan for the animal husbandry sector.

Terming the report pro- slaughter, the organisations said in a press release that they were outraged to find that industrialists who owned slaughterhouses and ran private corporate empires in meat production and export had been chosen to be on the advisory committee of the Planning Commission.

They have condemned recommendations such as lifting of ban on beef export, removing restrictions on buffalo slaughter, taking off the age ceiling for bullock slaughter, weakening prevention of cruelty to animals acts, setting up abattoirs, diluting local bodiesâ€™ right to oppose slaughter by making it a state issue and spending crores of rupees on setting up a Meat Board.

â€œHow can the same government run an Animal Welfare Board and a Meat Board?â€™â€™ said Gauri Maini Hira of People for Animals, Bangalore. Groups from all over Indiaâ€” Beauty Without Cruelty, Theosophical Society, Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals, Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Mata Rukminidevi Ashram, Viniyog Parivar Trust and PETA (India)â€”have united in protest.

â€œMeat is consumed since pre-historic times and holds a very special position in the human nutrition,â€™â€™ says the Planning Commission subgroupâ€™s report, adding, â€œThe present availability of animal protein in Indian diet is 10g, as against world average of 25g, and this needs to be increased two fold.â€™â€™

Among advantages, the report supporting nutrition for a large category of agricultural and weaker sections, creating new employment opportunities, conserving livestock resources, export earnings and meeting the balance of payments.

Among the many phrases the animal welfare groups have objected are â€œmechanised slughterhouses of social requirementâ€™â€™, where â€œanimals are made comfortableâ€™â€™. Besides, activists have run the marker over suggestions like â€œa serious effort is required to practice higher slaughter ratesâ€™â€™, â€œpork products industry has to developâ€™â€™ and â€œculling of unproductive and surplus animals and their utilisation is an essential basis of scientific production of animalsâ€™â€™.

However, they rate this as the most ludicrous of all: â€œ...process chicken under aesthetic conditions.â€™â€™

5,Kerala BJP resents Sinha's praise of UDF rule,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP''s Kerala unit president C K Padmanabhan on Monday expressed resentment over Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha''s reported praise of the reform process set in motion by the UDF government in the state, saying ""it only betrayed a class characteristic common to ministers in times of liberalisation.""

""In times of liberalisation ministers tend to approach issues like chartered accountants. You need to take encomiums showered on the UDF government by sinha in that spirit,"" he told a meet-the-press here.

The performance of the UDF government headed by A K Antony in its first year in office was ""nothing but a procession of breach of promises,"" he said.

""The government is led by bureaucrats, rendering the rule insensitive to people''s problems and sentiments.""

The Chief Minister personally has an unblemished record, which, Padmanabhan said, was not the sole indicator of good governance. The government had shied away from stern action against corruption, including an effective investigation into alleged irregularities in the allocation of plus-two courses to schools by the previous LDF government, he said.

The size of the ministry itself contradicted the UDF''s claim that it was committed to pruning administrative expenses in all spheres.

Padmanabhan demanded a CBI probe into the issue of encroachment of forest land in Mathikettanmala and said he would lead a march in Idukki district from May 26 to 31 demanding action on the matter. (PTI)

8,Service rules to be amended,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government has decided to amend the Punjab Service of Engineers class II, Public Works Department (Building and Roads) Rules, 1965 on the demand of the diploma engineersâ€™ association so as to maintain 25 per cent promotion quota amongst the subdivisional engineers from among junior engineers at all levels.

9,Killing puts Punjab govt in a spot,"CHANDIGARH: The Bhikhiwind killings have squarely put the state government in the dock.

Besides the naming of irrigation minister Gurchet Singh Bhullar in the FIR, the most significant aspect that the government would find difficult to address is the use of officials arms in the killings.

Official reports affirm that the three arms, AK-47, SLR and nine mm gun were used by the accused to gun down six persons, including Gurdial Singh, who had contested on the SAD ticket in the last Vidhan Sabha election.

The investigations, so far, have not confirmed where from did the criminals procure these weapons. Officials here do not rule out the possibility of the criminals borrowing them from police personnel. They feel that it would not be possible for the criminals to procure all the weapons privately.

Another factor that the government Punjab govt in government would find difficult to compromise is the unusual delay in registering an FIR, which reportedly allowed the supporters of the victims to pressurise the police to incorporate names of persons who were not present on the scene.

According to official reports, it took more than 10 hours for the police to register the FIR, which allowed the complainants to twist the facts suitably.

It is learnt that while one vehicle was involved in the crime, the complainants insisted that the number of vehicles be put to two. According to an eyewitness account available here with officials, name of the minister has also been reportedly dragged in the FIR as an afterthought.

Incidentally, all the six persons named in the FIR are from one family on Algon Kothi village indicating clearly that the crime has personal and political overtones.

Among the accused while Bakshish Singh and Major Singh are in a spot brothers, rest of the four accused, Dalbir Singh, Jasbir Singh, Surjit Singh and Inderjit Singh, are their sons.

The incident is being linked to the running feud that the prime accused, Shamsher, had with Gurdial Singh. In 1997, Gurdial had accused Bakshish of making an attempt on his life. Two years later Bakshish was also booked under the Arms Act, purportedly at the behest of Gurdial Singh.

Another incident being linked to the killings is the murder of a person that took place in March this year near Patti. While one of the accused, Joginder Singh, had been arrested whereas rest of the accused went scot free allegedly due to the patronage of the minister.

As the case is likely to assume serious political overtones for the Amarinder Singh government and also since a minister has been named in it, the government is believed to be seriously contemplating about referring it to the CBI.

10,Health minister locks horns with Lok Ayukta,"SHIMOGA: The words and actions of the Lok Ayukta against government doctors and hospital services will demoralise the staff, said Health minister Dr A B Malaka Raddy.

He was inaugurating the 20th state-level conference of the Government Doctors'' Association in Shimoga on Saturday.

Raddy was critical of Lok Ayukta N Venkatachala''s remarks on inefficiency of the government hospital staff. The latter visited various district hospitals in the state and had commented about the ""inefficiency and corruption'''' prevalent in the hospitals.

Raddy said poor facilities, an upshot of meagre allocation of funds to the health sector, can be condemned from the idealistic standpoint. ``But when the failure is due to financial constraints, this sort of criticism is not fair. On the other hand, this will only demoralise the workforce,"" he said.

The minister referred to the fact that only one per cent of the GNP was allocated for the health sector in the country. This is in start contrast to the 15-20 per cent spent in various neighbouring countries.

Citing an example of Bantwal Hospital in South Canara which the Lok Ayukta visited, the minister said the hospital used to conduct operations for 100 cases a week. Now the number has come down to a mere three. ``Unless we provide adequate funds, personnel and quality service to the health sector, even hundreds of Lok Ayuktas cannot improve the system or service.''''

Raddy rejected outright the suggestion to take out health service maintenance from the preview of zilla panchayats and local bodies in the state.

11,"Now, a card to monitor trucks","BANGALORE: Truck owners and transport companies can rejoice. A new system will allow them to keep track of where their trucks are, if there has been an accident, if drivers have fallen sick or if the vehicle is stuck at any checkpost or State border. All this with the swipe of a card.

Asiaonwheels, a Hyderabad-based company, will launch its national truck tracking services in June, says the company''s Zonal Partner for Karnataka, Uday Bhaskar B.

Data Collection Units (DCU) based on a modem will be set up at various points on highways where a truck-driver would normally stop -- dhabas and tea-stalls, apart from STD booths and checkposts. Each subscriber driver will have a chip card. The driver can stop at any number of DCUs on his long-winding route say from Coimbatore to Srinagar to let the owner of the truck know where he is.

The information can be accessed by the person who sends the consignment or is expecting it also, either directly on the company website or calling the nearest franchisee. Once he inserts the card in the DCU, his current location is automatically known. By punching in a code, the message is sent -- `Reached safely'', `Paper problem on Andhra border'', `Accident occurred'' and so on. The franchisee nearest to the spot will co-ordinate help.

``Initially the company will connect to the highways between the four metros and then move out into other places,'''' says Bhaskar.

This year their target is to set up 40 area franchisees in Karnataka. These AFs will have a computer with an internet connection and will keep track of the DCUs in their district. Bangalore, Mangalore, Dharwad/Hubli and Bellary will be the places they will concentrate on first in Karnataka.

Each card is priced at Rs 300. And depending on whether the truck has a state, neighbouring state or all-India permit, a renewable monthly fee of Rs 150, 250 or 400 will be charged per truck. The company also provides insurance through a tie-up with Alliance Bajaj.

12,East Delhi MLAs pressure govt on power cuts,"NEW DELHI: Delhi state power minister Ajay Maken assured speedy response and better coordination at the local level during a review meeting of the power situation in east Delhi on Monday.

Several areas of east Delhi have been in the grip of a power and water crisis for the last couple of days.

â€˜â€˜There has been a lot of talk on responsiveness of the Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) employees at the local level. It has been felt that their responsiveness and the time taken to respond to a complaint needs to be addressed,â€™â€™ Maken said, soon after coming out of the meeting which was convened by Delhi state chief minister Sheila Dikshit and attended by several legislators.

Sources said that DVB employees at the local level are going through an enhanced degree of â€˜uncertaintyâ€™. â€˜â€˜The lower level staff is a bit jittery about their fate after privatisation. So they are not very responsive to the grievances of residents,â€™â€™ a power department source said.

Maken said that his personal visits to the complaint centres will help in reducing the uncertainty and raise the motivation levels of the employees. â€˜â€˜Our appreciation letters and chargesheets both should improve the responsiveness of the staff at the lower level,â€™â€™ Maken said.

DVB officials are at present preparing a comprehensive table on the response time taken to address and rectify every type of fault in the distribution network. â€˜â€˜Apart from the time needed to rectify the faults, the responsibility of the concerned employee shall also be fixed to ensure that buck-passing does not occur,â€™â€™ the minister said.

Chief engineers of the DVB have now been asked to comment on the response time and onus-fixing within the Board on various categories of faults.

The east Delhi legislators â€” 11 Congress and three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs â€” sought immediate redressal to their local power and water problems as they complained of constraints.

Former health minister and BJP MLA Harshvardhan said: â€˜â€˜The CM has been accusing us of shedding crocodile tears at the residentsâ€™ complaints of power and water shortage. But even the Congress MLAs have vigorously complained about both problems at the meeting. Both the chief minister and power minister should realise that the ground situation is indeed bad.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜MLAs are complaining that their complaints are not heeded by engineers and local staff manning the complaint centres. We plan to improve their coordination,â€™â€™ he said.

13,30 MCC activists arrested,"PATNA: In an early morning swoop on Monday in Shivrampur village under Baheri police station of Darbhanga district, the police overpowered 30 activists of the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and seized seven weapons after a brief face-off between the MCC and the raiding police party.

The weapons seized included two self-loading rifles and one sten carbine, which were earlier looted from the Pahsaul police picket under Katra police station of Muzaffarpur district. The police picket was manned by the jawans of the BMP-6, Muzaffarpur. Among other weapons seized were two DBBL guns, two regular rifles, 102 cartridges and vindolia. The police also seized Maoist literature.

Following a tip-off that the MCC men had assembled in the village to participate in the marriage of the daughter of an ex-area commander of the outfit, Shiv Sunderlal Das, who was earlier killed in Jehanabad during police action, Darbhanga SP Sudhanshu Kumar led a police party and cordoned off the detailed place.

IG (operations) Neelmani said the police, in fact, did not intend to disturb the marriage and waited till around 4.30 am to carry out the raid. The house where the MCC men had assembled was heavily surrounded by the police.

When the police decided to conduct search operations to flush out the extremists, the latter fired three shots. The police retaliated cautiously so that innocent people, participating in the marriage ceremony, did not come in the firing line.

Realising the strength of the police force, the MCC men immediately gave in. In all, 30 MCC men, including six hardcore ones, were later rounded up.

Neelmani said this is the major catch in Darbhanga after February 17 this year, when two MCC men, including area commander Prakash Mallik, had surrendered before the police in the presence of DGP R R Prasad and minister for road construction Abdul Bari Siddiqui.

15,MSR washes his hands off party feud,"HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president M Satyanarayana Rao washed his hands of the controversy between the Telangana and Andhra leaders within the party, saying that the â€œball is in the high commandâ€™s court.

They need to take a decision before the situation slips out of hand.â€� The Congress Forum for Telangana (CFT) leaders had objected to the proposed meeting of the leaders from the Andhra region on May 22 to discuss the impact of the CFT on the party.

Satyanarayana Rao said the issue should not be prolonged further and the high command should take a decision immediately. He said neither the PCC nor the CLP had a role to play in the current issue.

He complimented the Andhra leaders for their restraint in the face of uncalled for criticism by the CFT leaders. He said the Andhra leaders decided to hold the meeting as they were under pressure from the people in their respective areas, to make their stand clear on the issue.

He said the Andhra leaders had clarified that they were not against the decision of the party high command to demand the second States Reorganisation Committee. He added that the Andhra leaders are likely to take the issue to the notice of the party high command during the All India Congress Committee meeting scheduled for May 24. â€œWe are a totally democratic and transparent party,â€� he said.

17,Statues: Mark of a government,"LUCKNOW: For the dozens of sculptors and artists who have either been out of business or have had their money blocked with statues statues made but not unveiled or installed, the coronation of BSP leader Mayawati as UP chief minister has rekindled hopes of a â€˜better tomorrowâ€™.

Known for her fascination for parks and statues, the CM has virtually overhauled the entire state culture department (with a new principal secretary, new special secretary and a new director) and the department has recently also formed a panel to decide on the future statues and sculptors to be hired.

A sum of Rs 23 lakh has also been released for this purpose, said an official.

According to reliable sources, the department has also been asked to prepare a detailed report on the pending projects and on the number of statues that were announced by Mayawati during her two previous tenures, but have yet to seen the light of the day.

As many as 34 statues in various shapes, sizes and materials are lying with artists.

The list includes five statues made by Shrawan Kumar Prajapati â€” known in bureaucratic circles as the â€˜blue-eyed boyâ€™ of behenji.

Prajapati has contributed immensely to the Ambedkar Memorial and most of the statues of Bhim Rao Ambedkar and the elephants have been made by him. As much as Rs 8.94 lakh owed to Prajapati, is currently unreleased.

The statues, which are yet to be unveiled or to be allotted a suitable place for erecting, include those of former chief minister Veer Bahadur Singh (Lucknow), Raj Narain (Lucknow), Shyam Narain Pandey (Mau), Maharaja Agrasen (Ghaziabad), three statues of Ahilyabai Holkar (Kanpur, Lucknow and Varanasi), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (Azamgarh), Nishadraj Guh (Azamgarh), Sant Raidas (Varanasi), Jharkhandey Rai (Mau) and Jai Bahadur (Mau).

Efforts are on to â€œstreamline the process of getting the statues a place as announced by successive chief ministers,â€� said Premanshu, additional director of the culture department.

The installation of many statues, which were announced by BJP chief ministers like Ram Prakash Gupta, Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh, have also failed to be erected, either due to the change of guard in the state, or the non-availability of funds.

The BJP chief ministers together, officials say, had announced the installation of some 217 statues during their tenures, while Mayawati had announced more than 50, most of which, are in place.

The statues made in cement-concrete, marble and bronze have cost a fortune for the state coffers as the statues cost anything between Rs 30,000 to Rs 10 lakh â€” as per their size and the material used.

Things had come to such a head sometime back, that during Presidentâ€™s rule, it was decided that the government would only pay for statues announced by the chief minister.

For the rest, it was decided that 25 per cent of the total cost would be borne by the person who announced the installation of the statue.

19,No need to wait till Feb for polls: Nath,"AHMEDABAD: In an apparent turnaround in the party''s stance, the All-India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Gujarat Kamal Nath stated on Monday that ""if peace prevailed in the state there was no need to wait till February 2003 to hold the Assembly elections"". He said this figured in the discussions in the general body meeting of the party of the newly-appointed PCC, on Monday morning

Justifying the statement he said, ""it was a question of saving Gujarat and the earlier they bid goodbye to the BJP, the better it was for Gujarat''s progress"". He accused the BJP of surviving on a policy of dividing Gujarat.

Even as Nath was being barraged with questions about the Congress'' sudden readiness to go to the polls, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee president Amarsinh Chaudhary declared the party''s plans to begin the new PCC term by hosting a meeting in the temple town of Somnath some time before June 10. Asked why they were following the BJP''s strategy (LK Advani led a rathyatra from Somnath), Chaudhary told TNN, ""when I became president I had vowed at the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Somnath that I would begin my first party meeting from here"".

Kamal Nath said that it was on account of the Congress'' proposal to effect Article 355 that KPS Gill was moved to Gujarat. ""If they had done it earlier, violence would have stopped a fortnight back"", he said.

When questioned as to what action he would take on those members of the Congress who had met Chief Minister Narendra Modi and were contemplating a switch, he said, ""this is all false propaganda by the BJP and even if it is true, there are several MLAs from the BJP who want to come to the Congress"".

Asked ""who"", he said, ""there are ten of them at least"", but refused to divulge names. Nath, who was accompanied by Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel, also denied of having received any complaints from minority leaders about a change in leadership in the state Congress.

Later, Chaudhary emphasised that several conventions would be held at the district and taluka levels which would be attended by senior leaders like Madhavsinh Solanki, Shankersinh Vaghela, Urmila Patel and himself. He said that the party had planned a major public meeting before June 15 to be addressed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi at Limkheda, strategically chosen for its proximity to the tribal-dominated Dahod, the now infamous Godhra and Madhya Pradesh!

Chaudhary said that meetings would also be held in Junagadh, Surat, Dumas and other areas of Central and North Gujarat as a preparatory to the Assembly elections which were eight months away.

Asked why the party had suddenly changed its stance on the elections, Nath said, ""we are not in a hurry, it is they (the BJP) which said that they wanted early polls and we are saying that we are ready as soon as normalcy prevails and people return from the camps"".

21,Reality bytes catch up with chief minister,"Kolkata: â€œPlease get us a job of a peon or a driver so that we can return to West Bengal,â€� pleaded a goldsmith from Mumbai.

He had called up the Doordarshan studio here to plead with the chief minister himself. Bengalis like him in Mumbai, he said, were being tortured by the police who thought they were all from Bangladesh.

Similar pleas were made by a telecom engineer from Bangalore and another engineer from Ambala during the one and a half hour long programme on DD, Bangla, in the hundredth episode of Jukti,Takko, Gappo.

They were forced to leave the state in search of employment. Can the CM please generate opportunities so that they could return ?

â€œWe are trying our utmost (aamra aapraan cheshta korchi),â€� said the chief minister to virtually every question. By the time the programme came to an end, the sentence had lost much of its sheen, if not credibility.

The chief minister was forced to concede that no breakthrough was in sight in Dunlop. He had written to the defence minister though, pointing out that Dunlop made world class tyres. No reply had been received. He was in no position to assure the survival or revival of Indian Iron & Steel Company either. He had reminded the PM though about interests shown by Russian, Japanese and Chinese firms in IISCO. The PM has not got back to him but his government would do its utmost to protect the interests of workers.

Bhattacharjee and the hosts appeared totally unprepared for the grim reality bytes. Nothing that the CM said seemed to enthuse the Santhal from Purulia who had been given land which was uncultivable or the caller from Kolkata who has been waiting for an appointment despite finding a place in the panel for primary school teachers three years ago, or for that matter the blind man, again from Purulia, who had applied for a pension two years ago and has ben waiting ever since.

The hapless Bhattacharjee, asked by villagers to provide primary schools, roads, gyms, water for irrigation and so on, asked them repeatedly from the studio in the city, â€œWhat is the panchayat doing? Have you ap-proached the panchayat?â€� Remarkably, the villagers seemed deaf and maintained studied silence on the question.

24,"Child abuse: Lok Ayukta seeks report from govt, police","BANGALORE: * A 12 year-old boy Altaf in Tumkur was kept in police custody and tortured for 40 days before he was sent to a remand home where he is treated like a criminal, once again.

Lok Ayukta N. Venkatachala has now sought a report from the Department of Women and Child Development (WCD), which is running the remand home and from the police department for detaining the child in custody for over a month in violation of rules.

Sadly, Altaf is not alone. The Lok Ayukta which visited various remand homes for children run by the WCD department has found that these ``homes'''' treat children like criminals.

``We were shocked when we noticed one of the remand homes caretaker in a police uniform, merely to scare the children. The food given is of bad quality. Majority of the staff in these observations homes have no training in counselling children,'''' sources told The Times of India.

When a team from the Lok Ayukta visited the remand home in Tumkur recently, the children narrated the harassment being meted out to them. ``In many cases, the senior officers are unaware of such violations. There is absolutely no supervision of these homes by the concerned departments,'''' sources said.

When Venkatachala verified the police files of these children, the sub-inspector in his report had observed that if children are not punished, they would become thieves or dacoits. ``The Lok Ayukta felt that the report is sufficient to suspend the inspector,'''' sources said.

Tumkur Superintendent of Police R. Hitendra confirmed that the Lok ayukta had ordered an inquiry into the illegal detention of the boy in police custody and sought a report. ``We will inquire and submit the report,'''' he said.

Ironically, after the Gadag episode in March this year, where 14 children in a remand home were locked up and beaten, the WCD had constituted a committee to sensitise hostel wardens on treating children.

WCD Minister C. Motamma said she had asked her department to look into the Lok Ayukta''s allegations. ``Like the Gadag incident in which the superintendent and house-keeper of the remand home were suspended, we will punish the guilty in the Tumkur case too,'''' she added.
