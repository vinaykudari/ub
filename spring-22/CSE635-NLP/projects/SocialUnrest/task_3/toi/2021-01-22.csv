CBI sources said that Chaurasia had also been arrested. Both Singh and Chaurasia would be produced before the court of Special CBI judge, Dhanbad, on Friday.

The raid carried out by the investigating agency at Singh''s Dhanbad residence soon after his arrest revealed that he owned properties worth over Rs 1.5 crore.

The CBI seized over Rs 1.08 crore cash and jewelleries worth Rs.2 lakh during the raid conducted Singh''s his Dhanbad residence. The counting of currency notes, which at 8.30 a.m on Thursday, ended around 9.00 p.m.

The investigating agency had to press into service six bank cashiers to count the currency notes. The counting of currency notes resembled the counting of ballot papers in elections as cash seizure kept mounting up after each round of counting, a CBI official said.

K K Singh had sought favour from Swarn Singh to sort out his income-tax problems which began following a raid conducted at his premises by the investigation wing of the IT in the last week of December 2003. The IT official, according to CBI sources in Ranchi, had demanded Rs.15 lakh from the petrol pump owner to get his work done.

The Rs.1 lakh paid to the IT official by K K Singh through Chaurasia was the first instalment of the payment, sources said. The ADI had detetced a discrepancy of Rs.50 lakh in the return filed by K K Singh, CBI sources added.

The investigating agency had laid a trap to arrest Singh after receiving complaints from K K Singh that IT official had demanded bribe from him to get his work done. The CBI started interrogation of Singh soon after his arrest.

Sources in the CBI said that the estimated cost of Singh''s Dhanbad house would alone be around Rs.20 lakh while the estimated cost of the furniture found in the house was Rs.1.05 lakh. The CBI sleuths also seized documents relating to huge investments worth over Rs.12.5 lakh made by Singh in LIC, UTI, NSC, KVC and FDRs.The estimated cost of the vehicle owned by Singh is Rs.1.50 lakh.

Singh also had two lockers in banks. The investigating has freezed the operation of Singh''s two bank lockers and eight bank accounts. It is likely to open Singh''s two lockers on Friday.

Singh had started his career in the IT department as a stenographer and it was his first posting as the ADI, a post in the rank of assistant commissioner(AC). He was promoted to the rank of AC in the year 2001 and was posted in Dhanbad as ADI in the mid 2002, a top IT official here said.

The arrest of Singh has shocked the senior IT officials here. A top IT official said that Singh could be placed under suspension if he failed to get bail by Saturday evening.

The director general investigation (DGI), IT, Bihar and Jharkhand, L K Singhvi, is learnt to have informed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) about Singh''s arrest.

The DGI will, however, send a formal communication to the CBDT in this regard after receiving details of Singh''s arrest by the CBI and the subsequent raid conducted at his Dhanbad residences.

1,CESC lawyers snatch win hours after adverse order,"KOLKATA: In an unusual development, Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta of Calcutta High Court revised his ruling against CESC in the course of a single day.

CESC officials were shocked on Thursday morning, when they came to know of the Calcutta High Court order, directing the company to restore power to two consumers at Fancy Market.

The ex-parte order was passed by Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta after a plea by the two. Legal eagles from the CESC rushed to the court and made their position clear in the afternoon, after which Justice Sengupta ruled in the power companyâ€™s favour, directing the police to provide all assistance.

CESC had decided to undertake system reorganisation work at the Fancy Market from January 12 and gave notice to the consumers on January 6. When officials arrived at the spot on January 12 to begin work, they were prevented from doing so by a group of consumers.

The officials were forced to return and the CESC served another notice on January 14. This time the company threatened to disconnect power under Section 163 of the Electricity Act, 2003.

The Fancy Market consumers asked the CESC to start work from January 19. However, on the given date, they were again prevented from starting work.

This time the company disconnected power to the market. In an earlier incident, Sk Zaheer and Janab Ansar, two consumers from the market, were hauled up by the CESC for illegal tapping of power.

They had managed to get a restoration order from the court. Using the same order, they filed a contempt petition in Justice Senguptaâ€™s court on Thursday.

As nobody from the CESCâ€™s side was available to submit their side of the story, Justice Sengupta ordered in favour of Zaheer and Ansar, asking the company to restore power immediately.

On getting information, officials from the CESC legal cell rushed to the high court.

After hearing the CESCâ€™s plea that restoration of power was not possible till reorganisation work was completed, Justice Sengupta ruled in favour of the company asking it to begin work.

2,BJP's Gen Next not to contest LS polls,"NEW DELHI: A majority of the BJP''s Gen Next leaders are currently in the Rajya Sabha, and are likely to remain so, even though the coming Lok Sabha polls will provide them with an opportunity to contest elections.Senior party sources say, ""We need most of these leaders to coordinate the campaign, raise funds and manage the elections. We don''t want them tied down to individual constituencies. They are not like our top two leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani who can win their seats without spending much time in their constituencies.""So, for instance, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu â€” set to get a fresh term as president on February 6 â€” will not contest the LS elections. Party sources added that he had taken a vow never to contest an election in his life.After the recent Hyderabad BJP national executive, when Naidu went to celebrate Makar Sankranti with his family in his village in Nellore district, the local media speculated that Naidu''s daughter may contest the Nellore LS seat.Eventually, Naidu''s daughter issued a statement saying she was not going to contest the seat as she neither believed in dynastic politics nor that the political route was the only way to serve the people. She added that her father, too, was not going to contest the elections.Of the party''s five general secretaries, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Anita Arya, both LS MPs, are likely to be renominated.Their names are not among the central leaders who will attend the party''s core group meetings, scheduled between January 24 and February 11, which will work out alliances, candidates for elections and state-specific campaign strategies.Of the other three, Pramod Mahajan, Mukthar Abbas Naqvi amd Sanjay Joshi, the first two are RS members with one term each in the past in the LS. Joshi, however, is the low profile organisational general secretary who has never contested an election.Mahajan, as the BJP''s campaign-in-charge for the LS polls, is unlikely to have the time to contest an election, but his RS term does end in April this year. Personally, too, he is not keen to contest the LS poll.Naqvi, on the other hand, sources said, wants to take a second shot at Rampur in Uttar Pradesh as this would ensure a ministerial berth as he had in the 13-day 1996 government.The other Gen Next leaders who are RS members include law minister Arun Jaitley, parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and agriculture minister Rajnath Singh.",NEW DELHI

4,Leaders rally around fasting RSS stalwart,"AHMEDABAD: Bharatiya Kisan Sangh leaders including national secretary Jivanbhai Patel and former BJP minister Arvind Patel on Thusday extended support to RSS stalwart Laljibhai Patel who has undertaken an indefinite fast from Wednesday near the BJP office to draw attention to the power tariff issue which is agitating farmers.

Jivanbhai and Arvind Patel, who is brother of state industries minister Anil Patel, visited the fasting leader and inquired about his health. This is believed to have created some consternation in the BJP camp.

Jivanbhai Patel told mediapersons that farmersâ€™ agitation would continue till Chief Minister Narendra Modi resigns.

A spokesman for the BKS said that over 100 farmers from Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar units would undertake a token fast on Friday near the BJP office in Laljibhaiâ€™s support.

In a strongly worded statement, Laljibhai alleged that the Modi government had tried to split the BKS ever since it launched its agitation on power tariff hike. â€œThis conspiracy was executed by his confidants like minister of state for home Amit Shah and state BJP general secretary Jayantibhai Barotâ€�, he said.

Patel said it was really unfortunate that Modi who was groomed for this high post by the Sangh Parivar has targeted its frontal organisations one after another since he took over the reins of power in December last year. Modi first targeted the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarathi Parishad for its protest hike in tuition fees.

After that he tried to break up Vidya Bharati and now the BKS for challenging his leadership. â€œModi is a great hypocrite who always insults those who challenge his gimmicks which are totally opposed to the Sangh philosophy,â€� he said.

Bhattacharjee will be in Hyderabad on January 30 to address around 125 CEOs â€” mainly those engaged in the IT, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and agro-based industries â€” to underline the value proposition that West Bengal offers in a host of sectors.

Bhattacharjee is also slated to hold one-on-one meetings with a galaxy of stalwarts, including a possible one with Satyam Computer Services chairman B. Ramalinga Raju. Incidentally, Raju has urged Bhattacharjee to also visit the Satyam campus while the latter is in Hyderabad.

It may be noted that an exploratory team from Satyam â€” Indiaâ€™s fourth largest software and allied services exporter â€” was in Salt Lake last November to find out the prospect of setting up a facility here, following a request made to Raju by the state IT department.

16,SC to consider Mayawati's arrest issue,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on February 13 decide whether the Allahabad high court''s stay on the arrest of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati in Rs 175 crore Taj heritage corridor scam was legal or not.

Former UP''s standing counsel Ajay Agrawal, who has challenged the high court order, said the high court had ""set a bad precedent in criminal jurisprudence by giving a blanket order of stay of arrest during the period of investigation.""

Adjourning hearing till February 13, a Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare, Justices S B Sinha and S H Kapadia granted eight-week time to the Centre to complete departmental inquiry against former Environment Secretary K C Mishra and Chairman of National Projects Construction Corporation (NPCC) S C Bali, accused in the Taj Heritage Corridor Project case.

As Central Pollution Control Board''s counsel Vijay Panjwani said that the CBI has registered the case against Mayawati and other only under the provisions of Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act and had failed to comply with the court''s directive to book them under the Water (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Bench said it would consider the matter next month.

CJI Khare, who perused the CBI status report, said that the agency has considered this issue in the report.

The CBI had submitted the status report in a sealed cover. Justice Sinha said that 60 days was needed to get the government''s sanction to proceed against the accused under the Act. However, Panjwani submitted that a complaint under the Environment (Protection) Act any government official can make a complaint and that can be acted upon.

The court also gave four-week time to Mulayam Singh Yadav government in UP to decide the course of action to be taken against D S Bagga (chief secretary to the Mayawati), P L Punia (her principal secretary) and former state environment secretary V K Gupta after the state advocate general submitted that departmental proceedings have already been completed against these officials as sought by the court.

17,SC notice on selection of senior bureaucrats,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Centre on a PIL challenging the validity of the ""single directive"" in the CVC Act 2003 which aims at granting protection to select senior bureaucrats from outright probe by the CBI into the allegations of corruption against them.

The CBI has to get the government''s prior sanction before initiating probe against bureaucrats in the rank of Joint Secretary or above under the Act.

A Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare, Justices S B Sinha and S H Kapadia asked the Centre to file its reply within four weeks.

The court refused to pass any order on counsel Anil B Divan, who is assisting the court in this matter, to stay the implementation of the CVC Act provision pending scrutiny by the Court.

Attorney general Soli J Sorabjee said that heavens would not fall if the stay was not granted.

Petitioner, Centre for Public Interest Litigation''s counsel Prashant Bhushan sought quashing of Sub Section (c) of Section 26 of the Act, 2003 on the ground that it was violative of fundamental rights of citizens and derogative of the rule of law.

Divan said that after the apex court quashed the controversial provision which is called the ""Single Directive"" in 1997, the Centre had withdrawn a similar provision from the CVC Ordinance in 1998.

The CBI functioned without this restriction for nearly five and a half years, but the said directive has been re-introduced in the new Act, Divan added.

The Government had told the apex court that it had introduced the Bill without the single directive clause but the Joint Parliamentary Committee in its report suggested re-introduction on the ground that ""no protection was available to the persons at the decision-making level"".

Thus, the Centre retained the provision for the officers in the decision-making level saying, it was only a discretionary power.

In its judgment (Hawala case), the apex court had said where accusations of corruption were based on direct evidence CBI did not have to seek prior permission. Even where an inference had to be drawn as to any corrupt motive was behind a decision, the expertise to decide to proceed or not in such cases should be with the CBI itself.

18,Sixth rapist identified; Jaiswal arrested,"AHMEDABAD: Five more persons including Pannalal Jaiswal, owner of the hotel where Bijal Joshi was gang-raped at a New Year eve party, were arrested on Friday by the police which also claimed that there was a sixth rapist involved in the sensational crime.

The mother and sister of one of the accused, Sugam Jaiswal, have also been arrested by the police for destroying evidence.

Police commissioner K R Kaushik said the sixth rapist had been identified as Manish Jain. The crime was committed in two rooms, nos 106 and 205 of Ashok Palace hotel. ""He (Manish) was occupying one of the rooms and we have enough evidence against him,"" asserted Kaushik.

While Manish and another accused, Karan Jain, are still at large, the five who were formally arrested in this case on Friday are Pannalal Jaiswal, his son-in-law Anand Jaiswal, Seema Jaiswal, Shreya Jaiswal and Ashok Patel, an Anand-based dealer of Mahek â€˜gutkhaâ€™. Seema and Shreya are the mother and sister, respectively, of one of the accused, Sugam Jaiswal whose father Harishankar Jaiswal has been named as absconder.

Police said Pannalal, whose sons Chandan and Mandan have been arrested for the gangrape, was responsible for the cleaning up of the room in which the crime was committed. Along with the bed-sheets and blankets, bottles of liquor and glasses were taken away along with other articles and hidden in a flat at the Manibhadra Avenue, situated next to the hotel.

Police said after ensuring that Chandan and Mandan remain in hiding with Ashok Patel in Anand, Pannalal on January 14 took out these articles from the flat and destroyed them. A Santro car that he used to take out the articles has been seized by the cops.

Police said Sugamâ€™s parents and his sister, armed with a duplicate key of the Maruti Zen car that was used to drop Bijal back home after the rape and was lying in Shahibaug police station premises, had managed to steal Bijalâ€™s undergarments, her purse, sandles and a bangles. The evidence was later destroyed.

Countering claims of the Jaiswals that Chandan and Mandan were away attending different parties when the gang rape took place Kaushik said â€œWe have proof that six youth were in the rooms where the girl was rapedâ€�.

""Their attempts to obliterate evidence has not helped them much as the mattress and clothes of the victim and the accused have revealed much to the FSL team which is working on this case. While we are making good progress in the case all attempts are being made to retrieve the evidence that was stolen by the accusedâ€™s family members,"" said Kaushik.

The police commissioner said that the role of more police officers was under scrutiny. So far six policemen have been suspended for negligence or callousness.
