11,NGO protests GB Road raid,"new delhi: terming the recent raids in g b road to flush out under-age prostitutes as a knee-jerk reaction, a non-governmental organisation has demanded viable rehabilitation programme for sex workers. ``since june 14, 81 girls have been picked up by the police on the suspicion of being minors. most of them have been sent to women's homes from where they will return to the profession in no time,'' ravi kant, executive director of shakti vahini, said at a press conference on wednesday. ``why is the police congratulating itself after raiding brothels when there is no plan of action in place to rehabilitate the girls? the entire procedure only serves to harass the girls further.'' kant said the raids were only spotlight-grabbing ploys by the police while the core issue remained unsolved. ``every year, 60,000 nepali girls are brought into india for prostitution. the entire flesh trade in mumbai thrives on nepali girls. what is the government doing to stop trafficking?'' kant said. ``traffickers are rarely brought to book. it's always the sex workers who are held.'' in this connection, he demanded amendments in the prevention of immoral trafficking act as it amounts to double harassment - first in the hands of the trafficker and then at the hands of the police. kant also condemned the manhandling of sex workers by the police. ``they were dragged away like animals and the policemen did not care how they touched the women,'' he said, adding that policewomen should be deployed during raids at brothels. admitting that even after eight years of association with the sex- workers of g b road his ngo did not have any rehabilitation plan, kant said: ``the initiative has to come from the government. donating sewing machines to these girls is not the answer.'' the ngo demanded a national plan of action against trafficking, formulation of viable rehabilitation programmes, a probe into police highhandedness during the raids and an inquiry into the whereabouts of the rescued girls, who were sent to nari niketans in the last 10 years and later released.

13,"For GeneratioNext, politics is still a dirty career","ahmedabad/vadodara: believe it or not, but even the extravagant bonanza of three-fold hike in emoluments of mps is not inspiring enough for the generationext to pursue the smeared profession of politics as a career! ""it is peanuts as compared to what i will be able to earn once i start practising as a general surgeon. then why pursue a denigrated profession like politics?"" questions jaydev gadhvi, a ms (general surgery) student of km school of post-graduate medical sciences. official salary of rs 12,000 per month, rs 10,000 constituency allowance, rs 14,000 office expense allowance, transport allowance of rs 8 per km, 25 per cent hike in the daily allowance of rs 400, mobile phones and free electricity and water upto 50,000 units and 4,000 kilo-litres respectively... the recent hike in emoluments of mps is manna from heaven, one would say. but not so for the generation next's wannabe professionals who confess they would consider taking up politics only as the last option...when all other options dry up ! ""the hike would be good news for those already in politics... more income is always welcome. but not for me... i am sure i will be able to earn much more after i start my own construction business after completing my engineering. if i fail in that and in all other fields that i may chose, i might consider politics,"" concedes maulin shah, general secretary of ld college of engineering. shah is pursuing de (civil) and plans to go abroad for further studies and start his own construction house later. curiously here, it is not that the salary and other perks are less. it is only that the same is not ""compensation enough"" to enter the big, bad and defamed world of politics. ""politics is basically a thankless job. hard work you may, but all you will get in return is public abuse. no matter how upright or honest you are, you will be viewed as one corrupt baddie, siphoning off the public's hard-earned money"", says akhil bhartiya vidyarthi parishad's state organising secretary govind vagadia , who plans to start his own business. interestingly here, vagadia confesses to feel so from his own experience. ""i have worked as a student leader and have personally witnessed that no student has ever praised the good things that we have been instrumental in bringing out, say, the insurance policy. but all are ever-ready to deride politicians and ever student leaders as corrupt who get admissions at a price and so on and so forth. so its not really worth it"", feels vagadia. shah could not agree more. ""for becoming an mp, one has to minimum invest rs 1 crore. i am the general secretary of my college, i know that entry into any level of politics comes at a specific price-tag. so for a person who has invested rs 1 crore, the hiked salary would mean nothing. he would gain only through corruption and that is something which i am not ready to taint my hands with. small-time student politics is ok, there is nothing exciting about big-time politics"", shah says. bharat dangar ms university students union (msusu) general secretary says, that there are several issues to the rise in mp's emolument. ""on the one hand, it would be wrong to say that those who enter politics do so for the income that it provides, as most politicians have their own business. but on the positive side, it is possible that the salary rise would benefit those who want to work honestly for the society."" prakash verma former msusu vice-president believes that the salary rise per se would not prompt those not interested in politics to enter it. ""most of the politicians enter the field either due to their own social objective or activism or to carry on a family tradition. many politicians are corrupt and the salary increase may not make the field lucrative,"" he said.

""the hindujas are the only bidders as of now. the airlines is a national property and unless we get a proper bidder we cannot disinvest air-india just like that,"" gupta told reporters on the sidelines of a conclave of eastern states on tourism. although the tata-singapore airlines were also officially in the fray to acquire 40 per cent stake in the international carrier, gupta said he had read in newspaper reports that the consortium was not keen on continuing with their bid. asserting that the ministry was expecting competitive bidders to come up with proposals he said since the disinvestment of the airlines was a 'national responsibility', the centre could not afford to let it be 'underpriced' either.

""we want that other airlines should come to do business here, but not at the cost of our domestic airlines,"" he said.

17,Trinamul MLAs rue lack of policy initiative,"kolkata: the trinamul congress has to look beyond mere agitational politics and crying hoarse over the deteriorating law and order situation, feels a section of trinamul mlas. otherwise, it will be difficult for the party to move forward, they point out. reports of a section of disgruntled trinamul joining back the congress are doing the rounds. but sources close to mamata banerjee rule out such a possibility as long as the pradesh congress is controlled by the somen mitra group. a number of newly-elected mlas feel that if trinamul''s current preoccupation with agitational politics continues, they will increasingly find themselves misfit in the organisation. ""people try to find political movements in mamata banerjee. that is why people flock to her,"" points out an mla. these mlas feel that it is time the party took a policy initiative to move forward. perhaps taking the cue, a number of party cells have been set up. while sougata roy has been entrusted with the working of the panchayats, partha chatterjee has taken over as chairman of trinamul economic cell. chatterjee is trying to rope in intellectuals, businessmen and prominent citizens to contribute in shaping trinamul''s policy document. ""my eventual plan is to hold a panchmarhi-type convention where policies could be discussed threadbare,"" chatterjee said. meanwhile, trinamul policy making committee chairman pankaj banerjee reiterated his party''s charge against the state government. ""the new government is approaching its 100 days. but during this time, 18 factories have shut down, not a single one reopened, managers have been killed by workers and a leading industrialist has been kidnapped,"" banerjee pointed out. the trinamul leader also unveiled his party''s agitational programme spanning the next two weeks.

18,NE chief ministers to meet on September 3,"kolkata: chief ministers of the north-eastern states will meet on september 3 in delhi where the on-going problems relating to the decision of the centre to revoke the extension of the ceasefire with the national socialist council of nagalad(isak-muivah) outside nagaland will be thrashed out, assam chief minister tarun gogoi said in kolkata on thursday. addressing a press conference, he said that the delhi meeting would be under the aegis of the north eastern council, but topics other than the economic ones covered under the agenda of the nec would also be taken up for discussion. among them, one important subject was the frequent economic blockades of manipur resorted to by different groups in nagaland after the centre had decided to revoke the earlier decision on ceasefire extension. frequent traffic disruptions on the national highway from kohima to imphal had led to a shortage of essentials in manipur. in turn, student groups in manipur had got in touch with their counterparts in assam for a counter-economic blockade of nagaland. gogoi said the topmost priority of his government was economic development of assam. ""unlike the previous prafulla mahata government, law and order is not our topmost priority. we think insurgency is a consequence of lack of economic development."" he did not think there was a ""military solution"" to the insurgency problem, rather insurgency must be solved through ""dialogue"". one of the main problems was how to stop fresh recruitments to the ranks of the undergrounds. ""on the one hand they are surrendering. on the other, fresh recruitments are going on. this will not solve the problem,"" gogoi pointed out. new recruitments were the highest in nalbari and kokrajhar districts in lower assam. ""economic development alone can stop the youths from joining the ranks of the undergrounds."" gogoi denied, however, that his government contemplated any slackening on the law and order front. ""the unified command is in place and continue to be there. only, the emphasis will shift to development."" he claimed that extortions by ultras had gone down, except in the barak valley. gogoi indicated that his government had not yet been able to get out of the financial mess which it had bequeathed from the mahanta government. asked if his government had been able to clear arrear dues of government employees and school teachers, he said: ""we still have a deficit of rs 150 crore a month, which amounts to a deficit of rs 1,800 crore a year."" gogoi said his government was of the opinion that there was no need to have a sanction of the governor for the prosecution of former chief minister prafulla mahanta in the multicrore letter of credit scandal as mahanta was not a chief minister when the scam took place. in any case, the entire issue was now before the supreme court. denying that his government was out to embarrass mahanta on the question of his relationship with government employee sanghamitra bharali, he said: ""what have we done to make political capital out of it? we should not have spared him. but, we have not done that."" gogoi said his government had asked the union petroleum ministry to make its stand clear on the question of the reliance gas cracker project at tengakhat. the ministry had said it would do so by august 31. for, difficulties had surfaced on the question of supply of gas for the project by the ongc. the public sector giant was now saying that there was not enough gas.

""our experience is that the number of flights in the region has gone down. earlier, there were almost daily flights to jorhat and lahimpur. it is not enough that we have an international airport at guwahati. we must also have the flights."" to this, chamal lal, sitting on the dais, said : ""this is because sometimes enough number of aircraft are not available."" gogoi retorted: ""whatever be the reason, the number of flights has reduced."" gogoi said tourism was one of the priority areas of his government, it was building a few tourism centres instead of thinning out resources over a large area. the number of tourist arrivals in assam had increased to one million in 2000 compared to 328,000 in 1996. the arrival of foreign tourists increased from 3,843 in 1998 to 5,218 in 1999. chaman lal said to widen air coverage in remote areas of the north-east, the civil aviation ministry proposed to deploy two of the six aircraft being acquired by alliance air on a dry lease. guwahati and kolkata would be developned as hub stations and main base for the operation of these turboprop aircraft. the airports authority of india had taken up major projects for the development of the airports at agartala, dibrugarh, dimapur, imphal, lilabari and jorhat, with a total expenditure of rs 131.18 crore. assocham finds the following the weakenessses in the tourism sector in the eastern region and suggests the following: * infrastructure in the eastern region is in a bad shape. the roads connecting the main cities including kolkata with major tourist centres are not properly maintained. air travel facilities are grossly inadequateto meet the needs of tourists. * in the entire region there is only one international airport in kolkata. there is need for at least four international airports in eastern india, one each in orissa, assam, biahr and north bengal. railway services for tourists should be improved and movement of trains should be regularized and speeded up. inland waer transportation should be developed and the facilities modernized to attract tourists. * more hotels need to be developed in different tourist centres and for this the state governments should give full support to prospective investors. special attention should be given to accommodation of foreign tourists. * for providing security to tourists, a special protection force should be raised in eastern india. the force should be trained in protecting tourists arriving from distant places. * beautification of different points of tourist arrival is imperative. entry points should be reorganized to create a visual impact on the tourists. * liberal tax incentives should be provided by the state governments to hotels and other hospitality business. * there is an imperative need for marketing the eastern region to tourists in india and abroad. such marketing requires tourism themes and projecting the themes. there is little clarity on what is to be marketed. *co-ordinated action for tourism development in the region is ncessary. for this, a high-powered body comprising representatives of all the state governments of the eastern region and the tourism industry should be set up. * there is need to draw a comprehensive tourism map indicating all possible tourism potentials. unutilized potentials should be studied. * there is are large marketable tourism products like himalayas, chotanagpur hills, the ganges the brahmaputra and the brahmini and a large number of pilgrimage centres for hindus and buddhists.

20,Bhutan Crown Prince arrives on goodwill visit,"new delhi: crown prince dasho jigme khesar namgyel wangchuck of bhutan is in india on an 11-day familiarisation tour of this country. as the future monarch, it is imperative for the prince to get to know india, bhutan's closest neighbour, feels the bhutanese leadership. this is the crown prince's first official visit abroad. the 21-year-old prince is studying economics and business management in magdalen college, oxford. he did his junior school in bhutan and went to the us for high school. his father, the present king, did his schooling in india. his grandfather and father have both had excellent ties with the indian establishment. in fact, while india is important for bhutan, the himalayan kingdom is equally important to india's strategic requirements. bhutan is the only neighbour with which india has never had any problems and this is mainly because successive governments in new delhi have made sure that differences are quickly ironed out. bhutan is one country which india can totally rely on to side with it on important issues. both countries realise the importance of this relationship and have taken care to nurture it. the handsome, soft spoken, well mannered prince met a cross-section of the capital's elite during a reception on wednesday. he said he was familiar with india and had visited here several times. about his meetings with the president and jaswant singh, the prince said ``the meetings were wonderful.'' an indian official said the president talked at length with the young man and asked him mainly about his interests and his studies. the crown prince, who arrived on monday, has been given a red carpet welcome. he was received by foreign secretary chokila iyer. besides, the meeting with president narayanan and jaswant singh, minister of state for external affairs, omar abdullah, has also hosted a dinner in his honour. the prince took a helicopter ride to the forest research institute in dehradun and the indian military academy. he will also visit mumbai and take a tour of the bhaba atomic research centre as well as the western naval command. in bangalore he is expected to visit isro and hindustan aeronauticals as well as the soft ware technologyical park. the prince will also visit calcutta.

21,AMC's cattle drive may be next victim of pork-barrel politics,"ahmedabad: guess what could be a hot election topic for the sabarmati hustings. cows! impounded ones, that is. the reason: on wednesday two cows at the mirzapur cattle pound of the ahmedabad municipal corporation died. a hindrance on the city thoroughfares, that are over-crowded with stray cattle, the amc had started rounding up cattle this week. but, after the deaths, the samajwadi party has vowed to take up the cattle owners' plights. with cattle-owners and politicians crying foul over violation of cow rights, amc's drive could well be short-lived. ""not more than a fortnight,"" predicted corporation sources. but, this could well be just the beginning as many a political party would find the cow issue close to their hearts, more so as it literally translates into around 5,000 votes in the sabarmati ward -- there are at least 5,000 cattle owners in sabarmati who stand to be appeased by anyone who takes up their cause. the sabarmati by-elections are due on september 20. the corporation's move to register police complaints against stray cattle owners could find many political opponents, especially with the sabarmati polls round the corner. amc began an anti-stray cow move on monday to clear city streets of these obstructions. ""especially during monsoon, the cattle owners let their cows to stray as it would mean less dirt and pollution in their localities. this can only be stopped by something as strict as our drive,"" said an official of amc. dissuasion of negligent cattle owners include shuttling between elusive corporation officials and police personnel to get their cattle released which could take no less than a couple of days. ""till last week there was fine of rs 250 for each stray cow and rs 50 every day of its stay in any of the 12 cattle-pounds owned by the corporation. but, this was not working out as even after paying nothing less than rs 1.35 crore during past five years as penalty for letting cattle go stray there was no improvement visible on roads of ahmedabad,"" said capt dilip mahajan, officer in-charge of cattle nuisance control department. in consideration of the cattle menace and egged on by its health committee the amc revived its 1995 plan -- to file police complaints against cattle owners who allowed their cows to go astray. on monday 76, on tuesday 109 and on wednesday 82 strays cattle were rounded up and a total of 52 police complaints lodged against ""rogue"" cattle owners. but, now with the death of cattle heads and samajwadi party threatening to hold a protest rally in memnagar on august 25 and planning to storm the corporation premises on thursday, the amc drive may soon come to a naught. and this will not be the first time. in 1995, a similar move of amc was thwarted by ""popular demand"" and pressure from gandhinagar. ever since, several measures have been taken, like the one of 1997 to charge negligent cattle-owners rs 1,500 as penalty. the move, that was initiated by the gujarat government, later saw the state ministers pressured into paying rs 1,350 of the penalty-amount as a ""diwali gift"" to cattle owners who got away by paying rs 150. with the 2001 cattle drive of the amc turning political, it could once again turn out to be a case of much ado about nothing.

23,NHRC report confirms govt delay in quake rehab,"gandhinagar: contrary to the state government's claim that the national human rights commission (nhrc) had ""appreciated"" the work done by the state officialdom in earthquake relief, a report finalised by the nhrc speaks of ""the delay in announcement of rehabilitation package, and the slow progress of rehabilitation"". the nhrc report, which the state officialdom has been treating a secret while refusing to part with its text for two months now, recognises that ""the task of rehabilitation is stupendous and will be long drawn"". it emphasises that rehabilitation should be undertaken ""promptly and without aggravating the hardships"" of the victims. noting that power rested in the hands of those around chief minister keshubhai patel, nhrc said this was a reason for the delay. it further says, ""it is necessary that the administration, at the state level, is sensitive to the needs of the quake-affected. for promptly dealing with the grievances, it's necessary to decentralise powers and empower officers at the district-level."" it says, ""rehabilitation process will be aided if the decision-making process is simplified and more powers are granted to officers stationed at bhuj. the commission requests the state government to sufficiently empower the officer stationed at bhuj so that the problems of the affected people can be sorted out at the district level itself. such a course will improve credibility of performance."" the nhrc has asked the state government to concentrate on completing the ""enumeration of orphaned children, destitute women and elderly, and draw up a plan of action for providing relief and rehabilitation to people of each of these categories"". the government should take special care of the marginalised sections of society, namely the sc/st. the government should endeavour to ensure that relief for the affected members of this section is adequate and that there is no exploitation. pinpointing an instance of discrimination, the nhrc says, ""the commission is concerned that the dalits who have migrated to areas nearer to bhuj from areas north of the district are being asked to go back. the reason for their migration is that they find better economic opportunities near the district headquarters. the return of the dalits to their villages should be entirely voluntary."" an nhrc source said the recommendation has been ""accepted"" and the forced eviction stopped. taking a serious view of the fact that ""recently constructed multi-storey buildings collapsed in different parts of the state, especially ahmedabad, which is 400 km from the epicentre"", the nhrc asked the state government to ""look at building by-laws, update them, and, most importantly, ensure proper implementation of the building by-laws"". a four-person group headed by pgj nampoothiri, special representative, is already on the job of identifying, community-wise, whether the packages announced by the state government are being equally distributed. next month, it expects to start public hearings in different parts of the state's quake-affected areas. within two months of its formation, the monitoring group has received thousands of complaints from jamnagar and surendranagar districts about lack of proper assessment of quake damage, and poor disbursement. the group has also identified 160-odd paraplegia patients, mainly in kutch, who will be bed-ridden for the rest of their lives. ""we think paraplegia patients should not be given the same amount of rs 50,000 as other permanently disabled ones,"" sethi said. ""there should be a permanent source of monthly allowance for them.""
