0,SAD puts off Sept 5 protest plan,"ALAMGIR (Ludhiana): SAD has put off its proposed plan of dharna and offer of arrest by its MLAs and prominent leaders on September 5 at Chandigarh in protest against non-performance, excesses and corruption by the Congress led state government.

SAD president Parkash Singh disclosed this after the meeting of the partyâ€™s political affairs committee (PAC) held at Gurdwara Manji Sahib here on Monday. The programme was put off due to assembly session on September 22. A fresh date would be announced soon after this , he informed.

Badal added that a joint protest rally would be organised on September 2 by SAD and BJP at the venue of controversial bridge inauguration near Mukerian on August 20.

The central BJP leaders will attend the rally. Accusing Amarinder of unleashing confrontationist politics, Badal termed the unprovoked violence resorted to by the police on the orders of the state government as â€˜murder of democracyâ€™. He defended opening of the bridge by union minister Vinod Khanna saying that it was completed due to his efforts.

The meeting passed resolutions including demand of apology from the Sikh community by state finance minister Lal Singh and chief minister Amarinder Singh in whose presence the former had equated the Nehru-Gandhi family with Guru Gobind Singh in terms of making sacrifices.

Terming Amarinder as the head of the ""worst government"" in the state, Badal alleged the law and order situation in the state ebbed so low due to blatant politicalisation of the state police.

Taking a dig at Amarinder, Badal said addressing him as captain was a misnomer since he showed lack of concern for the soldiers by imposing sales tax on CSD items. Instead of granting them concession, he withdrew what was available to them in recognition of their services for the the country, Badal remarked.

The meeting constituted a three member committee comprising SGPC secretary Manjit Singh Calcutta, MLA Jagir Kaur and former minister Sucha Singh Langah to select candidates and supervise gurdwara election in J&K.

1,"Residents, SAD block traffic against arrest of 26 persons","MANSA: Hundreds of workers of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and residents of Gehlewala village of Mansa staged a dharna and blocked vehicular traffic near Ramditta crossing at Mansa for over three hours on Monday in protest against the arrest of 26 residents of the village ""for violence on the panchayat election day"" here on June 30.

The Mansa police have registered a case against about one dozen persons, including Bhoga Singh, the SAD supported-candidate in panchayat election and some unidentified persons allegedly for setting a truck of polling party on fire on the intervening night of June 29-June 30.

Some police men and polling party members had then received serious burn injuries.

Later on, the police had allegedly rounded up a number of youths in the village in the case to build pressure on the real culprits to surrender before the police.

The villagers alleged that though the culprits named in the FIR had surrendered but the police were not releasing the innocent persons. Jagpreet Singh, president youth Akali Dal in Mansa who was leading the dharna, alleged that all persons arrested by the police were SAD workers and most of them had no direct or indirect connection with the incident.

He alleged that for the last about 50 days, 26 residents of the village were languishing in the jail and there was no one to take care of their families.

The incident of setting the polling party truck on fire relates to the dispute between the Akali and Congress party workers at Gehlewala village on the panchayat election day during the counting of votes. On June 30, the truck had reached Gehle village after collecting ballot boxes and polling party members from three other villages of the area.

After announcing the result of Gehle village panchayat in favour of Darshan Singh, a Congress-supported candidate, when the polling party members were placing the ballot boxes in the truck, all of sudden a mob of about 20 persons attacked the truck and set it on fire, sprinkling some inflammable liquid.

At that time, six persons, including Joginder Pal Singh, an SHO, a constable and members of the polling party, had received severe burn injuries and polling material was destroyed in the fire.

Lakhwinder Singh, SP (D) Mansa, denied the allegations of framing any person in a false case. He said that after receiving a complaint by some of the accused, a DSP was deputed to inquire about their involvement in the incident.

3,Fake dealers supply drugs to govt hospitals,"BANGALORE: Wheeler-dealers use fake letterheads and forge names of big drug companies, and supply drugs to government hospitals and public health centres. No one knows if the drugs are spurious. The authorities fail to smell a rat. Until last month, when the government stumbled upon the scam.

The lid was blown clean off when the health department sought some clarifications from the companies regarding some drugs. According to documents available with ''The Times of India'', fake drug suppliers produced forged letterheads of big companies (Government of India enterprises), including Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Companies Ltd, Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd and Bengal Immunity Ltd, and supplied drugs worth lakhs of rupees to various district health centres, PHCs and government hospitals in Karnataka.

Their modus operandi was to appoint agents who posed as distributors of major drug companies or directly write letters on fake letterheads. The district health authorities, too, did not bother to check the credentials of these companies before sanctioning orders worth lakhs of rupees. In some cases, drugs ""purchased'''' never reached the hospitals. ""We were shocked when these companies wrote back saying they never manufactured such drugs nor did they deal with stockists mentioned by the government. We may have to assume that drugs sold by these dealers were spurious,'''' sources said. For instance, one P.K. Pharma supplied tab Ibuprofen in the name of Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd (HAL).

But HAL has written to say it does not manufacture the drug, nor is P.K. Pharma an authorised stockist of HAL drugs. Similarly, Quality Pharma supplied Gentamycin eye and ear drops for Bengal Immunity Ltd, another central government undertaking. But the company replied it had not supplied any drugs to Karnataka. When the health department wrote to the district officers on the status of drugs purchased, officers at Bangalore Rural, Nelamangala, Hoskote, Channapatna, Madhugiri, Kanakapura and Magadi said they had not received them. Health and family welfare minister Kagodu Thimmappa said he has asked the Lok Ayukta to investigate the drug purchase scam and submit a report to the government.

Hukum Singh Sekhawat, a resident of Bhanderi-ni-pole, told Justice GT Nanavati and Justice KG Shah ""Muslims of the adjoining area of Popatiawad, Sultan Muhallah and Baluchiawad had attacked our locality with automatic weapons, like AK-47 and hurled bombs and acid at the Hindu houses.""

6,College admn charges govt with apathy,"KISHANGANJ: The state governmentâ€™s attitude towards the private-run Mata Gujri Memorial (MGM) Medical College and Hospital, recognised by the Medical Council of India (MCI) and affiliated by Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University (BNMU), Madhepura, has been discriminatory, says Dilip Kumar Jaiswal, chief administrator of the college.

The medical college and hospital was founded in 1991 and was formally inaugurated by the late President Giani Zail Singh. On the intervention of the Supreme Court, the MCI granted permanent and regular recognition and the B N Mandal University accorded affiliation to the college.

Six batches have already passed out from this college. The state government is discriminatory towards the institution as the students who have already done MBBS are â€œbarredâ€� from doing their post-graduate (PG) here. However, they are allowed to do PG in other states, says Jaiswal.

Spread over about 35 acres of land in the periphery of this district town, the MGM Medical College, since its inception, has acquired assets worth over Rs 25 crore. It can boast of imposing buildings, well-furnished classrooms and auditorium and basic infrastructure needed for a medical college and hospital, according to secretary Jugal Prasad Toshniwal. The college plans to invest Rs two crore in a separate building on the campus where latest medical gadgets and facilities will be provided, says Jaiswal. He claimed that the college has on an average done 70 to 75 per cent results in MBBS final year. Quite a few of its alumni are engaged in reputed hospitals in Delhi, Chandigarh and Lucknow.

7,Sporadic incidents mar bandh,"DANAPUR: Barring sporadic incidents of disruption, train movement in the Danapur division of the East Central Railway (ECR) remained by and large normal in the division.

No major incident and damage to railway property were so far reported from any part of the division. Banned Naxalite outfits MCC and PWG had called a Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal bandh on Monday.

According to senior divisional operating manager (senior DOM) of Danapur Praveen Pandey, the bandh supporters had threatened and chased the gateman at Banahi station on the Mughalsarai-Danapur section of the division early in the morning. As a result, train movement was disrupted for the time being near Banahi. However, normalcy was restored soon when the armed RPF personnel rushed to the spot, he said and added that MCC people raided the Rathi station on the Patna-Gaya (PG) section in the wee hours and forced the station master to leave the station. Train movements were, however, disrupted for about one hour on the PG section, Pandey said.

Senior DOM informed that the Patna-Howrah Shatabdi Express, which had left Patna Junction in time on Monday, was detained for few hours near Burdwan as thick smoke was billowed out from coachs C4 and C5 of the train. He ruled out any mischief on the Shatabdi Express by the miscreants, but he maintained that the alertness of the cabinman at Gurpa between Burdwan and Howrah averted any major mishap. No passenger was hurt in the incident and the train reached Howrah safely after disconnecting the affected coaches, he said.

According to senior DOM, though the bandh call was given in three states - West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar - railways did not cancel any train arriving at Patna Junction in particular from West Bengal. Moreover, most of the trains which were Patna-bound would leave Howrah late evening, he said and added that late arrival of trains was possible in Bihar due to the complete bandh in Jharkhand and West Bengal.

The Dhanbad division of the ECR was the worst affected due to the bandh call in Jharkhand. Since midnight, train movement had come to a grinding halt in the division. The bandh supporters resorted to violence at several places in the division and burnt the electric locomotive of a goods train near Mangra between Garwha and Barbadih station. Train movement was restored on this section after 10 hours of disruption, sources said.

Incidents of removal of fish plates were reported in large number in the Dhanabd division particularly in Daltonganj areas. About 20 pairs of long distance trains were detained for few hours at different station in the division. At Gaya station, several important trains like Rajdhani Express, Bombay Mail and Ganga-Damodar remained stranded for about five to seven hours.

According to sources, the banned Naxal outfits, which had targeted the railways badly, were said to have exchanged fire with the police on the Larwha section of the Dhanbad division, leading to total disruption of train movement for about 12 hours.

Meanwhile, the Danapur RPF commandant Ramashankar Prasad Singh said that security in the railways has been tightened in the division due to the dawn-to-dusk bandh call given by the Naxal outfits.

8,Paswan flays NDA govt,"BIHARSHARIF: The national president of Lok Janshakti Party, Ram Vilas Paswan, on Sunday inaugurated the three-day training camp for party workers at Rajgir.

In his speech , Paswan emphasised the importance of training to the party workers.

""Without proper training the workers may not be aware of the ideals and programmes of the party and so they can not take the party''s campaign to the common people.""

Unless the common people understand the party ideology and its commitment towards them, they can not vote the party to power, Paswan added.

Paswan urged the party workers to go to every block and panchayat of the state and enlighten the people with the policies and programmes of party.

Paswan criticised the NDA government at the Centre for its failure on many fronts. He urged the people to remove the NDA government soon. He added that while people of Bihar are suffering from many problems, the Vajpayee government has become a mute spectator to their sufferings. ""The NDA government has been neglecting Bihar for long, but the people here will take revenge when they get an opportunity,"" he said.

He also expressed his displeasure over the handling of controversy over the domicile policy by the Jharkhand government.

Paswan felt an urgent need to provide jobs to unemployed youths as unemployment compels them to take to crime. Others who were present on the occasion included Arif Mohammed Khan, Narendra Singh, Ramchandra Paswan and Pashupati Paras.

9,"SJM, BMS, BKS ask govt to be firm on WTO","NEW DELHI: Ahead of WTO Ministerial in Cancun, Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) on Monday asked the government to remain firm and not give into pressure imposed by developed countries on issues of interest for developing countries such as agriculture, and industrial tariffs and Singapore.

""Government should remain firm on its stand on various issues especially agriculture, industrial tariffs and Singapore and not succumb to pressure from the developed world,"" Mahendra Pandey, regional convenor, SJM told reporters here.

He said India should look at forming alliances with like-minded countries having similar interests and push for its stand on these issues and if the developed world does not yield -- it should withdraw from membership of WTO.

Asking the government to go public about its strategy and stand on various issues, Amarnath Dogra of BMS said India should maintain its firmness on the lines of Doha and not let WTO dictate the country''s economic reforms.

SJM, BMS and BKS are organising a major sit-in (Mahadharna) on September 02, 2003 as last of the series of their countrywide protest marches (sangharsh yatras) and have mobilised nearly 20,000 workers, farmers and intellectuals, Dogra said.

10,Dr Reddy's plans to increase R&D spend,"HYDERABAD: Dr Reddy''s Laboratories, one of the leading pharmaceutical companies, is planning to increase its research and development (R&D) spend in order to strengthen its product pipeline.

During 2002-03, the company invested Rs 137.5 crore on R&D, about 8 per cent of its total revenue. However, during the current year, the company would increase its investment in drug discovery and other R&D to about 10 per cent of its total revenues, the company''s chairman Dr K Anji Reddy said.

""For a company that is just 10 years into its drug discovery efforts, today, we have an exciting and enviable new chemical entity (NCE) pipeline. We have three molecules in clinical development and five in the preclinical development in the areas of metabolic disorders, cardiovascular cancer, inflammation and infection,"" Reddy said while speaking at the company''s 19th annual general meeting.

The company has made its intentions clear in terms of its product approach and has identified the US market to be the key for future growth. The company''s target based discovery and validation programme at Atlanta is progressing and has two molecules in preclinical development and one in discovery state. ""One of the preclinical candidates, RUS 3108 is a new approach to treat atherosclerosis, he said.

However, Dr Reddy''s has been working on rolling out its own molecule. ""The bigger challenge is to take a molecule from our pipeline all the way to the market place cost-effectively and also make it available at affordable price to the people. I am confident that we will bring our own molecule to the market in this decade â€“ the first decade of 21st century,"" Reddy said.

On the US market front, the company is sharpening its focus to take advantage of the opportunities that are likely to come up in the market in the next four to five years. ""We are increasing product development for these markets. For our US generics business, we have a target of filing 15 to 18 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs),"" Dr Reddy''s chief executive officer G V Prasad said.

However, the company is planning to kick start its specialty strategy with the launch of amlodipine maleate subject to approval by the US federal circuit court.

11,Mulayam stakes claim to form govt,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday staked his claim to form a government in Uttar Pradesh.

Yadav met the Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri at 11 am and handed him a four point letter highlighting the current political scenario in the state and quoted the earlier precedents of the single largest opposition party being called to form a government when the current one had been reduced to a minority.

The SP president who was accompanied by the leader of the Oppositions in the Vidhan Sabha Azam Khan, Vidhan Parishad Ahmad Hasan, state president Ram Sharan Das and general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav, later told the press that he had met the governor and handed him a letter apprising him of the current political siutation in the state. He refused to disclose what transpired between him and Shastri but said the governor had assured him that an appropriate decision would be taken by him.

Yadav said he had staked claim in February 2002 and had the requisite numbers to prove his majority. He said the SP did not believe in the politics of horse trading and was hopeful that all other like-minded parties would extend their support to him in the formation of the government.

A visibly elated Yadav who had throughout maintained that the BSP-BJP coalition government would collapse under the weight of its own inherent contradictions said happiness was palpable in all sections of society over the fall of this government. He hoped the government would keep this sentiment of the people in mind at the time of taking any decision and hoped that the decision would come through soon.

Asked if he had held inividual talks with leaders of other political parties Yadav replied in the affirmative and said if need be, they would sit together collectively. He reiterated his belief in the unity of all opposition parties.

In response to Chief Minister Mayawati''s observation that she was willing to forgive the SP if it apologised publicly for the June 2 1995 state guest house incident, Yadav said the word apology did not exist in the dictionary of the party. He added that Mayawati''s observation only showed that the cases against the SP workers were fabricated and also the charges levelled against them.

The SP president who handed copies of the letter given to the governor said he had drawn the attention of Shastri that since the SP was the single largest opposition party it should be called to form a government.

Highlighting other points, Yadav said the letter stated that since the 87 member BJP had withdrawn support the Mayawati government had been reduced to a minority. In such an eventuality any talks of seeking a vote of confidence was ridiculous.

Recalling the time when the Morarji Desai government fell, the letter states that the then president had called the Congress, which was the single largest party to form a government. Similarly when the VP Singh government fell it was late Rajiv Gandhi who was called to form a government. A little ahead in time Shankar Dayal Sharma had administered the oath of office to Atal Behari Vajpayee.

The letter further mentions that whenever there is a division in the government it is then that the question of minority/majority arises and it is under this condition that the CM is asked to prove majority. The last point of the letter draws the attention of the governor to the fact that in a democracy conventions were as sacrosant as the articles of the Constitution.

12,Fernandes rules out visit to Pak,"BANGALORE: Defence Minister George Fernandes has ruled out a visit by him to Pakistan, unless the neighbour stopped its proxy war against India.

""We are in a state of conflict. There is a proxy war on (against India)... And with that kind of situation, there is no way a Defence Minister can go to Pakistan, not till there is an end to proxy war or cross-border terrorism,"" said Fernandes.

Insisting that terrorism should be stopped, he said, ""If this is not going to stop, then that is going to create far more problems, not just to the sub continent, but to the whole world"".

Fernandes said though infiltration had reduced ""there are ups and downs, you have people coming in"".

Observing that people of both India and Pakistan wanted peace and tranquility between the neighbours, he said, there was a feeling in the two countries that ""we need to find a way out of this predicament, which I belive we have found out"".

He said President Pervez Musharraf''s recent statement that only talks could resolve the dispute between the neighbours showed that dialogue would be a better way.

14,President's rule likely in UP,"LUCKNOW: The parting of ways between coalition partners, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party, and subsequent recommendation by chief minister Mayawati to dissolve the vidhan sabha may ultimately push the state towards President''s rule.

Governor Vishnukant Shastri said he would seek a legal opinion on the recommendation made by the incumbent chief minister before taking any action on it.

Raj Bhawan sources told TNN on Monday that the Centre had been posted with ground reality about Uttar Pradesh. If the state is placed under President''s rule, this will be the second spell of Central rule under Vishnukant Shastri.

After enjoying political stability for quite long the state came under President''s rule for the first time in 1968 when the Sanyukta Vidhayak Dal government headed by Charan Singh collapsed. The second spell of Central rule in the state also came when the coalition government headed by Singh was brought down by the Congress.

The third time the state came under President''s rule was in 1975 after the fall of the Bahuguna government. In 1977 and 1980 the state came under President''s rule when the UP government was dismissed by the Janata Party and the Congress governments, respectively.

When in 1992 the Kalyan Singh government was dismissed by the Narasimha Rao government, the state came under the spell of Central rule. In 1995 when Mayawati resigned the state was under Central rule and again Uttar Pradesh came under President''s rule when no party could win comfortable majority in the 2002 polls.

The minister -- who is also known for his astrological skills -- even went to the extent of fixing the ""muhurtam"" (auspicious time) for the swearing in ceremony. According to him the new government would swear in on September 27, 2004 at 11.15 am.

The minister also predicted that the November 16, 2003, would mark a turning point in the life of their leader N Chandrababu Naidu. The stellar position of Naidu would move into highly favourable situation and ""better time"" would dawn for him.

Meanwhile, an opinion poll conducted within the party predicted that TDP would win 92 per cent of the seats. As Naidu read out the result of the opinion poll, one of the delegates whistled in ecstasy. Naidu -- who paused for a minute -- decided to ignore it. He however told party workers not to get complacent looking at the result of the opinion poll.

Minutes later when Naidu started delivering the valedictory address and said that TDP was the only party which had fulfilled the promises made in its election manifesto and at Mahanadu, there was another whistle. Not happy with this behaviour, Naidu told the delegate to control his enthusiasm. Over enthusiasm is not good for you or the party, he remarked.

20,WTO draft agenda on farm sector disappoints,"NEW DELHI: Even though the revised WTO draft agenda circulated two weeks ahead of the Ministerial in Cancun is seen as a forward movement In negotiations on agriculture, trade experts feel much more needs to be done to address the concerns of developing countries in the farm sector.

""It is certainly a forward movement from the pro-developed EU-US draft on agriculture but fell far short of the counter proposal made by developing countries led by India, China and Brazil,"" trade experts familiar with WTO negotiations said on Tuesday.

There are several pluses and minuses as in any draft, experts said, adding that the proposal on non-agricultural market access appears to be somewhat balanced from developing countries'' point of view.

Commerce Ministry officials said they were still studying the draft and refused to answer any queries.

However, India''s Ambassador to WTO in Geneva, K M Chandrasekhar, voiced disappointment over parts of the latest draft text on agriculture and said ""the distortions will remain substantially with the result that not enough progress may be achieved in that sector which is crucial.""

Brazilian Ambassador to WTO, Luiz Felipe de Seixas Correa favoured the farming proposal put forward by Brazil, India and a group of other developing countries.

""It is a serious proposal that goes in the direction of compromise. It represents 19 countries - over 63 per cent of world''s agricultural population,"" he said.

Speaking at the valedictory of the two day executive meeting, Naidu said their only aim was to put spokes in whatever developmental activities we take up. ""They have cast their eyes only on garnering voters and have no love or concern for people"".

While the Congress leaders from Nalgonda threaten to launch agitation if water was released to farmers under Krishna Delta, leaders of the same party from Krishna served ultimatum that they would resign from the party if water was not released.

Calling them as myopic people, Naidu said if they had love for the people or the state''s interest in mind, they would have forced the state Congress to put pressure on their party high command to tame Karnataka government from constructing illegal dams across various rivers.

There were other parties like the Telangana Rashtra Samiti which does not have any direction. Their leader without understanding the basics of water availability uses foul language which goes against the culture of the region.

Naidu said 170 tm cft of water was available in Nagarjuna Sagar, 67 tm cft in Sriramsagar, 2.3 tm cft in Nizam sagar and 143.6 tm cft at Almatti. There was no water available in the upper reaches of Krishna while some water was available in the Krishna Delta.

In view of the Assembly elections slated next year, all these parties were raising hue and cry and trying to project as if the government had perpetuated injustice on Telangana. All these parties were trying to fan regional feelings and create disharmony in the state. He said as a responsible government, the TD had worked out priorities based on the need of farmers and availability of water and was trying to meet their requirements. He called upon the cadre to effectively counter this propaganda and ""expose"" them.

22,"HC issues notices to election officer, MLCs","BANGALORE: The Karnataka High Court has issued emergent notices to five MLCs and the State Election Officer among other respondents following a petition filed by members of the Bommanahalli City Municipal Council alleging that the MLCs have been illegally included in the list for the forthcoming election for president.

A N Murali and four other councillors of the CMC alleged in their petition that the respondents - Commissioner and Secretary to Department of Municipal Administration, DC, Bangalore Urban District and Returning Officer and State Election Commissioner had attempted to illegally include the five MLCs as voters for election to president of the Bommanahalli CMC on August 28, 2003.

The MLCs are K B Munivenkata Reddy, Dr L Hanumanthaiah, B A Hasanabba, Umashree and Nirmala Venkatesh. The petitioners contended that the MLCs were not residents of the CMC area, but were from Bangalore City Corporation limits and are not eligible to vote.

The MLCs have been included as members of the Municipal council by showing fictitious addresses and will participate in the election with the intention to defeat candidates sponsored by non-Congress candidates, the petitioners further contended.

Justice Chandrashekaraiah issued emergent notices and directed the DC not to declare results of the election until further orders.

Chief Justice N K Jain and Justice Mohan Shantangoudar adjourned hearing of a petition filed by former minister S K Kantha seeking a CBI inquiry in respect of the Hyderabad-Karnataka Education Society, Gulbarga entering into a bartering agreement with a city-based antique aircraft collector to hand over a II World War diesel run antique German aircraft, BF109.

The petitioner contended that the 1962-aircraft, being one of the only two existing diesel aircraft in the world was donated to the society to aid in training of aeronautical engineers. The aircraft was however dumped in a yard of the society and in a meeting on March 27, 2002, the members took a resolution to transfer it to the antique collector.

The aircraft worth crores of rupees has been sold to the collector amid several underhand dealings, the petitioner contended, praying before the court for a CBI probe. Despite complaints lodged with the Station Bazaar police and the SP, no action has been taken so far.

The court meanwhile granted time for the state government to file its objections.

23,Govt to simplify passport issuing rules,"BANGALORE: Applicants for passports will soon find the procedure easier, with the Centre contemplating asking them to get police verification before sending in their applications.

Union minister of state for external affairs, Vinod Khanna, told The Times of India on Tuesday that he was holding discussions with his department officials and the intelligence bureau on the issue. ""Applicants can now go to the police first for verification. Once applicants get the clearance there, issuing of passport is a matter of 35 days,"" he added.

Contending that police verification was the most tedious part of the passport application procedure, Khanna, however, felt it was necessary. ""There is no other way of preventing criminals or illegal entrants from getting a valid document proclaiming them as Indian citizens.""

The simplification procedure was suggested at a meeting on Tuesday by the Bangalore city police, which he was accepting, Khanna added.

A beginning in simplifying the procedure for passports had been made with decentralisation. Applications will be received at the district level and sent to the main office for process.

""As many as 23 states have implemented it. But Karnataka is beginning it only now. It is the Congress ruled states which have delayed starting this programme,"" he maintained.

Khanna, who paid a surprise visit to Bangalore passport office on Tuesday and interacted with the people and the officials there said: ""It has a very spacious office. But certain systems are not in place. Visitors are not given adequate replies to their queries.""

He quoted the example of HUDCO''s former CMD V Suresh, who happened to be at the passport office during his surprise visit. ""The retired official had come for a change of address in his passport. After waiting for two hours in the queue, he reached the counter only to be told that the form he was submitting was not the right one,"" he added.

Khanna said he would ask all offices to issue entire set of forms which are relevant to all aspects related to passport. A fee would be charged for the documents.

The minister, who started his surprise checks of passport offices from Chennai said he planned to standardise the design of all offices in the country. He also launched a Tamil website of Chennai office and wanted other states to follow suit in their respective languages.

State BJP president Ananth Kumar, at the interaction meeting of Khanna with BJP workers, said he was the first external affairs minister in recent times to have visited a passport office.

24,Karnataka CM convenes all-party meet on setting up HC Bench,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S M Krishna on Tuesday said he has convened an all-party meeting to discuss the issue of setting up a high court bench in North Karnataka.

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with chief justice N K Jain in the evening, he, however, said the date for the meeting has not been finalised yet as the BJP floor leaders were not in the capital.

With the chief justice refusing a high court bench in North Karnataka, advocates of the region have launched an agitation intensifying their demand and setting an ultimatum to establish a bench.

""We had a free and frank exchange of views. I explained the state government''s stand and the need for setting up a bench. The chief justice also reiterated his position,"" he said, without divulging the outcome of the meeting.

The chief minister said the outcome of the all-party meeting would be conveyed to the chief justice. ""We will come back to the chief justice after the meeting,"" he said.

When asked about the ultimatum issued by the agitating advocates, Krishna said these issues cannot be solved through ultimatums as the decisions are not taken at the government level but involves the judiciary which is the decision making authority.

""As far as our stand is concerned, we have reiterated the need for a bench. From how many platforms should we reiterate our stand? I appeal to the agitating persons to maintain peace and not lose patience,"" Krishna said and added that efforts were on to create a consensus on the location of the bench.

26,Autos cash in despite govt plans,"KOLKATA: The bustling Sealdah and Howrah stations were unusually quiet on Tuesday with only few private buses on select routes and a battery of state government buses servicing the passengers at the two biggest two major railway terminals in the state.

Though a few taxi drivers had stayed overnight, most passengers were prepared for the worst. â€œHowever, around 10 am, a section of union supporters came up to the taxi stand and forced the few cabs parked outside the old station complex to leave,â€� said a senior Eastern Railway official.

At the airport, the state government had made elaborate arrangements for the passengers, but tourist taxi and auto-rickshaw operators jumped ahead and succeeded in fleecing the passengers.

Touts had a field day, thronging the arrival terminals of both the international and domestic terminals. Ranjit Deb, a passenger, had to fork out Rs 400 to reach his Jadavpur residence.
