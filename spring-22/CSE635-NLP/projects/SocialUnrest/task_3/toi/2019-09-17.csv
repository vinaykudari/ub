0,Chhaya denies scam in agricultural department,"KOLKATA : Three days after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dropped a bombshell, alleging a scam in the state agricultural marketing department, the minister in charge of the department and Forward Bloc leader Chhaya Ghosh claimed that she had committed no illegal act and she had no â€œclashâ€� with the chief minister.

Bhattacharjee had charged in a Left Front committee meeting last Friday that Chhaya Ghoshâ€™s department had been illegally collecting taxes from agricultural commodities and the money so raised was not even being deposited in the treasury.

Ghosh said her department was collecting tax since 1972, according to the Regulated Markets Act. â€œThere is nothing illegal about it. We are acting according to the provisions of law. I have sent a report on the issue to the CM,â€� she said. â€œWe will continue to collect the tax till the Act is amended,â€� she added.

Asked to comment on the allegation that the money raised was not being deposited in the government coffers, an irritated Ghosh said the money was being collected against proper receipts.

â€œWe raise about Rs 30-35 crore every year on this account. Of this, 30 per cent is spent on salaries and 50 per cent on development,â€� Ghosh claimed

1,Environmentally-friendly buildings can increase profits,"KOLKATA: Environmentally-friendly buildings are profitable for employers as the output of employees increase manifold in a healthy working atmosphere, claim United States Green Building Council (USGBC) which has started Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEEDS).

â€œEvery year, an estimated to $ 29 to $ 168 billion national productivity are lost due to unhealthy working environment in the U.S. Green buildings offer an opportunity to create environmentally sound and resource efficient buildings by using an integrated approach to design,â€� said the vice chairman of USGBC, Kath Williams in Kolkata on Monday.

This type of constructions, she felt not only reduced operational costs but also reduced absenteeism and maximised turnover. â€œSimple tools like creating a healthy and comfortable environment go a long way in enhancing performance of the people in a building,â€� she added.

In fact, a operational cost reduces by more than 43 per cent and has even found to be improving retail sales as many as by 40 per cent. But these aspects are still not being looked into, she claimed. â€œResource conservation including energy efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation features, considering environmental impact and minimisation of waste are extremely important aspects as we are exploiting the natural resources injudiciously,â€� claimed Donna McIntire, consultant, USGBC.

There are five aspects to consider before putting up a sustainable site planning, safeguarding water management, energy efficiency, conservation of materials and resources and indoor environmental quality.

2,CPM to revamp Hill unit to counter GNLF’s misrule,"SILIGURI: Moving away from its longstanding policy of keeping the GNLF in good humour, the CPM has decided to revamp its organisational set up in the Hills, focusing on the GNLFâ€™s â€œmisruleâ€�.

This was stated by party leader and state urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharya here on Monday.

The move is being interpreted as an attempt by the party to expand its base in the Hills, as elections to the DGHC, panchayats and municipalities are slated to be held in the next 18 months.

Deviating from a stand he held for years, Bhattacharya admitted an underground separatist current still exists in the Hills. This was radically different from this previous view that after formation of the DGHC in 1988, there is no separatist demand of the Hill people.

Accepting that the ruling party of the plains was still far behind the strength of the GNLF in the Hills, he felt that â€œthe GNLF also witnessed underground erosion in their support base,which has created a political vacuumâ€�.

â€œWith GNLF misrule becoming apparent and improper utilisation of DGHC funds, the people of the Hills have started searching for an alternative.

We do not want to allow the destructive forces to utilise this vacuum,â€� Bhattacharya said. His words clearly indicated towards the CPRM, the breakaway faction of the CPM, which is fast gaining strength in the hills.

Veteran Kurseong CPM leader Tulsi Bhattarai has recently been suspended from the party on charges of corruption, stripping him of all posts in the District Party secretariat. Political observers felt that the move would invariably cause unrest among the party rank and file. There is a rumour that Bhattarai is going to join ranks with rebel CPM leader Saifuddin Chaudhury.

The minister, however, denied that Bhattaraiâ€™s expulsion would affect the partyâ€™s prospects. On the other hand, he expressed his concern over the infiltration of the Maoist activists in the district through the border areas.

The entire trekking route from Manebhanjan to Sandakphu, through the Singalila National park, is being used by the Maoists to infiltrate into India, the minister said. â€œWe know that the Akhil Bharatiya Nepali Ekta Samaj supporters are giving shelter to them.

The police is cautions on the matter,â€� he said. ABNES is an ultra-left organisation and a member of Compossa.

Presently, it is operating under different names after being banned under Pota, police sources said.

â€œWe are trying to keep the Nepali youth away from these anti-national forces thorugh a number of activities,â€� Bhattacharya said.

3,Jharkhand vets caution AH minister,"RANCHI: The Jharkhand animal husbandry department is repeating the mistakes committed by its Bihar counterpart which led to the infamous multi-crore animal husbandry (AH) scam, the Jharkhand Pashu Chikitsa Seva Sangh (JPCSS) has warned AH minister Devidhan Besra and chief minister Babulal Marandi.

The Sangh has told the chief minister that majority of the schemes prepared by the AH department are based on imaginary data or are mere estimations. Besides this, violation of establishment rules in transfer and posting has left the department vulnerable to machinations of vested interests.

Many officials have been retained on the posts which they have been serving for the last 10 to 20 years. The list submitted by the Sangh contains names of 19 such AH officials.

The department has also been showing disregard to the departmental norm of inter-range transfer after every six years. The norm also stipulates that an official transferred from one range can come back to the same range after serving for six years in each of the remaining two ranges. There are three ranges in Jharkhand, namely Santhal Pargana (Dumka), South Chotanagpur (Ranchi) and North Chotanagpur (Hazaribagh).

The Sangh has informed the chief minister that 38 transfers were ordered within the same range but through different notifications. And 64 transfers were made within the same range through one notification.

The chief minister has also been informed that changes in notifications have been made either by hand or by overtyping, but without the mandatory signature of the competent authority at the correction. Such changes indicate that either an officialâ€™s transfer has been cancelled or he has been given additional charge. In some cases, the official has been allowed to continue on the same post.

Significantly, the Sangh has told the chief minister that 12 separate files were created for 12 notifications so that the transfer lists could not be compared. The mistakes mentioned above have led to an interesting development. There are at present only 385 veterinary doctors or AH officials working in Jharkhand, but the transfer notifications indicate 560 to 570 officials have been transferred within a year.

4,Varanasi police gear up for BJP rally on Sep 18,"VARANASI: The district police have made elaborate security arrangements in Beniabagh and adjoining localities for the September 18 rally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). As it is a Muslim dominated area the police and intelligence sleuths are taking extra precaution.

The police have also requested local BJP leaders not to deliver provocative speeches at the rally as it can trigger communal tension. Local people still have not forgotten the violence that had gripped the locality when BJP leaders delivered provocative speeches at a rally held at the Beniabagh park in 1991.

The BJP too avoided holding its rallies at the Beniabagh Park after the 1991 incident. But now once again the party has decided to organise its rally, which will be addressed by senior leaders, including BJP chief Venkaiah Naidu and state president Vinay Katiyar, at the same spot.

Recalling the 1991 incident, Ahmed Rizvi, a local resident, said that some BJP workers had put up their party flags in front of their houses. The trouble started when some local persons too put up flags of the communist party near the Beniabagh park, he said adding that the BJP workers immediately swung into action and started uprooting the flags put up by the local residents.

The flag war took an ugly turn when the people from both the sides started pelting stones at each other, Rizvi said and added the provocative speech of BJP MP Shrishchand Dixit added fuel to fire and soon communal riots broke out in the city. Though by fanning communal passions the BJP succeeded in retaining all the assembly and parliamentary seats here, the local people, especially petty shopkeepers and traders, had to face heavy financial losses, he added.

When contacted, BJP city chief Harshpal Kapoor said that the party had to opt for the Beniabagh park as the ground of Town Hall was booked for some other event. The party had also taken permission of the district administration for holding its rally at the park, he added.

However, the residents of Beniabagh and adjacent localities are apprehensive of another communal uprising. An elderly resident of Dalmandi, questioning the police role during the 1991 riots, said that members of the minority community were worried over recent statements of the BJP state chief on the temple issue.

Meanwhile, the SP (City) Rakesh Pradhan ruled out the possibility of communal tension in the city. He said that the present atmosphere was not like that of 1991. â€œThe police department is fully prepared to avert any untoward situation,â€� he added.

5,HC not to stay BSP's 'dhikkar' rally in city,"LUCKNOW: The high court here on Monday refused to stay dhikkar rally, scheduled to be held on September 28 next at Ambedkar Sthal, situated at VIP Road, behind Model Jail, Lucknow.

A division bench of High Court, comprising Justice Vishnu Sahai and Justice Vineet Saran, while directing the state government to file counter affidavit within four weeks in the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition, seeking direction for preventing the respondents from arguing the rally and cutting the green trees for preparing the rally ground, fixed October 21 next for hearing.

The PIL had been filed by a city lawyer SL Pandey on the ground that the state government had illegally occupied the land belonging to jail and cut the green trees standing there, without obtaining permission of competent authority. It was alleged by Pandey that the Bahujan Samaj Party was going to orgnise dhikkar rally on September 28 next and rally ground was being prepared on war footing.

Advocate general UP, SC Misra, assisted by Tanuja Somvanshi, additional chief standing counsel, appeared on behalf of the state to oppose the PIL.

7,TDP gets ready for elections,"HYDERABAD: The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is understood to have decided to put its rank and file into election mode, well ahead of other parties. According to senior party leaders, the leadership has taken this decision to ensure that the party hits the ground running, when polls are called in 2004.

Party president N Chandrababu Naidu, who held a meeting with senior party leaders on Sunday night, is learnt to have reviewed the political situation.

The awareness campaign being launched by the opposition Congress in the state, the statements being made by some leaders like Union minister of state Bandaru Dattatreya, which indicate that the BJP might break its alliance with the TDP on the eve of the assembly elections, were taken note of.

Though none of the TDP leaders was willing to comment on Dattatreyaâ€™s remarks, the party leadership feels that it should keep its cadres prepared to go alone, if the need arises.

Another important issue that figured during the meeting, was the growing dissidence within the partyâ€™s district units.

As a first step, the leadership has decided to nominate loyal senior workers to market committees, library societies and corporations. There are 103 posts vacant in market committees, 12 in library societies and 20 in state corporations.

The party, late on Sunday night, announced nominations to two market committees, Warangal and Khammam. Other nominations would be made soon. This could galvanise the party leaders, who until now were sulking into action.

In another major decision, the party decided that, henceforth, district party presidents would hold a public hearing every Monday, to receive representations from the people, categorise them and send them to the party headquarters.

Copies of the petitions would also be given to the district in-charge minister and ministers representing the district.

Talking to The Times of India, a senior minister said, the decision of holding public hearings at the district level, was the result of a suggestion made to the chief minister by some ministers, that the party and government should concentrate on building better rapport with the people.

Naidu, who is likely to visit Guntur on September 27, will review the functioning of the district unit, the party sources added.

9,ULFA backs protests by youths,"GUWAHATI: The banned United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) on Monday backed violent protests staged by a youth organisation in the local Doordarshan Kendra recently, terming it a reflection of the ''annoyance of the new generation of Assam against the attitude of occupation India''.The Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) had recently stormed the television station in the city, ransacking it and damaging property worth several lakhs to express their resentment against an alleged bid to deprive locals from a recruitment drive.''People have a right to use any mode of protest they choose to protest against the ruler as far as a civil society is concerned. ULFA greets such a struggling endeavour of the new generation,'' the ULFA said in the latest edition of its monthly newsletter, Freedom. Denying that it was trying to take political leverage from these events, the ULFA maintained that ''.... every conscious patriot of Assam knows about the rampant exploitation and the anti-Assam attitude of occupation India''. ''In one sense, as far as anybody considers himself a good Indian, then the grievances like ''job for local'' is totally utopian. Within such a fact, everybody is local within the parameter of India,'' the newsletter stressed. ''The present Assam is not a state within a state but an administration of an occupation state without an eco-political reality. Indeed India does not even consider our nationality as a unique one.''

10,Voter participation in J&K polls is rebuff to Pak: Gupta,"JAMMU: Terming voters participation in the first phase of Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls as ""rebuff to Pakistan"", Union Minister of State for Defence and senior BJP leader, Chaman Lal Gupta on Tuesday said the international community should take note of the enthusiasm exhibited by the people in the state and ask Islamabad to desist from indulging in cross-border terrorism.

Voters remarkable grit and determination in Monday''s polls has proved hollow the claims of Pakistan that Kashmiris were averse and indifferent to elections, Gupta said in a statement here.

He said the world powers should take serious note that the people of the state have registered their preference in favour of ballot instead of bullet and ask Pakistan to desist from meddling in Kashmir and also stop indulging in cross border terrorism.

Fairly good turnout of voters has convincingly proved that the people of the state were opposed to gun-culture, he said, adding they exercised their right of franchise in free manner defying threats to their lives.

Gupta said that all the 23 Assembly segments, which went to polls, were highly sensitive as terrorists held open threats to voters.

Expressing hope that the people of the state will keep up their morale and vote in large numbers in next three phases, he said successful conduct of polls will usher in a new era of peace and development.

An estimated 44 per cent of the electorate exercised their franchise in Monday''s Assembly polls that passed off by and large peacefully.

11,"Quit being adversarial on development issues, Advani tells parties","NEW DELHI: Apparently keeping in mind the tussle between Congress and BJP in Delhi, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Monday urged political parties to shed ""adversarial role"" on developmental issues.

""In a democracy, to take credit (for projects) has become part of the attitude of political parties, but there should be no adversarial role on developmental issues. The stress should be on synergy in every field of development and not adversarial roles,"" he said at a ceremony to flag off the Capital''s first Metro train for a trial run here.

Advani was apparently referring to the tussle between the Congress Government in Delhi and the opposition BJP to claim credit for initiating the Metro project.

However, earlier speakers played the ""credit game"" to the hilt. Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said it was the then Congress Chief Executive Councillor Jag Parvesh Chandra who dreamt and even prepared a report for the project. She did not even mention the name of Delhi BJP President Madan Lal Khurana, who was seated on the dais.

Union Urban Development Minister Ananth Kumar praised the Group of Ministers headed by Advani for steering the project through while Delhi Lt Governor Vijai Kapoor said as Chief Secretary he had prepared the draft project report in 1989.

However, all speakers gave ""full marks"" to E Sreedharan, Managing Director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation who was also the brain behind the Konkan Railway, for his dynamic execution of the present project.

17,Thousands of parcels lying in Kochi port since June,"KOCHI: Thousands of parcels shipped from UAE in 25x40 feet parcel containers are lying at the Kochi port, with the postal authorities declining to take responsibility for the cargo.

Port authorites said the port was only custodian of the cargo. The port effects delivery of the cargo on completion of the customs formalities, submission of delivery order issued by the steamer agents and collection of port dues, if any. So far, none has approached the port for delivery of the cargo after completion of formalities, they said.

The Indian postal department, which is the consignee, has to take care of cargo, get it examined and see if any duty is payable on them and then hand it over to the individual addressee, port sources say.

""It has not come to our possession,"" he said. He has taken up the matter with the Postal Directorate, New Delhi and their orders are awaited.

When it was pointed out that parcels had been sent under the new express parcel scheme of the UAE postal department after wide-ranging discussions with the Indian postal authorities, he said he had no information about the scheme.

18,Vigilance bureau arrests ex-HFC official,"CHANDIGARH: The Vigilance Bureau has arrested former additional general manager of Haryana Financial Corporation (HFC) Anurag Vashishta.

He has been remanded to judicial custody till September 25 by chief judicial magistrate, Ambala. The additional sessions judge, Ambala, on Monday dismissed his bail application.

While saying this here on Tuesday, a spokesman of the bureau said that Vashishta was wanted in case FIR No. 9 dated April 25, 2002, registered under Sections 406/420/467/468/471/120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, at bureauâ€™s police station in Ambala.

The bureau had registered the case against Vashishta and others following an inquiry in which it had found them guilty of awarding wrongful gain to various firms and shareholders by violating the rules and regulations during the period 1993-1996 and causing a wrongful loss of Rs 97.07 crore to the corporation.

21,J&K poll duty: 4 govt teachers’ unions to protest,"LUDHIANA: Strongly resenting the district administrationâ€™s step to force them to conduct poll duty in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) assembly elections, as many as four government teachers unions will organise a joint protest rally on September 19 in front of the mini-secretariat against the administration.

Talking to Times News Network, Punjab Government School Teachers Union general secretary Charan Singh Sarabha said they felt compelled to protest because the administration was violating the government instructions that the teachers including other government employees should be taken on voluntary basis for deputing them as polling/presiding officers during the second phase of J&K assembly elections.

The district unit of Punjab Government School Teachers Union, Government Teachers Union, Democratic Teachersâ€™ Front and Adhyapak Dal Punjab, would also participate in the rally, he added.

Sarabha said they had taken up the matter with senior state election commission officials at Chandigarh, recently, who, he claimed, had clarified that nobody would be forced to conduct poll duty.

Sarabha claimed they were also told that the earlier target of 400 government employees from Ludhiana district was no more required as the need was limited to 200 employees.

The teachers alleged that the administration was trying to cover up the lapse by asking them to furnish their options in writing when they went to the district election officials on Tuesday after receiving notices for their failure to turn up for the rehearsal scheduled on Monday.

The administration had issued notices to 230 employees including teachers for not attending the rehearsal.

As per the notices, the employees were asked to be present during the next rehearsal on September 19 failing which they would have to face legal action. When asked, the additional deputy commissioner (ADC) A K Sinha said they were acting as per the governmentâ€™s instructions.

At present, about 250 employees had submitted their options and there was no question of forcing anybody for the duty, he added. Sinha dismissed allegations of arbitrariness in the selection criteria adopted by them.

Since the teachers constituted major chunk of the government employees in the district so majority of the employees deputed were taken from their ranks, he said adding that they had preferred young employees for the job while the women employees were spared. Sinha added that some handicapped persons were enlisted by mistake but they were exempted from duty after the matter was brought to the administrationâ€™s notice.

However, the teachers contested this claim saying that many among them were above 50 years of age. They cited examples of 57 years old Baldev Krishan of Government Primary School, Hujra village, and Ramji Dass of Government Primary School, Dehlon, who is due to retire in May next.

The employees will leave for J&K on September 21 along with proper security and remain there till October 6.

22,Godhra killings: Probe panel to administer oath to all,"AHMEDABAD: Bringing to an end, the month-long controversy, Justice G T Nanavati and Justice K G Shah Commission of Inquiry has decided to administer oath to all the witnesses it examines, in the course of its inquiry into the Godhra carnage and its aftermath.

Heated exchanges had taken place between Commission chairman Justice G T Nanavati and advocate S H Qureshi, on the issue of latter''s application, seeking to administer oath to all the witnesses.

The examination of the witnesses by the Commission, which was stalled in the wake of arguments, resumed on Tuesday, after the Commission passed the order.

""In view of the wishes of all the learned advocates that all witnesses should be examined after administering oath, and in order to ensure smooth functioning of the Commission, we propose to frame a rule to the effect that all the witnesses, hereafter, shall be examined on oath,"" the order said. The Commission, however, quashed the application.

Qureshi, appearing on behalf of the Central Relief Committee, had filed an application raising an objection against the Commission, that it was not recording testimonies of the witnesses on oath. It contended that such a procedure was improper, invalid and illegal, as Section 4 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act required, that the person summoned to give testimony as a witness must be examined on oath.

Besides, if the testimonies of only some and not all the witnesses are taken on oath, then that will amount to discriminatory treatment and, therefore, that procedure would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

The Commission made it clear that the oath was not administered to witnesses because they were all public servants. It was argued by the lawyers that it was mandatory to administer oath to all. However, the Commission observed that the Section 4 is an enabling provision and decided that ""neither anything in the Section nor any good reason requires us to take such a view.""

It was also contended by senior advocate M C Bhatt, that if the witness is not examined on oath, it will not be possible for the Commission to take any action against him, if it is subsequently found that he had given false testimony before the Commission. But the Commission disagreed with this submission.

23,Delhi govt’s legislation derailed,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state governmentâ€™s decision to bring a separate Bill on Metro Rail has come a cropper with the Centre making it mandatory for all legislative proposals to be sent to the Lieutenant-Governor for approval before they are introduced in the legislative assembly.

As the state governmentâ€™s Bill would be contradictory to the Centreâ€™s Bill on the same subject, there are little chances that it would be approved by the L-G. Despite realising this, the state government has decided to draft the legislation and send it to the L-G. It would propose guidelines on operation and maintenance of the Metro.

Delhi state transport minister Ajay Maken said the city governmentâ€™s Bill on Metro may not be tabled in the Delhi legislative assembly, but it would still serve its purpose. â€˜â€˜In their Delhi Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Bill 2001, the Centre has circumvented the role of the Delhi state government,â€™â€™ he said.

â€˜â€˜Our Bill will not have any legal standing as compared to the Centreâ€™s Bill on the same subject, but we would still send it to L-G for the sake of moral accountability to the people of Delhi,â€™â€™ he added.

24,Govt says ready for late polls in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: In a dramatic flip- flop from its earlier stand, the Vajpayee government on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it had no legal objection to elections in Gujarat being held as late as the middle of January, 2003.

The government had forwarded a presidential reference to the court on the matter because it claimed the Election Commissionâ€™s decision to delay elections beyond October 6 â€” when six months would have elapsed since the last sitting of the assembly â€” would trigger a constitutional crisis.

However, Solicitor-General Harish Salve told the Constitution Bench that elections could be held upto six months after the dissolution of the state assembly in July. Salve said a council of ministers could continue in office even if an assembly was not constituted within six months of its last sitting.

Earlier, the Bench had asked Salve about the fallout of a circumstance, where elections could not be held under extraordinary circumstances and the gap between the sitting of previous House and the new House exceeded six months. Salve said if for some reason elections could not be held within six months, as provided under Article 174 of the Constitution, it was not necessary that Presidentâ€™s Rule be imposed.

Salve argued that the convention provided that the chief minister and his council of ministers could continue in office even after the assemblyâ€™s dissolution. But the government could not take any major policy decision.

When Salve said that all the constitutional functionaries should â€˜â€˜put their heads togetherâ€™â€™ to avoid any constitutional impasse otherwise â€˜â€˜democracy would perishâ€™â€™, the Bench observed: â€˜â€˜We are here to insulate democracy.â€™â€™

To the courtâ€™s query regarding the situation if a House was dissolved on completion of its full term and even then elections could not be held within the required period, Salve said: â€˜â€˜It is ECâ€™s duty to hold elections as provided under Article 324.â€™â€™

Salve said: â€˜â€˜This is not to be seen in the light of Gujarat alone. If such a situation arises at the Centre, will the EC say that it is not able to hold the elections?â€™â€™ Besides, Salve said, Chief Justice B N Kirpal, Justices V N Khare, K G Balakrishnan, Ashok Bhan and Arijit Pasayat had upheld ECâ€™s decision to hold elections by December.

The Bench on Tuesday fixed a deadline of September 26 for counsel representing the government, EC and national political parties to finish their arguments, saying it was an issue of great importance.

Seventeen police personnel were injured, including Borsad inspector G I Goswami. Two shops and a house were also set on fire. The state administration may have made claims about normalcy, but it took a minor accident - a scooterist hitting a boy - to start a riot. The scooter was being driven by a member of the minority community, while the boy belonged to the majority community.The incident took place at Kasipura, an area bordering Hindu-dominated Ram Padpadi and Syed Tekra, an area with a strong Muslim population. ""As soon as the boy was hit, stones began raining from Ram Padpadi area,"" said social worker Manabhai Malek of nearby Rabadi Chakla. Eyewitnesses said that the area was soon transformed into a battlefield with members of both the communities pelting stones till police intervened and fired in the air. The scooter was set ablaze.The area continued to simmer through the night and resulted in another outburst around 9 am on Tuesday when Mukesh Shah was stabbed while performing 'aarti' at a temple in Chokshi Bazaar. The stabbing led to yet another round of stone-pelting and a mob set a shop and a house on fire before police resorted to firing.""While Monday's incident was triggered by an accident, it was a stabbing incident that brought about renewed tension in Borsad on Tuesday. We clamped curfew as soon as clashes began and the situation is under control. A strong bandobast has been made as the immersion of Ganpati idols is slated for Friday. We are trying our best to ensure that the immersion goes off peacefully,"" Anand SP B D Vaghela told Times News Network.Borsad, which had witnessed communal violence during the peak of the post-Godhra riots, turned into a ghost town once again on Tuesday with desolate streets, lined with empty Ganpati pandals, being manned by police personnel as people peeked out of their houses.
