0,A fillip for slum re-development,"PUNE: In a major boost for slum rehabilitation schemes in the city, the state govt. on Thursday relaxed the â€œdensity normâ€� for builders.

Builders undertaking such schemes were hitherto required to pledge 500 tenements, per hectare of land, free of cost, to the government for rehabilitation.According to the latest decision, they will be required to pledge only 360. The PMC has been asked to invite objections and suggestions to the move.

Around 40 per cent of the cityâ€™s population lives in slums. The builders found the old density norm, financially viable, despite the incentive of 2.5 FSI.

1,LU to change selection process for teachers,"Lucknow: Major changes in the definition of the â€˜good academic recordâ€™, meant for the selection of the teachers, are on the anvil. The proposal to amend statutes in this regard has already been approved by the chancellor and it will be reported in the executive council meeting on May 29 for formal clearance.

As a step PhD degree holders will now get a five per cent relaxation in marks obtained at graduation level required for being selected as teacher in the Lucknow University.

LU spokesman Prof SK Dwivedi told this newspaper that till date the definition of good academic record was that the candidate must have second division in the intermediate level and 55 per cent marks at graduation level. However, the proposal slashed 55 per cent requirement in graduation to 50 per cent for the candidates having PhD degrees. The performance at intermediate level will not be considered in the selection process, he said.

Similarly, the requirement of 55 per cent marks at graduation level for the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates has been brought down to 50 per cent irrespective of the fact that they have a PhD degree or not, meaning SC/ST candidates with 50 per cent and above marks in graduation will qualify to apply for the post of a teacher, he said.

2,Gill sidelines Gujarat minister,"GANDHINAGAR: Minister of state for home Gordhan Zadaphia has reasons to sulk of late. Though it would seem the most inopportune time for the home minister of a state which has witnessed so much of violence to be sulking at this time, it hardly matters because thatâ€™s precisely the reason why Zadaphia is sulking â€” as nobody bothers about him any more.

Especially after K.P.S. Gillâ€™s arrival, the home minister seems to have gone into a shell. Not only was he not informed before hand of the arrival â€˜supercopâ€™ Gill, but he has not been consulted on any transfers of senior police officers as well as the thana-level inspectors, not even in his home ground of Ahmedabad.

BJP insiders say that Zadaphia has already told party president Jana Krishnamurthy that he wants a change of portfolio. A loyalist of former CM Keshubhai Patel, his differences with Modi are also becoming quite apparent.

In the latest manifestation of this friction, Modi has preferred to ignore Zadaphia while finalising his two-day programme to the border areas of Jamnagar and Kutch, starting from Friday. A senior police officer said: â€˜â€˜If Vajpayee can take Advani to Kashmir, one can only guess why Modi is not taking Zadaphia to Kutch.â€™â€™

Finding himself completely sidelined, Zadaphia instead decided to make his own tour programme to the two other border districts of Patan and Banaskantha from Thursday for a similar purpose.

Only recently, Zadaphia was one of the three ministers who boycotted a meeting called by Gill. Sources close to Zadaphia said the minister was unsure of protocol â€” on whether he should go to meet the CMâ€™s security adviser or the latter should have called on him.

There is another reason for Zadaphiaâ€™s discomfort with his portfolio. He rose from the VHP ranks to become the BJPâ€™s powerful general secretary, before being inducted by Modi into the ministry, purportedly at the VHPâ€™s insistence. In the present set-up, when scores of BJP and VHP workers are being arrested for riot-related charges, Zadaphia finds himself under considerable pressure. And yet he is helpless because the police obeys Gill.

Efforts by Times News Network over the last two weeks to draw out Zadaphia on issues pertaining to his department drew a blank. â€˜â€˜I will not talk on any subject at all,â€™â€™ is all he said.

3,National policy on hawkers soon,"KOLKATA: The Centre has created a task force to draw up a national policy on hawkers to be placed in Parliament by the year-end, Union minister of state for urban development and poverty alleviation Bandaru Dattatreya said in the city on Friday.

â€œThe security of livelihood is a major concern for hawkers. Identity cards for hawkers and registration of trade will be the first step,â€� he said.

At present, there are an estimated 10 million hawkers in the country and over 50 million people are dependent on hawking.

About 300 hawkers from various parts of India and other south and southeast Asian countries were participating in a three-day conference which began on Friday. About 30 delegates came from abroad.

Apart from sharing experiences, the delegates will try to formulate action plans which they will present to their governments. â€œWe are looking at providing bank loans to hawkers,â€� the minister said amidst applause.

Writer Mahasveta Devi, trade unionist Gurudas Dasgupta and state PWD minister Amar Chowdhury felt that though hawkers were entitled to earn their livelihood, there should be a comprehensive government policy to regulate their trade. Besides, hawkers should not inconvenience people who use footpaths and carriageways.

4,Auto unions protest police ‘excesses’,"HYDERABAD: Several auto drivers unions have criticised the detention of autorickshaws by the city traffic police for breaking rules and the other irregularities.

The new â€˜systemâ€™ of detaining autos and collecting penalties by the police has been termed as another form of â€˜blackmailâ€™ by the unions.

The traffic police, in last two days, seized about 700 autos in the city. Of these, 350 autos were seized near the Goshamahal stadium, 200 near Tank Bund and 150 near Secunderabad.

Auto Drivers Joint Action Committee convener Mohd Amanullah Khan said the detention of vehicles until the fine was paid was affecting the livelihood of many families.

Khan said it was legally sufficient to seize the documents of a vehicle in case of any irregularity. The owners and drivers of the vehicles can pay the fine within seven days at the traffic police control room after the cases against them are registered, he said.

He said the traffic police had cobbled different contradictory and irrelevant sections of the Motor Vehicle Act and rules just to collect heavy fines and harass autodrivers.

For instance, Section 122 pertaining to wrong parking, Section 184 related to rash and negligent driving and Section 179 regarding disobedience of traffic rules are applied in most of the cases so as to extract maximum fine amount, he said.

Meanwhile, the AP Auto and Trolley Drivers Union has demanded that the government should immediately put an end to the seizure of autos.

The union has decided to hold a massive dharna on May 27 at the Hyderabad Collectorate if the government fails to intervene in the issue.

5,Ten factionists arrested,"VIJAYAWADA: The Giddaluru police in Prakasam district arrested 10 factionists of Burujupalli and Kottakota villages on Friday and seized five guns, one sickle, eight bombs and 22 live and six empty cartridges from their possession.

Prakasam district superintendent of police Kumar Vishwajeet told reporters in Ongole on Friday that rivalry between the dominant Reddy and Yadava castes had vitiated normal life in these villages since 1998. It all started with Sesha Reddy resorting to extortions from cotton traders in the region in 1998.

Kompanna, belonging to the Yadava caste, too took to extortion.

This sparked off a row between the two castes which soon led to violence with each group committing murders.

In all, 11 cases were registered against the two groups, including five cases of murder, Vishwajeet said. Following police raids, the factionists fled to nearby forests.

6,Urban development authority to sell lands,"VIJAYAWADA: The Vijayawada- Guntur-Tenali- Mangalagiri Urban Development Authority (VGTMUDA) is all set to sell some prime sites in various parts of Vijayawada to secure over Rs 12 crore.

The money thus earned will be spent on various development works in Vijayawada, according to VGTMUDA chairperson Kolli Sharada.

The revenue department has handed over to the VGTMUDA 6,000 sq yd of land around the Kasturibaipet hillock, two acre of land on the Patamata High School Road, eight acre at Payakapuram and some excess land at Patamata. This follows an order from chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu wherein the revenue and irrigation departments were directed to hand over excess lands to the VGTMUDA for disposal.

The money thus secured is proposed to be spent on development works in Vijayawada as part of the Rs 250-crore Vijayawada Development Plan.

Accordingly, the revenue department issued orders recently handing over all excess lands to the VGTMUDA, Sharada said.

The VGTMUDA hopes to garner Rs 6 crore by disposing off the site around the Kasturibaipet hillock, Rs 3 crore from the land on the Patamata High School road and Rs 2.5 crore on the Payakapuram land.

Another Rs 50 lakh will be secured by selling other vacant sites at Patamata. All the houses built illegally on the hilltop would be removed to facilitate sale of the land. Meanwhile, the VGTMUDA chairperson wrote a letter to major irrigation minister Kadiyam Srihari to expedite the process of handing over the irrigation department lands in different parts of Vijayawada to the VGTMUDA for disposal.

Though it was decided in January itself to hand over the irrigation department lands to the Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali- Mangalagiri Urban Development Authority, the relevant government order (GO) was not issued.

8,Assam creates investment friendly climate,"GUWAHATI: The Assam government had received inquiries from investors outside the state in the last one year regarding setting up of various industries at a total investment of Rs 300 crore thanks to its improved industrial climate, state''s Industries Minister Pradyut Bordoloi said.

The minister told reporters here on Saturday that multinationals like Proctor and Gamble, Smith-Kline, Hindustan Lever, LG and others were showing interest in investing in the state.

He attributed this to the government''s creation of an investment friendly climate by improving the law and order situation, facilitating industrial development and generating employment opportunities. This had largely allayed apprehensions among the investors wanting to invest in the state, he added.

During the year the government had also taken steps to expedite early completion of the ongoing infrastructure projects, creating investment friendly climate, developing skilled manpower, promoting interstate and international trade, offering incentives for setting up industries.

The industry department also took steps to set up facilities for setting up industries and taking benefits under the N-E Industrial Policy.

9,JD(S) upset over Hubli deputy mayor's arrest,"HUBLI: The arrest of Deputy Mayor Sunil Patil, following a tiff with HDMC Commissioner V.M. Kulkarni, on Friday has upset the Janata Dal(S), with the party demanding the transfer of the Commissioner. It has also made a strong appeal for the suspension of Chief Health Officer, Padma Desai. The JD(S) had called an emergency meeting to discuss the issue. Meanwhile, Sunil Patil who has been released on bail threatened to stage a dharna demanding the arrest of Kulkarni against whom he had lodged a counter complaint with the police.

JD(S) leader, Basavaraj Bommai, while terming the incident as unfortunate, said: ``The deputy mayor who had taken a pregnant women to the HDMC Hospital was shocked to find the duty doctor absent. When this was the situation, was it wrong to call the Chief Health Officer'''', he asked.

Bommai said Padma Desai misguided the commissioner by a complaint that Sunil Patil was drunk, in order to shift the blame from the duty doctor who was absent. He wanted to know how Sabina Khazi had a normal delivery when the HDMC Hospital of Dharwad suggested shifting her to another hospital for a Caesarean operation.

``It is natural that an elected representative will be upset with such officials. The police also took a unilateral decision of arresting the deputy mayor'''', he said demanding immediate action against the health department staff and commissioner.

A resident of Maratha Colony of Dharwad, S. Mallanna Gouda, wanted to know what would have happened if something serious had happened to the pregnant women. He alleged that the duty doctor D. Chavan was in Hubli when he was supposed to be in the hospital.

10,Bypoll a referendum on Krishna govt: JD(S),"MYSORE: State JD(S) chief Siddaramaiah on Saturday said that the Narasimharaja bypoll would be a ""referendum"" on the working of the Congress government headed by Krishna and would show how opposition is shaping up in Karnataka.

At a press meet here, expressing confidence about his party candidate winning the election, he said the Congress government in the state has ""miserably"" failed to fulfil the aspirations of the state people and failed to perform on all fronts.

""The economy is in bad shape, the cheques issued by the government are being dishonoured by the treasury and collecting taxes in advance to pay the salaries of the government employees,"" he said, demanding a white paper on the state''s economy if Congress leaders are right and honest in their claims on finances.

He said people are fed up with the ``non-performance'''' of Congress government and false promises being made by its leaders. This is the reason why the JD(S) candidate is receiving an overwhelming response from the voters in this constituency and victory is going to be of the Janata Parivar candidate,"" he added.

In reply to a question, he said even the economic survey report published by the state government itself depicts a grim picture of the state finances and a revenue loss to the tune of Rs 1,400 crore.

Accusing the Congress leaders of indulging in unlawful acts and threatening the voters and leaders working for their party, Siddaramaiah said Congress leaders who have realised the situation are resorting to dhamki (intimidation) politics.

""If law-enforcing agencies ensure a free and fair poll without any scope for unlawful activities such as rigging and proxy voting, JD(S)''s victory is a foregone conclusion,"" he added.

Criticising the Congress leaders for allegedly making personal comments against their opponents, JD(S) chief said ``the people will teach them a lesson''''.

12,"Indiatimes, govt tie up to put results on cellphones","NEW DELHI: You don''t need to run to a manicurist after your exam results are out. Indiatimes and the Kerala government have cut down the nail-biting time. Just use your dad''s mobile phone to find out how you''ve done.

The nation''s leading portal tied up with the Kerala government on Saturday to provide the Senior School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) results on cellular phones through its 8888 service.

The results were made available from 11 am on Saturday. Students can find out how they have fared by simply sending an SMS to 8888. The text of the message should read: ""SSLC Registration No."" (e.g. SSLC 1234). A reply would be sent within 10 seconds, showing the marks, and if the student had obtained a distinction, passed or failed.

""The new service brings the communication revolution closer home. We will expand the scope of the service to other states with similar tieups. 8888 is already very popular with the people, and this is another effort to make life easier for them,'''' said Mahendra Swarup, CEO, Times Internet.

This is the first time the state government is using a cellphone-based service to declare exam results. The tie-up comes a year after it started putting the results online on its website Keralaeducation.org.

A state government official said the new service scored even over the Internet in terms of ease of access and cost. ``There were six lakh candidates, and we wanted to reach everyone,'''' said V P Joy, director, Public Instruction.

About 25,000 requests were received in the first two hours of the launch itself. There are two operators and about four lakh cellular phone users in the state.

With the tieup, Kerala, which boasts of the highest literacy rate in the country, has taken the lead in tapping the latest methods of communication to serve the people better. The Central Board for Secondary Education is likely to use the service next year.

As more states take Kerala''s cue, there is sure to be one beneficiary - the student; and probably one loser - the local manicurist.
