""we would like to ask the nda government as to what action it has taken regarding building of high dam in nepal, which is the ultimate solution to floods in bihar?,"" they asked. the rjd leaders recalled that at the recent all-party meeting, the nda partners had walked out of the meeting without offering a single positive suggestion. on the contrary, the rjd had participated in the all-party meet called by the union minister, c p thakur. the youth wing of nationalist congress also dubbed the bandh as a flop. however, it also criticised rjd for holding a `picnic' at delhi in the name of ""mahadharna"". senior congress leader ram swaroop ram stated that the bandh call given by the nda leaders had been rejected by the people. several youth leaders of rjd have also issued statements declaring the bandh to be a failure. however, nda leaders maintained that the bandh was a complete success. bjp leader sushil kumar modi stated that the success of the bandh reflected the lack of faith in the laloo-rabri regime and that people were fed up of daily incidents of kidnapping, murder, rape and loot going on in the state. he demanded central intervention. lok janshakti leaders, narandra singh and pashupati paras, observed that the people of bihar, reeling under drought and flood, had joined hands to make the bandh a success. they alleged that the police had resorted to lathicharge at several places on the bandh supporters. they stressed that the bandh was a reflection of the complete rejection of the laloo-rabri regime by the people of the state. jd(u) leader ganesh prasad yadav has called the bihar bandh historic and a strong protest by the people against the police firing in aurai, kidnappings, murders, rapes and extortion from traders. he said that the state government should quit on moral grounds.

""ram vilas paswan's supporters have done their job at hajipur and ensured that vehicles do not cross the zone"", stated a bus driver. a magistrate and armed guards posted at the bridge wore a bored look as vehicles refused to trickle in. the scenario at the patna junction was depressing. with majority of three-wheelers, taxis and rickshaw pullers off the road, passengers arriving at patna junction had to wait for long durations for a vehicle to go towards their destination. the lucky ones were asked to pay more than the usual rates.

""we think paraplegia patients should not be given the same amount of rs 50,000 as other permanently disabled ones,"" sethi said. ""there should be a permanent source of monthly allowance for them.""
