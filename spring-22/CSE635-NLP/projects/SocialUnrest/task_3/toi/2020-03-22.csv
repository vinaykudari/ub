2,Chemists to observe bandh on March 25,"HYDERABAD: Members of the AP Chemists and Druggists Association (APCDA) will observe a statewide bandh on March 25 to protest the introduction of value added tax (VAT) from April 1.

â€œMedicines are now available to the consumer on maximum retail price (MRP) with about seven per cent local taxes. But with the VAT regime, tax would be added at every point of sale and medicines will be sold to consumers on MRP plus an extra 16.75 per cent local taxes,â€� APCDA president Ramesh Chandra Gupta told reporters on Saturday.

He demanded that every pack of medicine should be available to the consumer at the MRP inclusive of all taxes. â€œMedicines are life saving commodities and their prices are controlled by the Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO) under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.

So medicines should be available at a uniform and cheaper price with a maximum of four per cent tax all over the country,â€� APCDA general secretary N S Sree Ramulu said. He said the VAT rules were â€˜draconianâ€™ as the penalties for non-compliance or for small errors in trade could be from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1 lakh and imprisonment up to 12 months. The VAT on medicines should be collected at first point so that the government gets the revenue in advance instead of collecting at different levels causing inconvenience to traders, APCDA treasurer Parmeshwarlal Modi said.

With the introduction of VAT on medicines, there would be no option but to stop purchase of medicines which would create shortage of life saving drugs causing hardships to patients and 30,000 dependent traders, he said. In case of any emergency on the bandh day, patients or their families can contact R C Gupta on 98490-37433 or Dr Ghisulal Jain at 56889923 or N S Sree Ramulu at 9440052106.

3,Mob protesting youth's killing damages shops,"PATNA: A group of local residents damaged a number of shops in Afzal locality near Sharif Colony under Pirbahore police station following the refusal of shopkeepers to down their shutters. Local residents were protesting against the killing of a 20-year-old youth Hasan Imam, a resident of Lalbagh locality. Meanwhile, all the shops located in Kunkun Singh Lane, Ashok Rajpath and Ramana road remained closed till late afternoon.

Earlier, Imam was stabbed and injured on Friday. Later he succumbed to his injuries the same night. Trouble began in the area following the spread of report about the youth''s death in this locality. According to local residents, the youth was innocent. They also blamed the local police for patronising the criminals involved in this incident. Protesting against the killing, local residents started forcing the shopkeepers to close their shops.

Later, the administration tried to control the situation. The administration has deployed a large number of policemen in Sharif Colony and its adjoining parts. The administration''s anti-riot vehicle Vajra remained parked in Bhikhana Pahari area. The police have arrested one Chhotu alias Shamim, main accused in the case.

4,"Alert outlaws, happy-go-lucky police","GAYA: In December 1994, the Anchal guards deputed at the Tekari block office were caught off guard when the MCC attacked the block premises and almost leisurely walked away with six rifles. Not only the Anchal guards were caught napping, a few of them were actually watching a movie at an illegal video parlour in Tekari Bazar when they were supposed to be on duty.

About two years later, the MCC once again organised a daredevil operation inside the Tekari police station in which besides losing arms, the Gaya police lost four of their men, including ASI Parshuram Singh and head constable Gena Ram. The incident took place on January 20, 1996 at 3.45 in the afternoon. Like the previous incident, this time too, the policemen were taken off guard and quite a few of them were absent from duty without any valid reason.

Again after 20 months, on September 17, 1997, the Gaya police lost no less than 17 rifles and three men in a daylight MCC operation on the outskirts of the Gaya town, less than 5 km to the north-west of the district police headquarters. This time, too, subsequent inquiry found that a dozen policemen were away from duty doing shopping and performing sundry acts in the township, leaving behind their arms at the mercy of the extremist leftists.

The play was repeated, this time in full moonlight at Lodipur on Tuesday last. The policemen lost 15 rifles and about 1,500 rounds of ammunition. Notwithstanding the claim of superintendent of police Raveendran Sankaran that during a check conducted less than eight hours before the incident all the police personnel deputed at the Lodipur picket were found present, reliable sources say that when the PW men raided the police picket only three of the 20 policemen deputed at the picket were there to receive the extremists. The result was obvious. The three men virtually gifted their own arms as well as the arms of their absentee colleagues.

On their part, the extremists displayed compassion and spared the lives of the three policemen present at the Lodipur police picket. The minor injury received by the policemen during the operation also came as a saving grace for the cops, as they can now claim to have resisted the extremists before surrendering the arms.

IG police A C Verma, during his Gaya visit on Friday, is learnt to have indicated that if during the departmental inquiry it was established that the policemen really deserted the picket to indulge in Holi revelry elsewhere, strong action would be taken against them. It is to be seen how the senior officials negotiate the pressure bound to be mounted by the police union to save the errant members of the force.

5,Thousands of US protesters hit the streets,"SAN FRANCISCO: Thousands of anti-war protesters have taken to the streets in cities across America for a second consecutive day, sparking scores of arrests.

San Francisco, where police arrested a record number of more than 1,300 people on Thursday, was once again the scene of noisy protests on Friday, though of far less intensity. Police said they detained about 200 people by late afternoon and expected more arrests into the evening.

A rally in New York''s Times Square rally was much smaller and tamer than Thursday''s, with only 150 protesters on another rainy day. Organisers expect tens of thousands will march on Saturday. San Francisco and other cities planned large Saturday rallies, as well.

The Friday protests against President Bush''s decision to wage war against Iraq were the latest wave around the world that extended from Asia, across West Asia, Europe, and the US to its western shores.

Following a Thursday anti-war protest in Chicago with as many as 10,000 demonstrators, hundreds of protesters turned out Friday morning there to surround a federal office building. They lay down in front of the building entrances and disrupted rush-hour traffic.

6,India not to boycott hi-tech US military equipment,"NEW DELHI: Defence Minister George Fernandes on Sunday ruled out India boycotting hi-tech US military equipment in the wake of its unilateral action against Iraq.

Asked whether the Vajpayee government would boycott the equipment it has been purchasing from the United States in the wake of its attack on Iraq, he said without the use of Weapon Locating Radars, it would not be possible to protect Indian soldiers from suffering losses.

""If we boycott them it will not be in the interest of our national security. We will be asking our soldiers to fight it out in the open,"" he told a private television channel.

Fernandes said sometimes on a particular issue circumstances develop between two countries in such a way that one had to put principles and ideologies in the backburner.

He said the whole world had accepted that the war against Iraq was a unilateral action by the US which in a way rendered the United Nations meaningless and there was pain in everyone''s heart with regard to the future of the UN.

Asked about the role of the NDA government, the defence minister said India was prepared to extend cooperation to Iraq in providing relief to the war hit people, especially children. ""The government is prepared to offer its assistance the moment such a request is received,"" he added.

8,"Rehabilitate tribals, NCW tells govt","KOZHIKODE: Indicting the Kerala government for failing to provide adequate security and basic amenities to tribals in Wyanad, the National Commission for Women on Sunday urged the A K Antony government to initiate steps to rehabilitate the adivasis, ""who have lost everything"".

The commission, which concluded its three-day visit to the state on Sunday, said the UDF government''s handling of the Muthanga tribals'' issue was ""not satisfactory"" as adivasi women and children were subjected to ""severe torture.""

Commission member, Nafiza Hussain, said here that although the government could not be blamed for total failure in dealing with the issue, ""it is clear that no concrete steps have been taken to promote their (the tribals'') welfare"".

Tribal women had been subjected to atrocities, including molestation, by policemen, she said, adding the government should rush medical care to the tribal hamlets in the district. The Government should also arrange counselling to the mentally-shattered tribal women, she said.

A four-member team of the commission, headed by NCW chairperson Poornima Advani, visited Wyanad district on Saturday and recorded statements of women living in tribal hamlets. They also visited Muthanga, the scene of clashes involving tribals and the police and subsequent police firing on Feb 19, in which a police constable and a tribal were killed.

Talking to Times News Network over phone from Lucknow, principal secretary to the governor Shambunath categorically denied that Raj Bhawan had received any such complaint from the said advocate or from any other source. â€œThis has not come to my noticeâ€�, he informed. Other senior officials too contradicted the claims of Sengar who for the last three days has been feeding the local media on this news.

Local Hindi dailies had published news items attributed to the one-time lawyer of the MLA on Saturday in which Vijay Sengar had claimed to have faxed a onepage SOS to the governor. According to the faxed message, the legislator Raja Bhaiyya having nasal congestion as one of the bones in his nose was growing and he was not getting medical attention.

A curious twist was added to the ongoing drama when Senger went a step ahead on Saturday and told the local press that the governor had responded to his petition and had ordered an inquiry.

13,LLR Hospital abuzz with political activity,"KANPUR: Deserted alleys of LLR Hospital has now-a-days crowded with politicians.

From the local level Bharatiya Janata Party workers to senior BJP leaders from Lucknow can be seen here camping for hours here at the hospital as everyone wants to maintain proximity with the state party chief Vinay Katiyar who has come here for the treatment of his wife.

The district office-bearers, local MLAs and senior state leaders including Om Prakash Singh and state incharge of party Kalraj Mishra have paid visits at the hospital. Vinay Katiyarâ€™s wife was admitted in the incentive care unit of the LLR hospital on Thursday last.

Since, most of the time Katiyar remains present in the hospital, BJP workers from Kanpur city, dehat and adjoining areas also reach here to meet him. When so many political leaders assemble there, how can they refrain from political discussions. After formal talks about Katiyarâ€™s wife, these leaders spent time on political chats.

In fact, there seems to be a stiff competition among the BJP workers to spend maximum time with the state president as the local office-bearers visit the hospital twice or thrice a day. Hospital staff members are equally thrilled to have a VIP patient and her VIP visitors.

The sudden flow of the politicians at the hospital has revived the the past glory of LLR Hospital.

â€˜â€˜In the past, many prominent people used to come here for treatment. It seems old days are back, said a doctor. On the other hand, some doctors also complained that heavy flow of visitors was creating unnecessary hardships for other patients and their attendants.

Sources in the hospital said that some overenthusiastic supporterâ€™s of Katiyar entered into the ICU without taking off their shoes.

However, no one can dare to speak against it.
