1,Elections ensure cheer for farmers,"CHANDIGARH: With the Lok Sabha elections round the corner, it has been a mixed bag of luck for farmers in Punjab.

If the government bent over backwards to please them with quick and efficient procurement of wheat, the nature has not been benevolent enough to give them the desired yield.

In all 73.5 lakh tonnes of wheat had been procured till Monday without a noise of protest from farmers in any part of the state.

With just three or four more days left to complete the procurement, the hyper-sensitised official machinery made sure this time that farmers faced no inconvenience at the mandis and their stocks were lifted quickly and payments released promptly.

The deputy commissioners were delivered express orders to make sure that the operations were conducted smoothly. In an effort to keep farmers in good humour, the government this time not only advanced the procurement exercise by almost 10-15 days, but made sure that the Centre released the credit limit in time. Almost the time when the state government started with procurement it had the credit limit of Rs 5,300 crore in its pocket ready for farmers.

In normal course the RBI releases the limit much later after the procurement has started. While the FCI was tardy in lifting the stocks, the government agencies, including the food and supplies department, Markfed and Punsup, were quick to make up for that.

However, regardless of the government''s efforts to bring cheer to farmers in the election season, it is the marginal decline in the yield this year which would rather be a cause of concern.

Official sources confirmed that in at least seven to 10 districts, including Amritsar, Ferozepur, Patiala, Sangrur and Faridkot, the yield has declined by five to ten per cent this year.

As a result, the officials feel that the state might not be able to touch the target of procuring 90 lakh tonnes of wheat this season, which, incidentally would be almost 10 lakh tonnes less than the yield recorded in 2002.

Officials feel that the decline this year was as much attributed to climatic conditions as to the variety of seeds used by farmers.

2,When still rules the countryside,"AMRITSAR: Come elections and the bootleggers are a happier lot. With more and more political parties using liquor to woo voters, bootleggers are making a killing these days. Their stills have once again started dotting the countryside, brewing desi liquor, without the fear of being caught by the police.

Surprisingly, even the raw material is being supplied free of cost. Though short-lived, but this election bonanza brings cheers to them.

The TNN team spotted one such still in a village falling in Amritsar Lok Sabha constituency on Tuesday. However, only after persistent persuasion, the persons running the still agreed to talk. ""Aaj ithae hain, te kal ithae nahi labhangae. Sanu koi farak nahin pena hai (tomorrow you will not find us here, so doesn''t make any difference to us),"" said one of them.

They can wink at the police as they allegedly have the support of political parties.

However, his intrepid accomplice, seeking anonymity, said that they were being supplied with raw material for brewing desi liquor by workers of different political parties. Flags of both the Congress and the BJP were fluttering atop their still.

People come at the ''bhatti'', gulp down a glass or two of ''lahan'' with a pinch of salt or snacks and appreciate the political leaders for freebies. Some, raising a toast in the name of parties, say it is an illegal and an unethical practice to distribute liquor during elections, but justify their own drinking on the plea that ""we never asked them to distribute free liquor"".

A villager said, ""This is a boom time for us, so why not cash in on it. Who will care for us later.""

No political party admitted that it was using alcohol to lure voters, but instead blamed other party for resorting to such tactics.

However, Raghunandan Lal Bhatia, Congress nominee from Amritsar, said that it was very unfortunate that such a method was being adopted to woo voters.

""In my political career, I have never ever resorted to such means to gain votes,"" he said. BJP nominee Navjot Sidhu asked to bring the proof that his party was indulging in distributing free liquor.

3,"Off stumps, no balls and yorkers in polls","HYDERABAD: The stupendous success of Indian cricket team in Pakistan appears to have cast its spell in electioneering in Andhra Pradesh with aspirants trying to woo the voters -youth in particular- with cricket kits.

Trying a ''new line'', netas are charting unusual ''lengths'' to play a different ball game by distributing cricket kits to ''in swing'' voter''s support in their favour, while the politcal rivals were crying ''no ball'' by tipping off police and media.

Cricket kit bags with party symbols and candidates'' names have been seized at various places in the state giving a new dimension to the art of luring voters.

Tirupati Lok Sabha candidate Chinta Mohan was trapped plumb before the wicket when police, tipped by BJP workers, seized kit bags yesterday with the party symbol, contestant''s photo and an appeal to elect him.

BJP alleged that Congress candidate was distributing school bags and cricket kit bags to woo the voters.

The pitch was equally bouncy in Nalgonda district, where police sized truck loads of cricket kits belonging to TDP candidate for Tungaturthi assembly seat, S Vekateswara Rao.

This time the wickets were spreadeagled with the yorker bowled by CPM, the main rival of TDP.

4,Your ‘govt-recognised’ school may be unauthorised,"MUMBAI: The false claim in this case is not even in the fine print. Several suburban city schools claim they are â€˜government-recognisedâ€™ in big bold letters but are actually unauthorised.

The number of such schools, most of which conduct classes up to Std IV or Std IX, or even Std I, is estimated to be between 200 and 400. Unsuspecting parents who send their children to these schools, find themselves in a spot when they later try to get them admitted elsewhere.

â€œDozens of parents come to us but we cannot admit them, as they are from unauthorised schools in this area,â€™â€™ says Agnus Salian, principal of St Anthonyâ€™s school in Malad. Indeed, Malad would appear to be something of a hot spot for such spurious operations.

Salian cites as examples St Illiya Sarawat High School and Mother Teresa High school, both of which operate from a chawlâ€” in addition, there are schools such as St Lords High School and Sir JP High School. All the schools are run from dingy dumps, and their functioning is haphazard, given their poorly trained teachers and the fact that they are run like a business venture.

While some schools are unrecognised to begin with, several have government recognition initially but continue functioning for years after losing it. In other schools, certain classes lose recognition, but donâ€™t inform parents about the fact.

For instance, the government recognition of Std III and Std IV of a school in Bandra (W) expired in May 2003, but classes continue and parents are in the dark. â€œSince the school is only up to Std IV, these students will have to join other schools thereafter,â€™â€™ says an official of the school on condition of anonymity.

â€œThat will be difficult, as schools in the locality are aware that these students are from the unrecognised classes of this school.â€™â€™ Unrecognised schools which have classes upto Std X make their students fill forms through another school for the board examination, allege sources.

While the BMCâ€™s education department is aware of the exact number of unauthorised schoolsâ€”it comes up with a list every year which is not confidentialâ€”officials refuse to divulge any information. This, despite education officer BRF Rehmanâ€™s assurance that he will make the list available to TNN.

To curb this menace, the PTA United Forum served a legal notice on themunicipal commissioner and the principal secretary of the school education department, demanding immediate action against unauthorised schools.

â€œTheir continuing existence is not possible without the cooperation of the state and municipal authorities,â€™â€™ alleges Arundhati Chavan, president of the forum.

Mr Rehman says the BMC had already served a show cause notice to â€œall the concerned school managementsâ€™â€™. â€œThose who have not complied will be served a notice again,â€™â€™ he says.

5,Madrasah students protest in front of Writers' Bldgs,"KOLKATA: Police lathicharged about 50 Madrasah students, who staged a protest before the Writers'' Buildings during busy office hours on Tuesday, demanding immediate withdrawal of the Kiwi Committee report on Madrasah education in West Bengal.

Thirty-five slogan shouting students of the West Bengal Madrasah Students'' Union led by its Secretary Saiddul Islam were arrested when they gathered in front of the Central Gate of the state secretariat and refused to budge.

The students alleged that the A R Kiwi Committee Report would affect the state of madrasah education in West Bengal.

Among other things, the group demanded that the madrasah examinations of Fazil, Kamil and Mamtazzul be made at par with the Higher Secondary, Bachelors'' degree and PG degree exams.

The students also demanded that the 225-year-old Calcutta Madrasah College be given the status of a deemed university.

Challenging the authenticity of the Kiwi committee report, the students demanded that another committee of Muslim intellectuals be formed to make a rational assessment of the state of Madrasah education in West Bengal.

6,"Software tax sops to continue, says govt","NEW DELHI: The finance ministry on Tuesday clarified that there has been no withdrawal of any tax incentives for software companies. The governmentâ€™s policy of providing the tax holiday for software units under Section 10A and 10B of the Income-Tax Act continues unchanged.

Fielding a volley of questions about recent income-tax notices to a number of software firms, including Wipro and TCS, making tax demands of hundreds of crores of rupees, revenue secretary Vineeta Rai told reporters that there could have been an â€˜â€˜interpretation problemâ€™â€™ in the case of individual firms where the assessing officer may not have been in agreement with the tax exemption claimed by a company.

â€˜â€˜In case of Wipro, they have chosen to go in appeal against the assessment order. A judicial process is on. We will wait to see the outcome of this process and if there is any grey area, we could then consider taking appropriate steps,â€™â€™ Rai said.

The chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), P L Singh, said, â€˜â€˜We have not changed any of the provisions of law which grants tax holiday for software units located in software development parks and technology parks. Neither have we issued any circular introducing any change in the manner software firms may be taxed.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Paying taxes is not an act of charity,â€™â€™ said chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri, when a reporter pointed out that the association of software firms, Nasscom, had taken up this as an â€˜â€˜industry issueâ€™â€™ for reddressal.

â€˜â€˜The sovereign has the right to take what is due as tax under the law and there is a judicial process for interpreting the law,â€™â€™ Lahiri added.

8,Tripura polls under tight security cover,"AGARTALA: The Army has upped patrolling in Tripura to counter possible insurgent attacks, as the state goes to polls in both its constituencies on Thursday.

More than a crore voters here are eligible to vote and there are six candidates in each of the two constituencies. Official sources said 128 polling stations of the total 2,372 have been classified as ''hyper-sensitive.''

""We do not anticipate much trouble this time because two important factions of the NLFT insurgents have agreed to a ceasefire,"" senior officials said.

""Moreover, the militants in Tripura do not take as much interest during parliamentary polls as they do during Assembly elections. Nevertheless, we do not want to leave anything to chance and tight security cover has been thrown across the state.""

ATTF, the other insurgent group, has called for a poll boycott and there has been heavy security deployment in its strongholds.

Air surveillance patrols have been added to the ones on the ground. The BSF has also increased its vigil, with the frontier to be sealed for the day.

In 18 polling stations located in high hills and deep inaccessible areas, the election staff had to be flown in by helicopters.

There are also 14 remote polling booths, mostly in Dhalai district, where the poll staff could reach only by walking, in cases covering 26 km.
