0,FB minister raps CPM ‘takeover’ of university,"siliguri: state agriculture minister and forward bloc state secretary kamal guha has once again openly complained against the cpm for taking the north bengal university under its full control. guha is irked because on december 21, the centre for studies in local languages and culture of the university was inaugurated by state minister and cpm leader dinesh dakua. other ministers invited to the occasion also belonged to the cpm. reportedly, guha feels that the appointment of seikh rahim mandal as director of the centre is unjustified as he belongs to hoogly. to conduct the study of languages and culture of 117 ethnic groups of north bengal, a vast knowledge and expertise in 'local soil' is required, feels guha. he said that though the demand for the centre had been raised by his party, fb ministers were bypassed at the opening ceremony and instead, three cpm ministers of north bengal were invited. civil defence minister srikumar mukherjee, social welfare minister biswanath choudhury and guha himself were not invited. guha cited all this as clear indication of the cpm's big brotherly attitude in all state government agencies and academic institutions. nbu registrar t. k. chatterjee countered, we cannot comment on the political part of guha's complaint, but on the functional part, he might have made some mistake. justifying the appointment of mandal, chatterjee said that mandal had attained great expertise in north bengal's ethnic culture with his study and experience over the past 20 years. on the question of invitation, he said, we never call all ministers from north bengal to our functions. ashok bhattacharjee, dinesh dakua and jogesh burman helped us a lot during the setting up of the centre and so we invited them. we cannot help it if all of them happen to be in the cpm.

1,"Criminals a part of politics, says Thakre","lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh and bjp chief kalraj mishra may have said ''no'' to criminals, but kushbhau thakre, former bjp national president, minces no words in accepting that criminals are a necessity in a political system. ''it is a political compulsion to include criminals in the party,'' he said here on monday. but, in the same vein, he said the bjp was still better than other political parties. ''if criminals were there in our party, we had tried to get rid of them,'' he added. in a freewheeling interview, thakre, who is also in-charge of up affairs, said: ''i cannot guarantee that criminals would not be given ticket for the next assembly elections. we will try to eliminate them. but one thing should be borne in mind that no one lives in isolation. we are getting leaders from this society. and all of them are not sadhus.'' thakre's remarks comes at a time when political leaders of all hues are crying hoarse against criminalisation of politics. the samajwadi party had suspended two of its mps for their criminal antecedents. thakre said in politics, situations arises when one has to make compromises. the bjp faced a similar situation in 1996 when the former governor romesh bhandari refused to invite the bjp to form government though it was the largest party. ''we had no option then but to take help of legislators from other parties. a few of them may have had criminal records. we used them to break the political impasse prevailing at that time,'' he added. ''so far, criminals are not in the bjp. they may be with our allies, '' he said. the former bjp chief was also clear on what action should be taken against indisciplined legislators. ''i do not go by complaints as i know in politics complaints are generally fake,'' he said.

2,SP leader arrested for looting Army cargo,"allahabad: the arrest of samajwadi party leader krishna murari dwivedi alias ''kapuriha'' in a case of looting an army consignment, has sent shock waves in the city, while giving other parties an oppotunity to lambast sp chief mulayam singh yadav for his statements against the criminalisation of politics. kapuriha was being perceived as the party candidate from the bara assembly constituency in the district where he wields considerable influence among upper class voters. the case related to a consignment worth over rs 22 lakh looted near kunda in pratapgarh district. the consignment had been booked by the defence authorities here for delhi and was being transported by xps cargo services. when the truck began its onward journey, the driver was approached by two persons, who identified themselves as drivers of a courier service truck and requested that they be given a lift till kanpur. when the truck reached kunda, the passengers, the driver and the conductor halted at a roadside dhaba to rest for a while and take lunch. here the driver and the conductor were given laddus which the passengers claimed was prasad. the driver and conductor consumed only one laddu and fell unconscious. the truck was found abandoned at shankargarh, while the driver and conductor were left in the cabin with the hands and feet tied up.

3,Parivar in a fix over govt action,"new delhi: the sangh parivar faces a dilemma. its affiliates want a decisive war, limited or full scale, but do not want to upset the us. parivar leaders say either the us gets pakistan to arrest the jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba leadership or let the government bomb terrorist training camps in pok. according to parivar leadership's feedback, the cadre are anxiously awaiting action from the bjp-led government against ''pakistan-sponsored terrorists''. but the parivar does not want to antogonise the us. ''if the government doesn't act, it will affect the credibility of the government and the bjp, and that would certainly have a major negative impact on the rss' credibility,'' said a senior parivar leader. and he added, for now, ''it is advani's tough posturing that has lent a face-saver for all us.'' apparently, the parivar has become a captive of its own rhetoric about hot pursuit and bombing of terrorist training camps across the border. though the bjp has maintained that the government has already acted by recalling the high commissioner to islamabad and that the next step would be taken at an appropriate time, the party also fears its rhetoric about hot pursuit may boomerang in the uttar pradesh polls. for the opposition has borrowed the bjp's slogans and has been claiming that the government has not been effective in tackling terrorism. whether it be former us president bill clinton's claim that he got pakistan to withdraw from kargil, jaswant singh handing over terrorists to the ic 814 hijackers, terror strikes at badamibagh cantonment, j&k assembly or parliament, the government's lack of response is being exploited by the opposition.

5,Octroi dept cracks down on govt contractors,"pune: private parties contracted by the government and the pune municipal corporation (pmc) to carry out various public utility projects across the city learned a basic lesson recently: bagging a government contract does not absolve them from octroi payment. in a major dues recovery drive, the civic octroi department confiscated some 15 road repair vehicles from these contractors in the last week alone. the confiscated vehicles include earth-movers, jcb machines, compressors, paver machines and road rollers. the vehicles were returned after the contractors paid octroi and fines totalling rs 10 lakh in all. speaking to the times of india, octroi department chief rajendra nimbalkar confirmed that the action was directed against the contractors whom he described as ""non-suspecting parties"". he said that a majority of contractors are under the impression that they are exempt from octroi after they have bagged a pmc or government contract. even if the machine is brought in to the city for a temporary period, the contractor is required to pay the octroi and then seek refund after the machine is transported out of the city limits, he added. besides the road contractors, the octroi department squads also swooped down on the pollution under control (puc) units, and to their surprise found that even they had not paid octroi for their machines. five puc machines were confiscated on monday and returned after octroi dues had been recovered.

8,Wanted: Returning officer for MCH polls,"hyderabad: with no ias officer willing to be the returning officer for the city civic elections, municipal corporation of hyderabad (mch) officials are at a loss to find a solution to the problem. with elections fast approaching, the government is finding it difficult to find a suitable officer for the role. earlier, hyderabad district collector rajeshwar tiwari was sounded out, but he refused the offer, saying he had his hands full administering the district. as collector, he has to attend regular meetings with the chief secretary and the chief minister. according to sources, adhar sinha, who was recently appointed the returning officer, is understood to have expressed his displeasure over the appointment. he met mch commissioner p k mohanty and explained his inability to shoulder the responsibility. sinha is understood to have said he would be too busy as special officer, urban land ceiling. one of the reasons why officers are reluctant to take up the assignment is they they are apprehensive about pressure from political parties. given a chance, no officer wants to be the returning officer here. it is not an easy job and that too in the capital city. one just cannot cope up with the duties, a senior ias officer said. several officers also questioned the rationale behind the decision to appoint someone from outside the mch as the returning officer for the poll. they contend that 'outside officers' could only be observers and not the returning officer. since they do not work in the corporation, the personnel would be new to them. earlier, there was a proposal to appoint mch additional commissioners l premchandra reddy,r p sisodia or r karikalvelevan as the returning officer. however, even before the election process started, they were all transferred to different districts as collectors. when adhar sinha was transferred from cuddapah district, mch officials asked the government to post him karikalvelevan's post. at that point of time, his name was proposed as returning officer. but he was posted as special officer of urban land ceiling. he is now understood to have expressed his inability to take up the additional charge. the names of three other ias officers were considered for the post.they are additional commissioner r chandravadan, who heads the secunderabad division of mch, j c sharma, who joined the corporation recently, and additional commissioner (finance) nimje rajendra narendra, who was considered too young and lacking in experience for conducting the election. according to sources, mch commissioner p k mohanty has appraised the state election commission and chief secretary p v rao of the problem on monday.

13,Hard work and sincerity are my strengths: Naidu,"hyderabad: the general impression outside notwithstanding, a new sense of confidence about the future of the telugu desam party and the government has enveloped chief minister n chandrababu naidu. ""the people are with me.they trust me. i have proved my sincerity about developing the state,"" naidu told the times of india in an exclusive interview. during a 30-minute freewheeling interview, naidu shared his thoughts on the recent cabinet expansion, telangana and several other issues. some excerpts: what lessons have you learnt after the local body polls? we got an absolute majority in the assembly constituencies. detailed reviews were carried out by the party and the government to understand the reasons for the result. actually, we had some financial and other problems. weovercame them and did the corrections.today's situation is totally different and the people are with me. your government lacked the propoor face. i introduced reforms to bring about efficiency and generate more revenues for the state. we have provided a safety net for the poor. the reforms will virtually benefit the poor and vulnerable sections of society. the public perception will change. these days you are constantly criticising the congress for ""blocking"" development and progress. from the beginning the congress has been opposing our programmes. i would understand if the communist parties did that because they have an outdated ideology. in fact, the congress government at the centre introduced the reforms. countries like china, malaysia, and south korea advanced only due to reforms. no country has progressed without reforms. the congress has taken a contradictory stand on reforms. they are implementing reforms in states where they are in power and opposing them here. you take the example of hi-tec city, i bulldozed their strong opposition to it. now you can see that it is a monument. their stand on the indian school of business was similar.take the case of kakinada port, which they opposed. now the developers are unable to implement this project at the old price. whatever programmes i take up, they oppose with the sole motive of ensuring that my government does not become popular, and to confuse the people. they are also trying to block power projects. the power purchase agreements were signed during their regime. i reduced the cost in some cases. they know that power is crucial for development but they are trying to block the projects. they know that without power there will be no development. that is their game plan. how do you plan to counter it? hard work, sincerity and commitment are my strengths. people are analysing everything and that is the reason they voted for me. do you think, i am greater than n t rama rao, neelam sanjeeva reddy or brahmananda reddy to get re-elected a second time? the people trusted me and reposed their confidence in me. they say ""here is a person who is doing something for the state"". i will not commit any mistake and i am always trying to improve the living standard of the people. i have established my own credibility in the last six years. i am working with zeal and enthusiasm.whenever i see people, i get satisfaction and inspiration to work more. your ministry-making exercise has triggered dissent in the party. these things happen. such problems do not just apply to me. the bjp government had some problems too and governments elsewhere have faced difficulties. the tdp expands the cabinet once in two years and this time i had a little more discussion on that. knowing how best to make use of available talent is important. it is a dynamic situation. i will never say that those who are in the ministry are efficient and those outside bad. i have strike a balance.

17,SP on damage control mode with eye on polls,"new delhi: battling dissidence on the eve of the crucial uttar pradesh elections, the samajwadi party has got into damage-limitation mode. party general secretaries amar singh and ram gopal yadav joined hands to attack four rebel leaders - former union minister balram singh yadav and three expelled lok sabha members - and dismissed them as bjp ""agents"". yadav said the bjp, panicky over the prospect of losing the up elections had let loose these ""agents"" to cast aspersions on amar singh and the party. monday's exercise was mostly in praise of amar singh, who has been the target of all recent dissidence in the party. both leaders were at pains to decry the rebels for ""biting the hand that fed them"". they accused balram singh yadav of helping the bjp to avoid a cbi inquiry into deals during his tenure as union minister for mines, but ruled out his expulsion. denying that the other rebels had been expelled as they were poised to leave the party anyway, amar singh said sarvaraj singh had been removed two years ago, while ramakant yadav and bhalchandra yadav had to go as the new party profile did not allow for members with such antecedents. ""we decided not to give ticket to anyone with a criminal background, so they were expelled"" he said. they also criticised union minister and janata dal-united leader sharad yadav, accusing him of fomenting trouble in the samajwadi party. making clear that he was not one of those unhappy with amar singh's rising stature in the party, ram gopal yadav said it was personal problems that kept him out of political circulation. singh, he said, was a leader accepted by everyone in the party. the sp dissidents have lashed out at amar singh saying his assets should be probed. ram gopal pointed out that singh was the only mp to have declared all his assets before the chairman of the rajya sabha and lok sabha speaker.

25,JD(S) changes party symbol,"bangalore: former prime minister h.d. deve gowda on tuesday replaced his janata dal (s) party symbol ``farmer driving a tractor'' to a ``woman farm labourer carrying a stack of paddy on her head.'' the election commission has approved the new symbol. according to gowda's supporters the tractor caused confusion among the voters with many of the independent candidates in the elections held so far, going in for a symbol close to it. ``we had to contend with a road-roller, train engine or jeep which look similar to a tractor,'' they added. during the 1999 general elections, gowda opted for the tractor following the dispute with jd(u) over the undivided dal's symbol of a farmer ploughing his land. at the time gowda had said his desire was to see that every farmer owned a tractor. the announcement of the symbol was also done in a dramatic manner. gowda drove the tractor himself from subedar chataram road to his party office on race course road. he drove the tractor violating the one-way traffic rule as he had reportedly been advised by his astrologer not to launch the symbol by heading in a direction towards south. as the one-way was towards south, he drove in the opposite direction. a group of citizens promptly filed a case against him in the high court for violating traffic rules. the new symbol was unveiled by gowda at a simple function at the party office. opposition leader in the legislative council k.h. srinivas said the new symbol would resolve the confusion. ``free symbols similar to the tractor were eating into our votes in the elections,'' he stated.
