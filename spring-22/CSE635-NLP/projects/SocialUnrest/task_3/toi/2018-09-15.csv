5,New BSNL rules set to change mobile phone billing,"ahmedabad: with the bharat sanchar nigam limited issuing notices to cellular operators to enforce ""traffic discipline"" across the country, some mobile phone users in gujarat may suddenly find their bills shooting up. others, of course, stand to benefit under the new regime. effective from september 15, cellular operators in gujarat have been asked to route all out-going calls from the state through the ahmedabad trans-automatic exchange. this implies that a cell user trying to call up a land-line in mumbai from vapi will have to pay std charges for ahmedabad to mumbai. according to an official of fascel limited, the caller who was initially being charged for the airtime and std from the local station, from where the call was been made, will now have to pay from ahmedabad onwards as all out-of-state calls from cell phones in gujarat will be routed through ahmedabad. for long now, the bsnl has been directing all the cellular operator to follow the traffic discipline, the violation of which led to the corporation freezing the allotments of new lines to cellular operators for capacity expansion. the operators had approached that telecom dispute settlement and appellate tribunal which had further put a cap on the release of new lines till the matter was decided. the cellular operators' association of india eventually had to go for an out-of-court settlement as the freeze was affecting their business. while the coai took back the case, the cap was removed and the bsnl released about 180 new point of intersections for land-line and cellular network compatibility in wake of expansion. the condition of the release of new poi to both celforce and birla at&t was, however, that they would adhere to ""traffic discipline"". with all outgoing std calls to land-lines to be charged ex-ahmedabad, some callers will also stand to gain. while person calling mumbai from vapi would have to pay more, a call made from a cellular in palanpur to mumbai will cost less as the std charge will only be applicable from ahmedabad. like ahmedabad in gujarat, the gateway for all states to route outgoing std calls from cellular phones have been determined. for maharashtra (apart from mumbai), the nagpur tax has been set up as the gateway. which also means that a person calling up from a land-line in ahmedabad to a person in pune, will have to bear std charges for ahmedabad to nagpur. similarly a cell-to-cell call between valsad and virar will be charged for a std call between ahmedabad and nagpur in addition to air-time charges, which would be significantly high. the cellular operators so far have been handling outstation calls from the nearest taxs, a practice which the bsnl said was jamming the corporation's network. bsnl said the local taxs had smaller capacity and were unable to handle the load. once the new bsnl terms are enforced, while many may have to pay more, many cell users would also benefit depending on the std band rate structure followed by the bsnl, with respect to gateways and the geopraghic locations of destinations.

7,By election no hurdle to MMCB revival scheme: Central registrar,"gandhinagar: the central registrar of cooperatives has asked the gujarat government to implement the madhavpura mercantile cooperative bank revival scheme, already cleared by the central election commission. but there was lack of clarity in the corridors of power as to if the cheques could be distributed to the mmcb small investors before the bypoll on september 20, crucial for the bjp to get middle-class votes in sabarmati. ""the matter is still pending in the high court"", said a top bureaucrat. ""the government hopes to get it cleared in a couple of days"", he added. a letter dated september 13, sent to chief minister keshubhai patel by the central registrar, stated, ""in the wake of the announcement of byelections in gujarat, the election commission of india called for a report on the rehabilitation package of the mmcb. the commission, however, after considering all the relevant matters, have conveyed no objection to the implementation of the scheme."" it asked the state government to 'take further necessary action in terms of the order dated august 24'. mmcb revival committee's amit shah, a bjp mla, state registrar of cooperatives r.m. joshi and a senior official from the chief minister's office camped in delhi for full day on thursday to get the letter from the central registrar, considered crucial even as a symbolic gesture to gain the confidence of the voters in sabarmati that the mmcb package was being put into effect. in a faxed message to the state registrar dated september 3, the central registrar had halted the implementation of the mmcb package 'till further notice' under the cec's order. it is a mystery what exactly does the mmcb package contain. though the state government has got the cec clearance, it is refusing to make the package public. except for government statements, loaded with political phraseology even while seeking to interpret the package, the package as put out by the the central registrar remains a closely guarded secret, snowballing into speculations that the centre has not given any guarantee under the guarantees act against the rs 800 crore other cooperative banks would put into reviving the mmcb. ""the cooperative banks' 70 per cent amount of the rs 800 crore would be blocked into central government securities at the rate of 7.5 per cent for 10 years, which is not exactly guarantee"", said a senior bureaucrat. ""which means that only 30 per cent of the amount to be put in by the cooperative banks would be available for reviving the mmcb"", he added. but officials claimed, the official work for implementing the mmcb package is already on. ""the rbi in mumbai is already calculating how much would it have to pay to small investors under the investor insurance scheme"", an official said.

10,CERC tells govt to compensate blinding victims,"ahmedabad: consumer education and research centre (cerc), ahmedabad has made a representation to the state government urging it to pay compensation to the 33 victims of eye surgeries conducted at a charitable hospital in the city in july this year. ""the government cannot wash its hands off the tragedy and therefore should compensate the hapless patients who are old and daily wage-earners,"" cerc has stated in a letter to the state health minister suresh mehta. cerc said the victims of the july eye operations have been left to their fate because of the government apathy. they have not only lost their eyesight but also their livelihood, as most of them are daily wage-earners. with the government refusing to compensate the victims, they are condemned to live a miserable life. some of them even do not have any members in the family to look after or guide their movement or help them with their day-to-day needs"". while urging compensation to the victims, cerc focussed attention on the government's medicare policy. it has said that as the government is not providing free eye treatment to the poor at its hospitals, ""these children of lesser god"" turn to charitable trusts, which are performing a welcome job in the existing medicare system in the state. however, the state government, which gives financial assistance to trusts/hospitals conducting eye camps, is yet to establish minimum norms to be fulfilled before the hospitals are granted recognition. ""sometimes these operations are performed in an unacceptable hygienic conditions"", it has stated. cerc avers that the government is ""equally guilty of negligence for not auditing the facilities and satisfying itself of the suitability of those receiving grants"". professional and expert bodies like indian medical association and the indian opthalmological society should play a ""proactive role"", and ensure that their members insisted on minimum hygienic and sterility requirements before undertaking mass eye operations, cerc has stated. ""from these gujarat tragedies, it is clear that the sacred faith reposed by the citizens in the doctors has been betrayed. in their own private clinics, the same doctors go to the extent of maintaining all the necessary facilities like a good autoclave with temperature monitor and a temperature recorder"". no wonder with efficient air-conditioning and well-fumigated operation theatres and filtered air under positive pressure and safe medicines, the success rate of these very operations in these doctors' private hospitals and clinics is almost cent per cent, cerc has stated in the letter.

12,Md Amin to be acting chief minister,"kolkata: the number two man in the buddhadeb bhattacharjee ministry, nirupam sen, will not officiate as the acting chief minister during bhattacharjee's weeklong tour to japan. neither will the number-three man, surya kanta misra, get a chance. instead, the number four man, mohammed amin, will take charge during bhattacharjee's absence. while the politically significant decision was announced by chief secretary manish gupta at writers' buildings on friday with the cpm officially trying to pass it off as routine and non-controversial, the inner core of the party was abuzz, trying to fathom the political consequences. several top cpm leaders, including one state committee member, saw in the decision one more indication that writers' buildings and alimuddin street were not on the same political wave-length. though the choice of amin was unanimous in the state secretariat of the cpm, which met earlier in the day, insiders pointed out that it was a mere formality and the real implications lay elsewhere. nirupam sen should have been the obvious choice as the acting chief minister during buddhada's absence, as he is number two in the cabinet, a state committee member said. at least suryada could have been chosen, he argued. the cpm leader stressed that the dropping of sen and misra, both known to be conservative marxists and close to the alimuddin street bosses, indicated that bhattacharjee was determined to push through his pro-industry agenda much to the chagrin of his more hard-line comrades. sen, the state industry minister, has reportedly failed to appreciate the chief minister's views on the industrial front on several occasions. the choice of the chief minister's companions for his japan trip was also not without any debate, insiders pointed out. amin saheb is one person in the cabinet who nourishes no further ambition to rise either in the party or in the ministry, said a cpm leader with a wink. cpm state secretary anil biswas, however, dismissed all speculation on the issue saying that amin was selected because he was a senior member of the cabinet.

17,Chauhan to take plunge into politics,"chandigarh: after having propagated secessionism for more than 15 years, former khalistan ideologue jagjit singh chauhan has decided to jump into active politics in the state. making a departure from his earlier stance that he had no intentions to delve in the state politics, he proposes to field candidates in the forthcoming vidhan sabha elections and formally launch a new political party. chauhan, who propagated khalistan sitting in the uk for more than a decade, would take the first leap forward in that direction at a public meeting scheduled to be held in tanda town in hoshiarpur district on september 17. this would be his first public interaction on a large scale after returning from the uk in july last. leading legal luminary ram jethmalani and supporters of former prime minister chandra shekhar would be joining chauhan at the public meeting. tanda, being his home turf from where he was elected to the vidhan sabha twice in 1962 and 1967, is likely to provide him initial impetus that he requires to launch himself for his political reincarnation. talking to the times of india, chauhan said he did not intend to form a political party immediately. ""but, yes i would take a jump in politics with an eye on the coming vidhan sabha elections"", he said. for the time being, may be, we would be fielding independent candidates mainly in tanda and its adjoining areas. the intention, he said, is to take on the congress and the shiromani akali dal and provide a healthy alternative to people. asked if his candidates would be ideologically his followers, chauhan said any right thinking person should be ideologically close to him for he would propagate honesty, integrity and moral uprightness only. he said he would launch new political party probably after the elections. he justified forming a new party saying that how else would one achieve the goal and wage fight and struggle against all that unjust one sees happening around. he said his goal was bring about transformation in the political system which is absolutely rotten and retrograde. chauhan started finding his political moorings after he called on large number of leaders including chandra shekhar and rss chief k.sudarshan during his recent visit to new delhi. in new delhi, he had sought to reaffirm his patriotic credentials by identifying himself with a campaign for retrieving mortal remains of prithvi raj chauhan.
