0,"Save us, our chickens, poultry farmers plead","BELLARY: The poultry farmers from Bellary district have urged the Karnataka government to take measures on a war-footing to end their woes as they could not transport chicken feed and eggs because of truckersâ€™ strike, which entered the seventh day on Sunday.

G. Srinivas, secretary, Bellary District Poultry Farmersâ€™ Association, told The Times of India here that the government had remained callous to the woes of poultry farmers despite them sending many representations. â€œThere has absolutely been no help from any government quarter,â€™â€™ he said. Though the poultry farmers have been facing innumerable problems in the last one week, no politician or government representative had lent an audience to them, he added.

About 1.1 lakh birds starved to death as chicken feed could not be transported because of the truckersâ€™ strike, which has nailed in a loss of Rs 77 lakh to the poultry farmers. Also, lakhs of eggs worth lakhs of rupees have been rotting in godowns waiting for transport. The government had withheld subsidies due to the farmers. Besides, he alleged, the government has not been implementing the midday meal scheme for schoolchildren in right earnest, under which an egg has to be given along with meal for every child.

â€œIf this scheme is implemented, then a minimum of 50 lakh eggs will be required. This ensures the farmers benefit in many ways.â€™â€™ In contrast, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu were implementing a similar scheme successfully. Therefore, Srinivas said, the district administration should look into the farmersâ€™ problems and initiate efforts to ensure transport for the poultry farms.

1,Battle of babus begins for top govt post,"BANGALORE: The IAS and IPS lobbies in the state government are pulling all strings to get a man from their clan picked for the coveted transport commissionerâ€™s post. Though the government transferred the present incumbent T. Thimme Gowda, it is yet to find a suitable babu to succeed him due to the tussle between the IAS and IPS lobby.

Since the transport commissioner is also the chairman of the State Transport Authority (STA) â€”a quasi-judicial body â€”the IAS men feel that they are the best bet for this dual post. Only the high court has the powers to review STA chief â€™s verdict on disputes between public and RTO officials.

Can an IPS officer with no magisterial powers be made STA chairman? â€œIf an IPS officer is made transport commissioner, then another IAS man has to be posted as STA head which will be a burden on the exchequer,â€� a senior IAS officer said. However, aspirants among the IPS officers are against the stand taken by their rival lobby. â€œIf IPS officers can be posted to universities in the state and other departments of government, why not to the transport department?â€™â€™ they question.

Amidst this controversy, transport minister Ramanath B. Rai is learnt to have opposed the appointment of IPS officers in his fiefdom. But, the ball is now in chief minister S.M. Krishnaâ€™s court, who is expected to make an announcement in a couple of days.

2,City police arrest three more in boy abduction case,"KOLKATA: Three wanted men â€“ Shafique, Israel and Usman â€“ were arrested by the city police on Sunday for their role in abducting nine-year-old Sohail Ansari from central Kolkata on April 9. With this, the police have nabbed six persons in the kidnap case so far.

Sohail, a class II student of St Anthony School, was kidnapped when he was playing in front of his house at Collin Street. The abduction was a fallout of a family rivalry. He, however, returned home unhurt after eight hours. According to DC (central) Zulfiquar Hasan, Mohammed Shafique, 19, and Mohammed Israel, 28, were arrested from Bowbazar while Mohammed Usman, 19, was arrested from Taltala Lane.

Sohailâ€™s cousin had masterminded the kidnapping. Sohailâ€™s father Afzal Ansari had accused the man of misappropriation of funds. To avenge the insult, he had planned to kidnap Ansariâ€™s son Sohail.

A ransom of Rs 15 lakh was demanded for the boyâ€™s release. As soon as the police was informed of the abduction, three persons, Ajmat, the victimâ€™s uncle, and Raymond and Shabbir, were arrested from central Kolkata. Cornered, the abductors released Sohail within eight hours of his abduction.

Of those arrested, Shafique drove the taxi in which Sohail was abducted while Israel was the man who had hired the taxi. Usman had actually picked up the boy and bundled him into the taxi.

3,Prices of essential commodites go up,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The prices of essential commodities, fruits, vegetables and flowers have steeply increased in Kerala with the truck operators'' strike entering the seventh day on Sunday.

Kerala being a consumer state, most of the essential commodities and vegetable come from neigbouring states and with the truckers stir continuing many of these items have become scarce.

Even though government as part of its effort to control the situation, has lifted restrictions in transporting essential commodities from the neighbouring states in private and public sector vehicles, there was no marked improvement in the supply position.

Civil Supplies corporation and Horticulture department have initiated steps to procure materials by hiring vehicles from available sources to distribute through its outlets.

However, supply of diesel and petrol have not been affected so far.

4,'Closer industry-govt ties must to boost investment',"AHMEDABAD: Calling for a closer industry-government interaction to boost investment in Gujarat, state industry and mines minister Anil Patel has urged the industry to play an active role in developing key sectors like agriculture, healthcare, biotechnology, education and tourism.

""Both the industry and the government have important roles to play to give Gujarat a stable economic background and present it as a model state. Entrepreneurship has been the backbone of Gujarat and the government is trying to put back the feel-good factor in the Gujarat economy"", the minister said during an interaction with industry captains of the state here on Saturday. The meet was organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

Seeking active involvement of the industry in showcasing the state as an investment-friendly destination, Patel said that CII could make suggestions to the government on creating a conducive atmosphere to attract investments in biotechnology, especially in the biotechnology park in Vadodara, and pharmaceuticals.

""CII can also work closely with us in developing specific tourism projects and organise road shows to showcase Gujarat as an attractive destination"", he said.

According to Patel, the industry could partner the government in agri-invest opportunities, including rural employment and wasteland development, as well as provide key inputs on strengthening the small and medium enterprise (SME) clusters and make them more competitive.

""The government will soon be meeting SIDBI to discuss the viability of providing loans to SMEs at a lower cost"", he said. The minister pointed out that the government was taking steps to encourage private participation in developing wastelands on a lease basis and infrastructure projects like water pipelines, improving the service sector through emphasis on education and attracting private participation, especially from NRIs, in healthcare.

Speaking on the textile sector, Patel informed the gathering that plans for apparel parks in Surat and Ahmedabad were being given a fast-track treatment with the first park expected to become operational within a year. Similar parks for gems and jewellery were also on the cards in these two cities.

CII (Gujarat Council) chairman Piruz Khambatta said, ""CII wants to showcase the entrepreneurial skills of the state and has decided upon ''Competitiveness-fast forward to being number 1'' as the theme for the Gujarat Council this year"".

5,Experts question govt's plan to set up tech university,"AHMEDABAD: Even as they rue the deteriorating standard of technical education and research in the state, experts in the field are watching the state government''s proposal to set up a technical university warily.

Experts question the logic behind establishing such a university on a variety of counts. ""We are not averse to working with the government on any of its initiative, which seeks to elevate the standard of technical education. However, we are not convinced of the logic behind setting up a technical university that would be just an affiliating kind with no teaching arm"", said chairman of Society for Promotion of Technical Education and Research (Sopter), R N Vakil.

Further, there should be a postgraduate research component to such a university, said N R Dave, former vice-chancellor of North Gujarat University. ""Otherwise, there would not be any qualitative input of a technical university"", he added.

But minister of state for higher and technical education Anandi Patel rules out such a possibility. ""We certainly intend to set up a full-fledged university that concentrates simply on technical education. However, to begin with, it would be the affiliating kind where all the technical institutes in the state would have to de-affiliate from their present universities and be affiliated to the new technical university"", she said.

The minister also said that Rs 5 lakh has been allotted in the budget for the project. ""After a feasibility report is prepared by the expert committee, we will pump in more funds"", she said.

The proposal to set up a technical university in Gujarat to enhance the standard of technical education in the state was mooted last year by the ministry of higher and technical education. ""The idea is to standardise technical education. Students passing from any of the colleges, would get the same degree. This means they would not be discriminated against when they enter the job market"", said secretary higher and technical education R K Tripathi.

""So what if this breeds mediocrity?"" experts counter. As former chairman of technical examination board J R Dave argued, ""An affiliating model is an old concept and countries around the world have done away with it as institutes would have to run for everything, such as updating the curriculum, to the university. Instead, all universities should act as centres of excellence such as the IITs"", he said.

Incidentally, Sopter presented a paper to the government in 1997 on ''Status of Technical Education in Gujarat and Blue Print in the Next Decade''. It recommended setting-up of a Gujarat State Council headed by experts to support technical education in the state and to monitor the quality of technical education and research.

""Presently, all our technical institutes concentrate on undergraduate courses. There is an acute need for research and upgradation of technical education. A new university should know what its priorities are"", said executive chairman of Nirma Education Foundation N V Vasani.

Also, the affiliating model that was adopted from Britain, has been already done away with there, so why do we continue to carry the baggage, said Vakil.

6,"Doctors' dilemma, PMSA elections notwithstanding","LUCKNOW: While a nail-biting contest is in the offing for the Provincial Medical Services Association (PMSA) elections to be held on April 30 in all the district headquarters, doctors face a peculiar situation. No doctor in the services has been promoted for the past 30 years, even though the Supreme Court had directed the state government to do so within three months.

Giving this information, emergency medical officer of Balrampur hospital, Dr MN Siddiqui, who is also the state election officer of the PMSA, said that the SC had in its decision on December 4, 2002, directed the state government to give due promotions to doctors according to seniority within six weeks, which was extended to three months after the state government expressed its inability to comply with the directions. After the government faltered in the March 31 deadline, the SC, after issuing a contempt notice, granted a two-week time to the state government.

Even that period, said Siddiqui, had lapsed on April 14. The government has been given time till April 21 by the SC. Sources said that while all retired employees would get due benefits, the government was still unprepared to satisfy the working employees. Meanwhile, the elections will be held for the posts of president, vice- president, vice-president (woman), vice-president (general), general secretary, additional general secretary, finance secretary and editor.

Around 9,000 candidates will participate in the elections for which Dr DP Misra, and Dr RB Agarwal, both from Lucknow, are the contestants for the presidentâ€™s post. Dr BP Bajpai, Dr BD Awasthi, Dr RN Puri and Dr Shyam Murari Kalra, all from Lucknow, are the contestants for the vice-presidentâ€™s post. Dr Nirupama Singh and Dr Sushma Singh, both from Lucknow, will contest for the post of vice-president (woman). Dr Arun Kumar from Allahabad, Dr KN Patni from Etah, Dr LK Sahu from Jhansi, Dr OP Singh from Gorakhpur, Dr Suresh Chandra from Bareilly and Dr SP Pal from Varanasi will contest for the post of vice-president (general). Dr AK Shukla, Dr DR Singh and Dr RB Singh, all from Lucknow, will contest for the post of general secretary.

Dr BS Chaudhari from Meerut and Dr SK Misra from Lucknow will contest for the post of additional general secretary. Dr JP Bajpai from Kanpur nagar, Dr RP Pandey from Lucknow and Dr RC Sharma from Bara Banki will contest for the post of finance secretary. Dr KK Tyagi from Meerut, however, is the only candidate for the post of editor. An election officer and a returning officer will ensure that the elections are conducted in a fair manner.

7,Family suicide pact: 1 dies,"HYDERABAD: In a suicide pact, a 40-year old man injected himself and his wife with overdoses of anaesthetics and administered sleeping pills to his four children at his rented house in Ramnagar on Saturday night.

The man, M P Suresh Nair, died after being admitted to Gandhi Hospital while his 33-year old wife Saralaâ€™s condition is stated to be out of danger. The children â€” Akhil, 6; Arun, 2; Aditi, 5 and Arati, 3, vomited in the morning and soon returned to normalcy. The incident came to light on Sunday morning when the children informed the neighbours that their parents were not responding to their wake-up call. The neighbours informed the police who rushed Nairâ€™s family to Gandhi Hospital.

The children are being looked after by some constables and the landlord whose house Nair had rented. Nair, a native of Kerala, was living with his two wives â€” Sarala and Vislam, and four children in New Delhi where Vislam worked as a staff nurse at a hospital, Chikkadpally assistant commissioner of police M Ramesh Babu said. The entire family lived on Vislamâ€™s earnings and the latter was finding it difficult to make both ends meet. The financial burden allegedly forced Vislam to commit suicide on March 13 in New Delhi. A frustrated Nair, who had no alternative means of livelihood came down to Hyderabad on March 16 and took a house on rent from the landlord Krishna at Ramnagar. Since then, he had been trying to get a job.

His second wifeâ€™s death and financial problems appear to have forced him to take the extreme step, the ACP said, and added that the New Delhi police and Nairâ€™s relatives have been informed about the incident. In a suicide note, Nair claimed that financial problems drove them to take the extreme step.

8,"Strike off, says govt; truckers cry foul","HYDERABAD: The indefinite strike of truckers entered the seventh day in the state on Sunday amidst claims by the government that the truckersâ€™ unions had called off the strike.

Even as transport minister M Damodar Reddy and transport commissioner A Giridhar held a press conference in the afternoon to announce that the truckers have called off the strike, the Andhra Pradesh Lorry Owners Association, the umbrella organisation of truckers in the state, vehemently denied the government claim and threatened to intensify the agitation. Damodar Reddy and Giridhar, along with members of the AP Transport Joint Action Committee (JAC), announced at the Secretariat that the truckers had called off the strike.

The minister said the JAC had agreed to end the strike based on an assurance given by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday morning when the former met him at his residence. JAC convener Iqbal Hussain said the government had agreed to the demands of the truck operators.

However, AP Lorry Owners Association president P Gopal Naidu, addressing a press conference later, accused the government of misleading the people by resorting to a disinformation campaign. Dismissing the JAC as a â€˜letter head organisationâ€™, he said the government would really know who was in control of the situation once the exemption given to transportation of essential goods ends on April 21.

9,"Improve quality of coal, says minister","DHANBAD: â€œCoal industry has miserably failed to play an effective role in social and economic development of the country.â€� Making this observation, Union minister for coal Karia Munda called upon the scientists and technocrats to strive hard and make the country self-sufficient in the field of energy.

He was addressing the inaugural function of a two-day national seminar on â€œCoal Science and Technology-Vision 2020â€� organised by the Central Fuel Research Institute (CFRI) at the institute auditorium here on Sunday.

It is a challenge before the scientist community to improve the quality of indigenous coal, making its utilisation more scientific and eco-friendly, he said adding that the technocrats should try to reduce the ash content of the coal and increase its calorific value and heating quality, right at the time of its mining.

The demand of imported coal has increased because of its better quality and low cost, but still majority of the imported coal are being utilised in blending with indigenous coal to improve its calorific value, he opined.

He also exhorted the scientists to improve the quality of indigenous coal so as to produce it as an alternative to the imported coal before the industry depending on imported coal.

The coal minister also stressed on improvement in work culture in the industry. One should always try to take the country and society ahead on the path of development, he added. Addressing the function chairman of Coal India Ltd. (CIL) said that technology for washing coal has not been given its due importance in the country and the usefulness of the washed coal is not coming forth.

Praising the efforts of the CFRI scientists in the field of coal benefication and coal liquification Sharma said that with improvement in these technologies not only the low quality coal found in Assam could be made use of, but the questions being raised by the power sector on use of coal can also be answered.

In his welcome address CFRI director Kalyan Sen said that in view of the stringent environmental regulations, coal is required to answer the environmental concerns surrounding its use through development and introduction of cleaner coal technology. Dr R Natrajan, chairman of the CFRI Research Council and Dr AK Singh, secretary of the seminar organising committee also addressed the function. Deputy director Dr PK Bandopadhyay presented the vote of thanks.

Munda also inaugurated a fine coal treatment plant on the institute premises on the occasion.

Talking to media persons, Munda said that the Central government has sought help from the state government to provide land for digging trench along the mines affected by underground fire and rehabilitation of the persons to be displaced from the fire zone. But so far the Jharkhand government has not been able to provide the required land. Replying to a question the minister said that it was not possible for CCL or ECL alone to stop pilferage of coal without active help from the administration.

12,Staff to protest return of Mukul Joshi,"CHANDIGARH: Even as financial commissioner Mukul Joshi is firmly saddled as principal secretary, industries and commerce, after being exonerated by chief minister Amarinder Singh in the controversial Panchkula episode, employees of the Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation (PSIDC), the Punjab State Small Scale Industrial Exports Corporation (PSSSIE) and the Punjab Financial Corporation (PFC) have raised a banner of revolt against him.

The employees of the three corporation have formed a joint action committee and have decided to organise protest meetings against the posting of Joshi from April 24. Convener of the action committee G S Oberoi said the reappointment of Joshi in the industries department, who was involved in an act of moral turpitude, clearly indicated that the Amarinder governmentâ€™s campaign against corruption was a political weapon targeted to harass political opponents.

He said the employees had earlier brought various administrative and financial irregularities committed by Joshi in the industries department during his earlier tenure to the notice of the governor and the chief minister, yet no action had been taken against him.

Joshi, he said, caused financial losses running into crores of rupees. While demanding Joshiâ€™s removal from the office, Oberoi said the action committee would intensify agitation against the officer if the government did not pay heed to its demands.

13,"VB smelt a rat, govt gives clean chit","CHANDIGARH: The Vigilance Bureau inquiries are not always comfortable for the government and can be overturned if they rub the government on the wrong side as had been in the case of purchase of Korean rice mills.

Even as the Vigilance Bureau, after a month-long investigation, had smelt a rat in the Rs 15-crore deal struck by the Markfed to purchase the Korean mills during the SAD-BJP rule, the state government has overruled the inquiry and has brushed aside the case seeing no foul play in it. The Vigilance Bureau was half way through with its investigations in the matter when chief secretary Y S Ratra intervened to call for the case file suggesting that he would get the matter probed on his own.

Sources said the government put the Vigilance Bureau on the hold after it started questioning the role of the then Markfed managing director D S Bains, IAS, who was allegedly responsible for placing the order for the rice mills which were not required at all. The Markfed had placed an order for purchasing six Korean rice mills at the cost of Rs 2.50 crore each on the ground that each unit had the capacity to produce 80 per cent grain as against the indigenous rice mills which would operate on the alleged 40 per cent capacity. However, when the Korean mills arrived, it delivered a far from satisfactory performance.

Moreover, while according to the department plan just one piece was proposed to be purchased for trial purposes, the Markfed ended up buying six pieces. All the units had since been lying unused causing a loss to the Markfed. The Vigilance Bureau had called for the record in the case and had started looking into the role of officials, including the then managing director, for executing a redundant deal. However, as the names of officials, including an IAS officer, started figuring in the investigation, the chief secretary asked for the case file and entrusted the inquiry to principal secretary, food and supplies, B R Bajaj.

Bajaj, in his report submitted to the chief secretary last week, absolved Bains and other officials in the case and observed that the order was placed collectively by the board of directors of the Markfed so Bains could not be solely held responsible for the â€˜â€˜misplacedâ€™â€™ deal. He concluded that there was â€˜â€˜no hankypankyâ€™â€™ involved in the deal.
