0,Panel boundaries for PMC elections announced,"pune: the pune municipal corporation election office on saturday went ahead with its scheduled programme and announced the boundaries of the 48 panels which will go to the polls on february 10. this is despite efforts by the ruling congress party to scrap this process. the congress is hell-bent on scrapping the current election process as the elections for 146 wards, clubbed under 48 panels, includes the 15 fringe villages which have been delinked from the pmc fully and the five villages which have been delinked partially. a cabinet minister even summoned municipal commissioner t c benjamin to mumbai on saturday morning and there were rumours that the programme of announcing the boundaries of the 48 panels would not be held, or if held, would be scrapped by the evening. it may be noted here that even if the current election process is scrapped, it will only mean that the geographical boundaries of the areas comprising a panel would change. the panel system as such will not be scrapped. the pmc elections will be held as per the panel system instead of the ward system (see story below). though the commissioner could not be contacted till late evening, the pmc's election officer, rajendra nimbalkar, asserted that he has not received any order for scrapping the present election process. ""as of now, the panel demarcations done by us today are valid,"" he said. his office will however have to start the process afresh if the state government and the state election commission orders it to do so, he admitted. this could lead to postponement of the pmc elections as the laborious process of demarcating the municipal panels would have to be reworked if the 20 villages are excluded from the election process. the congress wants the present process be scrapped because they argue that there is no point in conducting the elections and getting corporators elected from areas which will not be in the pmc's jurisdiction (when the villages are delinked). meanwhile, mr nimbalkar has announced that the suggestions and objections to the panel demarcations announced by the pmc on saturday will be accepted till november 27. after hearing the objections on november 29 and december 1, the pmc will finalise the boundaries on december 7. the real election tussle will begin from january 4, from the day of filing the nominations till the day of polling, which is february 10. according to tentative estimates, the municipal elections will cost around rs 7 crore.

1,Equipment tenders floated to favour private firm,"hyderabad: tenders for outsourcing diagnostic equipment for various district hospitals in the state were called with an apparent prior intention to favour a particular company. the andhra pradesh health and medical housing and infrastructure development corporation issued the tender notification following a proposal submitted by the company. documents in the possession of the times of india reveal that the tender notification was a mere formality as the company, wipro ge medical systems pvt. ltd, had already made a presentation to the state government proposing to set up certain diagnostic equipment in district hospitals. the tender process, the notification for which was issued on oct. 9, 2001, has now ran into rough weather with competing companies objecting that the conditions set by the corporation were impractical. one of them was that the companies that supply the equipment would have to charge rates that are half of those charged at the nizam's institute of medical sciences (nims). another was that the equipment would become property of the respective hospital after three years. with the tender process kicking up a controversy, the corporation has extended the last date, from nov. 17 to dec. 3. that the tenders were floated with wipro ge private limited in mind is apparent from a letter written by dr k anji reddy, commissioner of the a p vaidya vidhana parishad to c arjun rao, special chief secretary in the health, medical and family welfare department. in the letter (d.o. rc. no. 4268/plg/2001 dated 12-07-2001), anji reddy says: if wipro ge private limited gives us the proposals as per our guidelines and if they are acceptable for the 3-tier charging system, we can accept their proposals for implementation in the district hospitals. anji reddy also says in the letter that four district hospitals in mahbubnagar, nellore, eluru and karimnagar had already been finalised for ct scan and colour doppler'' and the remaining hospitals could be considered for public (sic) private participation through wipro ge private limited.'' these are srikakulam, vizianagaram, rajahmundry, tenali, ongole, cuddapah, adilabad, sangareddy, nalgonda,khammam,nizamabad and chittoor. when contacted, a spokesman of wipro ge medical systems ltd in bangalore said: it is normal for wipro ge medical systems to make presentations to potential customers, which includes governments, on how we can bring value to their mission.we trust the judgement of the customer to make a considered decision.

2,Naidu for safeguards on terror law,"new delhi:chief ministers participating in the conference on internal security here were clearly divided on partisan lines â€” major congress-ruled states opposing poto and the bjp cms pitching it. tamil nadu's o paneerselvam and andhra pradesh's chandrababu naidu were the only surprises with paneerselvam completely backing poto and naidu calling for safeguards against its misuse. naidu defended poto, saying, there is no gainsaying the fact that extraordinary situations require extraordinary solutions''. he, however, said adequate safeguards should be taken up to eliminate the scope for abuse of extraordinary powers vested in law enforcement agencies''. he particularly wanted suitable modifications to the provision of section 3 (8) and section 14 of the ordinance, to protect the freedom of press which is the hallmark of parliamentary democracy''. he also suggested that the validity of the 'sunset legislation' be reduced from five to three years. backing poto, paneerselvam said, we find that most of the provisions in poto are milder than those in tada''. pointing out that tamil nadu had suffered terrorism for years, he said even now some terrorist groups, though under check, have the potential to resurface and indulge in subversive activities. maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh stressed that poto has been brought by way of an ordinance without any elaborate consultations. kerala cm a k antony and his west bengal counterpart buddhadeb bhattacharya rejected poto, repudiating the promulgation of the ordinance as anti-people. this legislation is anti-democratic, suffers from serious legal infirmities and is liable to abuse,'' antony said in his speech. bhattacharjee, whose poto-like draft law was shot down by his own party, said in view of the misuse of tada in the past it would be wiser to leave it to the states to decide whether there was any need for such a central law. gujarat cm narendra modi, calling for poto like law, said since tada lapsed there has been a spurt in terrorist activities. it is now a battle between unequals, with the criminals having the upper hand,'' modi said. madhya pradesh cm digvijay singh rejected poto, stating that instead of enacting a special legislation, provisions in the criminal procedure code, the indian penal code and the evidence act could be suitably amended to combat terrorism. he said there was no urgency for the ordinance. bjp chief ministers were, predictably, strongly supportive of poto. up's rajnath singh said poto could be an effective weapon to combat and control terrorist activities. if we take action under this act, we can achieve results, he said.pointing to the problem of infiltration across the indo-nepal border, he said there was an urgent need to keep constant vigil.

3,Terror law to be watered down?,"new delhi: the centre was on saturday forced to agree to an all-party meeting on poto before the legislation is introduced in parliament after its efforts to forge a consensus on the controversial ordinance failed at the chief ministers' conference on internal security. barring the bjp-ruled states, the centre's attempt to form a federal investigating agency was also opposed. the only consensus was on the need for an appropriate legislation to fight terrorism, but its shape and form eluded the day-long meeting. finally, home minister advani, who is piloting the legislation and been taking a strong line on opposition to it, was compelled to use more conciliatory language and say the centre was open to suggestions. at the recent bjp national executive in amritsar, and at the social editors' conference advani said, ''those who oppose poto are appeasing terrorists'' and ''we are in a win-win situation; either the bill gets passed and if it does not, those who oppose it will be in the dock.'' but on saturday, asked to comment on the anti-poto state governments, advani said he didn't wish to as the centre was still trying to work out a ''consensus'', which the prime minister said he hoped for on internal security issues. if consensus fails to emerge at the all-party meeting too, the bjp-led government will have to consider whether to risk poto being defeated in the rajya sabha, and assess if that will be taken as a defeat for the government or whether it can be used to separate the ''nationalists'' from the ''anti-national forces''. nda's strong ally chandrababu naidu called for ''poto with safeguards''. om prakash chautala, an nda partner, however, lashed out at the centre for trying to create a federal investigative agency which, he said, was an encroachment on the states' powers. a clear message that emerged from saturday's meeting was that while the bjp-led government feels the need for central legislation and a centralised mechanism to deal with terrorism, the states for the greater part feel that they can cope with it on their own.

5,Rising sons brighten state's political horizon,"mumbai: maharashtra has become a land of rising sons. recently, when congress president sonia gandhi inaugurated a rs 42-crore cooperative sugar factory in latur promoted by amit deshmukh, son of chief minister vilasrao deshmukh, in the presence of thousands of farmers, she also, in a way, launched his political career. most politicians in maharashtra, including mr deshmukh, have made their way up the political ladder by way of the cooperative sector, and it is not surprising that the younger deshmukh has chosen to do likewise. since thousands of farmers are dependent on these sugar factories for the purchase of their cane, politicians controlling cooperative sugar factories get ready access to huge vote-banks. incidentally, deshmukh senior's manjra cooperative sugar factory in latur is only 10 km away from that of his son's. another rising son is ranjeet mohite-patil whose father, vijaysinh mohite-patil, minister for public works, has inherited the political legacy of his sugar baron-father shankarrao mohite-patil. the mohite-patils control a slew of cooperative institutions in solapur. mr vijaysinh mohite-patil has for long nursed chief ministerial ambitions, but has failed to see his dream materialise. he is now promoting ranjeet who, political observers say, is showing a great deal of promise. ranjeet studied in the english-medium greenfingers school set up by his father at akluj in solapur district and later got a degree in the arts from k.c. college, mumbai. he currently heads the youth wing of the ncp and, in this capacity, has been extensively touring the state, studying local problems and establishing political contacts. the late congress leader jawaharlal darda's two sons - vijay and rajendra - have already arrived on the political scene and carved out a niche for themselves. while vijay is a rajya sabha member, rajendra is the minister of state for energy. former minister abhaysinharaje bhosale's son shivendra is already a full-time politician. both father and son, descendants of chhatrapati shivaji, were in the ncp until recently. shivendra has since moved into the congress camp. his father is expected to follow suit. senior congress leader s.b. chavan has similarly been assiduously promoting his son ashok chavan for the past several years. mr ashok chavan has been a member of several state ministries and currently handles the important revenue portfolio. the senior chavan was hoping that sonia gandhi would handpick ashok for the chief ministership after the last assembly elections, but leaders like madhavrao scindia had backed vilasrao deshmukh for the job. however, ashok chavan remains hopeful because of his vast administrative experience and his father's clout in the higher echelons of the congress. the state's political heavyweights are grooming relatives other than just sons to take on the reins of power. nationalist congress party president sharad pawar has only one daughter, supriya, who has so far displayed no inclination towards politics even though there are indications that she might take the plunge. but for the past several years, mr pawar has been nursing his nephew ajit, who is now a cabinet minister in charge of the irrigation portfolio. in fact, it was mr sharad pawar's decision to promote ajit which compelled his close associate suresh kalmadi to revolt against him. a low-profile politician, mr ajit pawar enjoys enormous political clout in the ncp and is generally looked upon as his uncle's political heir-apparent. he has a dominant presence in the world of cooperative banks and has created a political base for himself in baramati and pune. former chief minister a.r. antulay, who is now head of the minority cell of the all-india congress committee, has smoothly inducted his son-in-law mushtaq antulay into politics. the softspoken mushtaq is a member of the upper house and now heads the important maharashtra pollution control board. deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal's son pankaj and nephew sameer are actively involved in politics and are trying to carve out a space for themselves. they have been organising meetings of the samata parishad set up by mr bhujbal to galvanise obc support across the state. balasaheb thorat, a young legislator from sangamner in ahmednagar district, is another rising star in western maharashtra. he has taken over the mantle of his father, former mla bhausaheb thorat, and is today a minister of state in the vilasrao deshmukh cabinet. rajesh tope is another upcoming politician from marathawada. he has been successfully groomed by his father ankush tope, who headed the all-powerful maharashtra federation of cooperative sugar factories and has represented the jalna lok sabha constituency.

7,Afghan refugee influx: UN urges national law,"new delhi: afghan refugees are trickling into india following us bombings of their country even as the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) has asked the government to consider a national law on refugees. there has been a trickle of afghan refugees of indian origin here following the us bombing over afghanistan, wei meng lim kabaa, deputy chief of mission of un high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) here, said. while only 35 individuals, mainly sikh and hindus, have applied to unhcr for the status of refugee, according to khalsa diwan welfare society (kdws), a network support group for refugees, nearly 100 afghan refugees have come here with about 500 more waiting to do so in various parts of pakistan. agreeing that there were many more refugees coming to india as compared to those who have applied for the refugee status at present, kabaa said the mission has sent a proposal to the government regarding a national law on refugees. india was not a signatory to the un convention on refugees, she said, but ""we have sent a proposal to home, external affiars and law ministries to consider a national law on refugees in a bid to provide for equal facilities to refugees from all the countries"".

8,Doha declaration victory for Indian farmers: Ajit Singh,"new delhi: hailing wto's doha declaration as a victory for indian farm sector, agriculture minister ajit singh on sunday said the commitment to phase out export subsidy on farm products by developed nations would boost agri-exports from the country. ""all fears about harm to farmers' interests have been proved unfounded. india made major gains at doha meet as the declaration conceded the demand to phase out subsidies for farm items despite eu's resistance"", he said. singh said that though the european union (eu) had its way with the declaration not committing itself to a time-frame for such a phase-out, the issue can be sorted out through further negotiations. ""the willingness to do away with export subsidies and domestic support by developed nations, which happens to be extraordinarily high for developing countries like india to match, is a positive development"", he said. reaffirming the government's commitment to protect the interests of farmers under the wto framework, the minister said the indian team ""managed to stave off problematic areas and negative aspects of the multilateral trade regime at the just concluded ministerial meet"". stating that india emerged as a major player in wto, he said india also wanted additional flexibility to developing countries for providing food security which has been conceded. as demanded by india, the doha declaration also agreed to make market access, domestic support and export competition an integral part of negotiation. india wanted special and differential treatment to developing countries in these three areas of agriculture.

10,PM convenes all-party meet on terror law,"new delhi: prime minister atal bihari vajpayee has convened a meeting of all political parties on november 20 in a bid to evolve a consensus on the controversial anti-terrorism ordinance which was being opposed by congress and left chief ministers. the meeting is being held a day after the commencement of the winter session of parliament. congress holds the key to the passage of the bill replacing the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) in rajya sabha where the ruling nda does not enjoy a majority. a conference of chief ministers on national security had on saturday failed to arrive at a consensus on the ordinance and the prime minister then said he would hold interactions with political parties on the issue. the conference had, however, agreed on the need for a special law to combat terrorism. the conference had witnessed strident criticism by opposition chief ministers who felt that some of the provisions of prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) were ""too harsh"" and could be misused. they were also unhappy that states were not consulted on the measure. congress has already declared that it would oppose the poto tooth and nail as it was a 'draconian' measure. home minister l k advani had on saturday expressed government's readiness to discuss the issue with the opposition parties and said, ""we are willing to accept any suggestions which would make more effective our battle against terrorism.""

11,J&K govt to implement Resettlement Act,"new delhi: after 19 long years, the jammu and kashmir government will now be working out nitty-gritty of implementing the resettlement act after the supreme court declined to give any comments on it. the act provides for return of subjects of jammu and kashmir who have gone away to pakistan occupied kashmir or other parts of pakistan. ""the lordships at the apex court have said they have no comments to offer on the act which justifies our stand that the bill is in order and within the ambit of country's constitution,"" was an interpretation of state assembly speaker abdul ahad vakil. the five-judge constitution bench of the supreme court headed by chief justice s p bharucha said the bill cannot be struck down as it had already become an act. the act, which was introduced during the regime of former chief minister sheikh mohammed abdullah and came into effect on october 6, 1982, was termed by then opposition parties as ""notorious bill number nine"". vakil said kashmir was recognised in indian constitution as it was on august 15, 1947. ""if any of our citizens, who were forced to flee the valley to areas under illegal occupation of pakistan or to other parts of pakistan, during the war, want to come back, there should not be any problem,"" contends vakil. however, he indicated that this law will be applicable to only those who are valid state subjects. asked if the act could lead to a turmoil and face wrath of political parties, vakil said the act was constitutionally valid and there was nothing for the opposition parties to criticise it.

17,`Bihar's communication revolution pegged in govt's help',"patna: by extending fast its optical fibre (of) network and its advanced technology the wireless in local loop (wll), the bharat sanchar nigam limited (bsnl) is on the threshold of bringing about a communication revolution in rural bihar. the aim is to provide telephones in all villages in the current financial year ending march 31, 2002. for this, 186 base transmission stations (bts) are in pipeline with a capacity of 93,000 telephone lines to cover state's all villages. of the 45,077 villages, more than 18,000 have village panchayat telephones (vpts). around 2,000 villages also have telecommunication link and a large number of them are connected to the wll. remaining 26,000 villages would be linked to the wll telecomunciation network through the btss by march 31 next year, said bsnl chief general manager (cgm) here bhagirath prasad. while each bts has 500-telephone line capacity, it will cover villages falling in the 25 km radius. with the btss facility, the bsnl would be able to provide more than one telephone on the wll link to every village, he added. ""but cooperation of the state government is a must. it must provide land for the infrastructure, also at least four-hour power supply in rural areas. it is necessary to charge batteries for 24-hour functioning of the wll system,"" he said. minister of state for communications tapan sikdar, during his recent visit to patna, met chief minister rabri devi and sought land at 110 places in the state for creating telecommunication network. he also urged the cm to ensure at least four-hour power supply to keep the rural telecommunications network functioning for 24 hours every day. the present power supply scenario in rural area, however, is poor. if the four-hour power supply is not ensured then bihar would lag behind other states in rural telecommunications, prasad added. the bsnl would be laying the of cable in the current financial year along 7,000 km route to do networking of all telephone exchanges and the btss for effective telecommunication and to strengthen rural telephony to the optimum level in bihar, he said. at present, majority of the vpts are provided with the multi-access rural radio (marr), which is costly and has become obsolete. in its place, the wll is taking over and, according to the need, the marrs are being replaced by wll equipment. in the past, it was ""phones for the places"". with the wll, mobile communications is replacing telecommunications and the new slogan could be ""phones for people, not for places"", even in rural bihar, a bsnl official said. ""the bsnl is doing all this at a huge cost to fulfil its social obligation regarding providing rural telecomunications. the return, at this stage, is not good,"" prasad said, adding that most of private phone providers in the country have been shying away from this obligation, while no private phone provider is contributing to rural telephony in bihar.

""the lull which we are witnessing for the last few months may last only for a few more months"", mahajan said while speaking at the inauguration of the first-ever ice (information, communication and entertainment) summit here. the uncertainties being faced after the terrorist strikes in the united states would ultimately throw up a number of opportunities for indian ice industry, he said but asked the home industry to reduce its dependence on the us economy. mahajan said it export could not not grow at the anticipated rate of 40 to 45 per cent because of the general downslide in the global economy following the september-11 terrorist strikes in the us. stating that there might be an export drop of 10 to 15 per cent in the current year, he said ""it is a temporary halt and not a long one. i am sure when american economy will pick up and the outsourcing increase, we will go back to the same growth rate."" while promising all possible support from the government for the it industry, mahajan, however, said the private sector was not concentrating on social obligations. ""we are ready to give you a fair regime but social obligation must be shared between the public and private sectors"", the minister said. referring to the convergence bill, he said the government would finalise the bill after having the recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee and also reaching a consensus among the parties concerned, mahajan said on sunday. the minister assured that the government would ensure smooth transition from the present situation once the bill was enacted as a law. earlier inaugurating a software technology park in the city, mahajan stressed the need for making it education a compulsory subject at the school level to prepare the country's youth for the digital age. ""a time will come when there will be a digital divide between those with it education and those without. to bridge this gap, the first thing needed is digital literacy. it, therefore, should be made a compulsory subject of school education just as languages are,"" he said.

20,Union Govt defends juvenile justice law,"new delhi: the union ministry of social justice has justified the re-enactment of the juvenile justice law, saying it has been done to bring it in conformity with the un convention on the rights of the child. ''the main deficiency in the old juvenile justice act of 1986 was that it did not provide for differential approach to children in conflict with law and those in need of care and protection,'' the ministry said in its reply to a petition challenging the provisions of the new law in the delhi high court. the juvenile justice (care and protection of children) act, 2000, has been challenged by former delhi juvenile welfare board chairman b s gahlaut on the grounds that it gives the police the power to send missing children to the welfare homes, including those run by private organisations, without producing them before the boeard or searching for their parents. in such a situation there is every likelihood of the provisions of the act being exploited by certain unscrupulous organisations.
