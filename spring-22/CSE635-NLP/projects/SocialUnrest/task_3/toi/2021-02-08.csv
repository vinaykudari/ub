0,All Cong govts sold out on state's interests: Badal,"GHUMAN (GURDASPUR): Charging the Amarinder government of taking a defeatist stance on the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal, former chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal said on Sunday that all Congress governments had played into the hands of the Centre.

""When I was in jail during Emergency, Indira Gandhi hatched this conspiracy of water sharing with the neighbouring state, later then chief minister Darbara Singh buckled down under pressure, and the construction of SYL was launched,"" he added.

Addressing a massive rally of Shiromani Akali Dal here at the native place of SAD general secretary Dr Daljit Singh, Badal said since Sonia Gandhi was inexperienced, and nowhere near Atal Behari Vajpayee vis-a-vis experience, the Congress-led alliance does not stand any chance of winning the Lok Sabha elections.

Listing the re-establishing of trade and cultural ties with Pakistan due to astute skills of statesmanship of Prime Minister Vajpayee, Badal said Punjab would be the biggest beneficiary.

He blamed the policies of successive Congress prime ministers â€” from Jawahal Lal Nehru to Rajiv Gandhi â€” for souring the country''s ties with China, Pakistan , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Also, the two visits of the prime minister to Pakistan have been successful in easing tensions with these neighbours.

Moreover, the feel-good factor due to his development agenda has boosted India''s image. Earlier taking to mediapersons at the residence of Dr Daljit Singh, Badal said the list of the party candidates for the Lok Sabha election was being short listed and that seat-sharing with its alliance partner would be conflict-free.

Countering Amarinder Singh for making corruption during Badal''s regime as a poll issue, Badal said:""We will bring before the public the excesses of Amarinder government and make the voter understand to what extent the corruption cases against SAD leaders are true.""

""The Vigilance Bureau has been misused to hound the opposition. But since the Amarinder government and his colleagues are faced with charges of corruption, he (Amarinder) should have resigned by now.""

Other prominent leaders to address the rally included former ministers Sewa Singh Sekhwan, Nirmal Singh Kahlon and MLA Capt Balbir Singh Bath who exhorted the party workers to defeat Congress candidates by voting for the SADBJP candidates during the Lok Sabha poll.

1,"Hooda's wife arrested, released","PANCHKULA: The police, on Sunday, formally arrested and released CLP leader Bhupinder Hooda''s wife Asha and a relative, Saroj, in dowry case registered against them at Sector 19 police station.

Meanwhile, the police have approach the US Embassy for serving arrest warrants on Hooda''s son, Dipender Hooda, who is also an accused in the case registered at the complaint of his wife Dr Geeta Grewal.

""Since they had already got an anticipatory bail from the sessions court, their arrest and release was a mere formality,"" an official of Sector 19 police station said.

Referring to Bhupinder Hooda''s arrest, the official said that the process was on and they had already sought permission from the Vidhan Sabha Speaker.

Confirming that the police would approach the US Embassy for serving arrest warrants on Dipender, sources said that the matter has been forwarded to director general (DG) of the crime investigations department (CID) for deciding further course of action. On January 19, Bhupinder Hooda, his wife Asha Hooda, son Dipender Hooda and a relative, Saroj Hooda, wife of Joginder Singh, were booked in a dowry case registered against them at Sector 19 police station.

Following this, Hooda''s had moved court for the grant of an anticipatory bail.

Initially, the plea was filed in the court of additional district and sessions judge (ADJ) H S Bhangoo, but it was later transferred to the court of district and sessions judge (DSJ) C B Janglian, who granted them bail on Saturday.

2,Mulayam wants RJD govt out,"PATNA: Samajwadi Party (SP) president and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday came down heavily on the RJD rule in Bihar and ruled out his support to it in future.

Addressing a public meeting here at Gandhi Maidan, he said that the ruling party in Bihar had disappointed common people during its 14-year rule. All these years, there has been no development in this state, he said. Mulayam conceded that earlier he had a soft corner for this government. But now, enough is enough and it should not continue any further.

He promised that he would not show softness towards Laloo and his party in future and appealed to all sections of people to extend support to the Samajwadi Party in the coming Lok Sabha election.

The SP chief''s strident criticism of the RJD government notwithstanding, he, along with party general secretary Amar Singh, called on chief minister Rabri Devi and RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav at the official residence of the chief minister.

While coming out of 1, Anne Marg, Amar Singh told mediamen that the Samajwadi Party would not join any front, but support the parties committed to secularism in the coming Lok Sabha election.

Mulayam said at the public meeting that political alliances don''t throw up political alternatives â€” it were the people who throw up alternatives through ballots. No government at the Centre would be formed in future without the support of Uttar Pradesh people, he said.

He said that the NDA''s claim of ""feel-good"" sentiment prevailing in the country was nothing but an eyewash. He said that the battle against communalism is being fought in Ganga-Yamuna ka doab and not elsewhere as Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi fall in Uttar Pradesh.

Samajwadi Party got a boost in the state with former finance minister and Vyavasayi Sangharsh Morcha (VSM) chief Shankar Prasad Tekriwal and other Morcha leaders joining it at the rally.

Immediately after his induction in the party, the SP chief appointed Tekriwal a member of the party''s parliamentary board. Another VSM leader Shahabuddin was appointed general secretary of the party. Former MLC Indra Kumar was appointed the party spokesperson.

Amar Singh, too, in his speech criticised the RJD and BJP. Earlier, the Congress Party, and now the BJP, were making us ""feel-good"" and not ""really good"".

3,PSUs' staff rally resolves to oust RJD-led govt,"PATNA: Hundreds of employees of different public sector undertakings of the state government took out a procession in the state capital on Sunday under the banner Bihar Rajya Sarkari Lok Upkram Bachao Sangharsh Morcha in support of their demands.

After passing through different thoroughfares, the procession turned into a rally at the Miller School ground under the presidentship of Shiv Kumar Yadav. A senior lawyer, Bipin Bihari Singh, inaugurated the rally.

Morcha convenor Ashwini Kumar said that the rally resolved to oust the RJD government, its Left allies and Congress. He said that the state government had forced the PSUs employees to die without any pecuniary benefit.

Morcha also took strong exception to the delay in payment of Rs 50 crore to the state PSUs employees as directed by the Patna High Court and appealed to the Justice (retd) Uday Sinha Committee to pay arr-ears to all the daily wagers and ad-hoc employees who have worked in a PSU for 20-25 years.

4,Dearth of engrs hits development schemes in state,"PATNA: Acute dearth of engineers in different departments has proved deterrent to the implementation of development schemes in the state.

Sub-ordinate engineers maintained that the claim of the state government that it is taking up developmental schemes is nothing, but a farce and an attempt to mislead the people of the state.

Bihar Sub-ordinate Engineers'' Association general secretary Kamlakant Sharma said, in a press release, that the implementation of Centrally or state-sponsored development schemes in the state is the responsibility of engineers, but a look at the abysmally low strength of engineers in the road construction department (RCD), water resources department (WRD) and public health and engineering department (PHED) would make it clear that the task is rather impossible.

There is no engineer-in-chief in the RCD. Similar is the situation in the WRD and PHED.

As for the chief engineers, Sharma said that against the 22 sanctioned posts the current strength is only one in WRD, only two are working against the sanctioned strength of 17 in RCD and four are working in PHED against 21.

Likewise the sanctioned posts of executive engineers is 547 in the RCD while 483 are working. Only 251 are working against the sanctioned strength of 486 in WRD and 50 are working in PHED against 62 in the same rank. About 50 per cent assistant engineers are working in all the three departments.

He said that the role of engineer-in-chief is very vital as he has to monitor the working of all the engineers down the line who are directly involved in carrying out developmental works, besides looking after the establishment.

Since there is not even a single engineer-in-chief in any of the three departments, the engineers down the line are mostly engaged in establishment work.

In such a scenario one could very well gauge the status of development in the state, he stated.

Sharma maintained that 7the state government is neither promoting or appointing new ones to fill the vacant posts.

If the government does not promote engineers, the association will launch an agitation, he added.

5,Ex-servicemen condemn violence by jawans,"PUNE: The strong-arm tactics employed by the army jawans against the residents of the Sopanbaug area and journalists on Saturday afternoon over the ownership of a road has drawn strong condemnation from all quarters, particularly ex-servicemen.

While both the army and the Sopanbaug residents preferred to lie low on Sunday, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)''s legal department chief, Ravindra Thorat, said late on Saturday evening that the PMC will file a special appeal in the district court on Monday, urging it to ""restrain defence officials from digging up the road"".

Former servicemen spoken to said that the army should refrain from taking the law into its own hands. Former Southern Command PRO Col. V.N. Tambekar (retd.) told TNN on Sunday that the army is not above the law, and cannot behave with civilians like they did on Saturday. ""How come no senior officer was present at the time of the incident?

Somebody should have rushed to the site,"" he said. Retired brigadier S.M. Rao said, ""The army should understand that it is part of a civilised society, and such incidents will only alienate it.""

The chairman of the Empress Garden View Society, Maj. Gen. P.D. Sherlekar (retd.), said, ""We can understand the army guarding the border, but beating up citizens and journalists is unacceptable.""

However, a senior army official said that defence land had a ""distinct character"" and that areas were deliber-Kulkarni, Pradeep Rawat and Vijay Kale are also seen. â€˜Army not above the law'' ately kept vacant for security and social reasons. ""Presently, 15 lakh-plus persons are with the services, of whom only 15 per cent have been allotted quarters. The army needs defence land for further expansion,"" he said.

According to army sources and environmentalists, some 9,000 acres of defence land across the country are facing the problem of encroachment. The responsibility to keep defence land encroachment-free is with the defence estates office under the Cantonment Act of 1924.

However, residents of the Pune cantonment believe it is the failure of the defence estate office (DEO) to do its job that leads to incidents such as the Sopanbaug one. One resident, Catherine Pinto, said the army was justifying its soldiers'' actions as an attempt to protect defence land.

""But were they sleeping all these years when the land was being encroached upon?"" she asked.

Local BJP activist Devendra Bhatia said the Pune cantonment area was awash with unauthorised constructions.

""The Pune cantonment board (PCB) officials are blatantly allowing such constructions. Nearly 90 per cent of the new buildings constructed in the PCB after 1980 have violated one rule or the other. Why isn''t the army taking action? Builders have stealthily converted parking space and basements into shopping malls,"" he said. The Sopanbaug incident was only waiting to happen.

Last May and June, Pune sub-area administrative commandant Col. Om Pawar had led a large contingent of jawans to stop work on the public road. When the police intervened, Pawar allegedly confiscated the keys of the on-site roadroller, besides threatening its contractor with dire consequences.

Earlier this week, a group of 20 soldiers from the Bombay Engineering Group (BEG) demolished a compound wall at Dhanori,which the residents claimed was legitimate as per PMC norms.

Justifying the Dhanori incident, BEG Training Battalion (TB-2) commandant Col K.K. Tikkoo told TNN that the wall of survey number-81 in Dhanori had been constructed on defence land, and was hence illegal.

6,Munde castigates party's city unit,"PUNE: BJP state unit chief Gopinath Munde on Sunday said that he would tour western Maharashtra from February 16 in the run-up to the forthcoming general elections.

Munde said he had thus accepted state home minister R.R. Patil''s recent challenge that NCP workers would not allow any BJP leader to ""set foot"" in the region because the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre had ""failed to release adequate drought funds"" to Maharashtra.

Addressing a rally of BJP workers here, ostensibly to announce new party office-bearers, Munde dared the Democratic Front government in the state to dissolve the state assembly.

""Last time, we sent Sharad Pawar packing, and it would not take much to do the same to Patil,"" he said.

Commenting on Pune, Munde said that if the saffron alliance came to power, he would release enough funds to solve all the problems facing the city, including its traffic woes. He also expressed concern over the city''s increasing crime rate.

Munde, in his one-and-a-half-hour speech, also touched upon the increasing infighting in the BJP city unit. ""This is not BJP culture,"" he told the rally.

""I see that individuals are considered more important than the party,"" he remarked.

Commenting on the party''s failure to elect ward-wise committees, Munde warned that those who tried to gain political mileage out of these elections would be removed from the party.

He directed party officials to ensure that all the ward committees were in place a month before the general elections.

Earlier, BJP state unit general secretary Vinod Tawade appointed Vijay Kale as the party city unit chief (Kale replaces Anil Shirole). Kale, in turn, named Vikas Mathkari, Suhas Sonawane and Gopal Chintal as general secretaries, and Ujjwal Keskar as the party leader in the Pune Municipal Corporation.

Kale later told the meeting that the BJP election campaign in Pune will be flagged off by Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi at a public rally here on February 26. He said the his party''s motto for the city was â€˜Safe Pune, developed Pune''.

8,Weed out rotten politics: Nitish,"PATNA: Chourasia Samaj should use its ""skill of scissor"" to weed out rotten politics and politicians from the political map of Bihar and give power in the hands of those who believe in service to the people and development of state said Railway Minister Nitish Kumar. He was addressing the Chourasia Rajnitik Sammellan here on Monday.

He said that his difference with Laloo Prasad Yadav started when he opposed him on the issue of equitable power sharing with the majority castes of OBC group, especially annexure I and II and contested proposed change in Karpoori Formula by him.

Kumar said that present regime in the state is opposed to development in Railways, National Highways and Thermal sectors as it openly says that issue of development has no relation with people.

He said the NDA government at the centre, after next Lok Sabha elections, is as certain as sunrise in the morning. He appealed to the Chourasia brethren of Bihar to join mainstream of development by voting NDA to power both in coming Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections in future.

Union minister for information and broadcasting, Ravishankar Prasad too called upon the Chourasia society to join NDA because of it being committed to the cause of development of India.

Both the union ministers extended their whole-hearted support to the demand of Chourasia Sabha of giving agriculture status to betel leaves (Paan) cultivation.

Both assured the audience that they would raise the issue before union agriculture minister, Rajah Singh and also prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They said that with their coming back to power after Lok Sabha polls the betel leaves cultivation would be given agriculture status.

Leader of opposition in state legislative council, Ganga Prasad inaugurated the conference by lighting candle. Prominent among the others addressing the conference was BJP MLA from Nokha, Rameshwar Prasad.

9,Pranab not averse to contesting polls,"KOLKATA: Keeping the option open for joining the fray, senior Congress leader and WBPCC President Pranab Mukherjee said he was not averse to contesting the coming Lok Sabha election in West Bengal if the party wanted.

""It is not my decision whether I shall contest the poll or not. Only the Congress President can take a decision on this. I will contest if the party asks me to do so,"" Mukherjee told newsmen when asked whether he would join the poll fray from Jangipur in Murshidabad district.

Mukherjee, a Rajya Sabha member, said the president of Murshidabad district Congress as well as some of ''my party colleagues'' requested him to contest the election.

He said he did not have any talk with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and no decision had been taken on my contesting the poll.

The WBPCC chief, who had discussed the party''s election strategy in the state with AICC observer Pratap Rao Bhosle, said two seats would be allocated to the Party for Democratic Socialism, a breakaway group of CPI(M).

The NCP led by Sharad Pawar had also requested for one seat in West Bengal though no decision has been taken whether to leave any seat to it or not, he said.

10,Bandhs to hit investments in Bengal: US consul,"KOLKATA: The many bandhs in Kolkata â€” two this month itself â€” are not doing West Bengal any good in attracting foreign investments, US consul general in Kolkata George Sibley said on Monday.

The tendency of the unionised workforce to wait for the perfect contracts to be drawn up before they got on with their jobs was also a big negative factor as far as doing business in the state â€” whose ""image in any case was much worse than reality"" â€” was concerned.

""West Bengal''s famous political passions still occasionally shut down the city, while Indiaâ€™s other economic centres continue with business as usual. It is undoubtedly an issue that will not work favourably for the state,"" Sibley said at a BNCCI-organised program.

Sibley has first-hand experience of the disruptions caused by bandhs. Last year, a bandh forced an important meeting to be cancelled at the US consulate in Kolkata. ""We had a drop in attendance this time (on bandh day last week),"" he said, while pointing out that even consular activity was not immune from the influence of bandhs.

Sibley said the state government would need to make sustained efforts to remove this ""impediment"" â€” a mindset that prompted a bandh-call ever so often â€” because ""it had taken deep roots here."" This was all the more essential since West Bengal and especially Kolkata was no longer the undisputed industrial centre of India.

""Labour relations have no doubt improved in recent years, but we still cannot say that ''work culture'' problems are a thing of the past. The government should tell them (the union leaders) that it is better to have a not-so-wonderful contract and plenty of jobs rather than a wonderful contract and no job,"" he said.

Sibley said the state''s infrastructure needs were ""enormous"" but admitted that these represented huge opportunities for those in the construction business. Kolkata would need to reinvent itself like Pittsburgh, which after a deep depression transformed itself in to one of the most ""liveable"" US cities, he added.

Sibley said there was huge scope for Indo-US trade, but pointed out that there were several tariff and non-tariff barriers in the way of US investments in the country.

11,"Poll-related violence feared in TN, Chhattisgarh, J&K","NEW DELHI: With intelligence agencies pointing to violence in Tamil Nadu, the nine extremism-affected states and J&K and the North-East due to poll boycott by militants and insurgents, the home ministry has asked the state police and Central paramilitary force chiefs to gear up for any eventuality.

Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and her children who are likely to campaign extensively besides BJP heavyweights like Vajpayee and Advani will top the security list.

In Tamil Nadu, the political equation recently changed with chief minister J Jayalalithaa announcing a poll alliance with the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and the DMK and PMK announcing an alliance with the Congress. All this has raised the political temperature and the intelligence agencies expect fierce elections in Tamil Nadu which would definitely call for a larger presence of Central forces there, a senior security officer said.

Compared to the 500 battalions of the Central paramilitary forces deployed all over the country in the last Lok Sabha election, more would be required this year, a senior official said.

""Holding a free and fair poll is not our responsibility. It is the job of the Election Commission,"" said minister of state for home I D Swami when asked about how the forces would be deployed. It is the EC which asks the home ministry to deploy Central forces depending on the demands made by the states, he said.

The EC along with the home ministry will have to assess the security scenario all over the country, including the logistics involving the deployment of paramilitary forces. Before the EC announces the poll dates, its officials will also have to take into account the topography of the place and its weather. For instance, in the snow-bound areas of J&K, Himachal and Uttaranchal, the polls will have to be staggered to a much later date, sources said.

Interestingly, there will be a lot of security confusion in some of the newly-created states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal, which will will witness a Lok Sabha poll for the fist time. In Uttaranchal, the division of IPS officers between it and Uttar Pradesh has not been completed. The cadre allotment of IPS officers between Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh is still to be finalised. A similar situation obtains between Bihar and Jharkhand. A number of security personnel are engaged in legal battles in Central Administrative Tribunals.
