17,"No liquor politics, promises Cong","bangalore: the ruling congress on sunday promised ``clean'' elections for the kanakapura lok sabha seat and said it would not indulge in ``liquor politics.'' earlier polls to the kanakapura parliamentary seat have been marked by extensive use of liquor and muscle power by all political parties. karnataka pradesh congress committee president allum veerabhadrappa, however, told reporters here: ``we will fight the by-election in a fair manner. supplying liquor is not part of our agenda.'' veerabhandrappa contended that it was their political opponents who indulged in unfair electoral practices. ``aren't we aware of the role of money and liquor during former prime minister h.d. deve gowda's tenure?'' he asked. flanked by home minister mallikarjun m. kharge, revenue minister h.c. srikantaiah and former chief minister m. veerappa moily, veerabhadrappa also refuted allegations of expected misuse of official machinery for the polls. the congress is not jittery about the unification of two janata dal factions which has resulted in the common candidature of gowda. ``we are not scared of anyone. they unite during elections and separate when in power. even people are aware of their misdeeds,'' he maintained. queried why the entire cabinet had to be present to campaign if the congress was so confident of victory, veerabhandrappa said: ``the cm and other ministers just went as party workers to campaign. it does not mean we are scared or weak.'' moily contended that the bjp and the janata dal factions had entered into an electoral agreement. ``the bjp's selection of candidate demonstrates that there is an understanding with gowda. so far, the bjp does not seem serious about contesting the election,'' he said. the by-election has been necessitated following the death of sitting congress mp m.v. chandrashekara murthy.

18,When bounced-cheque law stumped lawyers,"bangalore: ignorance of law is no excuse. that the law was misunderstood by scores of litigants and advocates at the five courts exclusively meant for hearing cheque dishonour cases in the city recently, showed it all. the issue that puzzled them was ``why were judges at the magistrate court continuing to try cheque dishonour cases even after four months into repealing the act which brought such cases under the purview of criminal courts''. the matter in doubt was the repealing and amending act 2001 which included the repealing of the banking, public financial institutions and negotiable instruments laws (amendment) act of 1988. that, for them, meant that henceforth no criminal action will be taken against the pending one lakh-plus cases of cheque dishonour. besides, the cases will only have to be tried in civil courts for recovery. ``the act has received the assent of the president of india and was published in the gazette of india on september 3, 2001. defaulters can now easily get away with civil court judgments,'' these `ignorant' advocates contended. even a few judges at the magistrate courts seem ignorant. ``it is an issue running into crores of rupees. we cannot act upon it as we have not received an official notification from the high court,'' they maintained. ``the confusion is baseless and unwarranted,'' senior counsel aver. ``section 4 of the very same act clearly states that the repeal by this act shall not effect any other enactment in which the repealed enactment has been applied, incorporated or referred to...'' senior counsel m.t. nanaiah explained. this means that although an amending act has been repealed since september, 2001, the changes that were made by the amending acts shall remain untouched. it may also be noted that a negotiable instruments (amendment) bill 2001 was introduced in the lok sabha in july 2001 in order to enhance punishment to offenders. the bill included increasing of the punishment from one year to two years and providing for summary trial of the cases under the act with a view to speeding up pending cases and make the offences under the act compoundable.

20,Key SC ruling on third party risk,"new delhi: vehicle owners be careful now to buy insurance policies for automobiles as the existing policy does not cover the third party risk. a constitution bench of the supreme court has held that the comprehensive policy based on estimated values of vehicles does not ""automatically"" cover the risk for which a specific agreement is essential and requisite premium must be paid to insurance companies. clearing doubts that the policy covers the entire risk, the bench headed by chief justice s p bharucha said that liability of an insurance company would be ""limited"" even if an insured person had taken the comprehensive policy. covering different aspects of insurance policies, the bench comprising justice bharucha, justice s s m quadri, justice u c banerjee, justice s n variava and justice shivraj v patil said without taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium for payment of compensation to a third party, insurance companies would be liable to the limited extent as stated in section 95 (2) of the motor vehicles act. ""the insurer would not be liable to pay the entire amount"" awarded by the motor accidents claim tribunal or any other forum. the judgment is a fallout of an insurance company's appeal challenging the delhi hc's order asking it to pay higher compensation to a road accident victim because the vehicle was covered by the comprehensive policy though it did not have separate agreement for third party insurance.
