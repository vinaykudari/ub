0,Huge crowd at farmer's bhog,"BATHINDA: Around 10,000 farmers, seething in rage and protesting against the state government and the Bathinda district administration for the lathicharge on the farmers at Bhai Bakhtaur, had assembled at the bhog ceremony of farmer Gurdev Singh here.

This was the biggest-ever gathering of farmers in the Malwa region.

The district administration had made all-out efforts to prevent the farmers from gathering on the bhog ceremony, but the massive turnout has put the authorities on tenterhooks.

The district administration was keeping a close vigil on the activities of the farmers'' leaders here and the houses of some of the leaders and workers were raided during the last one week to dissuade them from mobilising farmers.

However, on Friday, no policeman was visible in the village, but many police parties were reportedly camping in area 5 km from the village.

Meanwhile, the political parties and farmers'' leaders flayed the anti-farmers'' policies of the Union and state governments and lambasted chief minister Amarinder Singh for not keeping the promise of providing free power and water to farmers.

If farmers'' leaders urged the people to join hands in fighting the state government''s repression on farmers, the political leader tried to extract political mileage and gave a call to the farmers to give a befitting reply to the Congress in the next general elections.

Perhaps, it was the effect of the huge gathering that forced the district administration to take a prompt decision.

After getting a nod from Chandigarh, Joginder Singh Ugrah, BKUEkta president, who was in the Central Jail, Bathinda, since October 1, was released at about 5 pm on Friday, when the bhog ceremony at Maur Charat Singh Wala village was in progress.

Thousands of farmers did not leave the bhog ceremony till Ugrah reached the village and addressed the farmers.

Buckling under pressure, the district administration, reportedly, also agreed to enhance the compensation amount from Rs 2 lakh to 3.5 lakh to the deceased farmer''s kin and withdrawn all criminal cases registered against the kisan leaders, which one of the demands of the BKU-Ugrah group.

1,Local issues leave minister speechless,"PUNE: Guardian minister Vijaysinh Mohite-Patilâ€™s attempt to highlight the developmental works done by the Congress-NCP government in Pune backfired on Friday as the minister did not have anything to say on the key issues confronting the city.

Patil, who is also the PWD minister, was addressing a press conference on the developmental works undertaken by his government in Pune division in the last four years.

While he highlighted the road projects, worth Rs 140 crore, undertaken in the district, the minister declined comment on the on-going controversy over the Bharati Vidyapeeth road, where his colleague and fellow minister, Patangrao Kadam, is pressing for the deletion of the public road from the cityâ€™s development plan.

Asked about the governmentâ€™s policy on the proposal to delete the road (a vital link between Satara road and Ambegaon) from the development plan, Patil said: â€œI will communicate your feelings to the government.â€�

About the inordinate delay in completing the easterly bypass, which will help divert the traffic from Mumbai to Solapur and Ahmednagar, the guardian minister was once again at a loss for words.

PWD officials assisting Mohite-Patil said the work was being done by the Maharashtra state road development corporation (MSRDC) and that land acquisition hassles had delayed it.

Mohite-Patil also declined to comment on the controversy over the status of the Rs 260-crore budgetary allocation for the construction of flyovers in the city.

While senior Congressman and Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Kalmadi recently charged that the MSRDC had slashed the allocation to Rs 120 crore, minister of state for PWD Balasaheb Shivarkar claimed that nothing of this sort had been done.

5,Naidu rejects Central rule demand,"KOLKATA: BJP president Venkaiah Naidu on Friday lambasted the CPM''s ""contempt for an independent judiciary"". However, he tempered his criticism with praises for chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

Naidu also made it clear that the BJP leadership was not in favour of Central intervention, stating that there was no breakdown of Constitutional authority in West Bengal.

""What is happening here is scant respect of the Constitution by the Marxist party,"" he said.

Addressing a press conference in Kolkata, Naidu said, ""The BJP would like to know what is the official stand of the CPM towards the judiciary.""

Referring to Left Front chairman Biman Bose''s tirade against Justice Amitava Lala and his directive, he said the CPM should state publicly if it believed in the rule of law.

""The CPM central committee should clarify its stand on statements made by Biman Bose, Jyoti Basu and other party leaders,"" he said. There could be two opinions on a court judgement, but one should seek relief in a higher court rather than publicly condemn the judgement and the judge.

""Mercifully, the chief minister has not joined the bandwagon,"" he said. The emphasis in the state should be on improving the work culture. ""The new chief minister is working overtime for this."" It was noteworthy that Bhattacharjee and most of his Cabinet colleagues had stayed away from Wednesday'' Left Front convention against the court order.

""Processions can''t be banned in a vibrant democracy, but there must be regulations,"" the BJP president said.

""There is a need to understand the meaning of the court judgement. There has to be an understanding on how to conduct dharnas and protests.""Organised disruptions had led to economic decline of the state, he said.

To the common people, the judgement had come as a relief. Asked about NDA partner Trinamul Congress''s criticism of the judgement and its processions in the city, he said the Trinamul was entitled to holding its own opinion.

Calling for a consensus among political parties on the issue, he said if there was a problem in holding rallies only between 8 pm and 8 am, that, too, could be discussed and the government could come out with a proposal how to hold demonstrations without disruption.

6,First blow to rally ruling,"KOLKATA: Justice Lala''s order was flouted for the first time on Friday when a group of about 100 CPI(M-L) Liberation supporters stalled traffic in the heart of the city for an hour till four in the afternoon.

Police did nothing. Their excuse: they have not yet received the September 29 high court order banning rallies between 8 am and 8 pm on weekdays in the city.

The rally did not disrupt traffic, said Kuldeip Singh, DC (Headquarters).

â€œSeveral people called us to inform of a procession but when we reached there, just a few were seen walking but not in a procession,â€� he said.

But for an hour, the rallyists â€” holding hands to form a chain â€” had slowed traffic down on two of the city''s busiest streets â€” S.N. Banerjee Road and Lenin Sarani â€” to a crawl.

The ultra-Left supporters started converging on Raja Subodh Mullick Square around 3 pm. Policemen were present there in good numbers but did nothing to stop the procession when it started around 3:15 pm.

The protesters went via Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road to S.N. Banerjee Road, gathered for a while near Metro cinema â€” where meetings are banned â€” and came back to Subodh Mullick Square via Lenin Sarani. Initially, the protesters took over the entire road, blocking all traffic.

But when a senior police officer realised this, he created a single lane for the vehicles to move. This helped, but only just: it allowed for a trickle of cars when there should have been a flow.

SUCI â€” another ultra-Left party â€” delivered the second blow to Justice Lala''s order a little while later, around 5 pm. Some 30 of them gathered for a snap demonstration at Esplanade East. They choked the crossings for several minutes during rush hour, before the police swung into action. Fifteen SUCI supporters were arrested.

The DC said the two parties had never sought permission for the protests and whatever they knew they had gathered from their intelligence wing.

9,Nobody is above legislature: Law minister,"BANGALORE: Law and parliamentary affairs minister D B Chandre Gowda on Friday said Vishwabharati House Building Cooperative Society president B Krishna Bhat will be summoned to the House if he does not appear before the Legislative Council Privileges Committee in connection with a breach of privilege notice.

â€œNobody is above the legislature. He (Bhat) has to appear before the Committee and explain his case,â€™â€™ Gowda told reporters here.

When told that the court had stayed a summons notice issued by the Committee to Bhat, the minister felt it wasnâ€™t a â€œhealthy trend.â€™â€™ â€œThe legislature has every right to look into any act or incident that breaches the legislatorâ€™s privilege. There is no option other than summoning him to the House,â€™â€™ he added.

Bhat had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the High Court seeking a direction to the government not to fund legislatorsâ€™ foreign tour from the stateâ€™s exchequer. After the High Court dismissed the PIL, the legislators had moved a privilege motion against Bhat on the grounds that their prestige and honour had been blemished.

When asked about Public Accounts Committeeâ€™s complaint that the chief secretary had not turned up for a clarification despite repeated reminders, Gowda said: â€œEverybody has to respect the legislature and its subordinate bodiesâ€™â€™.

HC Bench: On the High Court Bench issue, the minister said agitations by North Karnataka Bar Associations had â€œalmost come to an endâ€™â€™.

â€œTwelve Bar Associations have conveyed their decision to the Chief Justice. Let us see, what will happen,â€™â€™ he stated.

Encroachment: With regard to evicting encroachers from Tatkola reserve forest in Chikmagalur district, Gowda said the government would make sincere efforts to rehabilitate the displaced families.

The Supreme Court made it clear that all encroachers should be evicted.

â€œHowever, there is confusion about Tatkola forest boundary. Unfortunately, the Centre is not interested in resolving the crisis. So, we are working on it,â€™â€™ he said.

10,Poetry inspires Vajpayee to get into election mode,"BANGKOK: A rendition by children of his poem Jung Na Hone Denge, an eager NRI audience Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee cast aside his exhaustion from a long trip. During the trip, he put up a stout defence of the performance of his government, Indiaâ€™s image problems abroad, Pakistan, starvation deaths and Gujarat riots. â€˜â€˜In government, my chaadar is clean.

There is no blot,â€™â€™ he told an appreciative audience. He also claimed that Indiaâ€™s prestige abroad had increased in recent years and his multi-party coalition government had not only provided stable but also good governance for five years. â€˜â€˜But if people do not like it,â€™â€™ Vajpayee said, â€˜â€˜and if they think he had not performed, I would deserve to be punished by them.â€™â€™

Vajpayee showcased many achievements of India under the NDA rule: The economy he said was strong and for that he praised external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha, who was earlier the finance minister, and also the present finance minister Jaswant Singh. He said both food stocks and forex reserves were overflowing. â€˜â€˜We did not let prices to rise despite the drought.â€™â€™

There were times when India had to sell gold abroad, now it is in a position to sell gold to others in the world market. The PM also took a swipe at the media for reporting cases of starvation deaths. He flatly denied it: â€˜â€˜Nobody died due to starvation or famine.â€™â€™ He only conceded that there might have been a mismanagement of the food distribution system. Vajpayee was in the rhetorical best when he dwelt on the Pakistan problem in Indiaâ€™s image abroad.

11,BJP eyes polls with `Mission-2004',"VARANASI: As part of its pre-Parliamentary election preparatory programme, `Mission-2004'', the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is going to hold a three-day training for its election planners at Belaridih village in Chandauli district from Saturday. The programme will be inaugurated by Union HRD minister, M M Joshi.

Talking to reporters on Friday, the BJP state unit assistant election planner and in-charge of Kashi and Gorakhpur regions, Jaiprakash Chaturvedi said that over 250 election planners from all districts of Kashi, Gorakhpur, Awadh and Kanpur regions would participate in the training camp. Keeping in view the forthcoming Parliamentary election, the BJP had made a 24-point programme `Mission-2004'', he said, adding that as per this programme, the participants would be trained with indepth knowledge of party''s ideology.

Besides, a comparative study of the Vajpayee government and previous governments would also be conducted, said Chaturvedi, adding that before sending them to their respective areas to prepare party workers, they would be apprised of the poll strategy for the election. He said the target and accountability of all election planners would also be fixed during the camp. He remarked that apart from Joshi, national training in-charge, Prof Bal Apte, in-charge of election for north India, Manohar Lal, in-charge of UP, Kalraj Mishra, former ministers Lalji Tandon and Om Prakash Singh and state president Vinay Katiyar would also participate in different sessions. The programme would be conducted in nine sessions.

Regarding the loss suffered by the BJP after forming alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the state, he said it was not an acceptable alliance. Neither the people nor party workers were in favour of this alliance, but due to political compulsions the alliance was formed to save the state from another election, he said. He added that secularists who were flocking together now were also not ready to join hands to form a government at that time. He said the BJP had not got any political benefit by forming such alliance. Fortunately that alliance ended early and the BJP had got more than a year to compensate its loss before the Parliamentary elections, he added.

About participation of BJP workers and leaders in the proposed `Ayodhya Chalo'' programme of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), he said they were free to participate in activities for the construction of temple in Ayodhya. The temple movement was a social issue and the BJP could never maintain distance from it, Chaturvedi said, adding that the BJP had not abandoned the temple issue, and there was no confrontation between the BJP and VHP on the issue.

12,'Sonia right in not joining UP govt',"KANPUR: Rajya Sabha MP and Congress member, Rajiv Shukla, feels that the decision of party president, Sonia Gandhi, to keep out of the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led coalition in Uttar Pradesh (UP) had rejuvenated the state unit. He was talking to the Times News Network here on Friday.

""We have taken a lead in fighting against communalism and have given support to the Samajwadi Party on our own terms, and conditions"" Shukla further said; while denying any resentment or rumours of split in the Congress legislature party. He claimed that many leaders who had left the party, were eager to make a comeback. ""I will not name them, but there are many in the queue"", he added.

The journalist-turned-politician further added that the Central Bureau of Investigation chargesheet against chief minister of Chattisgarh, Ajit Jogi, was a case of political vendetta, and a desperate effort by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to gain the support of the tribals in that state. He also slammed the BJP for framing charges against former CM of UP, Mayawati. Shukla said , ""Why the charges were not framed while she was the CM of the state?"", he asked. He said that the BJP''s malicious intentions and a perfectly executed plan, accounted for the downfall of the Mayawati government.

Shukla further said that he was satisfied with the performance of the city party unit. ""If the other city party units too, perform in the same manner, the party will bounce back in UP,"" he added. Admitting that the Congress committed mistakes in the earlier campaigns, he further added that the mistakes had been rectified, and the party would target the masses.

13,BJP high command may intervene in state unit polls,"DHARAMSALA: The BJP high command may be compelled to intervene in the election to be held for post of state unit of the party to be held by the end of this month owing to the fact that both the factions appear to be reluctant to agree to a consensus candidate.

The Dhumal faction which was holding an edge over the Shanta faction was lobbying hard in New Delhi to convince the party high command to evolve a consensus on the name of former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal for the post of state BJP president.

Sources in the Dhumal faction said hat it was confident of capturing the post of state BJP chief on the eve of elections being held as it has the backing of most of the 68 state council delegates who would take part in the election of the state BJP chief.

Sources further said that most of the party workers had asked election in-charge and BJP leader Sanjay Joshi and O P Kohli, in charge Himachal affairs to consider the name of Dhumal for the post of state BJP chief.

But on the other hand, the Shanta faction, which was reported to be on a weak wicket, was also involved in hectic lobbying to push Dhumal out of contention.

Sources in the Shanta faction reportedly told the high command that in case Dhumal was elected state BJP president, it could have detrimental impact on partyâ€™s prospects in the Lok Sabha elections to be held next year.

They said that party high command has been told that the present Congress regime headed by Virbhadra Singh could slap cases of corruption against Dhumal, which could put the BJP at disadvantage in the Lok Sabha elections.

Not only this, sources said it also told the high command that lack of consensus on the name of Dhumal would send a wrong message to the people that there was no unity within the party, which could have an adverse impact on the Parliamentary elections.

Besides this, the election for the state BJP chief''s post has also run into rough weather due to postponement of the election for the post of Kangra district unit BJP president. The elections in Kangra had been postponed due to controversy concerning the elections in three mandals of Gangath, Nupur and Pragpur.

The participation of Kangra in the election for the state BJP chief was absolutely vital as it is politically the most significant district in the state, since 22 per cent of the state council members from here take part in the election.

Political observers say that with both the factions not willing to arrive at a consensus, the intervention of the party high command could be imperative to resolve this matter. They said that high command would obviously be in favour of unanimous election of the state BJP chief as the election for the post would sent a signal among the people of state that the party was faction-ridden which could cost it dear in the Lok Sabha elections as was the case in Vidhan Sabha elections.

However, they said that another worry for the party would be that that the candidate to be elected as state BJP president should have an acceptability not only within the party but also among the people of state.

Antony said he would be going to Delhi next week to discuss party affairs with the high command.

""There will be crises for a government from time to time. They will be solved,"" Antony told reporters on his return from Chennai after attending the inauguration of the Rajiv Gandhi Memorial at Sriperumbudur.

Antony said he did not discuss party matters with AICC President Sonia Gandhi when they met at Sriperumbudur as ""the occasion was not proper for discussing politics.""
