13,Juveniles languish in jails due to govt apathy,"patna: over 800 cases are pending in different courts of the state as a result of which as many as 1,100 juveniles are languishing in jails. their trial is held up in courts at various stages because of the failure of the bihar government to constitute separate juvenile justice boards exclusively for trial of such cases at different levels under the juvenile justice (care and protection of children) act, 2000. the matter has created a piquant situation for the government with the jehanabad district and sessions judge seeking guidelines from the patna high court with regard to hearing and trial of juvenile cases under the new law. the state government was supposed to constitute juvenile justice boards in accordance with the new act well before april 2001. the bihar government appears to be indifferent to the actâ€™s objective of taking care of and providing protection to juveniles and having a child-friendly approach in the adjudication and disposal of such cases in the best interest of children and their ultimate rehabilitation. law department sources, however, said there might be some tangible progress in the constitution of boards following expected intervention of the patna high court in the wake of the jehanabad district and sessions judge referring the matter to the high court. referring to a juvenile allegedly involved in the senari massacre in jehanabad district and his case being separated from the other accused for trial â€œsignificantly under the juvenile justice act, 1986â€�, jehanabad district and sessions judge sudhanshu kumar lal has asked the patna high court if on account of the â€œfailure of authorities in constituting juvenile justice boards as required under section 4 of the act, which is causing hindrance/obstruction/failure of justice in the proceedings relating to juveniles in conflict with the law, the power conferred upon court of sessions under section 6(2) of the act can be extended to the trial of juveniles in conflict with the law by court of sessionsâ€�. lal has pointed out that the union government by virtue of power conferred under section 1(3) of the new act appointed april 01, 2001 as the date whereon the provisions of the act would come into force and hence courts invested with powers under the old act have become â€œfunctus-officio with effect from april 1, 2001â€�. but it is an anomalous and sorry state of affairs that for inaction of authorities by not constituting juvenile justice boards, a juvenile in conflict with the law has to bear its ill effects, and in case he is under incarceration, he has to remain as such without there being any progress in his case or matter, he added. lal has also pointed out that juveniles have been forced to suffer, which is denial of liberty and right to have speedy trial as they have to remain in custody for want of constitution of juvenile justice boards, making their condition more pitiable than the dreaded criminals undergoing trial by general court.

14,Varsity law faculty head removed,"mumbai: seven months after a mumbai university committee found law faculty head p.c. warke guilty of examination malpractice, the university has decided to remove him from the post.

warke had earlier been divested of his position as dean of the law faculty, but remained department head. on tuesday, however, the university''s board of examinations decided to remove him from that post, too.

``the move should have come much earlier,'''' a department head said. ``by letting a tainted person remain as head, the university was sending out wrong signals to all those breaking the rules''''.

a report submitted last august by the unfair means committee__which looks into cases of examination malpractice at the university__said that warke had wrongly increased the marks of an ll.m (master of law) student and recommended that he be excluded from all exam work.

the committee began work in march last year after the university''s examination section found certain documents in a consumer law answer-sheet assessed by warke. these included an advocate''s visiting card and a note saying that the student should be given 15 more marks to clear the exam. warke gave the student exactly 15 additional marks, which investigations later revealed, the student did not deserve.

though warke denied all allegations of malpractice, the committee asked two examiners to reassess the answer-sheet. both gave the students more or less her earlier marks, the unfair means committee stated in its report.

the university did act on the committee''s report, but faculty members felt that officials were wrong in letting warke remain as head. an association of law professors even sent letters to governor p.c. alexander, ex-officio chancellor of all universities in the state, demanding that action be taken against warke.

in its letter, the law professors association said that the university was selective in taking action against those found guilty of exam malpractice. ``no fir (first information report) has been filed against warke who continues to head the faculty,'''' says the letter, sent to the chancellor in march. the university filed firs in the case of four students__including that of former registrar a.m. murudkar''s son ajay__whose answer-sheets were found to have been tampered with.

tuesday''s action follows a missive from the chancellor''s office, it is learnt. sources said that the chancellor had asked the university for a report on the issue.

vice-chancellor b.l. mungekar told this newspaper that ``the case was reopened after the chancellor''s office forwarded some representations made to the governor''''. moreover, a university committee__appointed to decide what action should be taken against those guilty of examination malpractice__recently suggested that those indicted should not be allowed to hold any high positions. ``this rule was meant for colleges but we have now decided to implement it at the university level as well,'''' mungekar said.

asked why there was a delay in taking this step, the vice-chancellor said that the university had already removed warke from all work associated with exams. ``as head, he was not directly concerned with exams, and we did remove him from his deanship.''''

20,Intellectual farmer stirs hornet’s nest,"mumbai: not too many prominent intellectuals have been willing publicly to attack medha patkar or arundhati royâ€” the latter of gamine, christ-like fame. gail omvedt is unflinchingly one of them. an american sociologist and activist, she has lived in kasegaon, sangli, for nearly two decades. married to bharat patankar of a kunbi maratha farming family, she admits to being a lady farmerâ€”or whatever the feminine is of gentleman farmerâ€”cultivating sugarcane, jowar, vegetables and fruit, including kesar amba (saffron mango). she has been associated with sharad joshiâ€™s shetkari sanghatana and acknowledged for her contribution to the dalit, farmersâ€™ and womenâ€™s movements. her books include we will smash this prison: indian women in struggle and dalits and the democratic revolution. ms omvedt comes across as a formidable, nononsense figure. her simple cotton salwarkameez and americanaccented marathi do nothing to disarm. she was recently in the city for the release of her book growing up untouchable in india: a dalit autobiography (published by sage\ vistaar), a marathi translation of the late dalit writer vasant moonâ€™s vasti. she also gave a talk at mani bhavan on womenâ€™s movements in rural maharashtra. not long ago, she was in the limelight for her scathing open letter to arundhati roy. she accused the narmada bachao andolan of focusing on the dam-afflicted, but not the drought-afflicted, who were often forced to migrate (just as residents of dam-submerged villages) for lack of damchannelised water for agriculture. she also wanted to know why a movement that largely represented adivasis had no adivasis in its top rungs. ms omvedt is emphatic that big dams, if well-conceived, can be sustainable and decentralised. â€œwithout big dams like the koyna and warana in maharashtra, there would have been no prosperity in the region,â€™â€™ she says.â€œthose who talk of small dams and watershed development do not realise that many areas do not get sufficient rainfall to sustain these methods.â€™â€™ she was also disappointed that ms patkar did not insist, when dam-displaced families were rehabilitated, that land be jointly issued to men and their wives, instead of only the men. speaking of such precedents in maharashtra, she says,â€œthere are well over 300 villages in maharashtra, with at least a hundred families each, in which women own land.this is mainly due to the shetkari mahila aghadiâ€™s lakshmi mukti programme since the â€˜80s. men voluntarily transferred a piece of property in the names of their wives and daughters.â€™â€™ nonetheless, women farmers havenâ€™t been significantly empowered by the reservation of panchayat seats for women, ms omvedt says. â€œthere have been very mixed results. the rotation of reserved constituencies for women makes for instability,â€™â€™ she says. ms omvedt has also stirred a hornetâ€™s nest by supporting liberalisation in agriculture. â€œa decade of liberalisation has not been a disaster for indian capitalists, as was expected. in maharashtra and punjab, all cotton and wheat has to be sold to the state, but in madhya pradesh and andhra pradesh, cotton growers get higher prices in the open market. the central government also bans the export of produce like onions, which is unfair to the growers. the public distribution system (pds) is a mess.food stamps and an open market would definitely have helped,â€™â€™ she says. not everyone supports this view. sharit bhowmik, head of the sociology department, mumbai university, comments, â€œms omvedtâ€™s academic research and writings on the dalits have certainly helped bring these issues into mainstream consciousness. but her pro-liberalisation stance is myopic and of limited use to the rural poor unless there is land reform.while the open market system may fetch better prices for some farmers, an absence of artificially controlled prices and the pds will cause millions of rural and urban poor to suffer.a free market will leave them much worse off.â€™â€™ ramesh kamble, sociology professor at mumbai university, concurs, â€œms omvedtâ€™s work on the dalit movement, especially dalits and the democratic revolution, is an important one. it places the dalit movement as part of a larger democratic movement. but she has held an inconsistent position on liberalisation.you canâ€™t demand fundamental rights from the state such as education, health and land rights for women,and support the free market at the same time.â€�

22,More facilities for handicapped in govt offices,"pune: the city improvement committee (cic) has cleared the administrationâ€™s proposal to make it mandatory for government departments to provide ramps and spacious elevators for the handicapped while constructing new government buildings in the city. the cic meeting held on wednesday empowered the administration to carry out modifications to existing development control (dc) rules so that the proposal can be brought into force at the earliest. speaking to reporters here on wednesday, cic chairman abhay chhajed lauded the proposal pointing out that it will help physically handicapped persons to access government buildings easily. according to the proposal, building plans of new government offices will not be sanctioned unless they provide for one separate approach road to the building.this road should be strictly reserved for the handicapped. new government buildings will have to provide for a ramp. the ramp should be at least six foot wide and should not be less then 27 foot in length. the building should at least have one elevator which can easily accommodate a wheel chair and one separate toilet for handicapped people. the ramps and the approach road should be constructed using â€œnon-slipperyâ€� material, the proposal states. the cic meeting also cleared the estimates for several other public works. the works and their estimated costs are: construction of the bhairobanala sewage treatment plant (stp) which will have a capacity to treat 130 million litres of sewage per day (rs 37.53 crore), construction of a 20-mld stp at vitthalwadi (rs 5.17 crore), construction of a retaining wall around the urali-devachi garbage depot (rs 30 lakh) and retaining wall around the now-abandoned paud road garbage depot (rs 25 lakh).

23,Three killed in Kalyan violence,"kalyan: three persons were left dead in kalyan and curfew was imposed in the bazarpeth area on wednesday following a tiff between a rickshaw driver from the minority community and a passenger from the majority community a day earlier, sparking off a night of violence and rioting. houses and shops were set ablaze and groups threw stones at each other. incidents of stone-throwing were reported as late as wednesday afternoon in the rohidaswada area in the old township. a mob pulled shiv sena worker ashok walunj (34) out of his house on tuesday night and lynched him, even though he had reportedly nothing to do with the autorickshaw incident. his aunt, ambika walunj (65), who watched his murder, reportedly died of shock. as groups battled each other, the police opened fire in the air, allegedly killing a woman named nusrat sheikh. inspector g.t. mali of the bazarpeth police station was injured in a mob attack, said kiran shelar, the zonal deputy commissioner of police. the police, led by commissioner s.m. shangari, rushed additional forces to the spot and brought the situation under control in the early hours of wednesday. around 10 a.m. on wednesday, minister of state for home kripashankar singhâ€”who rushed here from aurangabadâ€”gave mediapersons a tour of the troubled area. he told reporters that the police had fired 14 rounds to control the rioters on tuesday night, but he denied that anyone had been killed in the shooting. mr singh said that 1,500 policemen, including members of the rapid action force and the state reserve force, had been stationed in the area. â€œi am in constant touch with chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on the phone. we have also ordered a statewide alert in order to prevent any untoward incidents anywhere,â€™â€™ he said. he added that the situation in kalyan was tense but under control. however, a couple of hours after mr singh briefed the media, fresh incidents of stone-pelting were reported. at about 1 p.m., even as reporters were visiting the burnt houses and shops, some people started hurling stones at the police force stationed on ambedkar road, which leads to rohidaswada, a colony of cobblers. lathi-wielding policemen chased away the trouble-makers. mr singh, who was at the state rest house with the thane police commissioner and district collector i.s. chhahal, rushed to the spot.he then ordered that the entire town be put under curfew. mr chhahal said a report about the loss of property would be submitted to mr singh by thursday. curfew for most of kalyan was lifted at about 6 p.m. after mr walunjâ€™s funeral, but restrictions remained in force in bazarpeth. although the altercation over the rickshaw fare was said to have provoked the violence, local residents allege that the riot had been pre-planned. they said that the rioters decided to strike knowing that many shiv sena workers were in shirdi attending their partyâ€™s convention.

24,"IAS, IPS bodies fight shy of riots meeting","gandhinagar/ahmedabad: bureaucrats and police officers are getting all the flak for toeing the political line during the gujarat riots but attempts by a section of officers to discuss their role through their respective associations are coming a cropper. while dissent is brewing, both the ips and the ias associations have not been able to hold their meetings, despite requisitions from members, and there are reasons to believe this could be due to fear of reprisals from the political leadership . a meeting of the ias officers'' association was scheduled for tuesday evening in van chetna, a state forest department centre, but was cancelled, reportedly after a telephone call from the chief minister''s office to the association secretary dinanath pandey. on march 21, forests and environment secretary p k ghosh wrote to the association, to hold a joint informal meeting of ias and ips officers to discuss out ''certain conceptual issues'' in solving the current communal situation. ghosh''s letter was discussed by his junior and senior colleagues over and over again, several venues were chosen and rejected, and finally it was decided to hold the meeting at van chetna. the ias officers, however, decided to meet separately. however, many of them declared that they were not willing mainly because it could become an occasion for the cm to ''spy'' on them and know what they felt about the government. on tuesday morning, the cm decided to act. first pandey was told to cancel the meeting. then, ghosh was contacted and told that van chetna could not be allowed as venue. he was even told that the cm did not appreciate the idea of a meeting. thereafter, four ias officers - ghosh, general administration secretary anuradha mansingh, finance secretary sudhir mankad and food and civil supplies secretary h.k. dash - were asked to convince their colleagues about the need to ''postpone'' the meeting. the story about the ips officers is also quite curious. after having decided to call a general body meeting to discuss problems nagging the cadre, the ips officers association is now wondering if it would be worth the while, since several officers are divided over the manner of treatment of the riots by their colleagues. certain officers, specially of the rank of superintendent deputy inspector general posted in cities and districts, feel ''let down by their seniors so far as the law and order assessment in the post-godhra scenario goes''. in fact officers are fearing that the pow-wow session might turn stormy and the veil of fraternity in the cadre might fall. senior officers say that director general of police k chakravarthi has been approached to call a meeting but there has been no committed initiative yet. further, ''officers have been generally busy in maintenance of law and order since curfew is still on in several towns and then there was the prime minister''s visit, so one could not leave their positions'', says association secretary satish sharma. earlier, the association had decided to meet over the controversial transfers where certain dsps were shifted out for allegedly not toeing the government line.

26,Bring builders under licensing law: CERC,"ahmedabad: consumer education and research centre (cerc), ahmedabad, has called upon the central government to enact a separate law - builders'' licensing boards act - to curb the arbitrary manner in which builders have been functioning all over the country. in a written representation to shanta kumar, union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution, cerc said that such a board has become necessary following the increasing number of complaints by house and flat owners against builders. the complaints include unsafe and poor quality construction and allied work, delayed possession, violation of floor space index (fsi) regulations, misuse of open parking space for construction of shops and godowns causing traffic safety hazards, diversion of funds collected for maintenance and so on. a builder had even killed a consumer and the incident was reported in the media. cerc has enclosed press clippings of the incident along with its representation. there is a greater need for regulation and enactment of such a law, as the stakes are much higher in the construction industry than in other products and services, the representation added. in fact, consumers invest the highest amount in housing and are also attached to their houses emotionally. they not only invest their savings and other assets in housing but also often borrow money for the purpose. therefore, the need for consumer protection in housing is much greater than in any other field. the representation pointed out that laws such as the builders'' licensing boards act exist in countries like the usa, australia, etc. the board regulates and controls implementation of contracts, strikes down unfair terms of contract, collects deposits from consumers for rectification of defects, requests builders to apply for licence for initiating or continuing construction and allied activities such as piping, drainage, wiring, etc., inspects buildings, and advises consumers on purchase of second-hand flats and houses. in sum, cerc said the ""extremely unequal"" relationship between consumers and builders is heavily tilted in favour of the latter. ""the consumer has to live in poor quality houses for 30-50 years"" and in addition to the cost of the house or flat, has to incur much more for repairs of faulty construction. cerc had made a similar representation to the ministry in the wake of the earthquake in gujarat when a large number of buildings with faulty construction had collapsed, killing thousands of people.

27,Strict vigil for varsity law exams,"lucknow: law examinations in the capital began under tight police bandobast on wednesday. police laid siege to the entire pg block where 450-odd law (semester-ii) examimees were to appear for the examinations. lu authorities said it was a â€˜historical momentâ€™ as it was for the first time in the last 30 years that they were able to conduct the examinations alongwith the annual examinations currently underway in the lu campus and 28 associated colleges. two platoons of the provincial arms constabulary and dozens of police constables surrounded the pg block half an hour before the examinations. with theh superintendent of police (trans-gomti) at command, circle officer mahanagar, two station officers, six inspectors and couple of mounted police were put on guard at the entrance gates. anti-riot vehicles, tear gas squads and police patrol cars were also kept on stand by. the 28-member lu proctorial board team alongwith over a dozen senior teachers were also present to ensure the smooth conduct of the examination. examinees were asked to line up in front of the pg block and were frisked by the police and teachers before being allowed to enter. once they were inside, all gates were sealed and no outsider was allowed to enter the premises. agitated over the strictness, students raised anti-v-c slogans and entered into verbal disputes with the police on two occasions. however, the examinations went off peacefully. later, the pro-vice-chancellor conducted search operations in each classroom, followed by a detail inspection by vice-chancellor prof s b singh. as many as 27 students were caught with copying material. lu officials were surprised at the number of students who managed to smuggle in chits and copying material despite the strict checking at the gates. the law examinations in lucknow university are infamous for violence, and beating up of teachers, with examinees indulging in large scale copying. in january, six teachers were assaulted by examinees, resulting in an examination being postponed, after law students went on a rampage protesting strictness during the examinations. the dean, faculty of law, prof r p singh said it was indeed a historic moment for l u, as since 1973, after the pac revolt, no lu administration had ever dared hold the law examinations alongwith the annual examinations, due to the rowdy nature of the students.

28,Police disallow Cong protest plans,"ahmedabad: ahmedabad police commissioner pc pande''s denial of permission to the gujarat congress to stage demonstrations from thursday demanding removal of chief minister narendra modi, has upset the party''s plans, forcing it to shift focus to the taluka and district levels. earlier, the party had announced that it would stage this demonstration either at the town hall or lal darwaja in the city. but they did not get permission for this. condemning the attack on mediapersons at the sabarmati ashram on sunday, the party had decided to take up this campaign as part of its programme to create public opinion in the build-up to the assembly elections scheduled for next year. the decision was taken at the congress working committee meeting held in new delhi on monday. congress vice-president balubhai patel told tnn that the party workers would continue to lodge protests in their respective ward localities, wearing black bands. ""the police told us that under the prevailing circumstances it is better that we don''t assemble at any place,"" says patel. the proposed campaign against modi may have fizzled out but congress legislature party chief naresh raval says, ""we will throw up a surprise tomorrow!"" at one point of time, the party had also decided to go ahead with the programme and court arrest, in order to have an impact, said sources.

29,Delay in CLP leader's election,"lucknow: delay in election of the congress legislature party leader has led to a piquant situation in state unit of the party. shri prakash jaiswal, state unit president, dismisses the issue â€œas of little consequence during governorâ€™s rule in the stateâ€�. talking to mediapersons on wednesday, he said that election could wait, as, with the assembly in suspended animation, mlas had no role to play. political observes, however, find the delay quite intriguing as all major parties in the state, including the bharatiya janata party, the bahujan samaj party, the samajwadi party and even the fledgling rashtriya kranti dal (with five mlas) of kalyan singh, have been extremely prompt with the mandatory exercise. pramod tiwari, who has held the charge since 1991, sounds confident of being re-elected this time also. his party colleagues, however, do not share his views. â€œthe delay indicates a definite change in the offing. tiwariâ€™s virtual monopoly of the post had led to a near revolt in the party earlier and was also the reason for the congress split in 1997,â€� they argue, adding that â€œthis time the stage is set for a new entrant, most probably either ram naresh yadav or jagdambika pal.â€� weighing heavily against tiwari this time is his proximity to gulam nabi azad, they point out. tiwari, they claim, had a key role to play in selection of candidates in the february assembly elections, in which the party performed poorly. the issue has already snowballed into a major controversy, with charges of favouritism and high-handedness flying thick and fast. the central leadership, which has been apprised of the facts, may not be favourably inclined towards tiwari. moreover, his closeness with the samajwadi party, say his detractors, is well known to all. vociferous supporter of an sp-congress tie-up in the state, tiwari had lobbied hard for a coalition government. talking to times news network, a senior leader of the party accused tiwari of encouraging indiscipline in the party, which led to the defeat of inder khosla, the congress nominee, despite a party whip during the last rajya sabha election. this led to considerable embarrassment for the party, he said. tiwari, on his part, sees no competitor. â€œi have stood by the party through thick and thin and even resisted the offer of a deputy chief ministership in 1996. the high command is well aware of the facts.â€� delay in election of the clp leadership, however, was not a new thing. even last time the clp leader was elected a month after the election results, tiwari said. dismissing the whispering campaign â€œengineered by old rivals in the partyâ€�, tiwari is quite sure that the party high command will not bypass him.

30,Hint of normalcy in riot-affected areas,"ahmedabad: the city is clinging on to the hope that peace will finally return after nearly 40 days of violence. and if the traffic jams in the old parts of the city and the brisk business activities around the markets are any indication, there are certainly signs that some semblance of normalcy is indeed returning. a sizeable number of people were seen assembling at the siddi sayed-ni-jali mosque at lal darwaza on tuesday evening. the road that has always been a parameter to gauge communal tension, appeared crowded with a large number of shops open. ""things have been in a disarray for long and for people like me, who survive on daily earnings, it is really difficult"", said sameer shah, who runs a kiosk in kalupur. shah, a resident of sabarmati, sells cigarettes and other tobacco products on relief road. but the fear and mistrust generated during the communal clashes is still evident. most of the shops kept their shutters half open , ready to pack up at the slightest hint of trouble breaking out. in fact, people ventured out only in those areas where they felt more comfortable. ""i had a mixed clientele but now some of the known faces who frequented my shop are missing"", says shah. yonus merchant, a wholesale dealer of office stationary was worried about the way his business has been hit. his shop, located in an alley along relief road is doing badly as he claims 95 per cent of his buyers were hindus. ""it seems that it would be long before people dare to move around freely, with no inhibitions"" he said. ""people are scared to be on foot and even for small distances they prefer to have a vehicle with them"", said afzal ahmed, a small-time travel agent. merchant says many clients prefer to call up on phone seeking delivery of goods as they prefer not to venture into the area. but many people are slowly venturing out due to economic reasons, shedding their apprehensions. ramdas, a handcart puller, says, ""religion does not matter to me as i earn my daily bread through the work that traders give"". the cart pullers and the loaders, who translocate consignments from shops to godowns, irrespective of the religion of their hirers have been badly hit by the riots. however, before the sun could set, curfew is reimposed by the administration.

31,Bihar govt under assessed sales tax: CAG,"patna: the comptroller and auditor general (cag) of india has severely indicted the sales tax department in bihar for incorrect allowance of exemption from tax, non-levy of penalty, short levy of additional tax, surcharge and other irregularities worth over rs 125.95 crore during 1999-2000. the cag in its report for the year ended march 31, 2000 says the test check of the records relating to assessments and refund of sales tax in various commercial taxes circles, conducted in audit during the year 1999-2000 revealed under assessment of tax of rs 125.95 crore in 878 cases. during the year 1999-2000, the concerned department accepted under assessment of rs 152.39 lakh involved in 93 cases pointed out in earlier years. citing a few illustrative cases involving tax effect of rs 34.48 crore, the report says under the bihar finance act, 1981 read with the central sales tax (cst) act, 1956, if the prescribed authority has reason to believe that the dealer has concealed, omitted or failed to disclose willfully the particulars of turnover or has furnished incorrect particulars of such turnover and thereby returned figure below the real amount. the said authority shall assess or re-assess the amount of tax due from the dealer in respect of such turnover and shall direct the dealer to pay, besides the tax assessed on escaped turnover, penalty not not exceeding three times but not not less than an amount equivalent to the amount of tax on the escaped turnover. during the course of audit between feb 1999 and mar 2000, it was noticed from the assessment records (assessed between may 1995 and march 1999) and utilisation certificate of declaration forms that 54 dealers of 22 commercial taxes circles suppressed sales turnover of rs 5439.50 lakh bought /sold on declaration forms during the years between 1993-94 and 1997-98 which remained undetected by the department. the failure of the department to check concealment of purchases/sales resulted in under assessment of tax amounting to rs 924.34 lakh (including additional tax, surcharge and minimum leviable penalty). on these being pointed out (between february 1999 and march 2000), the department raised (between february and april 2000) additional demand of rs 7.50 lakh in four cases and in other cases stated (between july 1999 and march 2000) that the cases would be reviewed and further reply has not been received (janary 2001), it points out. under provisions of the bihar finance act, 1981, with effect from august 11, 1989, every dealer whose gross turnover during a year exceeds rs 10 lakh shall pay a surcharge at the rate of 10 per cent of tax (including additional tax) payable by him. in two commercial taxes circles (samastipur and central circle, calcutta), the assessing authorities while finalising the assessment in march 1997, 1998 and april 1999 of two dealers engaged in the sale of jute bags and petroleum products for the years 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1995-96 levied surcharge on the amount of tax of rs 21593.98 lakh instead of the correct amount of tax of rs 26805.11 lakh payable by them. this resulted in short levy of surcharge of rs 521.11 lakh. on these being pointed out (between jun 1999 and mar 2000), the department raised (nov 1999) an additional demand for rs 4.85 lakh in one case and said the other case would be reviewed and further reply has not been received (jan 2001). under the bihar finance act 1981, gross turnover for the purpose of levy of sales tax, in respect of sales of goods, means aggregate of sales prices received and receivable by a dealer during any given period. in four commercial taxes circles, four dealers made sale of medicine, coal, mustard oil, vanaspati, high speed diesel and diesel oil. valued at rs 47912.78 lakh as per the returns filed between 1991-92 and 1996-97 by them but their gross turnover was incorrectly determined (between march 1997 and february 1999) at rs 47548.39 lakh, the report says. this resulted in short determination of gross turnover by rs 364.39 lakh and consequential short levy of tax amounting to rs 46.71 lakh (including additional tax and surcharge). on incorrect grant of exemption, the report says by a notification issued in december 1995, sale of hdpe bags was exempted from levy of sales tax on the condition that the dealer must not have opted for deferment. on under assessment of central tax, it says under the cst act, 1956, on the inter-state sale of goods (other than declared goods) which are not supported by prescribed declaration forms, tax is leviable at the rate of 10 per cent or at the rate applicable in the state, whichever is higher. in four circles, though the sale of goods valued at rs 22308.3 lakh made by six dealers during the assessment years (between 1990-91 and 19996-97) was not supported by prescribed declaration forms, tax was levied at lower rates.

36,Amarinder govt still in state of inaction,"chandigarh: more than a month after amarinder singh was sworn in as the punjab chief minister, the state government still appears to be in limbo with the interminable delay in effecting transfers and getting on with business of government. a month on and no major decision has been taken by ministers in departments like revenue and transport with files that have been sent to ministers lying with them.â€˜â€˜it might be early days but by now a certain momentum should have been evident,â€� a senior secretary to the state government said on the state of affairs that prevails in the corridors of bureaucracy. the result of the chief minister not being regularly present is that many of the secretaries are also not found in the secretariat. â€œthe budget and financial allocations for various departments have not been made and as long as the budget is not presented no major financial decision can be taken by senior officials, which explains why no major decisions are being taken in various departments,â€� the official added. then there are problems that continue from earlier times.employees of the state government, many of whom come from mohali and other areas relatively away from the workplace, do not come at the right time as the bus that brings them to the secretariat with subsidised fares, does not arrive before 9.30 am and is often late. â€œprecious time is lost this way and when asked why they come late the employees say that they cannot spend rs 10 per trip to the office on a local bus,â€� another senior official says. at another level officials say that files pertaining to important issues are yet to begin circulation and it is issues that are not so important that are being discussed. â€œthere are issues like reviving octroi, special road tax, and going in for resource mobilisation that have to be addressed speedily to ensure that the stateâ€™s economy is put back on rails. these issues have not been discussed so far. the government has so far not even completed all the transfers that it wants to make,â€� another secretary-level official said.

37,Trinamul leaders overstep party line,"kolkata: discontent simmering in trinamul congress in the wake of rajya sabha elections is gaining in momentum. on thursday, while paresh pal and tarak banerjee went ahead with his programme of burning prime minister atal behari vajpayee's effigy over gujarat violence, violating the party line, president of all india trinamul youth congress nirbed roy expressed his reservation over inviting pds leaders to the party's sit-in demonstration on wednesday. on gujarat violence, the trinamul congress has demanded chief minister narendra modi's resignation. at the same time, the party extended all-round support to prime minister vajpayee who, the party, felt was the only person who can bring the situation under control. pal and his followers burnt effigies of vajpayee and narendra modi and demanded the resignation of both for their failure to bring the situation in gujarat under control. as a result, pal and banerjee's action on thursday was in complete violation of trinamul's party line. trinamul chief mamata banerjee was categorical in denouncing pal's programme. the party has nothing to do and does not endorse the programme undertaken by paresh pal. he holds no party post and is a mere mla. our legislature party will take action against pal and others, said mamata banerjee, speaking to reporters. though party flags were liberally used, banerjee argued that pal had not organised the programme under the party banner. if pal was openly falling out of the party line, nirbed roy's dissidence was more subtle. though being a senior party office-bearer, roy questioned the prudence behind inviting pds leaders samir putatunda and others to trinamul's sit-in demonstration against political violence on wednesday. any alliance with the left parties has not turned out to be beneficial for anti-left forces in the state, roy told tnn. he argued that during the bjp-trinamul alliance, it was the bjp that had benefitted. by entering into a seat adjustment before the assembly election, the congress could isolate the trinamul and paid back by engineering defection in the party during the rajya sabha. i think trinamul has been far more successful, whenever it has gone alone, roy told tnn. the trinamul supremo tried her best to underplay roy's reservations. pds' presence at the meeting was not indicative of any alliance and was merely a show of courtesy and was strictly issue-based, banerjee said.
