0,Engg students protest discrimination,"LUCKNOW: Students of private engineering colleges shot another petition to chief minister Mayawati and the higher education minister alleging discriminatory approach by evaluators in evaluation of B Tech semester III examinations on Saturday. However, UP State Technical University (UPSTU) officers described the campaign as a sponsored one.

Vice-chancellor DS Chauhan though avoided any direct answers in this regard, but said â€œwhen six out of ten toppers are from private engineering colleges and above 30 per cent of total students have passed, how come anybody charge us for discrimination?â€� â€œShilpa Tyagi of College of Engineering Roorkee has topped the examinations with 87.301 per cent marks, so how come there could be any discrimination,â€� he said.

While presenting universityâ€™s case before media persons, he said all the directors of the private engineering colleges have been asked to come with the cases where they feel less marks have been given to the students and university was ready to have an re-assessment done by a panel comprising a professor of IIT standard and representative of the private colleges. Further more, university evaluation process has no scope of manipulation.

â€œThe answer-copies are coded before being sent for evaluation, which is done at four centres in the state, namely Government Engineering Colleges of Kanpur, Sultanpur, Lucknow and Jhansi,â€� he said.

Teachers having experience of at least three years of private and government colleges evaluate these copies. First, with the help of the head examiners all the answers are solved and criterion of allotment of marks is set. After evaluation a senior professor conducts a random checking of ten per cent of the answer-copies. A second round of calculation of marks is done and collation of marks is done twice before declaring final results. He said that results of 600 students were withheld out of 10,600 students from all over the state because of some reason or the other. In some cases roll number were missing, in other cases marks of internal examinations were not provided by the concerned colleges.

All are now being cleared gradually, he said. He said as per AICTE guidelines 25 per cent marks are for internal performance and 75 for external exams.

1,"LS, assembly polls can be contested from two places","ALLAHABAD: A division bench of the Allahabad High Court, consisting of Justice M Katju and Justice Rakesh Tiwari, has upheld the validity of Section 33 (7) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, whereby it has been provided that a person can contest assembly or parliamentary elections from two constituencies.

The High Cour bench dismissed a writ petition filed by an advocate of the Allahabad High Court SK Garg, who challenged the validity of Section 33 (7) of the said Act on various grounds and sought relief from the court to declare the said section ultra-vires to the Constitution of India.

The counsel had moved the court that one should not be permitted to contest the Parliamentary or Assembly election from more than one constituency.

While, dismissing the writ petition, the judges said, â€œWe are of the view that although a person can vote from only one place, there is no bar from his contesting election from two placesâ€�.

The court said there is already a restriction from contesting election from more than two places as has been inserted by section 33(7) of the above Act, and thus it can not be said to be unconstitutional.

Liquor shops case: The hearing of the allotment of liquor shops case, was adjourned on Friday till May 21 by a three-judge bench, consisting of Chief Justice SK Sen, Justice SR Alam and Justice VM Sahai.

In the writ petitions filed in the high court, denial of renewal of licences and in some cases validity of allotment policy by the excise department have been challenged.

3,No holidays for Vajpayee and his ministers,"NEW DELHI: The heat is on. But this time thereâ€™s no escaping the ruthless Delhi weather for many in the government as a political storm is brewing and war clouds are visible on the horizon.

As the budget session of Parliament ends, itâ€™s that time of the year when our ministers take their long summer breaks â€” vacations or junkets â€” to escape the heat and dust of the Capital.

But unlike every other year, many of the usual holidayers are either calling off their vacation or cutting it short or contemplating whether it would be alright to leave town at a time when a cabinet reshuffle is well on the cards and a hype over the Indo-Pak stand-off has gained ground.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeâ€™s vacation to his favourite hill station Manali has been called off because a war-like situation has arisen. The trip was first cut short and it was decided that he would go for five days on May 24. But even that stands cancelled as of Friday night.

In fact, on Friday night, the Prime Minister asked all cabinet committee on security members to cancel their official trips or vacations and remain in Delhi in view of the emerging situation.

Home minister L K Advani had plans to holiday in Shimla after Vajpayee returned from Manali, but even that has been cancelled as of now. Scheduled for an official visit to London in June, Advani had planned the Shimla trip for the family vacation is out of the question as his wife Kamala has a problem travelling in aircraft.

External affairs minister Jaswant Singh was scheduled to visit African countries on an official trip but that has also been cancelled.

Tense ministers are afraid they may be dropped. There are those who feel their portfolios may change. Hence, many have decided to stay in Delhi and lobby for good portfolios rather than go out on a holiday.

Also, political busybodies donâ€™t want to go out of circulation at a crucial time, when an Indo-Pak war hype has been created, so that they can prove their mettle if a crisis situation arises.

I&B minister Sushma Swaraj is headed for the Cannes film festival and is supposed to return via London, where her daughter studies.

Law minister Arun Jaitley, who always takes a long vacation abroad during the summer, will be going to Geneva on an official visit, but without his family.

Civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain has left with a team of tourism ministers from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Goa and some other states for Muskat, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. He has combined work with vacation and is travelling with his family.

Parliamentary affairs minister Pramod Mahajan, who takes a break every year in the summers with his family, is not going anywhere this time.

4,Cong win predicted in civic polls,"CHANDIGARH: After being humbled in the last Vidhan Sabha elections, the SAD-BJP combine faces another round of confrontation with the Congress when elections to the four municipal corporations take place on Sunday.

The Congress, riding on the crest of the anti-corruption wave of chief minister Amarinder Singh, is expected to capture all the four corporations in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Patiala. While the Patiala corporation has its first election after inception, at rest of the three corporations the SAD-BJP combine enjoyed a majority in the outgoing houses.

As the Congress captured 10 of the 12 Vidhan Sabha seats in the four cities in the last election, the SAD-BJP combine faces an uphill task to improve its prospects in the corporation elections, particularly because ever since the Amarinder Singh government assumed power, its stock has not declined in any manner even as the anti-corruption campaign reflected in the Sidhu and Langah cases has won it applauds.

While Amritsar and Ludhiana corporations would witness election to 70 seats each, the number of seats in Jalandhar is 50 and in Patiala 40.

5,"Area under paddy could increase, says expert","PATHANKOT: Despite farm experts having repeatedly made recommendations on changing the cropping pattern, the farmers could increase the area under paddy cultivation so long as the government continues with the Minimum Support Price (MSP).

Talking to the Times News Network, Gurdaspur PAU associate dean Dr Paramjit Singh Kahlon, said that the PAU has asked the farmers to avoid sowing coarse and semicoarse foodgrains.

Farmers have instead been asked to increase the area under basmati cultivation for which Gurdaspur district is known worldwide. â€˜â€˜We are expecting a shift of five to 10 per cent, from coarse grain to basmati, in Gurdaspur. As has been in the past area under paddy cultivation could increase,â€™â€™ said Kahlon.

Citing statistics to support his claim, Kahlon who also heads the PAU extension education wing at Gurdaspur said, the yield of wheat crop was little less than usual this season, while the area under paddy last season was 1,91,000 hectares in the district, the average yield was 2,980 kg per hectare and the total paddy production was 5.69 lakh Metric Tonnes (MTs).

The area under paddy here was not as much in 1997 (1,86,000 hectares) while the average yield per acre was 2,796 kg/hectare and the total production was 5.13 lakh MTs.

It was evident, he said, from the data that the area under paddy had increased over the years, as had the production per hectare.

In case of maize, the area under cultivation in 1996-97 was 1,50,00 hectares,which fell to 1,30,00 hectares in 2000-2001. Farmers could shift to maize cultivation as an alternative to paddy.

This, Kahlon said, would be difficult since the maize prices were unstable, the crop was vulnerable to bird attacks and it did not have a high yield per hectare.

Another favourite with the farmers is sugarcane. Despite the complaints of late payments by sugarmills, the area under sugarcane production was 1,80,00 hectares in 2000-2001.

6,Shelter at last for riot widows,"AHMEDABAD: On Friday, 37 widows and their children from the Dariakhan and Vatwa relief camps found a permanent special home at Juhapura, courtesy the Gujarat Musturat Sewa Trust, which has adopted these people.

Trust president Mehrunisaa Mansuri says, ""the riots have widowed many and the trust has taken the responsibility of providing them with a permanent shelter and to educate their children"". Soon the trust will help women to become financially independent by training them in sewing, handicrafts, making jams, jellies or pickles.

For most of these women it is a welcome change. From the hot and crowded camps they have come to a haven. Bano Hussain, who was at Dariakhan camp says ""This is a blessing. My children will receive education and I will start my life afresh.""

Most of these women have been through hell and back. Ferdoz Jahan, who lost her husband in the Gulbarg society massacre, says, ""Mohammed thought he was safe at Ehsan Jaffri''s (ex-MP who too was killed) place. He had sent me to my mother''s place and taken shelter there.""

Hamida, Ameera, Shabana and Shama have all lost their husbands. After the ibaadat (mourning) they will shift to the shelter. Rasita Saruddin was busy preparing the wedding dress for her niece on February 28 when the mobs struck. She says, ""I managed to escape but they burnt and looted my house. All the dresses, jewellery and the money is gone. If it were not for this trust I would not look forward to life.""

Hamida Sheikh from the Vatwa camp wants to earn her own bread. She says, ""I am going to learn how to sew. From what I sell, I will receive 80 per cent of the profits.""

For most of the children, living in the shelter means that their education is ensured. Twelve-year old Moshin wants a decent education. He says, ""I will study very hard and become a CBI officer."" Ask him why and he says, ""My mother says if I become a CBI officer I can catch all the mobs who burnt and destroyed my home"".

13,Citu demands reversal of govt decision on IPCL,"NEW DELHI: Centre of Indian Trade Unions on Sunday demanded a reversal of government''s decision to sell 26 per cent stake of Indian Petrochemical Corporation to Reliance Industries saying the move would have ""adverse impact"" on the market.

""By grabbing the IPCL, RIL will establish its domination in the petrochemical sector in the country with monopoly in many petrochemical products which will obviously have adverse impact in the market,"" Citu said in a statement here on Sunday.

Describing the sell-out as ""criminal indifference"" to the welfare of the people and the country by the BJP-led NDA government, it said, the financial loss to the national exchequer on several accounts due to this ""suicidal deal"" by the Vajpayee government was huge.

NDA government has accepted the ''discounted cash flow'' method under which price was fixed without any consideration of the huge asset base of the company which obviously would help RIL at the cost of public money,"" the statement said.

Citu pointed out that during the fiscal 2000-01, IPCL had earned a profit of Rs 248.95 crore after tax. Further, at the time of privatisation, the company had Rs 2,946.13 crore as reserve and surplus.
