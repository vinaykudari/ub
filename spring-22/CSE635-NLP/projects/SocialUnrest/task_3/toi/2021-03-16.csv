0,Bindaas beats to jive up elections,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: It may well be â€˜M bole to Modiâ€™ and â€˜B bole to BJPâ€™ when the saffron party tries to reach out to the voters this elections. Though the actual campaign is yet to start, fine-tuning of the vocal chords and turning of popular songs into parodies has already begun.

Bollywood numbers are being plagiarised to add some colour to the campaign. â€˜Munnabhai MBBSâ€™ must have been mixed and remixed a dozen times. The BJP plans to latch onto not only Hindi film songs but also â€˜garbasâ€™ and title songs of popular teleserials. So donâ€™t be surprised with a parody which goes like this... â€˜Kyunki Sonia bhi kabhi Italian thi...â€™

""One cassette, which has 14 garbas praising the achievements of the BJP governments at the Centre and state, will be vital to the campaign,"" says Kardam Dave, who handles audio cassettes in the BJPâ€™s media cell. Songs like â€˜Idhar chala mein udhar chalaâ€™ from Hrithik Roshanstarrer â€˜Koi Mil Gayaâ€™, the title track from â€˜Munnabhai MBBSâ€™ and â€˜Na tum jano na humâ€™ are hot favourites for tunes.

Himanshu Vyas of the Congress media cell has big plans as far as using visual media is concerned. ""We will shoot a documentary highlighting the failures of the BJP as well as the NDA and take it to the people,"" says Vyas.

Musician Naynesh Jani,who is busy supervising election albums, says selection of the songs is the key. ""Mostly itâ€™s film song parodies that click the most with voters.We ensure that the quality of recording is such that it can be played on all types of systems,"" says Jani,who says his albums will be out in another 10 daysâ€™ time.

Jaykar Bhojak, who has provided such albums in the last election, says speed is the key in this profession because there is very little time to actually record the albums. The pressure really mounts once the candidates fill up the forms. ""In the past, I have churned out four albums in as many days,"" he says.

According to sources in the music industry, the political parties shell out anything between Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh to get each cassette prepared. The BJP in Vadodara has roped in partyman Jignesh Joshi to make the albums. ""The exact content is yet to be decided, but we have drawn up a list of songs. Some songs have been recorded in Delhi and we plan to do some recording locally too,"" Joshi said. He added that the cassette would include both original compositions as well as parodies. ""About 60 per cent of the songs will be based on hit movie tunes while the remaining will be original songs,"" Joshi said.

""We have invited quotations from artistes in Rajkot and Vadodara. We are yet to evolve a theme for the campaign,"" informs AICC secretary Satyajit Gaekwad.

1,Identify riot witnesses for central protection: SC,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to identify key witnesses in the nine Gujarat riot cases, trials in which have been stayed on its orders, for the purpose of making arrangements for their security by central police forces like the CRPF.

The order was passed by a Bench comprising Chief Justice VN Khare, Justices SB Sinha and SH Kapadia on a petition filed by Citizens for Justice and Peace which recounted the fear of insecurity among the witnesses.

Responding to the earlier order of the court exhorting the Centre to come forward to extend security, solicitorgeneral Kirit Raval submitted that there were 1,499 witnesses in the nine riot cases and it would be impossible for central forces to provide security to all.

Gujarat government counsel additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi pointed out that security had been given to most of the witnesses. Reiterating that the Centre was not averse to providing security through central forces, he sought three weeksâ€™ time.

However, the court asked him to report by April 2.

2,Auctions to coincide with Metro arrival,"NEW DELHI: Call it a good marketing strategy or simple logic. Either way, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is playing a win-win game.

Taking advantage of the Metro, DDA has strategically planned a number of auctions of residential plots, nursing home sites and even the twin district centres in Rohini to coincide with the Metro rail reaching the area.

According to the DDA, this approach will bring in more revenue. The Metro''s last section between Tri Nagar and Rithala will become operational on March 31.

About the same time, there will be a number of back-to-back auctions. On March 27, a number of prime residential plots of Rohini will be auctioned.

These would include plots in pocket 6 of Sector 16, pockets 5 and 28 of Sector 24, pocket 9 of Sector 23 and pocket 2 of Sector 21.

March 29 will see three nursing home sites in Rohini being auctioned off â€” one in Sector 8 and two in Sector 18. Some more residential plots of Rohini will be auctioned off at 2 pm on March 29. These plots are in pocket 6 of Sector 16 and pocket 2 of Sector 11.

One of the mega-auctions will be of plots at the twin district centres in Rohini. Marked as District Centre I and II, the two complexes are separated by the Swarn Jayanti Park. Each covers an area of 33 hectares. The park itself covers 100 hectares.

A senior DDA official said: ""No date has been finalised for the auction of the plots in these district centres. But we are trying to dispose them of by about March or early April. The Metro will reach Rohini by then and better connectivity of an area helps in increasing the real estate prices there.""

4,Metro denies flouting rules,"BANGALORE: Metro Cash & Carry has refuted charges of Swadeshi Jagran Manch that they were selling beef or cow meat against the law.

5,No threat to govt: Mulayam,"FAIZABAD: Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday ruled out fall of his government if Congress withdrew support but said such a move would help Bharatiya Janata Party. Addressing an election rally here, Yadav said his government enjoyed comfortable majority and faced no threat in case of withdrawal of support as threatened by some Congress leaders.

Stressing that his coalition government would complete its full term, Yadav urged Congress president Sonia Gandhi not to give opportunity to communal forces to form a government.

He asked Gandhi to use her ""good offices to strengthen secular forces to keep BJP at bay"" in the Lok Sabha elections. The chief minister said that he had resisted the suggestion for dissolution of the state assembly to pave way for simultaneous assembly elections along with the Lok Sabha polls as it would have caused huge financial burden to the state exchequer.

SP list soon: Stating that the Samajwadi Party would release the list of its candidates very soon, state general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav maintained that the party would field its candidate from Lucknow parliamentary constituency. He also did not preclude the possibility of SP president Mulayam Singh Yadav contesting the polls while simultaneously maintaining that Kalyan Singh would have a tough time in Bulandshahar.

Addressing a press conference in Lucknow, Yadav dismissed Kalyan Singh''s observation that his presence would jeopardise the SP''s poll prospects in western UP. He said that BJP leader himself would find it tough to win the seat.

6,Arrested CBI lawyer granted bail,"LUCKNOW: Over a hundred lawyers collected at the court room of the special CBI judge LB Upadhyay raising slogans in defence of their colleague Sirish Chandra Agnihotri, who was arrested by the CBI from his Ashiyana residence late on Sunday night, on charges of corruption, alongwith a CBI constable.

Though the lawyer was granted bail, the CBI constable was jailed. A special team from the anticorruption unit of CBI Delhi swooped down on the Ashiyana colony residence of Sirish Chandra Agnihotri and arrested him on charges of accepting Rs 25,000 as part-payment for a Rs 1 lakh deal to get the name of his former client OP Lakhina removed from the CBI chargesheet filed against the latter, in connection with a case registered in Varanasi in 2002, in connection with the UTI scam. Lakhina was the branch manager of UTI in Varanasi at the time of the scam, and was chargesheeted. He hired the services of advocate Sirish Chandra Agnihotri â€” a known defence lawyer of CBI cases.

CBI sources said that Lakhina has about four months back, washed his hands off Agnihotri, and hired one Mukul Joshi to fight his case in court. Thereafter, Agnihotri allegedly sent feelers to Lakhina stating that he could ''manage'' the removal of his name from the CBI chargesheet, but at a cost of Rs 1 lakh. This information was allegedly passed on to Lakhina by Sanjay Singh, a Punjab Police constable currently on CBI deputation, and posted with the Lucknow unit of the CBI''s anticorruption wing.

Fearing a trap, Lakhina approached the Delhi headquarters of the CBI and lodged a complaint, following which, after sustained surveillance, Agnihotri was arrested minutes after Rs 25,000 was delivered to him at his house as part-payment for the deal, which he had offered Lakhina. Later, the CBI also arrested constable Sanjay Singh.

On Monday, both Agnihotri and Sanjay Singh were produced before the special CBI judge LB Upadhyay for further legal action to be taken.

The two arrived at a jam-packed court room of the special CBI judge at around 3:15 pm, as hundreds of lawyers donning black coats thronged the premises. As the two were escorted to the courtroom, the lawyers forced the mediapersons out of the room after one of them shouted: ""Jo wakeel ya CBI se na ho, woh bahar chala jaye"" (Those who are neither lawyers nor from the CBI may leave the courtroom).

When some mediapersons ignored the warning, they were pushed out of the courtroom, which was by then under siege by the ''men in black''. A photojournalist trying to shoot a few frames of the chaotic situation almost had his camera snatched away, forcing him to beat a hasty retreat.

Ironically, the special CBI judge LB Upadhyay reportedly left his courtroom seat twice and walked into his chamber for minutes at a stretch, apparently because of the chaos in the courtroom. The lawyers however, refused to budge.

Finally, Agnihotri was granted bail by the CBI special judge, while the CBI constable Sanjay Singh was remanded to judicial custody. Interestingly, the CBI had arrested Agnihotri for accepting Rs 25,000 as a bribe, while on the other hand, the CBI constable Sanjay was merely acting as the intermediary.

7,State govt to unveil makeover plan for city,"MUMBAI: Mumbai''s much needed makeover is around the corner, if the powers that be are to be believed.

Governor Mohammed Fazal, while addressing a joint sitting of the two houses of the state legislature on Monday, revealed the government''s plans in this regard.

The joint sitting marked the opening day of the three-day vote-on-account session.

Fazal said that the government, in collaboration with the BMC, city police and railways, planned to unveil a slew of schemes such as the expansion of Chhatrapati Shivaji terminus, upgradation of the city''s road network and beautification of Marine Drive.

In a bid to accelerate Mumbai''s planned development, the state government has sought assistance from the Union government.

Claiming that Maharashtra continued to retain its position as the premiere industrial state in the country, Mr Fazal said that during the period from January 2003 to October in the same year, the state had received more than 1.100 investment proposals to the tune of Rs 4,400 crore, while FDI proposals from over 250 investors, involving an investment of Rs 600 crore, were in the bag.

8,Sena woos North Indians as polls near,"MUMBAI: After having led aggressive campaigns against North Indians in the recent months, the Shiv Sena is now wooing them through the ''Mee Mumbaikar'' programme, which emphasises on citizens'' ties with Mumbai and its ethos, and dilutes the ""bhumiputra"" or sons of-the-soil theory considerably.

The Sena recently held meetings of the non-Marathi speaking people under the ''Mee Mumbaikar'' campaign in Bandra and Malad, having realised the adverse impact of the ''bhumiputra'' campaign on its electoral prospects, since northIndians form a sizeable part of the city electorate.

Sena is filing nominations in three of the six Lok Sabha seats inMumbai, and fear that the anti- north Indian campaign might backfire in the Mumbai north-west constituency, where they plan to field their Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Nirupam against Congress MP Sunil Dutt.

The constituency has a sizeable migrant population from UP and Bihar, unlike the other two constituencies of Mumbai south- central and Mumbai north-central. The remaining three seats are being contested by the BJP.

The drive against North Indians has caused enormous embarrassment to Nirupam and in private many north Indians criticise him for his inability to stop the hate campaign against migrants from UP and Bihar.

Incidentally, there is considerable resentment within the Sena regarding the proposed nomination of a ""non-Maharashtrian"" like Nirupam.

""Nirupam is already serving his second term as a Rajya Sabha MP. It is shocking to note that the Sena is unable to find a Maharashtrian who can take on Sunil Dutt,"" a Sena activist observed.

Sena watchers said that the ''Mee Mumbaikar'' programme was the brainchild of their executive president Uddhav Thackeray, but it lost steam mid-way.

However, another faction within the Sena is trying to implement the ""bhumiputra"" theory with a vengeance to embarrass the junior Thackeray who is likely to become chief minister if the saffron alliance captures power during the assembly elections scheduled to be held six months later.

In the past, Sena activists had chanted slogans like ""Verma, Sharma chale jao"" and even beaten up north Indian candidates during the railway recruitment drive.

More recently, party leader Ramkrishna Keni launched a campaign against north Indians in the fish trade business accusing them marginalising kolis, the traditional Maharashtrian fisherfolk.

""The result is that not one basket of fish being sold to north Indian fish traders in any of the docks in Mumbai by the wholesalers. In fact, Sena activists have beaten up a few north Indians who came to the docks Bhaucha Dhakka and Sassoon Dock to buy fish from the wholesalers,"" said Nasir Jamal of the Samajwadi Party, who is leading the deprived north Indian fish traders.

But now Uddhav, a pragmatist that he is, has realised that if the ""bhumiputra"" theory is pushed too far it could prove to be politically counter-productive and even harmful.

His supporters are then reviving the ''Mee Mumbaikar'' campaign in a new format as part of a damage-control exercise.

9,Medha plunges into political mainstream,"MUMBAI: Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar has decided to plunge into electoral politics to highlight her fight against the NDA government''s ambitious project of linking the major rivers in the country.

She is keen on contesting from the Rajapur Lok Sabha constituency in coastal Konkan from where former Union minister Suresh Prabhu (Shiv Sena) is seeking re-election.

Prabhu is in charge of the task force for formulating and implementing the mega river linking project.

While the left front is supporting Patkar''s candidature, Congress and the NCP are undecided about backing her.

Major (retd) Sudhir Sawant, who was defeated by Prabhu in the last polls, is also keen on contesting from this constituency. The NCP, which has an understanding with the Congress, will back the latter''s nominee.

However, should the Congress back Patkar, it is worried about the adverse fallout in Gujarat where Patkar has drawn fierce criticism because of her opposition to the Sardar Sarovar Project.

The central election committee of the Congress had shortlisted Major Sawant and Rajendra Desai, son of the late minister S N Desai, for the constituency.

With Patkar entering the fray, the Congress'' election committee has left it to party president Sonia Gandhi to decide on the activist''s candidature.

10,Proxy candidate arrested after blurting out 'truth',"KOLKATA: This 19-year-old was smart but not enough. Chandan Paswan, a Madhyamik candidate, fooled invigilators for eight days â€” impersonating his brother â€” only to falter on Monday, the last day of compulsory examinations. Perhaps he could have got off, had he kept quiet.

When invigilator Shankar Narayan Bandyopadhyay walked up to Chandan to check his admit card, the youth grew tense. The invigilator, he thought, was taking too long. To quash all suspicion, Chandan blurted out, ""I''m sure you are wondering about the changed hairstyle, Sir. I had a haircut recently.""

Bandyopadhyay was surprised. ""Why are you saying this?"" he asked, looking more carefully. Chandan kept mum.

Bandyopadhyay took him outside the examination hall and again checked the admit card. The photograph was indeed different. ""The teacher brought the candidate to me. He confessed he was appearing on behalf of his brother Ranjit.

He had done this in the previous papers, too. I conveyed this to the board and on instructions informed the Watgunj police station,"" Kidderpore Academy headmaster Kamaleshwar Gupta said.

Watgunj officer-in-charge Chanchal Sakar said Chandan had been arrested. ""He is a Madhyamik passout. However, he could not tell us convincingly why he had been doing this. Sometimes he says his brother is too scared, at times he claims he is working,"" said Sarkar.

According to police, the Paswan brothers hail from an economically backward family at Bhukailash Road. Ranjit was a student of Gyan Bhaskar Vidyalaya. All the papers â€”Hindi I and II, English, geography, history, physical science and life science â€” the candidate had appeared in would stand cancelled.

11,3 arrested in conference call scam,"PUNE: In a significant breakthrough, the Pune police have arrested three persons, including a Dubai-based NRI, in connection with the international call racket on Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited''s (BSNL) mobile service, CellOne.

While the NRI, Ratan alias Chakrapani Annam (42), was arrested in Mumbai on Saturday, the other two - Shyam Annam (26) of Mumbai and Iyas Sheikh alias Raju alias Sandip Patil (26) of Hyderabad - were held on Sunday.

On Monday, a city court remanded them to police custody till March 22.

In an exclusive report, The Times of India had, on February 18, exposed the scam (''International call scam bleeds BSNL''), following the detection of unpaid CellOne bills running into a few lakhs.

The bills reflected heavy traffic, mainly between Gulf countries, such as Saudi Arabia, and Kerala, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Solapur.

The huge bills were never settled by the scamsters, who had obtained the connections by submitting fictitious names and addresses or forged documents of unsuspecting citizens.

The police estimate the size of the fraud at Rs 41.30 lakh and smell a bigger racket of inter-state ramifications as the trio had taught the modus operandi to many others.

Inspector Vasant Tambay told TNN that following a complaint by BSNL, Pune, at the Khadak police station, the police started taking detailed print-outs of unpaid bills and interrogated the persons, whose numbers figured on them.

This led to the arrest of Annam and his cousin, Shyam. The police have recovered a car, nine mobile phones, fake credit cards, pan cards and other documents worth Rs 3.85 lakh from the three.

12,"SPG between Rahul, Priyanka and polls","NEW DELHI: The Gandhi Juniors, Priyanka and Rahul, are all set to help the Congress if the Special Protection Group (SPG), the elite security corps guarding them, gives its go-ahead.

The SPG is looking into the matter, taking into account the threat perception. If the plan is okayed by the SPG officials, the two will set out from early April on a tour of Uttar Pradesh and end it in Delhi.

Their proposed roadshow has been, in keeping with the party campaign''s populist theme to swear by the aam aadmi, styled ""Janata Yatra"".

Though not billed to be an exercise of the same scale as Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s trendsetting yatra this poll season, Congressmen in UP are anxiously looking forward to the roadshow, hoping that it would breathe life into the organisation, which se ems to lack youth appeal.

The initial plans were to take the roadshow to all the 80 constituencies in UP, but there is a possibility of bringing the number down to 40 in the state and include Delhi in it.

Interestingly, the vehicle which was being readied for the yatra, is also a Swaraj Mazda, like the one which is being used for the Bharat Uday Yatra, fitted with laptop, satellite phone, conference room, chemical toilet and a hydraulic lift dais.

But security being a major concern, the organisers are considering using an SUV now.

The Spainish law prohibits any access to an accused for 72 hours, sources in the Home Ministry said.
