1,Concern at HC asking CM about striking lawyers,"PATNA: The convenor of the coordination committee of the three associations of lawyers of Patna High court, Yogesh Chandra Verma, here on Saturday expressed concern at the High Court asking the chief minister whether the government lawyers not appearing in Chief Justiceâ€™s court were on strike.

In a statement, Verma said that this amounted to breaking the unity of the lawyers who were not discharging their professional duties in CJâ€™s court on the call of the coordination committee.

It may be recounted that the coordination committee had given the call to lawyers to refrain from doing professional duties in the court of the Chief Justice, R S Dhavan, â€œas he had made adverse remarks against the lawyers in one of his orders delivered in the courtâ€�. Verma said that the Chief Justice had issued directive to the chief minister in such a light â€œinstead of holding a dialogue with the coordination committee to end the deadlock created due to his making a general remark on the lawyers as a communityâ€�.

â€œThe adverse remark of the Chief Justice goes against 70,000 lawyers of the stateâ€�, Verma claimed.

He said that the Chief Justice should have gone for maintaining good relationship between the bar and the bench. He added that the lawyers of the High Court had always cooperated in disposal of cases and supported wholeheartedly the special courts for speedy disposal of cases.

On the other hand, the former vice president of Advocatesâ€™ Association of Patna High Court, Radhe Shyam Gupta, in a statement, appealed to the advocate general, Bihar, and ad-hoc chairman of Bihar State Bar Council, Shashi Anugrah Narain, to assist in judicial functions of the Chief Justiceâ€™s court or resign from the posts.

He added that Narainâ€™s resignation from the post of advocate general was important because if he does not assist in judicial functions in the Chief Justiceâ€™s court, some other person should join his post to shoulder the responsibility and duty of assisting in judicial functions in the Chief Justiceâ€™s court.

2,Sena leader among 8 held for violence,"PUNE: The Khadak police on Saturday arrested eight people, including former Shiv Sena corporator Rajan Kachi, for assaulting a 23-year-old youth and his family members with sharp weapons.

According to the police, Kachi and his men nursed a grudge against the youth, Ganesh Keshav Wadekar, ever since he registered the Ashtavinayak Ganesh mandal in Shukrawar Peth, Kachiâ€™s stronghold. Kachi was also peeved with the Wadekars because Ganeshâ€™s father contested the municipal poll, held earlier this year, against him.

According to the police, Kachi picked up an argument with Ganesh on Friday night. This led to a heated exchange of words. Kachi, and his men beat up Ganesh, as well as his brother and uncle Sohan, injuring them with sharp weapons in the process.

Among those arrested are Milind Kachi (30), Uttam Dhamale (40), Raju Kadam 40), Pawan Kachi (21), Sagar Kachi (21), Pritam Kachi (21) and Hemant Kachi (29).

3,"J&K polls enter last round, Omar upbeat","RAMBAN, Doda: As the campaigning for the fourth and last round of Assembly elections ended on Sunday, National Conference chief Omar Abdullah said his party would get the majority.He said his party was sure to get 50 seats in the 87-member Assembly and that would mean a clear majority.""I am sure we will get 50 seats, give or take two either way, and that means the NC will form the government again,"" Omar said on reaching here after a hectic day of campaigning in far-off areas of Marwah (in Kishtwar) and Bonjwah (Inderwal).He said parties like the Congress and the PDP would together get barely 20 seats and it would thus be curtains for them.The NC chief said that he had done the best he could and was very confident of results favouring his party, mainly because the Opposition parties like the Congress and the People''s Democratic Party (PDP) did not have any positive agenda for the state.The Opposition parties had done everything possible to harm the NC, but the voters would dump them and reject them outright at the hustings, Omar said.He said PDP leader Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and state Congress chief Ghulam Nabi Azad both lacked guts to fight the elections from their own hometowns, leave aside anywhere else. ""How can they claim that they are capable of leading the state and will form the next government?""The young NC chief said that Azad would go back to Delhi once the results were declared and Mufti would face a similar predicament. Union Minister of State for Defence and senior BJP leader Chaman Lal Gupta would have a tough time in Delhi before the top leadership of the party once his party is routed in the ongoing elections.Singling out Azad for special treatment, Omar said the Congress had dumped him and it was only due to the magnanimity of Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah that Azad''s political career was revived.Had it not been for the CM''s kindness in getting Azad elected to the Rajya Sabha, he (Azad) would have become a forgotten political figure by now, the NC chief added.The least Azad should have done was to have resigned from the Rajya Sabha before launching a campaign against the NC. For over 20 years, Azad had almost severed his contacts with Jammu and Kashmir preferring to live a luxurious life in Delhi, Omar said.Azad''s heart was still in Delhi and he would ditch the people of the state at the first available opportunity and go back to Delhi, he added.Omar was camping here for the past few days along with his family to campaign for the party''s candidates in the six constituencies of Doda district, which go to polls on October 8 in the fourth and last phase of polling.With this, Omar has completed campaigning in the Jammu province, which he criss-crossed on a private helicopter over the last 45 days.Related stories:","RAMBAN, Doda"

5,Nalco disinvestment clears one hurdle,"NEW DELHI: Clearing a major roadblock for the three-tier disinvestment in Nalco, the Disinvestment Ministry has obtained an in-principle approval from market regulators both in India and the US that sale of shares to public in both the markets as well as to the strategic buyer could be done together.

This virtually puts to rest speculations over the necessity for a gap between a domestic and overseas offering of government equity as well as stretagic sale for privatisation of Nalco, which has become a bone of contention in Orissa.

While the government is likely to start the due deligence exercise later this month, Disinvestment Ministry officials would also seek comments soon from over a dozen bidders on the draft transaction documents.

When contacted Disinvestment Secretary Pradeep Baijal said that the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Securities Exchange Commission of the US have given in-principle approval that domestic issue, ADR and strategic sale could be executed simultaneously.

He, however, did not give a specific date for going ahead with the proposed three-tier sale of equity in Nalco, although from available indications it appears likely that public issues would be brought out during the last quarter of 2002-03.

The strategic sale of equity could follow immediately the public issues, sources hinted.

6,Two injured in communal clash in Dabhoi,"VADODARA: Trouble erupted in the communally sensitive town of Dabhoi on Sunday afternoon after a mob attacked shops belonging to the majority community. The police fired seven rounds that left two persons injured.

According to sources, trouble began in the town after a group from the minority community went to make a representation before the authorities regarding reconstruction of a ''dargah'' that was damaged during the recent communal riots. While the delegation was holding a meeting with the sub-divisional magistrate, another group of youngsters from the same community attempted to commence its reconstruction.

""The leaders had been denied permission to construct the religious structure as it was found that it was on government land. At the same time, it was decided that the issue would be discussed and sorted out after the Navratri festivities got over,"" said superintendent of police Piyush Patel.

However, sources said a group of youngsters began construction of the structure even as the meeting was in progress. Police rushed to the spot and brought the situation in control. Later, a mob reached the spot and demanded that it be allowed to reconstruct the building.

At this stage, the police had to resort to a lathi-charge to bring the situation under control. Repeated attempts at maintaining calm by those making the representation for reconstruction too fell on deaf ears.

In the meantime, a larger mob began collecting in the station area of the town. ""Around 1,000 to 1,200 persons had gathered in the locality as news of the trouble spread. Some members of the mob attacked two shops in the locality. The damaged establishments included that of a sweet vendor and a small cabin that repaired radio sets,"" Patel, who had rushed to the spot, said.

With the situation threatening to spiral out of control, the police fired seven rounds and lobbed around five tear-gas shells to control the violence. Two persons were injured in the firing. Police officials said that a bullet hit one in the leg while another suffered a minor bullet wound on the arm. One policeman was injured in stone-pelting by the mob.

Patel said two persons were arrested after the trouble was quelled. ""We have also got the names of several others involved in the disturbance. More arrests will take place soon,"" he said.

7,Modi govt completes one year in power,"AHMEDABAD: The BJP government headed by Chief Minister Narendra Modi has completed one year, during which it has expedited work on the ambitious Narmada project, as a result of which Narmada waters reached 1400 villages and 34 cities across the state.

A government spokesman on Sunday claimed that the state administration had taken a series of progressive measures such as introduction of ''loan melas'' through which a sum of over Rs 280 crore was disbursed among the weaker sections.

Another major achievement of the government was a unique scheme of ''Samras'' village under which special cash assistance was given to 3,600 gram panchayats, where representatives of people were elected unanimously.

The government had also accorded priority to the rehabilitation of cities and towns, falling in earthquake-affected Kutch and other districts of Saurashtra. Modi and industries minister Suresh Mehta frequently visited Kutch to supervise the rehabilitation works.

On the health front, the state government implemented several new schemes; it conducted a health check-up of 83 lakh students of primary schools. The state government absorbed almost all those who had cleared PTC examinations in primary schools.

8,Centre must have a clear J&K policy,"NEW DELHI: By the end of the week, the elections to the Jammu and Kashmir assembly will be over. Predicting outcomes is hazardous, but the free and fair elections have already yielded an important dividend â€” the emergence of a second force in the form of Mehbooba Muftiâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Peopleâ€™s Conference rebels.

Whether the outcome is a hung assembly or a narrow victory, it is apparent that the days of the National Conference hegemony in the stateâ€™s politics are over.

If the Vajpayee team thinks that the conduct of the elections and the 40 per cent plus turnout is the victory they were looking for, they will be mistaken. Significant chunks of the population boycotted the process â€” some out of fear, others from conviction that they will serve little purpose. One way or the other, their views have to be addressed through the process of dialogue.

There are also a large number of gunmen who are determined to have their way. Some like the Hizbul Mujahideen want to merge the state with Pakistan. There are other groups like the Jaish-e-Mohammed, Al Badr and Lashkar-e-Taiba whose fighters think they are following the diktat of religion, not aware that their leaders follow the Pakistani agenda. No political package or solution is likely to be acceptable to such elements. They have to be crushed or sent back where they came from. Diplomacy, beginning with a dialogue with Pakistan, could help here.

But the larger challenge may be in New Delhi. The Vajpayee government appears to be unclear as to what it wants in J&K and Pakistan. Some of this was reflected in its summary rejection of autonomy some years ago. More recently, this was seen in the confusion caused in the Sangh Parivar by the RSSâ€™ support for the trifurcation of the state against the stated position of the BJP.

Besides repeated declaration of war against terrorism, the Vajpayee government has not spelt out the manner in which it will deal with the persistent separatist sentiment in important sections of Kashmiri opinion, or with Pakistan which has so successfully employed these feelings to feed an armed insurgency in the state.

It is important for the government to come up with a clear policy outlining its goals in J&K and then move ahead to implement it. Off-the-cuff responses will not work and neither will the mere installation of an elected government in the state. In 1996, the Farooq government was handed a state where militancy was down to a minimal, but within two-three years, this advantage had been frittered away by the lack of movement on other goals â€” dialogue with the separatists and Pakistan.

The elections have provided a good measure of what the people of the state want; it is up to Vajpayee and his government to tailor a suitable dress.

9,Campaigning ends for last phase in J&K polls,"SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Peppered with an abortive bid on the life of an Independent candidate and an ambush on an Army vehicle, killing two jawans, campaigning for the last phase of polls in Jammu and Kashmir ended here on Sunday.

Six constituencies in militancy-hit Doda district and Lolab ( Kashmir valley) will go to the polls on October 8. Elections were countermanded here following the assassination of law minister Mushtaq Ahmad Lone.

Nearly 18,000 additional para-troopers have been deployed in the six assembly constituencies of Doda district in Jammu and Kashmir to ensure peaceful elections and to infuse confidence among the electorate.

Security forces have also been deployed at Pirpanjal ranges, touching Anantnag district, to prevent militants from sneaking into Doda.

Militants ambushed two Army vehicles, killing two Rashtriya Rifle personnel on-the-spot and injuring three others in Pangai village, Rajouri district, on Sunday afternoon, the police said. The vehicles were carrying patrol parties, on their way to Rajouri from Shahdra.

The security personnel retaliated and exchanged fire, the police said. Reinforcements have been rushed to the area to track down the militants.

Independent candidate Abdul Hafiz Wani escaped an attempt on his life, when militants opened fire from hilltops on his motorcade at Dosa-Pati in Doda district, while he was on way from Bhaderwah to address an election rally at Kensa this morning. No one was injured in the attack.

Security personnel were also targeted near Town Hall as militants lobbed a grenade at 11 am on Sunday. However, the grenade missed its target and exploded in a drain without causing any damage, sources said. The area was cordoned off immediately.

An artillery spat from Pakistan was experienced across the Line of Control and the International Border, promp-ting the Indian troops to retaliate. No loss of life was reported.

In other incidents of violence since Saturday, militants raided Kotdara village in Baramulla district. They gunned down two persons and wounded another suspecting them to be police informers.

Militants also detonated an improvised explosive device inside a block development office at Sogam, near Lolab, in the frontier district of Kupwara in the wee hours, damaging the building extensively, the police said.
