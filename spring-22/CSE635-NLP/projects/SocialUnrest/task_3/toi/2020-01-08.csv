1,Traders' protest loses steam,"LUCKNOW: The unrest in the trader community following the death of a Sriram Road jeweller Jasbir Singh at Aminabad police station, where he had been summoned by the officials for sorting out a dispute, appears to be over. With the relatives of Jasbir apparently disassociating themselves from the ongoing tradersâ€™ agitation, their protest lost steam on Tuesday.

What reflected the present stand of Jasbirâ€™s kin was his brotherâ€™s uttering to a trader leader during the cremation ceremony at Bhainsakund: â€œTum keh rahe the tum poora saath doge, lo ab mera bhai chita par leta hai ... jao saath doâ€� (You were claiming that you would be with him all along... now my brother is on the pyre ... do accompany him). Another member of the family, when being consoled by a friend, added that the politics of the trader leaders had finally cost them dear. Some prominent members of Sriram Road Vypar Mandal, of which Jasbir was the vice-president, also admitted that the issue was blown out of proportion at the behest of some â€˜professionalâ€™ trader leaders. â€œAfter the initial protest, we never wanted to continue with the demand of immediate removal of the inspector as the authorities had assured that action would be initiated against him on the basis of the inquiry,â€� divulged a trader of Sriram Road.

â€œBut, some trader leaders insisted that the agitation should go on as it was a matter of prestige now,â€� he added. The district authorities have been on their toes to handle the tradersâ€™ unrest, ignited â€” what now is being realised â€” by some trader leaders, who were basking in the media attention. However cracks have started surfacing among various wings involved in the agitation.

The office bearer of community body of the Sikhs along with those from the jeweller association though shared the dais with trader leaders at a press conference on Tuesday, later a section of them disassociated themselves. Now, with only one faction of the traders, particularly the leader of the faction, continuing with the agitation, it seems all but over.

2,Telgi case: Mumbai lawyer named special public prosecutor,"PUNE: Noted criminal lawyer from Mumbai, Raja Thakare, has been appointed special public prosecutor in the Rs 2,200-crore fake stamp paper racket.

However, the move has irked local public prosecutors. An application of 23 accused other than the kingpin of the racket, Abdul Karim Telgi, came up for hearing before designated judge for Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) trials, M.G. Gaikwad.

During the hearing, Thakare appeared and produced documents stating that he had been appointed special public prosecutor in the case. He said he would like to study the case in detail and requested Gaikwad to postpone the hearing on the bail plea. Accepting his request, Gaikwad deferred the hearing till January 18. However, the governmentâ€™s move to appoint a special public prosecutor has irked local public prosecutors.

Speaking to TNN, a senior public prosecutor said on the condition of anonymity, â€œEver since the scam was unearthed, we have been working closely with the Pune police and the Special Task Force (STF) and successfully pleaded the prosecutionâ€™s case before the court. We also ensured that the accused are not released on bail. By appointing a special prosecutor, the government is trying to prove that it doesnâ€™t have faith in our ability.â€� He alleged that in all high-profile cases, like the Nita Hendre murder case, Rathi murder case, tennis player R.

3,No tampering with development plan: CM,"PUNE: The move by the ruling Congress party in the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) to carry out 100 amendments to the draft development plan (DP) of the 23 fringe villages was grounded by none other than chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, who asserted on Tuesday that he would not tolerate any attempts to â€œpush through a DP which goes against the interests of Pune cityâ€�.

â€œTill I am chief minister of Maharashtra, I will see to it that the DP for the 23 fringe villages in Pune is environment-friendly and ensures justice to the farmers,â€� Deshmukh said while addressing a function organised by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) in Hadapsar to launch the construction of a flyover on the Pune-Solapur highway.

Deshmukh pointed out that even if the civic general body carried out any modifications in the draft DP, it was not the final authority. The DP will become law only after it is ratified by the state urban development ministry, which is headed by Deshmukh himself! During the public meeting, the chief minister announced that the state was seriously considering the abolition of the Urban Land Ceiling Act and had appointed a committee to prepare report in this regard.

4,Warring Samata Party factions rule out split,"PATNA: Warring factions of the Bihar unit of the Samata Party on Monday ruled out the possibility of a split in the party but stopped short of calling a truce.

Samata national general secretary Satish Kumar of the pro-Nitish Kumar faction, which has called a meeting of the state executive committee on January 19 despite it being declared unconstitutional by state Samata president Raghunath Jha, ruled out any chances of a split in a press conference.

State Samata legislature party leader Umashanker Singh also told reporters separately that there would be no split.

However, Satish Kumar, MLA, declared that the January 19 meeting called to discuss important organisational matters would take place at any cost as it had the sanction of railway minister Nitish Kumar.

Satish Kumar, who was also part of the NDA delegation that submitted a memorandum to the governor Vinod Chandra Pande, told reporters that the meeting would take place despite it being declared unconstituional by state party president, Raghunath Jha and national spokesman Shambhu Srivastava as it had the sanction of the undisputed leader of party, Nitish Kumar.

Kumar, who along with state vice-president Shyam Sunder Singh Dheeraj, had walked out of the NDA meeting here on January 2 chaired by the NDA convenor George Fernandes after lodging their protest over not inviting the railway minister, said any Samata leader showing disrespect to Nitish Kumar will have no place in the party.

When asked to comment on his sacking of the state spokesman P K Sinha, MLC, which had been declared null and void by the state president, Kumar said, ""I, being a national general secretary, am fully competent and justified in taking such a measure as Sinha is hand in glove with RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav"".

""After removing Sinha on January 2, I spoke to Nitishji and he justified my action,"" he said. Sinha, on the other hand, said he had been removed by ""fake"" leaders having no locus standi and claimed he continued to be the spokesman. Sinha claimed that since he had been appointed by national president George Fernandes, he alone was competent to remove him.

Samata legislature party leader Umashanker Singh, considered close to Fernandes, shared Sinhaâ€™s view and described the action against him as violative of the party constitution.

Singh also ruled out the possibility of a split in the party over the issue of convening the meeting of the state executive and said he would leave for New Delhi where he would apprise Fernandes of the developments in the state party.

5,"Group clash in Beur jail, many hurt","PATNA: About half a dozen inmates of the Beur central jail were injured in a group clash among the supporters of Abhisek murder case convict Siddhartha, son of noted paediatrician Utpalkant, and Vijay Mahto.

According to jail sources, some of the injured received dagger wounds in ward number 4. But when contacted, IG, prisons, Ravikant said that it was a minor clash between the two rival groups of Siddharth and Mahto, in which 5-6 inmates received minor injuries. The injured were treated at the jail hospital and discharged. He also claimed that the jail administration itself brought the situation under control and restored normalcy inside the jail without the help of the district administration.

When asked when Siddharth, who had been transferred to Bhagalpur central jail from Beur jail, was brought back and for what purpose, Ravikant said that he had come here in connection with the hearing of the murder case in which he has been awarded life imprisonment. New jail superintendent Balmohan Naik has not yet taken charge of the Beur jail from Mahendra Kumar Bharti, whose services have been returned to his parent body, said minister of state for jail Ashok Chaudhary.

Naik is likely to take charge in a couple of days. The minister said that he would personally visit the Beur jail on Wednesday to study the situation there. Beur jail, in the recent past, has witnessed several clashes between groups of inmates. Wardens of the jail state that overcrowding and shortage of staff are the main reasons for the recurring problems faced by the jail authorities.

6,SAD (B) to miss all-party meet on SYL canal,"ALAMGIR, Ludhiana: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, on Tuesday announced that his party would boycott the all-party meet on Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue being convened by the Punjab government at Chandigarh on Wednesday.

Instead his party would launch a morcha on the issue, as the Congress party was the main culprit in delaying the resolution of the contentious issue till now, he said.

Nothing worthwhile could be expected from the Congress-led state government, but his party was committed to not sharing Punjab river water at any cost, Badal asserted, reiterating that the only solution to the nagging problem lay in referring to the Riparian Laws.

After deliberating over the contentious issue during the threehour political affairs committee (PAC) meeting held at Gurdwara Manji Sahib here, Badal told news persons that they had decided on a boycott, as the meet was just a cover-up for the failure of the Congress-led state government to resolve the issue. What has this government been doing for the whole year since the SC order, when chief minister Amarinder Singh has been telling the people of Punjab for long about filing a petition in the apex court against its ruling last year.

Lashing out at the Congress, Badal rued that the party had never been sincere regarding the interests of Punjab. For instance, he claimed to have received invitation for the proposed all-party meet at his Chandigarh residence at 12 noon on Tuesday.

If the government was sincere it should have discussed the matter with him as the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly.

At least the invitation letter should have been sent in advance, Badal said. Even Tuesdayâ€™s meeting was held on basis of media reports.

When asked about his partyâ€™s stand post-boycott, Badal said they would launch a morcha. But he declined to spell out its details.

Badal, however, reiterated that the decision was taken in view of the anti-Punjab stand of the Congress party over the issue right from the days of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

Tracing the origin of the watersharing issue, Badal reiterated that when Akali leaders and workers were in the prison during imposition of Emergency in 1975, the then PM Indira Gandhi had announced the decision to dig up SYL.

However, PM was not authorised to announce such award; only a tribunal was empowered to take decision, he said. Later, the then Punjab chief minister Darbara Singh withdrew the case from the SC in December 1981 under pressure from the then PM Indira Gandhi, he said.

Badal also referred to the statement of Punjab Congress affairs in charge Moti Lal Vora in January last year regarding the SC decision on SYL being binding on everyone.

8,Mayor threatens pay cut for bandh supporters,"KOLKATA: The mayor of Kolkata can be trusted to put his foot down against any activity which brings the city to a halt.

On Wednesday, Subrata Mukherjee threatened Kolkata Municipal Corporation employees with pay cut if they do not report for duty on Friday when the Party for Democratic Socialism calls a 12-hour Bangla bandh. The mayor has taken an anti-bandh stance despite his own party the Trinamul Congress supporting it.

Mukherjee, who had openly expressed his support for the state government''s decision to impose water tax- one of the main issues against which the bandh has been called -- said the KMC would remain open on Friday. ""I will go to office and I expect the employees to do the same. Any one refusing to come to office would have to accept pay cut,"" Mukherjee told newspersons. The state unit of the BJP, planning to form an electoral alliance with the Trinamul Congress, has decided to oppose the bandh. ""The issues do not call for an extreme step such as a bandh, Such a step should be taken only as a last resort. The situation is not such that a bandh will have to be called,"" BJP state president Tathgata Roy said. He said his party would also oppose the SUCI sponsored bandh.

A jittery SUCI, which had already called a 24-hour bandh on January 29, asked the people to foil the PDS-sponsored bandh. ""We had been the first to call a bandh. The PDS, with the help of the Trinamul, called the bandh later. They did so, only to disrupt our bandh which is the culmination of a threemonth-long struggle. We urge the people to oppose Friday''s bandh,"" said SUCI leader Shankar Saha. The PDS, however, expected that the people would support Friday''s bandh and would not respond to the SUCI- sponsored bandh. ""The people do not like so many bandhs,"" Saifuddin Choudhury said.

9,Disinvestment panel recommends sale of 4 PSUs,"NEW DELHI: The Disinvestment Commission has recommended privatisation of four PSUs including National Buildings Construction and Cotton Corporation.

In a report submitted to government recently, the commission suggested sale of 74 per cent stake of its 100 per cent shareholding in NBCC to strategic partner while retaining 26 per cent for three years.

The commission has also recommended disinvestment in Indian Medicines Pharmaceuticals (IMPCL) and Jute Corporation of India (JCL).

It has also said that an appropriate financial and organisational restructuring package should be formulated for the company after consultation with bidders.

The commission noted that there was no rationale for the government to continue in the company as there were no social benefits accruing from future association due to existence of employment opportunities.

It further said that there were no strategic reasons for continuation nor was government presence necessitated owing to monopoly considerations on account of presence of adequate number of players in the market.

NBCC has a equity base of Rs 120 crore and employs around 3150 employees.

In the case of Cotton Corporation (CCI) where government holds 100 per cent stake, it said that disinvestment would be conditioned by whether government decides to retain minimum support price (MSP) for cotton.

It said that in case government chose to retain MSP then strategic sale of 51 per cent stake would be appropriate while holding onto remaining 49 per cent for a period of three years.

In its 16th report, the commission further suggested government continuance in CCI for three years in case of failure to locate a suitable partner till new system of MSP operations stabilise and is accepted by players.

In case MSP is retained, competitive bidding process should be introduced to cut losses with government confining itself to announcement of MSP pronouncements.

During this period the company should participate in the bidding process for MSP and carry on commercial operations after which disinvestment can be taken up.

Alternatively, if the MSP operations were discontinued then government should sell all its equity to strategic partner.

In the case of Indian Medicines Pharmaceutical (IMPCL) set up to produce Ayurvedic and Unani medicines, the commission suggested two alternatives involving sale of its entire 51 per cent equity holding.

It said the government should first attempt sale of equity to its 49 per cent joint venture partner Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KVMNL) through a negotiated deal failing which it could offload its stake to a strategic partner.

The commission felt that the sale and offtake of medicines for a period of two years after disinvestment was needed to ensure smooth transition.

Pointing to the poor quality standards adopted by the company, it noted, ""maintenance of surroundings and interiors leaves a lot to be desired. It is essential that hygenic conditions be maintained. Further environment allows roaming of rodents as well as pets"".

It went on to add that IMPCL had outlived its utility in the present form with small size of operations failing to justify government involvement and furthermore involvement is inconsistent in the absence of strategic objectives. The commission also suggested two options for Jute Corporation of India (JCI) involving retaining government ownership for five years in case MSP operations continued and thereafter offloading 51 per cent to strategic partner along with organisational restructuring.

However, if MSP were dismantled then government should sell its entire equity holding of 100 per cent to strategic partner with the alternate option of closing down the entity.

JCI has accumulated losses to the tune of Rs 105 crore on a paid up capital base of Rs 5 crore and employs 1640 people.

12,India a strategic partner: Japanese minister,"NEW DELHI: Visiting Japanese foreign minister Yoriko Kawaguchi on Wednesday clearly identified India as a strategic partner of Japan but made it clear that there were some differences, including Japan''s desire to see greater stability in the region through descalation of Indo-Pak tensions.

In a speech at Ficci, Kawaguchi said the defence cooperation that both India and Japan had with the US was a factor of peace and stability in Asia and the Pacific. India and Japan had already begun cooperating in the area of defence and now cooperation in the maintenance of the security of maritime traffic in the sea lanes across the Indian Ocean and of the Straits of Malacca deserved increased attention.

Kawaguchi, however, stated clearly that Japan continued to seek India''s signature on both the NPT and the CTBT and hoped the latter would come into force early.

While expressing concern over terrorism directed against India, Kawaguchi said: ``Improvement in India-Pakistan relations is vital for Japanese companies here to be able to conduct stable economic activities.'''' This would also make the Indian market more attractive for investors. Describing India''s decision to redeploy forces as courageous, she hoped that ``even more positive steps would be taken to lead to the early resumption of dialogue between India and Pakistan''''.

Kawaguchi, who called on the Prime Minister earlier, was told that dialogue with Pakistan could resume only after an end to cross-border terrorism. The PM said the international community, including Japan, should exert stronger pressure on Pakistan.

Japan, Kawaguchi said, continued to urge Pakistan to put an end to infiltration across the Line of Control. On North Korea, Kawaguchi said that Japan was very concerned and wanted North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme in a verifiable manner.

Kawaguchi also announced a $ 900-million package of credit under the ODA, a figure that makes the ODA assistance to India nearly on a par with that given to China.

While the Indian government was reacting an positive environment through its economic reform policy, she hoped India would reduce the remaining obstacles. Japanese sources said Kawaguchi had asked external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha to look into the issue of the unexpected changes in rules which created unpredictability in the business environment.

Depending on the steps towards economic collaboration with Asean, it would be possible to create an expansive pan-Asian economic area extending from east to South Asia, she said.
