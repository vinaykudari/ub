0,Ayurvedic medicine firms flay ‘hasty’ enforcement of law,"PUNE: The Maharashtra Ayurvedic Medicine Producing Tradersâ€™ (MAMPT) have decided to send a letter of protest to the Union health ministry against the immediate implementation of the Tschedule of the Goods Manufacturing Practices Act.

Speaking to reporters after MAMPT convention on Wednesday, Vaidya P.Y. Khadiwale, co-ordinator of the tradersâ€™ body, clarified that not all manufacturers were against the implementation of the Act.

They are seeking two yearsâ€™ time to get acquainted to new procedures under the Act, as well as for the flaws in the Act to be weeded out.

Under the Act, it will become mandatory for all manufacturers to have a 1,250 sq.m. of land for the production facility. The production process will also have to be standardised.

â€œThese are things not all manufacturers can afford at this juncture,â€� said Vaidya Khadiwale. â€œThe well-meaning quality control Act is only creating untimely hurdles for manufacturers,â€� he added.

Vaidya Khadiwale also expressed resentment of the fact that none of the 150 manufactures of ayurvedic medicines in the state were taken into confidence while framing the Act.

He also questioned the wisdom of implementing it in Maharashtra, when some of the states had rejected it.

Speaking at Wednesdayâ€™s convention Prataprao Pawar, managing editor of daily Sakal, urged ayurvedic traders to take the competition in their stride. Eminent computer expert Dr Vijay Bhatkar called for the preservation of old methods.

3,Brother-in-law held for Rohini double murder,"NEW DELHI: Two days after Neelam Kaler found her children dead at her Rohini residence, the police have arrested her son-in-law, Vinay Kumar, for the murders. Vinayâ€™s servant, Munnesh, has also been arrested.

Police said Vinay wanted to get rid of any heirs to the Kaler residence in sector-3 Rohini, and so had murdered the siblings Sarika (22) and Bharat (18). Vinay (28) is married to Neelam Kalerâ€™s eldest daughter Monica. He was living in same neighbourhood as the victims, the police said.

Vinay has reportedly confessed to having killed the victims to become Neelamâ€™s sole heir. Deputy commissioner of police northwest Sanjay Singh said: â€˜â€˜The house was ransacked to mislead the police, and make it seem like a robbery.â€™â€™ According to the police, Vinay had taken loans from several persons which he could not repay. He had reportedly taken money from Neelam as well. â€˜â€˜Vinay got married in June 1996. He was dealing in property then,â€™â€™ the police said. His business, however, did not flourish and was soon shut down. Vinayâ€™s family also owed about Rs 8 lakh.

As a result, they had to move to a smaller accommodation. Vinay later separated from his family to live in sector 3, Rohini. There he started a telephone booth while his brother opened a mobile repair shop in the same premises. The police said Vinay was interested in Neelam Kalerâ€™s property which he thought was a suitable for his business.

4,"Ignorant minister, red-faced officials","LUCKNOW: The home-grown theories of minister for forest Jaivir Singh has caused much dismay among the forest officials who have been planning various greening projects to make up for the depleting cover, specially after the division of UP, which has left 44 districts with less than 1 per cent of green area in the state.

The minister had on Tuesday regaled the opposition by his reply to a question that the government had neither any action plan nor funds to make up for the scanty forest cover in the state.

Obviously embarrassed by the ministerâ€™s ignorance, senior officials reeled off a long list of afforestation schemes sponsored by the World Bank, the Central and the state governments â€œwhich are doing moderately wellâ€�.

In fact, the total number of saplings targeted for plantation this year alone by the department, informed a senior official on Wednesday, was 5.54 crore... â€œtoo huge to be overlooked easilyâ€�.

And this, he added, was besides a string of notable local efforts being made in this direction. â€œIf only Singh had done his homework well he would have known about.â€�

The ministerâ€™s howler came as a jolt to the Aranya Bhawan, involved as it is in the efforts to bring under green cover the area lying disused - 7000 hectare of degraded forest land, 72 lakh hectare of farm bunds and 35 lakh hectare of usar, banjar and plateau land, according to another officer.

The minister had also swept aside the attempts made to give a boost to social forestry by the previous regime.

Former forest minister Rajdhari Singh had also declared a cash award of Rs 1 lakh to villagers to encourage them to develop green cover along canals and railway tracks and shot off letters to 56,000 village heads to seek their cooperation in this direction, even as former chief minister Rajnath Singh had urged the officials to take up â€˜Green UPâ€™ scheme with the same vigour as the pulse polio drive, recalled the officials.

In fact, sources in the department also drew attention to an ambitious project undertaken by the state foresters who had sought to tutor the new legislators on depleting forest cover.

Chief conservator of social forestry RS Shukla had told Times News Network in March that a list of 44 districts with forest cover below one per cent had been tabulated. The idea, the sources had claimed, was to request the MLAs in their areas to earmark a portion of their development funds towards afforestation.

â€œLooking at the ignorance of the minister, we may have missed his name in the mailing list,â€� quipped one of the officials on Wednesday.

5,MLA among 174 SP workers arrested,"GORAKHPUR: As many as 174 Samajwadi Party workers including the MLA from Mundera Sharda Devi, district president Gopal Yadav and in-charge of party affairs for Gorakhpur KP Yadav were arrested here on Wednesday from collectorate compound where they were demonstrating against the BJP MP Adityanath.

A piquant situation arose when Sharda Devi occupied the chair of city magistrate and behaved in an indecent way with him. Some party workers also tried to damage his official vehicle.

Police used mild force to get the the office vacated. The agitators were demanding the arrest of Adityanath under Pota for disturbing communal harmony in the district and damaging public property.

Talking to newspersons at the police lines, Yadav alleged that Gorakhnath temple is functioning as an extra-constitutional authority and the district officials work under the instructions of Adityanath. If any official dares to oppose him, he is shunted out.

Sharda Devi alleged that no women police personnel were present at thecollectorate compound during the demonstration and she was manhandled by police men.

She threatened to raise the issue of her manhandling in assembly and said demonstration would be organised in front of the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow to protest the rude behaviour of the district administration.

Yadav questioned that when the supporters of Adityanath burnt the bogies of a train, UPSRT buses and private vehicles during bandh on Monday, they were not arrested.

He alleged that Adityanath wanted to create Gujarat-like situation here for his political benefit. The Samajwadi Party would not allow to let it happen, he warned.

Meanwhile, the district magistrate M S V Rami Reddy was transferred. He has joined only last month.

6,50 Naxals arrested in Jehanabad,"JEHANABAD: The special drive launched against extremists in Jehanabad in the wake of recent intra-Naxalite killings has started yielding results.

Claiming this, Jehanabad SP K K Singh said at least 50 extremists, including hardcore activists of the PWG, the MCC, the CPI-ML and the Ranvir Sena, have been rounded up and a large cache of arms and ammunition, including looted police rifles, recovered from them.

He said CRPF, BMP and DAP personnel have been deployed in the combing operation. When asked to explain the reasons behind recurrent clashes, warring ultra outfits, the SP said no ideology, whatsoever, was now involved in these clashes.

The current war of attrition is guided more by hegemonistic tendencies than by any genuine concern for the poor. â€œIn most of the cases, itâ€™s the poor who are paying the price of the senseless violence unleashed by these outfits,â€� he said adding what was one a class war had degenerated into pure caste war. â€œThe caste composition of the MCC, PWG and Ranvir Sena is an open secret.â€�

However, as for as law and order steps were concerned, the SP stressed the need for better cooperation among the people, intelligence agencies and police forces, and called for a more sophisticated and coordinated approach to solve the problems especially in view of the new methods the naxalites were adopting.

On the expeditious disposal of cases, he said that he had directed the officers-in-charge of different police stations to submit final form of the case within stipulated period and the trial of chargesheeted cases be taken up on a priority basis with the cooperation of the courts concerned. â€œThe OCs have also been asked to take stern action against those who have jumped bails,â€� said the SP.

He, however, described the lack of pucca road in the rural areas as a major bottleneck in effecting policing in the district.

7,BJP raps govt for immolation bids,"PATNA: The state BJP has asked the Congress ministers to given an account of the lives lost in RJD-Congress regime in Bihar in immolation and taking poison by youths. BJPâ€™s state spokesperson Kiran Ghai, vice-president Vinod Narayan Jha and Giriraj Singh, MLC, in a joint press statement, issued here on Wednesday alleged that the Congress ministers in Rabri Devi government have â€˜soldâ€™ the lives, properties and prestige of the people of the state. The Congress, which used to spew venom against the NDA government, has preferred to keep mum in the affairs of Bihar, particularly on the suicide bid of Kamal, Chandan and Pawan, who sacrificed their lives in the present insensitive government.

â€œNow since the employees of the BSRTC and teachers have threatened to immolate themselves, the Congress should do self-introspection whether it should continue to be the part of the state government. It (Congress) is sensitive only when in opposition and becomes insensitive the moment it comes in powerâ€�, they said.

These leaders further stated that it is an established fact that the RJD government in Bihar is neither sensitive nor it has any morality left. But how many deaths the Congress will see in Bihar to be sensitive and disassociate itself from the RJD? The people of the state will never forgive it for its greed/hunger for power, they stated.

Pawan Gope tried to commit suicide by consuming poison following denial of permission to meet chief minister Rabri Devi for seeking job on compassionate grounds. Though there were conflicting reports about the exact place where he made the suicide bid, Pawan, who is undergoing treatment at PMCH, claimed he had tried to do so at the chief ministerâ€™s residence on Monday evening. After his father, a chowkidar, died, he applied for a job in January 2000 but in vain.

8,'Expose TDP misrule',"VIJAYAWADA: Senior leaders of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) have appealed to the party workers to expose the misrule of the Telugu Desam Party government and the way it has been heavily taxing them.

Addressing a meeting organised by the city Youth Congress Committee here on Wednesday, PCC president M Satyanarayana Rao, spokesman K Rosaiah, former MP P Upendra and other leaders alleged that never before in the history of AP were people taxed so heavily.

In the last seven years of Telugu Desam Party rule, the per capita income rose by only 63 per cent. The government is collecting Rs 8,200 crore in the form of sales tax while an income of Rs 3,500 crore is accrued from sale of liquor.

The employment potential in the state has dipped to 0.35 per cent and the state ranks 24th in the country in terms of employment generation, Rosaiah said.

The abnormal hike in property tax in urban areas, professional tax and imposition of user-charges in government hospitals were some other ways by which people were being heavily taxed by the government. There seemed to be no end to this as the state government was bent on imposing service charges and taxes in various other forms, Rosaiah said.

It is time for the Congress to expose the state government on these aspects.

â€œJust put the facts before the people and they will teach the Chandrababu Naidu regime a lesson in the next elections,â€� Rosaiah said.

Pradesh Congress Committee chief M Satyanarayana Rao stressed on the need for unity in the party. PCC secretary Malladi Vishnu presided over the meeting.

10,Naidu berates partymen over transfer call,"VIJAYAWADA: Taking a serious note of happenings at the city Telugu Desam Party meeting here on Monday, chief minister and party president Chandrababu Naidu is said to have strongly reprimanded his party men against making â€œunjust and unwarrantedâ€� demands.

The Vijayawada TDP leaders on Monday demanded that police commissioner N V Surendra Babu, VGTM-UDA vice-chairman J Suresh Babu and municipal commissioner Praveen Prakash be transferred from the city to safeguard the interests of the party.

Based on reports from different sources regarding the meeting, the chief minister is said to have sought an explanation over the issue from ministers K Vijayarama Rao and Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao who were present at the meeting.

The TDP chief reportedly took exception to the city party leadersâ€™ stand and ordered that the party leaders desist from demanding replacement of officials.

Of late, TDP leaders in different districts have been trying to bring pressure on the government for replacement of IAS and IPS officers who were not heeding to their demands.

Last month, TDP leaders from Guntur district had to face the chief ministerâ€™s wrath for demanding the transfer of district superintendent of police P S R Anjaneyulu.

The chief minister reportedly made it clear to the TDP leaders that posting of officials was an administrative exercise and the party had no say in it.

â€œHow can we keep changing the officials just because some party leaders donâ€™t like them? There should be a valid reason for such demands,â€� Chandrababu Naidu reportedly told some senior party leaders when the latter sought the transfer of a particular official.

13,Karunakaran continues tirade against govt,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Continuing his tirade against the Anthony government, senior Congress leader K Karunakaran on Thursday said the 15-month-old rule of the UDF government had failed to make any fundamental change in any sector in the state and a ""major operation"" was needed to salvage the ""sagging"" image of the government.

""The Antony government had not been able to lift the restrictions on treasury payments which had been the main charge raised against the previous LDF regime,"" he told reporters here.

On the proposed ADB loan to be received by the state, he said it was only for specific projects and would not help improve the state''s treasury payment position.

The state government should come out with the facts regarding the amounts released by the Centre to help the state and the sum spent on various heads as the treasury restrictions were still on.

On the state DGP''s claim that the law and order situation had improved, Karunakaran said ""Yes, I read it in the papers. In the next column, there was a report about six murders.""
