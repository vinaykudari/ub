0,PJR flays govt's stand on Yeleru scam,"hyderabad:the written reply to the question on yeleru scam given by revenue minister p ashok gajapathi raju in the legislative assembly was contradictory to the government stand on appointment of the somashekara commission of inquiry, alleged senior congress leader p janardhan reddy. reddy told reporters on monday that the government had appointed the commission to look into the allegations of corruption, and after the ap high court had struck down the appointment on technical grounds, it did not approach the supreme court for redressal. reddy accused raju of taking selective portions of the sc judgement to discontinue the commission. he said that the sc had clearly stated that the commission should be continued. reddy distributed copies of the papers signed by chief minister n chandrababu naidu and the then minister kodela sivaprasad rao and other senior officials after it came to their notice that irregularities were committed. reddy said that the role of naidu was also suspect and reviving the commission would bring facts to light.

1,Anti-war rally in Patna,"patna: the bihar unit of the all india progressive women's association (aipwa) has decided to take out an anti-war rally at district headquarters on october 5. this was decided at aipwa's executive meeting held recently at samastipur. talking to reporters here on monday, aipwa secretary saroj chaube said the organisation was strongly opposed to the country's offer to the us for setting up a military base. the country's offer to the us will result in the loss of sovereignty and would prove disastrous, she said. according to her, the worst victim would be helpless women, children and old people. the sense of insecurity has developed among people, particularly muslims and sikhs, she said, adding that the country has done nothing in protecting lives of innocent people. the aipwa had discussed the impact of globalisation on women, gender-related development plan and its own strategy at a recently concluded state-level workshop held at samastipur, noting that the globalisation would adversely effect working class women. in order to make it more effective in bihar, the aipwa has decided to declare 2001 as membership drive year. it will mobilise women to put a pressure on the recently set up bihar women's commission to protect their interests.

2,Oppn rattles govt in Assembly,"patna: the state legislative assembly began on a stormy note on monday, with the entire opposition on their feet, raising slogans against the government on the flood and drought situation, and the recent killing of dalits. the placards they displayed had slogans demanding resignation of the state government. the placards were removed by house marshals. leader of the opposition sushil kumar modi said the government had remained a mute spectator to the killing of dalits. he also pressed for extension of the session, insisting that the tenure was too short to raise issues of public importance. speaker sadanand singh, while urging opposition members to remain silent, ruled that the flood and drought situation would be allowed to be discussed. the agenda of the house, too, could be discussed in the business advisory committee meeting. the speaker in his welcome address spoke on the growing threat of terrorism and the worldwide concern over it. he hoped that the country would play a ""constructive role"" against terrorism. parliamentary affairs minister ram chandra purbey tabled the first supplementary budget and ordinances cleared by the governor after the last sitting of the house in march. obituary references were made to deceased leaders and victims of terrorism in the usa before the house adjourned for tuesday. outside the house, the scene became volatile, with samata party and bjp mlas raising slogans at the gate of the assembly and displaying placards. they raised slogans like hatyari balatkari sarkar ko barkhast karo and demanded an all-party probe in the police firing on flood victims at aurai. cpi-ml (tnd) mla umadhar singh staged a dharna before the speaker's chamber to protest the ""non-distribution"" of relief material among people in his hayaghat constituency in the darbhanga district. he withdrew his dharna after chief minister rabri devi and rjd chief laloo prasad yadav assured that officials of the district had been directed to undertake distribution of relief material in his constiuency. at the business advisory committee meeting held in the chamber of the speaker, the government refused to heed to the request of the opposition to extend the current session of the house. the opposition made it clear that they would bring in an adjournment motion on tuesday against the government for the killings of dalits.

4,Staff protests BSEB revamp,"patna: thousands of power workers, including engineers, on monday staged a demonstration in front of the vidyut bhavan in protest against the restructuring of the bihar state electricity board (bseb). seventeen different organisations of the power workers participated in the demonstration. vehicular traffic was disrupted here at the bailey road (near vidyut bhavan) for several hours due to the power workers' demonstration. prominent among those who spoke on this occasion were the national president of the all india federation of power engineers association, shailendra dube, president of the rajasthan power engineering service association, b s meel, former mp, e balanandan and representatives of local organisations. the president of the power engineering service association (pesa), nagendra singh, presided over the meeting. speaking on this occasion, leaders vehemently opposed the restructuring of the bseb which will be disastrous for the state. citing example of orissa, they said that power engineers of orissa have not received their salary for the months of july and august. outsiders have been appointed as the coordinators while the management has started retrenching their staff, they said. apart from the huge financial loss, two thermal power stations have been sold out, they pointed out. ""we had opposed it in parliament when it was proposed by the then energy minister, n k p salve"", they said. later a six-member delegation submitted a three-page memorandum to the chief minister. the members included b l yadav, arjun prasad yadav, ganga rai, mahendra prasad singh, chakradhar prasad singh and bhola singh. when contacted, the secretary of the pesa, b l yadav, said that a delegation also submitted its memorandum to the secretary, department of energy. they have suggested a setting up a joint committee of representatives of union, officials and peoples representatives which will make on the spot investigation of such states who have unbundled the power sector. it may be recalled here that the powermen have decided to go on an indefinite strike from october 30 in protest against the restructuring of the bseb.

5,Panchayati Raj meet to test govt,"patna: for the administration, the proposed panchayati raj conference, slated for october 2, is proving to be a great headache on various fronts, including crowd control, problems faced by commuters and some legal tangles, as over 2.5 lakh people are expected to turn up here and 18,000 vehicles are being pooled in for transporting them from various parts of the state. the conference would be a massive event in the sense that 1.64 lakh elected candidates, including 40,000 women, of different panchayat bodies along with their near and dear ones would flock to the gandhi maidan to get advice from the government side and rule-books to guide them in running the panchayat bodies. some sections, however, feel the show is being organised merely to ""satisfy whims of the powers-that-be at the cost of travails to the administration and people"" as the conference would provide a chance to them to tell elected members that ""it was they who endeavoured to establish grassroots democracy in the state by holding election after 23 years."" interestingly, of the 20,000 buses plying in the state, only 3,500 are on the list of transport department, which genuinely pay tax and have proper road permits to operate on different routes, a senior ias official said, adding that the state administration has no valid reason to explain huge shortage caused by seizure of buses. ""the seizure can only be made under the people's representative act, enforced during the assembly or lok sabha elections, or under section 144 of the criminal procedure code,"" he said. moreover, there is a legal tangle, too, as the administration cannot allow the entry of heavy vehicles after 5 am in view of the patna high court order. perhaps, this would be the third largest gathering at the gandhi maidan after jp's meeting in 1974 in which about 5 lakh people had joined and october 12, 1990, garib rally addressed by former prime minister v p singh in which about 3.50 lakh people had participated. moreover, the entry of such a large number of buses into the city, apart from bringing traffic to a standstill, would add to the woes of both commuters and administration as the likely traffic jam caused by breakdown of a bus of the long convoy of vehicles carrying ""important delegtes"" is being feared. however, to meet exigencies the administration has decided to put up cranes at vantage points in naugachhia, barauni, koelwar, bihta and at zero mile in patna to immediately clear roads in the event of traffic jam. zonal additional dg rank officers have been instructed to monitor the movement of vehicles. special control rooms would be set up. the adg (rail), however, would take care of delegates coming by trains. delegates representing panchayat bodies would be lodged at 218 places for which buildings of schools and colleges have been reserved. all the schools and colleges would remain closed from september 29 to october 1, while october 2 is a gazetted holiday. since the hathia nakshatra is scheduled to begin from september 27, fears, however, are being raised that the show could be marred by heavy rain.

6,Congress rally might be in the shadow of rajputs,"pathankot:the date of the rally of the district congress committee (dcc) coincides with that of the punjab rajput maha sabha. this rally, scheduled for september 30, at gurdaspur, will, observers apprehend, not have the desired effect.this, comes as bad news for the congress, as of the ten lakh voters, three lakh are rajputs. observers feel that with such a large chunk of voters making a beeline for gharota, the venue of the rajput rally, the attendance at the congress rally will be thin. the congress' state-level rally is expected to be addressed by aicc treasurer and punjab congress in charge moti lal vora, and ppcc chief amarinder singh.while, the rajputs have gone ahead and invited former prime minister chander shekhar and former governor bhanu pratap singh to address the rally. congress organisers, on monday, said, ""the turnout will be effected only marginally."" joint secretary of the rajput sabha and secretary of gurdaspur rajput youth wing ravinder singh ""vikki"" said, ""we have worked a lot for the rally, which is likely to be attended by members from all over the state.the priority of each rajput member would be to attend their rally first"".inside dcc sources revealed that it was a ""foolish decision to organise the rally on september 30, as most of the rajputs are congress loyalists"". dcc office-bearer devinder singh darshi, said,""the absence of the rajputs will be felt. still, our efforts are on to make the rally a historic one.""even the dcc president raghunath sahai puri said that the absence of the rajputs will be felt. ""we still expect the rally to be a grand success,"" he added. meanwhile, on sunday evening, rajput sabha chairman vikram singh had said that they would support only those parties, who will protect the interests of the community.

7,Dera Bassi suicides raise many questions,"dera jagadhari: a day after his son allegedly committed suicide, 24-year-old balbir singh's aged father bachan singh was still running from pillar to post, seeking return of his son's body to conduct the last rites. balbir singh had allegedly committed suicide after consuming poison hours after 15-year-old saroj devi, residing barely six houses away in this village, died after similarly consuming a pesticide, possibly celphos, on sunday. but although saroj's body had been handed over to the family and the cremation already completed, bachan singh was still chasing police officials at the dera bassi police station, seeking permission to bring his son's body home for the last rites. police sources told times news network that they would release the body only after a postmortem. the sho at the dera bassi police station said that they were initiating action under section 174 of the crpc since the deaths were cases of alleged suicide. this sleepy village located near dera bassi was in mourning after the alleged suicides, which circumstantially indicates that the two were well known to each other.while saroj devi expired at the government medical college and hospital (gmch) in sector 32 at about 3.30 pm, balbir singh passed away at the pgi at 8 pm. hospital sources confirmed that both the youth had probably consumed celphos, either together or separately. saroj's father fateh chand, a police head constable posted at zirakpur, was not forthcoming with information. he denied that his daughter had consumed poison even as the medical report clearly mentioned poisoning as the cause of death. saroj, he pointed out, was a ""weak child"" and was suffering from a ""stomach disorder"". she had been taken to a registered medical practitioner at dera bassi. he, however, declined to reveal the rmp's name. he said that the reason for his daughter's death was ""a wrong injection given by the rmp at dera bassi"". fateh chand also denied that balbir singh had accompanied them to the hospital with saroj as claimed by his relatives at pgi, on sunday. balbir's modest household was in a state of shock. balbir has two older sisters and two younger bothers. he had been sharing the responsibility of supporting his family members with bachan singh. balbir's mother was inconsolable and unable to speak. relatives confirmed that balbir had accompanied saroj to the doctor, ""but he suddenly took very ill after he returned with her body. he had to be taken to chandigarh immediately"". interestingly, parents of both balbir and saroj were not at home on sunday morning.while saroj's mother had gone to attend an engagement party in an adjoining village and the father was on duty, balbir was also alone in the house most of the morning. neighbours, however, refused to comment on the relationship between the deceased. ---- student found dead times news network sas nagar: a phd student of national institute of pharmaceutical education and research (niper) was found dead in his hostel room here on sunday under mysterious circumstances. however, police officers have ruled out the possibility of the youth having committed suicide. police sources said shailesh garjesh shastri (26), hailing from maharashtra, was found dead on his bed by his hostel mates, around 4 pm. shailesh is learnt to have met with a road accident some days ago in which he suffered a head injury. though the cause of the death would be ascertained only after a postmortem, sources do not rule out brain haemorrhage leading to the death.

8,Bleach pleads for 'equality before law',"kolkata: appearing in person before the calcutta high court, convicted british arms dealer peter bleach on monday submitted that while the five latvians were released by a presidential remission in july last year, he remained in jail. this is nothing but discrimination on the part of the central government, he said. this submission was made before the division bench comprising justice nure alam chowdhury and justice narayan chandra sil which, in an order passed earlier, granted leave to bleach to appear and argue his appeal personally. bleach and the five latvians were awarded life sentence by a city court on february 2 last year for air-dropping a huge cache of arms and ammunition from an an-26 aircraft on some villages in west bengal's purulia district on december 17, 1995. the convicts preferred an appeal before the calcutta high court in march 2000 against the trial court's order. later, the latvians were released following a commutation of their life sentence by president k.r. narayanan. while trying to raise the question of discrimination in the issue of releasing latvians, bleach further submitted that this is nothing but breach of article 14 (equality before the law) and article 21 (freedom of person) of the constitution. he added that he had filed a habeas corpus application before the supreme court through the british deputy high commission and argued that while that application was pending before the apex court, this court could not proceed with the appeal case. the division bench was of the opinion that if this court could not solve this problem, the case might be referred to a larger bench. the court, however, assured bleach of all assistance and help for him to plead the appeal case and directed him to file affidavit on his submission. october 5 is the next date of hearing.

9,Peace rally urges sanity,"kolkata: christians in kolkata took out a procession on monday to condemn attempts to equate a particular religion with terrorism and acts of violence. ""terrorists have no religion, god is love and he is one"" - the placards said it all. in the wake of terrorist attacks on washington and new york, and the us government's subsequent decision to attack afghanistan, the bangiya christiya pariseba took up the cudgels to explain that religion should not be used as a tool to spread unrest and violence. ""people should not get carried away by fundamentalist leaders and fan the fire to spread terror in the name of religion,"" said bcp general secretary herod mullick. bcp, regional partner of the all-india christian council for eastern india, organised the rally on behalf of the council in front of st. teresa's church in moulali during the day. ""terrorism has nothing to do with religion. churches all over the country are praying for peace and for those who have lost their lives in america,"" he said. students, men and women from different churches in the city participated in the rally. hymns were sung, candles lit amid prayers by father noel d'souza. naxalites protest eight naxalite groups on monday held a protest demonstration before the heavily-guarded american center here and burnt us president george w. bush's effigy, denouncing the us administration's war moves against afghanistan. the naxalite factions alleged that the bush administration had been ""plotting to involve india"" in its ""war preparedness"" without identifying the attackers on the world trade center and the pentagon. ""we condemn the terrorist attacks in new york and washington, but it is a cause for concern that the vajpayee government's move to get implicated in the war will put more financial burden on india and curb the people's democratic rights,"" a leader said. earlier, the naxalites took out a procession from s.c. mullick square to the american center.

12,Updating farm technology,"palanpur: a three-day long fourth training cum workshop of krushi vigyan kendra(kvk) of two western states (rajasthan and gujarat) concluded at sardar krushinagar dantiwada on thursday with a resolution to exchange the agricultural technology developed by the scientists of agricultural universities in both the states. assistant director general indian council of agricultural research (icar) a n shukla, chief guest said the information technology evolved by gau was a unique experiment in the sphere of agriculture in the country. the communication facility developed in gau should benefit farmers elsewhere in the country. the main characteristic of the device is that a farmer can seek guidance from any expert even while sitting in the remotest spot in his village. this saved his time and energy to traverse a long way to and from the university. ""if this technology was made familiar in other parts of the country we can bring about radical changes, both qantative and qualitative in the output. its main characteristic is two- way communication facility"", said shukla who was impressed by the innovative device. inaugurating the function, vice-chancellor m h mehta said the popularity of the it krushi goshthi has inspired other states to emulate the model. gau has been approached by other states who wished to share the experience and expertise. ""we have put forward our claim even before the planning commission to allow a special slot for the it technology for agricultural development. looking at the vital challenges in the agricultural field, it is necessary for our traditional farming to undergo changes keeping in view demands of the times. the days have gone when a farmer helplessly relied on luck. now the farmer is not that helpless; he is a part of knowledgeable society"", he added. he emphasised on the need to take krushi gosthi in every nook and corner to enable a toiling farmer to repair his fortune along with the prosperity of the country. campus director girish patel said delegates came here from 31 krushi vikas kendra (kvks) in rajasthan and 10 kvks from the state. zonal director r n prashad gave a brief account and objective of the seminar cum work shop at sardar krushinagar, gau's main campus. director of extension b d patel was also present.

14,Govt flouting GPCB chief appointment norm since inception,"ahmedabad: retired bureaucrats, in-service bureaucrats, army officers, builder-cum-politician _ gujarat pollution control board (gpcb) has seen them all as its chairpersons, but never an environment expert. although it is mandatory to have either specialised knowledge or practical experience in environment protection for a person to hold the gpcb chairperson's post, the state government has been outrightly violating this ever since gpcb's inception in 1974. barring a couple of exceptions when the chairpersons were engineers in public health or water, most of the 19 chairpersons that the gpcb has seen did not qualify for the post as per the law. now, even the comptroller and auditor general of india (cag) has taken a serious note of this violation in its recent report for 2000. it has criticised the state government. ""under section 4 of the water act, the state government should appoint as a chairman of the gpcb such a person who has special knowledge and practical experience or administrative experience and knowledge related to such institutes. between 1990 to 2000, three chairmen have been appointed of which one was an active politician and two retired bureaucrats, one of who was appointed under a chief minister's direction,"" the report says. the cag has also noted that the forest and environment department did not even have information about their knowledge and practical experience, hence the auditors could not verify whether their appointments were in accordance with the legal provisions! the section 4(2) of the water act 1974, which was amended in 1980, clearly lays the pre-requisites for chairman's nomination. ""a chairman, being a person having specialised knowledge or practical experience in respect of matters relating to environmental protection or a person having knowledge and experience in administering in institutions dealing into matters aforesaid, be nominated by the state government."" critics believe that retired bureaucrats, who are appointed solely at the mercy of their political masters, fail to take any action of consequence. the result is that the pollution keeps increasing and the board remains inactive and ineffective. ""environmental experts are not appointed and by violating all legal provisions, political persons are appointed. such people naturally fail to understand the technical matters. the same holds true for other techno-administrative issues,"" says mahesh pandya, an environmental engineer with the centre for social justice. a retired bureaucrat, r parthasarthy, who is also an environment expert with specialisation in a number of environmental subjects, commented, ""such posts are usually filled by bureuacrats and political appointees who don't have any technical knowledge."" while refraining to comment on the issue, central pollution control board chairman dilip biswas told the times news network that the issue has been discussed in details at a conference in coimbatore in january, 2001. chairpersons 1) prof r s mehta 15/10/74 to 7/5/79 (public health engineer) 2) r c modi 8/5/79 to 25/7/79 (public health engineer) 3) prof r s mehta 26/7/79 to 19/2/82 (public health engineer) 4) dr r c trivedi 16/3/82 to 21/10/82 (engineer) 5) pradhyumansinh 22/20/82 to 9/8/84 (ias, bureaucrat) 6) ashok koshy 10/9/84 to 28/10/84 (ias, bureaucrat) 7) dr g sundaram 29/10/84 to 31/12/85 (ias, bureaucrat) 8) ashok koshy 1/1/86 to 6/3/86 (ias, bureaucrat) 9) lt gen k mahipatsinh 7/3/86 to 14/10/90 (army) 10) g subbarao 15/10/90 to 26/11/90 (ias, bureaucrat) 11) j r patel 26/11/90 to 9/1/95 (mla, builder turned politician) 12) g r virdi 21/1/95 to 25/5/95 (ias, bureaucrat) 13) ms s k shekhon 24/5/95 to 26/6/95 (ias, bureaucrat) 14) g r virdi 26/6/95 to 8/9/95 (ias, bureaucrat) 15) p v bhatt 8/9/95 to 2/9/97 (retired ias turned politician) 16) t c a rangadurai 3/9/97 to 23/9/97 (ias, bureaucrat) 17) p v swaminathan 24/9/97 to 5/4/2000 (retired bureaucrat) 18) p basu 5/4/2000 to 7/7/2000 (ias, bureaucrat) 19) k v bhaujan from 7/7/2000 (retired bureaucrat)

15,"Caste is all, but party 'brand' still matters","ahmedabad: the results of the sabarkantha lok sabha and sabarmati assembly seats, declared on saturday, have come as an eye-opener. the ethnic and religious polarisation, revealed in trends, coupled with instances of a near rejection of regional outfits have raised concerns. while a low voter turnout may not give much to read into, that the contest was focused between the congress and the bharatiya janata party is likely to provoke many leaders contemplating the launch of a third front in gujarat to rethink. the other concern is the major swing of around 42,000 votes in sabarkantha in favour of two independent candidates -- sabirbhai rathod (27,089) and fazlurehman saldarehman pathan (12,424) who contested for the first time. this trend has disturbed both the congress and the bjp, which had earlier won votes by merely flaunting the hindutva card. interestingly, in the campaigns, the congress took on the mantle of hindutva in a back-handed fashion at sabarmati, while the bjp resorted to methods like posing congress candidate madhusudan mistry as a ""christian padri"" at sabarkantha. coming from none less than chief minister keshubhai patel, this perspective of the adversary only bared the fact that issues had been put on the back burner as religion held fort. then, of course, was the stunt of political workers from minority groups being sent in to campaign in hindu-dominated areas. whose stunt it was is yet to be determined, but the fact is that a couple of bjp workers from the minority community were exploited to ignite religious sentiments. incidentally, the bjp, which had thought that hastening of the madhavpura bank revival and even the strikes on the us would translate into votes for the party, are now troubled by the turn of fate. mistry's victory in sabarkantha has made former chief minister shankersinh vaghela jubilant, albeit he surprises you with a sudden turnabout. ask him about the prospect of a third front in the present political scenario, he says, ""there is no hope for a third front!"" vaghela, who briefly floated the rashtriya janata party and went on to become chief minister, adds as a afterthought, ""a regional party means a lot of work, time and money and there has to be some continuity. maybe, if i'd continued, it might have been successful ...."" ""we are thankful to keshubhai for this victory, for his misrule, the corruption and his indecisive nature,"" vaghela adds. ""out of question!"" is the retort from gujarat pradesh congress committee vice-president hasmukh patel when asked about a third front. then there are congress leaders who cite instances of the late chimanbhai patel who eventually merged with the congress and kept the janata dal group floating. vaghela and patel deny the rejection-by-minorities factor, although a section of leaders are concerned about it and mince no words to say that ""it needs to be investigated as to whether the minorities have indeed lost confidence in the congress or was it a deliberate strategy to divide the congress votes"". but mistry reacts, saying, ""the people have rejected the politics of negation, hate and victimisation."" at least for the time being, the sabarkantha and sabarmati results seem to say: better be a small fish in a big pond, because 'brand' names still matter!

16,KPT plea to double lease rate of salt farms rejected,"gandhidham: the tariff authority for major parts (tamp) has rejected the kandla port trust (kpt) proposal for revising lease rate by 100 per cent in respect of land allotted to salt manufacturers and ordered the port to consider the revision of lease rentals in respect salt land along with the proposal for an over all lease revision, which for other land had been postponed. the government of india had in guidelines issued to the port stated that the base of lease rent shall be revised every five years. this was due in july, 1999. based on a high-level committee recommendations, the kpt proposed a 100 per cent hike. the lease rent per acre per annum for plots up to 10 acres was rs. 200 per acre, for plots beyond 10 acre and up to 100 acres was rs. 100 per acre and for those above 100 acres was rs.65 per acre. these rates were proposed to be increased to rs. 400, 200 and 130 respectively. tamp had invited objections/representations from the users and their representative bodies. kutch small scale salt manufacturers' association represented that the increase is abnormally high and unjustified. kpt has based the hike on the fair rate of return on the capital, which is not a fair proposition. kpt is already charging escalation of five per cent in the lease rent charges. the association also submitted that the existing rates of lease rent for the kpt salt lands are the highest compared to lease rent rates of salt lands in rajasthan, maharashtra, karnataka, goa, tamil nadu and west bengal. it urged tamp that a further enhancement would be detrimental to the salt industry, which is reeling under unprecedented recession and financial crisis. rates in the neighbouring states had not been considered before revising the rates. the gandhidham chamber of commerce and industry also opposed the hike and endorsed the association views. the chamber submitted that in the past three years there have been cyclones, an earthquake and drought in gujarat. the state government has agreed to remit for losses. the kpt must also be equally sympathetic and postpone this revision. the state government has given substantial relief to 700 salt units on their land. after comprehensive consideration of the case, tamp held that the lease rent was supposed to be computed with reference to the land value which was supposed to be derived from sale transactions of comparable land in the neighbourhood. no such data are reported to be available to enable computation in accordance with this formula. the government guidelines prescribe a revision of the 'base rate' quinquennially. this has been taken by the kpt to mean a revision of the 'lease rent' itself. this understanding of kpt does not appear to be correct. tamp said that bearing in mind the unfortunate fact that the kutch area has been hit by two cyclones, one earthquake and one drought in the past four years, it has accepted the kpt's request for putting off the matter relating to revision of land rentals in the gandhidham township area. tamp opined that the same analogy could be applied for the land allotted to salt manufacturers. the authority has ordered kpt to take up the case of salt lands for revision of rentals only when the other land cases are found to be ready for such reconsideration. infrastructure project: in the aftermath of the earthquake, kandla port trust has taken initiative to provide relief to victims and to restore the infrastructure in the damaged area. a fund, kandla earthquake relief fund (kerf), has been set up under the chairman to execute works of repairs and strengthening of four roads of gandhidham adipur township. for this, rs. 100 lakh had been granted to nbcc for road repairs and maintenance through paver finish. besides, rs. 106 lakh has been sanctioned to nbcc as grant in aid for improvement of l8 circles in gandhidham adiput towns. this will help in the beautification of the township. the lighting/illumination on the roads will be improved at a cost of rs. 35 lakhs through geb. in order to promote health and culture activities, a grant of rs. 2.16 lakh has been sanctioned to the kutch district badminton association, which has been providing facilities to upcoming sportspeople.
