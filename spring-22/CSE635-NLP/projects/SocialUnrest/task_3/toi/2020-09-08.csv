0,JDS politicising farmers death: Minister,"MYSORE: Minister D.K.Shivakumar on Monday accused the JDS leaders, particularly H.D.Devegowda of politicizing the farmers deaths in state and said Congress is ready for a public debate on the issue.

At a press meet here, he said some of the deaths may be debt related incidents, but majority of them are not related to farm loans. ""This has to be investigated to expose the JDS leaders"" he said adding that Krishna government has done a lot for the farming community .

He said the JDS leaders, especially Devegowda with an eye on the elections to the state assembly and parliament are linking every death of a person in village to farmers deaths. ""We are ready to debate the issue with the JDS eladers on a public platform"" he challenged and said every incident is being politicized by the JDS leaders. ""They did not spare even Vitlenahalli incident to gain political mileage"" he recollected .

Claiming the recent package announced by the state government as the best one for farmers in the recent past, Shivakumar said let the JDS leaders disclose what they did for the farmers during their regime and Congress leaders will say what their government did for the farmers.

""People who never bothered to do anything during their rule are now dubbing the Congress as anti-farmers"" he regretted, terming Devegowda as an ""untrustworthy man"". "" Devegowda who did not attend Byregowdaâ€™s funeral with whom he worked for more than 25 years is now shedding tears over the farmers deaths"" he taunted and said the Centre should announce various relief measures for the farmers who are facing severe drought .

2,NDA govt failed to solve farmers problems: Rai,"MANGALORE: District incharge minister Ramanath Rai on Sunday alleged that the NDA government at the Centre had failed the farmers in every respect by not responding to their problems.

Speaking at the block level farmers and agricultural workers meet, organised by Mangalore North Zone Congress Committee, Rai said not only in the state, but all over the country farmers were in trouble due to lopsided policies of the Centre.

He alleged that the NDA and its allies were indulging in caste and religious politics instead of thinking of welfare of the people, especially farmers.

Rai said the state government had announced several packages for the welfare of the farming community and asserted that Congress was always in the forefront to make farmers self-reliant. He urged the partyworkers to take the government''s programmes to the people and educate the farmers to avail of those schemes.

5,Auto bandh from Sept 22,"HYDERABAD: The Auto Drivers Joint Action Committee on Monday called for an indefinite auto bandh from Sept. 22 seeking auto fares on par with other states.

6,Strong Re lowers govt's RIB burden,"NEW DELHI: The government''s burden towards meeting the redemptions of Resurgent India Bonds, due on October 1, 2003, will be reduced with rupee gaining ground against dollar.

According to a banking source, the government will have to shell out around Rs 675 crore now, compared to the earlier estimation of over Rs 2000 crore.

According to the condition agreed between the government and SBI, for raising money in foreign currencies, SBI was supposed to bear the cost of currency depreciation up to one per cent per annum. Beyond this, the government will bear the cost.

The foreign currencies denominated bonds were raised by SBI in 1998 to improve foreign investors'' sentiment. At that time, the sentiment was down with US sanction on trade, after India''s decision to undertake the Pokharan nuclear test. The successful bond issue had arrested the sharp fall in rupee.

The rupee-dollar exchange rate during the bond issue in September 1998 was around Rs 42.50. The value of dollar as per one per cent per annum depreciation would be Rs 44.65. But the exchange rate at present is around Rs 45.95 per dollar.

This means, for the redemption of every dollar, government will have to bear a cost of Rs 1.30 per dollar.

The bond issue fetched a total of $4.23 billion. Of this, 94.5 per cent had come in dollar term. The rest around $240 million was raised in pound sterling and DM. The interest rate offered on dollar denominated bond was 7.75 per cent, on pound sterling (8 per cent) and DM (6.25 per cent).

According to SBI, redemption amount, including the interest, is $5.2 billion. As for the redemption of every dollar, the government will have to give around Rs 1.30. But, if rupee further appreciates by October 1, 2003, the amount will be further reduced.

But at the time of bond issue, it was expected that rupee would depreciate at least by 3 per cent per annum. So, government liabilities would have been around Rs 2,400 crore. But, the rupee appreciation saved the government from this huge cost.

7,J&K govt takes control of 89 Muslim shrines,"SRINAGAR: In a what could be described as a well planned coup, the Mufti Mohammed government on Tuesday took over the management of about eighty-nine Muslim shrines and dismantled the Muslim Auqaf Trust headed by former chief minister Farooq Abdullah by promulgating an ordinance.

Jammu and Kashmir Law Minister Muzaffar Hussian Beig said the state cabinet decided to take over the Muslim Auqaf Trust (MAT) and hand it over to a non-political governing body headed by Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed as its ex-officio chairman.

Justifying the action, Beig said the government was prompted to take over the Muslim shrines and the properties affiliated with the earlier MAT following reports of swindling of funds collected as donations from various shrines across the valley.

""Since there was an apprehension based on credible information received from different sources that there might be further attempts to swindle assets and properties of various trusts, the government found it feasible to direct all deputy commissioners and superintendents of police to take over the charge of the shrines in the valley,"" Beig said.

He also cited the possibility of desecration of eight to ten extremely sensitive holy relics housed in various shrines of the valley by certain miscreants, hence the step.

Giving details of the Jammu and Kashmir Specified Wakafs and Specified Wakaf Properties (Management and Regulation) Ordinance, 2003, Beig described the composition of the board to be headed by the chief minister as as a body of apolitical persons.

Muzaffar Beig lashed out at the Sheikh family for sanctioning the interest free loans from the donations collected from various shrines in favour of persons who did not deserve this facility.

Beig said there was also a need to regulate the conduct of the persons who serve in various Dargahs, Khankahs so that better services to the pilgrims were met. This would attract the tourist pilgrimage to various shrines across the Kashmir Valley, he noted.

The state cabinet on late Monday evening decided to form a committee which would work out the modalities for the constitution of a non-political trust which would henceforth administer these religious institutions and their affiliates on the pattern of the Mata Vaishno Devi Trust board.

Reports said that the DIG Baramulla was supervising the operation at the famous Baba Reshi shrine in Tangmarg while Dy SP Budgam was heading the operation at Chrar-e-Sharief. Police have also taken control of the Dargah Hazratbal and other important shrines.

Meanwhile, reacting to the take-over, National Conference President Omar Abdullah said that his party will fight it out both politically as also legally.

""We knew this was going to happen. That it was done on September 8, the death anniversary of Sher-i-Kashmir Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah indicates Mufti''s deep hatred against Sheikh Sahib,"" Omar added.

""Why was MAT singled out. Why not Jamia Masjid, institutes run by Jamiat-ul-Ahl-e-Hadis and shia community?"" Omar questioned.

""Mufti thinks that by stooping so low he will weaken NC. He is mistaken. We''ll emerge stronger from this as people know who is doing what,"" Omar said.

11,Govt to rope in celebrities to counsel farmers,"BANGALORE: Even as official figures for farmers'' suicides touched 208 in Karnataka, the government is set to launch a massive counter campaign by roping in ``anyone who matters.'' to counsel the affected.

Development Commissioner Vijay Gore told reporters here on Tuesday: ""Chief Minister S M Krishna will make a formal appeal to all celebrities to lend their voice to this very serious issue. He has already made a start by himself counselling farmers against taking the extreme step of suicide.""

Gore said the message should go to every farmer under the stress of the third year of drought that suicide was not an option, even to gain the compensation of Rs 1 lakh offered by the government. ""They need to realise that they leave their near and dear ones to face the same stress that they escaped through suicide,"" he added.

Stressing that celebrities and people from every field would be asked to speak out against suicide, Gore said: ``I would listen if Sachin Tendulkar spoke out against it. Similarly, there will be other such models for other people, all of whom should respond to the government''s appeal.""

Officials are putting the final touches to a plan to use local psychiatrists and psychologists to ensure that depression among the farming community does not lead to suicide. The issue is delicate as few people accept they are contemplating suicide or try to deal with it through counselling, which carries a social stigma, he said.

14,1984 riot victims want retrial outside Delhi,"NEW DELHI: On the lines of cases pertaining to Gujarat riots, victims of 1984 anti-Sikh riots on Tuesday petitioned National Human Rights commission (NHRC) to move Supreme Court for retrial in cases against Congress leader HKL Bhagat and others accused outside Delhi.

""We have asked for a petition seeking retrial in cases filed by Darshan Kaur and Satnami Bai because the present state government does not intend to bring the culprits to justice as they belong to the ruling party,"" Kuldeep singh Bhogal, president of All India Riot Victims Relief Committee (AIRVRC), said.

The organisation''s members met NHRC chairman AS Anand and requested him to move Supreme Court on their behalf, the way the commission has done in the case of Gujarat riots.

""The chairman has responded sympathetically to our plea,"" AIRVRC general secretary RP Singh said after the meeting. The organisation alleged that Satnami Bibi had to retract her statement against Bhagat under threat while the statements of Darshan Kaur, who they claimed, withstood rigorous cross-examination by Bhagat''s lawyers, were not enough to bring the culprits to justice.

Pointing a finger at the state government, Bhogal said it was unfortunate that it did not file an appeal against the acquittal, showing its disinterest in providing justice to the riot victims.

17,Yet another suicide attempt at Metro,"KOLKATA: Yet another suicide attempt led to the disruption of Metro railway services in Kolkata during the peak hours on Tuesday.

Forty-five-year-old Subir Kumar Shaw jumped in front of the Dum Dum bound train at Esplanade Station at 10.58 am. The alert driver applied emergency brake and the train stopped just before Shaw, leaving him sustaining minor injuries.

Subir was removed to SSKM Hospital, but the train was held up for twenty minutes, leading to cancellation of one train and rescheduling of two trains, a metro spokesperson said. This was the 106th attempt on the metro track. Fortysix people died in metro since its inception.

Subirâ€™s ticket shows that he bought the ticket at 9.07 am. But it took him nearly two hours to reach the decision of ending his life. His sister Dipti Nandy said, â€œHe had mild fever and he went out on the pretext of buying medicine.â€�

Subir, indeed, bought medicine which were found in his pocket along with spectacles. Metro Railway police officer said, his behaviour is symptomatic of extremely volatile mind. â€œHe was under tremendous mental agony which eventually changed into a suicidal mind,â€� said the officer, who had handled plenty of such cases in recent time.

His mental agony could also be gauged in the words of Subirâ€™s relatives. â€œHe was extremely worried over his financial condition. He recently became grandfather. Subir and his two brotherâ€™s only source of income was the garment shop â€˜Elegantâ€™ at New Market. Recently, another shop my brothers used to run was sold out. This made him really anxious as the head of the family,â€� said his sister Dipti Nandy.

His family members admitted that he had expressed a number of times suicide tendency. â€œBut we never thought that he was serious,â€� said his brothers. Fellow shop-keepers in the New Market, however, found something very wrong with Subir.

â€œNowadays, he appeared very apprehensive. We were bit surprised to see an amiable person changed into worried man,â€� a fellow shop-owner said.

18,Mamata visits violence hit Chakdah,"KOLKATA: Newly sworn in Union minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday evening rushed to Chakdah in the Nadia district where a Trinamul Congress leader and anchal pradhan was shot dead on Monday.

She left for the spot immediately after landing at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose airport in Kolkata. Meanwhile, the Trinamul had called a 24-hour Nadia district bandh in protest against the killing, opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee added.

Chakdah block district Trinamul Congress president Samir Nag(47) was shot dead by unknown assailants near Dubra gram panchayat office. In a violent backlash, about 16 shops and 20 houses, one truck and two motor cycles were set on fire, a police official in Krishnagar said.

""Samir Nag was very close to me and I am shocked at the incident. He was a President''s Award recipient and the local Anchal Pradhan. Such attacks on our party leaders are being carried out across the state and will continue so long as the CPM is in power. I have always maintained that there is no scope for such blood-letting in politics and have asked Trinamul workers to counter the menace politically,"" Mamata said.

""I have just landed in Kolkata and am still shocked at the death. In fact, I have been this way from Monday after I heard the news. Please do not ask me to comment on anything else,"" Mamata reacted sharply to a question on her discussions with the Prime Minister regarding her portfolio.

Banerjee said the CPM had taken a planned strategy to kill Trinamul supporters in the districts. ""Day before yesterday, one of our leaders was killed in Hooghly,"" he said.

CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said, however, that the killing was a sequel of an intra-party rivalry in the Trinamul. ""Now that Mamata Banerjee has become a minister, Trinamul supporters have become enthused to start violent incidents. We had apprehended this."" As a sequel to the killing, CPM activist Kabiruddin was killed and CPM local committee secretary Asim Ray was injured, he said.

Violent Trinamul supporters set fire to houses at Bishnupur, Dubra and Deuri, Biswas said. ""It will not help, however. The administration is alert."" He feared similar incidents could take place all over the state. The police refused to comment on what had led to the killing before completing the investigations.

Train services were disrupted in the Sealdah - Krishnagar section of the Eastern Railway for nearly three hours on Tuesday morning as irate Trinamul Congress supporters erected blockades on the railway track in protest against the killing. Trains were stopped at Chakdah and Kalyani stations.

19,Mulayam boosts morale of party workers,"LUCKNOW: A day after Mulayam Singh Yadav won the vote of confidence in Assembly, the Samajwadi Party activists continue to throng the party office in large numbers.

The people had begun thronging the Vikramaditya Marg situated party office since morning. Their wait finally ended at 3 pm when the SP president''s cavalcade reached the office. The security had a tough time controlling the crowd as it surged forward to meet its leader.

However once Mulayam stood atop the `takhat'' which served as a makeshift platform, a semblance of order was restored immediately. While directing the workers to sit down he repeatedly asked them to ensure that no harm was done to the plants and small trees. ""Paudhon ko bachana nahin to jurmana dena padega"" (dont harm the trees or you will have to pay a fine) he kept reminding them amid laughter.

But once he took the mike the chief minister donned many caps. He assumed the role of a leader when he rebuked the workers for not paying the required attention towards strengthening the party organization or highlighting its achievements.

As a chief minister he reminded them that he represented all the parties of the coalition government and the interest of the state was paramount for him.

For the 50 odd students of the Shri Ram Murthy Smarak College of Engineering and Technology, Bareilly the CM represented the only hope of resolving their problem and on which depended their future viz ensuring that their course was given recognition by the Pharmacy Council of India.

The CM met them personally and assured that the right steps would be taken in the direction of redressing their grievance.

The CM did not disappoint those who had brought written complaints. The meeting in effect served as a mini Janata darbar also.

20,Mulayam's target: A dream government,"LUCKNOW: Having donned the mantle of the chief minister for the third time Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday said it was his desire that the government of Uttar Pradesh headed by his party should be an ideal one and the example of good governance set by it should be emulated by other states of the country.

He said this was the dream of the Samajwadi Party and the onus of realising it rested on the workers.

With this end in view, he said the MLAs as also the workers would henceforth be directed not to make a beeline for the Annexe but to address their grievances at 5, Kalidas Marg, the official residence of the CM.

He added it would be his endeavour to ensure that the UP Assembly ran its full session so that public related issues could be taken up.

Addressing his first meeting after winning the vote of confidence the chief minister took the SP workers to task on some counts while thanking them simultaneously for having struggled for 8 long years to put the party in the seat of power.

He did not fail to mention that during these years the workers had to put up with a lot at the hands of governments who did not hesitate to subject them to all kinds of hardships including jail terms.

Mulayam said the struggle had not ended for the people now had a lot of expectations from the government which had inherited many problems including an empty treasury.The party, he added had to show results by way of hard work. Unlike the Congress which survived on talks of freedom struggle and the Nehru-Gandhi name, the BJP which exploited religious and caste sentiments and the BSP which only spoke about one section of society, the SP only had the thoughts of its leaders to guide it.

The CM said the period of celebrations had ended and the time for hard work had begun. He regretted that party organization was not as strong as he wanted it to be and the leaders as also the workers made no effort to dessimate the achievements of the government.He said the SP was the first party which had enunciated the idea of Ambedkar villages yet it was discredited for harming Ambedkar.The party''s contribution for the welfare of minorities, traders and others was by no means small yet it never got the credit for it. Mulayam said the responsibility for this lay with the workers and the leaders.

Maintaining that the margin of victory during the vote of confidence had surprised him also the CM told the workers that they should not forget that he was heading a coalition government.He asked them to act with restrain in all spheres and to become `vinamra'' (soft) in their approach.

Earlier national general secretary Amar Singh said the chief minister was due to leave for Delhi on Tuesday where he was slated to meet the prime minister, deputy prime minister and other leaders.He however postponed the same when he came to know that workers in scores were waiting for him at the party office.

Asking the workers to convert their `josh'' into `hosh'' Singh said they were the real strength of the party and it was their job to ensure that Mulayam Singh Yadav was represented through them in every lane, bylane and mohalla of the state.

21,Gareeb hatao order foxes state govt,"GANDHINAGAR: In what sounds like a ""gareeb hatao"" rather than ""gareebi hatao"" campaign, the Gujarat government has been told by the Centre to drastically cut down the number of families living below the poverty line (BPL).

If the directive is executed, nearly 25 lakh BPL households may be deprived of food, social welfare and health-related subsidies worth Rs 2,000 crore that they are currently entitled to.

Under the new central guidelines, Gujarat is being told to revise its 35.52 lakhstrong BPL list. After sitting over the issue for six months, the state has finally begun the new survey, albeit only as a ""pilot project"" in seven talukas.

Ironically, even today, the Centre recognises just 21.20 lakh as BPL families in Gujarat as against the state''s claim of 35.52 lakh. In July, the state government went so far as to ask the Gujarat MPs to raise the issue in Parliament to get foodgrains subsidy for the 14 lakh families who were left out.

Now, the Union ministry of rural development, finding the figure of even 21.20 lakh rather inflated, has asked Gujarat, as well as other states, to conduct a new survey of all the BPL households. ""The ministry has asked is to limit the number of BPL families to around 10.36 lakh, plus or minus 10 per cent,"" said a top Sachivalya official. The state''s rural development commissionerate has begun the difficult task of weeding out families from the BPL list.

The Centre has based its figure of 10.36 lakh BPL families in Gujarat on the latest National Sample Survey. It presumes that in Gujarat, 16 per cent households live below the poverty line. There are 63.68 lakh rural households in the state.

So far, as a pilot project, the officialdom has finished surveying 2.5 lakh rural families of Tharad taluka (Banaskantha), Sami (Patan), Nakhatrana (Kutch), Patdi (Surendranagar), Malia-Hathina (Junagadh) and Lunavada (Panchmahals).

The apprehension is strong that once the survey picks up, there would be considerable political pressure against the omissions. Senior minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma has told officials that some solution will have to be found to this problem. ""Nothing will happen. BPL families will continue to get the benefits,"" he said.

The Centre wants the new survey to be based on 13 different criteria â€” the type of consumer durables each family has, the size of operational holding, the type of house, average availability of normal wear, food security, sanitation, literacy status, status of the household labour, means of livelihood, status of children, type of indebtedness, reason for migration from household and preference of assistance.

In the past, if the gram sevak certified a family for the BPL list, it was readily done. Now, a new survey will be carried out based on the central guideline.
