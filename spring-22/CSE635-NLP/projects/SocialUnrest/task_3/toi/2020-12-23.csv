Verma said that Kanwaljit Singh, who belongs to Jheor caste, got a false scheduled caste certificate showing his caste as â€˜Mahasha'' issued on his name on the verification of Jagdish Loomba, former deputy mayor of the Municipal Corporation.

After the elections, Bhairo Singh, a councillor, had submitted a complaint against Kanwaljit Singh. The complaint was marked for inquiry to SDM (east), who further got it verified through tehsildar and kanungo of the circle.

In his inquiry, the SDM (E) reported that Loomba had stated that he knew Kanwaljit Singh and verified his caste as â€˜Mahasha'' only on the basis of an affidavit submitted by him.

Ranjit Singh Dhillon, former councillor, ward number 6, Saroop Kaur, president of Istri Sabha, ward number 6, Gurdip Singh president of Lajpat Nagar and other residents of the ward had also stated that they personally knew Kanwaljit Singh and he belongs to Jheor caste.

The SDM (E) established that Kanwaljit Singh, by procuring a false scheduled caste certificate, had committed an offence.

The deputy commissioner said that a legal report had been got from the district attorney in this regard, who also established that Kanwaljit Singh had committed forgery by preparing a false scheduled caste certificate. He opined that Kanwaljit Singh prima facie had committed an offence punishable under Sections 420, 419, 465, 467, 468 of the IPC and recommended to register a criminal case against him.

1,Punjab govt 'puts off' land deal with,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government, on Tuesday, ""postponed"" a controversial land deal with liquor baron Ponty Chadha.

""Yes, the deal has been postponed,"" principal secretary (industries) S C Agarwal said. ""There was some doubt about a policy detail and until that is cleared, the decision has been postponed,"" he said but did not detail the policy confusion. ""That is a matter of detail,"" he said.

The decision was taken at a highlevel official meeting.

Under the proposed deal, 50 acres of land at the industrial focal point, Mohali, were to be given to Chadhaâ€™s company, A B Motions Private Limited, at Rs 40 lakh per acre. This was under the ""off-the-shelf scheme"" meant to promote industries in the state.

Chadha was to develop multiplexes, shopping malls and the like on the land allotted to him. Given the prevailing land prices in the area, the deal had evoked controversy with accusations of precious land being given away at throwaway prices.

Under the deal, Chadha had to pay only 15 per cent of the cost of land and the rest was to be paid back over a period of time.

Shiromani Akali Dal chief and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had demanded a CBI probe into the deal.

2,HC asks govt to maintain law and order in S Gujarat,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court, in an interim oral order on Monday, has asked the state government to take all necessary steps to maintain law and order in those areas of South Gujarat where tension prevails on the eve of Christmas.

Notices were also issued to the government along with the district collectors of Dangs, Dahod and Surat following a petition filed by the All-India Christian Council (AICC). The notices were issued by Justice CK Buch and are returnable on December 26 when the matter will come up for hearing again. The AICC had filed a Special Civil Application in the HC after rumours of the VHP and other anti-Christian organisations attempting to harass the community members during the festive Christmas season.

â€œThe areas where Christians reside were marked by massive rallies and meetings,â€� said AICCâ€™s Samson Christ in a release, adding that â€œthese outfits have tried to belittle and harass the minority in every possible wayâ€�. On Sunday at Pareva village of Dahod district, loud speakers were also used without permission by these elements, said Samson. On Tuesday, at Dolara village of Surat district a rally was organised by the VHP and anti-Christian leaflets were freely distributed,â€� he added.

Alleging that a huge number of adivasis from the state were being led into Maharashtra with a massive preparation afoot to disturb the communal atmosphere of the neighbouring state also, Samson said, â€œInnocent adivasis were being exploited against their own brethren in the effort.â€�

Claiming that the entire Christian society were feeling insecure and disturbed by the cold-shouldered attitude of the state and its machinery being used against Christians, the AICC in its petition, has requested that the areas where such activities were being carried out should be sealed.

3,VHP to defy ban on reconversion rally,"MUMBAI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has decided to go ahead with its reconversion rally at Nawapur in the tribal district of Nandurbar on Wednesday despite a ban by the Maharashtra government.

On Monday, the state government had invoked prohibitory orders in Nawapur banning assembly of more than four persons. It also banned VHP leader Pravin Togadiaâ€”the chief guest at the rallyâ€”from entering Nawapur.

VHP state convener Shankar Gaikar said that Mr Togadia and a large contingent of Hindutva activists would attend the rally on Wednesday on schedule.

He further said that it was not a reconversion rally as was touted by the minority community but a â€œjagran sabha for which they did not need the state governmentâ€™s permissionâ€™â€™. The district administration, meanwhile, has summoned additional forces for assistance and also requisitioned the State Reserve Police Force personnel to ensure that no law and order problem arises in Nawapur on Wednesday.

According to the local police officials, the guard has been raised after 20 Christians were attacked by alleged Bajrang Dal activists in Bhendgwahn village in Nashik district on Monday night when they were having Christmas prayers. In fact, the State Minorities Commission had expressed concern over the timing of the rally on Christmas eve to the government a fortnight ago.

4,Hizbul link in ammunition haul arrested,"KOLKATA: The last missing pieces in the AK-47 ammo haul are falling into place. Farhad Mehmood, a Hijbul Mujahiddin linkman, was arrested from a yet unspecified location in Jammu and Kashmir by the state''s police on December 16. Farhad was the Kolkata agent in the arms deal.

A Kolkata Police team has left for J&K to try and get Farhad on transit remand to Kolkata. Farhad, who is particularly close to the Hizb splinter group Hamat-ul-Mujahiddin, had slipped out of Kolkata as his aides (including footballer Abid Imam) fell into the police net. His detention is a shot in the arm for the city police.

Inputs from central intelligence agencies, who are closely monitoring the probe into the September 3 ammunition haul in Kolkata, led to Farhad''s arrest.

Though sleuths are yet to pin down the outfit for whom Farhad bought the 25,000 7.62 calibre bullets, they are certain that he had close links with terrorist groups. He had paid Rs 3.9 lakh for the ammunition, sources said. Unknown to the police, Farhad lived in a Haji Mohsin Square home for years and worked for a Sreeram Arcade shopowner.

With his arrest â€” and the triple arrests by Meghalaya police from East Garo Hills on November 30 â€” the cops have tracked down most of the fugitives. Their interrogation holds the key to the case, sleuths say. DC (DD-Special) Damayanti Sen refused to give out any information before Farhad is brought to Kolkata.

5,Sharma's lawyer demands to see cassette,"PUNE: Taking objection to the showing of a video cassette to special judge S.M. Shembole, defence counsel Vijay Nahar, representing former police commissioner Ranjit Singh Sharma in the court, demanded that the material used by the prosecution be made available to the defence too.

This point was put forward by Nahar when the bail application of Sharma, arrested in connection with the fake stamp scam, came up for hearing on Tuesday. Nahar strongly objected to the special investigation teamâ€™s (SIT) move of showing the cassette, which was related to Sharma, to the judge.

However, the cassette will not be shown to the defence as the SIT has termed it as sensitive material. The court ordered the prosecution to file a say on the matter and the case would come up for hearing on January 1. The application moved by Nahar said since the SIT was using the cassette to oppose the bail, and if the defence was denied access to the same, it amounts to violation of the principles of justice.

Nahar said the prosecution was trying to influence the court and since the cassette was important in deciding the bail plea, it was proper to show it to the defence. Meanwhile, judicial magistrate first class M.N. Bondre on Tuesday remanded kingpin Abdul Karim Telgiâ€™s aide, Vijay Desai, to police custody till January 6. The prosecution told the court that Desai had links with Delhi police inspector Puran Singh, who has been arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation, and with Telgiâ€™s absconding nephew, Tabrez.

6,Telgi had links with 3 ministers,"BANGALORE: During narco-analysis tests being conducted on him, Abdul Karim Telgi, prime accused in the multi-crore stamp paper racket, revealed on Monday that he maintained links with two ministers from Karnataka and another senior one from Maharashtra through associates.

Telgi, who was subjected to questioning under a â€˜truth serumâ€™ at the Victoria hospital, also stated that he made pay-offs to these top contacts through his associates, sources close to the narco-analysis process revealed on the condition of anonymity.

The man, whose stamp paper racket has had ramifications across the country, said he was close to â€œtop bureaucrats and police officersâ€� everywhere he operated. He spoke about personal links with an assistant commissioner of police in Bangalore as well, the sources said. Telgi was subjected to the narco-analysis test after a Pune court granted investigators permission to conduct three types of forensic tests on seven prime accused in the racket.

Those associated with the nearly three-hourlong test have claimed satisfaction with the outcome of the questioning, where â€œTelgiâ€™s inhibitions were sufficiently blunted using an anaestheticâ€�. Experts from the Bangalore forensic science lab used a questionnaire prepared by the Maharashtra and Karnataka police to direct questions at Telgi as he sat in a relaxed, but lowered state of consciousness.

â€œHe consented to taking the test and answered nearly 70 per cent of the questions freely. He was not very forthcoming on some questions with replies like â€˜itâ€™s against my principlesâ€™,â€� the sources said. Telgi reportedly denied having links with extremists and the underworld. He was also not forthcoming on questions about where he had deposited money earned through the racket.

Telgi, however, revealed details of some properties held by him, including complexes and theatres in Bangalore, and claimed to have been cheated in some deals by partners, the sources said. Although the results of the test cannot be used as evidence in court, investigators are hoping to use the information revealed by Telgi to gather more evidence and strengthen their case.

7,Left to observe Bihar bandh on January 7,"PATNA: All India Studentsâ€™ Association (Aisa), Inquilabi Naujwan Sabha (INS) and All India Progressive Womenâ€™s Association (Aipwa) jointly announced here on Tuesday that they would launch an agitation in the state on December 28 to change the government and observe Bihar bandh on January 7, 2004, to register their protest against the corrupt government.

Talking to mediapersons, Aisa secretary Abhyudaya, Aipwa secretary Shashi Yadav and INS president Kamlesh Sharma said that the fate of the state could not be changed until the ruling party is removed from power. In pursuance of their programme, the youth leaders said, a â€œBadlo Bihar Sangharsh Yatraâ€� would be taken out in different parts of the state on December 28. The day has been selected to commemorate the first anniversary of Ashiana Nagar episode.

They said that criminal-politician-police nexus in the state has virtually stopped growth for the past 13-14 years. People are living in a suffocating atmoshphere while the graph of kidnapping, murder, loot and rape is going northward. The Laloo-Rabri combine was not at all bothered about the development of the state; rather, they are concerned only with clinging to power.

8,"Short winter break for government, MCD schools","NEW DELHI: Public school students may enjoy extended winter vacations this year, but a harsh January lies ahead for students of government and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) schools.

While most public schools have opted to remain closed at least till the first week of January, directorate and MCD schools have only a week-long winter break. Both will close on December 25 and are to reopen on December 31, with January 1 being an optional restricted holiday.

Government school teachers say they are open to the idea of extending winter break, and compensating the holidays by reducing summer vacations. â€˜â€˜It is quite sensible to extend winter break and cut down on summer vacations. We have raised the matter a number of times but there is no thought being given to studentsâ€™ plight,â€™â€™ said government school teachersâ€™ association (GSTA), general secretary, DK Tiwari.

Directorate officials say any decision on issue can only be taken by the government.

â€˜â€˜The option of altering or extending the break period depending on the weather is a viable one. The decision, however, rests exclusively with the government,â€™â€™ said education director, Rajendra Kumar.

The winter problem is even more severe for MCD schools as they deal with only primary classes. â€˜â€˜Visibility reduces in winters and mornings are exceptionally foggy in January. Classrooms in many schools donâ€™t even have window glass. Making students sit in such hostile conditions is a sheer torture,â€™â€™ said Mithlesh Azad, a teacher at an MCD primary school in west Delhi.

MCD officials say they are bound by the directorateâ€™s orders and cannot draw up a schedule suitable to their students.

10,BJP does not rule out advancing LS polls,"HYDERABAD: Not fully ruling out the possibility to advance Lok Sabha elections, the BJP on Wednesday said it was seeking feedback from its state units on ""which month is suitable"" for elections and asking the cadre to be ""ready"" to win 300 seats if polls are held earlier.

""The government can take any decision.... As of now, we have asked the cadre to gear up for achieving the target of 300 seats in 250 days. If it (election) is advanced, the target can be, say, 125 days-300 seats,"" BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu told reporters here.

A meeting of BJP''s national executive, scheduled to be held here on January 11-12, would ""decide on the timing of polls after taking feedback from state units on which month is suitable weatherwise,"" he said.

Asserting that no decision has been taken so far on advancing elections, he dropped hints that his party was leaving some room for such a possibility.

Evading a direct reply to a question whether he was ruling out the possibility of early Lok Sabha polls, he quipped: ""I am not proposing that... where is the question of opposing it"".

Invoking cricketing jargon, Naidu said: ""The party cadre should be prepared to achieve the target in, so to say, 125 balls also.""
