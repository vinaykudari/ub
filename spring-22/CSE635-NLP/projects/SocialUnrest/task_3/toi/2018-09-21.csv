0,Jharkhand govt clears 73% job reservation,"ranchi: the jharkhand cabinet on thursday passed the much-awaited policy on reservation in state government jobs, reserving up to 73 per cent for the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backward classes. the reservation limit - probably the highest in the country - has been set in accordance with the directives of the supreme court, which has fixed 50 per cent as reservation limit with exception to extremely backward states. the cabinet approved most of the recommendations of its sub-committee - headed by welfare minister arjun munda - set up in may to work out the modalities of the policy. however, instead of the 12 per cent reservation limit for the scheduled castes as recommended by the sub-committee, the cabinet decided to have a 14 per cent limit. the reservation limit for the scheduled tribes has been fixed at 32 per cent while for the backward and extremely backward classes it has been set at 9 and 18 per cent respectively. the government would send a request to the union government to provide constitutional protection to the provisions of the policy by including it in the ninth schedule of the constitution. in another significant decision to accord priority in jobs to local people the cabinet adopted the domicile policy of bihar government - resolution adopted in 1982 - by which the survey record of rights and ownership would be the yardstick for determining local residents for recruitment in the defence services and appointments in the districts. domicile certificates will be issued to those fulfilling two of the following conditions - (a) person or persons' parents residing in the districts for the last 10 years, (b) person should be hindi-speaking, and (c) should have immoveable property in the state. the reservation policy is likely to stir a hornet's nest once again in the state with tribal outfits already staging demonstrations in support of their demand for 60 per cent reservation for the scheduled tribes. as a precautionary measure security has been beefed up in the state capital.

2,"Row over selection of flood, drought-hit blocks","saharsa: the bihar government has come under sharp criticism for its alleged irrational and arbitrary categorisation of flood and drought-hit blocks. the declaration of six blocks as drought-hit and only one block as flood-affected, thus ignoring claims of three out of ten blocks in the district, has triggered a row here as the people of these three blocks namely saharsa, sour bazaar and sonbarsa would be deprived of the special relief measures likely to come from the state government. the issue led to pandemonium at the recent meeting of the district monitoring committee on flood and drought relief and the district magistrate, d s gangwar, who was presiding over the meeting in the absence of the minister in charge (of 20-point programme) sita ram singh, was compelled to direct the agriculture department to conduct a fresh survey of saharsa, sour bazaar and sonbarsa. gangwar assured agitated mukhiyas, block pramukhs and representatives of various political parties of the inclusion of the said blocks in the list of the drought-hit ones on receipt of a directive from the state government. some of the members accused the district agriculture department officials of furnishing fake reports of kharif coverage to the state government. the state government's relief and rehabilitation department has declared 357 blocks in the state as 'abhaao-grast' (i.e. distressed areas) due to less rainfall and floods. the list includes seven blocks of saharsa district out of which nawhatta, simri bakhtiarpur, banama, salkhua, patarghat and sattar kataiya blocks have been categorised as drought-hit whereas only one block, mahishi, has been declared flood-hit. the state government in its circular has instructed the respective dms to launch suitable measures to protect the standing crops, initiate alternate farming and provide employment and relief to the needy ones. it is indeed surprising for the common man here how mahishi alone has been listed as a flood-hit block whereas nawhatta, salkhua and banama blocks which have almost the same geographical conditions and have experienced identical rainfall this year, have come under the drought-hit category. major parts of these blocks situated in the womb of the rapacious kosi river, face large-scale erosion and damage to standing crops. similarly, one wonders how the rainfall index varied in sattar kataiya and its neighbouring saharsa. if farmers of sattar kataiya block could not sow paddy seeds in their fields due to the shortage of rainfall, how their counterparts in saharsa block managed to do that in the exactly similar geographical and monsoon conditions, the people wondered. the pick and choose method allegedly adopted by the state government has given birth to many speculations in the political circles here. whereas the rjd mla from mahishi, abdul gaffoor, has succeeded in getting both the blocks of his constituency (mahishi as flood-hit and nawhatta as drought-hit) enlisted, his counterpart in sonbarsa, ashok kumar singh, who is also a cabinet minister, has suffered a setback as two blocks of his assembly constituency namely sour and sonbarsa have been deprived of the special relief package likely to come from the government in near future. the lone congress mla from simri bakhtiarpur, choudhary mehboob ali kaisar, minister of state for science and technology, has won accolades from his people as all the three blocks of this constituency have been declared as drought-hit. the former finance minister and dissident leader, shankar prasad tekriwal, is also unhappy as a major part of his constituency i.e. saharsa would be a definite loser. ironically, the local leaders of different political parties have raised their voices against the alleged negligence towards their areas, the mlas and the ministers have preferred silence due to political compulsions. jd-u mp dinesh chandra yadav when contacted by this correspondent expressed ignorance over the government's yardstick in declaring flood and drought-hit blocks and remarked tersely, ""what is the use of such announcements when everyone knows the state government is not giving any relief to the victims.""

3,Elections a launchpad for political career,"chandigarh: are these candidates for students' elections aspiring leaders or are here just to be a part of the frenzy? with scholars' elections soon to take place, the general view is that many of the student leaders consider college elections as an opportunity for launching themselves in politics. the political family background of these leaders is another incentive for them to leap into this field. agrees karamveer singh, a chandigarh students' union( csu) candidate, aspiring for the vice-president's post, whose father had been president of the chandigarh municipal corporation. ''family background in politics shapes your interest in this field,'' he says. for gurpervez, former president, dav college, sector 10, these elections will provide him with a launchpad for contesting the assembly elections from guru sai constituency in ferozepur district. upkar singh, presidential candidate from government college, sector 46, is also banking on college elections for improving his political prospects. ''the contacts one builds up at this stage, help later in the political career.'' but there are many who disagree. ''college elections are not very political,'' says balwinder singh dhaliwal from dav college, sector 10, adding that universitylevel candidates are the ones aspiring for the posts. academically, the students who take part in the elections are mostly from arts stream, followed by commerce . ''science students and those in professional courses do not have the time for elections,'' says feroz, the sopu candidate from government college, sector 46.toppers also keep away from elections. ''position holders are nominated to students' council, so they need not take part in elections,'' says a c vaid, principal, ggdsd college, sector 32.

5,No review of Global investments: MS,"new delhi: global software giant microsoft will not review its worldwide investment and product launch decisions following the terrorist attack in the us. ""we will not cut down on any of our earlier investments and product and services launch decisions as the recent air strikes in the us has not altered any of our business plans,"" said mark phibbs, general manager (business development, asia region), microsoft. he said the company would go ahead with its proposed global launch of windows xp operating systems on october 25 this year, while the indian launch would be on october 28. microsoft has earmarked $500 million for sales and marketing push of windows xp launch, phibbs said, adding a significant portion of this would be kept aside for indian launch. on the likely impact of us air strikes last week, he said software product business would not see as much surge in demand as pcs, hardware and services would. ""pc and hardware replenishments will be the key drivers to demand, while software from companies like ours will not see as much growth as they are licensed products,"" phibbs added. he said the global investment decisions were taken in line with the company's performance in terms of net profits, sales and income. ""from that consideration, microsoft is on an excellent track, we are forging ahead with our projected figures."" phibbs said the company was likely to meet its projected revenue of $6 billion in the first quarter of the fiscal 2002 ending september 30. in india, he said, microsoft would proceed along the partnership programme with companies like infosys and undertake projects to work with governments. placing india at an advantageous position vis-a-vis china, he said it was time for india now to move beyond services. ""to move into the products segment, india needs to increase r&d spendings and strenghthen its intellectual property rights to protect licensed products,"" he said. globally, microsoft spends $5 billion per annum on r&d.

7,Jaswant rules out talks with Pakistan,"new delhi: india on friday night virtually ruled out any talks with pakistan in the near future. external affairs minister jaswant singh told a late night press conference that the situation has ""transformed beyond recognition"" because of the terrorist strikes in the us and islamabad is ""preoccupied"" with it.

""the prime minister has clearly said that at the present moment there is no prospect of talks with pakistan,"" said singh, replying to questions raised about the prime minister's remarks to this newspaper, clarifying the talks were off only for now. in the present circumstances, ""it is simply not practical to talk about parleys between the leadership of the two countries,"" he stressed. replying to a question, singh said no meeting between the leaders of the two countries was scheduled at the moment.

8,BJP for urban bodies' polls on party basis,"patna: the bjp on thursday demanded reservation for the scheduled castes (scs), other backward castes (obcs) and women in the elections to the posts of mayor and deputy mayor of the five municipal corporations of the state. it has suggested to the government to hold urban bodies elections on party basis besides demanding direct election to the posts of mayor and deputy mayor of municipal corporations and chairman and vice-chairman of municipalities and notified area committees (nacs). talking to mediapersons here, state bjp chief nand kishore yadav said that it was surprising that the government had provided reservation for the scheduled castes and women in the elections to the posts of chairman and vice-chairman of 32 municipalities and 77 nacs, but had not done so for elections to the posts of mayor and deputy mayor of the municipal corporations. nand kishore yadav also charged the government with adopting a casual approach towards the suggestions by different political parties, including the bjp, for amendments in the patna municipal corporation act, bihar municipal act and the draft election rules. a bjp delegation led by him submitted a memorandum to the urban development minister srinarayan yadav on thursday, suggesting amendments in the two acts and the rules. besides suggesting amendment in the procedure to reserve wards for women and scs, the delegation demanded reservation for obcs and extremely backward castes in the polls. the state bjp supremo also severely criticised the government for bringing down the number of municipalities in the state to 32 from the existing 50 and reducing the number of nacs by 13. he said that the delimitation of municipal corporations, municipalities and nacs' wards should have been done on the basis of latest census or the voters' list for the last assembly elections. he said the government plea that the report of the 2001 census was yet to be published officially was untenable. nand kishore also asked the government to explain why it had lowered the status of 13 nacs to that of panchayats. he sought to know from the government when will it would hold the elections to these 13 panchayats.

10,Oppn to grill govt on short session,"patna: once again, a session of the bihar legislature, scheduled to begin from september 24, is ""short"" with just three working days. already, the opposition parties are charging the government with holding the assembly session just to meet its constitutional obligations. with important issues such as floods and drought facing the state, both houses should have had at least 10 sitting days. ""it is holding the session just to uphold a formality,"" charged leader of the opposition in the assembly sushil kumar modi. the state government, however, is citing the ""grand introduction of grassroots democracy"" in bihar from october 2. ""we have a mega event on october 2 when grassroots democracy will take a rebirth in bihar. i am sure that mlas would like to actively participate in the meeting called for all newly elected members of the panchayati raj,"" said parliamentary affairs minister ram chandra purbey. he said that a longer session of the house could be held in december. purbey said the first supplementary budget would be presented in the house. ""there are also a few bills to be moved in the house,"" he said, insisiting that the government is ready to hold discussions on important issues like flood and drought facing the state. ""i will appeal to all mlas that the time of the legislature is important. they should use every moment,"" he added. however, despite parliamentary affair minister's plea and the house session being short, both the state legislative assembly and the council may witness their ususal fireworks. modi has indicated that he is working on floor co-ordination with other opposition parties on bringing an adjournment motion on the aurai firing and massacre of dalits in mataurha and duttmai villages. ""we are going to press for the arrest of jainandan yadav, the main acccussed of the two carnages. he remains at large even after a month,"" stressed modi, indicating that the opposition is out to grill the state government in the house on the alleged patronisation of jainandan yadav by a rjd minister. besides, the state government faces an agitated opposition over poor and patchy work over relief and rehabilitation work for the flood victims. hayaghat mla umadhar prasad singh, who supports the rabri government in the house, has threatened to stage a dharna before the speaker's chamber on poor distribution of relief material in his constituency causing an embarrassment to speaker sadanand singh. other mlas representing flood-hit areas are also expected to air their resentment on the same issue. the government is likely to ward off these criticism by puting the blame on the centre's alleged neglect of the state.
