0,JNU elections begin Nov 8,"NEW DELHI: The left criticises the right as well as the extreme-left. The right, in turn, flays the left and the extreme-left. And those in the centre lambast everyone else. Surprised? Don''t be, it''s election time after all.

The battle lines for the November 8 elections in the Jawaharlal Nehru University student''s union (JNUSU) have been clearly drawn, with the campaigning starting Saturday.

In all, 24 students from different political outfits are in the fray for the four JNUSU posts. Around 75 others will battle it out for the posts of councillors from various schools and student representatives on the Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment. The campus issues remain, more or less, the same for all the outfits in the fray. Among them are demands for increased scholarships, better library, Internet and transport facilities, along with communalisation and commercialisation of the campus.

But JNU will not be the same if national and international issues are not debated, with fiery attacks on each other''s ideologies.

""The NDA government is the most servile government...there have been attempts to implement policies of privatisation and saffronisation...we will work for improving financial assistance to students among other things,"" Albeena Shakeel of the leftist combine of Students'' Federation of India and All India Students'' Federation (SFI-AISF), said.

The SFI-AISF is fielding Rohit (president), Parimal Maya Sudhakar (vice-president), Shamshad Ahmad Khan (general secretary) and Ena Panda (joint secretary). Shiv Shakti Nath Bakshi, presidential candidate of the right-wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), in turn, said: ""The leftist parties have been unsuccessful in fulfilling the mandate given by students...We got better transport facilities for students,"" Bakshi said.

Raj Moni Borah (vice-president), Vivekanand Upadhyay (general secretary) and Amit Singh (joint secretary) are the other ABVP candidates.

The Congress-affiliated National Students'' Union of India (NSUI) has fielded Chandan Kumar for the president''s post. ""We will take up issues of secular and liberal nationalism, the destruction of our higher education system and the need for an assertive foreign policy,"" Kumar said.

The other NSUI candidates are Duryodhana Ketki (vice-president), Prem Chand (general secretary) and Surjeet Singh Panwar (joint secretary).

Radhika Menon, presidential candidate of the extreme-left All India Students'' Association (AISA), in turn, said: ""The SFI-led JNUSU ignored serious policy offensives like seat cuts and dilly-dallied on raising the issue of the X plan.""

Others in the fray on AISA''s behalf are Inteshar Ahmad (vice-president), Mahendra Prakash (general secretary) and R John Suresh Kumar (joint secretary).

The Chattra Lok Janshakti, in its turn, has also fielded the entire panel, with Joginder Singh Meena as the presidential candidate. Others are: Amit Kumar Singh (vice-president), Mrinal Pingua (general secretary) and Md Nurul Islam (joint secretary).

1,State government slashes slum charges,"PUNE: In an apparent bid to appease slum-dwellers, the Democratic Front government has slashed the slum improvement charges (SIC) by 50 per cent in the state. The decision comes as a big blow to municipal corporations across the state as it would mean a major loss in the range of Rs 50 crore to Rs 200 crore by way of SIC collections. The Pune municipal corporation (PMC) is expected to lose revenue of Rs 42 crore owing to the 50 per cent cut. When contacted, PMC's chief accountant Ambrish Galinde said, in the current budget the corporation had anticipated an income of Rs 80 crore by way of SIC dues for the last seven years. ""However, now the figure may not cross the Rs 40 crore mark,"" he said. The government's decision has brought cheer to the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporators, many of whom have credited Congress MLA Chandrakant Chhajed, who had stressed for reduction in the charges. Till 1995, the PMC was charging Rs 16 per month (Rs 192 per year) as SIC. The monthly charge was hiked to Rs 50 (Rs 600 per year) on January 1, 1995. These charges pertain to huts used as residential purposes. Rates for huts used as commercial purposes are more. There are around 1.5 lakh huts in the city and a majority of them have not paid dues since 1995, after the monthly charge was hiked. Starting this year, the corporations in the state, including the PMC, had introduced a scheme of issuing photo-identity passes to the slumdwellers, provided they pay the SIC dues for the last seven years. Past experience of issuing such passes shows that the slum-dwellers normally clear all the dues to obtain the I-cards. This is because the I-card not only serves the purpose of an address proof, but also gives the much-needed legal status to the slum-dwellers. Hence, the PMC had expected that the slum-dwellers would clear the dues of the last seven years and thereby collect over Rs 80 crore. But its calculations have now gone for a toss. Chhajed showed reporters the copy of the government order which states that all the dues till July 31, 2002, should be charged at the ""old rate"". The old rate of SIC charged by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) was Rs 100 per month. Chhajed had demanded that the PMC be allowed to charge 25 per cent of that rate. That is Rs 25 per month. His demand has been accepted and an order to this effect has been passed by L.D. Vyas, deputy secretary of the state government. Thus, the corporation which was expecting a revenue of Rs 80 crore by way of SIC dues for seven years (at a rate of Rs 50 per month) will now get just around Rs 40 crore (at a rate of Rs 25 per month).

2,UP political scene gets murkier,"LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: With governor Vishnu Kant Shastri refusing to convene a special session of UP Assembly and rebel BJP MLAs spurning the PM''s offer of talks, the political crisis in the state showed no sign of letting up on Saturday.

The Samajwadi Party (SP), meanwhile, intensified efforts to make an alternative arrangement with the Congress'' help.

Shastri said even after the reduced strength, the Mayawati government enjoyed a majority of 210 in a House of 403 and there was no need for a trial of strength as demanded by the rebel Independents.

Shastri said seven of them had voted for the government when it won the confidence vote in May this year with a total of 217 votes.

Responding to Prime Minister Vajpayee''s offer to look into the grievances of the dissidents, suspended MLA Ramashish Rai said all roads to raproachment had been sealed by the state leadership.

However, in a setback to the rebels, Mithilesh Kumar, MLA from Shajahanpur, denied reports that he had withdrawn support to the government.

In New Delhi, the SP got down to the business of enlisting Congress'' support. SP president Mulayam Singh Yadav claimed that the BJP-BSP ruling coalition had been reduced to a minority and demanded that the governor dismiss it. He said about 15 BSP MLAs were in a mood to revolt against Mayawati. Yadav said he along with CPM leader Surjeet Singh Barnalla and SP general secretary Amar Singh would meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi shortly to formally ask for support.

The Congress has 25 MLAs in the state assembly.

Through a series of meetings with senior Congress functionaries, the SP leadership communicated to Sonia a proposal for cooperation elsewhere in lieu of support in UP.

Back from Lucknow, SP general secretary Amar Singh held separate meetings with Manmohan Singh, Motilal Vora, Natwar Singh, Kamal Nath and Ahmed Patel. Singh talked to Surjeet as well.

""The mood for change in Lucknow is so strong that the dissident BJP MLAs are ready to invite disqualification by defying their party leadership to oppose the Mayawati government,"" he later said.

About his talks with the Congress leaders, he made it clear that the SP was willing to extend cooperation to the main Opposition party as much in the Gujarat elections as on other issues if the latter backed the SP bid for power. ""The route to Gujarat is through UP,"" Singh remarked claiming that the fall of the Mayawati government would constitute a severe setback for alliance partner BJP as well. Hinting at further cooperation he said his party had no objection to Sonia''s candidature for prime ministership in future and would not raise the issue of her foreign origins.

""She has been recognised as the leader of opposition by everybody including Prime Minister Vajpayee, and the Supreme Court has put to rest the issue of her foreign roots,"" he said. He claimed that Manmohan Singh had reacted favourably to the SP position in UP.

3,Seamen’s union stages protest against PF scam,"MUMBAI: A large number of seamen employed on Indian and foreign flag ships along with the National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI) staged a demonstration outside the office of the director general of shipping and the office of the commissioner of the seamenâ€™s provident fund on Friday.

The union demanded that the government replenish the money owed to seamen because the ongoing CBI inquiry into the Rs 100-crore seamenâ€™s provident fund scam would take a long time.â€�There are many retired seamen who have not yet got their provident fund money. Their families are suffering,â€™â€™ general secretary of the NUSI Abdulgani Serang said.

â€œWhen the government could bail out the Unit Trust of India of Rs 14,000 crore, which was not even a statutory requirement, the seafarers have a legal right which they are demanding,â€™â€™ Mr Serang said.

4,City’s motorists ride roughshod over carriage-era road law,"MUMBAI: In 1897, the first car rolled majestically onto the cobbled streets of Bombay, owned by a gentleman named Mr Foster, an employee of Greaves Cotton and Company. Until then, there were only horse carriages and bullock carts.

Four years later, Jamshetji Tata became the first Indian to own a car. Even in 1897, the law for rash driving was outdated. Framed in 1870â€”a good three decades before the advent of the car in Indiaâ€”the notorious Section 304 A of the Indian Penal Code was meant to catch up with carriages. Itâ€™s hard to find a more classic example of putting the car before the horse. In 2002, the same law miraculously survives, its 19th century glory regularly rammed by fast Mercs and zippy Zens.The worthies who framed the law had no idea that the cityâ€™s roads would one day be commandeered by a murder of motors which the supreme court has described as â€œdeath trapsâ€™â€™.

About 250 new â€œdeath trapsâ€™â€™ are added to Mumbaiâ€™s roads every day, and 500 people die in road accidents every year. The punishment, as in 1870, is still a mere two-year imprisonment, turning the law itself into a gaping loophole. After all,when the fine you pay for killing a person is less than your pub bill, thereâ€™s something rotten about the law. A c t iv i s t s hope that the Salman Khan p i s o d e â€” which has prompted public interest litigation seeking revision of this archaic lawâ€”will be the catalyst for tougher motor law. Only then will it act as a speed breaker, and not an irksome pothole that can be easily skirted. C r i m i n a l lawyer Majeed Memon has pointed out that it is ridiculous that drunken driving is treated like ticketless travel, spitting or jaywalking.

And when asked to cite a case where the punishment was stringent enough to act as a deterrent, public prosecutor R.V. Kini says, â€œI canâ€™t think of a single case. Salman Khanâ€™s case, in which part II of Section 304 has been applied (culpable homicide not amounting murder), is the first.â€™â€™ Although Mumbaiâ€™s famed road discipline is much-touted plus of the city, there are disturbing signs that it is unravelling. A burgeoning population, vanishing pavements, sloppy parking, flyovers without subways, a mobile-phone driving culture, a corrupt RTO which hands out licences to kill and flashes road rage form ingredients for a perfect Molotov cocktail. Not surprisingly, on average, one Mumbaikar dies in accidents every day and three are maimed. Statistics show that superbrats, brash tribe fuelled by money and tanked alcohol, are among the main contributors to drunken driving mishaps. In the nine days following the Salman Khan accident, 763 motorists were booked for drunken driving, many them youngsters.

â€œYou just have to stroll down Worli seaface, Carter Road, Juhu or Marine Drive to see way these brats drive. Itâ€™s frightening,â€™â€™ says lawyer Niteen Pradhan. Mr Pradhanâ€™s contention is that since these youngsters have not had a proper upbringing, the state should use the Mental Health Act to initiate corrective m e a s u r e â€œGeorge Bushâ€™s niece was admitted to a corrective centre for treatment after a bout of drunken driving,â€™â€™ he says. â€œ called parole. Here too,we need a therapeutic approach to penology. Supplying hopeless quality dal and roti isnâ€™t going to help.â€™â€™

5,Delimitation of seats: HP ministers to meet Advani,"CHANDIGARH: Over a dozen Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) from Himachal Pradesh, including six ministers in the Prem Kumar Dhumal government, have decided to meet Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Lal Krishan Advani and the party high command leaders to convey their indignation against the manner in which de-limitation of assembly seats, is being recommended in the state.

The ministers and legislators, majority of whom owe allegiance to union minister for rural development Shanta Kumar, have come together on one platform to oppose the move to reduce the representation of the politically important, Kangra district of HP, in the state assembly.

The de-limitation committee of the state has recommended that the legislative seats in Kangra be reduced from 16 to 15. It has made recommendations on reserving certain constituencies which will affect these ministers and legislators.

The committee has recommended that Sulah assembly segment be abolished. This seat was represented twice earlier by Shanta Kumar, former chief minister of HP, himself.

Incidentally, the meeting of these BJP ministers and legislators took place in the city, when union minister Shanta Kumar, was also here on Saturday. Some of the ministers and the Kangra district BJP president as well as sitting MLA, Dulo Ram, met Shanta Kumar to express discontentment over the de-limitation process.

BJP leaders pointed out that the de-limitation was being done at the behest of the state government, sources said.

Among the HP ministers present here were transport minister Krishen Kapoor, agriculture minister Vidya Sagar, irrigation minister Ramesh Dhawala, ministers of state Rajan Sushant and Ravinder Ravi, parliamentary secretary Sarveen Chaudhary and MLAs Vipin Parmar, Rakesh Pathania, Atma Ram, Des Raj and Nirmala Devi.

The ministers and legislators are proceeding to New Delhi on Sunday to meet BJP leader Arun Jaitley, DPM Advani and Shanta Kumar, besides, other members of Parliament from the state.

They will also make a representation to the De-limitation Commission against the recommendations. The commission will meet on October 30 in Delhi to decide on the recommendations.

6,Lavish spending by candidates in CSC polls,"CHANDIGARH: The amount of money, men, material and vehicles notwithstanding, Panjab University (PU) has not put any ceiling on the expenditure by students and student organisations contesting in the elections for the campus students council (CSC) this year.

The CSC polls, to be held on November 1, will be one of the most costly in recent years and already, there have been noises on how the student organisations, were able to fund such an expensive exercise.

The students organisations are not really bothered about funds. All the leading ones, PU Students Union (PUSU), Students of PU (SOPU) and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), were out on the campus with a bang on Friday, just hours after the delayed CSC elections were announced by university authorities.

Leaders of these organisations are not ready to acknowledge the background of their funding on record. The official line that all groups maintain is that the money comes from â€˜â€˜contributionsâ€� from students. However, there has been no such campaign by the organisations to collect funds from the student community on the campus.

Powerful senators, having a clear stake in student politics to keep university authorities on their toes, have been accused in the past of openly funding particular student groups. The local police recently even alleged that, senator Gopal Krishan Chatrath, was supporting the SOPU.

The leaders also claim that the â€˜â€˜contributionsâ€� are not in cash alone. This could also mean lending vehicles for campaigning and using contacts to sponsor posters and other material, free meals and of course, a steady flow of liquor during the period of campaigning. PUâ€™s dean-student welfare Nirmal Singh admits that the university has never thought of imposing any ceiling on expenditure by students. He admits that the elections now have become a costly affair and no group is shying from spending money. â€˜â€˜In our time the expenses were less but now students want to do everything,â€� he pointed out. He added that there is no move to impose any ceiling this time either.

The spending by various groups is quite evident. Hundreds of cars and other vehicles, pasted with fluorescent stickers and posters, arrangements for meals for activists, arranging petrol for vehicles, arranging liquor and other miscellaneous expenses shows just where the money is being put to use.

7,No threat to govt: Ajit Singh,"LUCKNOW: Amidst reports of an undercurrent of dissent in the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) over continuing party support to the coalition government, Union minister for agriculture and RLD chief Ajit Singh called on chief minister Mayawati on Saturday evening.

He ruled out speculations that a large chunk of RLD legislature party was walking out of RLD with Samarpal Singh, who was suspended from the party on Friday. He said whoever had the numbers should produce it. Closeted with the CM for an hour, Ajit Singh reportedly assured the CM of the RLDâ€™s â€œunstinted and continued support to her governmentâ€�.

Later in the day, facing a volley of questions from mediapersons about the growing discontent in his party for its ties with the BSP, Singh ruled out any â€œbrewing discontentâ€� in his party and, instead, blamed it on the figment of imagination of the media.

Refusing to divulge the details of his meeting with Mayawati, Singh tried to underplay the political overtones to the meeting and said that he had come to town to take up the issue of sugarcane growers and the sugar mills which had been hanging fire for sometime now.

Asked pointedly on the speculation that his party legislators were on the â€˜hitlistâ€™ of the Samajwadi Party, Singh said in half jest how this issue had become an endless saga of UP politics. â€œWhen we were just eight MLAâ€™s, no effort to break us could succeed, how is it possible now?â€� he wondered aloud.

Differing from public posturing of the party president, insiders in the RLD conceded that â€œsidelining of the Harit Pradesh issue and suspension of party MLA Samarpal Singh did not ordain well for the partyâ€�. While Samarpal Singh stayed in Meerut throughout the day, his close aides said the RLD legislator had already established contact with the SP. When contacted, SP general secretary Amar Singh conceded of â€œwarming up to the RLD rebelsâ€�.

8,NHRC posers make govt look the other way,"PATNA: Annoyed by the political interference in police work, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked for a CBI probe into the controversial case of murder of a CPM worker in Samastipur district in January this year.

Taking cognisance of a complaint filed by one Balram Jha alleging that the Samastipur police under the pressure of a local political heavyweight falsely chargesheeted innocent persons in the case of murder of CPM worker Vishwanath Mahto, the NHRC chairman, Justice J S Verma, on Wednesday pulled up state officials for playing in the hands of politicians at the cost of innocent citizens.

Maintaining that the then Samastipur SP Paresh Saxena too had corroborated the charges made by Jha, a visibly annoyed Justice Verma, sources said, remarked that it is indeed a sorry state of affairs when not only the available documents but also a senior police officer drop enough hints of political interference in police work. According to the sources, the case (13/2002) of the Bibhutipur police station of Samastipur named as many as 14 accused and the investigating officer (IO) filed chargesheets against 13 of them even before the SPâ€™s â€œReport IIâ€� in the case was issued. In fact, the IO filed the chargesheets only hours before the SP released his â€œReport IIâ€�.

â€œNormally, it is only after the issuing of the SPâ€™s â€˜Report IIâ€™ that a chargesheet is filed in any case,â€� a police officer said. Ironically, while the accusation against at least nine of the accused appeared to be untrue in the SPâ€™s report for want of sufficient evidence, the IO, in his probe report, found the accusation to be true. While the case brought to the fore the messy affairs of the Samastipur police, a well-wisher of the accused, Jha, moved the NHRC. The commission called for a report from Saxena and he spilled the beans. â€œThe SP virtually raised his hands, admitting Jhaâ€™s allegations as also political interference,â€� one of the police officers attending the NHRC proceedings said. Saxenaâ€™s report to the NHRC also mentioned that he was unceremoniously shifted out of the district within 10 days of issuing of his â€œReport IIâ€� for his refusal to oblige the politician who wanted to implicate his rivals in the case. â€œWhy did you transfer Saxena?â€� Justice Verma was quoted as having tersely asked an IG-rank official who tried to put the blame on Saxena for the â€œmessâ€�. The state officials, sources said, also looked the other way when the NHRC chief sought to know why Saxenaâ€™s successor and his seniors did not use the powers provided by Section 173 of the CrPC to reinvestigate the case in the light of Saxenaâ€™s findings recorded in his â€œReport IIâ€� as early as six months ago.

â€œInvestigation by an agency independent of local controlâ€� is needed, the NHRC team, including its DG Y N Srivastava, is learnt to have told the state government. Incidentally, Saxenaâ€™s transfer had raised many an eyebrow. Saxena was singled out for transfer despite his having been a successful SP in that the number of cognisable offences had come down during his one-year tenure in 2001 according to reports from Samastipur. Saxena, who was posted as AIG (railway) after waiting for posting for about three months, could not be contacted as he was said to be away in Kolkata. A senior official in the home department, however, said, â€œThe NHRC is only a recommending body and I doubt that the government will accept its recommendations.â€�

9,Bihar minister rejects JSEB claim,"PATNA: Bihar energy minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan on Saturday dismissed the Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) claim that the Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) owes Rs 3,522 crore to it, describing the claim as â€œfalseâ€�.

Talking to TNN here, Khan said the figure quoted by JSEB chairman Rajib Ranjan is bogus as the assets and liabilities are to be divided between the BSEB and JSEB in the ratio of 54:46. The minister said the cabinet committee meeting on Tuesday next would approve the tripartite agreement between the Bihar government, NTPC and RBI regarding the payment of NTPC dues, adding that the committeeâ€™s approval to the agreement would ward off the NTPC threat to â€œregulateâ€� power supply to the BSEB from November 1. He held a meeting of senior Patna Electric Supply Undertaking (Pesu) officials to discuss steps for increasing revenue generation, including payment of power bills.

The meeting was attended by the BSEB chairman, secretary and its two members. Khan aims at registering one lakh commercial consumers of power in urban Patna to mop up a revenue of at least Rs 15 crore a month. At present, 30,000 commercial consumers out of the 45,000 registered ones are paying the power bills amounting to Rs 4.96 crore. The minister issued a directive to the executive engineers of Pesuâ€™s 10 divisions here to have additional 50,000 commercial consumers for the present. This would add Rs 5 crore to the revenue collection, he said.

He said many residential power connections in Patna are being used for commercial purposes, adding that such consumers would be forced to get their connections registered under the commercial category. He directed the engineers to launch a month-long drive against power theft. He asked the energy department to initiate the move for amending the anti-power theft laws in order to make them more stringent. The minister will soon hold a meeting with the home secretary and DGP to give the district administration the responsibility of coordination for the success of BSEB drives for revenue collection and checking power theft.

10,Naik questions inclusion of pump in Centaur Hotel deal,"NEW DELHI: Petroleum Minister Ram Naik has questioned the sale of Centaur Hotel, Mumbai to Batra Hospitality saying prior consent for including an IOC petrol pump in the sale agreement had not been taken.

""Neither disinvestment ministry nor the ministry of civil aviation consulted us and took prior concurrence of IOC before including the retail outlet in the agreement to sell inspite of the fact that it is not the property of HCI,"" Naik said in a letter to Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie.

Naik''s letter assumes significance in the wake of recent controversy over transfer of the pump by Batra Hospitality to Sahara as part of sale of the hotel earlier this month for presumably over Rs 100 crore.

Stating that the retail outlet was built by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) on the land leased to it by the Airport Authority of India, Naik said Hotel Corporation of India (the former owner of Hotel Centaur) was appointed dealer.

Batra Hospitality, which bought Hotel Centaur for Rs 83 crore, cannot claim ownership of the petrol pump, he said, adding, ""as per the memorandum of agreement between IOC and HCI, the dealership cannot be automatically assigned or transferred to a new party.""

Disinvestment ministry has sought handing over of the petrol pump located near the domestic airport, Mumbai to Batra Hospitality on the grounds that HCI had disclosed the dealership agreement with IOC in the schedule to the agreement to sell and it was part of the valuation process.

Following the controversy over ownership of the pump, IOC sealed it while Batra Hospitality filed a suit against IOC in the civil court at Mumbai.

Stating that HCI under Centaur Hotel Mumbai had been operating the petrol pump since 1975, Naik said, ""this petrol pump is owned by IOC and HCI had entered into a dealership agreement for running it.""

He suggested that IOC be allowed to operate the pump till the issue is settled.

The petroleum minister is learnt to have taken exception to putting on sale a property which did not belong to HCI. ""They (disinvestment ministry) never approached us to ascertain the ownership of the pump.""

Meanwhile, senior petroleum ministry officials said the petrol pump, located across the hotel, was a company owned dealer operated (CODO) outlet and HCI was the dealer.

Batra Hospitality has claimed ownership of the petrol pump citing disinvestment ministry''s information memorandum on Centaur Hotel provided during due diligence which said, ""the pump operated by the hotel would be transferred to the new owner of Centaur.""

Disinvestment ministry, on the other hand, contended that hotels normally have restaurants leased to different people. When the company gets taken over by a new management these agreement/rights get transferred to it.

""HCI was only a tenant (on IOC property) and if a property owned by the tenant is taken over by someone, the landlord''s property which he occupies does not get transferred. This is illegal,"" Naik added.

11,RBI to review credit policy on Oct 29,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will carry out a mid-term review of the monetary and credit policy for 2002-03 on Tuesday with a likely reassessment of the projected growth rate of 6-6.5 per cent.

The RBI Governor Bimal Jalan would hold a meeting with the chief executives of major scheduled commercial banks for the review.

The apex bank, in its annual report in August, also stated that it would reassess in the mid-term review the projected growth of 6-6.5 per cent, which was based on assumption of a normal monsoon.

The report had made it clear that a reassessment of the GDP growth would be attempted in October by which time reliable information regarding effects of drought on agricultural and industrial output would be available.

Opinion on a bank rate cut was divided. One view was that a reduction would help boost demand in view of drought and sluggishness in the economy, the other felt RBI may wait for more evidence on this front before resorting to this move.

Analysts felt that a bank rate cut was unlikely now as funds were available at sub-prime lending rate, which in some cases was below 10 per cent.

Analysts said banks were flush with funds and the credit offtake was not as expected as compared to 2001 mainly due to the slowdown in the industrial sector.

RBI, in its annual monetary and credit policy in April, had stated that a 50 basis point reduction may depend on the monetary development. It had, however, not fixed any timing for lowering the bank rate.

Government securities players are expecting a cut in the repo rate (repurchase), which is presently at 5.75 per cent, as there was plenty of liquidity in the market going by the trends witnessed during the recent auctions conducted by the apex bank.

This move, they feel, could also help reduce the rate for short term loans.

RBI had brought down the repo rate by 25 basis points in June 2002.

12,Centre to cooperate with new J&K govt: Advani,"MODASA: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Sunday said the Centre will extend all cooperation to the new Jammu and Kashmir government to be headed by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed to take up the aspects of cross-border terrorism and development.

Talking to reporters here after flagging off new broad gauge railway line between Modasa and Kapavganj, he said ""after stalemate for sometime since the election, it was proper that a popular government take over the charge in the crucial border state"".

For sometime governor''s rule had to be imposed as political parties in the hung assembly could not give a government, he said and added that as per indications made yesterday, a government would soon be sworn-in.

Answering a question, he declined to comment on the regional credentials of PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed saying ""we were in favour of a government at the earliest and I need not comment whichever party comes to power"".

He said that the Centre was keenly awaiting Election Commission''s announcement for polls in Gujarat and hoped that the new government in Gujarat will also take up the twin aspects of security and development.

To a question, Advani denied there was any political crisis in Uttar Pradesh.

13,Army deployment increased liabilities: Fernandes,"NASIK: Stating that Indian army''s liability had increased as it was being deployed to tackle internal problems of the country, Defence Minister George Fernandes on Sunday said it was well equipped and ready to face any eventuality.

With army being called to quell riots, attacks by terrorists and during natural calamities, the government was trying to create separate forces to combat such problems as per the recommendations of the Subramaniam committee, he said.

""But it will take time as it requirs adequate funding,"" Fernandes said while delivering valedictory address at a seminar on science, technology and security of the 15th National Congress for Defence Studies (NCDS) at Bhonsala Military College (BMC) here.

Stating that fund allocation was less for the defence between 1990-1998, the minister said that since 1999 Kargil war, special attention was being given to provide adequate funds to the armed forces.

He said that the Congress had ""sacrificed"" the chief ministership in the larger interest of the nation.

""The PDP had put the condition that it will join the coalition only if the chief ministership is given to it. We took this decision as without that party the Congress would have run a minority government and appeared to be power hungry,"" Azad said.

""We have arisen above party interest,"" he said.

On the CMP, he said that the views of the two parties were similar on several issues, particularly on Pota and holding of unconditional talks with militants.

16,"Defy Cong directive, farmers tell CM","MYSORE: Farmer leaders on Sunday urged Chief Minister S.M. Krishna to defy the party high command and stick to the stand of not releasing water to Tamil Nadu.

At separate press conferences here, leaders Puttannaiah and Mallesh said it would prove disastrous for Krishna if he followed the party high command reported suggestion to release water.

Puttannaiah said it is the people ""who are the high command"" to Krishna, and not the Congress bosses in Delhi. Both leaders said Krishna will lose his credibility if he releases water to Tamil Nadu.

""We the people of the state will stand by Krishna if he adheres to the statement made at Mandya rally organised to mark the end of his padayatra where he said he was ready to go to jail but will not release water,"" Mallesh said, declaring thousands of farmers from the Cauvery delta will join Krishna in jail.

Both leaders criticised the Supreme Court for not taking into consideration the ground realities and the report submitted by Cauvery River Authority (CRA). ""Remarks of the apex court on water issue are devoid of any logic and appear biased,"" they said.

17,Achilles rules in this Greek tragedy,"BANGALORE: The clock is ticking.

Minutes hurry along, 60 seconds at a time.

Somanahalli Mallaiah Krishna has his fingers crossed.

Maybe, he should clasp his hands and pray.

Crisis after crisis.

The last two decades have been a roller-coaster ride for Bangalore and by extension, the rest of `namma cheluva Kannada nadu''.

Except alas, every high has been followed by a depressing low.

We have not had the luck to be ruled by leaders with visions beyond their narrow political spectrum.

Gundu Rao or Ramakrishna Hegde, Bommai, Deve Gowda or Veerendra Patel, Bangarappa or Moily, J.H. Patel or Krishna, it''s always been one step forward and two steps backward.

The economy boomed every time the mukya mantri kickstarted new developmental projects and went into a tailspin every time the government got trapped in the rhetoric of its political ambitions.

It was obvious from the start that disobeying the Supreme Court order on the release of the Cauvery waters would not be taken lightly by the highest court of the land.

Krishna could have gone down in history as a statesman, had he resigned.

Or better still, obeyed the court.

It was not to be.

Our leaders are men with feet of clay.

Our bureaucrats (a majority of them), have no spines.

Otherwise the chief secretary, the principal secretary and all those advisors to the CM would have made it clear to Krishna avaru that the Supreme Court is one of the pillars of our democracy. In wilfully disobeying its orders, the government has not just been in contempt of the court, but slammed it with a sledge-hammer.

It is said, ""We get the leaders we deserve.''''

Couldn''t be more true.

As the intelligentia steers clear of politics and the riff-raff take over, we get a government where the overwhelming majority of MLAs are nothing but crooks.

The few good men and women who manage to make it to the realm of governance are forced to compromise their principles with the mob.

Krishna avaru has proved time and time again that he means well.

But his Achilles heel stands exposed every time a crisis rears its ugly head.

A leader is one who triumphs over adversity not because of luck or fate, but because of his moral fibre.

We citizens haven''t been blessed with leaders who go beyond `I'' to the gracious and powerful `We''.

Till that day arrives, it will always be fire-fighting time.

No matter how much the water, there will be plenty of burning going on.
