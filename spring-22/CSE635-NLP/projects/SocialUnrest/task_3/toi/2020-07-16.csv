â€˜â€˜The proposed law will not allow those having more than two children to enter government jobs or contest elections,â€™â€™ he said. Advani said â€˜â€˜persuasiveâ€™â€™ methods to check population growth in the country over the past 55 years had had little success.

The government is planning to talk to other political parties to achieve a consensus on introducing a legislation,â€™â€™ Advani told reporters, accompanying him to Gorakhpur.

Later in the day, Advani had a closed-door meeting with Mahant Avaidyanath, member of the Ram Janam Bhoomi Shila Nyas, at the Gorakhnath Temple. Soon after, at a public gathering, Advani said that he was optimistic that a Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya.

1,Cyber cafe blackmailers arrested,"LUCKNOW: In a first of its kind blackmailing racket dealing in pornography being operated allegedly at a cyber cafe in Friend''s Colony of Indiranagar, the police arrested four youths from affluent families and sealed the cyber cafe on Wednesday.

The police raid, which began on a tip-off of a blackmailing racket, brought a shock for the Ghazipur police when they discovered that the cafe was also being used to blackmail many Net users who used cubicles with their partners for some ''intimate browsing''.

What added to the surprise of the police was how a teenaged girl was stripped and photographed at the cafe and then blackmailed by some youths hailing from affluent families.

SP Trans-Gomti Satyendra Veer Singh told TNN that there were reports of some shady activities at Netfun Cyber Cafe in Friend''s Colony area of Indiranagar and hence a raid was conducted. During the raid, police recovered CDs, magazines and other pornographic material from the cafe which led to the arrest of is owner Saleem Siddiqui, son of a property dealer in Bastauli area of Ghazipur.

On being interrogated, Saleem revealed that his associates Saurabh Singh, a BE student of 157 in sector B, Jai Singh of 9/95 in Kurmanchal Nagar and Rishi Srivastava of 941/2 in sector A were also hand in glove in the racket. Circle officer Gomtinagar DySP Rajeshwar Singh, who supervised the raid, said the four accused disclosed how they had stripped a teenaged girl nude in a cubicle at the cafe and photographed her.

The girl was then being blackmailed. One of the accused is the son of a superintending engineer in a government department, while another''s father is a senior officer in the income tax department.

3,"Thanks to rain, farming activity picking up","MYSORE: Following rains in the catchment areas of Krishnarajasagar, Harangi and Kabini dams in the last two days, inflow into these reservoirs has increased much to the relief of the farming community and water resources department authorities.

Also, it has accelerated farming activities in the district in the rain-fed area. Over the last two days, inflow into Krishnarajasagar increased by almost doubled from about 2,000 cusecs to 3,442 cusecs as on Wednesday, while Kabini is receiving 5,981 cusecs and Harangi 1,477 cusecs.

Even though water is being released into canals from the Krishnarajasagar dam, water discharge quantity from the Kabini is 400 cusecs. Elated by the rains and indications that they will get water for their farming activities, farmers in the district have taken up sowing in their fields.

Joint director of Agriculture A.R. Krishnaiah told The Times of India that seeds had been sowed in about 1.71 lakh hectres in the district. â€œIt is about 64 per cent,â€™â€™ he said. Last year in the corresponding period about 1.48 lakh hectres had been sowed, he noted. Initially farmers took up farming activities in March-April due to rainfall. But afterwards the monster drought cast its shadow on the farming activities forcing even Karnataka government to officially throw up its hands in despair. It even sought divine intervention praying for bountiful shower.

About 1.5 lakh hectres in the district depends on canals for irrigation, the joint director noted. But following monsoon rains, things seems to be heading in the right direction since of the 2.7 lakh hectres, seeds have been sowed in 1.7 lakh hectres, he noted adding that the rain will help standing crops as well as help in furthering sowing. While Krishnarajanagar taluk recorded only 24 per cent sowing, which is lowest in the district, Periyapatna recorded 86 per cent, the highest in the district.

Mysore taluk also recorded only 33 per cent sowing while it was 22 percent in Tirumalakudlu Narasipur, 78 per cent in Heggadadevnakote taluk and 68 per cent in Hunsur, Krishnaiah said. However, the cumulative rainfall till July 14 was below average in the district. The district should have received 346.9 mm rainfall. But it has recorded only 239.2 mm till Monday. But when compared to corresponding period last year it is far better as last year the district recorded 191.5 mm rainfall.

But the worrying factor is that the water level in both Kabini and Harangi is low compared to corresponding period last year. While Kabini storage level was 2281 ft last year, this year it is low by about 13 ft. Since water inflow is increasing with inflow crossing 5,000 cusecs mark it is expected that storage level will increase. Also following demand for framers, the Irrigation Consultative Committee (ICC) of Kabini has been convened this Saturday to decide about discharge into canals including Rampura and Hulahalli. Water resources department authorities said rainfall in entire Madikeri district had picked up resulting in increase in inflow to Harangi and Krishnarajasagar.

Harangi recorded inflow of 1,477 cusecs while water storage level was 2828 ft. They also heaved a sigh of relief as water table was gradually increasing in three major reservoirs of Cauvery basin. Cauvery Command Area Development Authority (CADA) chairman H. Srinivas has already clarified that unless water level in Krishnarajasagar - the lifeline of farmers in Cauvery basin reaches 105 ft - water for irrigation purpose will not be made available.

4,Nargund bandh gets total response,"NARAGUND, Gadag: The Nargund bandh call given by the Kalasa Bandur Nala Horata Samiti met with success as all business establishments and educational institutions remained closed on Wednesday.

The samiti, which is fighting for linking Kalasa and Bandur canals to Malaprabha. Hundreds of farmers participated in a procession, which began from Udachamma temple in Dandapur. The protesters submitted a memorandum to the tahasildar later. Addressing a large gathering, convener of the samiti, Vijay Kulkarni alleged that the state government was dilli-dallying to implement the scheme which will benefit thousands of farmers.

The project, when completed, would help the farmers of Malaprabha command area which includes Savadatti, Ramadurg, Badami, Dharwad, Navalgund, Ron and Naragund taluks, besides ensuring adequate water supply to twin cities of Hubli-Dharwad from Malaprabha reservoir.

All India Progressive Janata Dal leader and member of samiti N.H. Konareddy told The Times of India that the state government was not making any efforts to convince the Centre about the importance and urgency of implementing the project. The state has earmarked Rs 15 crore for the project but the Union department of environment has stayed the project. Konareddy alleged that chief minister S.M. Krishna deliberately ignored the project while water resources minister H.K. Patil was keen on its implementation.

7,Evolve political strategy on BPO: Blackwill,"NEW DELHI: India must evolve an effective strategy to deal with the opposition in the US on business process outsourcing, since this could soon become a ""political problem"", outgoing US Ambassador to India Robert D Blackwill said here on Thursday.

""There is a sentiment in the United States about job loss (in case of increased outsourcing to India), but it is not substantial yet. This could well become a political problem and India must put in place a political strategy to deal with this situation,"" he said while speaking at his farewell organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries.

Blackwill''s remarks follow close on the heels of a proposal in four US states to ban outsourcing of processing contracts to developing nations including India.

""For example, if India could say it is importing close to what it is exporting to the United States and convey that it is helping in creating jobs there, the task of people like me, who support the outsourcing activity, to convince people back there will become easier,"" Blackwill said.

""From what I can see right now, imports from the US into India are almost flat"".

The proposed Bill, which seeks to ban outsourcing of government contracts to Asian companies, is being viewed by the Indian IT industry as a latent restriction.

Among those considering the measure to curb flight of jobs in the US are New Jersey, Maryland, Connecticut and Washington.

8,Govt dumps its own policy on forest land,"NEW DELHI: When Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh went into meetings with Prime Minister Vajpayee and Environment Minister Baalu on Thursday, few would have predicted the outcome: A change in government policy which could even open the door to sale of land still legally defined as forest.

By evening, the Union environment ministry said it had agreed to change the legal definition of forest land where encroachment has been regularised. Instead of continuing to be legally defined as forest, this would be converted into revenue land.

This departure from policy, a clear indication of pre-poll posturing between a BJP-led Central government and a Congress-ruled state, could have major implications and see other states lining up with similar demands.

Going by the law, encroachment on forest land before 1980 can be regularised on certain conditions. But even then, the legal status of this land would continue to be defined as forest.

The aim of this clause, says an official, was to retain control, discourage encroachment and ensure land regularised for livelihood use was not exploited for commercial gain. Baalu has agreed to do away with this condition for what has already been regularised. He would presumably have to do the same for cases still pending regularisation.

Officials differ on whether this change needs Supreme Court approval or not. Some say the court, hearing cases on forests, will need to clear this; others say it will not.

The second issue, resolved in most states but lingering in MP for nearly three decades, is the conversion of forest villages into revenue villages, to enable villagers to benefit from development schemes. This is government policy but as far as environment ministry officials are concerned, MP''s backlog is its own fault. ``They had not sent proposals, they have not been following the guidelines.''''

Going by official accounts, MP used this chance to try and dereserve certain areas and get forest land converted into revenue land. In this mess, ``the basic issue remained unattended'''', says an official.

A ministry official said MP came with a list of 316 villages in 11 districts. The Centre has approved over 10,000 hectares in 94 villages over five districts and is ready to clear the case of three more districts by the month-end.

In turn, Singh offered two lollipops: One, assurances on compensatory afforestation; two, assurances on evicting encroachers from 73,000 hectares.

9,Bills to increase allowances and pension of MLAs introduced,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala assembly on Thursday referred to the Subject Committee two bills seeking to increase monthly allowances and pension of MLAs without any amendments.

Introducing the bills, Information and Parliamentary Affairs Minister M M Hassan said increase in allowance was marginal and it should not be construed as a ""huge hike"".

He said the decision to increase the dearness and telephone allowance by Rs 1000 and travelling allowance from Rs 2.50 to Rs 4.50 per kilometres was taken after considering the overall price hike for various items in the last few years. The present hike was after a gap of six years, he added.

Justifying the increase, Hassan said salaries and allowance of MLAs in the state was less compared to what their counterparts were drawing in other states. Additional expenditure per year due to the increase was Rs 43.91 lakh.

Speaker Vakkom Purushothaman said the bills were introduced after a consensus on the issue.

10,Sops for sugarcane farmers,"NEW DELHI: A day after it announced a steep cut in the interest rate on crop loans, the government approved a one-time financial assistance package for sugarcane farmers. This will, in particular, benefit farmers in UP, Uttaranchal and Haryana.

This was announced on Thursday after Prime Minister Vajpayee had a meeting with Finance Minister Jaswant Singh and Agriculture Minister Rajah Singh. Food minister Sharad Yadav was not present but was officially said to have agreed to the decision.

This assistance will be given from the sugarcane development fund controlled by the food ministry. The figure being mentioned is Rs 600 crore but this was not officially confirmed. This could be ``a general, broad figure'''', was one description.

Announcing the decision ``in principle'''' to help states pay the state advisory price to farmers, the government said discussions will now be held with the respective state governments.

Singh has taken up the issue since he became agriculture minister. His home state, UP, has the bulk of sugarcane farming. Arrears to farmers, given the difference between what mill owners are supposed to pay and what they are willing to, have been piling up.

Last month, representatives of 18 cooperative societies of sugarcane growers from UP met Singh, demanding Rs 95-100 a quintal for sugarcane and saying if this price was not given, they would have no incentive to grow it any more.

In an indication of how politically-loaded this issue is, Singh had told them the solution must be viable for sugar mills and its impact on other states would have to be kept in mind as well.

11,US may sell NBC equipment to India: Blackwill,"NEW DELHI: The United States may consider selling ``defensive nuclear, biological and chemical equipment'''' to India under the growing defence cooperation between the two countries, outgoing US ambassador Robert Blackwill said on Thursday.

``In US defence sales to India, we have gone from zero to almost $ 200 million in the past 14 months and are poised for far more ambitious interaction in this field,'''' Blackwill, dwelling at length about the growing Indo-US military cooperation, said in a farewell address to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

He said US defence sales to India would include possible ``defence nuclear, biological and chemical equipment, Special Forces gear and P3 Orion Maritime Patrol aircraft''''.

Indicating the dimension of the military-to-military cooperation between the two countries, he said: ``We now have at least one joint military exercise or engagement each month.''''

These covered a range of fields aimed at improving the skills and capacity for combined military operations across the board -- by Special Forces against terrorist, maritime interdiction, search and rescue, airlift support, logistics transport and airborne assault.

He noted that in June last year, Indian Navy ships `Sukanya'' and `Sharda'' conducted escort patrols for American ships through the Malacca Straits in support of ``Operation Enduring Freedom'''' in Afghanistan.

``Knowing what they would be up against if they had to deal with the Indian Navy, the pirates sensibly stayed away,'''' the US envoy observed.

``With American warships now routinely refueling in Chennai and Mumbai, we saw last September the largest ever US-India naval exercise,'''' Blackwill said, adding that the two were in the ``planning stage for a fighter aircraft exchange''''.

He said more than 180 high ranking officials of the Indian security forces would attend conferences sponsored by the US defence department during the current year. ``To put it directly, US military personnel like interacting with their Indian counterparts because they both come from professional cultures that believe that their central mission is to fight and win wars,'''' he said.

And he asked: ``How many armies can one say that about today? In short, Indian and American soldiers are warriors. That deep commonality is not going to change in either military establishment.''''

12,3 injured in shooting incident near Rander,"SURAT: Three persons were injured in a shooting incident at Amidhara Choksi Wadi near Rander here on Thursday afternoon.

The incident is believed to be the result of a long-pending dispute over some land deal between two groups. According to police, three unidentified persons fired at one Naresh Mafta injuring his hand and shoulder.

Two others, Mustafa and Nimesh, standing nearby also received bullet injuries in the incident. Deputy commissioner of police (west) K L N Rao told TNN that all the three persons were rushed to a nearby hospital.

However, no one had suffered any serious injury. Preliminary investigations revealed that the motive behind the incident could be some old enmity between the two groups over some land deals in Bhestan village.

The assailants, who came on a motorcycle, are absconding. Combing operations have been launched to track them down, Rao said. Interestingly, Nafta was said to be involved in a similar attack on the same group sometime ago. Police are investigating further.

13,One hurt in Baria communal violence,"AHMEDABAD: One person was severely injured on the head in a bout of communal violence which erupted in Devgadh Baria of Dahod district on Wednesday evening.

The victim is Chaturbhai Kasaya who objected to his agricultural land being encroached by some persons from the minority community.

The accused in this case are the alleged encroachers, Yusuf Adam Rasidwala, Yakub Adam Rasidwala, Adam Rasidwala and 29 others who are said to have attacked Kasaya and threatened to kill him if he insisted on getting the land back.

Kasaya told the police in his complaint that the accused had encroached on his land by constructing a house and so he started tilling it when the monsoons set in.

The accused objected to this and a major fight ensued ending up in violence in which Kasaya was hit on the head with an iron pipe and is now in hospital.

The police, however denied that there were any incidents of arson and they said everything had quietened by Wednesday evening.

14,Pandya present in rioting mob: Witness,"AHMEDABAD: A witness deposing before the Nanavati-Shah commission probing the communal riots in Gujarat created a sensation on Thursday by claiming that the slain former home minister Haren Pandya was in the mob which attacked housing societies in the Paldi area of Ahmedabad on February 28 last year.

The witness, Dr Yunus Bhavnagari, alleged that it was due to Pandyaâ€™s presence that the police ignored the Muslim residentsâ€™ call for rescue. The apartment blocks attacked by the mob came under Pandyaâ€™s Ellisbridge constituency.

Pandya, it may be recalled, was gunned down in the Law Garden area on March 26 this year, in what was seen as a reprisal killing by some radical groups.

Bhavnagari, a dentist who used to stay in Delite Flats, had fired at the rioting mob on the day of the VHP bandh on February 28, killing two persons, apparently in self-defence. He told Justice GT Nanavati (retired) and Justice KG Shah (retired) that he saw Pandya in the mob.

â€œThis (Pandyaâ€™s presence) was probably the reason that the police, despite being present at the site, turned a deaf ear to all cries for help,â€� he said.

Bhavnagari said the mobs went on a rampage in the area at around 2 pm, burning shops and houses and indulging in heavy stone-throwing. â€œThe police at the spot gave the mob a helping hand by firing and lobbying tear gas shells on residents,â€� he claimed.

The dentist alleged that his son, Amir, was hit in the chest by a bullet. â€œWe were arrested and locked up in jail as I fired upon the mob in self-defence with my licensed revolver.â€�

Bhavnagari said the residents of the area went through hell for almost four hours and it was only at around 6 pm that they could heave a sigh of relief when the deputy police commissioner VM Pargi arrived with a sizeable force and dispersed the irate crowd.

The police later took the residents to hospital for first-aid and medical assistance. Bhavnagari will be cross-examined on Friday. However, police officials, on being contacted by TNN about the deposition, said that even during the hearing on Bhavnagariâ€™s bail application â€” in the case of the dentist killing two persons â€” it had been clarified that Pandya was present at the site only to save the residents from the mob.

16,Sarpanches skeptical of govt’s development claims,"JALANDHAR: Amidst absence of Akali MLAs of all six districts of the division at the function, the party-backed sarpanches and panches gathered at the oath-taking ceremony, expressed skepticism about the government claims to empower panchayats for development at the grassroots level.

Though the district administration claimed to have invited all the opposition MLAs of six districts of the division through respective deputy commissioners, SAD MLA from Bholath assembly constituency in Kapurthala district Bibi Jagir Kaur denied having received the invite. Amritsar DC Ravinder Singh said he had sent invitations to all the six SAD MLAs in the district.

Attributing political motives, she said that against the normal practice of swearing in sarpanches and panches by block development officers, the ruling Congress collected people to show that all the panhayats have come into their party fold. Moreover, the presence of only Congress MLAs and ministers on the stage was enough proof that the government was politicizing the issue, he said.

Alleging that all development works in the villages had come to standstill, the former SGPC president, however, conceded that giving more powers to panchayats was good move if the government was sincere in doing so.

A first-timer SAD-backed sarpanch of Boparai Baaj Singh village in Amritsar district Kuldip Singh said they would be convinced about the government intentions only after implementation of its claims and assurances. He, however, stressed on the need realize non-political character of panchayats for the sake of overall development.

Daljit Kaur, another SAD-backed woman sarpanch of Raipur Pirbakshwala, Kapurthala district, too, expressed reservations about the government claims but termed the idea of administrative training to them as appreciable.

Besides, Punjab assembly Speaker Dr Kewal Krishhan, social welfare minister Joginder Singh Maan, Balbir Singh MP, technical education minister Mohinder Singh Kaypee, health and family welfare minister Ramesh Dogra and Congress MLAs were present.
