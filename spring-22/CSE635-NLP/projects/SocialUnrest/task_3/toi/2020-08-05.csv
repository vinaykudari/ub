2,BJP MPs in election mode,"NEW DELHI: The BJP was clearly in election mode on Tuesday. First, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, presiding over a meeting of the party's parliamentary wing, accused the Congress and Opposition parties of raking up Ayodhya since it appeared to have no other issue to raise. Then, several MPs, led by Uttar Pradesh's Sis Ram Ravi asked the government to act swiftly on three items on the BJP's agenda -- Ram temple, uniform civil code and population control -- but he received no response. Later, responding to a query, Advani said a final decision on synchronising Lok Sabha and Assembly elections would be taken only after the matter was discussed within the BJP and Union Cabinet, as well as with Opposition parties. Law Minister Arun Jaitley came in for praise in Advani's speech for ""exposing"" the Opposition's baseless allegations against the government. In his address, the Deputy PM listed the achievements of the NDA government, providing MPs with talking points. The government had already passed the ""historic"" electoral reforms legislation intended to check misuse of money power in elections and enable military and paramilitary personnel to exercise their franchise through proxy voting.

3,Para Road incident turns into political potboiler,"LUCKNOW: Developments in Para Road incident have turned the issue of pathetic civic conditions there into a political potboiler. And the controversy continues to thicken rather than to subside, with every single passing day. On Tuesday morning, housing and urban development minister Lalji Tandon visited Para Road and, while addressing local residents allegedly called for taking to task all those involved in the last week's protest, and promised to get civic conditions attended to. The flutter thus created was yet to subside when the state minorities Commission (SMC) issued a press release virtually in tune with the response of Tandon, adding fuel to fire as it quoted SMC chairman Ashish Massey as rejecting the act of Renuka Deen addressing mediapersons on her findings into the inquiry on Monday. What landed as the proverbial last straw was the chairman feigning ignorance of the text of the press note stating that he was in Almora on Tuesday. Talking to Times News Network on phone, Renuka Deen said that she had been under tremendous pressure from Tandon to keep off the issue. She claimed that Tandon had been approaching her on telephone using all his efforts to make her stay mum on the issue. I have been first coaxed and then threatened but I have taken up the cause of the masses and not for vested interests, she told TNN on Tuesday evening. Regarding the SMC press note, Renuka Deen said that she had spoken to Ashish Massey on phone and he had denied having issued any statement. He said he was in Almora so how could he issue a statement without even going through the report, Renuka added. Massey was too particular about what he said on the issue when contacted on phone by this journalist. I am on way to Lucknow and will go through the report once I reach there, Massey said adding that he had earlier received complaints of John Augustine that he was involved in incidents of land grabbing. I have received reports and complaints about him and he is not a real priest and has a fake priesthood obtained from Australia which has not legal or religious sanctity here, Massey added. Commenting on his statement about Renuka Deen as mentioned in the press note, Massey said that he was not aware of the exact contents of the press release and would be able to react to it once he reached the state capital. A member of the SMC, speaking on condition of anonymity, when contacted for comments on the mix-up at the commission, revealed that SMC PRO Qamar Ali who had released the press statement was a member of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Working Committee. Tandon criticising SMC member Renuka in public and Qamar Ali issuing a statement on behalf of the chairman with similar connotations in itself explains what's happening behind the scene, the member said.

4,Residents protest sale of garba ground,"VADODARA: As the chief minister gets ready to go to London and Geneva to sell Navratra to global investors on August 17, he should not be surprised if garba organisers in Vadodara complain of inadequate space for holding such grand festivals. The famous Ambalal cross roads ground, which is considered amongst the favourite spots for Navratri buffs after Archi and United Way, is now under the hammer. The Ambalal ground, which measures 16,000 square metres, was once a favourite spot for Navratri revellers. Out of this, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has decided to set aside 8,000 square metres for commercial purposes and leasing while nearly 1,000 square metres has already been sold to one Gujarat Gram Haat for setting up their premises. The ground used to serve as a playing ground for children of a school adjoining the ground and was christened 'morning joggers' paradise' by local residents. The ground was also used by cricketers to hold under-19 cricket tournaments for the last 15 years. The standing committee of the VMC argues that 5,000 square metres which is set aside by the corporation is adequate for organisers to hold cultural events and that the decision was taken in the interest of the civic body which is already reeling under severe financial strains. The decision of the VMC, however, has drawn serious objections from Karelibaug residents as some of the much talked about garba grounds like Amrapali and Jyotipark which were private properties have been reserved for commercial complexes. This would be the last time we would have a garba on this ground. After Amrapali and Jyotipark met similar fate, this was the last chunk of land left for residents here, says a resident of Ambalal Park Yogesh Patel. I have been living here for the past 32 years and for nearly 13 years the ground has been used as a garba ground. By selling almost half of this land, the place will loose its charm. The ground could accommodate around five or six thousand people. It was also used to hold under-19 cricket tournaments for the last 15 years. By selling this land, the civic authorities have hurt our sentiments, adds Patel. Insiders in the VMC say that Ambalal ground figures in TP scheme 9 which is reserved for setting up a central market in the area. Also, a plot (no 88) along the 30 metre main road in the same area which was reserved for building a community centre was sold off to two different temple trusts in the area. Another oddly-shaped plot (Nos. 153,111, 33) which is being declared by the civic body as 'green belt area' is now being encroached by squatters and street vendors. ""The said allotment which has brought variations in the TP scheme 9 prepared in 1978 for the area can be challenged under the provisions of sections 70A and 72 of the Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976,"" says city-based advocate Sapan Teredesai. ""The VMC is being issued statutory notices in this case to stall further sale of plots in the area that do not agree with the TP scheme,"" adds Teredesai. ""The VMC is reeling under tremendous financial crisis and the sale of plots is necessary. These are prime plots in the area which will bring revenue to the corporation,"" says standing committee chairman Bharat Shah.

5,Miryalaguda legislator protest half-naked,"NALGONDA: Repala Srinivas, congress legislator from Miryalaguda, who is known for novel protests, became talk of the state again on Tuesday with another protest. Srinivas began 9-hour sit-in strike without shirt and trouser in protest against the attitude of the AP Transco towards farmers of Nalgonda. He began his protest around 10 a.m. in front of office of the additional divisional engineer, Miryalaguda along with his hundreds of followers. With only one short on his body and a garland around his neck, MLA Srinivas addressed huge gathering. He alleged that the state government has failed to keep its promise to supply power un-interruptedly for 9 hours and the farmers of the state were cheated by this act. According to him Nalgonda farmers are hardly getting four to five hours of supply in a day and thousands of acres under the non-command area becoming dry. The Congress MLA, while justifying his protest told that the amount for Tatkal scheme to get new agriculture connection or regularization has been increased from Rs.1000 to Rs.2000, which is a shock to the small farmers. He demanded the state government to withdraw the hike and also asked to keep the promise of 9 hours un-interruptedly.

7,Keepers of the law complain of neglect,"PUNE: The alleged suicide by a 43-year-old police constable last Friday, apparently on account of mental strain, has once again brought into focus the need for implementation of police reforms for the constabulary. Although a high power committee in 1987 recommended a series of reforms for the police force in Maharashtra, these have not been implemented, much to the disappointment of keepers of the law. Yadav Maruti Gaikwad (43) of Bibvewadi, attached to the Sahakarnagar police station, died on Friday evening after he fell from the second floor of the building he was residing in. Survived by his wife, daughter and son, Yadav left behind a suicide note in which he said that no one was to be blamed. Sources, however, said that Yadav was under mental strain and had differences with his seniors over grant of leave. Senior police officials have rejected these reasons, stating that Yadav's death was a case of suicide unrelated to his duty. Even city police commissioner A.N. Roy told TNN that the city constabulary is not overworked. The death of the constable and police reforms are not linked. It is a personal issue, he said. Former police officials, however, say that the service conditions of the constabulary are going from that they are helpless as they do not have other means of employment and are forced to work under extreme conditions. Long hours of service, poor payment, unsatisfactory family life, absence of leave, poor housing facilities and general apathy from seniors and the society are the woes of the constabulary. Former Pune police commissioner and a vocal supporter of reforms, Bhaskarrao Misar, told TNN on Sunday, The constables have no job satisfaction. They are under strain with the amount of work load. On the police high power committee of 1987, Misar said it consisted of civilians and police officials, who had made some easy recommendations not requiring any additional expenditure. In 1992, when the question of what happened to the recommendations assembly, the government had answered that it had accepted the reforms and that they were being implemented, Misar said. Today, the police force has lost the energy to implement the reforms because of political interference, he said. There is also a fear among officers, that if the constabulary is made strong, then they would stand to lose their powers. Most constables who spoke to TNN â€” on condition of anonymity The way in which we work daily drives us to the edge, said a constable attached to the Pune police commissionerate. A senior constable added, We work nearly 18 hours a day without a weekly off. Isn't that asking too much of a person? Most constables spend a majority of their waking (even sleeping) hours away from home, making their married lives a mess. Add to this the constant pressure from seniors as well as the society and you The basic educational qualification for a constable is a higher secondary school certificate. He earns up to Rs 7,000 per month, but housing, if provided, is inadequate. An added burden the policemen have to face is the frequent, but haphazard security duty to protect movements of VIPs visiting the city.

8,PMC engineers arrested for boy's death,"PUNE: High drama prevailed in the Bund Garden area on Monday night after top officials from the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) and politicians stormed the police station to plead for the release of civic engineers, who had been arrested earlier in the day for negligence that allegedly lead to the death of a 9-year-old boy. Ashutosh Waghmare died on July 11 when a stone wall of the Railway quarters compound along the Private road area had caved in. On Monday local residents took out a morcha to the police station, pressing for immediate action in the case.The police then arrested six people, including two PMC engineers, on charges of negligence leading to culpable homicide. As the news of the arrest spread, PMC additional commissioner D.S. Zagade, engineer Prashant Waghmare, PMC engineers' association leader Dnyaneshwar Molak and several ward officers rushed to the police station around midnight. Soon, minister of state for tourism Chandrakant Chhajed, mayor Dipti Chaudhari and corporator Abhay Chhajed also reached the police station. Sources told TNN that Chhajed and Zagade phoned police commissioner A.N. Roy, demanding the release of the PMC engineers. However, Roy refused to budge. Chhajed then phoned home minister Chhagan Bhujbal around 1.30 am and requested him to intervene. Molak threatened a flash strike and warned that PMC staff on emergency duty will join it. The drama ended around 2 am, when the police finally released the accused on bail.

9,Polytechnic students seek waiver of development fee,"HYDERABAD: City polytechnic students led by the Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) have demanded cancellation of development fee in polytechnic colleges.

ABVP city secretary R Sashidhar, who led a student delegation which staged a demonstration at the technical education commissioner''s office near Tank Bund, said government was collecting an additional Rs 3,000 as development fee from second-year students in polytechnic colleges across the state. He said the fee, which had been introduced last year, was cancelled earlier this year due to drought conditions.

On July 22, however, the second-year students received a circular saying they were expected to pay the fee this year as they had already committed to pay it in their first year, Sashidhar said.

He said technical colleges were funded by the World Bank and there was no necessity for any additional fee for their maintenance or development. He demanded the immediate cancellation of the fee.

Technical education joint Director P T Prabhakar, who received the representation, said the technical education department was only abiding by the All India Council for Technical Education''s recommendations on imposing a development fee in technical colleges.

However, he assured the agitating students that their representation would be presented before the government.

10,Citu seeks minister's intervention in dispute,"HYDERABAD: The Centre for Indian Trade Unions (Citu) has appealed to the labour minister, P Babu Mohan, to immediately declare GO MS No. 9(a) of Industrial Disputes (ID) Act, 1947, as illegal and arbitrary regarding the jute mill dispute in Visakhapatnam.

The management of Chittivalasa Jute Mill, Visakhapatnam, following the issue of the ID Act, 1947, wanted to reduce the present wages, freeze the dearness allowance, introduce double wages and contract labour system, claimed Citu general secretary S Veeraiah in a statement.

All the proposed changes by the management were against the interest of the workers, he said in his statement.

In 2001, the management and workers had arrived at a wage settlement and presented it before the deputy labour commissioner, Visakhapatnam, Veeraiah said in the statement.

The mill has been locked since then, and after all trade unions in the mill had raised a dispute before the commissioner of labour, a conciliation was reached on August 2, 2003.

The commissioner had promised to issue an order negating the notice by the 9(a) and declaring it illegal.

11,BJP stages dharnas for Siwan MP's arrest,"PATNA: The BJP held statewide dharnas on Tuesday demanding immediate arrest of the controversial RJD MP from Siwan, Mohammad Shahabuddin, and CBI probe into the Gopalganj bank dacoity case as well as his alleged links with inter-state and international gangs.

Several prominent leaders of the party participated in the day-long dharnas and addressed meetings. ""We demand immediate arrest of Shahabuddin in connection with the kidnapping and suspected murder of CPI-ML worker Munna Chaudhary and CBI probe into the bank dacoity committed at Gopalganj by criminals allegedly patronised by the MP, his links with inter-state and international gangs and the source of his huge wealth,"" said state BJP president Nand Kishore Yadav.

He accused RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav of patronising ""elements such as Shahabuddin"" for serving his own political interest. He said the BJP would intensify the agitation if the RJD MP is not arrested immediately. BJP workers held demonstrations and dharnas at all district headquarters in the state and submitted memoranda to the district magistrates to press their demands, Nand Kishore said.

""The criminals are so desperate that the day is not far off when they will train their guns on the RJD president himself,"" the BJP leader warned. Assailing RJD ministers and legislators for coming out in support of Shahabuddin and demanding removal of the DGP, Nand Kishore said, ""Let there be a separate probe into these leaders'' role in the criminal acts committed by the fugitive Lok Sabha member from Siwan and his henchmen."" State Lok Janshakti Party chief Narendra Singh also demanded immediate arrest of the Siwan MP.

""It''s the time when everyone should get serious about control on crime,"" he stated, adding that both the state government and the DGP deserve to be thanked for the drive against Shahabuddin. He, however, expressed his surprise over the role of some RJD leaders demanding action against DGP D P Ojha, saying that they are demeaning the judiciary and trying to break the morale of the police force.

14,"Shilpi, Gautam committed suicide: CBI","PATNA: The CBI on its part has closed the infamous Shilpi-Gautam death case, saying the two had committed suicide.

In its final investigation report submitted to the court of special CBI judge S K Pandey, the premier investigating agency has said that there existed no evidence to suggest that Gautam Singh and Shilpi Jain, whose semi-nude bodies were found in a Maruti Zen car parked in a garage in Patna on July 3, 1999, were murdered.

The death of the two youths, said to be lovebirds, had rocked the state and the case was handed over to the CBI for probe amid allegations that the local police were out to hush up the matter to save the skin of some politicians. The CBI said experts of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Patna, had found that Aluminium Phosphide was the cause of the two deaths.

Aluminium Phosphide is commonly known as Celphos. It is used for grain preservation and is highly poisonous. The CBI report further said that the sequence of events clearly indicated that it was a case of suicide. The charges of sexual assault and gangrape of Shilpi were also not found correct as the semen found on the clothes of Shilpi was that of Gautam, the CBI said.

15,Pak man with suspected al-Qaeda links arrested,"NEW YORK: The FBI has arrested a Pakistani man suspected of having links with the mastermind of September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States, NBC television network reported on Tuesday. Uzair Paracha, who was arrested by the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force four months ago, is being held here as a material witness and is likely to be charged this week for providing material support to al-Qaeda, NBC reported quoting FBI officials. According to senior US law enforcement officials Paracha, is closely connected to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the alleged al-Qaeda mastermind arrested in Pakistan in March. Officials, however, do not know if Paracha is actually a member of al-Qaeda and hasve no information that he was planning any specific terror attacks. Officials also do not believe the company from where Paracha was arrested is connected to terrorism. His father, the report says, runs a clothing export firm in Karachi that regularly ships large containers full of clothing to Newark, New Jersey and that is the cause of concern. Paracha's father, Saifullah, was about to board a plane in Karachi last month when he was allegedly arrested by Pakistani police. US sources say the father is in custody.

17,US defence shield flawed,"NEW DELHI: India''s hopes of an acquiring an effective defensive umbrella from the United States could be folded as experts feel there is ""fatal flaw"" in the long range missile defence system.

For India, which is under potential missile threats from ""nuclear power"" neighbours and civilisationally hostile forces, a defensive umbrella in which a tracking satellite can seek and neutralise enemy missiles in mid-air is no small protection.

Defence officials here hinted that during the India-US Defence Policy Group (DPG) meet, scheduled to begin on Wednesday in Washington, the two sides are expected to decide the future course of their growing defence cooperation. Joint exercises and the sale of hi-tech military hardware are to be discussed in the meet.

Founder of India Caucus, Congressman Frank Pallone, had said he would urge the Bush administration to expedite the approval of the sale of a missile defence shield to India. He said New Delhi has been keen on a partnership with Washington on strategic defence against theater and long-range missiles and also against international terrorism and to safeguard borders and share intelligence.

But scientists at the American Physical Society say intercepting missiles while their rockets are still burning would not be an effective approach for defending against attacks by an important type of enemy missile.

Missile experts in the US have come to the conclusion after a study into the scientific and technical feasibility of boost-phase (disabling ballistic missiles while they are still under power) defence, focusing on potential missile threats from North Korea and Iran. Boost-phase defence recently received much attention as one possible element of a National Missile Defense system.

Scientists reveal that issues of timing severely limit the feasibility of this approach. The short time window available for disabling an enemy missile means the interceptor rockets would have to be based close to enemy territory to have a chance of intercepting the missile in time, if it is possible at all.

The experts found that defending the United States or for that matter any country against solid-propellant ICBMs would be impractical in many cases, because of their short burn times. According to the US intelligence community, countries of concern could deploy such ICBMs within 10 to 15 years.

Even against the longer burning liquid-propellant ICBMs that North Korea or Iran might initially deploy, a boost-phase defence would have limited use due to the requirement that interceptors be based close to potential missile flight paths.

""Only two to three minutes would be available to achieve a boost-phase intercept, even assuming substantial improvements in systems for detecting and tracking missiles,"" says Frederick Lamb, who led the study group.

""Consequently, even fast interceptors could have difficulty catching liquid-propellant ICBMs and would be unable to catch solid-propellant ICBMs in time. In the most optimistic scenarios, the defence would have only seconds to decide whether to fire interceptors and could be required to make this decision before knowing whether a rocket launch were a space mission or a missile attack,"" he observes.

However, boost-phase defence against short- or medium-range missiles launched from ships off US coasts appears technically possible, provided ships carrying interceptors could stay within about 40 kilometres of the threatening ships.

The experts looked at boost-phase defense systems utilising land-, sea-, or air-based interceptors, space-based interceptors, or the airborne laser.

The effectiveness of interceptor rockets would be limited by the short time window for intercept, which requires interceptors to be based within 400 to 1,000 kilometers of the possible boost-phase flight paths of attacking missiles. In some cases this is closer than political geography allows.

Even interceptors that were very large and fast and that pushed the state of the art would in most cases be unable to intercept solid-propellant ICBMs before they released their warheads.

According to experts a system of space-based interceptors, also constrained by the short time window for intercept, would require a fleet of a thousand or more orbiting satellites just to intercept a single missile.

Deploying such a fleet would require a five- to tenfold increase in the United States'' annual space-launch capabilities. Then as far as India is concerned, this would go up multifold.

The airborne laser, currently in development, has the potential to intercept liquid-propellant ICBMs, but its range would be limited and it would therefore be vulnerable to counterattack.

""Few of the components exist for deploying an effective boost-phase defence against liquid-propellant ICBMs and some essential components would take at least 10 years to develop,"" says another missile defence expert Daniel Kleppner.

""According to US intelligence estimates, North Korea and Iran could develop or acquire solid-propellant ICBMs within the next 10 to 15 years. Consequently, a boost-phase defense effective only against liquid-propellant ICBMs would risk being obsolete when deployed,"" Kleppner, who co-chaired the study points out.

Although a successful intercept would prevent munitions from reaching their target, live nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads could strike populated areas short of the target in the United States or in other countries. This ""shortfall problem"" is inherent in any boost-phase defense and difficult to avoid.

19,BJP denies hand in toppling Mithi govt,"SHILLONG: BJP has strongly denied allegations that it was instrumental in toppling the Mukut Mithi-led Congress Government in Arunachal Pradesh and said the state government''s all round ""failure"" and infighting among party leaders had led to its fall.

""The party strongly refutes the malicious and baseless allegation levelled by the Congress that it was instrumental in toppling the Mithi government"", reads a resolution adopted by BJP''s north-eastern zonal meet that ended on Tuesday.

The all round ""failure"" of the Mithi government and infighting among state Congress leaders were the reasons for its collapse, the party said.

The Mithi government was reduced to a minority on July 27 when a large number of Congress legislators defected from the party and joined the United Democratic Front led by Arunachal Congress leader Gegong Apang who assumed office of the Chief Minister on Sunday last.

20,Chohan serves notice to Centre for SGPC elections,"CHANDIGARH: Former Khalistan ideologue Jagjit Singh Chohan has served a legal notice to the Union Home ministry for conducting elections to the general house of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandak Committee, which have been due since 2001.

The notice says that if the Centre and the State government did not initiate process for holding the elections within one month, he would move the Punjab and Haryana High Court to seek the redressal.

Under the All-India Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925, the Union Home ministry is to get the election conducted every five years by the Gurdwara Election Commission. Incidently the Commission has already initiated the election process by preparing fresh electoral rolls.

Chohan, who still claims to be a votary of Khalistan, said the present house of the SGPC which is headed by Gurcharan Singh Tohra ,had no legal right to continue in office.

He demanded that an administrator be appointed to run the SGPC till the elections were completed.

Chohan had returned to India after remaining in the UK for more than 18 years from where he allegedly motivated the Sikh youth to participate in the Khalistan movement.

Chohan, who heads the Khalsa Raj party, said he still favoured formation of Khalistan, but was against adopting violent means for the cause.

21,Shiv Sena raps govt over CAS,"NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday came under severe attack from its ally Shiv Sena and main Opposition Congress for its uplinking policy, which demanded that any foreign channel violating norms should not be given uplinking facility.

Congress member Kapil Sibal told the Rajya Sabha that ""uplinking policy should be non-discriminatory and any party, which violates norms, should not be given uplinking facility"".

Earlier, initiating a calling attention on implementation of Conditional Access System (CAS) and criteria for uplinking for foreign channels, Shiv Sena member Sanjay Nirupam said that the FDI policy for foreign channels should be on the lines of one pursued for print media which made it mandatory for 51 per cent equity for Indian partners besides the editorial control.

Both Sibal and Nirupam criticised the CAS policy saying it had only created ""confusion and anarchy"" and sought to know how the government was going to ensure that the consumers would not have to shell out more than what they were paying to cable operators now.

Nirupam wondered what was the need for introduction of CAS when the government had already decided to move on to DTH system.

He feared that 15 lakh people employed in the cable TV industry would become jobless resulting in social unrest.

Singh said that the results of sectoral reforms introduced in the aviation sector showed a mixed trend. In telecom sector, substantial reforms were more or less over and benefits had started trickling down to masses in the form of lower tariffs.

He observed that low turnaround time at domestic ports was no longer a handicap and government had initiated steps to throw open the sector with legislation pending before Parliament, which would pave the way for conversion of port trusts into corporate entities.

On power sector reforms, he said that the last few years had witnessed major changes with the passing of new electricity legislation recently and launch of Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (APDRP).

Charge d''Affairs at US Embassy Robert Blake said that merchandise exports had topped $50 billion last year and future growth was expected.

Blake further said that India must develop its ports, roads and power sector otherwise inadequate infrastructure would hamper growth through creation of bottlenecks.

24,WB govt to restructure 16 state undertakings,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government is in the process of restructuring 16 of its undertakings. Two will be shut down, while 10 others will be converted into joint venture firms with private sector undertakings.

The remaining four will be run completely as state government undertakings.

""Most government undertakings have shown significant growth in recent years. The four firms are cases in point. The government is also showing its intentions clearly by attempting to restructure 16 other state undertakings,"" Sen said.

Among the firms which will be restructured as joint ventures, is the city based Krishna Glass and Silicate Corporation, once a leading glass manufacturer.

26,Simultaneous polls will lead to cheating: EC,"NEW DELHI: As a controversy rages over the suggestion for synchronisation of Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh on Wednesday said simultaneous polls will lead to ""cheating like hell"" which cannot be tackled and the idea is of anti-democratic character.

However, the Commission is prepared to hold Lok Sabha polls anytime if the situation demanded.

Lyngdoh also dismissed Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s idea on synchronisation of polls as ""not a happy proposal.""

""There are certain states which need special attention. In terms of electoral records it is very bad. Obviously we cannot allow everybody to go to polls at the same time. It is not a good situation to have everybody going to polls at the same time.

""We won''t be able to pay attention. They will cheat like hell and we won''t know what to do with that,"" he said in an interview.

In any case, he said, why should any state be oriented towards Parliamentary elections. ""There is nothing in democracy which says Parliament is more important than Assembly. They all have same weightage. Why should not Parliament be oriented towards Assembly elections. So it is not democracy. That is it.""

29,Telgi's lawyer remanded to police custody,"PUNE: Judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) M.N Bondre on Wednesday remanded Abdul Rashid Sikandar Saheb Kulkarni alias Rafique Kulkarni, lawyer of Abdul Karim Telgi â€” alleged kingpin in the fake stamp paper racket â€” to police custody till August 16.

The 49th accused to be booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in the Rs 3,000-crore scam was produced before the court by the Pune policeâ€™s special investigation team (SIT).

Demanding 30 daysâ€™ police custody for Kulkarni, special public prosecutor Raja Thakare said the SIT had arrested Kulkarni only after gathering sufficient evidence of his involvement in the racket. It had come to a point when, without custodial interrogation, further investigation could not proceed.

Thakare revealed that on January 10, 2003, when the police raided the kingpinâ€™s flat at Colaba, Mumbai, they recovered Kulkarniâ€™s suitcase, bearing Rs 4.99 lakh in cash. Thakare said the SIT summoned Kulkarni in January 2003, but he did not respond. â€œThe SIT could have arrested him then but did not,â€� he said.

Thakare, however, admitted Kulkarni had appeared before the SIT on May 25, 2003. Thakare further revealed that Kulkarniâ€™s explicit role in the scam came to light only after the arrest of suspended assistant police inspector Dilip Kamat. Thereafter, Kulkarniâ€™s residence was searched and a cassette tape recorder.

The recorder had been fitted in a car which had earlier been used in the murder of a Telgi associate. Kulkarniâ€™s role in that murder needs further investigation, he submitted. Further augmenting his case, Thakare claimed two witnesses had told the SIT that Kulkarni had earned lakhs of rupees by transgressing all (professional) norms and assisting the crime syndicate.

â€œHe received Rs 35 lakh on two different occasions when Telgi was in the custody of the Pune police,â€� Thakare alleged. The SIT is yet to recover the amount from Kulkarni. Mounting a strong counter-attack, defence counsel Shrikant Shivde alleged that Kulkarni had been arrested without proper understanding of the law.

The SIT holds a grudge against Kulkarni, Shivde said, for he has proved an obstacle in their path since the beginning. â€œI agree, he had filed the vakalatnama on behalf of Telgi and other accused. This is what is held by the police against him.â€� Shivde pointed out that Kulkarni has never been named a suspect.

â€œA lawyer going to his clientâ€™s flat is not an offence,â€� he argued. The defence counsel refuted reports that Kulkarni had acted as an agent for the police and the scam accused. He reiterated the allegation that the SIT had threatened Kulkarni when he refused to reveal any police officers involved in the scam.

â€œKulkarni is merely a scapegoat in the fight between two lobbies of police officers,â€� Shivde said. He said the murder charges (related to the car tape recorder mentioned above) were beyond the scope of the SIT,which is in charge of the fiscal scam.

Shivde claimed Kulkarni was burdened by heavy loans and did not have lakhs of rupees as alleged by the prosecution. He, therefore, requested the court to grant magisterial custody and insisted the SIT may interrogate Kulkarni only from 10 am to 5 pm. He expressed the fear that Kulkarni may be tortured during nightly interrogations.

32,Face of riots turns his back on Ahmedabad,"AHMEDABAD: He was the face of the Gujarat riots. And thatâ€™s perhaps what will haunt him for the rest of his lives.

But for the time being, Naseeruddin Qutubuddin Ansari, 30, whose tear-stained face, blood-soaked clothes and folded hands pleading to the police to rescue him from a mob in Naroda was splashed in newspapers and magazines all over the world, has decided to leave Gujarat for good.

Ansari, a tailor by profession, has decided to take up the offer of West Bengalâ€™s Higher Education Minister Mohammed Haleem, and shift to Kolkata where the Left Front government will provide him with rented accommodation and a shop.

Ansari, who is presently in Mumbai, said over phone that he will be shifting his family, comprising his mother, wife and two children, to Kolkata shortly.

The offer was made by the West Bengal minister after a report appeared in Communalism Combat edited by Teesta Setalvad in the April issue that Ansari was finding it difficult to stay in Ahmedabad because everyone identified him with the photograph. The article said that he even tried to move to Malegaon in Maharashtra and Mumbai but again got identified as the man who became the face of the Gujarat riots.

Ansari said he had finally decided to shift to West Bengal after giving the issue ""a lot of thought"". He said he was too scared to move around on the streets in Ahmedabad or go out to work because people recognised him everywhere.

33,BJP objects to CEC's remarks on simultaneous polls,"HYDERABAD: The state unit of the BJP has taken strong exception to the objection raised by chief election commissioner J M Lyngdoh on the concept of simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.

Talking to reporters on Wednesday, BJP state vice president S V Seshagiri Rao wanted to know as to why it would not be feasible to conduct simultaneous elections. He said even the Congress had indicated that it was not opposed to the suggestion, but only maintained that a formal view would be taken after the government drew up a concrete plan.

The BJP leader wondered as to how Lyngdoh could say that the synchronisation of elections would not cut down on expenditure. Rao observed that the proposal of conducting simultaneous elections articulated by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, would facilitate good governance besides levying less burden on the national exchequer.

Asked whether the party would set a precedent by dissolving the Lok Sabha and then ask for the synchronisation of polls, Rao said that the Centre had been holding deliberations with different parties on the pros and cons of the concept.

35,Strike threatened to protest engineers arrest,"PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation Engineers Association has threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the police action against the two civic engineers and others who have been booked under the charge of gross negligence which allegedly lead to the death of a nine-year-old boy, is not withdrawn forthwith.

""Even the essential services will not be spared from the strike. The municipal commissioner should issue a letter to police commissioner asking him to withdraw the action immediately,"" Sunil Kadam, secretary of the Association has stated in an official communiquÃ© issued on Wednesday.

The civic engineers held demonstrations in the PMC premises on Wednesday afternoon and wore black badges to express their protest against the Pune police.

They have threatened to continue holding such demonstrations for next couple of days after which an official notice of the indefinite strike will be served to the commissioner. Municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar called on the agitating engineers and assured the engineers to take up the issue with the police commissioner.

Ashutosh Waghmare, the boy, had died on July 11 when a stone wall of the Railway quarters compound along the Private road area had caved in.

The Bund Garden police had on Monday night arrested two PMC engineers-- Shirish Bhangare and Pradeep Rangdale, PMC mason Dattatray Dhube and civic contractors, Dilip Hanamdar, Sandeep Hanamdar and Dheeraj Anchalkar. The six accused had carried out the work of laying a sewage pipeline near the Railway quarters in July.

The police had justified the arrests arguing that though the stone wall belonged to the Central Railway it collapsed on account of the PMC laying a sewage pipeline near the wall.

MUST

The Association has strongly challenged this argument of police. They have claimed that the work of laying the sewage pipeline near the wall had been completed a month before the mishap happened.

Also, the subsequent work carried out by the department was no were near the wall. hence, the claim of the police that the wall had collapsed owing to the sewage line work is baseless, the association has argued.

""After the PMCâ€™s sewage line work the Railway authorities had increased the height of the wall by five foot. They had also dumped rubble along the wall and this led to the collapse of the wall. The railwayâ€™s had not sought any permission from the PMC for constructing the wall,"" the PMC engineers association has charged.

39,Local industry immune to city port labour unrest,"KOLKATA: ""It was only expected,"" was the instant reaction of M L Lohia, president of Kolkata based manufacturing giant HDC Ltd when asked to comment on the recent spate of labour unrest at the Kolkata dock complex.

The quip from Lohia is not only a pointer to the immunity developed by the local industry over the years towards such incidents at the port but also the sheer disgust that such fiascos evoke at present.

Mincing no words, the chairman of the Indian Jute Mills'' Association (IJMA), G M Singhvi, said, ""the jute industry suffered a lot at the hands of Kolkata port. From bargemen'' strike to stoppage of loading and unloading job - the industry had seen it all. The jute mills had missed the delivery schedule so many times that it lost several foreign export orders.""

Singhvi informed that things did improve a couple of years back but now it seems to be back to square one.

According to Lohia, HDC ships its export cargo from Haldia instead of Kolkata. ""The American President Line (APL) - one of the biggest shipping liners in the world unload the cargo at Kolkata port but never takes any export cargo from here. It loads the stuff from Haldia. We have to carry the consignment from our factory to Haldia incurring extra cost.""

In a candid confession Lohia said, ""you would not be able to do anything at Kolkata port without paying the mastani or rangdari charges. We try to import as less as possible through the Kolkata port due to these reasons. The Haldia dock is much better compared to Kolkata.""

Industrialist C P Mehra who runs Pacific Cotspin Ltd (a 100 per cent export oriented unit) has also switched over from Kolkata port to Haldia. An exporter of cotton yarns, Mehra pointed out that ""we had opted for Haldia due to faster service, lower cost and minimal labour problem. Compared to Kolkata port the various charges at Haldia port are also lower,"" said Mehra.

The secretary general of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, Nazeeb Arif, observed that due to draft problem the modern liners shun Kolkata port.

""The port is already handicapped. Over and above this if labour unrest, instigated by outside elements continues, then it would kill the Kolkata port,"" said Arif.

40,RPF personnel arrested in Howrah,"KOLKATA: A Railway Protection Force personnel was arrested along with two of his associates for robbing a couple of businessmen of Rs 330,000 and two mobile phones near Howrah station.

After the Government Railway Police officials received a complaint, three simultaneous raids were conducted and the trio were arrested on Wednesday afternoon.

Tapas Kumar Bairagi and Shariff Rezeuil Mondal, the businessmen, were on their way back home from a business trip to Kolkata, when they were intercepted by Tewari at the ferry ghat on the banks of Hooghly on Tuesday evening.

""Tewari first held the two and threatened to book them as smugglers if they did not pay up hush money. Soon he was joined by two associates Susaj Lashkar and Somu Mullick. All of them then boarded a Midnapore bound local train from Howrah station new complex. The businessmen were forced to get down at Tikiapara station. When they found that the two were not giving up easily, they literally robbed the businessmen of their money and the mobile phones,"" said GRP officer Ashok Hazari.

41,State passes law to compensate for VAT,"BANGALORE: The Legislative Assembly on Wednesday passed the Karnataka Sales Tax (amendment) Bill, amidst a walkout by BJP members.

The Bill replaces an ordinance promulgated to levy an additional one per cent sales tax on 237 commodities, to compensate for the non-introduction of value-added tax by the Centre.

Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister D B Chandre Gowda, who piloted the Bill, said: ""The additional revenue from hiking the tax is Rs 250 crore as against the total sales tax projection of Rs 8,000 crore this year. The hike will hardly make any difference.""

Since the Centre ""abruptly"" decided against imposing the VAT, Karnataka had to resort to this ""contingency plan"" to mop up revenue. ""They had promised us Rs 750 crore as compensation for VAT. But, with this hike that we have proposed, we will only be able to reach the revenue level of March 2003,"" Gowda added.

Opposition leader Jagadish Shettar and P G R Sindhia (JD-U) took exception to the state government promulgating in a ""hurry.""

""Why is the government taxing the common man to generate resources? There are lakhs of industries which are not registered. The government could have made good the Rs 300 crore deficit due to non-implementation of VAT by ensuring that these industries register,"" Shettar maintained.

AIPJD floor leader B Somasekhar said the government had issued the ordinance without even consulting the sales tax advisory board or Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce (FKCCI).

""An ordinance is issued only in an emergency situation. To safeguard your officers who have failed to manage finances, you have issued this ordinance and burdened the common man,"" he contended.

Chandrakant Bellad (BJP) pointed out that any increase in taxes hit the state''s income. ""Our rates are already higher than those in our neighbouring states. Naturally all trade will move away, if we increase taxes,"" he said.

Shettar felt pilferage would go up in proportion with any hike in taxes. ""By trying to raise Rs 250 crore, you will not even reach your target of Rs 8,000 crore,"" he maintained.

42,Parties support bill for open voting in RS elections,"NEW DELHI: A rare unanimity was on display between the ruling BJP and the main opposition Congress on supporting the Bill for open voting in elections to the Rajya Sabha.

The BJP, Congress and the Samajwadi Party welcomed the Bill arguing that it would end the trend of buying the MLAs'' votes by candidates to reserve their passage to the Rajya Sabha.

Minister of state for law P. C. Thomas, SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and Congress member Pawan Bansal said that the Bill was the only answer to the problem of money power threatening the democratic process. ``The spectacle of MLAs being bought is unfortunate, it is posing a threat to the parties,'''' Yadav said demanding that there be open voting in the legislative councils as well.

However, the BJD, a constituent of the NDA, opposed the Bill arguing that it was not in the interest of the smaller states. B. Mehtab (BJD) said that the sanctity of secret ballot was the essence of elections.

CPM group leader Somnath Chatterjee opposed the Bill terming it as an assault on the spirit of the Constitution. ``You are mutilating the Constitution,'''' he said turning at the treasury benches.

He argued that the Bill would not be able to serve its purpose since candidates with money power would ``buy nominations from the parties.''''

K. Malaichamy (AIADMK) opposed the Bill arguing that it would act against the interest of the states.

43,Synchronised polls 'not a happy idea': Lyngdoh,"NEW DELHI: ``Cheating like hell'''' and ``not a happy idea'''' is how Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh described Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani''s idea of synchronisation of parliamentary and assembly polls on Thursday.

In an interview to PTI, he said the idea is ``anti-democratic in character''''. But he said that if the idea comes formally to the Election Commission, it would discuss it. ``There is no question of our not considering it. As a fact we have to do that,'''' he said.

Lyngdoh also said that if the situation demanded, the EC is prepared to hold Lok Sabha elections anytime. His comment on holding elections anytime assumes importance since unconfirmed reports hinted at Advani taking up the issue of dissolving the Lok Sabha to the Union cabinet.

``There are certain states which need special attention. In terms of electoral records, it is very bad. Obviously, we cannot allow everybody to go to the polls at the same time. It is not a good situation to have everybody going to the polls at the same time. We won''t be able to pay attention. They will cheat like hell and we won''t know what to do with that,'''' Lyngdoh explained.

In any case, he said, why should any state be oriented towards parliamentary elections. ``There is nothing in democracy which says Parliament is more important than an assembly. They all have same weightage. Why should Parliament be not oriented towards assembly elections. So it is not democracy. That is it. You don''t have to be a politician to understand it,'''' Lyngdoh said.

Elaborating on the issue of synchronised polls, Lyngdoh said the EC would implement the idea if ``the government makes constitutional changes''''. Asked whether the commission was in a position to hold Lok Sabha elections along with the five assembly polls this year end, he said: ``There is nothing which is not possible. But it is a question whether it ought to be done. In any case, if you do that, you will be depriving the present Lok Sabha members one year of their term. It can be advanced to February. You make constitutional changes. You can reposition everything. But this is bad. Well, somebody has to suffer.''''

He said the commission is prepared to hold snap polls. ``We have got the electoral rolls ready. But they have to dissolve Parliament and we have got six months after that. It will not be snap for us,'''' he said.

The CEC also said that since a new assembly in one of the five states slated to go to the polls has to be constituted in the first week of December, elections would be end before that.

Lyngdoh also refused to predict what would the campaign issues in the coming elections. Hindutva, Ram temple or Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin: ``I am not an expert in such matters,'''' is how Lyngdoh summed it up.

On the issue of Parliament passing a Bill legalising corporate funding to political parties, Lyngdoh said one has to look into the entire gamut of the issue. ``Somebody has to look whether they have declared the fact to the revenue department. Somebody will have to look into the accounts of expenditure of individual candidates and somebody will have to tally them,'''' he said.
