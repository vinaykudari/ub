2,Uncertainty stares AP cotton farmers,"guntur:with a bumper crop of cotton expected, gloom looms large over farmers who fear a steep decline in prices. it may be mentioned here that the district is already facing a glut of existing stock which has adversely affected the prices. state cotton association president g punnaiah chowdary told the times of india on thursday that with 25 lakh bales of imported cotton cascading into the domestic market, the situation would further deteriorate resulting in the nose diving of prices which would prove detrimental to the grower and the trader. punnaiah chowdary lamented that india had lost its supremacy of being the main exporter of cotton and paradoxically it was now importing 22 lakh bales of cotton because the international price is less and the quality is much better. though the government permitted export of 10 lakh bales of cotton in 2000-2001, hardly one lakh bales were exported. apart from the price, the indian cotton has the stigma of being contaminated. he said the imports might go up to 25 lakh bales in 2001-2002. punnaiah said that there was a carry over stock of 31 lakh bales while new arrivals would begin from november. production is expected to go up to 170 lakh bales this year as against 140 lakh bales in 2000-2001.the average price, he said might drop from rs 16,000 per candy to rs 14,000 per candy. to avert the crisis, punnaiah suggested formation of a cotton board on the lines of the tobacco board to regulate the crop size and ensure a fair price to the growers.

4,All-party meet on weavers’ woes sought,"hyderabad: the state unit of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) has demanded that the government convene an all-party meeting to discuss the problems faced by the handloom sector in the state and take appropriate measures to mitigate the crisis faced by weavers. the bjp has also demanded that the government increase the allocation to the handloom sector from the existing rs 7 crore to rs 100 crore besides taking up housing programmes for weavers. neighbouring states like tamil nadu has allocated rs 200 crore for handloom sector while it is only rs 7 crore in andhra pradesh. moreover, the funds released by the centre to rescue the sector from the ongoing crisis have not been utilised by the government so far,bjp weavers cell convener sriramulu alleged. speaking to reporters here on thursday, sriramulu said that responding to the requests made by the bjp state unit, the centre has agreed to release rs 50 crore for handloom sector. however, only rs 20 crore have been utilised by the state so far.the centre also released expressed readiness to release about rs 20 crore under the deendayal hathkarg yojana scheme for weavers. but, the state is not ready to release the matching grant and take up rescue measures. in addition, the hudco has released about rs 19 crore for taking up housing schemes for weavers and agreed to release even more but the state is not prepared to take the advantage, sriramulu alleged. with the government turning a clod shoulder to weavers problems, andhra pradesh recorded a highest 150 starvation deaths in the last couple of years, he said.

5,'De-linking will hamper development',"pune: while political consideration may determine the various stances that political parties will take on the issue of the delinking of 20 fringe villages from the pune municipal limits announced by the chief minister on wednesday, urban planners and environmentalists see it only in terms of the effect it will have on planned development. ""it is unfortunate that not just political leaders, but even senior government officers have not made sincere efforts to understand why these villages were merged with the pmc and what would be the effects of de-linking,"" said a visibly upset p.g. sardesai, former director, state town planning. mr sardesai ridiculed the criticism that agricultural lands in these villages had been reserved for public amenities and the lands of the builders were set free in the draft development plan (dp). ""this may have happened, but it certainly cannot be an official argument to favour de-linking. the elected members and the state have full rights to amend the dp and incorporate all such reservations which will save the agro-based industry in these fringe villages,"" dr sardesai said. in fact, the emerging metro of pune needs agriculture to supply vegetables to its citizens. hence, in the regional plan, agricultural zones have been marked. thus, if the government officers find that 90 per cent of the land in a village is under cultivation, then they should recommended that the entire land should be reserved for farming in the dp and not that the village should be de-linked, he added. "" whether you delete the villages or not, pune city will continue to grow upto its natural boundaries. the inclusion of villages was the basic step towards integrated planning,"" mr sardesai said. former city engineer m.b. harihar, too, was critical, particularly of the move to de-link five villages partially. this effectively means that constructions in some part of the village will be in accordance with development committee rules of the pmc, while that in other parts will be in accordance with rules framed by the collectorate, mr harihar pointed out. ""we have seen that such a system has led to inconsistency and unplanned development in villages like dhankawadi,"" he added. what about the pmc's failure to provide infrastructural facilities to the villages which has been criticised even by the villagers themselves (see story on page 1). ""for several years, the villages were with the zilla parishad. however, the water supply schemes had to be initiated by the pmc. the villages will not be able to undertake capital intensive projects with the revenue generated at the grampanchayat level,"" mr harihar replied. mr sardesai pointed out that the planners had also recommended the establishment of a pune metropolitan authority or a metropolitan committee to govern and plan the functioning of the pmc, pcmc and cantonments. ""however, no political party is pressing for the establishment of the pmrda which would ensure speedy and effective governance for the city as well as its fringe areas. instead, what we have is a political fight,"" he added. according to environmentalist vijay paranjape the state had neither used any ""rational criteria"" for including the fringe villages in the pmc limits, nor for de-linking them. ""both the inclusion and de-linking of the villages was carried out on an ad hoc basis, which establishes legislative irrationality. it is also a failure of the pmc administration, which failed to convince villagers that the corporation can provide better civic amenities then the gram panchayats,"" mr paranjape said. the de-linking would lead to administrative and socio-economic problems. land records which were maintained by the talathis had been changed into property cards and the villagers had started paying taxes to the pmc. now, the entire exercise will have to be reversed leading to wastage of administrative efforts as well as funds, mr paranjape said. moreover, during the last four years, the socio-economic fabric in these villages had changed and a tendency towards urbanisation was growing. now, suddenly, planners were asking villagers to reverse the entire process. this, according to mr paranjape, was ""unfair treatment"" being meted out to the villagers. when it was pointed out that villagers had welcomed the de-linking by bursting fire crackers, he said, ""they are happy because the dc rules will not apply to them now. at the same time, they will not get the civic amenities either. "" and if the government wants to justify the de-linking on the grounds that these 15 villages are agro-based, well, so are the remaining villages. why was this factor not considered while effecting the merger?"" he questioned.

8,"Jaswant rules out hot pursuit, talks with Pakistan","new delhi: india will continue to exercise restraint on the issue of hot pursuit but feels this is not the right time for either a visit to pakistan or resumption of dialogue. allaying fears that india might cross the border to target terrorist camps in pok, external affairs minister jaswant singh on thursday said for a resumption of dialogue, it was necessary that the weapon of terrorism be discarded. addressing a press conference here, singh ruled out india playing a larger or more direct role in the current us-led campaign or providing forces for it, saying it was neither necessary nor on the cards. nor was india contemplating granting us the right to establish permanent bases as was being feared. ruling out a visit to pakistan in the near future, singh said he had not received a formal invitation and besides both countries were preoccupied with the current developments in afghanistan. on pakistan's desire to discuss kashmir with the us secretary of state colin powell, singh said while pakistan was free to discuss with powell what it wished, jammu and kashmir was not an international issue. india had fought the scourge of terrorism for 20 years and would continue to fight it until it was resolved. with powell, india would discuss the issue of cooperation on counter-terrorism. singh said neutralisation of terrorist bases in afghanistan was of direct interest and benefit to india as it was the al qaida's networks that were operating in j&k. india's skepticism about pakistan's role in the coalition against terrorism was made clear with singh reporting that the two taliban helicopters taken into custody by pakistani authorities had been returned to taliban. singh hoped they would now be used for peaceful purposes. welcoming the recent oic communique condemning terrorism, he expressed optimism that the current campaign against terrorism would be taken to its logical conclusion. the minister also gave ample indication of india's desire to play a role in the future political dispensation of afghanistan. saying that india would like to have a process-based rather than personality-based structure, he said it was necessary to ensure that afghanistan did not once again become a centre that radiated terrorism. while extending support for a broad-based multi-ethnic government, singh rejected the suggestion that a moderate taliban leadership could be part of it, saying the term was an oxymoron. in the immediate future, india would like to significantly enhance its humanitarian assistance to afghanistan by providing one million tonnes of wheat, blankets, quilts and medical services, followed up by active participation in the rehabilitation and reconstruction effort under its itec programme. singh said he was taking up the issue of denial of access to news channels to the indian high commission in islamabad and said he would take up the issue of denial of visas to indian journalists as well.

12,50 injured in Hyderabad violence,"hyderabad/srinagar: at least 50 police personnel, journalists and passers-by were injured when a mob resorted to heavy stone throwing from the precincts of the historic mecca masjid in hyderabad on friday while in srinagar, despite the hurriyat conference's appeal for calm, the kashmir valley witnessed protests and bandhs against the continuing us air raids on afghanistan. in ahmedabad, a group of muslims expressed solidarity with the taliban and attempted to burn the us and uk flags. however the day passed off peacefully in mumbai. in hyderabad, the stone throwing from the mosque continued for well over 40 minutes before the situation was brought under control. over a dozen people who were said to be involved in the incident were taken into custody. trouble began immediately after the conclusion of afternoon prayers when a person from among the worshippers shouted a slogan which was responded by others. soon after, hundreds of youth ran out of the mosque and started raising anti-us slogans. suddenly they started hurling stones at a posse of policemen standing guard near charminar, forcing them to scurry for cover. when the situation threatened to go out of control, the police lobbed teargas shells and fired rubber bullets but the stone throwing continued, injuring a deputy commissioner of police and scores of policemen. the police then charged on the mob, braving stones, barged into the mosque and confined the unruly mob to the main prayer hall. eventually the police provided a safe passage to the hundreds of others stranded in the mosque. in kashmir, the police burst teargas shells to disperse demonstrators at several places. life remained paralysed as shops, business establishments remained closed and private and government transport remained off the road. several government offices also remained closed in defiance of the chief secretary's orders to ensure full attendance. in srinagar itself, some people pelted stones in tangpora, lal chowk and nowhatta areas. effigies of us president george bush and pakistan president pervez musharraf were burnt at maisuma and nowhatta areas in the old city. the chief of women's separatist group dukhtaran-e-milat, aisyia anderabi, appeared at maisuma after the friday prayers and led a protest march chanting pro-osama and anti-us slogans. however, mirwaiz of kashmir and former hurriyat chairman molvi umar farooq during his traditional religious speech at the grand masjid in nowhatta appealed to the us to stop its air raids on afghanistan. in ahmedabad, a small section of the minority community rallied support for afghanistan and taliban by shouting anti-us slogans. their attempt to burn the american flag and the british union jack was, however, foiled by the police. demonstrations were also held in the juhapura area of the city by some 100 muslim youth. though gujarat remained tense, reports from bhuj said that contrary to the indications, prayers went off peacefully in the afternoon. districts like kutch, bharuch, kheda, sabarkantha and banaskantha, which have a dominant minority population, also reported a peaceful friday. friday went off peacefully in mumbai also. discussions with leaders from various communities in mumbai in the past two days helped the police maintain peace and communal harmony in the metropolis, senior ips officers said. the city police had anticipated trouble at certain places like pydhonie, kurla, bandra and jogeshwari after the friday namaaz. ""but we held meetings with religious and political leaders of both communities on wednesday and thursday. the discussions were aimed at seeking support for maintaining communal harmony in mumbai. our efforts have been successful,"" a senior ips officer told times news network.

13,Terrorism is BJP's key plank for UP polls,"new delhi: billboards for the bharatiya janata yuva morcha's two-day convention in agra, starting october 13, say it all: ""utho jago, hey vir hindustani/aao bhagaye simi jaise dalal pakistan ke/ chalo agra (awaken, brave indians/ and drive out pakistani agents such as simi/ let's go to agra)"". it's clear that for the bjp, terrorism will be the key to the assembly elections not just in uttar pradesh, but also in uttaranchal, punjab and jammu and kashmir, slated for 2002. the bjym convention - which will be addressed both by the home minister and the prime minister - will kick-off the campaign. riding piggyback on the terrorist strikes in the us on september 11, the bjp-led government has banned the students' islamic movement of india and re-opened the ayodhya issue. now it seems to be readying to make terrorism its major theme for the next few months. dovetailing with the prime minister's emotional appeal at the all-party meeting on september 27 for a national campaign against terrorism, the bjym launched an anti-terrorism yatra from here on october 2, flagged off by organisational general secretary and now gujarat chief minister narendra modi and which, after wending its way through delhi, haryana and up, will reach agra on october 13. the draft youth policy, which will be discussed in agra, says it will focus on health, education and employment, but the emphasis is very much on inculcating the bjp's brand of nationalism among the youth - taking pride in being indian first and building national character and the stress on ""an awareness campaign against terrorism and population control."" the conflation of terrorism and population control is no accident as they are among the pet issues of the bjp - the objective of which is to prey on the latent fears of a section of the hindus and create a sense of unease among the muslims. expanding on this theme is the suggestion in the draft policy that human rights' ngos be asked why they never raise their voices when innocent civilians are killed by militants (many in fact do) or when security personnel are ambushed. it goes on to add that the bjym supports the home minister's efforts to give protection to the security forces under the law to fight terrorism. and after the bjym convention, the bjp national council, scheduled for october 21 in delhi, and its national executive meeting in amritsar on november 2 will also discuss terrorism at length - indeed, the latter will adopt a resolution on terrorism and give a call to the nation to counter the menace.
