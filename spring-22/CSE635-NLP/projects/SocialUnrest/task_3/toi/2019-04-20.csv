0,Contract killing not ruled out in Kamalia case,"patna: the police are yet to ascertain the reason behind the killing of patna city-based businessmen manoj kamalia even after three days of the incident. although the police believe that contract killers are behind the killing, they have failed to trace the gang involved in the killing. â€œthe use of sophisticated arms in kamaliaâ€™s murder indicates the hand of an organised gang of criminals,â€� remarked city sp o n bhaskar. he confirmed the use of a .45 bore pistol, very rarely used in a murder case, in this killing, adding â€œin any murder case people close to the victim also become suspectsâ€�. kamalia was more popular as a â€œhumanitarianâ€� rather than a businessman at least in the patna city area. according to some residents, he extended economic help to many unemployed youth to start new business and also participated in many social activities in the area. they maintained, â€œhe always tried to keep himself away from any controversy,â€� but added in the same vein, â€œit was kamaliaâ€™s popularity as a â€˜richâ€™ person that led to his endâ€�. the police strongly feel that three dreaded criminals, with possible underworld links, are involved in the kamalia murder case. one of the criminals is also wanted in the murder case of om prakash kamalia, manojâ€™s uncle. the criminals are wanted by the patna police in more than two dozen murder cases lodged with different police stations of the district. earlier, a special police team was sent to nepal to arrest one of the criminals, alleged to also have â€˜political connectionsâ€™.

1,Kalyan riot was waiting to happen,"kalyan: kalyan residents say that the riot that swept the communally sensitive areas of the old township on april 9 was just waiting to happen. old kalyan town, where hindus and muslims live cheek by jowl, had been peaceful since 1984, even had gone up in flames during several religious riots before that. violence returned to the town on april 9, 2002, when a tiff over a fare between bunty chavan, a municipal worker, and a muslim rickshaw driver is said to have triggered off riots that left five persons dead. but local residents now say that the tinder for the communal sparks was provided by the recent political rivalry between shiv sena activist ramesh walunj and nationalist congress party member iqbal shaikh, the corporator from rohidaswada. shaikh and his associate, rasool shaikh (who is an influential cloth merchant) had been sena loyalists before joining the ncp. the two ensured the victory of ramesh walunjâ€™s wife, usha, in the 1995 municipal elections. the ward was then reserved for women. so the sena was jolted iqbal shaikh filed his nomination as an ncp candidate. his victory communalised politics in rohidaswada and ambedkar road, an ancient locality of cobblers and conservancy workers, and also in the muslim locality of doodh naka. problems came to a head when ramesh walunjâ€™s son, umesh, joined the bajrang dal. about four months ago, the police arrested four activists of the studentsâ€™ islamic movement of india from the old town. around the same time, umesh walunj and his uncle, ashok, began to reconstruct a local hanuman temple. clashes also erupted because of a relationship between a muslim girl and a hindu boy.the girl who has now been sent out of town, was allegedly abused both by her own relatives and hindu neighbours for â€œpolluting the communityâ€�. some butchers who allegedly illegally slaughtered cows also frequently invited the wrath of hindu neighbours. pressure started building up on the muslim leadership to â€œprotect the interests of the communityâ€�. kalyan assistant commissioner of police amar jadhav addressed both the communities and extracted a promise from them to protect each othersâ€™ lives and property. a house-to-house search was conducted, but no weapons were found. deputy commissioner of police, kiran shelar, held meetings with religious leaders from both the communities but the peace seemed short-lived. around 10 pm on april 9, bunty chavanâ€™s tiff with the rickshaw driver blew the lid off. street lights on ambedkar road were broken with stones and, in the darkness, ashok walunj was stabbed to death outside his house. his aunt, ambibai walunj, (65), died of shock when she saw him being killed. however, umesh walunj and his family managed to escape. gunny bags dipped in kerosene and petrol bombs were hurled at houses belonging to members of the majority community. in retaliation, some houses belonging to members of the minority community also were burnt. two persons, irshad shaikh and abdul rehman baig, were also found stabbed to death. the police were stationed at a theatre at which maza pati chhatrapati was being staged because the maratha mahasangh was protesting against chhatrapati shivajiâ€™s name being used in the title. the police arrived on the scene but a lathicharge did not help.the riot was controlled only at 2.30 am, when the police fired 14 rounds, killing one woman, nusrat shaikh. the state minorities commission visited the area on monday but refused to term the violence as a riot. â€œit was a loot by anti-social elements since both the communities have been attacked,â€� the commission said. with the peace shattered, though, many kalyan residents are wary about what the future holds.

3,Women make impressive debut in Gaya civic polls,"gaya: if numbers are any indication, women have made an effective presence in the gaya municipal corporation elections. as against 602 men, no less than 246 members of the fair sex are in the fray for the 36 wards that go to polls on april 28. though the gaya municipal corporation came into existence in november 1983, the first election will be held only now. the presence of a large number of women candidates in a situation in which two of the most dreaded jailbirds of the town have already been elected uncontested, makes the courage of the women more pronounced. no less interesting is the fact that the gaya women have also come forward to contest municipal elections from seats which are not reserved for women. though quite a few women candidates are seen doing proxy for their husbands in true rabri devi style, there are others like kiran verma and bilqis jehan who pose an open challenge to the proxy syndrome. in fact, kiran verma''s main election plank is to expose the female mask from her rivals in ward no. 19. verma has been campaigning for an independent woman who can be more than a doting wife. targeting her main rival who is believed to have been put up by her political-activist husband, kiran has established an instant rapport with the new woman. shun the women who only amplify the masters'' voice and need constant prompting to deliver words, she advises her voters. the message is generally well received. but her offensive against male chauvinism and the proxy culture have also created enemies within the large number of status quoists, including women, who see female submissiveness as a virtue necessary for conjugal bliss and a happy family. ""agar kisi ka pati rajniti me uski madad karta hai to isme harj kya hai (if a husband helps the wife in her political activities, there is no harm in it),"" says a woman voter of ward no. 19 who is reluctant to be in direct confrontation with kiran''s campaign theme. still, there are areas in which women candidates are conspicuously absent. ward numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 21, 23, 31, 32, 34, 35 and 36 do not have a single woman candidate. it is to be seen how women candidates fare in the non-reserved seats.

4,RJDLP meet remains inconclusive,"patna: the rjd legislative party (rjdlp) meeting at the chief ministerâ€™s house on friday remained inconclusive with the allocation of votes not being made to the six candidates, including one from the congress. around 80 mlas attended the meeting in which unity in the party was emphasised to ensure the victory of its candidates. lalooâ€™s brother-in-law and party mla sadhu yadav boycotted the meeting, protesting against the the selection of the candidates. the meeting of the legislative wing of the party is expected to continue for few more days. earlier, efforts to woo sadhu yadav to attend the rjdlp meeting proved futile. parliamentary affairs minister ram chandra purbey reportedly tried to convince sadhu to attend the meeting but sadhu remained unrelenting, sticking to his stand. according to sources close to sadhu, the bihar cmâ€™s rebel brother is now demanding the deletion of â€œextraâ€� rjd candidate niranjan kushwahaâ€™s name from the candidatesâ€™ list. it would ensure smooth sailing for the remaining five candidates, sources added. sadhuâ€™s supporters pointed out that in the last rajya sabha polls, three rjd candidates, including laloo, had polled 133 first preference votes. â€œwith the partyâ€™s strength decreasing by two and the cross votes from the jd (u) unlikely to come, the sixth candidate of the party is unlikely to make it. there are no extra mlas. does laloo expect to get the mlas from up and west bengal?â€� asked a sadhu aide, insisting that a minimum of 24 mlas are to be allotted for one candidate to ensure the smooth sailing of the candidates.

6,Visitors to rate govt officials in Haryana,"chandigarh: haryana government has decided to introduce an appraisal scheme under which visitors to government offices will give their rating of officers through feedback forms. the higher education department has already introduced this scheme under which every visitor to its office is given a small feedback form by the receptionist to enable him to comment on the quality of delivery of service. the forms are both in hindi and english. each such feedback form is given a serial number which is entered against the name of the visitor, who has to mention the name of the officer he or she had interacted with during the visit and rate the official concerned on certain parameters such as courtesy, politeness, promptness in attending to the complaint. all departmental heads have been directed to follow this pattern under which they are to have a designated place for officials to meet visitors. the filled up feedback forms are to be kept in a special box which would be opened by a designated officer after the office hours. daily rating report would be computerised and at the end of fortnight, a summary of the feedback report of each officer concerned would be prepared and conveyed to him. in case of an adverse rating, copies of the report would be sent to the next senior officer who could provide guidance to the official for improvement. the appraisal scheme had been approved by a committee headed by the chief secretary.the scheme had been necessitated in light of the changing environment and perceptions about the government functioning which requires greater promptness and transparency. the district officials have been warned that the number of people coming to the secretariat here from their districts will ultimately determine their efficiency and responsiveness. in addition, the administrative secretaries have been assigned districts where they are supposed to monitor the progress of various welfare schemes undertaken by government departments.

7,State BJP ready for polls: Rana,"ahmedabad: though chief minister narendra modi has deferred the decision on holding snap polls, perhaps due to pressure from nda partners, the ruling bharatiya janata party is prepared for assembly elections at any given time. state bjp president rajendrasinh rana, who had earlier announced plans for fresh elections as decided in the bjp''s national executive committee meeting in goa, has no regrets that the state cabinet deferred the election since the final authority on the matter is the chief minister. when asked about his reaction on deferment on the crucial issue, rana said, ""nothing is final in politics. the priority for the time being is that of restoration of peace and communal harmony and not of election. but one thing is certain that the organisational set up is fully prepared to face elections at any given time."" the party''s central leadership has already hinted that elections in gujarat would be held sometime in september.

""the people have reposed faith in gram panchayat elections as more than 75 per cent of the panchayats have been grabbed by the supporters of the bharatiya janata party. the concept of samras villages has been accepted by the rural folks"", rana said, adding, ""the arrival of modi in the state arena has enthused new life in the organisation and the chief minister has been drawing crowds at all the party meetings he has addressed in the last six months."" senior leaders of the party have been assigned their work and they have been regularly conducting group meetings and conventions in the four zones in which the state has been divided. the party has at the same time continued its dialogue with frontal organisations who had actively campaigned in rajkot from where modi has been elected to the state assembly.

8,TDP govt doubts Naxals’ sincerity,"hyderabad: the spate of naxalite activities in the state during the past one month have caused considerable worry to the state government which feels that the outlawed peopleâ€™s war (pw) group was not serious in taking the initiative of talks any further. highly placed sources feel that the naxalites had demanded that there should be no combing operations so that they could go ahead with their activities like blasting landmines, assaulting villagers, beating up tribals, and killing leaders belonging to political parties unhindered. the sources say that a study of the pattern of their activities in the last one month clearly indicated that they were bereft of any strategy. in the latest incident of killing of bjp leader r balreddy in sircilla town of karimnagar district, a new element came to light. the naxalites were bringing prepared letters and were filling the column under the heading â€˜nameâ€™ in hand, after the killing. this indicates that they had not specifically targeted anyone. statistics available here indicate that from march 13 to date, the naxalites were involved in about 19 incidents. of this, seven incidents took place in karimnagar, two in srikakulam, two in adilabad, two in east godavari, one each in visakhapatnam, nalgonda, medak, warangal, guntur, and vemulawada. the police action against naxalite activities during the same period happened in 18 incidents in adilabad, nalgonda, srikakulam, nizamabad, cudda-pah, mahabubnagar and medak. the naxalite activities included blasting of an mro office, blasting of landmines, setting on fire of telephone exchanges, blasting tirumala engineering college, assault on villagers who resisted setting of telephone exchanges on fire, blast in the house of a mallikarjun, tdp president of water users association, blast of ap paper mill quarters and staff quarters etc. the police action included unearthing of landmines and exchange of fire with naxalites during combing operations. these incidents, the sources point out, makes it clear that while the government was keen that naxals come forward for talks, there was no change in the attitude of naxalites. however, in view of the recent incidents, the government may convene a meeting of all political parties to review the situation.

10,Taslima blasts Bangla govt for distorting history,"kolkata: exiled bangladeshi writer taslima nasreen on friday criticised the khaleda zia governmentâ€™s decision to remove sheikh mujibur rahmanâ€™s portraits from government offices. speaking to tnn in kolkata, nasreen said the move was an effort by the new government to distort history. following a recent order, mujibâ€™s portraits were removed from all government offices. ruling bnp mp shamsul alam pramanik introduced a private membersâ€™ bill in bangladeshâ€™s jatiya sangsad on march 7. it sought repeal of the father of the nationâ€™s portrait (exhibition and preservation) act, 2001. â€œyou cannot disregard the contribution made by shiekh mujib,â€� nasreen said. drawing parallels with mahatma gandhi she argued that one might not agree with gandhiâ€™s ideals and work, but it was not possible to obliterate him from public memory. â€œsuch things never succeed. history repeats itself,â€� she said. nasreen, who is in exile, added that bangladesh was now beset with a myriad of problems and the controversy over mujibur was the governmentâ€™s way of diverting public attention from more pressing issues. though nasreen is eager to return to her homeland, she saw no such possibility in the near future.
