0,Study group to submit draft on social security policy,"bangalore: in 1991, parduman singh, an aituc leader and member of central board of trustees of the employees provident fund organisation wrote to r.k.a. subrahmanya, former additional secretary with the union ministry of labour, suggesting a body be formed to promote social security. subrahmanya''s support saw the formation of the social security association of india in july 1991 with 18 members. the association has since grown into an organisation with about 300 members comprising social security institutions esic and epfo, trade unions and trade union leaders, industrialists and management consultants, public administrators among others. the objective of the association is to create awareness among workers about social security programmes in india and abroad. social security is a basic human right. ""we want the government to recognise social security as a fundamental right,"" says r.k.a. subrahmanya. ssai holds seminars, symposia, workshops and debates to focus on the need to expand social security coverage and improve governance of social security programmes. the association conducts educational programmes in local languages. following the lead of ssai, discussions are held on social security at various levels. subrahmanya says there is a greater need for social security in developing countries than in developed ones. and india requires social security of broader dimension than elsewhere. he explains, ""in developed countries, social security is seen as an income maintenance measure to protect the income of workers in case of sickness etc - when a person unable to work is deprived of his income. in developing countries where the workforce belongs mostly to the unorganised sector - without regular employment, continuity of employment and assurance of a basic income - assurance of means of livelihood is of greater importance."" lately, with efforts at highlighting conditions of people in the unorganised sector, the government has initiated measures for providing social security. it is still far from providing comprehensive social security. the centre set up the national commission on labour of india to recommend the minimum level of protection and welfare measures. subrahmanya was appointed chairman of a study group to recommend measures for extending social security coverage to the unorganised sector. the study group recommended the constitution of a national social security authority of india to formulate the national policy on social security, and monitoring implementation of the policy. it has recommended establishment of boards of social security for implementation of the policy. kerala is in the forefront in providing social security to workers in the unorganised sector. it has set up welfare funds for classes of workers like headload construction workers and also a committee to review working of the funds. subrahmanya was a member of the committee, which recommended consolidation of funds. the government constituted a labour authority of kerala for administration of the funds. there is a proposal to set up a similar authority in karnataka. further progress depends on the action the centre will take on recommendations of the national commission on labour, after it submits its report sometime in february.

1,"CM, minister take language fanatics to task","bangalore: ""when the government''s language policy is clear, why should statements be issued to the contrary?"" - chief minister s.m. krishna. ""i have found that all those who spoke against english at the kannada sahitya sammelana actually send their children to english schools."" - primary and secondary education minister h. vishwanath. these were the painful, somewhat angry, words spoken at a function on the international mother tongue day here on thursday. those who came under attack were kannada activists pursuing their goals without sincerity. the chief minister said those who use linguistic pride are creating confusion over government''s language policy. ``when our policy is so clear, why create confusion?'''' the government is committed to providing education in the mother tongue for classes i to v. english or kannada will be introduced as a compulsory subject in kannada- or english-medium schools, he maintained. reiterating that the importance of mother tongue cannot be undermined, krishna said it''s sad a public debate on that is still on. the debate assumes gigantic proportions when it comes to the issue of schools. ``we should let people analyse the situation,'''' he pointed out. on implementing the kannada development authority''s report, krishna said the government has already decided to follow a few recommendations. ``they are all in the bureaucratic pipeline. with bureaucracy, nothing works fast. but we will try to issue a government order within a month.'''' primary and secondary education minister h. vishwanath took to task litterateurs who believed in criticising english but continued to send their children to english-medium schools. ``such litterateurs have only mastered the art of criticism. instead, they should try to develop different forms of spoken kannada,'''' he said. the government is taking action against schools teaching in english medium after obtaining permission for kannada medium. the kannada development authority (kda) has also been given powers to take suo motu action against such schools, vishwanath explained. earlier, kda chairman baraguru ramachandrappa asked the government to evolve an education policy to bridge the gap in education being provided by government and private schools and also between professional and research-based education.

3,Has anti-leprosy plant become extinct?,"lucknow: alectra parasitica - a plant of unusual medicinal importance has been used by locals and vaidyas to cure leprosy and other skin diseases since times immemorial. however, a recent search for the plant in possible areas around chitrakoot and banda in central india failed to reveal a single specimen. moreover, another fresh extensive exploration of the flora of bundelkhand by scientists from different institutes failed to yield anything. among its attributes, the plant has also helped in curing tuberculosis, paralysis, oedema, intestinal worms, constipation, hypertension, piles, leucorrhoea and glands perpurial disorders. s.n. mishra, ex-dean, mahatma gandhi chitrakoot gramoday university, while talking to this newspaper said that once a foreign scientist had visited the department of botany of gramoday university. during discussions, the scientist had stated that alectra parasitica had become extinct and was not to be found anywhere in the world. however, mishra said that till 1995, a few plants of this rare variety were found growing in chitrakoot forests. he said that till the year 2000, they were watching the plant carefully in the surrounding natural habitat, where only a few plants were growing with the nirgundi bushes. but in a recent survey of different possible habitats of alectra parasitica in chitrakoot, they failed to get even a single plant. the natural habitat had been destroyed and the nirgundi bushes had either been ruthlessly cut down and collected by local villagers or destroyed by authorities for different developmental projects. â€œnow we are not sure whether this plant is surviving in nature,â€� lamented mishra and added, â€œthough it is very late, we must not loose any time to protect alectra parasitica from extinction if at all it is surviving anywhereâ€�. so far no efforts have been made to conserve this medicinally important plant by any government or non government agency, claimed mishra. he suggested that tapping of important minerals and forest wealth must be properly managed so as to cause minimal disturbances to the ecology. strict measures should also be taken against illegal, haphazard and unorganised recovery of the natural wealth, he stated.

15,Corporate India welcomes labour law amendments,"new delhi: corporate india enthusiastically welcomed the cabinet's approval to amend the industrial disputes act 1947, terming it as the biggest step in the labour reform process. the decision will enable companies, having up to 1,000 employees, to retrench without getting prior approval from the government. industry observers said this would benefit almost 90 per cent of the indian companies which have less than 1,000 employees. the biggest beneficiaries would be top corporate houses as well as a number of family-owned companies and medium enterprises. cii president and v-c of rpg group sanjiv goenka said the cabinet's decision is a shot in the arm for the sagging industrial sector.''to a great extent it will help in providing the much needed flexibility to the corporates especially in a downturn,'' goenka said. ''this bold act will lead to greater new employment opportunities and help the industry to employ labour using technology and have greater reliance on human capital,'' ficci president rs lodha said. lodha said the decision coming just a week before the budget will send a strong signal to investors —small medium and large - that the government is determined to boost investment in sick enterprises. the second generation reforms have started with a bang,'' said lodha. assocham president kk nohria said this was a step in the right direction, though not adequate. nohria suggested introduction of an appropriate legislation in the forthcoming budget session of the parliament. he said the provision of 45 days wages for workers, taking it up from 15 days, in case of retrenchment or layoff or closure, is a good move. assocham chief expressed hope that the government will bring amendment in the contract labour (regulation and abolition) act to provide outsourcing of various jobs and to permit engagement of contract labour wherever necessary, without legal obligation to absorb them. ''one draconian law has gone,'' said an industry captain. ''it will help us to mutually solve disputes with workers with flexibility,'' he added. industry has been stressing the need for lifting the embargo on retrenchment and closure. ficci said this move would allow industry to restructure itself and come out from sickness. there are more than 3 lakh industrial units which are sick. an estimated amount of rs 20,000 crore is locked in such units. the amendment was essential to turn these around again, at least to unlock the assets lying idle there. the existing law allows such flexibility to units employing less than 100 persons.. the restrictive clause came in the form of an amendment to the industrial disputes act 1947. a new chapter v b was added in 1976, during emergency, which required government's prior permission for retrenchment and closure in industrial units employing more than 300 workers. another amendment in 1982 brought down the number from 300 to 100. these two amendments affected adversely industrial restructuring. corporate india now hopes that other critical amendment of the contract labour act would also be carried out soon.

16,How the mouse co-ordinates personality clashes,"bangalore: when abhishek bachchan, sunil gavaskar, raveena tandon and karan johar sit on the jury for india''s biggest and only personality contest for men, grasim mr india 2002, they will not be plodding through sheafs of paper and scrawling the scores for each of the final 30 contestants. the show, held for the very first time in bangalore, will be bolstered by technology in the selection process. unlike the hunks on the catwalk who kick up stardust as they strut their stuff, this software package ripples with understated grace somewhere in the back end. ready to take on live performances by one of the world''s best gymnastic teams from romania, scintillating dances by namrata shirodkar, sonali kulkarni and others. armed with sleek laptops, the 11-member jury will be using a software that will take care of the entire scoring process, specially created for this personality contest by birla technologies, the software arm of the kumaramangalam birla group. infosys is another background player. when a contestant swaggers in, all details like cv, vital stats, ambition in life, attitude to women will be instantly downloaded onto the screen so that the judge knows the contestant from every angle. the software enables a slick rating mechanism. points given for one category, say mr physique, would have various differentiators like skin, tone, muscles, chest and so on. these would be computed at blazing speeds and the weighted average will be thrown up. at the same time, points given for categories like best smile, photogenic, physique, best dressed male, talent and most popular choice will also be evaluated and added to the overall average ensuring that scoring by judges is more balanced and spread evenly across all the contestant''s attributes. says sunil ballara, vice-president, birla technologies, ""we worked on this package for over six months, have tweaked it so that it is just the perfect solution, taking care of every aspect of the show like security, access mechanism, data backups and algorithms for various analysis needed. and, we have been using it right from the preliminary rounds when about 15,000 applications came in."" interestingly, the software can detect patterns in scoring, say, if there was a judge who gave extra points to a contestant from delhi or laid too much emphasis on the outfit alone, it would be reflected in the final analysis. and, the software also has the live option where the scoring can be simultaneously broadcast to the audience as in the olympics or other sporting events. so at this show where personality counts, the tiny mouse is a sure winner __ its movements and clicks beat any stunning hunk that strides the catwalk. according to officials from planet m, handling the local promotions for the event, ""we always connect with something youthful and full of fun. this is a different kind of experience for us and it is not just the looks __ the whole personality is involved, judges and it too.""
