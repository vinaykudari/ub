0,OGH lacks medical equipment,"HYDERABAD: The Osmania General Hospital is not equipped to function as a teaching college, if norms laid down by the Medical Council of India are strictly adhered to.

The hospital, which is one of the biggest teaching colleges in the state, provides practical training to nearly 200 Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students of the medical college attached to the institution.

The Medical Council of India has stipulated the minimum amount of equipment that must be made available to every 100 students in Minimum Standard Requirements for Medical Colleges, published in 1999.

Some of the basic life saving equipment that must be present in the Medicine Department alone, as per the MCI norms, include 30 BP apparatus, 12 bedside cardiac monitoring units, eight glucometres, 12 defibrillators, 12 ambu bags and 12 ECG machines.

According to norms, the OGH should have at least double this quantity as it admits nearly 200 medicos every year.

According to sources in the OGH, there are not more than 20 BP apparatuses in the entire medicine department, including the emergency wards and general wards. According to norms, there should be at least 60 BP apparatuses, an indication of the state of affairs in the hospital.

Not much different is the case with other gadgets. The OGH has only one bedside cardiac monitoring unit, when norms state at least 24 units are required. The available one too is not functioning to the satisfaction of the doctors.

Similarly, of the required 24 ambu bags, only 12 are available. the entire hospital has only four ECG machines, when 12 are needed.

According to medical students undergoing training at the OGH, they havenâ€™t seen even a single glucometre while the MCI norms state that the hospital must have at least 16 of them. â€œAs per the norms, there should be one â€˜treadmill test machineâ€™ for testing the endurance of cardiac patients. Interestingly, the hospital has one of these machines, which was bought to fulfil the MCI norms, but it has not been working properly for several years now,â€� a resident doctor said.

Most of the above mentioned MCI norms are for medical colleges having only under-graduate course (MBBS). In addition to MBBS, OGH has several specialities in post graduate medicine like Doctor of Medicine (MD) and Master of Surgery (MS). Apart from this, Osmania also has several super speciality courses.

As per MCI regulations, if there are post-graduate and super speciality courses, the hospital should have additional equipment and facilities for those students. In fact, OGH has several equipments when it comes to the super speciality sections, but the MBBS students are not allowed to freely make use of these facilities.

2,Six hardcore criminals arrested,"LUCKNOW: The Aliganj police on Sunday arrested six persons in connection with attempted robbery of a motorcycle.

Hardcore criminals, the six admitted to their involvement in at least half a dozen cases of robbery, murder and extortion in Faizabad, Bara Banki, Sultanpur and Lucknow.

Reports said that one Deepak Agarwal of Bada Chandganj lodged an FIR with the Madiaon police stating that three armed youths attempted to rob him near engineering college crossing but sped towards Residency on a Hero Honda motorcycle when he raised an alarm.

Deepak had gone to his sector-H plot and was returning when he was accosted. Deepak immediately called up the police control room.

Acting on the wireless message directing extensive checking of vehicles by SSP Rajiv Ranjan Verma, circle officer (CO) Aliganj spotted three youths riding a motorcycle.

When the youth tried to escape after spotting the police vehicle, he directed station officers (SOs) of Vikas Nagar, Madiaon and Aliganj police stations namely BP Yadav, Sajjad Naqvi and AK Shahi to enhance patrolling in their areas.

With the SSP personally monitoring the checking drive, SO Aliganj AK Shahi finally spotted and nabbed the three.

The accused identified themselves as Dipanker Rao Gautam of Vikasnagar, Amit Saxena of Secretariat Colony, Indiranagar and Mayur Dwivedi of Pandey Tola, Aliganj.

The motorcycle which they were riding was found to be stolen from Patrakarpuram crossing on March 16. Country-made pistols and bullets were also found in their possession.

SP Trans-Gomati Dinesh Chandra Dubey, who supervised the recovery of firearms and interrogation of the accused, said the three confessed of planning a kidnapping in Lucknow.

3,Vadodara's polls get a royal touch,"VADODARA: After much speculation, two scions of the former Baroda state joined the BJP on Sunday.

Samarjitsinh Gaekwad and his mother Shubanginiraje joined the party in the presence of top leaders including president Venkaiah Naidu.

""She expressed her desire to join the BJP and we welcome her,"" Naidu said, adding the two would campaign for the party in the Lok Sabha elections. ""The BJP is strong in Gujarat and this family''s entry will give the party more strength.""

Shubhanginiraje, who lost the 1996 Lok Sabha election as an Independent from Vadodara, said, ""The BJP has already declared its candidate from Vadodara and we did not join the party on the condition that I should contest the polls. I am happy campaigning for the party.""

Asked if he would have liked to contest the election this time around, Samarjitsinh told TNN on the phone from Delhi, ""It is still early days in politics for me. I will first have to learn the ropes.""

The names of the two Gaekwads were being circulated in BJP circles for the past three days, but leaders were reluctant to make the announcement without completing the formalities.

Samarjitsinh said he would like to concentrate on working for the party and grow with the organisation. Shubhanginiraje, however, is not new to the BJP.

Her last-minute decision to enter the electoral fray as an Independent had altered many equations.

Although she finished third behind Satyajit Gaekwad and Jitendra Sukhadia, she had managed to garner a large chunk of the votes.

""The presence of the erstwhile rulers of Baroda state in the campaigning will definitely make a difference,"" city BJP president Shabdasharan Bhramhatt told TNN. ""As the Maharani of Baroda state, Shubhanginiraje has influence in many sections of society here.""

Bhrambhatt disagreed that duo command more influence in the large Maharashtrian community of Vadodara, saying their scope was much larger.

5,Make states party to jailbreak cases: SC,"NEW DELHI: Concerned with cases of jailbreak in different parts of the country, the Supreme Court on Monday asked a public interest petitioner to make all the state governments parties in a litigation alleging that such incidents were taking place because of nexus among politicians, police, bureaucrats and criminals.

This nexus, the petitioner claimed, was rising at an alarming rate. A Bench of Justices N Santosh Hegde and B P Singh adjourned hearing on Manzoor Ali Khanâ€™s petition for a week. The Bench said responsibility for incidents of jailbreak lay mainly with the states and hence they should be made parties in the petition.

Khanâ€™s counsel DK Garg said, â€˜â€˜The spate of jailbreaks across the country in the past two months has not only exposed the security and state of Indian jails but also raised serious concern about the security, sovereignty and integrity of the country.â€™â€™
