0,Improvement trust heads to meet minister,"LUDHIANA: The heads of improvement trusts in Punjab on Saturday finally decided to apprise the Punjab local bodies minister about removing bureaucratic bottlenecks which have rendered them ineffective in discharging their powers for the larger purpose of improving their work performance.

Addressing newspersons after a meeting at circuit house here on Saturday, their spokesperson and chairman, improvement trust, Bathinda, Jagroop Singh Gill informed about their decision to hold a final meeting with the local bodies minister Chaudhary Jagjit Singh at Jalandhar on September 13 in this regard.

They had already deliberated over the issue in the meeting organised at Bhatinda. He expressed confidence about the positive outcome of the meeting with the minister.

The chairmen of 10 trusts â€” Ludhiana, Nabha, Abohar, Malerkotla, Barnala, Khanna, Gurdaspur, Moga, Faridkot, Patiala, Kapurthala, Phagwara, Bathinda and Jalandhar were present.

They unanimously chose chairman improvement trust, Jalandhar, and district Congress president Tejinder Singh Bittu as their president and authorised him to work out modalities of the proposed meeting with the minister.

Interestingly, a suggestion also came up during the meeting to move the court if their meeting with the minister failed to produce positive outcome.

The chairmen are sore over inhibitions caused in their way of working allegedly due to various directions of top bureaucrats of the department superseding the Act empowering them to carry out their responsibilities. They are of the view that removal of uncalled for bureaucratic intervention could facilitate working of trusts, which are public dealing bodies and help contributing to the public-friendly and corruption-free image of their government.

Though the Act governing the working of trusts empowers their chairmen in making recruitments but this was usurped by the department bureaucrats. The section 18 of the Act vests power of making appointments of employees up to class III jobs with them but these posts were provincialised empowering the department authorities to make appointments and order transfers,

Gill said.. Similarly, they objected to powers given to MCs to pass building plans of residential colonies developed by the trusts despite the provisions of the Act stating the MCs were responsible for the maintenance part only.

1,NSUI sweeps DUSU elections,"NEW DELHI: One saw more green than saffron as Congress-backed National Studentâ€™s Union of India (NSUI) made a clean sweep of all the four posts in the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) elections, the results of which were announced on Saturday. A definite set back to saffron dominance in DUSU polls over past years.

The right-wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) had bagged all the four DUSU posts about twice since direct elections began in DU in the early 1970s. NSUI has done it for the second time this year after 2000.

With assembly elections round the corner, the victory has boosted the morale of the Congress. More so because Congress backed groups wrested the post of the DU Teachers Association (DUTA) president as well.

The new DUSU president is Rohit Choudhary, a Law centre-I student of the Law faculty. Choudhary was the DUSU joint secretary in 2001. He defeated his nearest ABVP rival, Shital Sharda, by a record margin of 12,951 votes.

â€˜â€˜Our immediate priorities will be introduction of health insurance for students at an annual premium of Rs 1 and opening more evening colleges,â€™â€™ said Choudhary.

Narinder Tokas won the vice-presidential seat by defeating his nearest INSO rival by more than 5,000 votes.

But the star of the NSUI sweep clearly was Ragini Nayak, the new DUSU secretary, who is a History (Hons) student of Kirori Mal college. She trounced her ABVP rival by more than 15,600 votes. Her emphasis would be to open women development cells in co-ed colleges.

Pankaj Kochhar of NSUI bagged the post of joint secretary from his nearest INSO rival by over 6,000 votes.

But why did ABVP do so badly? â€˜â€˜We do not have the kind of involvement of national leaders that the NSUI had, nor did we have funds,â€™â€™ said ABVPâ€™s presidential candidate Shital Sharda. NSUI, she alleged, has not fought these as student elections, rather the Congress seems to have fought these as assembly elections.

2,"Northwest police cracks 35 cases, with 5 arrests","NEW DELHI: The northwest district claimed to have busted an interstate gang of criminals allegedly involved in over 35 cases of robbery, dacoity and murder. One of the accused is a Delhi Police constable posted at the Shakarpur police station.

According to deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Sanjay Singh, the gang had been active in western Uttar Pradesh (UP), Haryana and Delhi for the past five years. Twenty-two cases reported in Delhi, eight in Haryana and six cases registered in UP have been solved with the arrests.

The gang had committed some sensational crimes, including 31 robberies and the murder of a village pradhanâ€™s son in Gurgaon. According to Singh, most of the robberies carried out by the accused, involved large sums of money, usually over Rs 1 lakh. The police apparently received information that the kingpin of the gang, and a wanted UP gangster, Vikrant, would try to commit a dacoity in the Delhi State Cooperative Bank at Shahbad Daulatpur. The accused was expected to reach the spot along with a few accomplices in two cars, a Santro and an Indica.

The vehicles were reportedly spotted at about 11 am. The accused tried to flee and also fired at the police, but were ultimately intercepted and arrested near the T-point on Futa road in Prahlad Vihar. Three pistols, one dagger, two knives and several cartridges were recovered from the accused.

Out of the five persons arrested, three are graduates, with Vikrant having completed his graduation from Delhi Universityâ€™s Rajdhani College in 2000. The gang had robbed many businessmen in the city taking large amounts of cash in most incidents and also motor vehicles in some cases.

The gangâ€™s latest criminal act in Delhi had been a robbery in which the accused forcibly took Rs 3 lakhs from a shop owner. They had reportedly also stolen several vehicles in the capital and also robbed Rs 5 lakh at gun-point from a private companyâ€™s cashier in March this year.

3,Abolishing English will be a setback: Principals,"NEW DELHI: Academicians have reacted sharply to HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshiâ€™s plea for abolishing English as a medium of education. Doing away with English as a medium of instruction will deliver a global set back to India. Especially when countries like Russia, China and Japan, which have traditionally taught their languages, are waging a campaign for English, school principals said.

Joshi made the statement while giving away the annual CBSE awards to teachers on Thursday. He said the medium of instruction should be the national language or oneâ€™s own mother tongue so that the child does not have to work doubly hard at grasping the language and then the subject.

â€˜â€˜India has a lot to offer to the world of literature, arts and sciences but today, we are oblivious to our heritage,â€™â€™ he added. But academicians see a contradiction in his approach. â€˜â€˜On one hand, the government is allowing the advent of MNCs and encouraging privatisation, on the other hand, they come up with this. The plea for abolishing English is in total contradiction,â€™â€™ said Springdales (Dhaula Kuan) principal Jyoti Bose.

Shri Ram School (Gurgaon) principal Abha Adams said the worth of the English language can be judged by the fact that thousands of English learning institutes have mushroomed in a town like Ludhiana. â€˜â€˜English is an international language. Abolishing it will set us back rather than forward,â€™â€™ Adams added. According to Bose, English is the â€˜â€˜inâ€™â€™ thing in the global village. â€˜â€˜I can understand the plea to instruct students in their mother tongue, but not the national language. For a non-Hindi speaking student, studying in Hindi will be as foreign as studying in English,â€™â€™ she said.

Delhi Public School (R K Puram) principal Shayama Chona agreed: â€˜â€˜India has been at a great advantage because of English. Moreover, most higher education books are in English.â€™â€™ Whatâ€™s important is that we, Indians have the strength of a three language formula. â€˜â€˜Researchers have found that till the age of 10, a child can pick up as many as 10 languages,â€™â€™ Chona said. Hence, it is important for the students to be given choices. Moreover, if the results of English medium and Hindi medium schools are compared, the former would emerge winners, Bose added, vanquishing the entire argument.

St Thomasâ€™ principal C Manoharan said the importance of English could not be undermined since it was an important factor in getting us Independence. â€˜â€˜If we hadnâ€™t got educated and become aware of what was happening in the world, the Independence struggle would not have panned out as it did,â€™â€™ she said.

4,Will anti-incumbency factor derail Kang sympathy wave?,"CHANDIGARH: Will the anti-incumbency factor prevail in Panjab University or the Kang sympathy wave would be enough to revert the trend?

In the direct elections revived only in 1997, its just once that the same party has managed to repeat the feat by retaining the council. If in 1997 it was Munish Anand from Panjab University Students Union (PUSU), in 1998 and 1999 it was D P S Randhawa of Students Organisation Of Panjab University (SOPU). However, in the subsequent years, the students voted the ruling party out. In 2000, it was the turn of PUSU to get the better of SOPU with Bhupinder Bhuppi winning over Bhupinder Beniwal. And in 2001 it was SOPUâ€™s turn with Santokhwinder Singh Nabha winning.

The year 2002 saw Malwinder Singh Kang of PUSU defeating Harveer Singh of SOPU with a huge margin of 866 votes for the post of president.

The president of the outgoing council and the presidential candidate of the PUSU for the third time in a row, Malwinder Singh Kang is riding high on the sympathy wave after the attack on him and his supporters more than a month ago. With broken teeth, Kang is seen campaigning on the campus, though talking little about the attack. â€˜â€˜While in recent years the anti-incumbency factor has been strong, there are incidents where the candidates have won twice also. We are highlighting our achievements which I am sure are good enough for the students to vote us back to power,â€™â€™ said Kang.

However, the formation of alliances could make the real difference. Kang did not win alone last year, but it was with the joint alliance between PUSU, HSA and HPSU. A similar situation does not prevail this year.

HPSU has decided to join hands with ABVP and HSA has so far struck to going alone by fielding their own candidate.

On the SOPU front, the party has a tough task at hand of brushing aside allegations levelled on its presidential candidate Khushbaz Singh Jattana. The fluorescent posters all over the campus, apart from asking the plain support, explain to the electorate about his â€˜innocenceâ€™.

8,Writing on masjid wall fuelled violence,"GODHRA: Time seems to have no effect on the wounds that the Sabarmati Express carnage created more than one and a half years back in Godhra.

Friday evening''s communal violence has only deepened already existing scars where even a minor incident can shatter the peace here.

A familiar sequence of instigation sent tempers soaring and a string of violent incidents followed in the town during the Ganesh immersion ceremony.

As the procession started passing through the Rani Masjid area at Kolak Bazar, some of the people allegedly started writing ''Jay shree Ram'' and ''Ram Lulla'' on the walls of the masjid with charcoal. A resident tried to stop them from doing so leading to the violence.

The residents later erased the writing but on Saturday morning a hazy Jay Shree Ram could still be seen on the walls. People said they erased the writing as soon as they could to avoid more tension. But on Saturday several shops remained closed in areas that were not under curfew.

""In the past few months people had started commuting through areas dominated by the other community. Now, it is back to the old days when people only moved in their own areas,"" said Y A Gora, a cable operator.

He said that things seemed very normal till the 51st Ganesh idol arrived. ""Then people suddenly became aggressive with heavy rioting near the Rani Masjid,"" he said.

Jabir Ganglu, staying near the masjid said, ""The rift will only increase now. This town seems to have been cursed."" Raju Darji, a BJP councillor adds, ""The bitterness of the Sabarmati carnage still lingers here. The riots are a fallout of this bitterness.""

Caught in the eye of this storm is BJP MLA Haresh Bhatt who is surprisingly being criticised by both communities. Bhatt''s presence with armed guards during the procession and the derogatory slogans that many of his supporters shouted was the main instigation, say Muslims.

On the other hand members of the Hindu community are not happy either. ""He could not restrain the police when it started action against those in the procession. This is against whatever he said during the electioneering,"" said a resident of Sonivad. Five people were injured in Friday''s violence, most of them in police action.

But Bhatt blames the police, especially district superintendent of police (DSP) M D Antani for the violence. ""The excessive and one-sided use of force by the police led to the situation. The DSP should have restrained himself. It seems the department was overconfident,"" he said.

He added that his supporters were only temporarily angry with him. ""They are bound to say this after the police action against them. They feel that this should not have happened with our government in power,"" Bhatt said.

Antani avoided commenting on the allegations but said, ""The shops of a particular community were targeted. Anyway, our work is being watched and assessed by several people. We managed to prevent the situation from getting out of control.""

Meanwhile, curfew was imposed in another police outpost area on Saturday morning. Two shops were charred in the day, but the police claimed that stock of a mosquito repellent coil catching fore was the reason in one of the shops.

9,CM keeps mum on arrest,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu evaded questions on the issue of Pune police arresting TDP legislator C Krishna Yadav in connection with the multi-crore fake stamps racket.

â€œI am yet to get details of the case and will look into the matter later,â€� he said on Saturday. He is likely to react to the developments on Sunday after discussing the matter with senior party leaders, including home minister T Devender Goud and tourism minister T Srinivas Yadav.

According to sources, the chief minister â€” who had been away on an official trip to Guntur â€” was informed about the arrest at Begumpet airport by director-general of police (DGP) S R Sukumara, on his arrival.

He is said to have told the chief minister that the Pune police had come armed with an arrest warrant and the state police was duty bound to nab the MLA.

Meanwhile, the episode has come as a blow for the TDP, which claims to be a disciplined party and free of leaders with criminal antecedents.

According to sources, the DGP had informed the chief minister that the Maharashtra special investigating team had sufficient proof against Yadav in the scam and that even the special judge trying the case appeared satisfied with the records before issuing the arrest warrant.

TDP sources said that the chief minister was planning to wait for a couple of days to get a complete picture of the case before deciding to take the next step.

10,Sankeshwar pins hope on his party to do well,"MANGALORE: Vijay Sankeshwara, chief of Sankeshwara Pradeshika Paksha on Saturday saw brighter days ahead for his party as its foremost agenda was people''s interest and not vendetta against any party.

Speaking to reporters here, Sankeshwara, replying to a query, said other regional parties disintegrated as they were built on narcissistic ideals rather than with people in mind.

He claimed his intention to join politics was to give the full benefit of government programmes and projects to the people and not while way in corrupt practices.

Commenting on a BJP leaders statement that Sankeshwara did not know the basics of politics, he said he took it as a positive compliment. In his opinion the basics of politics were corruption and narcissism and he was glad the BJP leader had given him a compliment adversely.

He ruled out any pre poll alliance with any party in the state. Regarding post-poll alliance, he said the party will act according to the situation and there was no point in talking based on hypothetical theories.

Sankeshwara said the priority of the party was to set right the regional imbalances in the state and do full justice to all. He envisaged a membership of over 30 lakhs within a few months. The party needs about 3,000 office bearers and we are scouting for suitable candidates, he added.

Regarding another query, Sankeshwara said the majority of the party would constitute new comers. Any party hoppers are welcome, after their credentials are verfied, he said adding that they would be in a minority in the party.

Noted Kannada cine actor and director Dwarakish, who was also present, said regional parties had their own strengths pointing out at the example of Tamil Nadu. He said a national party could not be the panacea for all the ills.

He also said in his career as director, he had always chosen the right hero for his film and Sankeshwara was the right hero he had chosen in politics.

12,PU implements reservation law in toto,"PATNA: For the first time ever since the enactment of Bihar Reservation Act, 1991, Patna University has implemented the reservation law in toto in recent appointments.

The university has also implemented reservation law against single post like registrar, principal, head of post-graduate departments, director of institutes and librarian as per the Supreme Court order and subsequent government circular issued in December, 1997.

That the reservation policy has been sincerely followed in recent appointments is evident from the fact that as many as 91 out of 116 lecturers appointed in Patna University recently on the recommendation of the Bihar State University (Constituent Colleges) Service Commission belong to the reserved categories. These appointments have been made under the provision of the carried forward rules of reservation.

PU vice-chancellor K K Jha is very particular about implementation of reservation roster in all university appointments ever since he joined the office. As many as 15 office assistants belonging to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe categories were appointed by him in August last year against carried forward reservation rules. All these posts were lying vacant for the last several years. Similarly, for the first time, two assistants, namely, Rajendra Tanti and Lal Bahadur, were promoted as section officers under the reservation law.

Appreciating the vice-chancellor''s efforts to streamline university appointments as per the reservation law, PU liasion officer Shiv Jatan Thakur pointed out that no other vice-chancellor took the pains to follow the reservation rules in university appointments during the last 22 years, even though at least two vice-chancellors during this period themselves belonged to the reserved categories.

Thakur further pointed out that appointment against single posts has to be made according to roster and rotation of the reservation. Referring to Section 56(4) of Patna University Act, 1976, he said the law of reservation of the state shall be applicable in all appointments including ad-hoc ones (if made for a period of 45 days or more). That''s why, K N Paswan (belonging to SC category) has recently been appointed director the PU directorate of distance education. The same reservation law will be followed in furture appointments of heads of P-G departments of professors-in-charge of colleges, he added.

14,"Criminals arrested, weapons recovered","PATNA: Police have arrested at least half a dozen criminals, including one Bikarma, from Manpura area under the Pataliputra police station on Saturday. Bikarma is considered close to notorious criminal, Durgesh, who is at present lodged at the Beur jail.

He was operating particularly in the areas falling under the Srikrishnapuri, Buddha Colony and Pataliputra police stations,â€� said Kotwali DSP Shashi Bhushan Sharma while confirming Bikarmaâ€™s arrest. According to him, the arrested criminals were demanding extortion money from the businessmen.

15,"Mulayam inducts six ministers, 37 quit BSP","LUCKNOW: Six MLAs were sworn in as members of the Mulayam Singh Yadav Ministry here late on Saturday night. The six are Shivpal Singh Yadav and Azam Khan of the SP, Kokab Hamid and Anuradha Choudhary of the RLD and Rajvir Singh and Kusum Rai of the RKP.

This was preceded by a split in the BSP with 37 of its MLAs announcing their decision to merge with Mulayam''s SP, taking the latter''s tally to 181 from 144. The rebel BSP MLAs formed a new outfit, the Loktantrik BSP, and urged assembly Speaker Kesri Nath Tripathi to recognise the breakaway group before requesting him to allow them to merge with the SP.

Newly sworn in minister Rajvir Singh is son of RKP chief and former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh and Shivpal Singh Yadav is Mulayam''s brother. With 37 BSP MLAs pledging support to Mulayam, he is expected to sail through the vote of confidence he will seek on the floor of the assembly on September 8. The split is the highest ever in any party in the history of the state.

In the process, the BSP has suffered a major setback - its strength has come down to 72 from 109. It is likely to come down further. The party is set to lose its position of being the main opposition party in the assembly. The post of leader of opposition, being held by a BSP MLA at present, will eventually go to the BJP, which has a tally of 88. The strength of the SP - 181 after the addition of 37 BSP MLAs - is likely to touch 187, as the breakaway BSP group has claimed the support of six more MLAs.

Apart from this, Mulayam already enjoys the support of the Congress (16), RLD (14), RKP (4), two MLAs each of the CPM and the Loktantrik Congress and six of the splintered groups, besides 13 Independents. Thus, Mulayam is set to have the support of at least 238 as against the requisite number of 201 in the house of 402. One seat is vacant due to the death of a BSP MLA.

The much-awaited split in the BSP materialised after a day-long suspense. BSP rebels started gathering at the SP''s Vikramaditya Marg office from the morning. They marched from there to the chamber of Tripathi in the Council House only around 5.30 pm. Senior SP leaders, including Amar Singh, Shivpal Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Singh, MP and son of Mulayam, were present on the occasion.

Earlier, they kept delaying their meeting with the Speaker, and this led to utter confusion. The delay was said to be due to the initial reluctance on the part of some BSP rebels, which was making the strength of the breakaway group less than one third of the party''s total strength, the figure needed for a formal split. But they swung into action as soon as their number reached 37.

16,WTO ministerial meeting begins on Wednesday,"CANCUN: The fifth WTO ministerial meeting begins at Mexican beach resort Cancun on Wednesday with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan making an emotional appeal to rich countries. The appeal would be to end trade subsidies in agriculture, a topic that is going to generate heated discussions among trade ministers from 146 countries.

Indian delegation led by Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley arrives here on Monday, fully geared to counter the EU and US onslaught on developing countries by proposing to give very little on agriculture negotiations, crucial to the livelihood of 650 million Indian farmers.

Ahead of the 5-day meeting, Annan said it is the ""moral imperitive"" of developed nations to give poor countries access to cheap generic drugs and end agricultural trade subsidies.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Cancun, beginning next week, will decide whether poor countries ""will or will not, at last, be given a real chance to trade their way out of poverty,"" Annan said.

Apart from agriculture and access to cheap medicines, the contentious Singapore issues and market access in industrial products will dominate the negotiations that are expected to show sharp differences between developed and developing countries.

Speaking to reporters shortly before departure on Sunday, Jaitley said high domestic support and export subsidies in developed nations had forced developing countries to have high tariffs, which could be reduced only if developed nations go more than half way in providing market access in farm sector.

Jaitley has said India may show some flexibility on services negotiations and non agriculture products market access, but certainly not in the area of agriculture and Singapore issues.

With EU hardening its stance on phased elimination of domestic support and export subsidies in agriculture, there are apprehensions that Cancun discussions could become another fiasco a la Seattle.

For the agricultural negotiations to be meaningful, EU would have to take at least 10 steps forward for developing countries to respond, the official sources said, adding ""instead of taking five steps forward, EU is trying to take five steps backwards"".

EU, they said, was not concerned about the development dimension of the Doha work programme and was only trying to protect its subsidies as the proposal jointly mooted by it and US suited it perfectly.

India, along with China and Brazil, has already submitted a framework on agriculture with Group of 17 other nations which the Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim hoped would be approved by ministers at the meeting.

""We were able to unite all 20 countries around one single proposal, which gives more legitimacy to our concerns,"" Amorim said. ""We are optimistic this proposal can be approved.""

17,Three vendors to increase MUL's engine part supply,"NEW DELHI: India''s largest carmaker Maruti Udyog Ltd (MUL), hit by a prolonged strike at DCM Engineering, its main supplier of a vital engine component, has asked the other three suppliers to step up their production.

The three firms -- Hinduja group company Ennore Foundries, Amtek Auto, and Kirloskar Oil Engines -- have been asked to increase their production of the cylinder block of the vehicle''e engine, MUL Managing Director Jagdish Khattar told PTI.

""The strike at DCM Engineering has hit our production as it accounted for about 70 per cent of the total supplies of the cylinder block. So, we have asked the other three companies to increase their production, which they have done,"" Khattar said.

He declined to quantify the increase in production made by the three companies.

MUL''s sales in August fell by 4.2 per cent to 32,127 vehicles due to lower production following the three-month long strike at DCM Engineering.

While domestic sales slipped by 3.2 per cent to 29,443 units, exports went down by 13.2 per cent to 2,684 units.

Export of Maruti cars, specially the hatchback ''Alto'', have been increasing since the last one year.

MUL, a subsidiary of Japan''s Suzuki Motor Corporation, produces 10 passenger vehicle models at its factory at Gurgaon in Haryana.

18,BJP denies link between terror attacks and Gujarat riots,"CHANDIGARH: The Bharatiya Janta Party rejected increasing terrorist activities in the country recently, to be a fallout of the Gujarat riots, despite the involvement of some educated individuals of Indian origin.

BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar while speaking to reporters on Sunday, ruled out any link between the Gujarat riots and recent stepped up terrorist violence in J&K and rest of the country. There has been riots in Gujarat in the past, too but these never trigger terrorist violence, he added.

On the contrary, Javadekar maintained that the sudden spurt in militants'' violence indicates that our fight against the cross-border-terrorism, was at a decisive stage and the security forces were having an upper hand causing frustration in the ranks of militant outfits.

Javadekar appealed to all political parties to evolve a consensus on the decisive phase of the cross-border-terrorism and there should not be any dissenting voices on the issue of fight against militancy.

Conceding that the terrorists'' attacks have increased during the last fortnight, Javadekar claimed most of these are foiled and pre-empted because of free hand given to the security agencies, their better co-ordination and inflow of intelligence.

He said many prominent ultras have been killed, weapons and explosives have been seized in Delhi and Mumbai and many ISI and Jaish modules have been neutralised.

Javadekar maintained that this frustration resulted from their ''unsuccessful'' attempts for the last 12 years in J&K, holding of free and fair polls, turnout of over on lakh tourist this season, successful Amarnath yatra, introduction of mobile phone services, prime minister''s visit and holding of inter-state-council meet and chief ministers'' conclave held by Congress in Srinagar.

All these events have sent a strong signal to the world that J&K belongs to India and its government was in its full control, he added.

20,Stepmother held for selling minor to brothel,"MUMBAI: Sixteen-year-old Ramya (name changed) clung to one dream during the four dark years she spent in a brothel at Jamuna Mansion, Lamington Road.

She wanted to return to her village in Karnataka with the police and get her trafficker, her stepmother, arrested.

The teenagerâ€™s dream came true recently, after a six-year wait, when she returned to Shimoga village with the Mumbai police and identified her stepmother, who was later arrested.

Ramya has accused her stepmother of selling her at the age of 10 to a brothel in Jamuna Mansion for Rs 12,000. Ramya spent four years there, but was rescued by police two years ago and lodged at a rescue home in Andheri.

Recently, when members of the Child Welfare Committee met her, she gave details of her suffering in Jamuna Mansion and accused eight peopleâ€”including her stepmother, four brothel keepers and a woman police constable â€”of forcing her into prostitution.

Police have arrested three of these brothel keepers and traced the constable. One of the brothel keepers is also a woman. Hailing from Udupi, she allegedly owns several brothels in Mumbai.

Although apprehensive about returning to the village she had left six years ago, Ramya was sure that her traffickers should be punished. She left Mumbai with the police and a social worker.

â€œI remembered every thing about my village and even recognised the people there. But nobody could recognise me,â€™â€™ she told TNN.

On meeting her stepmother, Ramya confronted her, asking her whether she knew what she had put her stepdaughter through. â€œDo you know what you have done to my life?â€™â€™ she asked.

Sangita Punekar, the social worker who a c compa n i e d Ramya to the village, said that while the girl was disturbed by the process of returning to the village and getting her stepmother arrested, she did feel a sense of victory.

It was also a nostalgic moment, as she tried to catch up with details of her neighbourhood friends and their lives.

Ramyaâ€™s statement is considered significant, because it is the first time that a rescued minor girl has spoken about not only the torturous living conditions in a brothel, but also the nexus between brothel keepers and the police.

Most importantly, it throws light on how young girls are trafficked into the city.

21,"End feuding, Pawar tells ministers","MUMBAI: At a closed-door meeting on Sunday, Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar reportedly warned a gathering of his trusted aides of dire consequences if factional fighting didnâ€™t end within the party and feuds were taken to the media.

During the last state cabinet meeting, senior NCP minister Dr Padamsinh Patil and finance minister Jayant Patil, who represents Generation Next in the NCP, had clashed over the sensitive issue of funds for backward regions.

Sensing a politically explosive situation, Mr Pawar rushed to the city to meet with the select group of ministers.

While deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, at whose official residence, Ramtek, the meeting was held, and NCP state president R R Patil tried to downplay the real reason for the meeting, insiders said it was basically aimed at ironing out differences between senior ministers and other party leaders and the more aggressive group of younger ministers, including Jayant Patil, irrigation minister Ajit Pawar, energy minister Dilip Valse-Patil, and R.R. Patil, who is also rural development minister.

Dr Padamsinh Patil is upset because arguments made in the cabinet were used to blame him for not supporting the proposal to subsidise farmers in drought-prone areas.

He clarified that he was not against subsidising farmers in western Maharashtra, but was definitely opposed to diverting funds meant for drought relief to the Krishna Valley Irrigation Corporation.

Mr Ajit Pawar heads the ministry controlling the irrigation corporation. R R Patil downplayed the feuding by saying that the NCP chief gave some directives on how to deal with the drought situation, including in western Maharashtra.

Mr Bhujbal told the media after the meeting that senior leaders of the party had discussed the present student unrest in the state caused by the hike in fees for professional colleges.

22,'Public outcry must not hinder process of law',"MUMBAI: Courts in real life and reel life are two different things. Who else other than actor Salman Khan, infamous for his run-ins with the law, can best appreciate the distinction.

Last September, the police slapped a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on him following a public outcry when he rammed his Landcruiser into a Bandra bakery, allegedly in a drunken stupor, killing one and injuring four bakery workers sleeping on the pavement.

The offence, under section 304(II) of Indian Penal Code (IPC), presupposes that the accused had prior knowledge that a particular action would cause the death of a person. Last week, the Bombay high court dropped the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder,which attracts a sentence of up to ten years.

The police should not slap an offence graver than the appropriate one merely because of a public outcry, the judge noted. Normally, in such cases, the police charge the driver with rash and negligent driving, under section 304A of the IPC,which is a bailable offence punishable with maximum of two yearsâ€™ imprisonment.

Salman, who is out on bail, had moved the HC to set aside a trial court order which held him prima facie guilty of culpable homicide. The state opposed his plea strongly, but lost. Justice V M Kanade observed that the state decided to add the charge after a public interest litigation was filed on the issue.

He upheld the submissions of the actorâ€™s lawyers Shirish Gupte, Ashok Mundargi and Dipesh Mehta that even the first information report made out no case of culpable homicide.

The court accepted their plea that the initial complaint clearly stated that the actor had lost control while taking a turn and thus at best an offence of rash and negligent driving would be attracted.

The defence as well as the state had relied on several supreme court judgments to bolster their respective arguments.

The judge observed that accepting public prosecutor Purnima Kanthariaâ€™s argument that the validity of the charge should be tested only during the criminal trial would, in fact, only encourage the police to slap this charge in almost all accident cases.

â€œIt may appear that punishment prescribed for causing death under section 304A, IPC, is less stringent,but it is for the legislature to decide the term of sentence and the court should not be influenced by the sentencing pattern,â€™â€™ said the judge.

He added that in this case, Salmanâ€™s action that was without any â€œpremeditationâ€™â€™ would attract section 304A for which he should be tried. According to the judge, even the second statement of Salmanâ€™s police body guard, the complainant in the case, that he had repeatedly warned the actor to drive slowly while taking a turn as â€œanything could happenâ€™â€™ failed to make out a case of culpable homicide.

He said in the absence of ingredients pointing to culpable homicide, framing the charge â€œwould be illegal as it affects a personâ€™s liberty substantiallyâ€™â€™. The court rejected prosecutionâ€™s plea that section 304(II) was justified in the case since Salman knew the topography of the area well. The accident happened within a stoneâ€™s throw of his house.

Justice Kanade said a fine distinction must be drawn regarding knowledge that an act would result in death. He even laid down a few guidelines for the police in such cases.

For instance, the judge said culpable homicide should be applied if a driver drives at full speed into the midst of a crowd and kills someone or if a person drives on a footpath and kills pedestrians. Or a driver, who violates a no-entry sign and runs over a person.

The judge,however, directed that a magistrate should try all other charges against Salman, including those of driving without licence and driving under the influence of alcohol.

Justice V M Kanade observed that the state decided to add the charge after a PIL was filed on the issue. He upheld the submissions of the actorâ€™s lawyers that even the FIR made out no case of culpable homicide.

23,Deed writer arrested,"PANCHKULA: The police arrested a deed writer of the tehsil complex for duping a Sector 2 resident on the pretext of getting a flat by forming a cooperative house building society. Duty magistrate H S Dahiya on Sunday ordered police remand for him till September 9.

The accused, identified as Ashwani Pathak, was booked in a cheating case registered against him at the Sector 5 police station following a court direction on a complaint moved by Col R S Kaushal (retd). Kaushal was among the 125-odd members of Jan Sewa Co-operative House Building Society formed by Pathak in 1996.

It is alleged that Pathak had nominated his two employees as president and cashier of the society. Pathak allegedly collected money varying between Rs 25,000 to Rs 35,000 as part payment from members.

Police sources said Pathak had cheated a number of residents and managed to get refund by surrendering a plot allotted by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). This came to light when some of the members, including the complainant, approached HUDA to know about the fate of the plot, between 1996 and 1999.
