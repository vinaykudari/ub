0,"Cong, BJP denied me political role: Taradevi","BANGALORE: The JD(S) will be the third party-change in her political career of over two decades. But this time, former MP D.K. Taradevi Siddhartha is determined she is not given short shrift, unlike in the Congress and BJP.

Taradevi is quitting the BJP on March 27 to join former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowdaâ€™s JD(S), who has given her a few options â€” contest from Chikmagalur or Bangalore South parliamentary seats, or opt for an Assembly seat from her home district Chikmagalur, or a berth in the Rajya Sabha later.

Taradevi told The Times of India here on Thursday that she was keen to contest from Bangalore South. â€œI can put up my candidate in Chikmagalur and get him elected. It will be a two-pronged strategy to prove myself,â€™â€™ she maintained.

Seeking to set the record straight that her switching parties was not on account of being denied tickets by the Congress and BJP, she stated: â€œI was denied a political role in public life by both parties. I want to start my political career afresh. My options were limited and the choice had to be JD(S).â€™â€™

Taradevi started her political career in the Congress and came into the limelight when former PM Indira Gandhi contested from Chikmagalur. She quit the Congress and joined the BJP in 1998, when the Chikmagalur Lok Sabha ticket was given to former chief minister M. Veerappa Moily.

But she remained a strong contender for the Chikmagalur seat, with the party preferring to renominate MP D.C. Srikantappa in the dissolved House.

â€œMy access to leaders at the national level in both parties created a sense of insecurity among the state leaders. I have been marginalised through deceit and lies as they lack the grit to confront me directly,â€™â€™ Taradevi said.

She says she joined the BJP only because party leader L.K. Advani approached her and assured that her services would be utilised. â€œIt was difficult for a hardcore Congress person like me to join the BJP, for whom I was a prize catch. But the atmosphere in the BJP is such that they cannot adapt to newcomers,â€™â€™ she said.

â€œThe BJP is an outfit where all one has to do is attend meetings, when they are called, listen to speeches and go home. You are not allowed to raise issues or be involved in decision-making. It is a club, not a party,â€™â€™ Taradevi said. According to her, â€œThe Congress has degenerated. But there are still some honest people around.â€™â€™

The BJPâ€™s explanation for denying the seat, Taradevi said, was that Lingayats would turn against the party if Srikantappa was not renominated.

â€œThis is their justification. They wanted me to go and opened the doors. Now I have to make up for my seven years of political wilderness in the BJP.â€™â€™

1,Caste-based politics may have bearing on polls in Surat,"SURAT: The parliamentary polls in the diamond city are likely to acquire the traditional caste and community-based equation, especially with the Congress nominating Chandravadan Pithawala as their candidate.

With migrants as a majority in the general population and the slow transforation of the city into a cosmopolitan entity, bias for caste and community in matters related to local politics has been on decline.

In fact, election results of the past two decades have shown bearings of prevailing political waves in general. But, a low voting percentage (35.36 per cent in 1989 to 31.56 in 1999 general elections) being the hallmark of this large constituency, any caste-based equation would have its bearings on the parties in fray, say analysts.

And, with five lakh Koli Patels and four lakh people belonging to minority communities, even a slightest swing could prove decisive in terms of poll prospects of a party, they add.

In the recent times, Koli consciousness has emerged as a dominant political force after â€˜patidarsâ€™ in coastal belt of Maharatstra and Gujarat and having candidate from their own caste, would be to some extent advantage to Pithawala, said sociologist Vidyut Joshi of Centre for Social Studies.

Shortly after being nominated, Pithawala had declared that he would be getting the support of five lakh Koli voters along with the minority vote bank of about four lakh and traditionally-committed voters of the Congress.

Even in the past Koli votes had been crucial in coastal belts like Olpad, Jalalpore and Navsari in the Surat and the Congress had benefitted in the case of C D Patel, a Koli Patel himself, who won by 21,000 votes in 1980 general elections, said Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee vice-president Kadir Pirzada.

However, for the Congress it would be tough days ahead as wooing for caste-based vote banks would not be that easy in the prevailing situation, remarked oppostion leader in SMC Babu Raika. But, concerted efforts by highlighting the failures of the sitting MP Kashiram Rana would definitely help the Congress to garner a large support base, he added.

Pithawala, who admitted that he was yet to gear up for the electoral battle said that he would be highlighting issues affecting the diamond city. Among other things, he blamed the BJP for ignoring a commercial hub like Surat. A city which generates so much of revenue is yet to have an airport, educational institutions of repute, hospitals with latest facilities and many other things, he says.

Local BJP leaders are of the view that with Pithawala as the Congress candidate, BJP will retain the seat for the sixth time in a row, but party insiders admitted that the margin of win may not be that wide this time.

Pithawala, who is being projected as Congress president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s choice for the Surat seat, is being helped by the factions in the party at local level, said sources in the party.

2,SP rakes up issue of including Hardwar in UP,"HARDWAR: The Samajwadi Party leaders are once again bringing up the long-forgotten issue of including Hardwar in Uttar Pradesh to woo voters in the Lok Sabha polls.

SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav recently addressed a huge public meeting in Roorkee in Hardwar district of Uttaranchal and announced his partyâ€™s resolve to separate Hardwar and Udham Singh Nagar from Uttaranchal and include them in UP.

The party feels that these areas of Uttaranchal are neglected and development is taking place only in the hill districts. Though the party leaders claim that residents of Hardwar are with them on this issue, this has been proved wrong time and again during the assembly and panchayat polls in the state.

The party has been asserting that even if its candidates are defeated in the Lok Sabha elections, it would not give up this movement of separating these plain areas of Uttaranchal and including them in UP.

Meanwhile, the Congress, BJP and BSP are fiercely opposed to any such move and consider Hardwar an integral part of the â€˜Devbhumiâ€™ of Uttarakhand. These parties describe the SPâ€™s stand on this issue as ""antipeople"". According to BJPâ€™s senior spokesperson Devendra Bhasin, this was a ""cheap"" way for the SP to make its presence felt as it had completely lost ground in the hill state. Congress spokesperson Surendra Kumar said that any such move would be ""a contempt of Parliament"".

3,Foolproof arrangement for polls,"GORAKHPUR: The police have made fool-proof arrangements to hold free and fair XIV th Lok Sabha elections in UP. None of the anti-social elements would evade police vigilance, according to the DGP VK Nair.

After reviewing the law and order situation here, Nair told the media here on Wednesday that sensitive police stations and polling centres have been identified. The Indo-Nepal and UP-Bihar border would be sealed on the day of polling and special vigil would be maintained over on the activities of Maoists, ISI agents and the criminals. Special vigil would also be mounted on candidates who have criminal backgrounds. About 136 barriers would be installed in the zone to seal the border, 37 check posts would be set up at Indo-Nepal border and 48 check posts on UP- Bihar border to check the infiltration of anti-social elements on the day of polling.

Election Commission also agreed to hold polls in eastern UP and adjacent areas of Bihar on the same day, he said.

About 148 companies of the PAC, One lakh home guards, 35,000 PVD guards and forest guards along with 25 company of Central police organisations have been requisitioned. The DGP said that he had information from intelligence sources that some people residing on the Indo-Nepal border had established contacts with the Maoists.

4,Only India's elections shine,"NEW DELHI: Counting working democracies east of the Bosphurus needs a toddlerâ€™s math skills. The few working examples are Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan, but the bustle of democracy there pales in comparison to the great Indian political bazaar.

The Philippines and Indonesia, emerging from dictatorship, are yet to stabilise their elections. Each is fraught with violence and allegations of misdeeds. Voting actually works in places like Taiwan and Malaysia, but here democracy is still nascent. Indians may crib about the kind of leadership that elections throw up but thereâ€™s no serious doubt that the electoral process actually works.

This week, as the campaign in India shifts to higher gear, two other countries, Taiwan and Malaysia, just completed elections. These didnâ€™t change regimes, but raised questions about which way these democracies were headed. Consider Taiwan, where like Indiaâ€™s Atal Bihari Vajpayee, President Chen Shui-bian fought to retain his incumbency. The verdict in the direct presidential vote returned him to office but left the fledgling democracy in a huge crisis. Chen barely won Saturdayâ€™s vote by a hairâ€™s breadth, 0.2%, provoking rival Kuomingtan Party to allege fraud. They also alleged that an unexplained election-eve shooting of Chen that lightly wounded the president, was staged. Protests have rocked Taipei for five straight days. The election could be nullified. Taiwanâ€™s elections have always had the spectre of communist China looming over them. Relations with China are a major issue: Beijing resents Chenâ€™s threat to move Taiwan towards full independence.

Malaysia held its general election Sunday. The ruling National Front won 90% seats in the 219-seat Parliament. Malaysia is a democratic oxymoronâ€”a virtual one-party system. A tiny resource-rich nation of about 22 million people, it has been a one-leader state for more than two decades under Mahathir Mohammadâ€™s velvet-gloved authoritarianism. Any sign of opposition, either from within Mahathirâ€™s United Malay Nationalist Organisation, from religious or socialist groups, was crushed and leaders jailed. Case in point: Anwar Ibrahim, once Mahathirâ€™s anointed successor, now serving a 14-year sentence in jail. Abdullah Ahmed Badawi, who succeeded Mahathir, called a snap poll to legitimise his office and crushed the only semblance of opposition from the Islamist party. That leaves the ruling coalition between the UMNO, which mopped up all the votes of the dominant Malay Muslim community, and the party that represents the countryâ€™s nearly 30% wealthy Chinese minority.

These nations make a poor contrast to India, where democracy is stable and empowerment is not a sham. Mechanical and legalistic democracies abound, but nowhere in Asia is the democratic spirit as strong.

5,Water riots: 35 areas identified,"NEW DELHI: The city is witnessing the hottest March since 1985. The mercury which crossed 39Â°C on March 22 is still hovering round an uncomfortable 35Â°C. Even the minimum temperature is five degrees above normal. Alarm bells are ringing, and, loudly at that.

With water and power situation worsening by the day and Lok Sabha elections round the corner, it isnâ€™t a surprise. Stepping up its preparedness for the aftereffects of acute water shortage, the Delhi Police have identified over 35 potential â€˜â€˜trouble areas.â€™â€™

These flash-points include up-market areas like Defence Colony, Vasant Kunj, Greater Kailash II, Mehrauli and middle-class localities like Patel Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Dwarka, Kalkaji, Tilak Nagar, Vikaspuri and Shahpur Jat.

Lower-income-group localities like Sangam Vihar, Narela, Najafgarh, Sadiq Nagar, Uttam Nagar and Dabri also feature in the list.

A letter comprising the list and other observations has already been sent to all â€˜â€˜concernedâ€™â€™ departments of the police and the Delhi government for necessary action.

According to a senior DJB official, the city is already facing over 30% shortage of filtered water. About 25 to 30% of the filtered water being made available is â€˜â€˜wastedâ€™â€™ through corroded pipelines and non-judicious use by residents.

To diffuse any potential situation the local police has been asked to liaise with the RWAs. â€˜â€˜We are acting as a link between residents and the DJB to mitigate the effects of water shortage. We act as a facilitator by providing helpline numbers from where residents can call for tankers. Both sides thankfully cooperate,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (southwest), Tajinder Luthra.

District control rooms of the â€˜â€˜troubled areasâ€™â€™ too have been alerted to watch out for signs of trouble. South district, which has the maximum number of â€˜â€˜trouble spotsâ€™â€™ stepped up beat patrolling in the identified areas. â€˜â€˜We especially watch out for trouble in lower-income group colonies where the patience fuse is shorter. In case of tension brewing anywhere we contact DJB officials for additional water supply,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (south), Vivek Gogia.

â€˜â€˜NDMC that covers only about 2 % of the city gets 30% of the water supply. Itâ€™s very unfair distribution. A little water can be diverted to ease the situation,â€™â€™ commented a senior police officer.

6,'Coming from a political family helps',"NEW DELHI: As he walks in for a tete-a-tete over coffee, sporting a T-shirt, a pair of track pants and sneakers, he surely looks the most unlikely candidate, if thatâ€™s the way things go for the Congress. When he pulls up the chair and you notice the ear studs, you wonder if he is sure about plunging thick into politics. But as you catch up with him in conversation, the picture gets clearer. He is not as casual about the idea of contesting from the East Delhi seat as it appears.

Thatâ€™s Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshitâ€™s son Sandeep, who is believed to be a favourite for the east Delhi seat, since 15 of the 16 Congress MLAs from the constituency have signed a letter to party president Sonia Gandhi backing him as the consensus candidate from the area. After all, a UP Brahmin is not a bad candidate to field from East Delhi, they say.

If Rahul Gandhi can inherit his family business, whatâ€™s wrong with Shiela Dikshitâ€™s son and the grandson of Uma Shankar Dikshit, they ask.

A Modern School (Barakhamba Road) product, 39-year-old Sandeep Dikshit, graduated from the Institute of Rural Management, Anand, and has been running his own Bhopal-based NGO Sanket.

â€œThat is how I started working with state governments in the development sector and realised that whether in developed states like Punjab or in underdeveloped states like Madhya Pradesh, there is still a lot that needs to be done. For that, governments need to be sensitive about the issues.

â€œHaving seen Digvijay Singh functioning in MP, I realised a lot can be achieved if one gets a platform. And that is what probably prompted me into taking the plunge,â€™â€™ says a candid social worker, who would like to play his part in real politics now.

So it wasnâ€™t a sudden decision, after all? â€œNot really. I have been seriously thinking about it for the last three years. For the last six months I have been here and politically active. We worked real hard for Gole Market, and my decision was taken right after that,â€™â€™ says Sandeep.

Why east Delhi? â€œI was campaign manager in 1998 for my mother when she stood from there. She lost, but I got to the know people there real well and developed a very close relationship with them. They kept calling me for social and political work since I had access to the chief minister,â€™â€™ he explains.

The Delhi chief ministerâ€™s son, a political nobody so far, hoping for a prized Delhi ticket... what about being accused of encouraging dynastic rule?

â€œI know I have to face this question. And itâ€™s a fair question to raise. I agree that coming from a political family helps. It gives you an easy entry, because those who matter in the party know you and about you.

â€œBut at another level, it doesnâ€™t help. One has to fend for oneself beyond that. From my end, itâ€™s crossing the defined line, not coming from a different field, says Sandeep. TNN

8,Khandayats moving into political gear in Orissa,"NEW DELHI: Orissa is one of the few states where politics is still immune to the caste influence. Political battles are fought mostly over personalities, not caste lines.

Contenders for power are often from the same community. A long stretch of the stateâ€™s post-Independence history has seen titanic clashes between the Patnaiks â€” first Biju vs JB, then Naveen vs JB.

But all that may be over if some politicians succeed in forging the Khandayats, the single largest caste, into a political community. Former Union minister and Congress leader Srikant Jena and a few other Khandayat politicians have sought to tinker with the stateâ€™s caste equilibrium by claiming the community has not been able to convert its numerical strength into political power.

While there is some truth in their claim, the fact remains that the Khandayats, an upwardly mobile agricultural community, constituting over 35% of the stateâ€™s population, have produced several charismatic leaders.

Harekrushna Mehtab, Orissaâ€™s first CM, belonged to this caste. An astute leader with a long tenure as CM, Mehtab began the trend of marrying the media to politics by launching a newspaper.

Nilmani Raut Ray was another CM from the community. Present-day Khandayats in politics, apart from Jena, are Congress leader K C Lenka, BJP state president Manmohan Samal and R P Swain, a minister. In the just dissolved 13th Lok Sabha, 6 of Orissaâ€™s 21 MPs were Khandayats.

Concentrated in the coastal districts wih some pockets in central Orissa, the traditional agricultural community has moved up with its forays into professions by taking advantage of the educational opportunities after Independence.

Their numerical advantage notwithstanding, the Khandayats are nowhere near the Patnaiks in the power race, despite the fact that the latter make for a mere 5% of the state population. Though caste has never been an important factor in Orissa politics, politicians like Jena have tried to carve out some space to build a Khandayat vote-bank.

The BJP has sought to subsume the social cleavages by Hindutva. It will be interesting to see if Jena and Swain can sway fellow Khandayats to create a new electoral enclave for themselves. TNN

9,Because politics is for you and me,"PUNE: One either likes or hates this man. But even Arun Bhatiaâ€™s worst enemy will vouch for one thing: his unblemished character and clean image.

An alumni of St Stephens, Delhi and Cambridge University, Bhatia had a knack for stirring a hornetâ€™s nest wherever he was posted in his IAS career spanning 35 years.

No wonder he was transferred 26 times. But this did not deter him from exposing corrupt politicians. During his last posting as commissioner, tribal research, Bhatia enraged the state government by exposing acute malnutrition in tribal areas.

The lists of scams he has exposed is long but a few sensational examples need mention. As commissioner food and drug administration he exposed recycling of outdated drugs involving multinational drug company Glaxo. As district collector, Dhule he exposed corruption in the employment guarantee scheme. As collector Mumbai he brought to light the FSI scam in government residential quarters, while as Pune municipal commissioner he demolished illegal constructions and challenged the legality of a parking lot owned by MP Suresh Kalmadiâ€™s family.

Even in his new role as wannabe MP, Bhatia is different. Pamphlets are being distributed explaining why he is contesting and why he has not joined any party, though the third front did want him. â€œI started campaigning in November and by December I got a response from people. I am targeting slum dwellers, the non-voting upper middle class, middle class and senior citizens,â€� he says.

Vinod Bodhankar, Bhatiaâ€™s press manager, explains just how different Bhatiaâ€™s campaign is. â€œWe want to follow the Janaagraha peopleâ€™s movement in Bangalore which is overtly supported by Infosys bosses Nandan Nilekani and Narayanmurthy. They have succeeded in capturing budgets in 10 municipal wards where people control and monitor the spending. We want to achieve this in Pune,â€� he said.

The Rs 820 crore Pune municipal corporation budget, spending on frivolilties like swimming pools and lack of accountability in the PMC are Bhatiaâ€™s pet topics. He wants to make the PMC budget citizen-controlled. â€˜Capture Pune budgetâ€™ is his motto.

â€œI want to demonstrate that good people should not distance themselves from mainstream politics and ordinary people can contest and win elections,â€� he said adding that merely being good was not enough and that one must have a track record of fighting corruption. TNN

11,"HC stops Sena, BJP rally","MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court on Friday stopped the Shiv Sena and the BJP from holding a political rally at Girgaum Chowpatty on Sunday.

Justice A P Shah and Shiavax Vazifdar refused permission for the event, upholding the March 20 decision of the committee appointed by the court to monitor the beautification of the beach. The committee is headed by senior counsel Rafiq Dada and includes former culture minister Pramod Navalkar, architect Rahul Mehrotra, additional municipal commissioner Subrat Ratho, counsel Navroz Seervai as well as the city collector. BJP MLA Atul Shah had sought the committeeâ€™s sanction with a strong recommendation letter from former Sena minister Navalkar.

However, the collectorâ€™s office moved the high court, seeking permission for the rally on the grounds that Chowpatty has been a traditional venue for such events. Refusing permission, according to the collector, may create a law and order problem. Government lawyer Niranjan Pandit said the court could permit all political parties to hold their rallies at Chowpatty till such time guidelines were framed.

However, Seervai, defended the committeeâ€™s decision and pointed out that since its inception in 2001, the committee had consistently refused permission to such programmes either by political parties or social organisations.

He said even the December 27-28, 2003 meeting of the Congress party, which was to be presided by its president Sonia Gandhi and chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde, was refused permission.

He said a masterplan for the beach prepared by the committee has recommended the ban of all political meetings and morchas at the seafront.

The judges, who were initially inclined to permit the rally, later found that the committeeâ€™s decision was reasonable.

12,Show opinion polls the exit: EC,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission feels that exit and opinion polls can be banned. It pins a lot of hope on the all-party meeting scheduled for April 6 to discuss the issue.

Apart from the political consensus in favour of a ban the EC witnessed during the previous all-party meeting on February 20, it is also counting on another factor that legal experts have pointed out. A senior EC official says the apex court had only asked if EC could enforce the ban.

â€˜â€˜Our ban order was not quashed in the strict sense but we decided to withdraw the order,â€™â€™ he says. In a nutshell, he feels, the problem is of evolving a mechanism which could satisfy the SC.

But sources feel that the ban might not be possible during this electi on and the current move is only for future elections.

The Commission is of firm belief that there should be no exit and opinion poll in a multi-phase election. In 1999, EC sources feel, exit polls did influence voting after the first phase.

Therefore, a way out in evolving a mechanism could emerge at the meeting. Once the EC and the political parties agree on how and who would enforce the ban, the SC would be approached with a review petition. Either the information and broadcasting ministry or a political party would be made a petitioner to which the EC would be a party.
