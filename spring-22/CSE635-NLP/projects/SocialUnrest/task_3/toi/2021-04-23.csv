0,"No child's play this, but govt looks away","JAIPUR: Resplendent in a red turban, a plume and a crest adorning it, the groom sits on a pedestal in a Rajasthani home on the Jaipur-Ajmer road on Thursday.

Weddings such as these are most auspicious when they fall on Aakha Teej or Akshaya Tritiya. Except that in this case it''s completely illegal because the baby-faced groom looks barely 15.

Despite the weight of the law and the probing eyes of social reformers, child marriages took place in secret throughout Rajasthan and western Madhya Pradesh away from the glare, pomp and paegeantry of the thousands of other Hindu weddings, including Virendra Sehwag''s in Delhi.

In Bangalore, women dragged their husbands out to jewellry stores which stayed open past normal shopping hours. â€œMy wedding is in June, but I am buying all my gold today and I hope gold will keep coming to me all year, â€œ said Divya Govind, who, like many others in south India believes it is an auspicious day to buy gold.

Several hundred child marriages were performed throughout Rajasthan. With Lok Sabha elections due on May 5 the state administration did little that could provoke the community''s anger.

Like previous years, there were no arrest of parents involved in organising these events that appeared to enjoy the blessing of the local Rajasthani villagers.

Aware of legal repurcussions, villagers kept away not only social activists but also reporters and photographers. As far as the state was concerned, there wasn''t much worry because the only thing it did was to have the women and child department conduct a ritual awareness campaign against child marriage.

According to reports, over half a dozen child marriages were performed in Jhalrapatan area of Jhalawar, which is the constituency of chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Most children who were married off were in the 10-15 age group.

In one village on the Jaipur-Kota highway, three minor girls were married off.

1,Review transfer policy: IRS men,"NEW DELHI: Indian Revenue Service officers in cushy metro postings who may be transferred out of the top nine revenue generating metros because of a new policy have appealed for a review.

Besides laying down that no freshly inducted officer can be posted in the metros, the new policy, to be implemented after the polls, says an officer of the rank of assisstant commissioner and above can''t be in a metro for longer than six years.

Moreover, an officer can be on deputation only after nine years; when counting period of continuous stay in a station, only the period spent on the first deputation will be excluded and subsequent deputation will be counted as continuous stay.

Shaken by the new guidelines, IRS officers have appealed to the CBDT requesting a review by the finance ministry. The officers also say the policy will cause problems â€” the tenures slotted for cities of different categories will not add up to fill the vacancies that routine transfers will throw up.

Moreover their children''s education will be affected, officers say.

4,All decode exit polls differently,"CHANDIGARH: Whatever the impact of the opinion and exit polls on the outcome of the Lok Sabha elections on the national level, but parties in fray for the Chandigarh constituency strongly feel it will influence the poll results here.

When it comes to the desirability of making known to the masses the results of opinion and exit polls before actual polling takes place, all the candidates reacted on expected lines.

While the country debates the need to ban these polls, TNN spoke to the candidates and their spokespersons on the subject.

BJP''s Satya Pal Jain says the impact of the opinion and exit polls that indicated the return of the NDA to power will have a positive impact on the prospects of the BJP in Chandigarh.

He pointed out that in all the previous LS elections, the winner from the lone UT seat had always been from the ruling party at the Centre, except in 1999 when the Congress won the seat despite the NDA forming a government.

He said the exit and opinion polls reflected the mood of the nation which would be reflected in the Chandigarh LS poll results also.

Though the opinion and exit polls were not always correct in predicting the polls results, they generally indicated the choice of the people.

Jain criticised the Congress for using the opinion poll to their advantage when a Congress victory was predicted in Punjab. Now they are making a noise over the exit polls predicting the NDA''s victory.

Congress'' Pawan Kumar Bansal questioned the authenticity of the polls and said that they were not always accurate. But he did not waste time before saying that the trend was in favour of the Congress and that the Congress would win ultimately.

He claimed that the hype about the ''India Shining'' campaign of the NDA had waned and people were realising that the Vajpayee government had done nothing for the country in the last five years.

What impact would the exit polls have in Chandigarh? Bansal said that voters of the city were educated and they would make a choice on the basis of performance and not on the basis of misinformation. He was sure the voters would elect him from the lone UT seat.

Though INLD''s Harmohan Dhawan was busy campaigning and unavailable for comments, his spokesperson Sandeep Singh said the exit polls had indicated that regional parties were doing well. The impact of the exit poll would be in Dhawan''s favour, he said. He wondered how the Congress was wary of the exit polls, when it used the same in its favour in the assembly election.

Whether such polls were necessary, Jain said there was no harm in having them published or telecast. But Congress was against making the results of exit polls known before the election was over.

In case of INLD, Sandeep Singh said a decision on the ban could be taken after the LS polls were over. Nevertheless, a decision needed to be taken immediately, he added.

5,Small expenses heavy on party kitty,"KOLKATA: Hiring pigeons for three hours. Painting them in the party colour. Buying a few kilos of flowers, hiring drummers and trucks, buying cold drinks and daabs, getting booklets printed and caps stitched with the party symbol.

The account books of poll managers in the city make for interesting reading. What''s more interesting is the figures beside each item and the rounded-off total at the bottom. You never thought a few caps or some pigeons would cost a mountain.

Most parties admit that these apparently ""insignificant purchases"" are burning a hole in their pockets, forcing them to start ""urgent"" fund raising drives, not all of them overboard.

For example, BJP is taxing transporters and lorries Rs 10 each on the highway in Nadia. CPM has all but legalised the act, handing out printed bills for ""donations"" from households.

""We have little option because there is an acute shortage of funds. We are not as cash rich as CPM which is collecting money from even the industries to meet poll expenses,"" said BJP Nadia district president Pramod Ghosh.

Poll managers never had a tougher job. They have to decide whether to hold a padayatra or a car rally. ""A car rally costs about Rs 5,000. A padayatra costs much more because the cars have to follow at a very slow pace. So we organise walks only where it is essential,"" said a poll manager.

With the face of elections changing, and glow-signs, vinyl printing, billboards, electronic displays and computer database replacing old time posters, banners and hoardings, the cost has escalated manifold.

""It is very difficult to meet such expenses,"" said Kolkata North East Trinamul candidate Ajit Panja.

A single vinyl printing costs Rs 10,000, and hiring a billboard comes for no less than Rs 8,000. Summer campaigning has its own burden.

""Due to the heat, leaders prefer to campaign after dusk, which requires lights. Then, banners have to illuminated by halogen lights. Expenses are many,"" said a CPM poll manager.

""It is good that there are well-wishers for the party who share part of the expense,"" claimed CPM candidate in Kolkata North West, Sudhangshu Sil.

These ""well-wishers"" are named innocuously, in small print, in the daily expense list, which has been made mandatory by the Election Commission.

""If there are no names, the expenses are seen to be borne by the candidate,"" said an election department official.

6,Opp prepares to stem CPM 'poll violence',"KOLKATA: Allegations of pollviolence against CPM have already started surfacing. The three main opposition parties - BJP, Trinamul Congress and the Congress - have joined forces to stem the Left''s alleged attempts to ""disrupt the poll process"".

Trinamul has prepared a list of constituencies where it apprehends trouble. ""Violence has started and it will get worse in the days to come. The CPM is out to rig the elections,"" said leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjee.

Acting PCC president Pradip Bhattacharya feared violence would be on the ""same scale as the panchayat polls"".

The Trinamul and BJP have written to the Chief Election Commissioner complaining about the ""obstructions"" faced by their candidates during campaigning.

After Jadavpur candidate Krishna Bose, Trinamul has alleged that its Panskura candidate Hema Chowbey has also been heckled by CPM goons.

BJP is complaining about Goghat and Khanakul assembly segments in Arambagh constituency. ""Our candidates are not being allowed to campaign. We hope the CEC will take steps,"" said state BJP president Tathagata Roy.

CPM has rubbished the allegations. ""The Opposition is not in a position to even man the polling booths. That is why they are making such wild allegations,"" said CPM state secretary Anil Biswas.

7,Cooch Behar FB embroiled in party feud,"JALPAIGURI: The charisma of Amar Roy Pradhan has dwarfed the official Forward Bloc candidate, Hiten Burman, in Cooch Behar.

Roy Pradhan, the Subhashbadi Forward Bloc candidate, won on Forward Bloc ticket in last parliamentary polls. While many veteran Forward Bloc leaders still want him as the party candidate, Cooch Behar strongman and state agriculture minister Kamal Guha is supporting Hiten Barman.

According to Subhashbadi Forward Bloc leader Bimal Basu, the FB had decided to give ticket to Barman in violation of party norms, succumbing to Guha''s demand.

Basu, the former district president of the FB, left the party following an internal feud. And a large section of CPM supporters are supporting Roy Pradhan. Last week, the SFI had organised a rally in Dinhata to ex-press support to the former FB leader.

Bloc veterans fear that a triangular contest in this constituency between the Congress, the Forward Bloc and the Subhasbadi Forward Bloc might prove disastrous for the Left.

""It happened in 1971 when Congress took Coochbehar by defeating both FB and CPM. This might happen again though the Bloc has lost most its organisational strongholds to CPM in this area, said Subhasbadi FB secretary Haripada Mandal.

8,Krishna's e-topia not shining for farmers,"BANIKOPPA: When this desolate, arid village in Haveri district, northern Karnataka, goes to the polls on Monday, one young man will not be around to cast his vote.

On April 17, Basavaraj Shankarappa Konanavara, a 26-year-old farmer neck deep in debt, locked himself inside the pumpset room on the two acres of fallow land that were his and hanged himself.

In the Shining India of Vajpayee and the e-utopia of S. M. Krishna, the death of Basavaraj is a rude, unwelcome intrusion nobody really wants to talk about.

Four years ago, he had borrowed Rs 50,000 from a local bank for a borewell. Confident the pump would help irrigate his fields, he borrowed another Rs 20,000 to buy a motorcycle.

But the borewell soon dried up and so did his fields. With no income, his dues quickly mounted to over one lakh.

""We knew he was under pressure because creditors came calling every 15-20 days,"" Basavaraj''s father, Shankarappa said. ""But he never said anything. Even when his motorcycle was repossessed, he didn''t show any emotion.""

Like other parts of the Hubli-Dharwar region, Banikoppa has been in the grip of a severe drought for the past few years. Thirty farmers have killed themselves in the past year in Haveri district alone; the tally across Karnataka is close to 700.

""We have had no crop at all for three years,"" said Shankarappa, who, in better days, grew chillies, groundnut, jowar and cotton on his six acres. ""Now we are borrowing from here and there just to live.""

The day after his son died, every political party, including Congress and BJP, came by to condole and promise help.

""Wait till the elections are over and we form the government,"" they told him. But Shankarappa is a proud and bitter man. ""I don''t wan''t their help,"" he says contemptuously. ""I have no faith in governments.""

What is strange in the election campaigns here is the near-absence of farmers'' suicides as an issue. That Congress state government would prefer silence is understandable but even BJP has not sought to talk about it.

""Nobody has really highlighted this issue,"" says Shivram Pailoor, a Dharwar-based farmers'' rights campaigner. ""BJP has mentioned it, but it has avoided addressing it terms of finding a solution.""

The main plank of BJP in both the Lok Sabha constituencies here, Dharwar South and Dharwar North, is the Atal factor and the promise of development.

Thanks to JD(U), which polled 41% of the vote in Dharwar South in 1999, BJP has managed to make significant inroads here.

And even though the party is not making a big issue of the Krishna government''s inept handling of the drought or the farmers'' suicides, a definite chunk of the rural population looks set to vote BJP.

In Kuppalur village, a year after Hanumappa Manamanavar killed himself by taking poison because he could not repay Rs 30,000 and feared his 7 acres would be taken away, his widow, Karabasavva, is still waiting for relief.

""The officials told me, ''The rules have now changed. Had your husband killed himself a little earlier, you would have got compensation''.""

Though the government is refusing to treat Hanumappa''s death as a ''genuine'' case, local BJP leaders have promised they will get Karabasavva compensation. ""We will vote for BJP and see if they help us,"" said one young man.

He said they were dependent on drought relief work for survival. Villagers also said the below-poverty-line ration cards in the area had all been cornered by the well-off.

9,Cong to act against erring partymen,"PATNA: The state Congress on Wednesday appealed to its district presidents to report any incident of anti-party activity on the part of party workers to the BPCC.

They have been asked to ensure active participation of party workers in favour of the Congress candidates.

BPCC president Ram Jatan Sinha has also appealed to district party presidents not to suspend party workers found indulging in anti-party activities, as it would go against the party constitution.

After the Lok Sabha elections such reports would be placed before the state disciplinary committee and in the light of its recommendations necessary and proper action would be taken.

The district committees and AICC would be informed about the actions taken against them, he added.

Meanwhile, a number of youth Congress and NSUI leaders, in a joint press statement on Wednesday, claimed that in the current Lok Sabha election it is certain that the NDA would be wiped out not only from Bihar but also from the entire country.

Signatories to the statement included state Youth Congress president Jai Prakash Chaudhary, vice-presidents Hasib Anwar and Ranjit Yadav, general secretary Siddharth Kshatriya, NSUI president Rashid Fakri.

BPCC vice-president Shakilujjama Ansari also claimed that in the first phase of Lok Sabha election held in 11 of the 40 constituencies of the state the secular front of the Congress has established a lead over NDA, since the front had the support of masses.

He predicted that Congress candidates Meira Kumar from Sasaram and Nikhil Kumar from Aurangabad would win the election with a heavy margin.

Commenting on exit poll conducted by different agencies, he said that agencies were not unanimous in their findings and hence the exit poll forecasts are not correct. Even in the past forecasts of such exit polls were proved to be incorrect, he added.

BPCC has also criticised defence minister George Fernandes for his reported statement that the Congress has accepted its defeat prior to the Lok Sabha poll.

State spokesman Azami Bari said that Fernandes is recognised for giving false, baseless and concocted statements. He should have given statement keeping the prestige and honour of his post, he stated.
