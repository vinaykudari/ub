3,Follow apex court guidelines on bandh: High Court,"mumbai: mumbai high court has directed the centre, maharashtra government and police to strictly comply with a supreme court order which had declared bandh as illegal act and fixed responsibility for payment of compensation on the state in case of damage to properties during disturbances. the order was delivered by chief justice b p singh and justice vijaya kapse-tahilramani who last week disposed of a public interest litigation (pil) which challenged holding of bandh by political parties and organisations. the judges were of the view that the apex court had already examined the legal aspect of the issue and held that the bandh was illegal and unconstitutional. therefore, there was no need to look into this matter once again, they felt. the pil was filed by former director general of police julio ribeiro and social activists gerson d'cunha, b g deshmukh and alyque padamsee. the pil based its argument on a judgment of a full bench of kerala high court which had been upheld by the apex court. the kerala high court had held that organising bandh by any association or political party was unconstitutional and illegal and had directed the state to compensate the resultant loss suffered due to damage to public and private properties. according to petitioners, indian merchant chambers had estimated that a bandh cost the city's economy rs 500 crore. apart from the loss which a bandh causes, inhabitants of the city were deprived of their fundamental right to move freely.

4,MSU student leaders give 'total bandh'call,"vadodara: ms university student leaders have called a 'total bandh' to protest against the decision to introduce payment seat scheme in commerce faculty. the decision to call for a university bandh was taken on thursday by msu students union on wednesday after vice-chancellor anil kane refused to meet union leaders. upset over kane's attitude, student leaders declared that a 'bandh' was the only option left to protest against the 'unilateral and dictatorial' decision to bring a section of admissions in bcom under self-financed category. the msu syndicate had unanimously passed the proposal to give admissions in bcom to 4770 students in the normal course and charge rs 6000 as term fees from the remaining students. the msu had converted the entire syndicate into a committee to administer commerce admissions. ""they have not considered the view of students. they are 20-odd administer and we represent some 35,000 students of this university. and not a single student on msu campus is in favour of this payment seats decision "", union general secretary bharat dangar said. the union has called a meeting of all its members on friday. union leaders also suspected that the decision to introduce payment seats in commerce has been deliberately taken. ""some syndicate members of msu have business interest. they are partners in four colleges of commerce that have been given no-objection certificate by the msu. if msu charges 6000 per term fees from students they would be discouraged to join the commerce faculty. however, the private colleges will keep there fees a few hundreds less than commerce faculty fees and thus plan to get students"", dangar pointed. he said that some syndicate members have been openly lobbying for private commerce colleges. ""this scheme of plan serves their business interest. they want to make money out of this and this is at the cost of students of vadodara"", dangar alleged. the msusu however has resolved that their bandh would be peaceful. ""we would not resort to violence. we would walk into the class rooms, explain to students why we are protesting and ask them to join us. we are confident that unlike kane and the syndicate members students of this university are not insensitive"", dangar said

7,VMC corporators up in arms against state govt,"vijayawada: opposition parties in the vijayawada municipal corporation (vmc) are up in arms against the state government over what they call undermining the sanctity of the civic body and trying to sidestep the elected council. minister for agriculture vadde sobhanadreeswara rao is also being accused of interfering in civic body affairs on various issues even as a controversy is raging over the proposed shifting of residents of the 17th division to rajarajeswaripet. it is the second time in last one month that vadde is being accused of trying to influence the vmc by interfering in its functioning. it all started with the council adopting a resolution at its last meeting for relocating the 400-odd families residing along the bandar canal bund at rajarajeswaripet. these families had encroached the canal bund and built houses several years ago. with the construction of the pandit nehru bus station and the subsequent growth of traffic, the problems compounded because of this illegal habitation. in 1996-97 last, the vmc decided to relocate these families at ajit singh nagar, but that move somehow had to be aborted. since the traffic problems were mounting, the vmc and the police found it fit to relocate the residents at least now. meanwhile, a td leader constructed a hotel on the canal bund after reportedly obtaining permission from the irrigation department for raising a nursery. the vmc sought to dismantle the hotel, but the td leader obtained a stay from the high court. against this backdrop, the vmc general body adopted a resolution on june 28 for relocation of the families at rajarajeswaripet. the td, which opposed the resolution in the council despite being a minority, chose the backdoor route to stop the relocation. minister for municipal administration n md farook directed his principal secretary to issue a stay order on the relocation. the congress, the cpi and the cpm cried foul over this and alleged that the stay was granted only to prevent dismantling of the hotel. a senior congress corporator told the times of india that it was at the behest of vadde sobhanadreeswara rao that the stay order was granted. in fact, the opposition parties allege that the minister had been trying to influence the decisions of the vmc on different issues with the help of the mayor. earlier, he wrote a letter to the vmc asking it to allocate shops in the newly-constructed kaleswara rao general market complex without collection of goodwill amount (non-refundable deposit). ""vadde has no business to interfere with the civic affairs,"" former chairman of standing committee samanthapudi narsaraju said. vijayawada west mla jaleel khan alleged that the state government, which was promising more powers to the local bodies, was in fact trying to supercede the council and impose its decisions. ""this is totally illegal,"" he pointed out. the opposition parties are planning to take up the issue once again in the next council meeting and also bring pressure on the government to withdraw the controversial stay order.

8,Govt's MBC escapades only an election stunt: Sathi,"lucknow: ""will the bjp ensure that the head priest of the proposed ram temple be an mbc or an extreme dalit or will the post continue to be reserved for an upper caste? why is the congress suddenly going gaga over my report. it had full 10 years at its disposal to implement the same. the truth is that it is neither the bjp nor the congress or even the sp or bsp which have a genuine concern for these castes. they are all using them for their vested interests."" for octogenarian dr chhedi lal sathi the wheel has come a full circle. having scripted the sathi most backward classes commission report in the seventies (and also seen it thrown in the lumber room), he now finds political parties of all hues waxing eloquent on the need to better the lot of this section of society. but sathi knows that nothing will come out of these efforts. ""chunavi hathkhnade hai"" (they are election stunts), he says wryly. and not without reason. it was in october 1975 that then uttar pradesh chief minister hn bahuguna requisitioned the services of dr sathi for compiling a report on the mbcs with its main thrust on how to improve their economic status. ""all communities of the bcs are caste based who have been following their traditional professions down the ages. i had emphasised on the need to equip with modern tools those who wanted to continue with their traditional profession while simultaneously ensuring special quota and licence benefits to those who wanted to branch out. the other aspects were free education, better living conditions etc. the stress obviously was on economic uplift,"" he said. but the well-known differences between former prime minister indira gandhi and bahuguna saw the report being shelved. says sathi: ""bahuguna was removed within 13 days of constituting the commission. his successor nd tewari showed no inclination towards this issue. when i submitted the report in 1977, there were no takers in the congress for it. the upper caste bias was all too evident despite the lip sympathy for the sc/sts and mbcs."" the lip sympathy is bjp's hallmark also, he feels. sathi finds this sudden concern on the saffron party's part amusing, especially in the light of its opposition to the implementation of the mandal commission's report which eventually led to the fall of the vp singh government. ""mandal ko lekar hi to kamandal chala (the temple politics was a fallout of the mandal). the bjp had to take recourse to this stunt. mulayam walked off with the yadavs, some lal patel with the kurmis, kalyan singh with the lodhs and mayawati with the dalits. who was left with the bjp. the party on the eve of elections has raked up the issue of mbcs and extreme dalits. you can't have me believe that it is an apolitical decision,"" he says.

9,Govt can't fix urban development charges: HC,"hyderabad: a division bench of the ap high court comprising justice bilal nazki and justice e dharma rao has held that the power given to the government under the ap urban areas (development) act to fix developmental charges was unconstitutional. the bench declared that the amendment to section 28 of the act was void and ultra vires. the bench was dealing with a writ petition filed by the sidhartha academy of general and technical educational society complaining that the provision was arbitrary and illegal. c kodandaram, counsel for the petitioner, pointed out that before the amendment, the law provided that a maximum of rs 40,000 per hectare or rs 10 per sq metre be levied as development charges. under the present law, the power to fix the rate was given to the state government. kodandaram argued that, in the absence of a ceiling, the power was unconstitutional. speaking for the bench, justice nazki specifically pointed out: admittedly this amendment neither prescribes a limit nor lays down any guidelines to the delegatee. the bench also held that a visit to the statute would reveal that it contained no guidelines and would thus amount to uncanalised power. the bench ruled that such an uncontrolled power would not stand the judicial scrutiny.
