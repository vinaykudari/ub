1,"Govt, admn blamed for Gujarat riots","PATNA: The seventh Chandrashekhar memorial lecture held by Punashcha was delivered on Friday by social activist Harsh Mander here at the A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

The topic of the lecture was â€œIndia after Gujaratâ€�.

Mander, who resigned from the Indian Administrative Service after the Gujarat riots, spoke about his experience during and after the riots.

â€œI am still unable to understand how our society, which is known for tolerance and brotherhood, can become so barbaric and cruel. This barbarism is unimaginable,â€� he said.

Blaming the government and administration fully for what happened in Gujarat, he said, â€œFrom my experience in administrative service, I can say with guarantee that no riot can last more than one hour if the administration and government take immediate action.â€�

â€œAnd now even if we try to forget what happened during the riots, we cannot forget what happened and what government did after the riots,â€� he said detailing how people living in camps suffered during scorching summer and rain.

Talking about the Prime Ministerâ€™s Gujarat visit, he said, â€œthe Prime Minister announced compensation of Rs 50,000, but in reality only 10 per cent of the deserved people received a bit more than Rs 10,000.â€�

â€œIrrespective of what the government did and does, we common people will have to come ahead and save the humanity,â€� he added.

2,‘Absconding’ officer turns up as minister’s secretary,"HYDERABAD: A senior government officer facing inquiries, disciplinary action and said to be â€œabscondingâ€� for sometime, has surfaced as personal secretary to newly-appointed labour minister P Babu Mohan, causing ripples in the official and ministerial circles.

Rufus Dattam, who was chief planning officer (CPO) in Medak district from where the minister hails, has joined the peshi of Babu Mohan, the actor turned politician recently even as the officials of the statistical department are looking out for him.

Significantly, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has been cautioning his cabinet colleagues to be extra careful in selecting their personal secretaries. He had in fact made a couple of his ministers to change their personal staff who faced corruption charges.

Sources said that Dattam had been facing charges for irregularities when he was working in Medak and the government had initiated an inquiry. Subsequently, the officer was transferred to Mahabubnagar district, but he went on leave.

After the expiry of leave, he had not bothered to apply for fresh leave and the senior officials of the statistical department were about to proclaim Dattam as absconding and planning to lodge a police complaint. But he was found in the peshi of the labour minister.

Officers working in the CPO office in both Medak and Mahabubnagar districts are tight lipped on the whereabouts of Dattam.

However, the employees working in the CPO office in Medak said that Dattam was transferred â€œlong agoâ€�. Officials were astonished that his new appointment was cleared by the general administration department without clearance from his parent department.

However, the matter is being taken to the highest level and action is likely to be initiated against Dattam.

3,CGG leaves little impact on govt,"HYDERABAD: The much-touted Centre for Good Governance started with a single-point agenda of providing solutions for good governance, appears to be fast turning into a â€œCentre for Gandaragolamâ€� (centre for pandemonium).

The Department for International Development (DFID, UK)-funded institute was formed with the hope that it would come up with interventions to reduce bottlenecks, plug loopholes and offer suggestions to make the government machinery run smoothly.

But so far no concrete suggestions have been made in that direction. Senior government officials, who are closely monitoring the functioning of the CGG, feel that it is mostly handling things that normally should have been done by the heads of departments and secretaries.

â€œIt is interfering in the functioning of all the government departments and instead of offering solutions for good governance, the CGG itself had become a problem for usâ€�, a top official told The Times of India.

The CGG has designed formats to evaluate the performance ministers, which only evoked strong resentment from them.

The process indicators, prescribed by the CGG in addition to performance indicators, suggested that senior officers should undertake at least a ten-day tour to districts every month to study the functioning of their respective departments. This too also did not go down well with the officials.

The CGG has been keeping itself busy in the never-ending process of grading officers in the name of performance indicators.

Some senior officials said that the CGG failed to offer any suggestions to improve the quality of governance and instead limiting itself to comparing the performance of various departments against each other.

â€œThey compare incomparables and how can the revenue and the excise departments could be comparedâ€�, one senior officer asked.

In fact, majority of cabinet ministers opined that the CGG would not fetch them votes in the next assembly elections and wanted chief minister Chandrababu Naidu to disassociate himself from the Centre for the time being.

4,Alarming increase in drug abuse cases in Bihar,"PATNA: Drug abuse is rising alarmingly in Bihar. â€œThe sale of narcotics like heroin and ganja is no longer confined to the pan (betel leaf) stalls in remote lanes.

They are now being made available in front of schools and colleges,â€� said a senior officer at the police headquarters.

Though the police headquarters do not have reliable data on drug abuse, a paper prepared by the state home department for the Union home ministry indicates that the increase in the recovery of narcotics is itself a pointer to the growing number of drug abuse cases in Bihar.

In 1999, there were just 42 cases of recovery of heroin. The figure went up to 65 in 2001 with 212 offenders being arrested.

In respect of the trafficking in ganja, 61 cases were registered in 1999 against 86 persons. In 2001, the number of such cases more than doubled at 131 with the number of offenders going up to 238.

Earlier this year, the state police held a workshop on drug abuse with the help of the Narcotics Control Bureau.

DGP R R Prasad, speaking to mediapersons at that time, said that narcotics-related crimes affected more than half the districts in the state.

â€œItâ€™s the quick and easy money which is luring people to this trade,â€� he had remarked. Since Bihar lies on the drug route from the North East and Nepal to the mainland, the chances of a steep rise in drug abuse are greater.

Officials of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) say that once under pressure from the law enforcing agencies, narcotics traffickers tend to push their materials into the local markets instead of using Bihar as a transit point for catering to the markets of Kolkata, Delhi and other larger cities. Incidentally, the DRI has detected growing of illegal opium in the rural areas of Purnia.

In 1993, the state government had proposed to set up de-addiction centres at its medical college hospitals.

However, since then the efforts of the state home department to locate the file has proved to be futile.

Lately, a fresh proposal has been prepared for setting up de-addiction centres at all the six government medical college hospitals in the state.

The principals of the medical colleges and the superintendents of the hospitals attached to them have been asked to prepare a project report for the de-addiction centres so that the state can avail of the Union governmentâ€™s existing scheme under which Rs 80 lakh is provided as assistance for such a centre.

However, the principals have said that the fund is being provided only for infrastructure and that the state government is required to provide land and to ensure the availability of medical care under the supervision of duly trained doctors.

The state government has asked the Centre to provide it with funds to meet the recurring expenditure of the de-addiction centres.

The response to the growing number of drug abuse cases has been largely â€œbureaucraticâ€� with pleas for funds to organise camps for creating mass awareness and setting up of a narcotics cell in the CID.

5,SC asks state govt to explain custody deaths,"NEW DELHI: The apex court on Friday sought the presence of the West Bengal chief secretary and home secretary to explain why the state government had not taken action against a DSP for allegedly destroying evidence against policemen charged in a custodial death case.

A division Bench directed them to appear before it on November 15 to explain the position.

The court was hearing a petition filed by the father of the victim of the alleged atrocity resulting in his death on April 9, 1997.

Since the father had died during the pendency of the petition, the court had appointed advocate Krishan Mahajan to assist it in the adjudication of the petition.

Mahajan said West Bengal Human Rights Commission had said Jadavpur DSP Abhijitsen Gupta, who was probing the case of the custodial death of 22-year-old Babai Biswas, had â€˜prima facieâ€™ tried to destroy the evidence to save the police officials allegedly involved in the case.

Despite its report and filing of chargesheet against the DSP, he remained in service and no action had been taken by the government against him, Mahajan said.

The court sought the presence of the officials as the West Bengal counsel could not explain how the DSP, charged with a criminal offence, could continue in service as it amounted to violation of the service rules.

8,Oil price stabiliy key to India's economic development: Naik,"OSAKA: Voicing concern over the volatile world oil price scenario, Petroleum Minister Ram Naik on Sunday said price stability at sustainable level was necessary for an Indian economy whose major sectors are dependent on it.

""It is imperative that for economic development, the cost of country''s major energy source -- hydrocarbons remains at stable which a common man in a developing country can afford"", he said here.

On the upstream sector he said, the fourth round of NELP (New Exploration and Licensing Policy) is planned for next year.

Referring to the downstream sector, Naik said 100 per cent foreign investment is allowed in oil refining while seeking participation from global oil companies to participate in the three grassroot refinery projects at Paradeep, Bina and Bhatinda.

He also invited companies to explore opportunities in the coal bed methane energy sources adding the second round of bidding for CBM blocks is planned early in 2003.

10,4 more ministers join anti-Badal campaign,"CHANDIGARH: Four more ministers have joined the anti-Badal campaign blaming him for delay in announcing the minimum support price (MSP) and working against the interests of the farmers.

In a joint communique issued here on Sunday, health minister RC Dogra, irrigation minister Gurchet Singh Bhuller, technical education minister Mohinder Singh Kaypeee and public health minister Jasjit S. Randhawa have contested the statement of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal that the state government had done little to prepone the procurement and early announcement of the MSP for paddy.

Earlier, six other senior ministers too had lambasted Badal for his outburst against the government.

Also, these ministers have taken strong exception to the statement of the junior minister of labour at Centre Ashok Pradhan that the state government had not presented case of Punjab farmers before the Union government.

â€œPradhan was totally ignorant of how vigorously chief minister Amarinder Singh had pursued the matter of early fixation of MSP with prime minister and union food ministerâ€�, they asserted.

Giving more details, these minister pointed out Amarinder Singh had sent a letter to the prime minister on September 17 on the issue and sought a meeting of the chief ministers of the states contributing to the Central pool be convened.

Also, the CM had sent detailed letters to the Union food minister and to PMâ€™s principal secretary Brajesh Mishra and also urged for fast movement of foodgrains from the state to ensure enough storing space for ensuing paddy crop.

From the ministersâ€™ statement itâ€™s evident that the Punjab government had raked up the issue only after September 17 when the paddy had already started pouring in mandis. However, these ministers question what Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa had done for early procurement.

These ministers have hailed the chief minister for giving top priority to the farm sector and in face of unprecedented drought the government could provide sufficient electricity supply to farmers. On the contrary, they accused Badal and other senior Akali leaders tried to make political capital out of the natural calamity.

11,Badungar appeals for SGPC general elections,"LUDHIANA: Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) president Kirpal Singh Badungar made a fresh request on Sunday to the home ministry to conduct the SGPC general elections due for the last two years.

Talking to newspersons at Gurdwara Model Town Extension here, Badungar refuted the charges made by the SHSAD president Gurcharan Singh Tohra that the ministry was deliberately causing delay in elections at the behest of SAD president Parkash Singh Badal.

Badungar said that he himself had written five times to the ministry regarding this. Holding elections was the responsibility of the Central government, he added.

Since the matter pertained to the SGPC, Badungar said it was not proper to ask the SAD for taking up the issue before the government as it would lend the matter political colour. However, he would abide by the party decision regarding his candidature as the SGPC president for the second term, he added in the same breath. The SGPC president will be elected in November this year.

Referring to recently reported vigilance raids at the residences of two SGPC members from Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts, Badungar said that he had brought the matter to the notice of Punjab Vigilance Bureau director A P Pandey.

According to Badungar, Pandey had told him that the raids were the handiwork of some impostors as these were not conducted by the vigilance department.

Reiterating that the act was part of larger conspiracy to intimidate the SGPC members to shift loyalties in view of the forthcoming SGPC presidentâ€™s election, Badungar said a demand had been made to identify and nab the culprits soon.

The SGPC president warned chief minister Amarinder Singh from interfering in Sikh religious matters at the behest of Tohra whose aim was to wrest control of this supreme Sikh religious body for political ends.

Earlier, during a meeting with the SGPC president about nine Sikh youth organisations decided to chalk out a joint programme to create awareness in Punjab particularly among the Sikhs to shun social evils like dowry, drug addiction and female foeticide keeping with the Sikh religious teachings.

The meeting also decided to constitute a committee to implement the programme by 2004.

12,Desecration incidents increase tension in Belgaum,"BELGAUM: Communal tension, triggered by the alleged defacement of a prayer hall in Tilakwadi locality, continued to grip Belgaum on Sunday with members of the two communities resorting to desecration of places of worship.

Fresh incidents of desecration on Sunday reignited the dying embers of communal clash that resulted in four persons suffering injuries besides scores of houses and vehicles being damaged in stone-throwing.

The police resorted to a mild lathicharge to disperse a crowd that had gathered on Pune-Bangalore national highway in Old Gandhinagar protesting desecration of a prayer house inside the Fort. The protesters targeted vehicles and rained stones on houses belonging to a particular community.

Berating the police for resorting to lathicharge, more then 200 women from Old Gandhinagar rushed towards the Fort, staged a dharna and gheraoed Belgaum Deputy Commissioner Renuka Chidambaram for about 30 minutes. They urged her to take action against miscreants who threw stones on their houses.

Later, they took out a procession in Old Gandhinagar but were disallowed into New Gandhinagar fearing law and order problem. Men were not allowed to stir out of their house.

Arson was reported from Kotwalgalli and Bandurgalli areas of Belgaum.

Prohibitory orders have been clamped in Belgaum for three days and will remain in force till Tuesday. Security has been further tightened and the situation, though tense, was under control, the police said.

Twenty trouble-makers have been taken into custody.

Shops and commercial establishments remained closed and vehicles remained off the roads.

The District Armed Reserve police has been called in to help the local police tackle further untoward incidents.

13,National policy on adolescence proposed,"NEW DELHI: The second most populous country in the world has around 260 million adolescents â€” individuals between the age group of 10 and 19 years, as per the WHO definition â€” which accounts for about 23 per cent of its population.

In order to address the problems faced by adolescents and to transform them into an asset for the country, the Planning Commission has for the first time felt the need for formulating a national policy on adolescents in India. The Commission, in collaboration with the Urivi Vikram Charitable Trust (UVCT), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) working for the empowerment of young adults, has endeavoured to draft a policy framework for adolescents in India. A core group led by former education secretary Anil Bordia has been constituted to recommend various schemes for the betterment of adolescents.

The schemes, when finalised, will be incorporated in the 10th Five Year Plan. Recently, the UVCT, in association with the Commonwealth Association of Media Persons for Social Development (CAMP), organised a regional meet on â€˜A National Policy on Adolescentsâ€™ in Delhi. The purpose of the meet was to create an environment in which experts from various fields and young adults could interact and address the problems faced them.

The meet was presided over by Planning Commission deputy chairperson K C Pant. Pant said adolescence was an age which was full of promise and pitfalls. According to him, adolescents should be provided the right channels to utilise their energy and achieve their goals.

The efforts for formulating a national policy on adolescents had, in fact, begun in July 1999, when the UVCT along with some government agencies, NGOs, and representatives from the United Nations, came forward to prepare a forum towards a â€˜National Policy for the Young Adultsâ€™. The forum made some recommendation to the Planning Commission in December 2000, which was immediately approved by the Commission.
