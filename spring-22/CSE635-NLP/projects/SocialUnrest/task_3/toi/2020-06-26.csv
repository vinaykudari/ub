0,Panchayat polls: BJP moves HC against officials,"PATHANKOT: The BJP has moved Punjab and Haryana High Court against the alleged foul play and dubious role of the election officials in rejecting the nomination papers of the party nominee for the post of sarpanch of Gosainpur panchayat in Sujanpur. The party has said that the nomination of its candidate as sarpanch was cancelled and even the papers of the covering candidate were rejected.

A former BJP minister alleged the papers were rejected without any reason at the behest of housing and urban development minister Raghu Nath Sahai. He said that when the party approached ADC (D) Bahadur Singh, incharge of the panchayat poll in Gurdaspur and the state election commissioner, both the officials failed to mitigate their complaint.

The BJP leaders said since the officials concerned were conniving with the ruling Congress, a writ petition was filed in the high court, which was admitted for hearing on July 1, 2003.

Alleging large scale irregularities in the panchayat poll, BJP leaders said the Congress minister had failed to provide both Central and state funds to the panchayats in Sujanpur constituency. They said irregularities in the voting list and cancellation of the nomination papers of opposition candidates was a murder of democracy.

2,Council chairman pulls up minister,"PATNA: Junior jail minister Ashok Choudhari was taken to task by the legislative council chairman, Jabir Hussain, on Thursday for not behaving properly in the House. Sensing trouble, Choudhari promptly tendered an apology.

Earlier, Choudhari''s reply over the issue of overcrowded jails in the state caused uproar in the House as several members, cutting across party lines, put a number of supplementary questions during the pre-lunch session.

The issue of overcrowded jails in the state was raised by CPM member Basudev Singh through a short-notice question. Singh sought to know from the government about the arrangements made by the jails to cope with overcrowding. Jail minister Basawan Bhagat was replying to the question when Choudhari rose in his seat and intervened. Many members objected to his intervention when the senior minister was speaking. Council chairman Jabir Hussain asked the minister to behave properly, keeping in mind the sentiments expressed by the members.

The chairman also asked ministers to come to the House with full preparation for reply to the questions of members.

After the pre-lunch session, Choudhari met the Council chairman in his chamber in the House.

3,CM Munda to pull Lord's chariot,"JAMSHEDPUR: Caught in the push and the pull of coalition politics, Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda has turned to Lord Jagannath and decided to pull the Lord''s chariot in his constituency on July 1.

Munda announced on Thursday that he would lead the 5-kilometer-long â€œRath Yatraâ€�in this assembly constituency, Kharsawan, in Saraikela-Kharsawan district next month. The chief minister hopes the obeisance offered to Lord Jagannath would bring prosperity, peace and stability to the state.

Lord Jagannath seems to have attained a special significance in the wobbly Jharkhand politics. Before Munda, a group of coalition ministers made a trip to Puri to seek Lord Jagannath''s blessing to oust former chief minister Babulal Marandi. Their prayers were answered and the ministers paid a second visit to express their gratitude.

Now Munda, who took over the reins of power, a little over three months ago, has ordered the local administration to make elaborate arrangements for the ailing Lord''s journey to â€œmashir badiâ€� or maternal aunts home.

About Rs 10 lakh was being reportedly spent on construction of the new chariot. The government has to bear the cost of all major religious festivities in the erstwhile princely state of Kharsawan as per an agreement between the Indian union and former royal family, Munda pointed out.

Munda personally flew down to the Steel City apparently to oversee the constriction of grand chariot. He has also involved the state tourism department for the revival of nearly six-century-old tradition at Kharsawn. The chief minister also proposes to use the opportunity to announce new schemes and run literacy campaign.

Munda, nevertheless, has to worry about the stability of his government that enjoys a wafer-thin majority in the House.

His finance minister and senior BJP legislator M P Singh a few days ago offered to resign for the chief minister''s comment on the state budget. The alliance partners reportedly had their daggers out on the issue of state electricity board restructuring sometime back.

Munda''s close friend and senior BJP leader Suryu Roy has been locked in a bitter verbal duel with energy minister Lalchand Mahato and science and technology minister Samresh Singh. The chief minister publicly rued the system had collapsed.

However, on Thursday, Munda made a U-turn and insisted he had been misquoted and misunderstood. The government has been running with the cooperation of everyone. The finance minister has misconstrued my remark. He is a senior minister and makes valuable contribution towards the development of the state.

The chief minister also rubbished reports on growing discontent among coalition ministers. He parried question on the proposed cabinet expansion apparently placate disgruntled BJP legislators.

4,Rivers rise but govt downplays flood threat,"PATNA: While some rivers of Bihar continued to rise, water resources department stated that the flood situation in the state is not alarming.

""The water level has shown a rising trend, but the situation is not alarming,"" stated an official of the department, pointing out that the rain water has caused flood-like situation in low-lying areas, like certain areas in Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur, and places where there are gaps in the embankments.

Meanwhile, according to water resources department sources, a special team led by commissioner V Jaishankar is heading for Areraj block in East Champaran to inspect the gap in the Gandak embankment at Nagdaha. The department has called for tenders several times to fill up the gap, but no contractor submitted bids. With water level of the river rising, the gap is causing anxiety to the department and a technical team will plan ways to fill up the gap.

According to the official bulletin, the Adhwara group of rivers are flowing 40 cms above the danger mark at Kamtaul and are expected to rise further by five cm on Friday morning. However, other major rivers like the Gandak, Bagmati and Kosi continue to flow below the danger mark.

6,Energy minister jeered in House,"PATNA: Bihar energy minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan faced acute embarrassment in the assembly on Thursday when he was responding to the complaint of a ruling party MLA, Shobhakant Mandal. The lights of the House suddenly went out and there was complete darkness, making the BJP members to jeer the minister.

Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha of the BJP remarked that the name of the energy department should be changed to ""lantern"" department.

Mandal complained that a live wire had broken loose at his official residence. The live wire posed a threat to his family members, he insisted. He alleged that repeated pleas to energy department officials were of no avail. ""This is the plight of a ruling party MLA,"" remarked the Speaker, Sadanand Singh. ""If he had approached us, we would have got his work done immediately,"" remarked energy minister Khan. At this point, the lights went out in the House, making opposition MLAs jeer the minister.

""The Speaker should direct Khan and his junior minister Shyam Rajak to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the assembly when it is in session,"" remarked leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi.

Incidentally, replying to a question of Upendra Prasad Singh, AHD minister Sitaram Singh conceded that power supply to the Fishery Research Centre in Patna had been stopped in 1993. ""But this does not mean that the centre is dysfunctional,â€� he remarked.

The minister stated that money had been deposited with the BSEB and power supply to the centre should be restored within a week.

7,State govt accused of neglecting disabled,"HYDERABAD: Disabled persons, especially blind and deaf, are being meted out a raw deal by the government as the Persons With Disabilities (PWD) Act is not implemented in its letter and spirit by Andra Pradesh, complained several representatives of organisations for disabled, while speaking to reporters on Wednesday.

The meet was jointly held by Deaf Reach-Creed, Association for Integrated Development of Blind and Caring Aid for Visually Impaired to apprise the media of the arrangements underway for the birth anniversary celebrations of Helen Keller on June 27.

Five persons will be given awards for their life-time services to the deaf and the blind. For the last three years, the government has stopped giving monthly allowance of Rs 75 tot eh disabled, said president of the Deaf Art and Cultural Society, K Seshagiri Rao.

This has serious implications for the disabled, particularly when they find it difficult to find jobs. The provisions of PWD Act, which prescribes 3 per cent reservations in government jobs and 5 per cent in private jobs for the disabled are not enforced, Rao said.

â€œThe deaf are in need of interpreters,â€� said Christine Lazarus, convener of Deaf Reach-Creed. The present budgetary allocation of Rs 20 crore for welfare activities should be increased to at least to Rs 100 crore, she added.

8,Hubli mayoral elections on Friday,"HUBLI: The Congress and the Janatha Parivar were inching closer to striking a deal late Thursday, for elections to the posts of mayor and deputy to be held on Friday. Talk was on about the mayorâ€™s post being earmarked for Congress and the deputyâ€™s for the Parivar.

Karnataka Minister for Animal Husbandry M. Mahadev who has been appointed Congress observer arrived in Hubli on Thursday and is learnt to have held several rounds of talks with Janatha Parivar MLC Basavaraj Bommai.

The Congress being the single largest party in the HDMC council depends on the support lent by the Janatha Parivar to clinch power. The two parties have been sharing power, with the mayorâ€™s post going to Congress and deputy mayorâ€™s to the Janatha Parivar from the last two years.

In the 67 member council, the Congress has 24 members, followed by BJP with 22, Janatha Parivar with 16 and five Independents. Besides, two legislators of the Congress, four MLCs and one MP of the Parivar, two MLAs of BJP have voting powers. BJP has lost one vote with the resignation of Vijay Sankeshwar from the party. Though he has resigned from the MPâ€™s post also, his resignation has not been accepted by the Lok Sabha Speaker.

With elections just 12 hours away, the aspirants for the mayorâ€™s post has come down to three from the earlier six likely contenders in Congress. The Floor leader in the council Anil Kumar Patil, first time corporator Mohan Veerabadhrappa Asunde and Razuoiya Begum Sangolli are the aspirants from the Congress.

Sources in the Congress said, Hubli MLA was in favour of Floor leader Anil Kumar Patil and was in favour of Asundi or Raziya Begum for the mayorâ€™s post. But the selection of the party candidate would depend on the suggestions of the party observers who was holding closed door negotiations at a city hotel late Thursday. The party is likely to issue a whip asking its party members to strictly vote for the party candidate only on Friday morning.

Having supported the Congress candidates for the mayorâ€™s post for two years senior corporator from the Parivar Lakshmana Hanumanthappa Hirekerur was very keen to clinch the mayorâ€™s post even with BJP support if need be, but the move was thwarted by a senior leader in the Janatha Parivar, sources said.

The BJP too has its own strategy, and is engaged in a bid to woo some Janatha Parivar members and two Independents. The calculation of the BJP is that Congress and Janatha Parivar members may cross vote if a particular aspirant is made the Congress candidate.

The BJP, in any case, is likely to have its own candidate in the Friday elections. The post of the mayor has been allotted to General Category this time and the deputy mayorâ€™s post to Other Backwards Castes.

11,Naidu dares Cong to development debate,"HYDERABAD: In his first address to the reconstituted politburo and state executive of the TDP on Thursday, party chief Chandrababu Naidu said his party would win the elections and blasted the Congress and its leaders.

Naidu called on TDP leaders to highlight the â€œmisdeedsâ€� of Congress regimes and cautioned people that Congress leaders were against development. He said the earlier Congress governments were sunk in corruption and claimed that the TDP had a clean record. Taking a dig at Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy for undertaking a padayatra, Naidu said, padayatras have become a fancy for the Congress leaders. The fact that they received only personal petitions during the padayatra reflects the good performance of the government.â€�

Naidu challenged the Congress to a debate on development in the state, comparing the progress achieved by the state and any other Congressruled state. He ridiculed Reddy for failing to develop his Pulivendula constituency in spite of being its public representative for 25 years.

The chief minister reiterated that he was prepared to lead an all-party delegation to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on the irrigation projects being â€œillegally constructedâ€� by Karnataka. Naidu said he would not hesitate to meet Sonia Gandhi to brief her on the crisis to solve the issue. He criticised the Karnataka government for violating norms and constructing projects on the Upper Tunga.

Naidu blamed S M Krishna for referring to Telugu Ganga and other old projects in AP in his memorandum to the Centre. Referring to the police firing on farmers in Chevella, Naidu termed it unfortunate and said that he would take action against those responsible. Naidu also assured Telugu Desam Party leaders that the party would get the credit for all government programmes in future.

According to party sources, responding to the suggestions from leaders during the two-day extended party meet on Thursday, Naidu said that view of the forthcoming elections, he would ensure that the TDP derived mileage from all government programmes. Sources said that party leaders informed Naidu that all political parties were deriving mileage from government programmes leaving the TDP high and dry.

12,"Photographer killed, assailants arrested","LUCKNOW: Barely eight hours after the sensational murder of a photo studio owner at Rajajipuram on Thursday afternoon, the police have cracked the case. The computer system, camera and cash robbed by the miscreants were recovered after the police managed to trace one of the killers and three others.

SP (West) Umesh Singh said that body of one Rajeev Rastogi, a resident of Rajajipuram, was found at his Bandhu Studio near his house at Rishi Market on Thursday. He had been murdered by a sharp-edged weapon, and sustained severe injuries on his neck and head. His body was found by Deepak Kumar, owner of Mahalaxmi Electricals, situated adjacent to the photo studio.

Later, the police reached the studio along with the victimâ€™s father Jagdish Dutt Rastogi. It was later discovered that the computer installed there, a camera, and the money from the cash-box were missing. The victimâ€™s family members suspected that he died while resisting the robbers.

The police learnt that two men, in their early 20s, arrived at the studio around 11:40 am on a rickshaw driven by a Nepalese. The youths left the shop after 10 minutes carrying a computer with them.

The rickshaw-puller Ganesh Bahadur, a resident of Nepal, was later arrested. He confessed to have taken the youths one Vikasâ€™ house in Talkatora police circle. Vikas (20) was also arrested after the stolen computer was recovered from his house. â€œVikas revealed that he had given the stolen camera to his friend Ravnish Srivastava (20), who was also later arrested,â€� Singh added.

Both of them told the police that the computer and the camera were given to them by their friend Ranjit (25), a native of Barabanki. He was staying at his in-lawsâ€™ place in Bazarkhala, they added. Later, Ranjit was arrested in an inebriated state.

Ranjit disclosed that his friend Rahul had accompanied him to the studio, and the latter murder Rajeev.

The police dispatched a team to Kanpur to trace Rahul. However,Ranjit continued to baffle the police with his incoherent statements about the motive for the murder.

13,Trinamul in a tizzy over protest letter,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress MLA Dipak Ghoshâ€™s letter to fellow legislators, questioning party chief Mamata Banerjeeâ€™s decision to boycott the rest of the Budget session of the state Assembly, may open a Pandoraâ€™s Box within the party.

The long letter also questioned several of Mamataâ€™s past decisions, describing them as â€œhistoric blundersâ€�.

A senior Trinamul leader agreed that some other party MLAs could be supporting Ghoshâ€™s move.

Sources said that Mamata was very upset when she came to know about the letter in Delhi on Wednesday evening.

She felt there was instigation from the CPM and the Congress to split her party. The Trinamul leadership decided to issue a show-cause notice against Ghosh.

â€œIt is an attacking letter, criticising Mamata bitterly and tarnishing the image of the party,â€� Leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee said.

Kolkata mayor Subrata Mukherjee said Ghoshâ€™s letter would be referred to the party disciplinary committee if he did not reply to the show-cause notice within seven days.

â€œIf he criticises the partyâ€™s decisions at all levels, he should resign as a Trinamul legislator and get himself re-elected.â€�

The leaders pleaded ignorance, however, of some other MLAs supporting Ghosh. Banerjee said he had not received a similar letter from another party legislator, Arunava Ghosh.

Ghoshâ€™s letter not only described the boycott decision as â€œsuicidalâ€�, but also said that the party should have taken more seriously the chief ministerâ€™s appeal last month to withdraw the boycott.

It called into question several other decisions of Mamata, like giving the BJP a ditch and tying up with the Congress in the last Assembly elections.

14,"Pak govt, Opp set for showdown in Parliament","SLAMABAD: Pakistan''s agitating opposition parties and the government are set for another round of confrontation in Parliament on Saturday with the parties deciding to take out a protest march to coincide with the vote on no-confidence motion moved by them against the Speaker for declaring President Pervez Musharraf''s constitutional amendments as legal.

""We will march to the parliament building in a procession tomorrow (Saturday) for a debate and vote on the no-trust motion,"" Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal parliamentary leader Qazi Hussian Ahmed told reporters.

The march would start from the parliament lodges near Parliament and would converge on parliament house to protest against the government''s ""anti-people"" policies, senior PPP leader Makhdoom Amin Fahim said.

From there, the rally would move on to the adjacent Supreme Court building to protest against pro-Musharraf''s rulings by the court, he said.

The protest coincides with the National Assembly taking up the opposition''s no-trust motion against Speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain for his ruling that Legal Framework Order (LFO) issued by Musharraf was legal.

The government has already warned that it would take stern action if the rally created law and order problems.

Explaining the reasons for holding the march outside the Supreme Court, Fahim alleged the judiciary had been made ""hostage"" under the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) issued by Musharraf. ""As long as this situation prevailed, he said, none of people''s problems would be solved"".

15,Former Karnataka minister dies in accident,"BELLARY: Former minister and Congress MLA S R Kashappanavar died in a car accident near Kudligi in Bellary district on Friday.

The accident occurred at 3.40 am, when Kashappanavar''s Scorpio jeep tried to overtake a truck in M B Aiyanahalli village about 120 km from here. The jeep''s driver, Mustafa, lost control and the vehicle rolled over and fell into a ditch.

Kashappanavar (54 years old) died on the spot, while his driver with serious injuries was shifted to a hospital in Kudligi.

Kashappanavar was on his way to Bangalore from Ilkal in Bijapur district. His body was taken to his constituency Hungund in Bagalkot district and the last rites performed. He is survived by his wife and two sons.

Chief Minister S M Krishna rushed his ministers H K Patil, A B Malaaka Raddy and R B Thimmapur in a helicopter to the spot, while animal husbandry minister M Mahadev, who was touring in Bellary, was one of the first to reach.

It was exactly a year ago that Kashappanavar, who was in charge of small-scale industries was dropped from the ministry, when Krishna reshuffled his cabinet. Upset over the move, the late former minister, who represented Panchamashali (Lingayat sub-sect) had approached the Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

A three-term MLA from Hungund, Kashappanavar was hauled up by the Maharashtra police for crossing into the state and attempting to release water from the Ujini dam to barrages in Bijapur. On another occasion he had walked into the Legislative Council hall when the session was on and started a conversation with one of the ministers.

16,Pvt colleges refuse to give more seats to state govt,"BANGALORE: Private college managements on Friday toughened their stand and said they would not part with more than 50 per cent of seats to the state government.

Counsel for Consortium of Private Medical, Engineering, Dental Colleges in Karnataka (COMED) Kapil Sibal and Rajeev Dhawan argued before the division bench comprising Justices R V Raveendran and K L Manjunath that the government''s 75:25 per cent seat sharing formula was not acceptable to them.

""We are clear in our stand that we cannot part with more than 50 per cent seats. The state has misinterpreted the Supreme Court''s order to restrict our freedom which is not acceptable to us,"" Sibal said.

Dhawan said the government had ""wrongly interpreted"" the Apex Court order to accord them a higher share of seats. This wrong interpretation has restored the system back to the Unnikrishnan judgement.

""The Apex Court has said a ''certain'' percentage of seats should be given to the government but how is it decided? We felt 75 per cent seats should be retained by us and 25 per cent seats to the government. But, we proposed to give 50 per cent seats to the government which is actually much beyond our share,"" he contended.

With COMED and the state government sticking to their stands, the division bench reserved the orders for Monday. After the COMED proposed to fill 50 per cent seats in unaided non-minority professional institutions through the Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell, the state government declined to accept the proposal and said it should be allowed to fill 75 per cent seats to protect the interest of students.

Arguing before the bench, ABVP counsel Ashok Harnahalli and VTU counsel Basavaprabhu Patil submitted that the government''s time tested CET-based admission process should not be disturbed as it would be detrimental to studentsâ€™ interest.

Citing SC''s order, private college managements cannot seek a contravention of the government''s regulation. ""Besides, only about four engineering colleges of the total 107 have appealed against the government''s regulations. For the sake of four colleges, the entire system should not be disturbed,"" Patil said.

Harnahalli argued that the government''s regulations were based on the guidelines of the All India Council for Technical Education and the union ministry of health and family welfare. The division bench directed students counsel Kashinath Rao Patil to submit in writing his objections and arguments which would be considered before the orders are passed.

Placing its proposal on seat sharing and fee structure before the division bench on Wednesday, COMED said it would be an interim arrangement only as their objections to the government''s professional courses admission rules citing violation of the Supreme Court order in the TMA Pai Foundation case are yet to be heard.

17,It's mission networking for ministers' PAs,"BANGALORE: If you were to call up a ministerâ€™s office today, not a single private secretary would answer the phone.

All the 45 secretaries are on a networking mission -- they are huddled together to get hands-on training to become computer literate.

Although one would see computers in the ministers ante room, these were nothing but glorified typewriters -- used for preparing reports and typing letters. None was connected to any centralised network and even if it was on the intranet (in one particular department where about 2-3 PCs would be connected), none of the ministers private secretaries would actually operate the system themselves. It would invariably be their subordinates who would work on it for routine typing work.

Says Rajeev Chawla, Karnataka e-governance secretary,"" A couple of weeks back we decided that all the PAs to the ministers should have some knowledge at least on how to operate a computer -- it would make things simpler for the person at the helm and he could keep a track of all files and letters,""

Now, with the new software (developed by NIC) deployed in all the departments of the secretariat and the MS building, the private secretaries could keep a tab on the 1.5 lakh files that move everyday.

Apart from this, thousands of letters that crisscross the corridors could also be monitored through this letter and file monitoring system.

"" Now, if someone meets the private secretary of a minister to check up about an approval needed or any other detail of his project, all the PA has to do is log onto the network to track the file and can easily find out at which stage it is at, "" Chawla added.

Says Dev Anand, PA to the Muzrai minister, "" I am not computer savvy -- it would always be my assistants who would operate the computer which was again meant only for preparing reports. I came here thinking it is going to be a waste of time, like the usual way all the training sessions are to oldies like us. But, now what I am seeing here is remarkable -- you can actually find out where any file or letter is without having to call that respective department, be put on hold or receive the standard reply that they will get back to you with the information.""

Interestingly this department alone receives 200 letters per week apart from the daily files that move up and down.

According to PK Subbiah, PA to the agriculture minister, V S Kaujalgi, ""We get at least 20-25 letters per day regarding supply of seeds, transfer of officials and non performance of officers. Now, with this software tracking would be become simpler.""

Going by child-like excitement mixed with pure concentration, this training session sure looks like one heady mix of work and pleasure. And, if connectivity holds good, the software does not develop major glitches, and private secretaries actually do manage to get off the phones they are whispering into, files and letters are no longer going to disappear in the maze called Vidyan Soudha. Hopefully.

18,Growth in personal income in US up by 0.3 pc: Report,"WASHINGTON: Growth in personal incomes outpaced a modest increase in US consumer spending in May, the government said in a report on Friday.

The Commerce Department said income grew by 0.3 per cent in May, after being up a revised 0.2 per cent in April. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, posted a modest 0.1 per cent gain in the month.

May marked the second month in a row that income growth outpaced spending, which allowed the personal saving rate, the percentage of income left over after expenses, to rise to 3.5 per cent, the highest since February''s 3.9 per cent.

The numbers showed a cautious but relatively strong US household sector. While the spending data came in slightly below Wall Street expectations, the income numbers should ease worries about family balance sheets. With incomes expected to rise in coming months, spending should also perk up, analysts say.

The report also showed inflationary pressures well in check. The price index for personal spending fell for a second straight month, dipping 0.1 per cent overall and was unchanged excluding volatile food and energy prices.

For the 12 months ended in May, the overall index was up only 1.7 per cent and the ""core"" index rose 1.2 per cent. Excluding a 1.0 per cent rise in the 12-month period ending September 2001, the rise in the core price index through May was the smallest since October 1965.

Federal Reserve officials in recent weeks have expressed more concern about further decreases in inflation, one factor that led the central bank to cut its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday.

""The probability, though minor, of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. On balance, the Committee believes that the latter concern is likely to predominate for the foreseeable future,"" the Fed said.

On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported the US economy grew at an anemic 1.4 per cent annual rate in the first three months of 2003, matching the slow rate of growth in the final quarter of 2002.

That pace may pick up in the second quarter if spending is maintained. Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was up a healthy 0.3 per cent for a second straight month in May.

Analysts are optimistic that the combination of continued low interest rates and the initial effects of a $350 billion tax cut package will boost economic growth in coming months.

In mid-June, the Internal Revenue Service mailed new tax withholding tables to employers, which are to be used no later than July. The Treasury Department said the withholding changes are expected to put about $22 billion into the economy this year.

In addition, about 25.4 million checks totaling about $13 billion are to be mailed to middle-class families with children in late July and early August as advance payments for child tax credits expected to be claimed during next spring''s tax filing season.

19,Govt's 'waste policy' a waste,"NEW DELHI: Fresh from the printing press, the Union environment ministry''s new rules on hazardous waste are already in hot water, described by critics as too complex a â€œtextbookâ€� to tackle the mounting waste in areas as diverse as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, tanneries, the electronics industry and textiles.

Environmentalists even believe the rules, finalised last month, could effectively open the door to imports of some types of hazardous waste for recycling a revival of the dumping ground concept.

â€œThe rules are protective of industry, not of the environment,â€� says environmentalist Ravi Agarwal, who follows issues of waste. Not so, maintain ministry officials who have laboured two years to clear up the mess created by the rules of 2000. There is no easing of import norms. In fact, they view the amendments to the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules as a major achievement, though some admit the many â€œifs and butsâ€� could create confusion.

The rules define 36 streams which generate waste, make it mandatory for reprocessors and recyclers to register with the Central Pollution Control Board, set the ground rules on treatment, storage, disposal, technology and aim to â€œstreamlineâ€� the import-export policy. A great deal is at stake. The data available indicates that more than 9,000 industries across the country generate hazardous waste of all kinds. Thousands of tones of waste is imported every year for recyling. But only 250-odd recyclers have registered with the ministry in four years. This dangerous world defies â€œquick-fix solutionsâ€�, says an official.

Agarwal, however, is scathing: â€œCommon facilities for waste haven''t come up, landfill standards haven''t been implemented, hazardous waste inventorisation hasn''t been done, most waste units are in the small sector. Nobody knows what is actually coming in.â€�

An official agrees: â€œThere is no point in just amending rules, it becomes a theoretical exercise. The focus should have been on creating facilities, perhaps looking at critical areas like heavy metals first.â€� Other officials, however, argue that what they have done is important: Clearing up the confusion, defining responsibility and making reporting requirements are more stringent.

For instance, 29 types of hazardous waste are banned for import; others need compulsory registration. Definitions are clearer. There is now a distinction, for example, between used oil and waste oil, the first (used engine oil for example) can be recycled, the second (a crude oil spill for instance) cannot be recycled but can be burnt as fuel.

On the new list are processes of all kinds: Petrochemical processes, drilling for oil and gas, petroleum refining, primary or secondary production of lead and copper, metal surface treatment such as staining, polishing, plating, production of asbestos, iron and steel, caustic soda and chlorine, canvas and textiles, pulp and paper, even waste treatment processes such as incineration.

As the list gets longer, both sides share a concern. Many recycling units are small, illegal units operating out of homes. Who is going to control them? Who, for instance, is going to do something about waste oil from garages?

20,Nationalised banks to increase CDR in West Bengal,"KOLKATA: Nationalised banks operating in West Bengal have agreed to the state government''s proposal for increasing their credit-deposit ratio, Finance Minister Asim Dasgupta said on Friday.

Talking to newsmen after a meeting with RBI Deputy Governor V Kamesan and representatives of nationalised banks, Dasgupta said banks had a deposit base of Rs 80,000 crore in the state as per figures available till last December. Of this, 45.5 per cent was disbursed as loan in the state against the national average of 57 per cent.

""We wanted the CDR to be increased by three per cent yearly so that the 57 per cent figure can be reached in four years. The banks have agreed to this,"" Dasgupta said.

Pointing out that the banks currently provided Rs 400 crore loan to the state''s small industries sector against its requirement of Rs 3,000 crore, he said that it was agreed in the meeting that such loans would be increased by Rs 1,000 crore yearly till the required figure was achieved.

Dasgupta said that the banks agreed to provide Rs 2,000 crore loans to agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry sectors against Rs 1,000 crore being provided currently. The state''s requirement in those sectors, however, stood at Rs 10,000 crore, he said.

Self Employment Minister, Md Salim and secretaries of the Agriculture Industry and self employment departments were also present at the meeting.

21,"Gujarat's borrowings high, developmental expenditure down: RBI","GANDHINAGAR: The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report, ""State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2002-03"", reveals that Gujarat''s gross fiscal deficit (GFD) - the total borrowings of a state to finance its budget in a financial year - has been one of the highest in India.

At Rs 9,752.5 crore, the budget estimate for 2002-03 suggests that Gujarat''s GFD was next only to West Bengal, which is at Rs 11,315.2 crore.

Expressing serious concern over the trend that has engulfed all Indian states, the RBI''s initial remarks are noteworthy, ""The state governments have been experiencing fiscal stress in recent years as evident from large and increasing fiscal and revenue deficits. The rise in the GFD was pronounced in the second half of the 1990s, with an increasing high proportion being accounted for by the rising revenue deficit.""

Standing at Rs 5,815.9 crore in 2002-03, the revenue deficit of Gujarat too, is higher than all other states. West Bengal again is the only state ahead, at Rs 7,791.5 crore. As per cent of GFD, the state''s revenue deficit was 59.6 per cent. Only two other states - Kerala and West Bengal - used a higher per cent of GFD to finance their revenue deficits, 71.8 per cent and 68.9 per cent respectively.

Comments the RBI study, ""More than one-half of the GFD has been on account of revenue deficit. This implies that a significant proportion of the borrowed funds has been utilised for meeting revenue expenditure. The consequential accumulation of debt and debt service obligations has put constraints on the states'' ability to undertake developmental activity, viz, provision of economic and economic social infrastructure.""

The RBI figures show, the accumulated debts of Gujarat as in March-end 2003 stood at Rs 46,689 crore. The states with a higher debt than Gujarat were - Andhra Pradesh (Rs 50,638 crore), Maharashtra (Rs 61,324 crore), Uttar Pradesh including Uttaranchal (Rs 87,106 crore), and West Bengal (Rs 68,111 crore). In 2001 Gujarat''s debts were Rs 29,786 crore and in 2002 Rs 38,102 crore.

Quite in line with the RBI''s observation for the country, the result of higher borrowings to finance the budgetary deficits, leading to increase in debts, has had an adverse impact on Gujarat''s budgeted developmental expenditure. The budget estimate for 2002-03, quoted by the RBI, suggest that developmental expenditure has gone down by 8.3 per cent over the previous year! At Rs 19,763 crore now, they were Rs 21,551.8 crore in 2001-02.

This happened when most progressive states experienced a rise in developmental expenditure -Andhra Pradesh by 8.8 per cent, Haryana 9.4 per cent, Karnataka 15.5 per cent, Kerala 22.9 per cent, Punjab 11.2 per cent and Tamil Nadu 19.1 per cent. The only other progressive state that showed deceleration was Maharashtra which had a drop of 8.9 per cent. On the other hand, the Gujarat''s non-developmental expenditure rose by 10.5 per cent, from Rs 7,583.9 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 8,378.3 crore in 2002-03.

The RBI study reveals, just four states, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab, have initiated measures to ""provide statutory backing to the fiscal reform process through enabling legislations."" The result - Gujarat figures in the list of 10 states that have experienced ""lower rate of growth in revenue receipts."" Other states are - Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Haryana, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, West Bengal and Delhi.

The Gujarat government believes that the RBI study does not give the full picture of the state of finances. Official sources said the GFD should be revised as it does not calculate a rise in sales tax revenue by Rs 500 crore, a dip in interest payment by Rs 800 crore, and receipt of about Rs 300 crore as extra royalty. ""The GFD would be around Rs 7,200 crore finally, said one official.

23,Six hurt in clash with police,"KANNUR: About 170 farmers on Friday attacked an agriculture development bank in neighbouring Taliparamba, leading to a clash with police in which six people, including three police personnel, were injured, police said.

The farmers, including women, were led by ''Deshiya Karshaka Raksha Samiti'' chairman Jose Manipara, who demanded waiver of interest on agriculture loans. They were also protesting against the bank''s moves to attach properties for non payment of loans.

The farmers sought a meeting with the bank''s sales officer, but were not granted permission, after which they barged into the bank, forcing police to resort to a lathicharge.

Meanwhile, the samiti has called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal tomorrow in the hilly regions of the district to protest against the police lathicharge.

24,Cong chief against Badal's arrest,"CHANDIGARH: Beleaguered Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal got support from an unexpected quarter on Friday with Punjab Congress chief H S Hanspal saying he was not in favour of his arrest for â€œpetty economic offencesâ€� as it would amount to â€œpolitical vendettaâ€�.

â€œRight from the beginning, I am not in favour of Badalâ€™s arrest,â€� Hanspal told reporters here. â€œIn the normal course, Badal should not be arrested for petty economic offences. If he (Badal) is arrested on charges of small economic offences, it would amount to political vendetta,â€� he said.

On Tuesday, state vigilance bureau had registered a disproportionate assets case against Badal and some of his family members. The former chief minister was also questioned by vigilance sleuths here in connection with a multi-crore alleged irrigation scandal.

26,'Planning flaw hindered rescue work',"MUMBAI: It was ""an act of God"". That''s how B. Rajaram,managing director, Konkan Railway Corporation, explained the derailment of the Karwar-Mumbai holiday special train in Vaibhavwadi on Sunday in which 50 persons, including nine children, were killed.

But already, questions are being asked about safety issues and about how the KRC handled the accident.

Local railway officials said that the train, which was running over two hours behind schedule, was speeding at 100 km per hour despite the bad weather and the risky terrain.

""The train driver should have observed restraint and slowed down as it was pouring heavily,"" said Sanjay Malandkar, a Kankavli resident who survived the accident. ""The fact that this belt from Ratnagiri-Goa has a history of landslides and that it was the beginning of the monsoons should have been taken into consideration.""

He added that had the train been moving slower, the driver may have been able to avert the disaster. When the driver first applied the brakes, the train was running at full speed and ""all of us in the compartment were thrown out of our seats"", he added.

The rocks and mud from an adjoining hillock, just eight feet to ten feet away, fell on the tracks, causing the accident. ""The train was virtually moving on sand and rocks, which caused the derailment,"" said Mr Rajaram.

Local MLA and former chief minister Narayan Rane said that the KRC should shoulder responsibility for the accident. He wondered if a proper pre-monsoon survey for possible landslides had been carried out. He believed that the accident could have been averted if the slopes had been properly surveyed.

The KRC has a team of 30 officials, headed by a geologist, that is expected to carry out a survey before the monsoons.

Any loose soil or rock inside the tunnels is immediately cleared. Mr Rajaram said that a survey was done by his official but added remorsefully, ""that science and technology has failed us"". A local official of the district collectorate also pointed out that the narrow tunnel restricted movement.

He observed that had the train derailed after two bogies had gone inside the tunnel, it would have proved even more disastrous. The KRC planners should have made provisions for two tracks instead of a single one, he said. Rescue operations were greatly hindered because the tracks were hemmed in on either side by two huge hillocks, he added.

""It shows a severe flaw in the planning stage itself,"" another official said. ""The hillock is running cheek-by-jowl with the rail tracks and there is little space for movement on both sides. The rocks and mud which come sliding down will directly come on the tracks and a disaster is unavoidable. The KRC planners seem to have overlooked what even a layman can understand.""

Another hurdle in smooth relief work was the frequent visits of the VIPs to the accident spot. ""A small engine was used to ferry ministers between Kankavli and Vibhavwadi instead of rushing the injured to hospital or shifting the bodies that were kept in the temporary grass sheds in pouring rain,"" he said.

There was some bureaucratic bungling and delays in handing over the bodies to the relatives. The Oras civil hospital refused to accept bodies because its mortuary has a capacity of only three. The bodies were then taken by the KRC to Bambolim in Goa.

The local police had carried out a panchnama before the KRC shifted the bodies to Goa but even though the district collector waived aside the need for post-mortems there was a serious communication gap and the families were curtly told by the hospital staff to produce individual death certificates.

Eventually Sindhudurg''s guardian minister, Ajit Ghorpade, had to intervene. He sat at the Goa medical hospital till late on Tuesday to ensure that the dead were freed from administrative red-tape.
