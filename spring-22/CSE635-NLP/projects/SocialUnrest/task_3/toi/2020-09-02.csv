1,DUSU: Assembly elections on mind?,"NEW DELHI: Posters plastered in every nook and cranny, cavalcades of vehicles zooming across the city. This is nothing new when it comes to the elections of the Delhi University Studentsâ€™ Union. But there seems to be a renewed zing this year with political parties feeling the results will have a bearing on the coming assembly polls.

The Congress seems particularly hooked on to this notion with senior party leaders participating in the DUSU campaign. The National Students Union of India (NSUI) had recently called a meeting of past DUSU postholders, to devise a strategy for campaigning.

Congress councillor and DUSU president in 1994-95 Shalu Malik said: â€˜â€˜Somebody who votes for the NSUI will vote for the Congressâ€™â€™.

The victory of the Congress affiliated group in DU Teachers Association (DUTA) elections shows which way the wind is blowing, added NSUI spo-kesperson Kuntal Krishna.

A contention which is rubbished by its rival BJP-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Pari-shad, who feel the voting pattern of students depends entirely on local issues.

â€˜â€˜This is not JNU elections where students associate the group with national policies. Moreover, the anti-incumbency factor will go against NSUI,â€™â€™ ABVP state secretary Jatin Mohanty said.

Meanwhile, former office holders of DUSU have expressed concern over the â€˜â€˜blatantâ€™â€™ use of money and muscle power and the interference of political parties in the DUSU polls.

The voting pattern of a large majority of students might stun these assumptions.

Ritika Chopra, a second year student of Ramjas college voted for the DUSU polls last year. But she ticked on candidates who belonged to a hip college, or because she liked his/her name.

Ritikaâ€™s example may well highlight the level of political awareness in students.

And with barely 40 per cent of the 70,000-strong electorate voting, the disillusionment seems complete. â€˜â€˜It dosenâ€™t matter what they promise because they are all the same,â€™â€™ said Gurneet, a second year BA (pass) student of Khalsa evening college.

Many others are completely clueless about about the candidates and their parties.

2,"Free by law, yet no one to bail them out","NEW DELHI: Thirty-five-year-old Akbar Ali has been behind bars since October 2002. Booked under the Arms Act, this man is languishing in jail even though he was granted bail on January 21. He doesnâ€™t have the means to furnish the Rs 25,000 surety money.

The plight of Raju, a resident of Rohini, is similar. In jail since January 2002, he was granted bail in June last year. He needs to furnish Rs 5,000 as bail and there is no one to stand surety for him.

Tihar is bursting at its seams. Yet, there are about 350 such cases in Tihar jail, who are there just for lack of money or for want of someone to stand surety for the prisoner concerned.

The high Court had also stated that cases, where the inmate had received bail but could not be freed within three months of the order, should be reviewed after three months. In most cases the amount is reduced.

â€˜â€˜Once every two to three months we have a general survey and check the status of the prisonersâ€™ cases. If they tell us that they have been granted bail, but we donâ€™t have an order from the concerned court stating the same, we take up the case with the court,â€™â€™ said director general (prisons) Ajay Aggarwal.

Besides, about 350-400 petty offenders (those booked under charges where imprisonment is three years or less) are lodged in the jail.

About two years ago the Delhi High court passed an order stating that the jail authorities should be sent a copy of the bail order of a prisoner as and when the bail is granted. Prior to that jail authorities had to depend first on the verbal version of the inmate and then cross check from the court concerned.

In the cases of petty offenders unnecessarily languishing in jail however, the Special Courts, initiated in May 2000, have reduced their numbers to one-third.

3,State cabinet may approve Midas law today,"MUMBAI: The long-awaited law to minimise red tape, clear infrastructural proposals in a time-bound manner and introduce an independent authority for the redressal of private investorsâ€™ grievances is likely to be approved by the state cabinet on Wednesday.

Termed the Midas Actâ€”or the Maharashtra Infrastructure Development and Support Actâ€” the law is perceived to be a pathbreaking legislation that seeks to minimise procedural hurdles for infrastructural proposals made by private entrepreneurs.

The draft of the Midas Act was prepared by senior officials in the state industries department in consultation with Crisil Infrastructure Advisory and the Maharashtra Economic Development Council.

The need for such a legislation was discussed last year and former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had announced that the state would speedily enact the law to boost private investments in the infrastructure sector. After a long delay, the draft will be placed before the cabinet on Wednesday.

The cabinet will also discuss proposed amendments to the Mumbai Gram Panchayat Act, which would empower gram sabhas to recall village sarpanches involved in financial irregularities.

The proposal comes in the wake of the assurance given by chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to social worker Anna Hazare, who had fasted for nine days in August.

4,Angry farmers gherao registrar's office,"CHANDIGARH: Activists of three farmers'' union gheraoed the registrar''s office in Sector 17 on Tuesday for about three hours.

Farmers had come to the city on Monday and are holding a dharna near the Rose Garden roundabout against the ""antifarmer"" policies of the government.

Farmers are opposing the privatisation of the Punjab State Electricity Board and are demanding the free power and water supply as was available to them in the SAD regime.

Harjeet Ravi, president of the Kisan Sangharsh Committee, said the Congress had promised free power to farmers in its election manifesto, but had not fulfilled the promise.

The immediate concern of the farmers is that the minimum support price of paddy should be decided by the government by September 10 as their crop is ready and arriving in mandis.

Some of the farmers, while talking to Times News Network, said the government should buy the entire produce of the farmers, who would have to bear losses in the absence of any such policy.

Farmers from the Bharitya Kisan Union (Ekta), Punjab Kisan Sabha and Kisan Sangharsh Committee are also demanding that their bank loans be waived. They are also against the policies formed under the World Trade Organisation agreement.

Agitating farmers said Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh was only concentrating on his one-point agenda against corruption and was ignoring development projects.

They said they would protest at the Rose Garden roundabout for two more days and then decide the next course of action.

5,Ex-minister Krishna Kumar quits Cong,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former Union Minister S Krishna Kumar on Tuesday resigned from the Congress.

""I am leaving Congress because I feel that my talents are being wasted. I am sending my resignation to AICC president Sonia Gandhi,"" Kumar said.

The bureaucrat-turned politician said he was thinking of contesting the September 23 by-election from Ernakulam Lok Sabha seat as an independent candidate.

Asked about the chances of his contesting the by-poll, he said ""That is what I am planning. I will take support if it came from some reliable quarters. It will take one or two days to finalise the plans.""

Kumar had served as minister of state in Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao governments.

He plunged into politics after quitting the Indian Administrative Service in the 1980s and was elected to the Lok Sabha from Kollam thrice since 1984.

6,It’s Ganesha’s party and everyone’s invited,"MUMBAI: Lord Ganesha has swept Mumbai off its feet, blending the eternal with the ephemeral, mythology with mobile phones and bhakti with business.

Braving bomb blasts and Bipasha Bashu, Mumbaikars poured out on the streets on Sunday to welcome the cityâ€™s popular deity.

The Ganpati mandals resemble busy work stations with activists assembling the nuts and bolts of the 10-day soap-opera which mirrors the cityâ€™s angst, aspirations and cosmopolitanism.

At the Spring Mill compound Ganesh mandal near Naigaum, the cash box is controlled by Salim Mulani, a bank employee. â€œMy father has studied the Hindu scriptures,â€™â€™ says Mr Mulani with a tinge of pride. The Sahyadri Mandal at Tilak Nagar, Chembur, is headed by Peter Fernandes who pays no heed to religious distinctions.

â€œThe Almighty is above religion,â€™â€™ he declares. Software expert Kulvinder Singh Dhillon is ready to say â€˜Balle Balleâ€™ to the Bappa at Parelâ€™s Lal Maidan Ganpati utsav where Manoj Shetty is the joint secretary. â€œMy Udupi identity has taken a back seat,â€™â€™ says the 24-year-old hotel management graduate. â€œThe Ganpati festival reflects Mumbaikarsâ€™ determination to live together,â€™â€™ says mandal honcho Mahesh Savardekar.

Technology is beeping its way into the mandaps. Cell-phones and closed-circuit TVs are the order of the day. Worship at the Siddhivinayak temple is just an SMS away.

Security is, understandably, at the top of the mandalsâ€™ agenda. Apart from private guards, a relay chain of mandal activists is gearing up for a round-the-clock vigil.

Awesome idols, glittering mandaps, vibrant crowds, loud music, bright colours and the lingering fragrance of flowers and tarpaulin give the festivities a surreal feel.

The themes chosen by the various mandals are eclecticâ€”Puranas rub shoulders with politics. The Shiv Sena-controlled sarvajanik mandals showcase bomb blasts and slums to highlight the â€˜Mee Mumbaikarâ€™ campaign, the brainwave of the partyâ€™s executive president Uddhav Thackeray.

At Marol, Sena MP Sanjay Nirupamâ€™s group offers a slice of Mumbai â€”miniature replicas of the cityâ€™s landmarks. The Nare Park mandal, on the other hand, offers a sharp close-up of the flip side of Mumbaiâ€”encroached BEST stops and squalor. â€œWe want to educate Mumbaikars on how to safeguard the cityâ€™s interests,â€™â€™ says mandal secretary Mahadeo Shinde.

The Chinchpokli Ganpati recalls the role of Maharashtraâ€™s wellknown social reformers in pre-Independent India. â€œThe idea is to create an awareness about our past,â€™â€™ explains mandal president Bhalchandra Parab.

Never short on ideas, the Sahyadri Ganpati mandal of Chembur has Brahma Kumari activists posing as seven goddesses perched on plaster-of-Paris hills to give the Lord company.

Unfazed by a long drawn out legal case and several restrictions clamped by the local police, the Sahyadri mandal, which, it is learnt, has the â€˜blessingsâ€™ of dreaded don Chhota Rajan, continues to draw huge crowds.

The role of commerce in Ganeshotsav, which was sustained for decades on meagre â€˜varganiâ€™ (subscription from local residents), has undergone a change, thanks to globalisation.High-profile mandals have learnt to tap the corporate sector for advertising support.

The Ganesh Galli mandal, for instance, flaunts slides of Star TV serials and Radio Mirchi banners. A washing machine-fridge-air conditioner ad looks down from a huge entry gate at Chinchpokli. Nationalised banks and local jewellery shops continue to support the mandals for old timeâ€™s sake.

â€œEager to target the buyersâ€™ market, the corporate sector has started funding big Ganpati mandals which attract a heavy turnout of devotees,â€™â€™ says vicepresident of the Ganesh Galli mandal Gurunath Korgaonkar.

7,Woman claiming to be DC arrested,"LUDHIANA: Asha Dhingra, a resident of Delhi, was arrested on a charge of impersonation, here, on Tuesday.

Asha, who introduced herself as the deputy commissioner of Shimla in Himachal Pradesh, had gone to the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Ludhiana to ask for a vehicle claiming that her ""official"" car had broken down.

The DC who was busy making last-minute arrangements for the President''s visit referred her to the office of ADC Rahul Bhandari who said that he would look into her problem soon.

Asha became nervous when she realised that DSP Snehdeep Sharma had become suspicious of her intentions and tried to make a getaway.

She was, however, arrested. A case has been registered.

8,Top cop's car flouts law on city flyover,"KOLKATA: After the Malda DIGâ€™s official vehicle, it was the turn of an IGâ€™s official car to break rules on Monday morning. The vehicle, flashing red lights, rode at breakneck speed along the wrong flank of the AJC Bose Road flyover.

It was a miracle it did not ram into another car coming from the opposite end. On Friday, a redlight flashing vehicle broke the one-way rule on Park Street. Police commissioner Sujay Chakraborty happened to spot it and order prosecution of the car, belonging to DIG Gaurav Dutt.

On Monday morning, police claimed they were not sure which senior officer was in the car, but a constable on duty had jotted down its number (3291). They said they were trying to track down the vehicle bearing a two-star insignia. â€œThe offending vehicle will be prosecuted,â€� DC (traffic) M.K. Singh said. The constable who reported the matter told his superiors that the vehicle took the northern flank to approach the SSKM Hospital end instead of the southern flank.

Then again it took a wrong turn towards Hospital Road, ostensibly heading towards Bhavani Bhavan. Whether the cops actually book this vehicle is yet to be seen, but at least in the other case they are sending a â€˜citation letterâ€™ or summons to Dutt. The DIG is being told that his driver had broken rules. Dutt would be told that his driver could not produce the necessary papers when asked.

He is also being intimated that the driver is being fined and cautioned against such acts in future, which might attract harsher penalties. Singh rebuffed suggestions that police soft-pedal prosecution against top cops breaking traffic laws. â€œThat we are prosecuting in such cases proves otherwise,â€� he said.

9,Asim promises Puja gift to potato farmers,"KOLKATA: Over 74,000 potato farmers who lost their entire crop to hailstorms in March 2002, will receive a compensation package of Rs 38.64 crore before the pujas, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Tuesday.

Dasgupta who announced the release of the state governmentâ€™s share of Rs 16. 54 crores during the day, said the Centre was expected to pay an equal amount soon. â€œThe General Insurance Corporation is also due to pay an additional Rs 5.5 crore to the farmersâ€™ account,â€� he said.

State food and civil supplies minister Naren De and library minister Nemai Mal added that the move would benefit 74,158 farmers who had lost potato cultivated over 22,000 hectare land.

â€œNearly 99 per cent of those who will get some relief as a result of this insurance payment, are small and marginal farmers. This is the first time that farmers in West Bengal are receiving insurance payment. It is also the largest compensation package offered to farmers in recent years,â€� Dasgupta said.

10,Rudy shoots down open sky policy,"HYDERABAD: Virtually turning down Chandrababu Naidu''s plea, Union civil aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy has asserted that the open sky policy was not feasible.

""This is not possible due to various reasons including financial loss, commercial interests and aviation policies of foreign countries. But, efforts are being made to create hubs for trans-Atlantic flights within the country"", he said.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Rudy said the Centre has constituted Naresh Chandra Committee which would look into all aspects of civil aviation including taxation, fuel prices, level playing field etc.

The committee is likely to submit its report by October this year and would be placed before the Cabinet for approval.

The Union minister favoured creation of better infrastructure to conform with global standards.

""India with the massive aviation infrastructure cannot lag behind with any developed country and there is an imperative need to upgrade its infrastructure and facilities,"" he added.

When asked about his talks with Naidu, Rudy appreciated the AP chief minister''s demand for an open sky policy to achieve all round development of the state''s economy, but open sky policy was not feasible.

11,Fix interim fee structure: HC to govt,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday criticised the state government for not setting up a committee to approve the fees to be charged by private unaided engineering and medical colleges.

The court asked the government to appoint the committee immediately. A division bench of Justice A.P. Shah and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud also expressed concern at the steep hike of 150 per cent in fees proposed by private professional colleges for 2003-04.

The HC had on August 23 directed the government to set up the committee within a week. Special government counsel Ashutosh Kumbhakoni on Tuesday said the committee would be appointed within a day.

Students seeking admissions to private colleges would have to shell out the exorbitant fees proposed by the colleges for this year. The state has ruled out fixing an interim fee structure till the committee begins functioning.

Medical colleges, which till last year charged an annual fees of Rs 1.26 lakhs, have proposed fee structures in the range of Rs 3.15 lakhs to Rs 3.80 lakhs. So far, eight medical colleges have submitted their fee proposals to the HC. Dental colleges have proposed annual fees in the range of Rs two lakhs and Rs 2.5 lakhs.

Similarly, private engineering colleges have submitted their proposals to the Directorate of Technical Education increasing the annual fees from Rs 15,000 to range between Rs 32,000 and Rs 65,000.

Conceding that the process of approving fees of hundreds of colleges will take ``considerable time'', joint director for higher education A.D. Sawant said, the colleges will have to adjust the excess fees next year.

State officials said that in addition to scrutinising the fee structures of 137 private engineering and 30 private medical colleges, the committee would also approve the fees of private undergraduate colleges and management institutes. After the October 2002 Supreme Court order all fees were to be approved by the state-appointed Educational Institutions Regulatory Authority (EIRA), which has now been dissolved.

The HC observed that approval of fees should be based on the infrastructure and other facilities provided by the colleges. It said that unjustified high fees could deprive meritorious students belonging to the middle class of higher education.

The judges also directed the government to look at providing financial assistance to deserving students in addition to subsidising education for economically weaker students. This, they said, could be done in the form of granting soft loans with minimal interest rates.

12,Cabinet to clear law to speed infrastructure projects,"MUMBAI: The long-awaited proposed law to minimise red-tape, time-bound clearance of infrastructure proposals and setting up of an independent authority for redressal of private investors is likely to be cleared by the state cabinet on Wednesday.

Termed MIDAS or the Maharashtra Infrastructure Development and Support Act, (MIDAS) it is perceived to be a path-breaking legislation which seeks to minimise the procedural hurdles in infrastructure proposals taken by private entrepreneurs.

The draft of MIDAS was prepared by senior officials in the state industries department in consultation with Crisil Infrastructure Advisory and the Maharashtra Economic Development Council (MEDC).

The need for such a legislation was discussed last year and former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had announced that the state would speedily enact the law to boost private investments in the infrastructure sector.

After a long delay the proposed act will be presented before the state cabinet which will meet on Wednesday.

The cabinet will also discuss the amendments to be carried out in the Mumbai Gram Panchayat Act so as to empower the gram sabhas with right to recall the village sarpanch involved in financial irregularities.

The move comes in the wake of the assurance given by chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to social worker Anna Hazare who had sat on a 9-day fast on August 9.

Among the other demand made by Mr Hazare he had sought that the gram sabha, the primary unit in panchayat raj democracy, should have the powers to recall the village sarpanch if his performance is not satisfactory.

Though Mr Shinde was initially hesitant to agree to this demand, he conceded later and said that the law to empower the gram sabha''s would be enacted shortly.

13,Muslims protest against arrests,"AHMEDABAD: The â€˜self-imposedâ€™ bandh provoked by the recent arrests of Muslims in the Akshardham case, was complete in most Muslimdominated localities of Ahmedabad on Tuesday.

Shops, commercial establishments and offices in areas like Dariapur, Shahpur, Shah-e-Alam and Juhapura remained closed to protest against police atrocities. No untoward incident was reported The bandh call was not given officially by any political, religious or voluntary outfit, instead an anonymous pamphlet which talked about police and state governmentâ€™s partisan stance towards the Muslims circulated on the eve of the bandh, did the job.

The pamphlet said, â€œMuslims of Gujarat and especially those staying in Ahmedabad are being defamed by false allegations and arrests. If we donâ€™t protest now, then the power-hungry people who are orchestrating this anti-Muslim policing,would succeed in turning Gujarat into a strifetorn zone like Kashmir.â€�

â€œClergies and leaders of our community along with commoners are being indicted for any untoward incident that occurs in India. â€˜Kya Musalman hona atankwad hai?â€™ (Is being a Muslim an act of terrorism?),â€� the note questioned.

Initially, the bandh was supposed to be limited to Dariapur and Shahpur from where the city crime branch made most of the arrests, but eventually it spread to other areas.

The protest also extended to the arrests in the cases of the killing of ex-state home minister Haren Pandya and the tiffin blasts aboard AMTS buses where the accused were booked under Pota.

In Jamalpur, Jamila (5) played with a friend, on the footpath. On weekdays this area is a choc-a-bloc with hawkers selling vegetables, flowers and other shops drawing customers from all parts of the city.

The roads wore a deserted look as shops lining the usually busy Teen Darwaja area downed shutters. Mohammad Rahim who ekes out a living by duplicating keys and fixing locks was among the few who was visible on the vacant roads. â€œI have come all the way from Sarkhej and now I will also return since business is bad.â€�

Residential areas and commercial zones of Juhapura too echoed the protest bandh. However, Addl commissioner of police (headquarters) who is also holding temporary charge of the areas falling under sector II, K D Patadia, said: â€œAll pre-emptive measures like bandobast and increased patrolling had been taken. People went about their business as usual in most parts of the city.â€�

In the evening a small group of women who tried to take out a protest rally from the Limdi Chowk of super-sensitive Dariapur were prevented by the police. DCP (Zone IV) S K Gadhvi said: â€œWe reasoned with the womenfolk that they would be violating the police commissionerâ€™s prohibitory orders on public assembly or demonstration for any such cause. The demonstrators then dispersed on their own.â€�

Mukhtar Mohammad, members of the peace committee at Dariapur said:â€œWhy is Pota being used only against Muslims. People who used provide basic amenities like hospital and help riot-hit residents by running relief camps are being abused by the city police.They are being termed as criminals by the city crime branch without any corroborative evidence.â€�

The crime branch had arrested five persons from Dariapur and Shahpur of which two are clerics, in the Akshardham case, last week.

14,Gang of car-pinchers busted in city,"HYDERABAD: Some car thieves were caught in the act at Ramkote on Sunday. They were trying to prise open the door of a car when a team of policemen pounced on them.

Investigations later revealed that the gang has had quite a track record.

Active in many parts of the city, the team has thus far pinched cars worth Rs 57 lakh.

G Vishnu Vardhan Reddy of Mahabubnagar, Kondala Nageshwar Reddy of Kurnool and Velga Veeraiah Chowdhary of Prakasam had come together to make quick millions by stealing cars, additional commissioner of police A K Khan said.

The members of the gang have confessed to having pinched 12 cars, four motorcycles. Not just that.

They also diversified into break-ins. They staged two such and these ventures yielded them a rich booty.

As part of their diversification plans, they also tried their hand at stealing computers. And, they made a killing by selling 20 computers and two laptops they stole recently.

Some of the stolen cars they stole, others they used to transport hooch to Karnataka. Three such stolen vehicles have been impounded by the state excise department.

The thefts were committed in the police station limits of Langar Houz, Malakpet, S R Nagar, Tukaramgate, Bowenpally, Saroornagar and R K Puram.

The gang also committed a few thefts in Vijayawada, Kurnool and Kadapa.

According to a senior police officer, the thieves usually prowled around crowded places such as busy shopping malls to steal vehicles parked outside.

The criminals would first identify the vehicle owner as he parks the vehicle. Soon as the man goes inside the buuilding, the thieves would get to work.

Two of them would stand away from the vehicle and keep a lookout for the vehicle owner even as a third man would pick the lock of the vehicle and steal it.

And should the owner return in a hurry the duo who are on the lookout would engage him in a conversation away from the vehicle or pick a fight with him to divert attention.

15,What injustice? Petition not convincing,"PATNA: Here follows a petition by a lecturer in English to governor M Rama Jois: ""I come to knows that Prof Rama Shray Yadav Hon''ble Vice Chancellor of T.M. Bhagalpur University is man of Justice and kind hearted who listens the sufferers of the university and try to solve the problem if judgmin & possible.

once again I came to Bhagalpur and requested the present Vice-Chancellor begging a bit of mercy for my case. Finally, I thanked God and the Hon''ble TBU Vice-Chancellor who took fairly interest and I got revaluated marks. ""Thus, I humbly would like you to say that after a great Tapasya I have got the justice. So please do not consider it as a irregularities. Infact, in my case, one irregularity of the university has been corrected which was unjustified from long time.

""Please issue a press release in favours of this case and write to the concernings so I may feel a sense relief and continue my remaining service. Otherwise I may be compelled to knock the door of Hon''ble High Court if I lost my service on such a ground. soliciting your favourable response."" Unmoved by the threat of litigation, the Raj Bhavan on Tuesday did issue a press release which also contained extracts from the English lecturer, Anil Kumar Tiwari''s petition to him.

And yes, the press release said the governor-cum- chancellor of universities has directed Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University to cancel the ''high-second-class-MA-in-English marksheet'' issued to Tiwari. Tiwari''s is not a run-of-the-mill story of a student doing MA in English and subsequently getting a lecturer''s job. Tiwari in fact wrote the post-graduate examination in 1988. He was issued a mark sheet in 1990, according to which he passed the exam in third class. Not one, two, three... but twelve years later -- in April 2003, to be precise, Tiwari made a representation to the university, reminding it that he had submitted an application for re-evaluation of the answersheets of three papers in 1991. But only two papers were re-evaluated after which he was given additional 15 marks.

The ""aggrieved"" alumnus pleaded that paper III, which had not been re-evaluated, be also re-evaluated now. While processing Tiwari''s petition, the controller of examinations put it on record that Tiwari''s paper II answerbook was not available and a fresh examination in the paper may be held. Vice chancellor Ramashray Yadav gave his nod and a sum of Rs 3,000 was collected from Tiwari as examination fee. The examination for the paper was held and a final marksheet issued: 55 per cent in aggregate. The university took only 19 days'' time to process Tiwari''s application and redress his grievances.

Incidentally, he had also written that if he gets 55 per cent marks, he could save his job. But chancellor M Rama Jois quoted rules to rule that only the chancellor can give permission to a candidate having passed a PG examination to improve his performance by re-writing up to three papers and that too only in the immediate next examination. ""It is sad that neither Sri Tiwari nor the VC realised that anything which is given or acquired contrary to law, might give temporary benefit or advantage, but ultimately the beneficiaries of such illegality are sure to suffer,"" remarked governor Rama Jois.

The governor stumbled upon Tiwari''s case while going through the allegations made in a representation against the TMBU VC by Shiksha Bachav Nagrik Manch. The parties concerned were issued show-cause notices and it was from Tiwari''s reply to the notice that the Raj Bhavan extracted the above-mentioned paragraphs. ""The English is that of Tiwari... (it) exposes his knowledge...,"" the chancellor said.

16,Four farmers end lives across state,"BANGALORE: Dejection over crop loss and mounting debts drove four farmers to suicide in different parts of the state in the last two days, while a farmer tried to immolate self in Kolar district.

The suicide by Karibasava of Muddapur village in Bellary district came to light on Monday. Reason: mounting debts and inability to repay it.

He had borrowed Rs 1.5 lakh from various sources for pumpsets, but could not repay as the yield was low. As pressure from lenders mounted, he ended his life by consuming pesticide on Sunday.

In Haveri district, a farmer committed suicide by consuming pesticide on Saturday as crops in his five acres of land had withered.

The farmer, identified as Shekhanagouda Neeralagi (45), was from Kalvekallappur village of Hanagal taluk.

Frustrated over her husbandâ€™s debts, a farmerâ€™s wife ended life by hanging herself at Badavanadinne in Mudigere taluk on Sunday.

Thangamma (65), wife of Venkategowda, took this step as her husband could not repay the loan he had taken from a co-operative society.

Gangadhar (43), a farmer from Karle village of Hassan, committed suicide by consuming poison on Monday. He had four acres of dry land and borrowed Rs 1 lakh from a finance company. He took this step due to the crop loss and mounting debts, family sources said.

In Kolar district, a farmer â€” upset over the monsoon failure â€” tried to immolate self at Tamareddyhalli in Mulbagal taluk on Monday. It is learnt Narayana Reddy (35), who owned 4 acres of land, was upset over crop failure and financial worries. He doused himself with kerosene and set himself ablaze. Reddy was brought to Victoria Hospital, Bangalore, where he was recovering.

Former PM H.D. Deve Gowda has advised farmers to desist from committing suicide. Speaking at a function in Bangalore, he promised to work with the government to help them.

17,Cops frown as Ganesha goes political,"VADODARA: Ganesha is going political in Vadodara, with statues of Narendra Modi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, General Musharraf and Sonia Gandhi sharing the spotlight in the pandals with the elephant-headed God.

But in one case, Musharraf â€™s statue had to undergo cosmetic changes on Monday night on the orders of the police, who found the depiction of the General â€œobjectionableâ€�.

Fearing a communal flare-up, the police asked organisers to remove a placard on the statue with the word â€˜Terroristâ€™ printed on it and also change the army outfit that made the statueâ€™s identity obvious.

The pandal in Bajwada depicted Lord Ganesh holding Musharraf by the neck, even as Modi and Vajpayee looked on. And the walls of the pandal had slogans like â€˜Aatankvaadiyon ka sardar Musharraf nu naash karshe Shri Ganeshâ€™. â€œThe police objected to the banner and also asked us to change Musharraf â€™s costume.

But due to practical difficulties, we simply decided to label the statue a terrorist,â€� said Shonak Tailor, an organiser.

Commissioner of police Sudhir Sinha said that it was wrong to depict the leader of a state in a distasteful manner. â€œThe country has diplomatic relations with Pakistan,â€� Sinha said.

But political messages in the Ganesh Utsav this year are aplenty. If Modi makes a guest appearance in a wedding sequence at one of the pandals, he is sharing the dais with Vajpayee in another. At a traffic island near Sursagar lake, Ganesha descends to give â€˜darshanâ€™ to Modi amidst the chanting of the â€˜Ganesha Stotraâ€™.

Also adorning the colourful pandals are monuments like Akshardham. Artistes from Mumbai were invited to make a giant replica of Akshardham at a pandal at Bagikhana.

Even amidst the political flavour and religious fervour, one cannot miss the pandals that have a message of communal harmony. Limdifalkia Mitra Mandali on Kalupur road has depicted Ganesha as Shirdiâ€™s Sai Baba with messages like â€˜Sabka malik ek haiâ€™.

Ahmedabadâ€™s sculptors say they had received orders to create sculptures of politicians, but could not take up the orders fearing police harassment. â€œWe had thought about doing tableau with a political theme. However, post riots, the police have prohibited us from working on displays that could inflame passions,â€� said Moreshwar Pitade, a sculptor.

19,Anti-socials back for LU polls,"LUCKNOW: Common student of the Lucknow University fears that campus will once again will be afflicted by the ""professional"" student leaders after state government''s decision to lift the age bar of 25 years for contesting students union election.

They also feel that ""academic standards"" of the student leaders and student polity will also fall as the restriction on students failing or dropping a year in a class has also been lifted in the amendments announced by the state government in the 2000 students union reforms.

And now when there are 60 per cent girls in comparison to boys enrolled in various courses of LU, the prime concern of the students is law and order of the campus.

The fear of students appears to be genuine in the light of the facts that barring on one occasion in 2000-01, the last ten presidents of the LU students union (LUSU) were between the age group of 35-40. Students say that at this age student leaders appear more like ""daddies"" rather than students. Furthermore, most of these student leaders were ""professionals"" and stay put in the university, taking admissions in various courses, dropping years, only to contest elections.

""They use LUSU as a launching pad for political career,"" said a student adding that LUSU elections were mere a farce in the name of democratic set-up. Sample this: Ninety per cent of the over Rs 10-12 lakhs collected under the students union fund, by charging Rs 60 each per student, was spent on organising worthless symposiums and felicitation ceremonies, in which political leaders were called as chief guest by these leader to gain their proximity.

Political parties used to openly sponsor candidates for their vested interest as these student leaders used to provide them with the ""muscle power"" and strength for assembly and parliamentary elections.

Not-surprisingly, between 1990-2000, LUSU twice felicitated SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav with honorary membership of students union, besides BSP chief Mayawati on one occasion.

Earlier, in 50s and 60s and even in 80s Prime Ministers like J L Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, noted educationists, Chief of Army Staff, freedom fighters like Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, were conferred with this honour.

Seeing such a blatant misuse of student polity election reforms were brought in 2000, following hectic debates and popular demand of the students. The general student had lost interest in the union elections as turnout during last ten elections was only between 15-20 per cent. Participation of girls was merely 3-5 per cent.

There have been cases when these student leaders have kept themselves deliberately in LU for over 10-15 years only to fight elections. Since there is no restrictions on number of attempts for contesting a post, two student leaders, both now prominent SP leaders, fought 4-6 elections for presidentships before finally they were elected.

A senior professor pointed out that the elections had mainly became an affair of hostel residents, who represent only 15 per cent of the total student strength in LU. Elections had also reduced to ""war for supremacy"", leading to bloodshed and violence among rival groups.

Student leaders used to behave like mafia dons, giving shelter to rowdy elements, both with cash and kind. Big money was also involved as most student leaders had four wheelers with fancy mobiles and used to spend over Rs 5 lakh in election for president, collected from extortion and contract business.

Money was squandered to assemble battery of cars, distribution of expensive cards and election canvassing material, inviting political leaders for campaign, wanton display of firearms, liquor among other things to catch the fancy of the students.

20,Bareilly clashes: CM warns officials of laxity,"LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Wednesday morning warned the top administrative and police officials in the state that any laxity on their part which leads to any law and order crises would attract not only a mere transfer but also departmental action and ""even more"".

The CM was reacting to the communal flare-up in Bareilly following the murder of a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator which resulted in stabbing and subsequent rioting.

The laxity in the part of the senior district officials and the police choosing to stand as a mute spectator for at least 10 hours before a top level team headed by Additional Director General (ADG) Law and Order Vikram Singh was flown in from the state capital in an aircraft to take control of the situation.

Though Bareilly was limping back to normal, the CM took a specific note of the careless attitude of the Bareilly officials and transferred them.

Meanwhile, the situation in Bareilly was described as completely under control as the family members of the BJP corporator were taken to the cremation ground in heavy police escort to perform the ""Phool Chugna"" ceremony - a part of the last rites, on Wednesday morning.

Sources in the state administration said that the senior officials were monitoring the situation and would announce on lifting the curfew in seven localities of the two police circles by Wednesday evening.

21,J&K militancy may force govt to switch off cells,"SRINAGAR: The recently launched mobile services in the Kashmir valley may get jeopardised due to the recent spurt in militancy in Jammu and Kashmir and attacks on security forces. They point towards a strong presence of militants in Srinagar city.

Even though the chief general manager of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), Arun Kumar, denied having received any communique from the home ministry instructing him to stop the service, a local newspaper said BNSL authorities had been asked by the Union home ministry to put the services on hold â€œtill further orders.â€™â€™

The decision of the Union home ministry headed by Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani is said to have come after the revelation by the Delhi police that Kashmiri militants had placed a Rs 50 lakh order for mobile phone instruments in New Delhi, according to a local newspaper.

After the arrest of two persons (who the Delhi police believes wereJaish-e-Mohammad militants) from the capital two days ago, the police says the group was planning to purchase mobile phone instruments worth Rs 50 lakhs. The instruments, the police say, were supposed to be used by Kashmiri militants.

Alarmed by the finding, the Centre is said to have decided not to go ahead with the launch of the services in the state.

The BSNL has issued SIM cards to all major heads of departments, including police officers and senior officers of security agencies.

The general manager of BSNL, G.M. Marshall, confirmed that the computerised draw of lots for mobile connections scheduled to be held on September 4 had been postponed â€œindefinitelyâ€™â€™ although he denied having knowledge of any home ministry communique.

The draw of lots for Srinagar and Jammu was initially slated for September 2. BSNL has received about 17,000 applications from Srinagar and 22,000 from Jammu region.

22,HRD minister's favourite subject turning to dust,"KOLKATA: Rare sanskrit manuscripts, in the library of the 175-year-old Sanskrit College (the HRD ministerâ€™s favourite subject), from the 16th century are turning to dust due to the lack of restoration.

Apart from a Rs 2,70,000 grant, the Centre has done precious little to safeguard these national treasures. The West Bengal government has allotted an additional Rs 90,000 towards restoration. According to experts, the consolidated amount is frugal, considering the mammoth task on hand.

""The Centre has promised us more funds. We have over 22,000 rare manuscripts from the 16th, 17th and 18th century. Many of them are crumbling and turning to dust. There is immediate need to restore the manuscripts to their original form,"" said senior librarian of Sanskrit College, Subhas Chandra Chakraborty.

In July the state government set up an advisory committee to look into the details of restoration. The committee met for the first time on Wednesday to discuss basic issues like the quantum of funds required, expertise to be sought, modes of restoration and filling up of vacancies.

The meeting will also be attended by experts from the state archives, the Indian Museum and the National Library.

""Issues relating to repair and restoration, disinfection and cleaning and setting up of a fumigation chamber will be discussed. Some manuscripts may also have to be laminated. It is also essential to air-condition the library to prevent damage to the restored manuscripts. If funds are made available, the entire process should be completed in 3 to 4 years,"" Chakraborty said.

There were 30 employees attached to the library till around a decade ago. Today, there are only 15 people in charge of affairs.

""There are over 2,00,000 books in the library. It is the best of its kind in the eastern region. Unfortunately, we donâ€™t have the necessary infrastructure to attract a large number of research scholars and students. There is need to computerise the library and provide other necessary features,"" said Chakraborty.

23,"Scan cell phone applications properly, govt tells BSNL","NEW DELHI: Home Ministry officials admit that they have raised several questions about launching mobile services in Jammu and Kashmir and have asked BSNL to ""carefully scrutinise"" the applications.

However, officials deny that any communique has been sent to the state government or to BSNL in this regard. At the same time, officials maintain that indefinite postponement of computerised draw of lots of applications slated on September 4 ""might have taken place because of home ministry''s reservations.""

A senior official said, ""The spurt of terrorist activities in the valley would continue for some more time. Moreover, there are intelligence inputs that terrorist organisations have applied for mobile connection. There is no way out but to scrutinise the applications and carry out due-diligence.""

Without giving any figures he says that after the ban on cellphones in the valley, terrorist activities have come down. ""Decision to launch mobile phone service would be exploited by terrorist groups and we do not want to take any chance,"" he says.

Based on intelligence reports, official claims that Gazi Baba''s killing would be avenged by militant groups by indulging in ""cold-blooded acts.""

24,Cognizant increasing its headcount at 100 per week,"CHENNAI: Call it optimism or banking on the return of the feel good factor, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) is now increasing its headcount at aggressive rate of 100 per week.

Going at this rate, CTS is expecting to end the year with a total of 8,500 to 9,000 people on its rolls. As of June''03 quarter, CTS had 6700 employees. In the last two months it has added 500 and increased the total to 7200. The comany is following a 50:50 ratio of fresh and lateral talent in its recruitment programme.

Speaking at Smith Barney Citigroup Technology Conference in New York, (transcripts of which are available at CTS website), Mr Kumar Mahadeva, chairman and CEO, Cognizant said ""Cognizant is growing faster that we an-ticipated. We now expect to exceed our earlier guidance of at least $354 mil-lion for the calendar year 2003.""

""We are continuing to invest heavily in Practice Leaders, Client Partners (who have more of a management consulting or Big 5 profile) and in sales and marketing. We tend to over invest in these areas but this is a good reason for clients to be extremely happy with our performance,"" he said.

The company has invested about $40 million in infrastructure in India. It finished the first phase of construction of 600,000 sq. ft. space to house 6000 people in India.

Commenting on BPO, he said ""infrastructure outsourcing is seeing some strong growth and there has also been some growth in BPO. Cognizant has been pretty cautious with BPO as a lot of work is still commoditized and not very profitable"".

He added ""Our business has demonstrated steady and consistent operating margins. We target an operating margin of 19-20 percent and we re-invest anything above 20 percent back into our business. We believe that this is also one of the reasons why we are growing faster than our peers as the investment we have made in Client Partners and Industry Experts helps clients to grow faster.""

The company has also announced that it''s pricing has been stable and is moving up slightly on new deals. It''s average pricing has been flat over the last eight quarters or so.

25,Passive smoking increases heart disease,"LONDON: Being exposed to even small amounts of second-hand smoke is as bad for the heart as active smoking, concludes a new Greek study of 847 heart patients and 1,078 healthy people.

Dr. Demosthenes Panagiotakos and his colleagues from the University of Athens, Greece, asked the participants if they were exposed to second-hand smoke for more than 30 minutes each day.

Some 86 per cent of heart patients said they were exposed to second-hand smoke as compared to 56 per cent of healthy volunteers.

Among non-smokers, heart patients were almost 50 per cent more likely to be regularly exposed to second-hand smoke.

It was also found that people who were exposed to second-hand smoke were 15 per cent more likely to develop heart disease.

That risk doubled if they were exposed for up to 30 years.

""Even a short exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of developing acute coronary syndromes,"" BBC quoted Panagiotakos as saying at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Vienna, Austria, recently.

""The only safe way to protect non-smokers from exposure to cigarette smoke is to eliminate this health hazard from public places and workplaces, as well as from the home. A ban on smoking in workplaces might be an effective way to reduce exposure to second-hand smoke,"" he added.",LONDON
26,Three more farmers commit suicide,"MYSORE: Sonia Gandhi''s visit to Suttur on Wednesday to launch the health scheme did not prevent Mahadevnaik burdened with debts and crop failures from committing suicide.

28,Cong may not join Mulayam govt,"NEW DELHI: The newly installed Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government in UP has reconciled to the fact that the Congress party will only lend outside support instead of sharing power with it.

The Congress, it is learnt, has not conveyed its final view to Mulayam but there are indications are that the Congress is wary of joining his government. Now that Mulayam is to prove his majority only on September 8, the Congress is not in a rush to announce its decision. The official position, as comunicated to the Samajwadi Party, is that the Congress leaders are still discussing the issue.

The party''s central leadership is under tremendous pressure from its UP legislators to join the government. Having been out of power for over a decade, the state Congress MLAs are arguing that the cadres would get activated if the party joins the government.

In fact, the cabinet expansion in UP has been put off till after September 8 essentially to give the Congress sufficient time to take a final view.

On its part, Mulayam would have liked the Congress to join the government as that would lend greater stability to the new dispensation. ""It definitely helps if a party has a stake in the government,"" said a leader of the ruling UP combine.

However, Mulayam and other allies are not unduly worried if the Congress decides to sit it out. Coalition leaders maintained that having committed its support to the new secular front, the Congress will be obliged to stay the course. Since it cannot opt out of this commitment, the Congress is also keen on keeping the BSP in good humour. ""By staying out of the government, the Congress is reassuring the BSP that it is open to an electoral understanding with it in the future,"" explained a coalition leader.

The SP and its other partners believe the Congress will not be in any hurry to enter into any arrangement with the BSP. But, as a fist step, it will hope to have an understanding with Mayawati in the coming assembly polls in four states. This, it was stated, will ensure that the BSP turns its ire at the BJP while going soft on the Congress.

On the flip side, coalition leaders said, the Congress mood to stay out of the government has helped stem the exodus of legislators from the BSP ranks. Sources said while 13 BSP legislators had openly support the Mulayam government, the SP is still struggling to woo 23 more BSP MLAs required to get around the anti-defection law.

""After the first flush, many BSP legislators are wondering if it is worth crossing over. They believe that in case of a future tie-up with the Congress, the BSP will remain a party in the reckoning,"" it was stated.

30,Cash incentive better than mid-day meals: Vijay Goel,"NEW DELHI: Giving children a cash incentive to attend school rather than the mid-day meal can be an alternate step to draw in more students. The idea was put forward by Chandni Chowk MP and Union minister of state Vijay Goel, who has demanded the discontinuation of the mid-day meal.

''''The Haryana government gives a cash incentive of Rs 1 per student. This might be better as it would eliminate the possibility of giving meals of inferior quality,'''' Goel said. Recently 25 children had fallen ill in Wazirabad after they were served the mid-day meal by Shoshit Samaj, an NGO.

The NGO is still supplying mid-day meals to about 30 schools.

The MCD reportedly spends Rs 2 per meal per day, costing Rs 2 crore per month. The MCD was earlier distributing finger foods like biscuits to students. The NGOs were involved after the Supreme Court ordered the MCD to serve cooked meals.

Goel claimed that many parents had complained to him about the unhygienic quality of the food when he had visited schools.

Another factor, said Goel was the huge amount of time wasted due to distribution of the meals. '''' A student goes to school for barely four to five hours, of these one-and-a-half hours are wasted in distributing the meal,'''' he added. The problem is compounded by the fact that many schools do not have drinking water facility.

Goel has demanded that the MCD should set up a committee to examine the mid-day meal issue. If distributing cooked meals to children is not possible then the MCD should report the fact to the Supreme Court, he added.

Goel has been trying to improve the conditions of the schools under the ''school sudhar yojana''. Two schools of Gali Bandook wali and Gali Bansi Koyle Wali have already been ''''transformed''''.

31,Advani election proposal is part of BJP's psyops against Cong,"NEW DELHI: Just how serious is the move to synchronise polls for the Lok Sabha, scheduled for the later half of 2004, and four state assemblies due for elections later this year?

Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s stated goals of reducing the electoral push-pull on governance makes the proposal rational and desirable, but it does not quite square itself with the parliamentary form where governments can remain only till they retain a majority in their respective House.

In this light, Advani''s musings are more part of the BJP''s psychological operations (psyops in military parlance) against its principal adversary, the Congress party, rather than a serious suggestion for electoral reform. Predictably Advani''s statement has hogged the headlines, while the Congress readiness to take up the BJP challenge has been buried in the inside pages of newspapers, if it has been carried at all.

All major political formations, particularly the BJP and the Congress, have to shape a strategy that will yield dividends in the assembly elections to Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Delhi scheduled in November this year, as well as the jackpot of the 2004 general elections to the Lok Sabha.

The BJP has kicked off the effort with its tried and tested Ram Mandir formula. The RSS, its front organisations like the VHP, have kept up a steady drum-beat calling for the Ram Mandir construction to begin, if necessary through legislation in Parliament. The funeral of Ramchandra Paramhans provided a platform to show just how united all shades of Sangh Parivar opinion were on this subject. Since the four state assemblies are in the so-called cow belt, there are expectations that a Ram Mandir wave, if it materialises in the coming months, will sweep away the Congress.

Traditionally, Lok Sabha polls focus on so-called national issues such as national leadership and security and political stability, while state assembly elections are over local and development issues. By synchronising elections, the BJP hopes to gain because it hopes to cash in on voter perception that it is tough on security issues and has a more coherent leadership and a viable national coalition.

Synchronised elections before 1971 were possible because the Congress had massive majorities in all the state assemblies and Parliament. The situation today is very different. Electors have stubbornly refused to give a majority to any one political formation since the 1984 general elections and in states there are strong state-level formations such as the TDP, AIADMK or the BSP.

The only way Advani''s stated goals can be achieved is not by tinkering with the present system, but a switch-over to the Presidential or American system. But as the debate over the Constitutional Review Commission has shown, too many vested interests have grown around the old system to give any viable alternative a chance.

32,DUSU elections: Free flow of freebies,"NEW DELHI: Roadshows, DJs, fresher parties, movies, audio cassettes ... freebies are raining in on Delhi University students. Rival student groups vie for a place in the hearts of DU students as the September 5 DU poll draws nearer.

The big DUSU poll binge has more to it â€” cavalcades of vehicles zooming across the city, activists armed with latest mobile phones and multi-coloured posters and banners plastered all over. And since this year''s polls are being given special significance with assembly polls round the corner, the moolah flows over like never before.

Going by the code of conduct of Delhi University, election expenses should not exceed Rs 10,000 per candidate; and not more than two vehicles should be used by each candidate for canvassing. But even by conservative estimates, the National Students Union of India (NSUI) and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) are spending anywhere between Rs 20 to 30 lakh for DUSU elections.

Some students of Rajdhani College, reportedly, got to see a movie show recently as part of a student group''s campaign to win them over. In Ram Lal Anand and Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma college, audio cassettes of ''Koi Mil Gaya'' were distributed.

Officially, NSUI claims to be spending only Rs 50,000. ''''We are concentrating on an interactive campaign,'''' said NSUI spokesperson Kuntal Krishna.

ABVP spends Rs 2 to 2.5 lakh claims Delhi state secretary Jatin Mohanty.

A multi-coloured poster costs around Rs 5 and a party needs at least 5,000 if it wants to cover all the 55 colleges, with over one lakh students affiliated to the DUSU in different parts of the city, says a DUSU veteran.

Then, there are thousands of pamphlets (one coloured pamphlet costs around 75 paise), stickers, and other paraphernalia. Workers have to be given cell phones, food, and sometimes even booze and money, he adds.
