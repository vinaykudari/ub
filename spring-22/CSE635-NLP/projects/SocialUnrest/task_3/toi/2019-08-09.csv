0,Exit policy for servicemen soon,"NEW DELHI: An ""exit policy"" the defence ministry is finalising for officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force will include an ""attractive"" monetary package as well as assistance in locating an alternative career.

This forms part of the ongoing exercise to finalise proposals for ""cadre restructuring"" in the armed forces by a committee headed by a secretary- level officer, Ajai Vikram Singh, and including representatives from all the three Services.

Senior defence officers say the primary aim of the entire exercise, which is in the final stages now, is to arrest the ""ageing profile"" of the armed forces by lowering the age of the commanders of operational units. In the Army, for instance, an officer now assumes the command of a battalion at the age of 41-42 and a brigade at 50-51. ""We want to bring this down by four to five years so that officers become battalion commanders by 37 and brigade commanders by 45...It is a functional requirement of the armed forces,"" said an officer.

The proposals will be implemented gradually over the next five to seven years. Another aim is to make a career in the armed forces ""much more attractive"" for youngsters. The Army, for instance, has an ""authorised strength"" of 46,280 officers but is making do with only 33,674 at present.

""The committee is deliberating on the level at which the exit policy should be introduced. Intake will have to be balanced with exit,"" said the officer. The exercise will not lead to any ""proliferation in ranks or dilution of authority"". ""The major beneficiaries will be officers in the lower ranks like captains, majors and colonels. There will only be a marginal proportionate increase in higher ranks like major-general and above. The same will be the case with the Navy and the IAF,"" said an officer.

Incidentally, the proposal to create a new rank called ""colonel-general"", between a corps commander and an Army commander, has been ""discarded since it was not found to be functionally workable"".

The measures being finalised are also aimed at reducing the present relatively longer command tenures at the battalion and brigade levels, while increasing the prevailing shorter tenures at the divisional and corps commander level.

2,More loan relief for drought-hit farmers,"NEW DELHI: Banks throughout the country have been instructed to postpone the collection of loan dues from farmers, Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh told a meeting of state ministers for cooperatives here on Thursday.

Singh said the situation created by the widespread failure of rain was quite serious though reports were still coming in on the actual extent of the problem.

Barring the north-east and some other states, the rest of the country is by and large affected and remedial measures need to be put in place without delay.

Commercial banks have been instructed through the Reserve Bank to convert short-term loans due this year into three to five-year term loans; farmers are also to be given fresh loans, with no penal interest charges. Similar instructions have gone through NABARD, the apex rural and coop bank, to the network of institutions it monitors.

So, too, for insurance coverage, especially regarding applications from farmers whose sowing has been delayed. As for cooperatives and the laws governing these, Singh urged all states to free these bodies from government restrictions.

He referred to the reforms recently enacted by Parliament to amend the multi-state coop law and loosenlending rules for the National Cooperative Development Corporation.

He added his ministry had finalised a Rs 80 billion package for restructuring Coop credit.

4,Charges against BCE principal to be probed,"PATNA: Patna University vice-chancellor K K Jha has instituted an inquiry committee to probe the charges of omissions and commissions levelled against Bihar College of Engineering principal H K Sinha and also to inquire into the alleged harassment of a senior teacher of the college.

The inquiry committee headed by PU pro-vice-chancellor Jitendra Singh consists of Science College principal Jagannath Thakur and head of geology department S N Sinha.

Earlier, a senior teacher of Bihar College of Engineering, Santosh Kumar, had urged the PU vice-chancellor to stop the college principal from harassing him and also to institute an inquiry into his alleged acts of omissions and commissions.

In a memorandum submitted to the vice-chancellor on Wednesday, Kumar alleged that he was being subjected to all sorts of harassments by the college principal without any rhyme or reason. If this did not stop immediately, he along with his wife would sit on dharna in front of the vice-chancellor office from August 14.

The memorandum pointed out that H K Sinha has scant regards for the rules and regulations of the university and flouts the orders of the vice-chancellor.

He does not stay in the campus quarter allotted to him and has allowed an ad-hoc teacher to reside in the quarter of a hostel superintendent.

Besides, he has appointed one junior teacher on important posts ignoring the claims of senior teachers.

He has also been using the vehicle of civil engineering department for his personal works, the memorandum added.

H K Sinha, when contacted, told TNN here on Thursday that a thorough inquiry would reveal who is at fault.

He described the act of Kumar in approaching the vice-chancellor directly without meeting him â€œas an act of indisciplineâ€� and said that necessary action might be initiated against him.

Hospital authorities were clearly more geared up after the initial two days of chaos, since the Joint Council of Health Employees called for a three-day strike on August 7. Category C and D employees of all Delhi hospitals, barring the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, had joined the strike between 9 am and 12 noon daily.

Employees of AIIMS, despite being affiliated to the council, have been banned by the high court from striking. In Guru Tegh Bahadur hospital, patients were seen directly by doctors without having to go through the OPD registration counters. These counters are normally manned by the employees who were on strike. A doctor said, â€˜â€˜The striking employees were a bit aggressive today and kept shouting slogans. But we managed our work.â€™â€™

In Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital where an NGO had brought in its volunteers to register OPD patients, trouble erupted early. The striking employees made it clear that volunteers could not do their work. Medical superintendent Dr K N Srivastava said, â€˜â€˜Our employees had begun to resent the involvement of the NGO. So we asked the volunteers to simply speak to the patients and send them to the correct departments.""

A number of traffic diversions have already been made and many more are in the offing. The university will call for a joint meeting with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the traffic police soon, officials added.

18,Riot victims take out rally with burnt goods,"AHMEDABAD: It is not always that burnt clothes, toys, shoes, tricycles, rickshaws, blackened utensils and a damaged car form part of a public display. All these articles, which were burnt during the riots, were displayed on handcarts as part of a rally taken out by riot victims in the city on Friday.

The rally that was aimed at highlighting the injustice done to riot victims was taken out in the riot affected areas of Bapunagar and Rakhial under heavy police bandobast. The unique rally saw the participation of orphans and widows of the riots.

Participants of the rally, organised by a group of voluntary organisations, carried placards with some uncomfortable questions written on them, including those on the mistrust between the two communities, about the loss of innumerable human lives and the partisan approach to relief measures.

""Who will listen to our complaints? Who will do justice?,"" screamed a banner. The rally also included exhibits giving a peek into what had happened in the state during the post-Godhra riots.

The city police had advised the organisers on Thursday against putting up provocative placards and banners. Besides this, the police were also upset over the display of riot-damaged goods on camel and hand carts.

""We kept the dais empty because it was not a forum to play politics, but was a platform for the common people desirous of bridging the gap among themselves irrespective of their faith,"" said H P Mishra of Kamdaar Swasthya Suraksha Mandal (KSSM).

""What has Gujarat transformed into? Today''s rally was just a reminder of what communalists have done to the state,"" said Indukumar Jani, a member of a voluntary organisation. Harnesh Pandya from Janpath, another voluntary organisation, pointed out to the disparities in awarding compensation and in the rehabilitation of the riot-affected.

19,Modi underplaying drought for polls: Jogi,"AHMEDABAD: Chhatisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi on Friday criticised the Narendra Modi government for ''hiding'' the actual drought situation in Gujarat so as to pursue its plan for early Assembly polls in the state.

Talking to newsmen, Jogi said inadequate rains during the current monsoon had caused havoc in many states of the country, including Gujarat. While the Rajasthan and Chhatisgarh governments had sought financial assistance from Centre to the tune of Rs 7,000 crore and Rs 2,200 crore respectively to meet the situation, Gujarat had ''deliberately'' sought a meagre assistance.

He accused the Modi government of having done so to push its case for early assembly polls as if the situation was ''normal'' on the drought front too. Gujarat was yet to seek funds from the national calamity fund too, he added. Describing the drought situation in Gujarat as ''grim'', Jogi alleged that BJP was playing with the life of the people by underestimating the drought, for political reasons.

Replying to questions, he said the BJP had ''repeatedly failed'' on all fronts in Gujarat and at the Centre. He exuded confidence that the Congress would return to power in Gujarat with a ''comfortable majority'' whenever assembly elections are held.
