0,Former MP flays Singhal’s remarks on riots,"MUMBAI: Former member of Parliament and vice- president of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) Gurudas Kamat has condemned the statement of Ashok Singhal, working president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), who has been quoted in a national daily as saying that Gujarat was a â€œsuccessful experimentâ€™â€™ that would be repeated all over India.

Mr Singhal, who was in Amritsar on Tuesday to inaugurate a physiotherapy centre, reportedly said that 50 lakh Hindus were out on the streets within a day of Godhra and that this showed that the Sangh Parivar was successful in raising Hindu consciousness. This, experiment, he said, would be repeated all over India.

Demanding the immediate arrest of the VHP leader, Mr Kamat said this was a confession that the VHP had experimented with its Hindutva ideology in Gujarat. He also said that this statement had confirmed the suspicion that the riots and the killings in Gujarat were stage-managed. The statement of Mr Singhal was also condemned by the Maharashtra Minorities Commission which, too, demanded the VHP leaderâ€™s arrest.

Meanwhile, Justice (retd) Hosbet Suresh told a group of social activists that the Narendra Modi-led BJP in Gujarat must be defeated at all costs.

Addressing a gathering of activists for a workshop on â€œGujarat Elections: Challenges before the secular and democratic forcesâ€™â€™ organised by Bombay Urban Industrial League for Development (BUILD) and Forum for Activists for Change and Empowerment (FACE), he said the communal violence in Gujarat was a state sponsored systematic massacre with the sole aim of polarising the voters on religious lines.

1,Constitution does not recognise caretaker govts: Vaghela,"AHMEDABAD: A high-level Congress delegation headed by Shankersinh Vaghela will urge President APJ Abdul Kalam to impose Presidentâ€™s rule in the state, on the grounds that â€œthere is no place for caretaker governments in the Constitutionâ€�.

Addressing newspersons, the partyâ€™s political spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said that there had been precedents where presidents had clipped the wings of caretaker governments at the Centre.

He cited the instances of Charan Singh and Chandrasekhar governments.

â€œWe will appeal to the President to make the Gujarat government aware of its limits, as the BJPâ€™s caretaker government has been misusing the government machinery, making election-related changes and declaring policies,â€� Gohil said.

He said that before the dissolution of the government, the Rajya Sabha had unanimously invoked Article 355 and intervened in Gujarat.

He added that such a government had no right to stay in power.

Gohil cited instances of high-level commissions and reports by NGOs who had held the BJP government responsible for the wide-spread riots in the state.

3,NJR returns to active politics,"GUNTUR: Signalling his return to active state politics, former chief minister and MP Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy has been participating in as many as party programmes as possible.

He was never seen so active after getting elected to the Lok Sabha twice from Guntur district. Reddy, who spared very little time even for his Lok Sabha constituencies Bapatla and Narasaraopet in the last four years, is now spending more time with the state leaders and touring districts whenever there is an opportunity.

According to sources, he is a serious contender for the post of Pradesh Congress Committee chief in the wake of rumours that the party high command is contemplating changing APCC president M Satyanarayana Rao.

In fact, Reddy''s political career, which suffered a jolt in 1994 after he lost the Assembly battle from his native constituency Venkatagiri, was resurrected in 1998 when he became an MP.

He had lobbied for a place in the Congress Working Committee (CWC) when the party discarded former chief minister late Kotla Vijayabhaskara Reddy. However, that vacancy was filled up first by M Lakshmidevi and then Sarojini Pulla Reddy.

The arrival of S Jaipal Reddy into the party too has complicated things for NJR.

Notwithstanding these, Janardhana Reddy is one among the very few in the Congress who enjoys the support of a large chunk of party legislators. He met AICC president Sonia Gandhi last week and reportedly discussed about the possible change of APCC president.

A group of MLAs too have reportedly sent a letter to the AICC president urging her to nominate either NJR or his legislator wife Rajyalakshmi for post of the PCC president.

4,MBBS quota rules create new roadblock,"PATNA: The admissions to the first year MBBS course of the six medical colleges of the state this year seem to be jinxed.

Close on the heels of stay on admissions until further order following detection that the Bihar Combined Entrance Competitive Examination Board (BCECEB) did not comply with Medical Council of India (MCI) Regulation on Graduate Medical Education (Amendment), 1999, while recommending placement of candidates to these colleges, the admission process has hit another roadblock related to reservation quota.

The BCECEB is now faced with the question whether it should recommend placements to the medical colleges on the basis of the old reservation Act or the new one. The board, which met on Friday to discuss the situation in the light of 1999 Regulation being ignored in the admission process, has decided to seek the opinion of the law department on reservation issue. The stay on admissions will continue till the law department gives its opinion on the matter.

The personnel and administrative reforms department on September 3 directed all departmental heads, chairman of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, all divisional commissioners, district magistrates, secretary, Bihar Public Service Commission, examination controller, BCECEB, all vice-chancellors and registrar, Patna High Court, to ensure the implementation of the new reservation Act.

The new Act, it may be recalled, reallocated reservation quota among the beneficiary groups in the wake of bifurcation of Bihar.

The BCECEB organised counselling of the candidates declared successful at the combined entrance examination from August 21 to August 26 and recommended their placements to the six medical colleges on the basis of old reservation Act before September 3. Interestingly, the results of competitive examination was declared on the basis of old reservation policy.

A senior official of the health department said that the BCECEB would have to organise fresh counselling of candidates if the the law department recommended implementation of the new reservation Act for the current academic session.

The BCECEB had earlier stayed the admissions when a student, Aditya Bhushan, on August 30 pointed out to the principal of Patna Medical College that the BCECEB did not follow the MCI Regulation on Graduate Medical Education (Amendment), 1999, while making recommendations for the placement of candidates to the six medical colleges.

The BCECEB had recommended placements on the basis of Regulation on Graduate Medical Education, 1997, even as it had been replaced with new regulation published in the gazette on May 29, 1999. A senior official of BCECEB said that the board recommended placements of candidates on the basis of 1997 Regulation as it did not have the copy of 1999 Regulation.

Under the 1997 Regulation, it was mandatory for a candidate declared successful at the entrance examination to secure not less than 50 per cent marks in English at Inter level.

5,Kaleswara Rao Market inaugurated amid protests,"VIJAYAWADA: Revenue minister P Ashok Gajapathi Raju, municipal administration minister N Md Farook and agriculture minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao inaugurated different blocks in the newly-constructed Kaleswara Rao General Market Complex here on Friday amidst high drama and strong protests from the Congress and Left-wing parties.

Mayor P Anuradha, Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri Urban Development Authority chairperson Kolli Sharada, municipal commissioner Praveen Prakash and others were present on the occasion.

Unprecedented security arrangements were made under the supervision of three assistant commissioners of police for the inaugural function as the Congress leaders held a dharna in front of the market complex demanding that the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation drop the move to sell away shopping complexes.

On the other hand, the CPI and the CPM leaders gheraoed Farook on the same issue at the municipal guest house and tried to prevent him from going to the venue.

Sensing trouble, ministers Vadde Sobhanadreesawara Rao and Ashok Gajapathi Raju quietly drove away from the state guest house to Vuyyuru to inaugurate the mandal revenue office and police station buildings.

Reports from Vuyyuru said that these inaugurations too were marred by protests from the local people over the location of the buildings.

The inauguration of KR Market complex, scheduled for 8.30 am, was delayed by well over three-and-a-half hours as the protests continued.

Vadde and Gajapathi Raju returned to the city around 11.50 am to attend the inauguration of the market complex. The Congress workers planned to block the ministers'' convoy at the Tummalapallivari Kshetrayya Kalakshetram, but the police diverted the convoy via Krishna Lanka.

Vijayawada West MLA Jaleel Khan, District Congress Committee president Mandali Buddha Prasad, city Congress chief Kadiyala Butchi Babu and former minister Devineni Rajasekhar led the agitation. The protestors blocked traffic for over half-an-hour.

Meanwhile, at the municipal guest house, former mayor T Venkateswara Rao, former deputy mayor V Umamaheswara Rao, CPM floor leader Ch Babu Rao and CPI city secretary K Sekhar Babu entered into a wordy duel with Farook over the state government''s moves relating to the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation.

They strongly objected to the manner in which the state government issued a GO, overruling the elected Councilâ€™s resolution on the privatisation of marriage halls, parks and the vehicle depot in the city.

The municipal administration minister conceded that the GOs should not be issued sidestepping the Council. He promised to look into the issue and take appropriate action.

6,TDP leaders protest govt decisions on civic body,"VIJAYAWADA: Leaders of the city Telugu Desam Party unit raised a banner of revolt against the state government and strongly deplored its ""unilateral actions"" on issues relating to the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation.

City mayor P Anuradha, however, was isolated on the issue and had to face the wrath of her party colleagues.

City TDP convener K V P Basaveswara Rao led a delegation of party leaders to municipal administration and urban development minister N Md Farook here on Friday and expressed serious displeasure over the issue of GOs sidestepping the elected Council.

""The government is virtually killing the party in the city with its policies. We will not win the next elections if the government thrusts its unilateral decisions on the city,"" the TDP leaders lamented before the minister.

The TDP leaders particularly came down heavily on the government for issuing a GO for privatisation of marriage halls and parks in the city. They also deplored the proposal to sell away municipal shopping complexes.

""The opposition parties are taking advantage of the situation and attacking the chief minister. We are unable to face the people. We cannot understand why the government is ignoring the elected Council in the VMC,"" the TDP leaders observed.

When mayor Anuradha sought to back the state government stating that maintenance of marriage halls and shopping complexes was not the core activity of the civic body, the TDP leaders lashed out at her too.

The main responsibility of the civic body is to ensure safe drinking water supply, better roads and a good drainage system, Anuradha said.

At that stage, corporators V Dange Kumar and Chennupati Gandhi criticised the mayor and said she was acting like a dictator.

The minister told the party delegation that there was no question of overlooking the VMC Council resolutions. The government will not take any decisions unilaterally.

The government will respect the Council decisions and only under compelling circumstances issue GOs, Farook asserted.

7,BJP woo minorities ahead of Assembly polls,"KOLKATA: To tone up the party organisation before the Assembly polls in nine states, BJP President Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday stressed on gaining confidence of the minorities.

Naidu also launched a frontal attack on the Congress and CPI-M for steering a slander campaign and adopting a ''spit and run'' policy to tarnish the image of the Vajpayee government.

In his inaugural address at the two-day zonal conference of BJP units of the Eastern states, Naidu said that ''pseudo- secularists and a section of the media'' were creating an impression as if the minroities were not safe in the BJP rule.

""We want to ask who is responsible for the condition of the minorities over the past 50 years, mostly under Congress rule... we will have to go to the minorities, listen to their problems and allay their fears'''', the BJP Chief said.

The conference aimed at mid-term appraisal of the NDA government and introspection on the state of the party, was attended by union ministers Promode Mahajan, Sushma Swaraj, Shahnawaz Hussain besides five general secretaries and a host of leaders from West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Sikkim.

8,Onus for J&K talks on govt: Shah,"SRINAGAR: Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah on Saturday said ""the ball is now in Delhi''s court"" and it was upto it to take steps to resolve the Kashmir issue. Shah also dismissed the upcoming assembly polls in the state as a ""sham"".

""The ball in their (Centre) court now. Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s refusal (to meet) has proved that government cannot face us on the table,"" Shah told a press conference here after returning from New Delhi where he held second round of talks with Kashmir Committee.

""The major achievement of my visit to Delhi was countering the propaganda that Kashmiris are not willing to negotiate,"" the Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party President said.

Shah said he felt ""conspiracies"" were hatched to sabotage efforts to resolve Kashmir issue.

""Not only in Delhi but the rulers in Srinagar also are creating innumerous hurdles in the peace process in order to maintain the status quo in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said.

He said there was no way his party would contest elections in the state that were meant just for ""governance"".

""Our stand on the issue is clear and we have issued instructions to our cadres to stay away from the polls.""

9,Pranab holds govt responsible for militancy in Bengal,"SILIGURI: West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (WBPCC) Chief Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday held the Left front government responsible for rise of Kamtapuri movement in North Bengal.

The state government did not take any care for socio-economic uplift of the people of the region, the root cause of a section of people taking up arms now, Mukherjee said while addressing a booth based party workers'' conference organised by Darjeeling (plain) District Congress at Dinabandhu Manch here.

The senior Congress leader also made it amply clear that his party did not support Kamtapur People''s Party''s (KPP) demand for a separate state.

On the alleged failure of West Bengal police to check militancy, Mukherjee said the Left Front, CPI-M in particular, should allow police to work freely.

""If the ''party control'' on police is not immediately lifted, the law and order situation will worsen further"", he cautioned.

Addressing the grassroot workers of the party, Mukherjee said key of success of CPI-M in the state was not the public support but its well practiced ''scientific rigging'' which could only be stopped by dedicated Congress workers at the grassroot level.

Without naming Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, the veteran Congress leader reiterated that individual influence could never benefit a political party, particularly in the battle of ballots. And this very truth had been proved time and again, Mukherjee added.

10,Increased infiltration aimed at disrupting J&K polls: Army,"JAMMU: Increased infiltration of armed militants into Jammu and Kashmir of late is aimed at disrupting election process in the state, a senior army official said on Saturday.

This was brought to light with the foiling of yet another infiltration bid from across the Line of Control (LoC) at Panjaninallah in Poonch on Friday night, Bhimber Gali Bridge Commander Brig KVS Lalotra told visiting newsmen here on Saturday.

He said, ""The group of four hardcore terrorists, which was eliminated, belonged to Hazb-i-islami and was on a mission to disrupt elections by triggering multiple explosions and firing of grenades in Rajouri-Poonch belt"".

The group had brought with them Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), UBGL grenades and a large quantity of ammunition rounds to blow up polling stations, target candidates, blast vehicles and fire grenades on security camps in order to create terror among the border-district population and keep them away from the poll process, Lalotra said.

Terming Pakistan''s statement that they had no knowledge of infiltration continuing as absurd, he said, ""How is it possible that Pakistan army does not know that this militant group crossed into this side from Dorian Pak post, which is just a eye-ball to eyeball distance from our post"".

Infact, Pakistan is actively training, aiding and providing logistic support in pushing them into Indian soil, the official said adding infiltrations into Rajouri and Poonch sectors have increased as polls are to be held in the belt in the first phase scheduled on September 16.

11,Mamata flays party chief whip for BJP ties,"KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress Chief Whip in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandopadhyay on Saturday came under fire from party supremo Mamata Banerjee for ''hobnobbing'' with BJP and inviting Communication minister Promode Mahajan for a tea-party at his residence defying the party''s decision to stay away from the NDA.

The TC Chief who was at loggerhead with Bandopadhyay, her one-time close associate on the Eastern railway bifurcation issue, categorically said that the party did not approve of his move to invite senior BJP minister Promode Mahajan for the tea-party.

Speaking at a seminar on ''Railway Bifurcation'' here in which Bandopadhyay was also present, Mamata in an obvious reference to him said, ''''when the party''s working committee has taken the decision that TC will not be part and parcel of NDA until the Centre takes corrective steps regarding Eastern railway bifurcation, everyone should respect it''''.

''''We should distance ourselves from the NDA. There is no question of hosting any such tea party. No one has the right to violate the party decision'''', she said.

Party''s decision could only be changed by the working committee, Mamata said.

Asked for his reaction, Bandopadhyay declined to make any comment.

Bandopadhyay had said yesterday that Mahajan was the Parliamentary Affairs Minister and he was still the party''s Chief Whip and when Mahajan comes to his constituency, what was wrong in having tea with him.

12,No question of Hurriyat participating in polls: Jethmalani,"NEW DELHI: Kashmir Committee Chairman Ram Jethmalani on Saturday night said the talks with the Hurriyat Conference are to find a long-term solution to the Kashmir problem and there was no chance of the amalgam participating in the polls.

Jethmalani, who began a crucial second-round of talks with the Hurriyat this evening, said even the conditions put forth by Shabir Shah for his participation in the elections has not (not) been met by the Centre and therefore there was no question of Hurriyat participating in the polls.

13,Six arrested for kidnapping city medico,"AHMEDABAD: Six persons were arrested early on Saturday from Surendranagar district by the city police on charges of kidnapping a city-based doctor. Dr Nipam Rasiklal Mistry (38), had been kidnapped around 9.30 pm on June 3.

Mastermind of this kidnap bid Dipak Karshanbhai Patel (26), along with his associates - Gopal Nudha Bhadwad (22), Jagdish alias Jago Chawda (23), Raju Madhu Kholi (24), Manish alias Chiko Patel and Jatin - have been arrested and booked for kidnapping Dr Mistry and demanding ransom. Two others of the gang, Jigar Rameshbhai Jotwani and Ramesh Jethabhia Bhadwad, however, remain at large.

The kidnappers, on Thursday, had demanded Rs 25 lakh for the release of Dr Mistry. The rescue was the result of a well-co-ordinated drive conducted by the city police, crime branch and Surendranagar police. The crucial clue in cracking this case came from the cellular phone of Dr Mistry''s brother, Rakesh, where the kidnappers used to call up for demanding ransom.

Late on June 3, when Dr Mistry was sitting with a friend, Sonalben Mehta (36), at a lawn near Grand Bhagwati Hotel alongside Sarkhej-Gandhinagar highway, they were kidnapped by four youths armed with knives.

Dr Mistry''s Santro (GJ-1BK-1096) was used to kidnap the duo. Mehta was, however, let-off near Sokhli village on the Sanand-Viramgam highway. The doctor was then taken to Gajanvav village of Dhangadra taluka in Surendranagar district.

A complaint in this regard was lodged with the Satellite police by Dr Mistry''s brother Rakesh Mistry. When the ransom call was made on Rakesh''s mobile phone, a Surendranagar-number flashed, which in effect gave police their clue. Three teams were despatched to Surendranagar, while crime branch officials kept Surendranagar police informed on the numbers being used to make ransom calls.

At 10.30 pm on Friday, Bhadwad and Chawda were arrested while making ransom calls from a telephone booth near Surendra nagar ST stand. Interrogation of the duo helped police swoop down on Dipak and Kohli.

""The co-ordination shown by city policemen, crime branch and Surendranagar police is admirable. We expect to arrest the remaining two accused soon,"" said the commissioner of police K R Kaushik.

The decision was taken following a proposal from the century-old temple to the Tamil Nadu transport ministry in view of the steady increase in the number of devotees visiting the temple from that state, temple executive officer E K Babu said.

The bus service would be initially introduced on a daily basis from Coimbatore as a majority of the devotees came from Salem, Erode and Coimbatore besides a good number coming from Chennai and Pondicherry, he said, adding the services would later be extended to other major towns also.

16,"Check fee source, Bitta tells lawyers","LUDHIANA: All India Anti-Terrorist Front chairman Maninderjit Singh Bitta on Saturday made a fervent appeal to lawyers across the country to confirm the source of funds to be paid as their fee before taking up cases related to acts of terrorist violence.

Talking to mediapersons here, Bitta, who had survived a powerful bomb blast at IYC office at New Delhi in 1993 in which 35 persons, mostly Congress workers had died, urged the lawyers to draw a clear line between their professional ethics and duty towards the nation.

Recently, much heat was raised among political circles over Bitta taking strong exception to senior Supreme Court advocate Kapil Sibal pleading the case of commutation of death sentence of dreaded terrorist Davinder Pal Singh into life imprisonment.

Davinder Pal Singh was awarded the death sentence for his involvement in the terrorist attack at the IYC office.

Bitta said that he had been informed about a fresh threat to his life on telephone by one Maninder Singh Gill from Canada who had also told him that some influential people had gained access within the Congress party to eliminate him and some other party leaders.

He said that he was also told that the conspiracy of the bomb blast at the IYC office was hatched in Canada.

In view of this, access of a terrorist to Sibal was a dangerous matter, Bitta said. He apprehended that if the death sentence of Davinder Pal Singh got commuted into life imprisonment, the convicted terrorist could still operate from within the jail premises. Stoutly denying any political motive, Bitta said he was a loyal Congress worker and would remain throughout his life.

He said he had written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on the issue as the shameful act of defending a convicted terrorist, who killed Congress party workers, amounted to a conspiracy against the party.

17,Discontentment among poll staff over selection,"PATHANKOT: Even as the Pathankot administration held a rehearsal drill on Saturday for the employees to be sent to Jammu and Kashmir on poll duty, discontentment over their selection has started brewing among them.

Demanding a CBI or vigilance probe into the changes made in the original list, they said that it was done under the political pressure of the high and mighty, who got the names of their near ones deleted from the list. More than 400 government staff of Gurdaspur district find their names on the list but are reluctant to join the duty.

The reason for not joining the poll duty vary from person to person. For some it is inability to read and write in Urdu, while for others it is terrorism. But their biggest fear remain the poll violence.

As a protest against this, government teachers had held a protest march at the Government Senior Secondary School Lamini, Pathankot on Wednesday.

Majority of the government employees whose names are on the duty list include teachers and employees of the Ranjit Sagar Dam. There was hectic lobbying to get their names struck off from the list, said the sources, adding that the office of the Pathankot SDM was flooded with requests and recommendation for withdrawal of the names of some of the â€œfavouredâ€� officials by the local ministers and MLAs.

Many of them managed to get their names deleted from the list. Others, who have not been lucky so far, are trying their best to get duty exemption on one pretext or the other.

Talking to Times News Network on Saturday, general secretary of Government Teachersâ€™ Union Kewal Krishan said, â€œOn Teacherâ€™s Day, the government had assured the teachers that they would not be assigned non-teaching duties. And now we find that most of the government employees selected for poll duty comprise teachers.â€�

â€œMy name was not on the original list. But somebody managed to get his name out of the list and now I find my name there. Isnâ€™t this unfair?â€� said Avtar Singh, a science teacher. While most of them are coming out with medical certificates showing inability to join work, senior officials who have made the list said that they had no other option but to join the duty or they would face disciplinary action.

Pathankot SDM Punit Goyal, however, said that most of the people were willing to do the election duty voluntarily.

18,"Stripped of power, farmers plan agitation","KAMBOH, Amritsar: With the Punjab government abolishing free electricity supply, the farmers foresee gloomy days ahead, occupied with violent agitations and even suicide attempts.

The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission on Friday had ordered a tariff of Rs two per unit of power for agricultural power users who had been enjoying the free facility introduced by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal almost five-and-ahalf-years ago.

A Times News Network team, which visited a couple of villages of Amritsar district on Saturday to find out the reaction of the farmers, witnessed emergency meetings being held by the farmers at many village squares to discuss their next course of action.

The farmers, making a volteface from their earlier stand of willing to pay the electricity bill against the uninterrupted power supply, now, instead, detailed their wish list including more subsidies on fertilisers and seeds besides restoration of the withdrawn facility of electricity supply. The farmers also indicated to hold a massive agitation in the near future.

However, farmers who own small land holdings and were reportedly reeling under heavy debts, even pointed out at committing suicides if no immediate succour was provided to them.

Mittar Singh, a septuagenarian farmer of Kamboh village, said that the earlier decision of Badal government for providing free electricity supply had resulted in higher produce per acre as the farmers were able to buy fertilisers due to the money saved by not paying the electricity bills.

He said Amarinder Singh had betrayed them as even he had promised to continue the free power supply. The farmers may even challenge the governmentâ€™s decision in the court, he added.

The farmers, who receive one time payment of their crops after every six months, spend their entire money on clearing debts and making essential purchases.

â€˜â€˜How would the farmers be able to make payments after every month or two especially when they had not been doing so for the last five years?â€� asked Mitter Singh.

Sadhu Singh, a farmer of Rakh Nag village, said that he was under debt of around Rs one lakh which he was unable to pay for last several years. â€˜â€˜How would I pay the electricity bill? Either I have to stop paying school fee of my children or take more loans,â€� he added.

Taking his anger out on the government, Sadhu Singh claimed that he was being exploited by the private shellers who buy paddy at a much lesser rate than the minimum support price.

â€˜â€˜What right does this government have in withdrawing a facility from farmers when it doesnâ€™t take any notice of the alleged whimsical attitude of shellers?â€� he questioned. Joginder Singh, sarpanch of Khairdeen village, said that an agitation was imminent.

â€˜â€˜What else does the government accepts from us?â€� he asked. He, however, apprehended that even after charging for electricity, the government would not be able to provide regular power supply.
