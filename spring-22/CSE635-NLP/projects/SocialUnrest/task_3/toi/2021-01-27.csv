0,Defaulting farmers get MSEB’s VIP treatment,"MUMBAI: A high-power team of 22 VIPs is pounding the dusty interiors of the state in their white Ambassadors trailed by Tata Sumos.At country corners, they halt to make a stirring speech.

This is no poll rally,but â€˜Operation Arrears Attackâ€™ by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to coax money out of its largest chunk of defaulters, the farmers.And the VIPs are the boardâ€™s seniormost office-bearersâ€” up to chairperson Asoke Basak.

In a mega-campaign to repair its balance sheet, the MSEB has launched Krishi Sanjeevani Yojana with an enormous lolly for agricultural defaulters â€”pay up 50 per cent of your principal amount, and the balance, including the interest and delayed payment charges thereon, will be waived.

The amount can be paid in three equal instalments from January to March.

At last count, the MSEB is reeling under arrears of Rs 9,500 crore, of which Rs 3,148 crore is accounted for by the agricultural sector. If the scheme runs its course, the MSEB will land Rs 1,037 crore in its kitty, as the principal dues of the farmers amount to Rs 2,074 crore.

A brainchild of power minister Dilip Walse-Patil, the scheme is drawing good response in many places. In Nagpur, farmers are queuing up to pay. On a single day, 73 of them paid up. In Parbhani district, the campaign has rendered three villagesâ€”Maregaon, Kavalgaon and Pimpalgaonâ€” debtfree.

Under the scheme, defaulting farmers have to pay up their last bill for April-September 2003 by January 31 to be eligible for the waiver. Accordingly, the MSEB hopes to net Rs 600 crore by this monthend.

Conscious of the fact that defaulters always seem to get away with sops, the MSEB has also incorporated a bonanza for the farmers who are punctual in their payments. Those who have already paid their current bills will be given a 50 per cent discount over the entire year.

Though starved of cash itself, the government will share some of the MSEBâ€™s waiver burden. It will reimburse the MSEB to the extent of the principal amount not paid by the farmers and half the interest amount, totalling Rs 1,547 crore.

1,"Couple kill kids, commit suicide","MUMBAI: A young couple in heavy debt allegedly poisoned their three small children and then committed suicide at their home in Sion on Monday morning.

According to the police, Sanjay Nalawade (35), owner of Trimurti Mandap Decorators in Girgaum, and his wife Parvati (30) probably laced some soft drink or milk with insecticides and gave it to their children, Harish (6), Santoshi (3) and Vaishnavi (1). They then hung themselves from a hook in their two-room home in Ramjimahith Patel Society, Pratiksha Nagar.

The incident occurred in the morning, just hours before an official from the Prerna Cooperative Credit Society came to collect a loan of Rs 5 lakh, which may have been used to buy their residence. Nalawade had also taken a loan from Nyana Sadan Cooperative to run his business.

According to deputy commissioner of police Pratap Dighavkar, Nalawade left three notes, one to each lender, apologising for taking the loan and stating that he was not in a position to repay it. There was also a note addressed to his brother, Sunil Nalawade, asking him not to take a loan to repay his loans.

Police are awaiting the post-mortem results on the deaths of the children.

2,HC: CBI to probe minister's threats,"RANCHI: The Jharkhand High Court on Tuesday directed the CBI to investigate the case lodged with the Jharia police station, Dhanbad, regarding threats given by urban development minister Baccha Singh to the district administration that it would face dire consequences if they arrest Rajeev Singh and Ramadhin Singh, the main accused in the murder of Pramod Singh, a coal merchant.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice P K Iyer Balasubramaniyan and Justice Amreshwar Sahay passed the order while hearing a writ petition filed by Rajeev Kumar, IG, Dhanbad.

3,People urged to join Shabdo protest,"PATNA: A number of prominent social scientists and activists have appealed to all concerned in the country and abroad for mobilising people to join the protest at Shabdo village in Gaya district on February 12 against the recent killing of social workers Sarita and Mahesh Kant.

The appeal made by Medha Patkar of Narmada Bachao Andolan, Harsh Mander of Actionaid, Jean Dreze of the Delhi School of Economics and others has been circulated through pamphlets and other modes of communication.

The appeal says, â€œIt is time to speak for democracy in Bihar; it is time to act for ourselves, to choose between political correctness and a truthful politics for democratic values.â€�

A committee with Priyadarshi as its convener has been formed in Bihar to coordinate the protest movement against the killing of the duo. A protest march was held here on Monday in which hundreds of people participated. A meeting was held after the march where it was decided that a public meeting would be held at the Gandhi Sangrahalaya on January 29 to pay tributes to Sarita and Mahesh.

A protest sit-in would be held on January 30 here at the JP statue, and on February 12, a national protest march would be organised from here to Shabdo village. In Delhi, a protest meeting is to be held on January 31 at the Gandhi Peace Foundation.

In the appeal, Mander, country director of Actionaid, said: â€œThey had obviously disturbed the power equation of the countryside having educated the villagers living in Shabdo and its vicinity to the extent that they started to speak for themselves, take decision for themselves, manage their own land and school for their children, understand and articulate their rights which greatly upset the local mafia which is being patronised by the ruling party of Bihar.â€�

4,Convicts hold their own election here,"HYDERABAD: Away from the rough and tumble of electoral politics, there''s yet another world where ballot battles rage behind the bars.

Call this the nether world of electoral politics, if you may. But there are principles here, codes of conduct and -â€” pretty much like in normal elections -â€” candidates go canvassing for support. In the elections to the prison panchayats too, promises fly thick and fast.

The convict''s parliament works in Andhra Pradesh''s jails and unlike in a parliamentary democracy, elections are held every six months. The prison authorities play referee â€”-election commission in popular parlance -â€” and supervise the polls with a great degree of seriousness.

The world of the criminal -â€” unlike what the popular perception is -â€” too is run by a code of principles. In other words, there are criminals among criminals. The hardcore ones -â€” those who have committed atrocities on women, dacoits and those with patchy prison records -â€” are barred from contesting.

The Cherlapalli Central Jail prisoners'' parliament went to the hustings on January 13 and as many as 20 convicts were in the fray for the six seats. The campaign trail lasted 10 days and the more-than 1,600 inmates picked P Ramamurthy, K Muthyalu, J Ramulu, P Shankar, R Yadagiri and Syed Arshid as their representatives.

The door-to-door campaigns, which the netas are so adept at, have their own variant here. Candidates go cell-to-cell. But there are no loudspeakers, no bands of cheering supporters, no festoons. ""You can say, the campaign is more of a person-to-person affair,"" says a jail official.

And, it''s confined to the day time. ""The election is open and fair,"" says additional D-G, prisons, P Narasimha Reddy. You literally can''t rig the polls here, for voting is through the show of hands. No ballot papers. No EVMs. Also, unlike the ballot battles of the world beyond the walls, here there is no violence.

""The campaign is peaceful. Seldom do you have fights breaking out,"" a Charlapalli prison staff says.

Hardcore criminals and those who break the jail rules are barred from contesting the election. Campaigning is usually a person-toperson affair and polls are held by show of hand and not by balloting.

The elected representatives oversee the functioning of facilities such as hospital and sanitation.

5,Pooja says no to politics,"PATNA: Maverick film-maker Mahesh Bhatt and his equally maverick daughter Pooja Bhatt love Bihar and the synonym of Bihar in Bollywood, Laloo Prasad Yadav. The Bhatts arrived in the city on Monday to attend the premiere show of â€œPaapâ€�, a film directed by Pooja. It is Poojaâ€™s debut film as a director.

â€œI love Patna. It is a lucky place for me. I had released â€˜Tamannaâ€™, my first film as a producer, here. The film was a hit. This time, I released my first film as a director, â€˜Paapâ€™, here. The response of the audience was tremendous,â€� Pooja said. The Bhatts praised RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, saying Laloo is their favourite hero. â€œIf people want to get rid of communal forces in the country, the charge should be given to Lalooji. He can eliminate divisive forces,â€� Mahesh Bhatt said.

The Bhatts, accompanied by film star John Abraham, drove straight to Lalooâ€™s residence immediately after their arrival at the Patna airport. Earlier, Laloo was supposed to be the chief guest at the premiere show. But the Bhatts arrived late in the city, so the earlier programme was rescheduled. The premiere show was held at the local Regent Cinema Hall.

Does she plan to enter politics? â€œI am an entertainer and I just want to entertain people. Politics is not my cup of tea,â€� Pooja said.

7,BJP launches election campaign from Dhanbad,"DHANBAD: With general elections round the corner, the BJP launched its election campaign, â€˜Mission 2004â€™, in the state from Dhanbad.

Inaugurating the district-level party workers conference at the local Town Hall here on Sunday, the national vice-president of the party and former state chief minister Babulal Marandi called upon the party workers to work tirelessly for propagating the achievements of the Central as well as the state government among the masses.

Poverty ratio in the last six years of Vajpayee regime has come down from 32 per cent to 27 per cent and poverty would be completely eliminated by 2020, he said. â€œWhat the Vajpayee government did in last six years, the Congress regime could not do it in the last 50 years, as far as development is concernedâ€�, said Marandi.

The economy of the country has improved like never before and with foreign nationals, including the NRIs, showing their inclination to come back to India, the very process of brain drain has been reversed.

Taking a dig at Congress, Marandi said that Sonia has even lost confidence of her party workers as they are now relying more on Rahul and Priyanka.

Jharkhand BJP president Abhaykant Prasad, state HRD minister PN Singh, Dhanbad MP Rita Verma, Giridih MP Ravindra Pandey, state BJP secretary Vijay Jha, Sindri MLA Phoolchand Mandal, newly-elected district BJP president Raj Sinha and former district president Satyendra Kumar in their speeches enumerated the achievements of the Central as well as the state government and exhorted the party workers to work with dedication.

8,‘Silent’ majority lodges protest,"PUNE: They represented a â€˜silent majorityâ€™. They came in the hundreds and, without uttering a single word, spoke volumes about their concern about the recent vandalism at the Bhandarkar oriental research institute (Bori).

It may be recalled that nearly 100 activists of the selfstyled â€˜Sambhaji Brigadeâ€™ had on January 5 destroyed heritage archives at the institute, over American author James Laineâ€™s book Shivaji: A Hindu King in Islamic India. On Republic Day, inspired by a chain e-mail circulated over the last two weeks, citizens made a beeline for the institute to register a silent protest against the vandalism.

This, despite a police warning against gathering at the institute on R-Day. Every protestor dropped a rupee coin in specially placed urns, as a token contribution towards the restoration of the institute.

Clarifying that the institute had no role in organising the protest, Boriâ€™s regulating council chairperson Leela Arjunwadkar, however, said, â€œPersonally, I felt it was a touching gesture.â€�

Vinita Tatke, a concerned citizen and a volunteer, told TNN that as many as Rs 6,119 had been collected during the silent protest and that the amount would soon be donated to the institute.

â€œPeople started pouring in from 8 am onwards.However, around 10.30 am, the police asked us to disperse in order to avert untoward incidents.

The protestors readily obeyed. Nevertheless, people continued to trickle in till 5.30 pm and gathered outside the Bori premises and dropped in their Re 1 contribution,â€� Tatke said.

Among the well-known people who joined the protest were activist R.P. Nene, journalist Shanta Gokhale, Nirmalatai Purandare, filmmaker Amol Palekar, playwright Satish Alekar, academician Ram Bapat, actor Mohan Agashe and theatre-person Samar Nakhate.

â€œThe gesture has really touched me. All I can say is that we, at Bori, are extremely overwhelmed by the public support and solidarity,â€� said Saroja Bhate, honorary secretary, Bori.

Mrunalini Joshi, a schoolgirl, said she had dropped two coins in order to register a â€œstrongerâ€� protest.

10,Rashtriya Chemicals staff bid for govt's stake,"MUMBAI: The employees and management of Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF) have bid for 51 per cent of the company''s equity that the government has put up for sale.

The Tata group and Reliance are the other major contenders. The bidding process closed on Tuesday and the short-listed bidders will now have to demonstrate their credentials to the inter-ministerial group (IMG) on disinvestment.

The employee-management team at RCF has incorporated a public limited company called Ujwal Fertilizers, through which a letter of intent (LoI) has been submitted to ICICI Securities, the advisors to the disinvestment process.

Ujwal Fertilizers has secured a letter of credit for Rs 300 crore from Bank of Maharashtra, sources close to the bidding process told Times News Network.

The bid document requires the bidder to have a net worth of at least Rs 300 crore.

The RCF employees have appointed SBI Caps as the advisors as well as the lead arrangers for funding their bid, which has the support of 570 employees, the sources said.

As per a government notification dated April 25, 2003, a bid by the employees or management for a PSU being divested will be preferred if it is within a 10 per cent range of the highest bid.

The employees of RCF are in talks with several other banks like Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and ABN Amro to fund the acquisition of 51 per cent of the government''s 92.5 per cent stake in the fertiliser and chemicals company.

The employee-management team has assured the banks that the management of the company would remain largely unaltered if they were to win the bid.

""The reason for the employees and management jumping into the fray was largely to protect the interests of the 4,500-strong employees of the public sector undertaking. Besides, the company has huge property assets in Mumbai and Thal, which the employees fear could be stripped by an outside party,"" the sources said.

RCF has a turnover of Rs 2,200 crore and its assets are valued at around Rs 1,000 crore. The company reported a gross profit of Rs 75 crore for the first half of 2003-04.

11,Bird flu creates panic among Amritsar poultry farmers,"AMRITSAR: Panic has gripped poultry farmers of Amritsar''s border district especially after Pakistan reported death of four million chicken due to spread of strain similar to bird flu.

Both, the hatcheries and the governments'' animal husbandry department have drawn battle plans to tackle the virus and are sending their teams of veterinary doctors and pathologists to the poultry farms of the area to collect blood, droppings and other samples for testing. They are looking for symptoms similar to that of bird flu so that necessary action could be taken to prevent mass mortality of birds and economic losses to farmers.

Bird flu has reportedly affected millions of chickens in Pakistan and other Asian countries. The virus, highly contagious among chickens, is believed to spread to humans through contact with infected birds.

The animal husbandry department have issued instructions to customs department to deport any animal brought from Pakistan through Samjhauta Express or through road after apprehending the possibility of bringing of such animals by passengers coming from Pakistan.

Notably before the suspension of Samjhauta Express, passengers arriving from Pakistan used to bring Dumbas (kind of sheep) from Pakistan. Few Dumbas were detained and were disposed of as they were found to be positive for Morbilli virus said R P Goyal, deputy director, animal husbandry department while talking to TNN on Wednesday.

Baljit Singh Sidhu, Director, animal husbandry informed TNN over phone that due to outbreak of disease in the neighbouring Pakistan, they have to be extra alert by surveying poultry farms in the area. However, he said they could do little to prevent spread of infection by air through birds like pigeons etc.

Goyal said the samples collected from poultry farms would be sent to Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar. Besides this he said, ""meetings would be held with poultry farmers to bring awareness among them about taking preventive steps.""

Sandeep Chawla, owner of a poultry farm agreed that farmers panicked due to outbreak of disease in Pakistan but added that they were taking all preventive measures. Avipreet Singh, another farmer said that ""there is very little we can do to prevent spreading of infection through air, yet we are taking precautions."" Both of them claimed that their sales have not been affected as yet.

Another farmer not willing to give his name said that in the year 2002 there was similar outbreak of disease having symptoms similar to that of bird flu and had caused about 25 per cent loss of poultry birds. The disease had spread from Angara area of Paksitan to Chabhal area of Amritsar district. The first case was reported from Gagubuha.

13,We're ready to face LS polls: Krishna,"BANGALORE: Preparation for Lok Sabha elections is not being made by either the state or Central government, but the Election Commission of India, said Chief Minister S M Krishna speaking on the impending polls.

""As far as law and order is concerned, that is the state government''s responsibility, I can assure the Election Commission that we shall ensure a peaceful and fair conduct of elections,"" Krishna said, answering reporters questions on preparations for polls around the corner.

""I have always said that the Lok Sabha polls were around the corner and we are ready to face it,"" said Krishna. However, Krishna remained non-committal on advancing Assembly elections in the state, refusing to comment on its timing.

Speaking to reporters after he launched a pilot project for the Edusat satellite on Wednesday at ISRO headquarters, he said his government was ready to face early Lok Sabha polls.

Asked about the possibility of an early Assembly poll in the state, he said ""Yesterday, I said, time only will decide.""

Asked if he favoured an early Assembly poll or not, he said: ""I am not going to react to that, because there are so many things involved.""

Speaking earlier at the launch of the pilot project for Edusat, an exclusive education satellite for distance learning, he stressed on how the drop-out rate among children in schools across the state had substantially reduced since the introduction of the mid-day meal scheme. Karnataka''s literacy rate stands at 67 per cent and the government''s goal was to take it to 85 per cent in the next two years, he said.

Expressing concern over the lack of quality teachers in schools and colleges, specially engineering colleges, he said ""If we have to keep pace with the changing world, we have to upgrade engineering college infrastructure and upgrade knowledge of teachers.""

Saying engineering professors were difficult to hire these days as they took up jobs with MNCs, he said: ""The state and Union government will have to find a solution to this problem.""

Putting a ceiling on further opening of new engineering colleges was not the solution, he said. ""We want more engineering colleges. If basic degree in engineering is not available, we can''t roll out teachers in vacuum,"" he said.

14,Trinamul leaders protest against attack on MLA,"KOLKATA: Senior Trinamul Congress leaders at a public meeting in support of party MLA Nirmal Mandal at Sonarpur in South 24 Parganas on Wednesday lambasted the law and order situation in the state.

Mandal was attacked by alleged CPM supporters last Sunday when he had gone to intervene in favour of a party supporter in a dispute involving a pond, Trinamul spokesman Partha Chattopadhyay said. He was now undergoing treatment at SSKM Hospital.

â€œWhen an opposition MLA can be beaten up by in Union minister Mamata Banerjeeâ€™s own constituency, that too in a place less than 30 kms from Kolkata, it is well imaginable what is the fate of common people who do not follow the line of the CPM living in far-flung villages of West Bengal,â€� opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee said.

The attack on Mandal was yet another issue that would be added to the list of issues on which the party had decided to call a Bangla bandh on February 3, Chattopadhyay said. The main issue behind the bandh call was the plan to impose a host of taxes at the panchayat level.

During the day, a number of street corner meetings were organised by the Trinamul in Kolkata and the suburbs in support of the bandh call. On Thursday, the Youth Trinamul Congress would organise a procession from Sealdah station to Howrah station in support of the bandh.
