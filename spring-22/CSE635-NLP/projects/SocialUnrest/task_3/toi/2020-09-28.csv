3,Services stuck with archaic rules,"KOLKATA: For those who had formulated travel rules for the defence forces, the figure 1,450 seems to hold a special fascination. For, that is the maximum distance a service officer is allowed to travel on leave, with free conveyance allowance.

Under the travel rules, an officer proceeding on annual leave can avail of a warrant for self and his or her family, irrespective of the distance, only once in two years. In the other year, the officer and family are entitled to free conveyance only within the limit â€” 1,450 km. However, most officers, especially those on â€œfieldâ€� postings, have to travel much farther than the maximum limit to reach home, officers in Kolkata say.

For a long time after Independence, officers were allowed free conveyance only till 950 km. This was among the British legacies that the defence forces inherited. The 950-km norm, then prevailing in Britain, had been enforced in India during the Raj without any consideration for the local conditions. According to information available from the British deputy high commission in Kolkata, the maximum distance in the UK, lengthwise, is just under 1,000 km while breadthwise it is about 500 km.

The Indian think tank increased the distance limit to 1,450 km well after Independence.

But even this is hard on an officer who has to travel, say, from Jammu to Kanyakumari (3,750 km) or Guwahati to Trivandram (3,580 km). â€œMost officers prefer to go to their home towns on leave as they have to stay away for long periods,â€� an officer says.

â€œThere is an anomaly here. Officers posted near their home town are at an advantage but those who stay faroff suffer,â€� another officer says.

4,Power pinch during Pujas,"KOLKATA: Over two dozen pujas in the city consume in excess of 100 kw of electricity every day during the Durga Puja â€” enough to suffice for an average household for six months!

Some households could run an entire year on the 185 KW of electricity that the puja at College Square consumes everyday. The next biggest, Maddox Square, consumes 150 KW while Ekdalia Evergreen consumes 135 KW.

The electricity bills of these top consumers also make interesting reading. In 2002, College Square coughed up a whopping Rs 90,000, Maddox paid Rs 70,000 and Ekdalia paid Rs 66,000.

CESC, the cityâ€™s power utility has assessed the peak hour power requirement during Pujas at 1,285 MW. That is a rise of 4 MW hike against the consumption by the 2,539 applicants last year.

Though CESC has assured uninterrupted power supply in the city and its adjoining areas during the Pujas, following an assurance of unrestricted power supply by the state electricity board during the crucial first week if October. CESC will generate about 1,000 MW, sourcing the rest from the SEB.

The only cause of concern though are rains. â€œDespite the raised the pillar boxes in the lowlying areas, rains may lead to faults.We will, however, be ready to restore faults at short notice,â€� said CESC executive director (distribution) D.N. Majumdar.

He, however, did not forsee any major faults. â€œWe have installed 12 transformers recently and the rate of low and high tension faults has declined,â€� he said, adding that 6,000 CESC employees would be on duty, monitoring the power situation during the festivities.

Nearly 223 mobile emergency vans fitted with wireless sets will patrol the streets round-the-clock to detect and repair faults.

CESC officials will also be present at the fire brigade headquarters and the Calcutta Police control room to tackle any emergency.

6,Vote bank politics put education on backseat,"NEW DELHI: What is more important, civic amenities for illegal colonies or upgradation of educational infrastructure for those studying in Municipal Corporation-run schools? If you are a politician facing the prospect of an election, the former stands true.

State urban development minister A K Walia has suggested that plan funds amounting to Rs 27 crore earmarked for education be â€˜â€˜divertedâ€™â€™ for upgrading civic amenities in unauthorised colonies. The prime movers behind the â€˜â€˜suggestionâ€™â€™ are the MLAs of the ruling party. The justification for this diversion is that last year the MCD could not manage to spend the entire amount.

â€˜â€˜Last year, against an outlay of Rs 112 crore, MCD only managed to spend Rs 70 croreâ€™â€™, said Waliaâ€™s letter. However, MCD commissioner Rakesh Mehta has not been keen to do this. â€˜â€˜We have initiated too many projects in education like building of 1,200 porta cabins to replace tented schools this year,â€™â€™ he said. Mehta has now asked for a meeting on Thursday to decide whether the financial jugglery required for the move will be worth it.

The high court had earlier pulled up the MCD for not spending enough on education after a PIL alleging this had been filed. â€˜â€˜If this fund diversion happens, it will be difficult to justify the matter to the court as well. This is plainly a move to do with elections,â€™â€™ said an official in the urban development department. Dr A K Walia was unavailable for comment.

A division Bench, comprising Chief Justice B C Patel and Justice A K Sikri, directed the survey commissioner of the Central Wakf Council to file a report within two-and-a-half months.

The direction came during the hearing of a PIL filed by an NGO, Hum Aap Ke, which alleged misappropriation of the income of the holy shrine by the pirzadas and their agents. In the petition filed through counsel M T Siddique, the NGO requested the court to recommend the government to enact a law on the lines of Ajmer (Khawaja Gharib Nawaz) Act for the medieval dargah.

The NGO pointed out the handsome income of the dargah was being appropriated by individuals who claimed to be related to Khusrau and Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia.

Gada had accused Hrithik and his father Rakesh Roshan of violating certain contract between them regarding merchandising of his films. Ashok Mundargi and Dipesh Mehta representing the Roshans maintained that a civil dispute was being given the colour of a criminal case and hence the magistrate order should be quashed.

11,Vajpayee govt pseudo patriotic: Sonia,"BIRSINGHPUR: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Vajpayee government at the Centre for being ''pseudo patriotic'' and ""responsible for rampant corruption and frequent threats to national security.""

Alleging that NDA government''s policies were ""responsible for the plight of farmers, workers, youths, tribals and other weaker sections in the society"", she asserted that Congress alone was capable of governing the country ""due to its commitment to social unity, far-sightedness and dedication.""

""Corruption is rampant under the BJP-led government. It has leaders, indulging only in fulfilling their self-interests and they can never be regarded as true patriots,"" Gandhi said, addressing a public meeting after laying the foundation stone for 500 mw thermal power plant here to be built at a cost of Rs 2,066 crore.

In a scathing attack on the centre, the Congress president alleged that the country''s security was being threatened frequently under the government which makes tall claims about patriotism and good governance.

""Desh bhakti, suraj aur swaraj ki baat karne wali sarkar ke raj mein desh ki suraksha bar bar khatre mein padi hai,"" she said.

Stating that a ''Mahabharat'' was on between BJP and Sangh Parivar Organisations, Gandhi claimed that many people were dreaming of becoming the prime minister.

12,MKVDC employees gherao minister,"PUNE: Employees of the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) on Monday gheraoed Harshavardhan Patil, state minister for marketing and employment guarantee scheme, to protest against non payment of salaries for two months.

Patil was gheraoed when he came to the MKVDC headquarters at Sinchan Bhavan for a meeting of the Mutha right bank canal advisory committee. MKVDC employees have not received salaries for August and September despite the fact that the cash strapped state government has made budgetary allocations of Rs 300 crore for paying salaries of MKVDC employees and those working in Tapi, Godavari, Vidarbha and Konkan irrigation development corporations.

Patil immediately contacted A K D Jadhav, chief finance secretary who assured the minister that the salary file would be cleared in a day and that the employees would receive their payments in two days.

Tempers ran high as MKVDC employees told the minister that they have reached the end of their tether.

""The government has financial difficulties only when it comes to paying our salaries. Employees in the secretariat get their salaries in advance,"" an employee remarked. Another added that they got salary for one month after waiting for two or three months and it was getting impossible to run their homes.

""We have been suffering this harassment since the past two years,"" he added.

Patil assured the employees that he would raise the issue during the meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday. ""Since the government has made budgetary allocations there should not be any delay in salary payment,"" he observed.

Ramesh Agavne, chairman of the coordination committee of irrigation and public works department employees told the minister that the delay was caused due to bureaucratic red tape.

""The salary file has to travel via 21 tables in various departments and it takes at least a month to complete all these procedures,"" he stated. He urged Patil to shorten the salary sanctioning process so that the employees get salaries in time.

Approximately Rs 47 crore are required for paying salaries of employees of all the five corporations, Agavne stated. Patil pointed out that the amount was smaller considering that the government spent Rs 1800 crore on salaries. Agavne also demanded that payment of salaries should not be linked to collection of money through the MKVDC bonds as the bonds were meant for completing the projects and not for raising money for salaries.

13,Transport fare to increase after Pujas,"KOLKATA: From October 10, bus and taxi fares in West Bengal will revert to the pre-May rates Rs 3 for public buses, Rs 3.50 for minibuses and Rs 15 for taxis.

State transport minister Subhash Chakraborty on Monday announced the increase following a meeting of the Left Front to discuss the issue. The minister ruled out any roll-back in road tax or motor vehicle fees, as demanded by transport operators.

A decision has been taken at a Left Front meeting. The new fares will be effective from October 10. There was a reduction in fares in June after a drop in fuel prices. Now that fuel prices have gone up, the operators will be allowed to revert back to the fares fixed in April. New fare charts are being prepared by the motor vehicles department, Chakrabarty said.

He assured the Front partners to place a comprehensive report after the Pujas on the impact of fuel prices, its incidence on transport operators and passengers.

The SUC rubbished the ministerâ€™s plea for the fare increase. There has been a rise in diesel prices all over the country. But no state has revised fares as yet apparently because the current price is still below what it was in 2002. But the announced fare structure is well above the 2002 rates, said SUC secretary Prabhas Ghosh.

While some transport operators felt that the increase in fares was long awaited, others claimed that the government had gone back on its word on taxes and fees. They threatened to launch an agitation soon after the Pujas.

The minister had promised that fares would be increased as soon as fuel prices go up. We had also demanded a decrease in fees, taxes and fines which have gone up manifold since April. The government has done nothing about these., threatened Tapan Banerjee of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.

Chakrabarty, however, said that road taxes and fees were the least in West Bengal. The increase in taxes and fees will cost the operators a paise per passenger per day. This will not bring down their earnings by much, he pointed out.

We are against the minimum fare of Rs 3. Short distance passengers will prefer to travel by auto-rickshaws than by bus if minimum fares are not kept down, said Swarna Kamal Saha of the Bengal Bus Syndicate.

14,Janaspandana an election gimmick: Siddaramaiah,"BANGALORE: Janata Dal (Secular) President Siddaramaiah on Sunday termed Chief Minister S M Krishna''s forthcoming Janaspandana (public contact) programme an election gimmick.

Participating in a press meet jointly organised by the Press Club of Bangalore and the Bangalore Reporters'' Guild, Siddaramaiah said: ``If Krishna had responded to the problems of people during these four years, we would not have attributed any motives. But with elections scheduled for next year, the timing of this programme is suspect.""

Castigating the government for being unresponsive to the prevailing drought situation, Siddaramaiah said: ``There has been no sincere effort by the CM or his colleagues to understand the situation. They have not bothered to visit these areas. As a last minute gesture, some of the ministers went by helicopter to oversee drought relief work just before the legislature session.""

Ridiculing the government''s Rs 880-crore farmer relief package announced by the government, Siddaramaiah termed it a package of bogus promises. ``Many of the interest and loan waivers they have announced are those which they had no hope of recovering anyway. So it is not of any benefit to the farmer at the present moment,"" he said.

He was also highly critical of the government''s handling of the spate of suicides by farmers. ``The CM visited the family of just one farmer, that too because it was his constituency. Just over 70 families have received help, while more than 400 have died. The fact that suicides have not stopped even after the announcement of the package is an indication that there is nothing in it for the farmers,"" he pointed out.

15,Don't commit suicide: CM's plea to farmers,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S M Krishna on Monday appealed again to farmers to desist from committing suicide and expressed his appreciation of the work done by organisations to ease the situation.

Addressing a gathering of Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation employees here, Krishna said: ""We should have grit in our soul to face this third year of drought. We should swim, both with and against the current and still win. If I die and go up -- I do not know where I will go -- who will wipe the tears and handle the problems faced by my wife and children? Are we born as human beings only to commit suicide?""

Krishna contended that everyone in the society had to make an effort to create awareness among farmers and prevent suicidal tendencies. ``Pontiff Shivamurthy Murugarajendra of the Chitradurga math did a padayatra in Davangere to ease out the atmosphere of suicide. Recently we had a meeting with psychologists on how to deal with the situation. Everyone has to pitch it,"" he maintained.

18,"JD(S), Cong workers clash at Hunsur","MYSORE: Police resorted to lathicharge when Janata Dal(S) workers and supporters of a local Congress leader clashed over the possession rights of a building complex at Hunsur town owned by Jayaprakash Narayan trust.

It was said that JD(S) workers and local Congress leader Sundarâ€™s supporters clashed when the former tried to evacuate a shop possessed by Sundarâ€™s relative. Dy SP Mandanna who was present at the spot ordered the lathicharge to disperse the clashing people. At this moment some of Sundarâ€™s supporters allegedly caught hold of taluk JD(S) President T Ramakrishnegowda who was present at the spot and thrashed him making him to faint.

However, police intervened and rescued JD(S) leader, before being shifted him to Hunsur Hospital and later on to a private hospital at Mysore.

It was said that JD(S) workers and supporters of Sundar. who recently defected to the Congress, are at loggerheads for the past couple of months over the possession rights of the shopping complex owned by Jayaprakash Narayan trust founded by former minister Dr H L Thimmegowda and which is now headed by his wife.

While Sundar is trying to occupy a shop in the complex which has been handed over to his brother by him while he was the trust secretary, JD(S) workers and leaders contend that the former has no powers and rights over the shop as according to trust rules he ceases to hold the trustâ€™s secretary post after his quitting the JD(S).

JD(S) leaders said the trust rules are clear and all the powers on the allotment of shops or ownership are vested with the president.

19,Police say no to Hrithik's arrest till chargesheets filed,"MUMBAI: The police on Monday informed the Bombay high court that actor Hrithik Roshan, his filmmaker father Rakesh Roshan and grandfather J Omprakash would not be arrested till investigations are complete and a chargesheet is filed, if required, against them in six alleged cheating cases.

In view of this assurance given by public prosecutor Pravin Singhal, the HC disposed of six petitions filed by the trio seeking to quash a lower court order, which directed Khar police to probe cheating cases registered against them.

Jayantilal Gada of Popular Entertainment Network had complained that the Roshans and Omprakash had allegedly cheated him by violating certain film merchandising agreements between them.

Advocates Ashok Mundergi and Dipesh Mehta representing the Roshans maintained that a civil dispute was wrongly being treated as a criminal case. A division bench comprising Justice Ranjana Desai and Justice PV Kakade seemed to agree with their contention that the trio faced the threat of an imminent arrest.

The Roshans pleaded that they had terminated the agreements due to alleged breach of contract by Gada. Their contention was that the criminal complaints were bogus and that the FIR deserves to be quashed. However, AY Sakhare and Ashok Sarogi appearing for Gada contended that the HC had no jurisdiction to entertain the petitions at a premature stage and the investigations should continue.

Sakhare said the police could give a 48 hour advance notice before arresting the trio. But the prosecutor said any arrest would be made only after a chargesheet was filed. The court directed the Roshans and Omprakash to cooperate with the investigations.

Gada alleged that his company had spent crores of rupees in creating a market for Hrithik, but the Roshans had backed out of the contract and started dealing with parties directly. The high court had earlier through a series of orders since July 23, 2003, restrained the police from arresting the trio till September 29.
