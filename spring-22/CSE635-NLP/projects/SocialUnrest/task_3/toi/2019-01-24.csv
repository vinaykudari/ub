0,Form national govt to fight terrorism: Bitta,"mumbai: congress leader and former punjab minister m.s. bitta on tuesday castigated all political parties, including his own, for their lackadaisical approach towards the issue of terrorism and went on to demand a national government that could find a way out of the current deadlock between india and pakistan. ""from a proxy war in punjab and jammu and kashmir, pakistan-backed terrorists have now come to attack parliament and, on tuesday, they attacked the american center in kolkata. political parties in the country are still not united on the issue of terrorism. how long are we going to behave like this as a nation?"" he asked. mr bitta said at a press conference here that he could not care if his party suffered electorally or otherwise because of his views on terrorism. ""i apprised my party leadership about my views on the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) and terrorism. but there was no response,"" said the former president of the indian youth congress who has now floated the all-india anti-terrorism front. however, he insisted that politics had nothing to do with his position on terrorism. ""my views on terrorism are a decade-old,"" added mr bitta, who has been the target of several terrorist attacks in the past. he said there was no use getting back gangster dawood ibrahim from pakistan unless india had anti-terrorism laws stronger than poto. ""even if dawood and others are brought back and tried under the normal laws, they could be released by the courts like several other terrorists in punjab were,"" he said. ""the centre is asking pakistan for dawood but has the maharashtra government convened an all-party meeting on the issue?"" he asked, lamenting that there was no political consensus on the issue of terrorism. he noted that terrorism could be tackled by the police in punjab. ""we should suspend all political activities for a year and tackle only terrorism. the president should form a national government to find a way out of the war-like situation between india and pakistan today. this government should enact a special law against terrorism and set up courts which will decide the case in four months,"" he said. mr bitta said that as the u.s. was leading a war against global terrorism, india should ask for the 200-odd punjab terrorists allegedly based in the u.s., the uk and australia. he also appealed to the centre to press for the repatriation of v. prabhakaran, chief of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam, now that a new government has taken charge in colombo. the ltte is allegedly responsible for the killing of rajiv gandhi. mr bitta has appointed daljit singh bal as president of the anti-terrorism front in mumbai. ""we will hold a camp, which will be attended by 10,000-odd people, in jammu and kashmir and addressed by defence minister george fernandes, among others."" he said that the front would also ask persons like julio rebeiro and k.p.s. gill, who were both directors general of police in punjab during the height of militancy, former chief election officer t.n. seshan, special inspector-general kiran bedi, among others to deliver lectures on terrorism at these camps.

1,HC asks govt to regulate nurses' transfer,"patna: a division bench of the patna high court comprising chief justice ravi s dhavan and justice s k singh on wednesday directed the bihar government to regulate the transfer of nurses on the pattern of doctors. government servants are generally posted at a place for a period of three years. hearing a letters patent appeal by anju lata das and others against the dismissal of their petition by justice s n jha, the division bench observed that the question of stay on their transfer after they served so long at one place did not arise. the bench noted that nurses are also government servants as much as doctors and are subject to the same policy of transfer from one place to another except for the cases when they are appointed on non-transferable posts. cbi rebuked: the division bench rebuked the cbi on tuesday for submitting its progress report on probe into the scam relating to purchase of substandard seeds and gi pipes under sealed covers without signature on the document. none of the two copies of the report for the two judges had a signature on it. the judges were also not satisfied with the sketchy report. cbi counsel rakesh kumar expressed his profuse regret over the slip. the court ordered that the regret of kumar be recorded and a more detailed signed report be submitted.

3,CITU leaderâ€™s protest meet at Israeli firm invites arrest,"visakhapatnam: the centre for indian trade union (citu) has demanded that the state government clarify if it has given a written assurance to an israeli diamond polishing unit in visakhapatnam export processing zone (vepz) that trade unions would not be permitted to function in these units. the management of the polishing unit claims that it has a written assurance from the government. the citu has termed any such assurance as illegal. the citu is presently locked up in a tussle with the management of diamond polishing unit named world class diamond international private limited. gajuwaka police have taken citu national secretary k hemalatha into custody for violating section 144 and conducting meeting at the unit office. malkapuram police stopped hemalatha's car while she was on her way to station from vepz to board godavari express. police kept her in the station till 7 p.m. and released later. about 35 employees of two diamond cutting units and 10 citu activists were arrested for breaking the law, police said. the employees of two diamond cutting units struck work last month demanding implementation of labour laws and minimum wages for them. we have a weekly holiday on saturday like in israel. and if it is festival day in israel, we will be given holiday here, employees told reporters here on wednesday. about 13 christians were sacked for applying leave on christmas last month. there was no holiday for sankranti festival. the police action has invited criticism from the citu which said it would intensify agitation against the firm's management. the congress, cpi (m), mcpi and cpi (ml) new democracy on wednesday announced their support to citu. they propose to organise a massive rally from old gajuwaka on january 25, demanding lifting of section 144. meanwhile, the representatives of the world class diamond international private limited reportedly met chief minister n chandrababu naidu at hyderabad on tuesday and appraised him of the disturbance created by some trade unions.

5,"Aim at integrated development, bankers told","shimla: banks in himachal pradesh had disbursed rs 418.83 crore under various credit schemes, in the first half of the year ending september. this was 55 per cent of the annual target of rs 764.79 crore for the current financial year. this was revealed at the 87th state-level bankers' committees meeting held here on wednesday, which was presided over by chief secretary harsh gupta. the bankers were lauded for the excellent progress under the kisan credit card scheme and micro credit in the state. addressing the bankers, harsh gupta said development institutes, banks and the state government should join hands and put in concerted efforts to create an integrated development model, as per the needs of the changing times. ''tourism, transport, information technology and it-related services have a vast potential in the state and the banks could also look into human resources development, to create a pool of skilled entrepreneurs,'' he added. he said priority sector advances in the state had increased to rs 1,712 crore, showing an increase of rs 324 crore over the corresponding period last year. agriculture and horticulture have been the backbone of himachal's economy and bankers should look into their credit portfolio to correct the uneven growth in various sectors, he added. gupta said the banking industry, besides fulfilling its financial and economic responsibilities, should shoulder social responsibilities entrusted to it and stressed upon the need for promoting small-scale industries in the state. more credit advancement in this sector would generate self-employment opportunities and contribute to the growth of the economy, he added.

7,Nominees violate code of conduct of polls,"faridkot: candidates of different political parties may accuse one another of flouting the election code, but at least on one pointâ€”the show of strength at the time of filing nominations â€” all seem to have agreed not to object. notwithstanding the condition, ''not more than three vehicles in a convoy,'' imposed by the election commission, many candidates were accompanied by more than 500 vehicles in faridkot district at the time of filing their nominations. while mantar singh brar, sad (b) candidate from kot kapura constituency of the district was accompanied by 600 vehicles when he filed his papers on monday, dissident akali candidate kartar sikhanwala headed a caravan of about 700 vehicles on wednesday. instead of objecting to this blatant violation of the model code of conduct, congress candidate vibha sharma seemed to have made it a point to outshine her opponents. she led a motorcade of about 800 cars, jeeps and vans on wednesday when she started for jaitu to file her nomination. similar was the state of affairs in faridkot constituency where congress and sad(b) are neck and neck. both their candidates vied with each other in their show of strength at the time of filing nominations. both avtar singh brar (congress) and kushaldeep singh dhillon led convoys of several hundred vehicles.

8,Sena infighting hits its prospects in PMC polls,"pune: one clear fall-out in pune of the intra-party squabbles in the shiv sena is the deliberate exclusion of mla deepak paigude, a staunch and powerful supporter of the sena chief's nephew, from all bodies involved with preparations for the pmc polls. rambhau parikh, city unit president of shiv sena, however, played down any concerted move to clip the wings of paigude. all his men who have chances of wresting a seat have been given tickets, he said. notwithstanding this assertion, paigude, a two-time mla from bhavanipeth assembly segment of the city, appears to have been literally pushed to political oblivion by the uddhav thackeray group. firstly, paigude's close associates were unceremoniously removed from crucial positions in the local party machinery. laments a close confidante of paigude, at least two shakha pramukhs and a women's cell chief owing allegiance to paigude were quietly replaced in the last one year. recently, paigude was once again humiliated when his followers were either denied tickets for civic polls or asked to contest from wards having tough competition. for example, baba wagaskar's claim for a ticket to a seat in the koregaon park-mundhwa panel was outright rejected by the parliamentary board. another supporter ravindra dhangekar, a relative newcomer, was asked to compete against a congress veteran, buwa nalawade, with full knowledge that he stood a very slim chance of winning. as a result of the vindictive tactics, paigude has been forced to maintain a low profile. in fact, the bhavani peth legislator stayed away from the launch of his party's civic election campaign last week. the rally had all senior sena leaders, including subhash desai and district in-charge ravindra mirlekar, besides shivajinagar mla vinayak nimhan. given the fact that paigude had done a lot of spadework to consolidate the party base in pune, attempts to derail him from the mainstream decision-making process can be attributed only to his proximity with raj thackeray. observers feel paigude's marginalisation would definitely upset the rank and file of the party unit in pune. although nobody would say anything openly against the raw deal being meted out to paigude, unhappiness amongst workers might effect the campaigning and finally the poll results, said the sena observer. the sena's pune-unit chief rambhau parikh said there was no question of the sena spoiling its chances because of the infighting as raj thackeray himself had agreed to address election rallies in pune. as far as internal problems are concerned, almost every party is confronted with such issues, added parikh.

9,Electronic media ban total for polls: EC,"pune: the use of websites and e-mails for the civic poll campaign has been explicitly banned by the state election commission (ec). the directive comes as a jolt to three software companies from pune which had launched special websites dedicated to the campaign. replying to a clarification sought by pmc election officer rajendra nimbalkar, state election commissioner bhalchandra veer confirmed that not just private television and radio channels, but all types of electronic media, including websites, e-mails and messaging through pagers and mobile telephones, had been banned for campaigning purposes. the directive has saddened the three software companies which had launched websites for the campaign, but they are not planning to challenge the directive in the courts. we have closed our website, said umesh deshmukh of ujwal software, which had launched punepoll.com for the polls in pune and pimpri-chinchwad. the internet is the most effective and cheap method of communication. it is tragic that in the era of information and technology, the ec has issued such a directive. in its directive, the ec had justified the ban arguing that not all candidates could afford the cost of election campaign through electronic media. deshmukh countered this argument pointing out that the campaign through internet and websites was much cheaper than campaigning through traditional modes such as taking out processions and erecting banners and cut-outs. sanjay daga, managing director of suraj info.com, which has launched a website, surajinfo.com, for the pmc and pimpri-chinchwad civic polls, also upheld this argument pointing out that the website had planned to charge just rs 500 per candidate for displaying the photographs of the civic works accomplished by the candidate. daga pointed out that the media and civic activists often criticise the new generation for not showing an interest in the civic polls. the low turnout of educated voters on the day of polling is also often lamented. and now, when we are dedicating our website to the civic elections and helping attract the youth to participate in the poll process comes this directive of the ec, he lamented.

11,Govt cracks down on protesters in Kutch,"gandhinagar/ahmedabad: the district administration in kutch on wednesday cracked down heavily on about 1,300 agitating quake-affected people sitting on dharna in front of the taluka development offices of rapar, bhachau and anjar to demand the early release of housing compensation. the swoop down was aimed at crushing protests on the eve of the first anniversary of the quake when world attention will again be turned to the quake-hit district. police removed the protesters' tents, cut electricity, took away microphones even threw away drinking water meant for those sitting on dharna. on instructions from the collectorate's office in bhuj, the police asked people to vacate the place, with threats having been issued on putting the local leaders behind bars under pasa. even as such harsh steps were being taken in kutch ahead of the completion of one year of the quake, in what can be called a carrot-and-stick policy, the gujarat government on wednesday decided to finally look into the problem of thousands of people who have been left without any housing compensation because no housing assessment has taken place. a senior government official told tnn on wednesday, ""the cases of about 1,000 such people in rapar and as many in anjar are being initially cleared. the process of clearing others' cases too would start soon."" officials admitted the problem is particularly acute for those whose houses had collapsed in the quake but have no residence proof, or were not paying any panchayat tax. many lived for decades on unauthorised village land. ""while for the urban areas a clear-cut government resolution was issued for paying housing compensation for even those houses which did not have a residence proof, no such gr was issued for the village panchayat areas. this was the crux of the problem,"" said a top bureaucrat. ""the result was that thousands of people in kutch and saurashtra were just left out."" but with the agitation having picked up, the government has finally woken up to the problem and has started gathering facts and thinking of streamlining the whole issue. according to a spokesperson of the lok adhikar manch, under whose banner the protests are on in rapar, bhachau and anjar talukas, there are nearly 20 per cent of such cases in the rural areas where ""no assessment has taken place as the villagers do not have residence proof or were ostensibly staying on unauthorised land."" despite the district administration's crackdown, the spokesperson told tnn on phone from rapar that about 250 people had decided to stay in the open and continue with their agitation against the ""refusal"" of the government to pay them housing compensation. in rapar on wednesday, about 700 agitating people belonging to 53 villages were witness to the crackdown, while in bhachau and anjar 300 people each faced the wrath of the administration. ""when the lok adhikar manch went to represent before collector h n chibber about the harsh manner in which the agitationists were being treated, he said, he knew what he was doing and there was no point in agitating over a non-issue,"" the spokesperson said. chibber is believed to have received instructions from gandhinagar to ensure against any protest at least for a week till the international and national media loses interest in the one-year of quake in kutch.

""in the morning, the police came here and threatened the locals. they forced the person who had rented the mandap to remove it and they spilled the water from the containers, too"" says prasad chacko of the manch. chief executive officer of the rapar area development authority pl darbar, however, does not see any basis in the dharna. ""there does not seem to be any basis in their fight. there have no specific demand. the same families are seeking more help and change of category,"" he says. it seems that like the dreadful night of january 26, 2001, even on january 26, 2002, most kutchis will sleep under the open sky. the major distinction would be of course that last year they were victims of nature's fury. but this year they will be victims of societal ill-will, a system, which we have created and to which we will re-commit ourselves on the republic day.

21,â€˜Most youngsters unaware of civic electionsâ€™,"new delhi: here is a sampling of public opinion on the mcd polls. shobha, a retired government servant and a resident of civil lines: the campaign to get the polls deferred on the issue of a separate corporation for the trans-yamuna at the fag end of the term is unwarranted. people think it is politically motivated. since both the parties had this issue in their manifesto earlier, why did they not take it up then? the work done by bjp in general is satisfactory, but delayed elections might affect their prospects. rajesh sharma, resident of bali nagar and a garments trader in karol bagh: the whole mcd poll is a wasteful exercise as far as the new generation is concerned. how many youngsters know about it? and why should they? when the councillors cannot serve the residents, why should they be elected? we want development in its true sense and not just elections at regular intervals for mps, mlas and councillors. prabhat shukla, a government servant and a resident of a patparganj housing society: it is often confusing for the voters as to who is being elected and which poll it is, because local body elections are not as significant as the lok sabha polls. even then, whoever comes to power in mcd, certain issues must be dealt with. major among them are sanitation, education and public health. experience shows that mcd has failed mostly on these accounts. mohammed omar, a businessman at the kirti nagar timber market: the mcd poll result may create history in kirti nagar. so far it has been a bjp domain with mp, mla and mlc all from bjp. this time equations may change and that would be a history.
