0,SGPC polls: Non-aligned members suffer setback,"PATIALA: The seven-member committee of the 21 non-aligned Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) members led by Mal Singh Ghumman and Hardip Singh Mohali faced a major setback on Wednesday when one of its members Dhian Singh Jhharmali disassociated himself from the committee alleging that some anti-panthic forces were working behind the scene.It is worthwhile to note that a senior leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) and former Punjab minister Ajaib Singh Mukhmailpur along with some other leaders organised a special interview of Dhian Singh with a news channel at a small village under Nagal police station near Ambala in Haryana on Wednesday.Sources said that Dhian Singh claimed that he was forcibly given the police security while he never demanded it and somehow he managed to escape from the security to tell his story.He said that the committee met Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Simranjit Singh Mann and Surjit Singh Barnala but did not meet the SAD (B) chief Parkash Singh Badal. He said that Gurdip Singh, a member of the committee, was asked to arrange a meeting with Badal, which he never did, and without taking up the issue with Badal, they started discussing the names of the prospective candidates.Saying that he opposed their stance, Dhian Singh added that the panel was formed to bring the whole panth on one platform but nobody bothered and so he decided to disassociate himself from it.He said the forces responsible for the Operation Blue Star were behind all this which wanted to destruct the community.Ajaib Singh Mukhmailpur said that as per an agreement between Gurcharan Singh Tohra and the Congress, Tohra had extended support to the Congress to ensure the defeat of the SAD (B). Now, the Congress was extending its support to Tohra to install him as president of the SGPC, he added.

2,SGPC elections will be free and fair: Amarinder,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, on Wednesday, said he would ensure that the elections to the post of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president and its executive, on November 12, are conducted in a free and fair manner.

He asserted that nobody would be permitted to vitiate the SGPC polls.

Addressing reporters here on Wednesday, Amarinder Singh clarified that the police would not stop any SGPC member from participating in the elections at the Teja Singh Samundari Hall at the Golden Temple Complex, nor would it obstruct the movement of devotees on poll day.

However, Amarinder added that the police would not permit thousands of supporters of SGPC members to storm the Golden Temple Complex, especially the venue of the SGPC meeting.

The police would be ready to meet any eventuality, he added.

According to reports, former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal has urged SAD members to turn up in large numbers at the Golden Temple Complex Complex, a few days before the elections, to foil any attempt by the Amarinder Singh government â€˜â€˜to hijack the elections with the help of the policeâ€™â€™.

Amarinder had alleged in the past that Badal had kidnapped SGPC members at his farmhouse in Balasar in Haryana. However, he conceded that none of the allegedly detained membersâ€™ relatives had approached the government to affect a rescue.

â€˜â€˜My information about the SGPC membersâ€™ detention against their will is limited to newspaper reports,â€™â€™ Amarinder added. On the other hand, the seven-member panel headed by former SGPC general secretary Mal Singh Ghuman has deferred its decision on announcing its consensus candidate for the post of SGPC president. After a meeting of the panel at Mohali, Ghuman said that the committee had given Badal a two-day ultimatum to fall in line and make an honest effort for the selection of a consensus candidate or face defeat and the wrath of the Sikh community.

Ghuman said that the panel would try to meet Badal, on Thursday, at Alamgir Gurdwara at Ludhiana where he is to meet the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) of the SAD. â€˜â€˜This would be our last attempt to persuade Badal not to press for his partyâ€™s nominee and instead support a neutral consensus candidate.â€™â€™ Badal has already rejected Ghumanâ€™s proposal and expelled him from the partyâ€™s primary membership.

4,Landlords arrested for failure to report rent deals,"MUMBAI: The Navi Mumbai policeâ€™s recent arrests of 30-odd landlords and real-estate agents for failing to report rental deals have sparked a rush of brokers to local police stations.

Navi Mumbai police commissioner Ramrao Ghadge had issued a notification on October 1 stating that new tenants could be taken in only after getting No Objection Certificates from the police.

He said that the police over the last few weeks have received 181 applications for finalising rental deals. â€œAfter the arrests, people have realised that we are serious about the order,â€™â€™ Mr Ghadge said.

Those found guilty of failing to notify the police could face up to six months imprisonment or a fine of Rs 1,000 or both.

Manohar Shroff, secretary of the Brokers Association of Vashi, said the arrests have prompted real-estate agents approach the police. With the police taking action, no one wants to be in the wrong side of the law, he said. Many people had bought flats in this satellite town as an investment. Most of these flats are rented out.

The police have said that the rental approvals are necessary to prevent antisocial elements and terrorists from finding accommodation in Navi Mumbai. â€œThis is a sensitive area and there are many vital installations here,â€™â€™ Mr Ghadge told this newspaper.

Mr Ghadge said real estate agents and landlords merely needed to register the name of their customers and that there was no paperwork involved. The police would conduct investigations only if there was anything suspicious about the deal, he added.

However, human rights activists and lawyers say that the police are being a bit too harsh. Jai Chinai, a senior advocate who specialises in property matters, said that high-handed actions such as arrests should be avoided. Many people are unaware of the law and it would have been sufficient to merely warn them, he said. â€œI do appreciate that this is being done in the interest of the people and we must cooperate with the police,â€™â€™ he added.

The Navi Mumbai police in July had asked landlords to report new tenants. This order was valid for two months. However, no one registered their deals, Mr Ghadge said. After that, the police held a meeting of brokers in Navi Mumbai to inform them about the notification, which was reissued in October.

This directive is valid till Novemberend. Mr Ghadge said the arrests were carried out only after sufficient awareness was created about the directive. But human rights activist P.A. Sebastian emphasised that the police directive could be easily misused. â€œThere are thousands of people who rent out premises in Mumbai. How will the police verify the antecedents of all of them?â€™â€™ he said. The police could use the directive arbitrarily and pick on people against whom they have a grudge, he suggested. Atul Shah, president of the Estate Agents Association of India, which has 1,000-odd members, said the police action was a step in the right direction.

â€œOften, we donâ€™t know anything much about our clients, so itâ€™s better that we inform the police,â€™â€™ Mr Shah added.

Former police commissioner Ronnie Mendonca said that people should first be made aware about the measure. In the initial stages, it would be better if arrests were carried out only after investigations proved a wilful attempt to withhold information, he added.

For instance, â€œIf during investigations, it is proved that the estate agents knew they were dealing with gangsters, then action should be taken,â€™â€™ he said. For mere violations, a warning or minor punitive action would suffice, he added.

6,Five arrested for role in surety racket,"MUMBAI: The Azad Maidan police have arrested five persons who allegedly appeared fake sureties to get bail for more than 100 undertrials, including several alleged gangsters, at the Esplande court.

A city advocate,who is the prime conspirator in the racket, is still to be arrested. The police refused to disclose his name. Those arrested are Pradeep Surve, Balu Shinde, Manoj Maurya, Zakaria Aga and Kishore Gurav. They have been remanded to police custody.

Their modus operandi was approach relatives of undertrials seeking sureties.

They prepared fake salary slips, identification cards, marriage certificates and other documents to pose as a genuine surety before the metropolitan magistrate. The sureties were filed by the advocate, who is now absconding,â€™â€™ said an officer.After being released, the undertrials paid huge amounts as fees to the lawyer.

Said a senior officer, â€œA surety is a deterrent for an undertrial to abscond. If he escapes, the court directs the police to arrest the person who gave his surety. But if the surety is bogus, it becomes difficult to catch the criminal.â€™â€™

The incident came to light when the Azad Maidan police rounded up two men, Aga and Gurav, for a petty offence on November 2. During interrogations, they revealed their involvement in furnishing fake identity cards, salary certificates and other documents required to procure bail orders.

7,Parties gear up for SGPC polls,"CHANDIGARH: The political climate in the state is hotting up over the annual election of president and executive of SGPC.

And all Akali factions, Sikh intellectuals, community outfits and even the Punjab government, specially chief minister Amarinder Singh, are out to derive political mileage from it.

The stakes are clearly high as it is believed that those controlling SGPC control Sikh politics.

And all have entered the race to gain control of the SGPC directly or by proxy.

While former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal is trying to retain control of SGPC and its resouces with his faction, former SGPC president GurcharanSingh Tohra and former speaker Ravi Inder Singh are determined to humble Badal on his own turf and have already triggered revolt in his camp.

To their advantage, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has given tacit support to them which is crucial in the number game where Badal is progressively losing ground.

The SAD-Bâ€™s strength in the SGPC, which was 120 at one time, has depleted.

With barely a week to go before the elections, the number game is going to get more tricky. Which is why all concerned are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the case of disqualification of 12 SGPC members pending before the Sikh Gurdwara Judicial Commission.

The battle lines are clearly defined. And there are daily gains and losses, too.

While Tarlochan Singh Dupalpur deserted Badal on Wednesday, Dhian Singh Jhharmali quit the seven-meber panel of former SGPC general secretary Mal Singh Ghuman.

All parties contesting the SGPC executive polls are ready to meet the worst. Apprehending the governmentâ€™s intervention, Badal has urged the party cadre to be present in large numbers at the Golden Temple complex a couple of days before the election.

To counter the move of Badal, Amarinder reiterated that he would ensure free and fair elections and none would be permitted to vitiate it.

To avoid any criticism on account of the â€˜â€˜governmentâ€™s interventionâ€™â€™, Amarinder clarified that the police would not stop any SGPC member on its way to participate in the SGPC elections but it wonâ€™t permit thousands of Badalâ€™s supporters to storm venue of the SGPC meeting either.

â€˜â€˜The police would be present to meet any eventuality,â€™â€™ he added.

Though Amarinder had alleged in the past that Badal had kidnapped SGPC members in his farm house in Balasar in Haryana, he conceded that none of the allegedly detained membersâ€™ relatives have approached the government to rescue them.

Meanwhile, the seven-members panel has deferred its decision on announcing its consensus candidate and given a twoday ultimatum to Badal to fall in line. Ghumman said the panel would try to meet Badal on Thursday to press for a consensus candidate. But Badal has rebuffed Ghummanâ€™s move by expelling him from primary membership of the party.

8,Cong clears candidates for Gujarat Assembly polls,"NEW DELHI: The Congress screening committee for Gujarat Assembly polls is understood to have cleared on Wednesday the names for 182 seats to be finalised by the party''s Central Election Committee here on November 12.

The Screening Committee, headed by senior leader Pranab Mukharjee, had two rounds of meeting today and is understood to have gone through more than 1,000 applications seeking to contest the assembly polls, party sources said.

AICC general secretary incharge of the state affairs Kamal Nath, senior Party leader P M Sasyeed, Gujarat PCC President Shankersinh Vaghela and CLP leader Amarsinh Chaudhary also participated in the process.

Earlier, talking to reporters after the first round, Kamal Nath had ruled out any alliance for Gujarat assembly elections but said the party was not averse to seat adjustments with like-minded political parties to take on BJP in the December 12 polls. ""We will not not form any front for these elections but there will be some seat adjustments"", he said.

The party has already decided to renominate all the 50- plus MLAs in the state.

Stating that talks were on with like-minded political parties including CPI-M, Samajwadi Party, NCP and Lok Janshakti headed by Ram Vilas Paswan, Vaghela said it was not not a must for these allies to put up candidates ""if they are serious about defeating BJP"".

However, unconfirmed sources said Congress was willing to concede about 10 seats for the like-minded political parties.

9,Cong slams govt on Krishna tribunal,"HYDERABAD: The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) has demanded that the government clarify as to whether or not the constitution of a new tribunal for Krishna water allocation was in the state''s interests.

Senior Congress leader M V Mysoora Reddy on Wednesday alleged that despite having one year''s time for conveying its response to Karnataka''s request for the new tribunal, the government was hurriedly taking steps to file its counter in the Supreme Court to escape from its responsibility of constructing new projects.

Criticising the government for its failure in taking political parties into confidence in sensitive issues like the Krishna water distribution, he demanded that the government explain the reasons which prompted it to request the Centre to constitute a new tribunal for the allocation of Krishna water.

""The government is only trying to enforce its views on other political parties by convening all-party meetings on the issue without providing the required information,"" he said. Reddy wanted chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu to explain as to how the new tribunal would help the state.

""The government is trying to skirt its responsibilities like taking up construction of new projects on the pretext of establishing a new tribunal. The government and the ruling party will have to take the responsibility if the new tribunal goes against the state''s interests. The Congress will never be a party to such decisions,"" Mysoora Reddy said.

To substantiate his claims, Mysoora Reddy quoted the Supreme Court judgments from time to time on the Krishna water issue and said that all the decisions of the apex court, including its acceptance of raising the height of Almatti dam were against the interests of the state.

""The issue is sensitive and it needs to be dealt at the level of the CM only. That is why the Congress preferred to abstain from the all-party meet convened by major irrigation minister K Srihari on Tuesday,"" he said. He also took exception to the ruling party''s criticism of Congress for abstaining from the meeting.

11,Decision on genetically modified mustard deferred,"NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday deferred a decision on the introduction of another genetically modified crop, the GM mustard, following a controversy and protests by several environmental groups.

After a meeting of the Genetically Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), the body which decides upon the introduction of GM crops, its chairman A M Gokhale told reporters here that the talks to decide upon the GM mustard remained ""inconclusive"" as some members of the committee wanted more time for data analysis and interpretation.

All the aspects from biological to human health issues need clarification and further investigation, he said, adding the detailed data was available with the government and the committee would take a ""hard look"" into the matter.

Gokhale said that there was a detailed presentation from the company Pro-Agro, but several ministries wanted further investigations before taking a final decision.

""Even our own secretariat want time for data analysis,"" he said. ""Discussions will continue in the next meeting which is likely to take place in two-four weeks.""

13,Govt pledges security for Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: Dispelling reports of confrontation between the home ministry and the Election Commission on the deployment of forces, the Centre on Thursday assured the EC that adequate forces would be made available ""in time"" for the Assembly polls in Gujarat.

The assurance was given by Union Home Secretary N Gopalaswami when he met Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh to review the availability of security forces for the Assembly polls.

15,Samata wants ministerial meet on divestment,"NEW DELHI: A day after the Samata Party, the BJP''s closest ally, openly attacked the government on the disinvestment issue, it stepped up pressure on the PM, wanting him to call a meeting of senior ministers before the November 18 Parliament session for a final view on the sale of oil PSUs.

On Wednesday, Samata Party spokesperson Shambhu Shrivastava, quoting from the party''s resolution adopted at its recent national executive meeting, had openly attacked the government for the procedures adopted in the disinvestment of PSUs, saying these had created misgivings among the people. Moreover, the alliance partner has called for a mid-term evaluation of the implementation of the NDA agenda, saying if necessary, corrective measures should be undertaken.

This is not the first time the Samata Party has raised the disinvestment issue. Two months ago, Samata Party president and defence minister George Fernandes objected to the disinvestment of oil PSUs. Consequently, the matter blew up into a major controversy which also showed serious divisions within the BJP and between the BJP and the RSS. The matter was kept on hold for three months, pending suggestions from all quarters.

This deadline expires on December 7, but Shrivastava said here on Thursday that the PM should take a decision sooner so that this issue is not kept hanging till the Parliament session. Samata Party leaders explained that since all the suggestions on this issue are now on the table, it is better to take a decision soon so that the NDA does not come across as a divided house during the winter session.

Although this is being cited as the ostensible reason for expediting a decision on the oil PSUs, the real reason, according to Samata Party sources, is that they had managed to mount sufficient pressure within the government on this matter and that it would be difficult for the NDA to show any preference to a particular corporate house.

Although the Samata party is the BJP''s closest ally with Fernandes having emerged as the PM''s main troubleshooter, realpolitik is forcing the party to dissociate itself from the NDA government''s style of functioning and its decisions. With the BJP''s popularity dipping gradually and disinvestment emerging as a controversial issue, it has become imperative for its allies to re-establish their own distinct identity and distance themselves from the NDA''s more unpleasant decisions. Samata Party leaders said there was a strong undercurrent among its cadres that any further association with the BJP will cost the party dearly in electoral terms.

Clarifying his party''s stand, Shrivastava said their objections did not mean the party was against disinvestment or privatisation per se. According to him, their objections were not dictated so much by economic parameters but by political sensitivities. He said there was a general perception among the people that the ""country was up or sale"" which, he said, needs to be corrected. Faced with several assembly elections, to be followed by the general election, he said they would have to pay a heavy political price if corrective measures are not taken.

16,EC to visit Gujarat ahead of polls,"NEW DELHI: Election Commission chief James Lyngdoh and his two fellow members, T S Krishnamurthy and B B Tandon have decided to go to Gujarat for a two-day visit on Monday, following a ""harmonious"" meeting here on Thursday with the Union home secretary on the issue of the secure conduct of polling.

The EC wants 400 companies (nearly 30,000 personnel) of central para-military forces in the riot-stricken state before the December 12 polls, with half going there now and the other half will move into position a week before the election. The Union home secretary told them at Thursday''s meeting that the first 200 companies have already been directed to proceed, and will be in place by November 22.

These 200 companies would be utilised ""for confidence building measures and for area domination in the core riot affected districts,"" the EC announced after the meeting, adding that reports in parts of the media about differences with the ministry were untrue.

Ministry sources, likewise, said ""at no stage"" had they ever told the Commission about any inability to supply the needed numbers. The EC, for that matter, said there had never been a problem in this regard in ""any"" election it had organised.

17,Kalmadi flays govt on AJT acquisition,"NEW DELHI: Congress Rajya Sabha member Suresh Kalmadi on Thursday accused the government of being ""penny wise, pound foolish"" and wavering on the purchase of advanced jet trainers (AJT) for the Indian Air Force.

Stating that over 150 aircraft worth Rs 10,000 crores had crashed and 60 pilots killed in the last five years, he asked: ""How many more aircraft must crash and how many more pilots must be killed before we have the promised AJT in place?""

Saying that revaluation of aircraft rejected earlier was ""a delaying tactic"", he asked Fernandes to identify the ""mysterious elements"" who were opposing the acquisition.

Himself a former fighter pilot and currently a member of the Parliament''s Standing Committee on Defence, Kalmadi ridiculed Fernandes convening a meeting on Friday to discuss air accidents. ""The government, like Hamlet, is vacillating: ''to be or not to be''.""

He said the committee headed by former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal La Fontaine had recommended the need for the AJT and said that the lack of it had led to many air accidents.

""Frequent recurrence of these crashes endangers the national security and highlights inadequacy of our training infrastructure. This unabated depletion of defence resources has an adverse and demoralising effect on the IAF, and the morale of the pilots is at an all time low.""

Over 125 MPs, from all political parties, had in a petition to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Defence Minister George Fernandes expressed concern about the delay in the acquisition of the AJT, but to no avail. The matter had come up in Parliament many times and the Standing Committee on Defence had on many occasions asked the government to act. Many IAF chiefs had stressed on the urgent need for having the AJTs, he said. Various courts of enquiry of the IAF have also stated that the cause of these accidents is due to non-procurement of the AJT, Kalmadi said.

18,Sebi hikes ceiling on MFs investment in foreign securities,"MUMBAI: Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has doubled the ceiling on investment by each mutual fund in foreign securities to 10 per cent of net assets as on March 31, 2002.

However, MFs would continue to be governed by the minimum of $5 million and a maximum of $50 million for each fund irrespective of size of their assets, Sebi said in a communication to asset management companies on Thursday.

Sebi sources said the move to double the ceiling was an outcome of a decision taken by High Level Committee on Capital Markets (HLC) in the last quarter while the overall investment limit for MFs put together at $500 million continued to remain in place.

Mutual funds, which have already received approvals from the Reserve Bank of India''s exchange control department should approach them once again for enhancement of the limits, Sebi added.

The MF regulations clause, which prohibits charging of fees, shall not be applicable to investments in mutual funds in foreign countries made in accordance with guideliness, Sebi said.

However, the management fees and other expenses charged by the mutual fund(s) in foreign countries and those charged to the domestic mutual fund scheme shall not exceed the total limits on expenses as prescribed under MF regulation, it said.

21,"SGPC polls: Badal, Tohra groups on lookout for 'easy meat'","BATHINDA: Getting control of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) executive, is apparently the only thing on the minds of both the Gurcharan Singh Tohra faction and the former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal group.

In this do-or-die scenario, the Tohra faction is reportedly trying to reel in rival group members, while the Badal group is desperately trying to keep its flock together. Not only this, the Badal group is also on the lookout for members who can be ""won over easily"".

At least 172 members are expected to vote in the SGPC polls on November 12. According to inside sources, both Badal and his opponents, enjoy the support of roughly 80 members each. That makes the remaining 10 to 12 members fair game for both the groups.

Since political pressure has so far yielded no results, sources said, the only lure that is expected to work is perhaps that of lucre.

In Bathinda, sources say, the promise of monetary gains, has already led two SGPC members into the Badal and Tohra camp, respectively. One of the two members is still said to be at Balasar farmhouse. A deal, sources say, has already been struck with the two members. Badal''s insecurity over the members'' loyalty is said to be the reason behind the move.

The rival group had reportedly been pressurising the members'' family at Bathinda.

Sources say, a member, who spoke of the ""penury"" in which he was living, managed to get the Badal group to promise him Rs 1.5 lakh.

The other member, who escaped from the Balasar farmhouse, has reportedly been lured by the rival group. The member escaped after a deal was struck with his family at Bathinda. The family managed to secure the member''s release from Badal''s ""captivity"", on the plea that he was needed to look after his ""ailing wife"". The member never returned to the Badal camp.

Going by reports, members who ""escaped"" from Badal''s ""captivity"" have either been lured by money or by threatening their families with dire consequences.

The number game appears to be getting the better of both the groups.

Whether they win or lose, will depend largely on the strategy adopted by the party in the next few days. Sources say, leaders from both the sides are apparently doing all they can to win over the support of at least seven SGPC members, who are expected to change loyalties or simply have not made their minds up.

After Kehar Singh Rathore and Tirlochan Singh Dupalpur escaped from Balasar and joined the Tohra group, MP Zora Singh Maan, who is said to be guarding Badal''s ""flock"" at the Balasar farmhouse, has reportedly seen to it that ""vulnerable"" members were shifted to Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala''s Ekant farmhouse.

22,Punjab govt reorganises education system,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has decided to reorganise and restructure the school education system. Stating this here on Thursday, secretary school education KK Bhatnagar said the reorganisation and restructuring of school education system was among the priorities of the Punjab government.

The four levels of school education namely, primary, middle, high and senior secondary had been restructured into two levels i.e. elementary and secondary level. The elementary level will consist of classes Ist to 8th and secondary level would consist of classes 9th to 12th.

Accordingly, the Directorate of Primary Education has now been rechristened as Directorate of Elementary Education to take care of classes upto 8th while the Directorate of School Education would henceforth be known as Directorate of Secondary Education and these had come into existence on Nov 1, 2002.

This would now be followed by rationalisation of teaching posts and with the the judicious redeployment of the teaching staff and infrastructure, the education system would now work more cohesively and efficiently.

Security to be beefed up for ministers: The Punjab government has directed the police to provide more security to the ministers both at their official as well as private residences.

Stating this here on Thursday, an government spokesman said this step was being taken after having noticed the inadequate security arrangements including the placement of security guards at the residences of the ministers.

The DGP Punjab and ADGP (Security) have been urged to strengthen the security arrangements and depute more guards within three days. Besides, all the deputy commissioners and SSPs have been asked to control the vehicular traffic and streamline other arrangements during the visit of the chief minister in their respective districts to save the public from being harassed. Normal traffic should be restored immediately after the movement of the fleet in minimum time.

23,'Congress to repeal casino law after coming to power',"CHANDIGARH: Haryana Congress president Bhajan Lal on Thursday said as and when the Congress was voted to power in the state, it would get the casino law repealed.

Bhajan Lal, who was speaking at a press conference after presiding over a meeting of the newly-constituted executive of the Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee(HPCC) here, also asked the companies, which had offered to set up casinos in the state, to think over the issue carefully before taking the plunge.

The Haryana Vidhan Sabha during its recent two-day special session passed the Casino Bill amidst noisy protests by the opposition which wanted the government to drop the Bill in the interest of common man. The state government is planning to allow casinos in Faridabad and Gurgaon areas bordering Delhi. The chief minister has been defending the government decision with the argument that casinos would help in generating additional revenue which would be utilised to improve education and health facilities in the state.

In reply to a question, former chief minister Bhajan Lal said a delegation of the Haryana Congress would soon meet party president Sonia Gandhi to urge her to persuade Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to complete Satluz-Yamuna Link Canal(SYL) as per the Supreme Court ruling.

If need be, Haryana Congress would not hesitate to file a contempt case against Punjab government, he added.

Asked if he has received the resignation of PCC vice-president Chiranji Lal Sharma, Bhajan Lal said neither he nor the central leadership of the party had received any resignation letter from Sharma so far. Sharma has reportedly resigned in protest against what he called uncalled for remarks made by Bhajan Lal against Brahmins during his recent Karnal visit. Bhajan Lal has, however, denied having made such remarks.

Ridiculing chief minister Chautala''s frequent foreign tours to attract foreign direct investment for the state, Bhajan Lal said what to talk of fresh investments, even the existing industrial houses had started shifting to other states due to unfavourable conditions created by the state government.

The industry in Haryana was highly agitated over the government decision to increase local area development tax from four to 10 per cent, said Lal adding that once this hike in tax came into force, the industry in Haryana would not be able to compete with units in other states.

He also criticised Chautala government for forcibly grabbing land at different places for setting up Devi Lal parks.

24,All-party forum opposes Empress mill closure,"NAGPUR: An all-party forum led by Rajya Sabha MP and Nationalist Congress Party leader Datta Meghe have opposed the closure of the 125-year-old Empress Mills even though a chunk of the land and some machinery has already been sold. While claiming on Thursday that chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had issued orders suspending the sale of the land and machinery of the mills, leaders belonging to the Congress as well as all other major parties here openly blamed state textile minister and city Congress MLA Satish Chaturvedi for the decision to close the mills.

The forum alleged that within days of announcing closure of the mills, a large portion of its land in the prime area of the city as well as recently purchased latest machinery worth Rs 30 crore were sold dirt cheap.â€�Itâ€™s a shame that when the city is celebrating its tercentenary, one of the glorious chapters in its history is being wiped out,â€™â€™ said Congress leader Banwarilal Purohit and INTUC leader Haribhau Naik who is also chief of National Mill Mazdoor, the millsâ€™ majority union. Mr Purohit said it was shocking that Mr Chaturvedi was presiding over the millsâ€™ closure.

The Tatas began Empress Mills in the cotton belt of Vidarbha as their first industrial venture in the country giving employment to 7,000 people. In the 80â€™s they pulled out as running it made no economic sense without the urgently needed modernisation. The mills were then taken over by the Maharashtra State Textile Corporation (MSTC).

Soon afterwards the staff was cut down and despite modern machinery the MSTC failed to make profits. In September, the MSTC finally applied to the joint commissioner of textiles and got permission to close the mills.

25,Police await government nod on autopsy,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police has postponed the autopsy on the bodies of two Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists, Abu Anas alias Dawood Ali and Ezaz Ahmed alias Deepak, who were killed in an encounter on Sunday night at the Ansal Plaza shopping complex.

The autopsy was to be conducted on Thursday, 72 hours after they were shot. According to police commissioner R S Gupta, the police have furnished details regarding their identity to the ministry of home affairs (MHA).

""Since the two have been identified as Pakistan nationals, the MHA will inform the foreign ministry who have contacted the Pakistan authorities and are awaiting their response. The MHA will tell us when to conduct the autopsy,"" Gupta said.

A senior police officer said the delay in conducting the autopsy was not unusual. According to him, the autopsy on bodies of terrorists killed during the Parliament attack in December 2001 was conducted almost a month after the incident.

Similarly even in the Red Fort shootout case, the autopsy test on the bodies of the terrorists killed during an encounter in Batla house was conducted 10 days later.

Making a headway into the investigations, the police have identified a south Delhi based shop from where the two terrorists had purchased a pre-paid card for their mobile phone.

""The terrorists had furnished a Jammu and Kashmir address in the registration form filled up to get a pre-paid connection,"" the officer said.

He added the terrorists had given a ration card as proof of their identity. ""A special cell team has been sent to Jammu and Kashmir to check how authentic the documents are,"" the officer said.

A perusal of the mobile phone records show that the terrorists had called several Pakistani numbers on various occasions. One of the number has been identified as that of Azam Cheema, LeT launch commander in Bahawalpur.

The police are also working on the identity of the owner of Maruti car used by the terrorists to reach Ansal Plaza. The owner, Mohammad Gulrez was questioned by the special cell officials. According to the police, Gulrez had purchased the car from a car bazaar in Lucknow in February 2002.

""We are trying to trace the original owner. For this, a team has been sent to Uttar Pradesh,"" the officer said. A team has also been dispatched to Mumbai to trace the terrorists'' hideouts.

The police, meanwhile, was busy trying to trace those who had witnessed the shoot-out in the basement of Ansal Plaza shopping complex. The police is forming a list of witnesses to support their reply before the National Human Rights Commission.

The police have a week''s time to counter a complaint alleging the encounter was fake. The complaint is based on a newspaper report which cited a doctor who reportedly witnessed some policemen shooting at the two men.

""We had not written the names of the witnesses but had noted their car numbers because some got damaged during the encounter. The police shall trace the owner of the car and speak to them. We hope they will come forward,"" a senior police officer said.
