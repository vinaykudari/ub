1,"LF win twin bypolls, major drubbing for Trinamul","KOLKATA: The CPM won both bypolls held on Sunday, the Nabadwip Lok Sabha seat and Vidyasagar assembly seat.

The Trinamul Congress received a major drubbing at Nabadwip, losing a seat by 98,800 votes. At Vidyasagar, rebel Trinamul leader Ajit Panjaâ€™s daughter Mohua Mondal lost on a Congress ticket.

At Nabadwip, Trinamul candidate Abir Ranjan Biswas failed to repeat the performance of his father Ananda Mohan Biswas, whose death had caused the bypoll. Biswas got 421,830 votes while CPM candidate Alokesh Das romped home with 520,630. Veteran Congressman Rajani Kanta Doloi managed only 137,319 votes.

Same story at Vidyasagar with Anadi K. Sahu (CPM) winning by a convincing margin of 22,829 votes over Mondal, his nearest rival.

Sahu got 42,321 votes, Mondal 19,492. BJP candidate Ashok Sinha managed only 3,577 votes and lost his deposit.

Though polling was held through EVMs, it took nine hours to declare the results of the Nabadwip polls. EC officials said technical snags held up results. The Vidyasagar assembly constituency results were, however, declared early in the day.

â€œWe had some trouble getting in touch with Ranaghat over fax. We canâ€™t rely on telephone messages. The results could only be confirmed in the evening. There was no trouble during the counting,â€� said state chief electoral officer Nurul Haque.

Shocked by the twin setback, Mamata Banerjee locked herself indoors at her south Kolkata residence throughout the day.

Trinamulâ€™s resounding defeats, especially at Nabadwip where Mamata had camped with her senior leaders for eight days, is being described as her â€œWaterlooâ€�.

No senior Trinamul leader visited Mamataâ€™s Harish Chatterjee Street residence during the day. Her supporters, who had always thronged her house even a year ago, were nowhere to be seen.

With her partyâ€™s effective strength in Parliament dropping from nine to five, several Trinamul leaders wondered in private if they should seek greener pasteurs.

Indications of a rebellion began to germinate with some Trinamul MLAs questioning Mamataâ€™s decision to continue the state assembly boycott, which had started after allegations of violence in panchayat polls.

In a message from Italy, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said his government would honour the peopleâ€™s verdict.

CPM state secretary Anil Biswas described the twinwins as rejection of the Centreâ€™s economic policies.

The state BJP expressed dissatisfaction at the partyâ€™s performance at Vidyasagar and said it would review the results to find what went wrong. State BJP chief Tathagata Ray said the CPM had resorted to proxy voting at Vidyasagar. But he admitted that a brainstorming session was essential to identify the partyâ€™s weakness. He said the Trinamul-BJP alliance in the state would continue.

The state Congress took the defeats in their stride and admitted that the results proved the party needed to tighten its belt. â€œThe Congress had weakness of its own, which will have to be rectified in future,â€� state Congress general secretary Manas Bhuinya said.

2,IAS officer fights against alleged state govt jobs scam,"NEW DELHI: Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala is in the dock over the controversial appointment of about 4,000 school teachers in the state.

The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice to Chautala, the state government and the state vigilance chief on a petition filed by a senior IAS officer seeking a CBI probe in the job scam.

A vacation Bench of Justices R C Lahoti and Brijesh Kumar fixed June 19 to hear the petition by IAS officer Sanjiv Kumar, who is working with the state education department.

Kumar contended that Chautala and his aides had been harassing him as he had refused to include their nominees in the list of primary teachers. Kumar''s counsel Rajeev Dhavan and M N Krishnamani also contended that the petitioner had been suspended by the state government on the basis of unfounded allegations.

As Kumar, an IAS officer of 1985 batch, had discharged his duties in an honest manner, not to the liking of the chief minister, he and his family members were being threatened, counsel said.

``Unknown persons are being sent to his house and there is a possibility that the petitioner and his family members may be attacked or murdered by henchmen of the chief minister,'''' counsel added.

``The entire matter may be investigated by an independent agency like the CBI so that the truth may come before the Supreme Court,'''' Kumar pleaded in the petition.

Counsel claimed that Kumar was in possession of ``all the false and fabricated select lists of 19 districts duly signed by members of 19 district selection committee'''' which was prepared at the behest of Chautala six months after the committees had given the original list.

Counsel added that Kumar invited the wrath of Chautala when he, while holding additional charge of director, primary education, ``did not oblige certain persons, including Chautala, to accommodate persons of their own choice while making about 4,000 appointments to the posts of JBT teachers''''.

3,MCC targets Jharkhand rlys in bandh,"RANCHI: The Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), which had called for a 48-hour Jharkhand bandh beginning Tuesday, blew up railway tracks, ransacked a railway station and set afire a goods train engine on the second day of the bandh on Wednesday.

Even as intelligence reports had indicated that extremists could target railway stations and property, leading to extra vigil on tracks and sensitive stations by the police, around 200 armed MCC men set the eastern cabin of Harubera railway station on the Muri-Barkakana section of the South-Eastern Railway on fire at 1 am on Wednesday after snapping the communication system.

The MCC blasted at least a metre-long track disrupting rail traffic on the route. Express and goods trains plying on the route were affected by the blast.

According to another report, about 15-20 armed men targeted the Daniya railway station on the Ramgarh-Gomoh section around 1.45 in the morning, and after scaring away railway employees and staff locked the office of the station master, paralysing rail traffic on the route.

The MCC also removed fish plates at Garandih near the Bokaro thermal power station, once again paralysing traffic on the route. An engine of a goods train was set afire on the Barwadih-Barkakana railway line at Latehar at 12.40 am.

The bandh was called to protest alleged police atrocities on the outfitâ€™s members.

The national highways, however, continued to be near deserted on the second day on Wednesday with few trucks and private buses plying.

However, according to reports reaching the police headquarters here, traffic on the Grand Trunk road was normal.

4,"Let them first arrest me, then see reaction: Badal","AMRITSAR: The SAD(B) chief Parkash Singh Badal said at Rampura Phool town on Wednesday that the Amarinder government was ""not interested in nailing corruption but only in witch-hunting"".

Speaking to media persons here, Badal said that Amarinder Singh wanted to arrest him as he was confused after he (Badal) filed a suit for damages of Rs 5 crore against the chief minister for defaming him. When asked how his party would react to his arrest, Badal said: ""Let them first arrest me, then see the reaction"".

The only motive behind arresting Akali leaders by the Congress government in the state was to tarnish the image of party leaders, said Badal. ""If the chief minister was sincere in nailing corruption, I challenge him to let a High Court judge or Lok Pal investigate the things. But corruption is not his (Amarinder''s) agenda, he is interested only in witch-hunting and targeting Akalis for political vendetta,"" said Badal.

Blaming the Congress for the Talhan clash, Badal said it was their ""old divide and rule"" policy. ""They are trying to divide the society on caste and creed basis for their political benefits,"" Badal said.

About wheat and wheat husk relief by the state government to Rajasthan, Badal quipped: ""It is strange farmers in his (CM''s) own state are being put in jail for their pitiable economic condition. The CM was generous in doling out favours to neigbhours"".

Meanwhile, the American Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has granted a sum of Rs 1.5 lakh for the victims of the Talhan clashes. Disclosing this over telephone, committee convener Pritpal Singh said that Sikhs in the US were perturbed by the recent violence in the state. The amount would be distributed through SAD (Democratic) president Kuldeep Singh Wadala, he added.

5,PM keen on Ayodhya solution before LS polls,"NEW DELHI: The Vajpayee government is making a final bid for a solution to Ayodhya with the help of the Shankaracharya of Kanchi, Jayendra Saraswati which it hopes will lead to a parliamentary resolution before the general elections of 2004, highly placed sources said on Thursday.

The government does not plan a legislation, as had been suggested by the RSS and the VHP. Instead, it wants the solution to come through a private member''s resolution not a government-sponsored one which will be moved only after the assembly elections later this year.

Like the Kashmir issue, the PM, the sources said, is keen on a settlement of Ayodhya in his current tenure.

The Shankaracharya''s efforts may have been cold-shouldered by the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board, but have found support from two religious leaders, Lucknow''s Maulana Kalbe Sadiq and Nagpur''s Maulana Abdul Pariq. On the Hindu front, BJP sources said there are efforts to divide the VHP and get the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas on board.

The reason for the effort to sideline the VHP, sources added, was that its chief Ashok Singhal had insisted that the proposed parliamentary resolution should be a government-sponsored one. The BJP leadership would prefer it be a private member''s resolution so that if it fails, it will not affect it that much.

The formula, the sources said, envisages an agreement on a Ram Temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, a mosque within a 10-km radius, Hindu organisations renouncing claims to Kashi, Mathura or any other site, and several defunct mosques currently under the care of the ASI being thrown open for worship. The success of the formula, the sources said, would be contingent on Congress support.

The sources also said this explains the presence of senior Congress leaders at the 50th Peetharohanam function of Sri Jayendra Saraswati last Sunday. Party president Sonia Gandhi, Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit and former PM Narasimha Rao were present.

The BJP feels that if the Congress, the largest opposition party, backs it, a solution would be possible. The line is that it would be mutually beneficial for the BJP and the Congress in UP, where both parties have lost considerable support base.

The PM''s speech at the Peetharohanam function also holds hints of what the formula consists of. He had said that though the matter was before the judiciary, it should not prevent a dialogue for a ``mutually acceptable'''' solution. ``The talks should be focused on Ayodhya as well as on...matters that will promote ...harmony between the two communities... The Ayodhya issue can be resolved only when...political parties stop looking at it from the point of view of who gains and who loses.''''

Referring to the ongoing and past efforts of the Shankaracharya currently in touch with some Muslim leaders to whom he had made the offer of facilitating the opening of ASI mosques the PM said: ``The Kanchi mutt practices secularism in its true sense of the term. There is a masjid beside the Kanchi mutt. Both puja and namaz take place at the same time. Someone once asked Swamiji, `Doesn''t this masjid disturb you?''. Swamiji replied, `No, the mandir and masjid have been together and will remain together. This is our tradition.''''

Meanwhile, the Nyas'' Ramchandra Paramhans met deputy PM L K Advani recently to discuss the issue. It did not go that well as VHP functionary Giriraj Kishore said Advani''s lack of sympathy had caused Paramhans to be so ``sad'''' that he suffered a heart attack on Thursday.

6,Maya's return raises pitch of UP political battle,"NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati on Thursday raised the pitch of the ongoing power struggle in her state by claiming that at least 25 Samajwadi Party MLAs are in touch with her.

Talking to reporters on her arrival here from a 15-day tour abroad, she once sniped at her opponents by saying that the SP `dissidents'' were ready to come out openly in her support.

``Had my government been really in danger, I would have postponed the trip,'''' she remarked referring to the jaunt that had taken her to the US, Canada, UK, France and Switzerland. The CM claimed that she had more than the required number of MLAs to prove her majority.

She ascribed the latest round of opposition activity to an `apprehension'' that the SP could break. ``Mulayam Singh Yadav has come to know about it and that''s why he has started talking about toppling my government again,'''' she said.

Her opponents, on their part, have challenged the CM to take a fresh confidence vote in the assembly. ``If the support of the 14-member Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) had convinced the governor of the stability of the Mayawati government, then its exit from the ruling coalition should prompt him to advise the CM to go for a confidence vote,'''' Yadav said.

Returning here after a tour of eastern UP, Yadav said he would consult Congress president Sonia Gandhi shortly about the next course of action for the united opposition.

The SP-led front in UP got a boost recently when RLD leader Ajit Singh announced his party''s support to it and the Congress overcame its hesitation in formally being part of the opposition combine.

The Congress sees a threat to its substantial Dalit vote-bank in states like Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh because of Mayawati''s emergence as a new icon for the community. Assembly elections are due in these three states later this year.

The coming together of the SP, Congress, RLD and former chief minister Kalyan Singh''s Rashtriya Kranti Dal, among others, has raised hope of a broad alliance in UP for the Lok Sabha elections next year. Such a combine is likely to have a bearing on opposition unity elsewhere as well.

7,Local train fares to be increased from July 1,"MUMBAI: Commuting by local trains will be costlier from July 1, with a surcharge on rail fares being introduced to help repay the World Bank loan for the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP).

The surcharge is expected to net an additional Rs 95 crore annually for the railways. Second-class card tickets will become dearer by Re 1, while first-class card tickets will cost Rs 2 more. However, those travelling less than 5 km will not be affected by the fare hike.

The surcharge on monthly season tickets will vary from Rs 10 for second class and Rs 15-20 for the first class. For quarterly passes, the surcharge will be thrice those amounts.

Meanwhile, commuter organisations are not in favour of the new surcharge. â€œPassenger amenities have not improved in spite of the World Bank loan. So why should commuters pay more?â€™â€™ asked Madhu Kotian of the Mumbai Rail Pravasi Sangh. He stated that his association would write protest letters to the Unuion railway ministry.

Last June, the World Bank approved Rs 2,602 crore for the MUTP, which aims to improve road and rail travel in the city. The railways will get Rs 1,613 crore of that amount, which will be used to add new tracks, and procure new trains and equipment.

MUTP projects include quadrupling the Borivli-Virar tracks and adding two more tracks between Kurla and Thane.

8,HP polls phase II: Clean sweep by Cong,"DHARAMSALA: The Congress made a clean sweep by winning all the three tribal assembly seats of Bharmour (Chamba), Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti in the second phase of the Himachal assembly elections, the results of which were declared on Wednesday.

In Bharmour, Thakur Singh Bharmouri of the Congress defeated his nearest BJP rival Tulsi Ram by an impressive margin of 9,692 votes. While Bharmouri polled 21,869 votes, Tulsi Ram could manage just 12,177.

Raghvir Singh of the Congress (9,458 votes) won the Lahaul-Spiti assembly seat, defeating Himachal Vikas Congress (HVC) candidate Ram Lal Markanday by 4,768 votes. BJP candidate Yuvraj Bodh finished a poor third, securing 1,961 votes.

The Congress also won the Kinnaur assembly seat comfortably, with its candidate Jagat Singh Negi (19,052 votes) defeating his nearest BJP rival Tejwant Singh by 7,406 votes.

With these wins, the Congress now has a strength of 43 in the 68-member Vidhan Sabha, followed by the BJP which has 16 members. While six of the legislators are Independents, the HVC, the Lok Janshakti Party and the Him Loktantrik Morcha have one seat each.

The Congress victory in these three tribal seats has further strengthened the position of chief minister Virbahdra Singh as all the winning candidates happen to be his loyalists.

Commenting on the poll outcome, Virbhadra said that people had voted in favour of the ""progressive"" policies of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and in support of the present government''s ""crusade against corruption"".

He said the election results had once again exposed the BJP, which had ""failed"" to safeguard the interests of the state. ""My government will come up to the expectations of the people of the state by accelerating the pace of development, particularly in tribal areas,"" he claimed.

The mood in the BJP camp was sombre. Himachal BJP president Jai Kishen Sharma, reacting to his party''s defeat, said, ""We accept the verdict of the people."" However, he alleged that the Congress had misused the official machinery to win these elections.

9,Two Sangli cops arrested on bribery charges,"MUMBAI: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Wednesday trapped police inspector Suresh Pawar and sub-inspector Adhikar Pol of the Sangli police for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 25,000 from an artisan in Mumbai.

ACB sources that the policemen had demanded the bribe from Khalaluddin Shaikh, an artisan who works in the Zaveri Bazaar area. The two Sangli policemen had earlier questioned Shaikh regarding a bank dacoity in Sangli district.

Assistant commissioner Vilas Tupe said the Sangli policemen told Shaikh they would arrest him if he did not pay the bribe.

The ACB then laid a trap near S.K. Patil Udyan and the inspector and sub-inspector were arrested two days ago while accepting the Rs 25,000 from Shaikh.

10,"Intimidation won't fetch investments, warns CM","RANJANGAON, (Pune dist.): Without naming the Shiv Sena, Maharashtra chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde said on Wednesday his government would not tolerate any attempts at creating instability for industries wanting to establish operations in the state.

Commenting on the current controversy raked up by the Shiv Sena by using intimidatory tactics to demand employment for Maharashtrians, Shinde said that he was also of the view that the local people should get jobs. This, however, did not mean that intimidatory tactics should be used against managements to the point that they felt like running away from the state, he added.

â€œI agree entirely that the sons of the soil should get the benefit of investments in industries. However, it is not right to intimidate managements on this issue. First, let the investments come and let the factories begin operations,â€� Shinde said in an obvious reference to the stir created by the Sena on employment for Maharashtrians.

Speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony of the South Korean multinational, LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltdâ€™s new plant at Ranjangaon, about 50 km from Pune, Shinde acknowledged that Maharashtra was passing through a difficult situation and was in need of investments from outside.

He agreed with the recent assessment made by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) that industrial investment had dipped in the state, and said that in an attempt to improve the situation, he had decided to give â€œred carpet treatmentâ€� to those wanting to invest in Maharashtra. â€œWe have also announced numerous sops for the information technology industry. We are at a take-off stage and we donâ€™t want any obstacles,â€� Shinde said.

Pointing to home minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who was sitting by his side at the function, the chief minister remarked: â€œI am saying this in the presence of the home minister, that we will not tolerate any attempts at instability in the state.â€� Between August 1991 and February 2003, Maharashtra had received over 3,000 foreign direct investment approvals and Rs 50,000 crore in investments.

The chief minister denied transferring co-operation commissioner Ratnakar Gaikwad, who has been aggressively pursuing frauds in co-operative banks, irrespective of their political affiliations. In a pat on his back, Shinde said, â€œGaikwad has not been transferred. In fact, officials like him should be allowed to work.â€�

Asked specifically whether papers recommending Gaikwadâ€™s transfer had been forwarded for his signature, Shinde said: â€œI have not signed any such papers or seen any such file.â€� The coalition partner, the Nationalist Congress Party, has been openly calling for Gaikwadâ€™s transfer as he had exposed frauds worth crores of rupees in co-operative banks dominated by the NCP. LG Electronics vice-chairman S.S. Kim said the company would invest Rs 500 crore over five years at its Ranjangaon plant.

11,Shastri under fire for statement on Maya govt,"LUCKNOW: The governorâ€™s statement that Mayawati government still enjoyed majority, has predictably stirred the hornetâ€™s nest in the highly surcharged political climate here.

State president of Samajwadi Party, Ram Saran Das dashed off a letter to governor Vishnukant Shastri on Wednesday, denouncing the statement as â€œunfortunate and highly objectionable.â€�

â€œNo one, not even a governor is qualified to deliver a judgement whether a government was in majority or minority. The right place to decide the issue is the floor of the House. Therefore the governorâ€™s claim that despite the withdrawal of support from RLD, the government still enjoyed majority is incorrect,â€� stated the letter.

Das further requested the governor to act impartially, convene the House and direct the government to prove its majority on the floor.

Objecting to Shastriâ€™s statement, CLP leader Pramod Tiwari quoted the findings of Sarkaria Commission and Supreme courtâ€™s judgment in the Bommai case to drive home the point that withdrawal of RLDâ€™s support from the coalition per se, was tantamount to the government losing majority. Therefore the governor has only three options left â€” either dismiss the government; seek the resignation of ministers; or ask the government to prove its majority on the floor of the House. Raj Bhawan, in any case, Tiwari pointed out, was not a place to prove the status of the government.

The only course logically and legally to be followed under the circumstances, would be to convene a special session to thrash out the issue, he added.

Erstwhile UPCC president Arun Kumar Singh Munna termed the governorâ€™s reaction â€œvery unfortunate and not in keeping with the impartial office of a governorâ€�. The governor by taking sides blatantly has lowered the prestige of his office, Munna said. The Mayawati government had lost majority long ago and was living on borrowed time, said Munna while talking to TNN.

This realisation accounted for the farce of no confidence motion during the last assembly session and was also the reason why the BSP and BJP combine still fought shy of facing the House, he added. Munna exhorted the governor to rise above party interest and uphold justice.

12,Bare blackboards haunt govt schools,"HYDERABAD: All government schools in the state will reopen after summer vacations on Thursday. This year too, many government high schools will struggle to obtain their basic requirements such as chalk pieces.

â€œUnfortunately, it is the same situation as last year,â€� an education department official told The Times of India on Wednesday.

Every year, the state government sanctions Rs 5,000 for a government high school for buying chalk pieces, dusters, a minimum amount of stationery and the like. However, this amount is barely enough to meet the needs of a school.

It is only with great difficulty that headmasters manage to pull through the year. The annual sanction for each government high school falls in the category of a â€˜contingency fundâ€™which is a â€˜controlled itemâ€™ as far as the finance department is concerned.

â€œOnly if the fund position is comfortable does this money get released,â€� an official explained. The fate of the primary and upper primary government schools appears to be slightly better, as far as the release of funds is concerned. Every year, these schools get Rs 2,000 for purchasing supplies. Interestingly, the release is made possible because the money comes from central government schemes such as the District Primary Education Programme and the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan.

In Hyderabad, there are about 250 government high schools and about 900 primary and upper primary schools. â€œIt is a very difficult situation,â€� the education department official confessed.

Though there are some NGOs who chip in by providing facilities such as benches, chairs and tables or even school buildings, they naturally expect the government to provide the basics such as chalk pieces and dusters, the official added.

Even as the school committees comprising parents are expected to play a role in helping government schools function smoothly, only about 50 per cent of them are functioning while the rest were barely active.

â€œWe will soon have to conduct elections for these committees. Once the new committees are in, may be we can work towards pooling funds from private sources to help the schools,â€� the education department official said.

13,Trade bandh total; business grinds to halt,"MANGALORE: Most business establishments in Bunder and in other parts of Dakshina Kannada district remained closed on Wednesday in response to a bandh call given by Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI). It was a statewide effort.

The bandh was called against increase in taxes across the board by one per cent by way of an ordinance on 201 commodities and imposing a non-collectible additional tax of one per cent on all commodities on the first sale.

The KCCI has suggested to the Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) that they should resort to non-payment of non-collectible tax to the treasury to defeat the whole purpose of the ordinance.

On Wednesday morning, trade bodies took out a procession and submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner, urging the state government to remove the unjustified tax.Later, speaking to reporters, KCCI president Giridhar Prabhu said the government has resorted to an increase in taxes through the back door without taking people into confidence.He noted that the trade bodies had continuously agitated against the non-collectible tax for over two decades, which was abolished last year. This year, it has been introduced by another name called additional tax. Prabhu observed that this amounted to virtually a tax on income.

Belgaum: In Belgaum, the bandh was complete and peaceful, according to the SP B. Dayanand.The bandh call was given by the Belgaum Chamber of Commerce and Industries. The Belgaum unit of BJP extended support.

15,JKLF chief Yaseen Malik arrested,"SRINAGAR: JKLF chairman Mohammad Yaseen Malik was arrested on Thursday at Heelar in Anantnag district, 52 kms from Srinagar, while he was launching a signature campaign on the representation of Kashmiris in Indo-Pak talks to resolve the Kashmir tangle.

Several associates of Malik were also taken into police custody, police said.

JKLF spokesman Tahir Mir confirmed that Yaseen Malik along with two other party leaders Javid Ahmad Mir and Noor Mohammad Kawal had been arrested. He said the promises of the Mufti government turned out to be false when it arrested Malik for undertaking peaceful means to ascertain the will of the people on the Kashmir issue.

Condemning Malik''s arrest, JKLF vice-chairman Bashir Ahmed Bhat on Thursday said that the J&K government was frightened by the massive support given to the signature campaign of JKLF on Wednesday.

Malik, in his signature campaign gathered about 9000 signatures from the residents in Zalangam village in Kokernag in south Kashmir on Wednesday. The team met people there to seek their opinion on whether they favoured active involvement of Kashmiris in the expected dialogue between India and Pakistan.

The team included senior vice presidents Bashir Ahmad Bhat and Javid Ahmad Mir, Shoukat Ahmad Bakshi, Noor Mohammad Kalwal and Nazir Ahmad.

The pro-independence JKLF had said the signature campaign would continue in the district for the next eight days and would be launched simultaneously in other districts of the state from Thursday.

The JKLF intends to collect 2 million signatures across the state in a period of three months.

Tamil Nadu government had already banned Tamil Nadu Liberation Army, Tamil Nation Retrieval Army and Tamil Nationalist Movement led by P Nedumaran for supporting the cause of LTTE, besides arresting MDMK leader Vaiko under POTA for allegedly supporting the LTTE in a speech.

A government notification on Thursday said TVI, led by Suba Ilavarasan, had ""committed various acts of violence and a number of offences like extortion, atrocities on Dalits, criminal intimidation and damage to property and planting bombs thereby causing terror among the people.""

Members of TVI were earlier associated with Tamil Nadu Liberation Army, the notification said adding that the Director General of Police, through his letter to the government on May 20 last, had recommended the ban.

TVI members were suspected to have blown up one of the powerlines, disrupting power from Neyveli Lignite Corporation, last year in Villupuram district.

17,Response to Maruti's IPO vindicates govt's policies: Shourie,"NEW DELHI: Buoyed by the overwhelming response received by the Maruti Udyog''s maiden public offer of 7.2 crore shares, the government on Thursday said it was a vindication of its divestment ""policies and approach"".

""I am delighted with the response. It is also a vindication of the government''s policies and approach to disinvestment,"" Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie said over phone from Mumbai.

The issue for divestment of 25 per cent government equity in the car joint venture MUL with Japan''s Suzuki Motor was oversubscribed within three hours of its opening and bids totalling 7.89 crore shares were received on day one.

""The market reacts best when there is a strong strategic partner in place -- like Suzuki in this case,"" a jubilant Shourie said.

This is the first disinvestment being taken during the current financial year by the government, which was pegging its hopes on other issues based on the success of sale of shares in Maruti. Suzuki had committed to underwrite the issue at Rs 115 a share which became the floor price for IPO.

20,Pool authorities flout safety rules,"NEW DELHI: The death of 16-year-old Ankit in the swimming pool of the Punjabi Bagh Club has opened a can of worms on the blatant flouting of safety norms by pool authorities in the city. If one believes the local police, Ankit was not the member of the club and he entered the pool using someone elseâ€™s card. He had been using the pool regularly.

The police have registered a case of sheer negligence against the club on the basis of a complaint from Ankit''s grandfather. Deputy Commissioner of police (west), Satish Golcha, said: ""The deceased''s grandfather alleged that Ankit died due to negligence as there were five persons, including four instructors, present near the pool when this incident happened. A case under Section 304-A has been registered.""

The DCP said the pool''s licence has been suspended by the licensing department till the investigation is complete. The club has been served a show cause notice by the licensing branch. The question which remains unanswered though is what the life guards at the club were doing as the boy drowned. Police had admitted that all the guards were present at the time.

Police officers said that there is a plethora of dos and don''ts for anyone operating a pool, but its actual implementation is questionable. The two basic requirements to operate a pool are the possession of a valid licence and that the premises should be hygienic, but many seem to be flouting even those guidelines.

Five deaths have been reported in the last four years. A 12-year-old boy, drowned in an unauthorised private swimming pool in May 1999. A doctor drowned in the AIIMS swimming pool and another person in the pool of IIT in 2001.

As per a survey conducted by the Delhi Police after the two cases of drowning in May 1999, it was found that 88 private swimming pools, including 30 private pools in farm house, need either a licence or a fresh no-objection certificate. The defaulters list also included some educational institutions in the city.

The Jay Wellness in Greater Kailash and New Friends Colony Club had their licenses cancelled by the licensing department earlier this year. Jay Wellness club reportedly failed to fulfill the conditions. The New Friends Colony club did not have MCD''s approval.

The police admitted that this is more due to the fact that little is known about the rules laid down by the licensing department. The list of conditions and norms is fairly comprehensive and stringent.

21,"Married against his wish, SI commits suicide","NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old Delhi Police sub-inspector (SI), Maneesh Kumar, committed suicide at his Tagore Garden residence on Wednesday night. According to sources, he was under severe depression because he had been forced to marry against his wishes by his parents.

The SI had joined Delhi Police in 1997. His father is a retired Delhi municipal corporation superintendent. The SI had been transferred to the west district in 2000.

According to the police, the SI committed suicide by hanging himself from a hook meant for the ceiling fan in a third floor room of his house. He came back from duty after midnight and reportedly went to the room with a bed sheet. When his elder brother, who is also a sub-inspector, went up, he noticed that the room was open and the body was hanging from the hook in the ceiling. According to the police, the SI had written ''sorry'' on his left hand with a ball point pen. No suicide note was found though.

According to sources, the deceased had been forced by his parents to marry against his wishes in November 2002. His wife is the daughter of a retired income-tax assistant commissioner. Sources said the SI had wanted to marry another girl.

On February 16 this year, he went on two days leave, but did not report back to duty. His wife had reportedly filed a dowry harassment case in the Crime Against Women cell. He was posted with the vigilance department then. On February 20, his father lodged a complaint with the Tagore Garden police. According to sources, he called up his parents and asked them to send his wife back to her parent''s house. Only then, he had said, he would return.

Even as the parents complied with his wish, differences reportedly began to crop between the SI and the girl he wanted to marry.

22,Intimidation won't fetch investments: CM,"RANJANGAON, Pune Dist: Without naming the Shiv Sena, Maharashtra chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde said on Wednesday his government would not tolerate any attempts at creating instability for industries wanting to establish operations in the state.

Commenting on the current controversy raked up by the Shiv Sena by using intimidatory tactics to demand employment for Maharashtrians, Shinde said that he was also of the view that the local people should get jobs.

This, however, did not mean that intimidatory tactics should be used against managements to the point that they felt like running away from the state, he added.

""I agree entirely that the sons of the soil should get the benefit of investments in industries.

However, it is not right to intimidate managements on this issue. First, let the investments come and let the factories begin operations,"" Shinde said in an obvious reference to the stir created by the Sena on employment for Maharashtrians.

Speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony of the South Korean multinational, LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd''s new plant at Ranjangaon, about 50 km from Pune, Shinde acknowledged that Maharashtra was passing through a difficult situation and was in need of investments from outside.

He agreed with the recent assessment made by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) that industrial investment had dipped in the state, and said that in an attempt to improve the situation, he had decided to give ""red carpet treatment"" to those wanting to invest in Maharashtra.

""We have also announced numerous sops for the information technology industry. We are at a take-off stage and we don''t want any obstacles,"" Shinde said.

Pointing to home minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who was sitting by his side at the function, the chief minister remarked: ""I am saying this in the presence of the home minister, that we will not tolerate any attempts at instability in the state.""

Between August 1991 and February 2003, Maharashtra had received over 3,000 foreign direct investment approvals and Rs 50,000 crore in investments.

The chief minister denied transferring co-operation commissioner Ratnakar Gaikwad, who has been aggressively pursuing frauds in co-operative banks, irrespective of their political affiliations.

In a pat on his back, Shinde said, ""Gaikwad has not been transferred. In fact, officials like him should be allowed to work."" Asked specifically whether papers recommending Gaikwad''s transfer had been forwarded for his signature, Shinde said: ""I have not signed any such papers or seen any such file.""

The coalition partner, the Nationalist Congress Party, has been openly calling for Gaikwad''s transfer as he had exposed frauds worth crores of rupees in co-operative banks dominated by the NCP.

LG Electronics vice-chairman S.S. Kim said the company would invest Rs 500 crore over five years at its Ranjangaon plant.

23,Pu La continues to rule hearts in Pune,"PUNE: As Punekars fondly recalled memories associated with multifaceted Marathi humorist and philanthropist Pu La Deshpande on his third death anniversary on Thursday, many of his close friends went misty-eyed as they spoke about ""Maharashtra''s darling.""

While Pu La lived at many places right from Delhi to Belgaum, he chose to settle in Pune, something Punekars feel extremely proud of.

That was the reason why people used to throng Prayag hospital during his last days as they prayed for his recovery. Whenever he fell sick, letters poured in suggesting remedies â€” complete with detailed descriptions of making potions from herbs.

So what drew Pu La to Pune?

Noted film director and Pu La''s friend of 57 years Ram Gabale explains: ""After Vile Parle, it was only Pune which could hold his heart. In fact, I remember how he instantly fell in love with the city in 1951-52 when he had come here during the making of my film, Doodh Bhaat.

Gabale feels that the culturally-enriched atmosphere and appreciative people of Pune nurtured Pu La.

""They loved him and he never felt like going anywhere else,"" he said, adding that Pune also offered him mental stability and peace.

Gabale did more than eight films in which Pu La was involved either as an actor, music director, story or screenplay writer. ""There was nothing he could not do. Each of his skills complemented the other and made him so special,"" Gabale remarked.

And his literature, says Gabale, is universal and humane.

Virendra Chitrao, secretary of the Aashay Film Club, recalled: ""The year was 1987 and Aashay was very new. However, Pu La was so taken in by the concept that he assumed our guardianship. He became one of us.

""He used to call us frequently, make suggestions, arrange programmes for the club and also canvass for getting new members.""

Explaining why Pu La''s literature still attracts people, Chitrao says that besides being humane, his books brought pure joy to readers. ""Even in those days, Pu La had the vision like multimedia, which made his writings suitable for this new medium,"" he observes. His humour is clean, pure and has no malice or monotony, Chitrao says.

While several programmes were held in the city on Thursday to remember Pu La, Aashay has organised a four-day festival comprising presentations on pen-sketches written by Pu La, his play Ek Zunja Varyashi, screening of audio-visual poetry recitation session by Pu La''s wife, Sunitabai, among others.

Chitrao says that Pu La will continue to lure generations to come. Remarks Gabale: ""A person who can forget Pu La is yet to be born"".
