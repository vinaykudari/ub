0,Court orders cop's arrest on murder charge,"NEW DELHI: A city court on Thursday ordered the arrest of a Delhi Police inspector who was found guilty of killing of a student during the Mandal Commission agitation in Sarojini Nagar.

Inspector D P Singh, who was a sub-inspector in 1990, had fired at protesters killing Aditya Narayan, 15.

Public prosecutor Vipin Sanduja proved in court that Singh got a false FIR registered in Sarojini Nagar claiming the bullet was fired by a constable in self-defence on being mobbed by protesters.

â€˜â€˜The ballistic reports and the victimâ€™s autopsy proved it was a bullet from Singhâ€™s service weapon which hit the victim in the head. But the Crime Branch, which was investigating the matter on a courtâ€™s direction, registered a case of causing death due to negligence and not murder,â€™â€™ he said.

A complaint was filed by the victimâ€™s father R N Sharma in court alleging the shot was fired by Singh.

1,Boy arrested for cousin's murder,"NEW DELHI: The west district police on Thursday claimed to have worked out a case of kidnapping and murder of Harshdeep, 6, with the arrest of his cousin. The accused, a 17-year-old, allegedly kidnapped and killed Harshdeep for ransom.

The accused, Iqbal (name changed), lived in the same neighbourhood as the victim. Harshdeep was reported missing by his family on March 4 at 8 pm. At about 10.30 pm the same day, the Tilak Nagar family received a ransom call.

â€˜â€˜He kidnapped him while the child was playing in front of his house. The accused said he wanted to earn some quick money and that he got the idea from television and movies,â€™â€™ said DCP (west) Satish Golcha.

The police said Iqbal kidnapped Harshdeep and took him to an isolated place between Keshopur Sabzi Mandi and Outer Ring Road. He hit the child on the head with a stone and killed him. He then made a ransom call from a PCO booth nearby, said the police.

â€˜â€˜He did not ask for any specific amount, but asked what the family could pay to get the child back,â€™â€™ Golcha said.

When investigation began, Iqbal reportedly showed keen interest in helping the police to trace his missing cousin. â€˜â€˜When we questioned him, his statements were inconsistent. Finally, after repeated questioning, on Wednesday night, he broke down and confessed to having killed his cousin,â€™â€™ said a police officer.

2,Women’s groups counter ‘myths’ about rape laws,"MUMBAI: Dismayed by the growing perception that laws related to domestic violence and rape are being misused, several womenâ€™s groups came together on Thursday to counter this â€œmythâ€™â€™.

The groups, including â€˜Aksharraâ€™ and Majlisâ€™, noted that not only are cases of dowry harassment and murder on the rise, but these figures are also a gross under-estimation since only a fraction of incidents come to the police.

Activists say the widespread belief that Section 498 A, which relates tomental and physical cruelty to the wife, is beingmisused is amyth perpetuated by lawyers looking for lucrative practice.

â€œFear is good business for lawyers,â€™â€™ said Flavia Agnes, a lawyer with the womenâ€™s legal aid group Majlis. â€œLawyers scare husbands into taking anticipatory bail for 498 A.â€™â€™

Cases registered under this section are non-bailable offences. According to the recent National Family Health Survey, 16 per cent of married women in Maharashtra have reported violence, which comes to about 15 lakh women in the state, yet the number of cases lodged under section 498 A in the state in 2003 is only 6,090.

Statistics also show that these cases in the city have dipped since the mid-90s, partly because of a police circular in 1993 cautioning officers to get proof of physical injury. While activists agree that the law is misused sometimes, they also claim that this happens as much as any other law.

Of the cases registered under this section, only 12 per cent are not chargesheeted, suggesting that misuseis not widespread as false complaints would collapse during investigation. In fact, the bias against Section 498 A has become so entrenched, claim activists, that it is difficult for women to file complaints.

â€œThe police deter women by telling them they will be homeless,â€™â€™ says Trupti Panchal, coordinator of the special cell for women â€œThey try to arbitrate, often forgetting that 498 A is a matter of crime not negotiation.â€™â€™ Activists also say this perception has crept into the judicial discourse, with judges relying on stereotypes about about such complaints.

As for laws related to rape and divorce, many activists say these laws are not loaded against men. In cases of rape, sexual intercourse has to be proved. And the laws on divorce are biased against womenâ€”statistics show that maintenances hover around small amounts of Rs 500, and the law stipulates that a woman who is living â€œin adulteryâ€™â€™ is not entitled tomaintenance.

â€œThe most common ploy to defeat the claims of a woman is to portray her as being a sexually promiscous as well as a property-grabbing manipulator,â€™â€™ says Agnes.

3,"Girl suicide: HC rejects bail plea of mother, son","KOLKATA: A Calcutta High Court division Bench on Thursday rejected the bail petitions of a mother and son from Nadia, accused of abetting the suicide of a class XII student.

Aditya and Indrani Das were arrested from Krishnanagar on March 5 after Sayantani Pathak, a student of Brajabala Girlsâ€™ High School, committed suicide.

According to police, Aditya, a class XI student, used to harass Sayantani on her way to school and back. He also made telephone calls to her. On one occasion, Sayantani had slapped Aditya. A few days later, on February 26, Adityaâ€™s mother accosted Sayantani while she was going to her private tutor and abused her.

Unable to bear the insult, Sayantani, who was to appear for her Higher Secondary examination this year, took poison. She died in hospital the next day. Advocate Y.Z. Dastoor submitted that it was a case of suicide and his clients had nothing to do in the matter.

State counsel Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, however, pointed to eyewitness accounts that Indrani had told Sayantani, â€œHad I been in your place, I would have gone home and taken poison.â€�

4,Sena needs MLAs for RS elections,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena has decided not to let its MLA resign en masse in order to force the government to hold simultaneous elections because the party fears that if its MLAs resign from the legislative assembly, the saffron allies will lose their share of seats in the two upper houses.

Not that the BJP wasnâ€™t worried about its share of seats in the twin elections.

BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan whose Rajya Sabha term is drawing to a close, for instance has been elected to the upper house from Maharashtra.

â€œBut, we thought that our mass resignation threat would bring the DF government to its knees,â€™â€™ sighed a BJP functionary.

Efforts were afoot by the state BJP on Thursday to persuade Sena chief Bal Thackeray to postpone the Friday press conference at which the Sena chief is expected to spell out his partyâ€™s stance on the issue.

State BJP bigwigs have excused themselves from Mr Thackerayâ€™s press conference by citing the day-long meeting of the partyâ€™s parliamentary board as the reason.

5,"Heil Adolf, since history's come alive","KOLKATA: â€œCanâ€™t stand him!â€� a viewer in Kolkata said as the curtains fell on Adolf, hosted by BCL and ICICI on Thursday. Pip Utton wasnâ€™t flapped by the disdain.

The British actor whoâ€™s been playing the Third Reich around the globe for seven years has seen people get up and leave, call him a â€˜Bastard,â€™ even punch him.

He wouldnâ€™t be surprised if the viewer was a Leftist. Elsewhere, a woman flipped because her son had just revealed he was gay. Communists and homosexuals â€” like negros, gypsies and jews â€” were â€œverminâ€� that Hitler would have â€œcleansedâ€� mankind of.

â€œThese viewers get lost in the performance and think Iâ€™m racist,â€� Utton knows. Itâ€™s not easy to play an icon of hatred like Hitler. Then, thereâ€™s Dictator Chaplin, whoâ€™s easier to come to terms with since heâ€™s a comic figure. â€œThe Germans in particular donâ€™t like to see Hitler say something sensible, they want him to be a raving ranting fool.â€� Utton wanted to be Adolf Hitler â€œnot to play psychiatrist exploring WHY he acted so, but HOW he managed to convince so many, inspire fanatical love, even worship.â€�

The character was a challenge to the jeweller-turnedactor, then. â€œActors always look for something thatâ€™d redeem the evil. But I wanted it to be a study in pure evil.â€� Why? â€œLike the second half shows, the fascist never went away.â€� He lurks deep inside us, and surfaces every time intolerance rears its ugly head in our societies â€” in the name of tribe, religion, country...

The actorâ€™s writing wisdom and performance skill is to warn us of this reach of history. Utton, a child of â€œthe age of flower power,â€� is startled by the rekindling of racism in recent years. Thatâ€™s why he scrutinises todayâ€™s leaders as they use Hitlerâ€™s perverted emotive logic. This sure called for research, â€œfrom Mein Kampf to Table Talk, screen footage to newsroom recordings.â€� More, since the play doesnâ€™t end in the bunker. So Utton reads the newspaper â€œin every country I visit, and weave in the headlines.â€�

No oneâ€™s spared, then: Neither the â€œBritish Blare whoâ€™s always beating around the Bush;â€� nor the Australians who ask â€œAny conviction?â€� before they let men through the immigration. Neither â€œIndia Shiningâ€� nor â€œMr Thackeray who gave Rs 1,000 to one who sought Rs 100 for a one-way ticket to Pakistan.â€�

These references keep Adolf ticking. These, and the fact that historyâ€™s not confined to the past, it lives in todayâ€™s headlines.

6,IIM-A flouted fee laws: HRD ministry,"NEW DELHI: Section 3 of the Memorandum of Association (MoA) says the IIM society can fix the fees after laying it down in the bye-laws. Article 3 (ii) says the society can do this, but after the approval of the Central and the state governments, said a senior official.

The HRD ministry alleged that the IIMs had not framed the bye-laws with the prior approval of the Central government. This suggests that the fees they were charging from the students so far were illegal. Before raising the fees, the institutes did not seek the ministryâ€™s approval, said the official.

The official also alleged that IIM-A had similarly hiked the society membership fees. According to IIM-Aâ€™s MoA, the society can hike the membership fees (for nominated members) only after framing the relevant bye-law.

The Central government has to be duly informed, the official said.

7,'Railway minister failed to keep his word',"KISHANGANJ: Railways'' dilly-dallying attitude in providing halt of Guwahati-Amritsar Express and 5933 Up/5934 Dn Jalpaiguri-Asansol/Sealdah Express at Kishanganj, notwithstanding categorical assurance of railway minister Nitish Kumar twice at huge rallies here, has rankled the train passengers.

After Union textile minister and BJP MP from Kishanganj Shahnawaz Hussain finally succeeded in cajoling the railway minister in providing halt of prestigious Guwahati-New Delhi Rajdhani Express in all seven days of the week at Kishanganj, stoppages of aforesaid trains seemed to be the logical corollary.

When the demand for the stoppages of Guwahati-Amritsar Express and NJP-Asansol/Sealdah Express was vociferously raised at huge rallies to flaunt the attainments of NDA government as also to compliment the railway minister for agreeing to stop Rajdhani Express, Nitish, while reciprocating the compliments, made it abundantly clear that once Rajdhani Express has begun to halt, there would be no hindrance for Guwahati-Amritsar Express and NJP-Asansol/Sealdah to halt here.

In a lighter vein, he had mentioned, ""Jab Rajdhani Express yahan ruk gayee, tab woh trains bhi yahan salami dekar jayenge (When Rajdhani Express did begin its halt here, these two trains too would).""

Few months later, when railway minister came over to Kishanganj to launch ""Raksha Kavach"" (anti-collision device), he again reiterated his consent for the same.

Chairman, Railway Board, GM, NF Railways and other top officials of board were also present at the time.

Oddly, these are the only two trains which still do not halt at Kishanganj while all other long-distance trains linking all the state capitals, like Thiruvanthpuram, Chennai, Banglore, Jaipur, Mumbai and Jammu do have their halts at Kishanganj.

Meanwhile, 3246 Dn Capital Express, shuttling between Danapur and New Jalpaiguri has sort of created a record by never adhering to its time-schedule.

While in its Up journey from New Jalpaiguri to Danapur, it always maintains punctuality, in Dn trip, it has never run on schedule, sources said.

According to railway sources, Danapur division has been overburdened with trains. Unless double tracking between Barauni and Katihar is completed, the snag could never be overcome, commuters said.

""If the tracks between Barauni and Katihar are not doubled, trains would always run late, causing harassment to commuters,"" a daily passenger said.

8,Police hunt on to arrest extremists: SP,"MUZAFFARPUR: Muzaffarpur district would require at least 150 companies of para military forces during Lok Sabha election if the government decided to provide one section of static force at each polling station of the district, according to SP Ajitbah Kumar.

Talking to TNN on Thursday, the SP said that there are only 1961 buildings for 2296 polling stations in the district. As a result, more than one booth might be located in many buildings and only one section of static force might be posted to control two-three booths.

So far as the availability of internal force is concerned, there are 900 district armed policemen (DAP) and 3,000 homeguards. Of them, only 600 DAP can be spared for election duty as the rest 300 would have to be posted at essential installations and establishments, the SP said.

One section of CRPF has already been engaged in patrolling work in MCC-dominated areas of Katra, Motipur and Sahebganj police stations.

The police are prepared to face the challenge of MCC before and during elections, the SP claimed and added that action is being taken in that direction. So far, 12 Naxalites have been arrested and 50 are named accused in Motipur encounter incident.

But in any case, the total number of Naxalites in the district might not be more than 100, he claimed. The police patrolling and their efforts to remove MCC domination in the area are going on side by side, he added.

The SP said the police have given top priority to arresting all the absconding professional criminals while executing pending warrants. Preventive arrests of trouble-makers would be launched soon. Under sudden checkings, drive against movement of arms and criminals has already been started in Muzaffarpur town area on daily basis and it would be launched in rural area within a week. Investigation of pending election-related cases has been accelerated.

The ensuing Lok Sabha election would be the third election duty of Ajitabh Kumar as SP after Saharsa and Naugachhia.

9,"PW, MCCI plan merger before polls","JEHANABAD: With Lok Sabha elections round the corner, two major Naxalite outfits, People''s War (PW) and the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) have intensified their efforts for an early organisational merger at the national level.

In keeping with their ideological opposition to parliamentary democracy, they have already set a violent agenda to thwart the election process giving a call for poll boycott.

According to available information, modalities for the merger between the PWG and MCCI are nearing completion and, in all likelihood, they would soon merge under a new name, All India Maoist Communist Centre (AIMCC).

Thus, acquiring a more militant reincarnation. Available reports suggest that the PW, with formidable military strength in the form of the People''s Guerrilla Army (PGA) at its Command, has been able to garner international support for its ""protracted armed struggle in its strongholds in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.

According to intelligence Sources, functionaries of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM) are supposed to be acting as mediators to strengthen the ultra left movement in India.

Given the significant increase in Naxalite activities in Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh following the August 11, 1998, merger of the PW with the CPI-ML (Party Unity) of Bihar, the proposed merger of the PW and MCCI seems to be fraught with dangerous ramifications over a vast landscape in the country.

This development has acquired much significance particularly in the context of coming Lok Sabha elections.

With the announcement of dates for the elections, the PW and MCCI have jointly called upon the people to boycott the elections and intensify armed struggle against ""state-sponsored terrorism"".

In a joint statement issued recently, state-level leaders of the PW and MCCI, Prakash and Prashant alleged that the ruling RJD in Bihar, in league with the forces at the Centre, had unleashed state violence, targeting the revolutionaries in the state.

10,DAV boy's suicide: Warden unaware of theft,"CHANDIGARH: The suicide by a DAV College student on Wednesday could perhaps have been avoided if he had brought the problem to the notice of the hostel warden.

Ravi Sharma, a class XII student, ended his life by hanging himself from a ceiling fan in his hostel room.

Ravi had asked his friends to forgive him in his suicide note and mentioned that he had not committed the theft of which they were doubting him.

Some of the hostellers told Times News Network that they never brought the issue to the notice of the hostel warden and were trying to sought it out among themselves.

The students said they approached the warden only in case of some major problem in the hostel.

""We generally do not interact with the warden on regular basis, therefore we were trying to solve the matter on our own. And, we never thought that he would commit suicide.""

Some of the hostellers said that boy was depressed after he was caught for the first theft of Rs 1,000 which he confessed to, and was further upset on Tuesday night when his friends blamed him for another theft.

His friends say that boy was very sensitive and used to get easily upset earlier, too.

The hostel warden could not be contacted.

Meanwhile, the Ravi''s family got his body released without postmortem examination and cremated it. His elder brother told Times News Network that the news came us a shock to them.

""He never told us anything. He had not come home for many days as he was busy preparing for his board examination.""

The family also could not give any reason as to why Ravi committed a theft when they were regularly sending him sufficient money.

11,Rana undeterred by anti-incumbency factor,"SURAT: Refuting the anti-incumbency factor likely to come his way, as levelled by the Congress, in the ensuing parliamentary polls in the Surat city constituency, the sitting MP and Union rural development minister Kashiram Rana, on the contrary, said that he having represented the constituency for five consecutive terms would, in fact, stand him in good stead, considering the party's unprecedented performance both at the local and the national level. Rana said that the election campaign in the state would be intensified from March 24 with several national leaders scheduled to camp here. Also, a mass contact programme would be taken up by the BJP in all parts of the state and efforts would be made to win all the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state, Rana said. In an attempt to woo the minority voters, Rana â€” taking the name of Mohammad Arif Khan who recently joined the BJP â€” said that many Muslim leaders have joined the party at many places. Those belonging to the minority community have started showing faith in the BJP and its allies in the NDA, he added. When asked about his chances of winning from the city, he said that he was not afraid of anyone from the Opposition. Even if Congress president Sonia Gandhi contests from here, it won't disturb him. He said that his party would campaign on a positive note and said that his endeavour would be to develop the Diamond City into an international commercial centre. When asked about the issue of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, he said that the issue along with Article 370 and Uniform Civil Code were BJP's agenda and not of the NDA, of which the BJP is only a constituent.

12,PIL against BSP's Pardafaash rally,"LUCKNOW: A PIL seeking direction against the district administration to restrain them from holding the Vishal Pardafaash Maharally on March 13 at Ambedkar rally ground, Jail Road is likely to be heard before the high court on Friday.

The PIL has prayed that the BSP chief Mayawati be restrained from holding the rally on Saturday. The PIL has been filed by a city lawyer Sangam Lal Pandey in the high court.

It has been urged in the PIL that the state government and district administration be directed not to permit any political party or organisation to hold any rally during working days.

It is alleged that the district administration had granted permission to hold the rally without considering that March 13 was a working day for schools and colleges and that annual examinations of high school and intermediate classes of UP Board, CBSE, ICSE and ISC were going on.

It was stated that the huge gathering of political workers would definitely disturb examinees and cause hindrance to the public in general in the nearby area and also in the city.

13,Army for law to check touts,"LUCKNOW: Army authorities have decided to request the government to enact laws in which ''touting'' for army recruitment should be declared a ''sedition'' with strict provisions of punishment.

The decision has been taken in view of increasing illegal activities of touts, who befool gullible candidates by promising them selection in recruitment rallies.

At present touts are booked under Section 420 of Indian Penal Code, which means fraud and forgery. They easily get bail and have been found to pick the ''trade'' after being release.

Photographs of some touts have been displayed by the Army recruitment authorities at the zonal office at the Central Command here with a warning for the candidates to remain alert from them.

Deputy Director General, recruitment, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal, Brigadier Rajendra Singh told newspersons on Thursday that these touts are indulging in activities which are against national interest.

The ramifications can be more serious as candidates getting recruitment through forgery can get involve in leakages of important documents related to national security, espionage, stealing of weapons and much more, he added.

Thus touting should be seen with different eyes in comparison to fraud for getting jobs elsewhere.

Touts have been a big problem for the Army in recent years.

In December last year, special task force of the state police had arrested three persons, who, in connivance with some employees of the zonal office of Army recruitment were found to be involved in providing fake mark-sheets and medical certificates to aspirants.

Brig Singh said that screening of the staff members, whose name had figured in the case, was being done and action will be taken soon.

He said that there was no scope of touts in the Army recruitment as the process of selection was foolproof. Earlier academic and domicile certificates were sent for verification to the concerned authorities.

""Now we are experimenting by inviting officials of various education boards and institutes in the state to verify the academic certificates submitted by the candidates at the rally site itself,"" he said.

15,Gujarat govt gives new spin to IIM row,"AHMEDABAD: In a fresh twist to the raging IIM controversy, the Government of Gujarat ( GoG) has suggested that a committee recently set up by it might look into the fee structure of IIM-Ahmedabad.

The Justice RJ Shah committee was appointed after a Supreme Court directive to fix the fee structure of self-financed management, engineering and medical institutes.

Gujarat chief secretary PK Laheri told The Times Of India: â€œWe do not want to be involved in the fee controversy.

But in light of the SCâ€™s ruling about self-financed institutes, there are larger issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, the Shah committee can take up the issue of fees at IIM -A.â€�

The Gujarat government, along with the Government of India and leading business families of Ahmedabad, formed the troika which established IIM-A.Two Gujarat government nominees sit on the IIM Society and two are on the board of the governing council.

These nominees, however, did not attend the meeting earlier this week where HRD ministry officials threw a tantrum. Laheri said that the state government representatives had been given a brief not to become a party to the ongoing spat.

On being told that the HRD ministry thought that IIM-A was a government-subsidised institute, Laheri said that IIM-Ahmedabad felt that it was a self-financed institute.

â€œNothing prevents the Shah committee from looking into the issue,â€� Laheri asserted. On the point that the SC ruling related to state-level institutes, whereas IIM was a national-level institute, the chief secretary said that â€œthis was not a problemâ€�.

This, because the state government had funded the establishment of IIMA and even now is involved in the management.

On being contacted, IIM-A director Bakul Dholakia said, â€œWe are a self-financed institute because our financial requirements are met through tuition fees and consultancy. Government grants are mainly for development work.â€�

He, however, thought that IIM-A did not come under the purview of the Justice Shah committee because â€œwe are a national instituteâ€�.

Justice Shah, when asked by The Times Of India whether the terms of reference of the committee decided by the apex court allowed it to look into IIM-Aâ€™s fee structure, replied, â€œWe will have to look into this closely.â€�
