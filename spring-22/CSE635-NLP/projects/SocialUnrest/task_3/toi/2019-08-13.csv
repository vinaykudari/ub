0,Digvijay inducts 14 ministers,"BHOPAL: The Digvijay Singh- led Congress ministry in the state was on Monday expanded with the induction of five cabinet ministers and nine ministers of state.

Six ministers of state, who earlier held independent charge, were promoted to Cabinet rank thus taking the number of those who were sworn in to 20.

Chief minister Digvijay Singh told reporters after the swearing-in ceremony that the expansion was meant to remove regional imbalances and improper representation to various castes that prevailed after Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh. Asked why he had taken such a long time to remove them, Singh said â€˜â€˜everything needs to be done at the right time â€˜â€™.

He said it was not possible to give representation to all districts in any state cabinet and added that it was the prerogative of the chief minister to select ministers. The five new cabinet ministers who were sworn-in are Prem Narayan Thakur, Bisahu Lal Singh, Choudhary Rakesh Singh, Ganpat Singh Uikey and Rajmani Patel.

The six ministers of state with independent charge, who were elevated to Cabinet rank are Govind Singh, Ghanshyam Patidar, Satyendra Pathak, Raja Pateriya, Bala Bachchan and Vir Singh Raghuvanshi.

While Thakur and Singh were ministers in Digvijay Singhâ€™s previous ministry from 1993 to 1998, Patel was a cabinet minister in the Arjun Singh government from 1980 to 1984 and Ganpat Singh Uikey was a minister of state between 1993 and 1998.

Choudhary Rakesh Singh, who has become a minister for the first time, is the only person from the upper caste to be inducted on Friday.

The nine ministers of state who were sworn-in are Aindal Singh Kansana, Kaushalya Gotiya, Babalul Malaviya, Surendra Choudhary, Raghuveer Singh, Sulochana Rawat, Tam Lal Sahare, Devendra Tekam and Saeed Ahmed.

Incidentally, Kansana has at least 38 criminal cases registered against him between 1974 and 1993. He was booked for cases ranging from attempt to murder, theft, robbery, wagon-breaking and possession of illegal arms. His name did not figure in police files after he became MLA in 1993.

2,12 arrested for desecration of shrines,"PUNE: The arrest of 12 members of a newly-floated Hindu outfit has thrown up many questions before the city police who suspect the organisation to be behind the recent desecration of Ganesh shrines here, besides the stoning incident that followed.

One Dhananjay Desai (23) of Mumbai, who is also the president of the outfit Hindu Rajya Sena (HRS), and his 11 accomplices have been arrested for stoning near the Ganesh Peth police chowkey on July 31, following the desecration of three Ganesh shrines.

Deputy commissioner of police (DCP-special) Sukhwindar Singh had got injured in the stoning.

The police produced Desai and his accomplices before judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) Ulka Joshi on Monday and demanded their custody for 14 days.

The police report claims that Desai was carrying a revolver at the time of the stoning incident and the accused are suspected to be involved in the desecration of the Ganesh shrines in the city.

The counsel for the accused, Bipin Patole, claimed that after the police detained five activists of the organisation, Desai and others had gone to inquire about them, but they were arrested.

Patole said that the police were trying to frame Desai and the other accused as they were unable to find the real culprits behind the stoning.

A senior police official said Desai moved to Pune from Mumbai around seven months ago and floated the outfit. â€œCurrently, the strength of the organisation is between 50 and 100 people and we are trying to find out the organisationâ€™s political affiliations and their goals,â€� the police official said.

3,Rent of govt flats may be hiked,"KOLKATA: The rent for accommodation in government housing estates is set for another increase, possibly just after the Durga Puja this year.

A rent revision committee is finalising the rates, state housing and public health engineering minister Goutam Deb said in Kolkata on Monday.

â€œThe rent for many of these flats have remained unchanged for over 30 years. A few years ago, I had doubled the rent. Another hike is imminent,â€� Deb said.

According to the minister, the government spends Rs 11 crore annually for the maintenance of these housing complexes. The government manages to recover only Rs 1.5 crore. â€œIf we can make up this deficit, more such lease housing projects could come up,â€� Deb added.

For these new projects, however, the rent would be higher and periodic hikes would be built into the lease agreements, Deb said.

Meanwhile, the PHE department has decided to extend the exisiting piped water supply scheme from street side posts to houses.

The Jagadishpur rural piped water supply scheme of the state government in Howrah would now be converted to a doorstep piped water pilot scheme. The project would be inaugurated on Tuesday by the minister.

Under this scheme, those who can afford it, would be able to bring a piped water connection straight into their homes by paying a refundable security deposit of Rs 2,000 and a monthly fee of Rs 30. Commercial units in the area would shell out Rs 2,500 as security deposit and Rs 50 per month for a similar connection.

The collection of the deposit and the monthly rent would be undertaken by local unemployed youth. The security money would be kept in a fixed deposit and 10 per cent of the monthly collections would be paid as commission to the collection agencts.

Currently, the PHE department has 135 piped water projects underway and has already completed 713 such projects. According to the department sources, over 2.6 million familes have access to piped water.

6,Notice to govt on law against sex tests,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to the Centre while responding to a petition which wanted changes in the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Tests (Restrictions and Regulations) Act as implementational excesses by authorities had put pregnant womenâ€™s health care in jeopardy.

The Bench, comprising Justice M B Shah and Justice D M Dharmadhikari, issued the notice after hearing arguments of counsel Kapil Sibal and B B Sawhney on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Indian Radiological and Imaging Association (IRIR). Counsel said Section 4(2) of the PNDTA provided for certain purposes for which the ultrasonography machines could be used though none of the abnormalities listed under the Section could be determined through ultrasound.

Sibal contended that the end result was that no ultrasound could be performed on any pregnant woman, howsoever grave was her condition.

Due to this, pregnant women in India were being deprived of a wide range of routine, preventive and beneficial diagnosis widely recognised and accepted in advanced countries.

He said the observations related to Jaitley''s alleged acceptance of a meeting of Tehelka people at Defence Minister George Fernandes'' residence, where they presented themselves as defence dealers and discussed about donation to the party.

He said Justice Manmohan Sarin in his order had further recorded that the other ""8-B noticees have also in their respective affidavits confirmed factum of the meeting with the petitioner and stated as to what transpired...."" in it.

""These findings of facts arrived at by the single judge are manifestly erroneous and not borne out from the record before him,"" Nigam said adding Jaitley had submitted that even the Tehelka tapes did not state that the news portal people had projected themselves as arms dealers.

10,"Release Yaseen, other political detainees: Jethmalani","NEW DELHI: After Kashmir Committee chairperson Ram Jethmalani met detained Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front leader and senior Hurriyat member Yaseen Malik on Tuesday, he demanded that the government release him and all the other political detainees.

Jethmalani said that this measure was necessary if the Centre wanted all elements to participate in the coming J&K elections. He was speaking to mediapersons after meeting Malik, who is amditted at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences here.

â€˜â€˜Nobody wants to contest elections from jail. Moreover, if they remain in jail during the elections how will it be free and fair?â€™â€™ he asked. He allayed all apprehensions about a security threat because of their release and said: â€˜â€˜Indiaâ€™s security is not going to break if it released 25 to 30 such persons.â€™â€™

About his talks with Malik, the former law minister said that the JKLF had a number of reservations about the elections. â€˜â€˜I will not pretend that I have overcome them. He has been in custody for such a long time that his perception is bound to be different,â€™â€™ he added. Advocating free speech by all elements, Jethmalani said: â€˜â€˜We must allow them full freedom of expression even if they have views against us. Freedom of speech is not for airing a thought similar to the one the government has.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Give them freedom to oppose the elections. The world will then say they are running away from the elections but we will establish our credentials,â€™â€™ said Jethmalani, who is going to the state on Friday for three days, to hold talks with various leaders, including those of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference and also with the J&K Democratic Freedom Party leader Shabir Shah.

Acknowledging that the Gujarat riots had made him feel ""sad, agonised and ashamed"", he said in an interview that Gujarat was a major example of ""helplessness"" for him in public life.

""As a President, I have often felt helpless, when so many delegations come to me and tell their woes and I can''t do anything about it. Gujarat was a major example of helplessness,"" Narayanan said.

He said something like Gujarat and the related communal issues have troubled him the most because it had larger implications. ""It affects the future of nation, unity of nation and I was most affected by events like that,""

17,Ex-spy threatens suicide,"KOLKATA: Mehabood Elahi is a man who has known brutal bondage. Accused of spying, Elahi languished in Pakistani jails for almost two decades before being freed in 1996.

Since then, he has made it his mission in life to fight for the freedom of Indian prisoners in Pakistan.

Elahi announced here on Tuesday drastic measures to draw attention to prisoners in Pakistan. He threatened to commit suicide in front of Parliament on August 30. Elahi has apparently been forced into such an extreme move after an unsuccessful nationwide cycle tour last year to press for the freedom of Indian prisoners.

For his living, Elahi practises astrology in Kolkata, where he lives with his in-laws. Elahi is also the president of a Kolkata-based society called Sangharsh Foundation, which has links with the BJP and Samajwadi Party.

â€œIf I fail to move the authorities at Parliament, I will make more attempts, even one in front of the Pakistani embassy,â€� Elahi said. He was arrested on June 23, 1977, while spying for the Indian government in Lahore. Double crossed by another Indian, he was picked up by the Pakistani authorities and spent years in special ISI cells. Elahi still bears the scars of torture.

On December 1, 1996, Elahi was finally released after the UNHRC intervened and a special board was constituted by the Pakistani government for Indian prisoners. â€œThen chief justice of the Pakistani Supreme Court, Naseem Hasan Shah, ruled that I had completed my sentence and should be released,â€� Elahi recalled.

In 1996, there were 1,335 Indian prisoners in Pakistani jails. â€œMany of them have gone mad and cannot even remember their names. There are prisoners of war as well,â€� Elahi said. Many among them are fishermen.

18,School principal held for charging capitation fees,"MUMBAI: The Santa Cruz police recently arrested the principal and trustees of M.P. Shah English high school at Vile Parle for allegedly collecting capitation fees from parents. They were released on bail the same day.

The school had reportedly been collecting fees under various heads, going against the rules of the education department. The Prohibition of Capitation Fee Act, 1987, says that collecting any fee not prescribed by the state government is illegal.

At M.P. Shah school, parents had been protesting against the extra fees charged for over the last two years. They had also lodged complaints with the education department, but no action was taken. Finally, one of the parents lodged a complaint on October 3 last year at the Santa Cruz police station. Acting on the complaint, senior inspector Vilas Tupe started investigating the matter.

He wrote to the education department seeking clarification on the matter and department officials confirmed that the action of the school was illegal.

â€œThe school used to charge Rs 300 as counselling fees, Rs 700 as cultural fees and Rs 50 as library fees. They are not supposed to charge these extra fees. We, therefore, decided to take action,â€™â€™ said Mr Tupe.

Since the offence of collecting capitation fees is a cognisable one, the management and the school principal filed for anticipatory bail in November last year. However, the anticipatory bail was rejected.

The police then filed a detailed report the court stating that the investigation was in progress and that they would give 72 hours notice in writing in case they decided to arrest the trustees and the principal.

The police collected evidence in the case for over seven months, and on July 19, they served the management and the principal with a notice warning them of arrest.

The accused again moved the court for anticipatory bail which was rejected. On July 21, they were arrested and released on a bail of Rs 1,000 each the same day.

Mr Tupe said that the police were in the process of preparing a chargesheet, which would be filed in a few days. School principal Daya Padbhan, meanwhile, said that there was a confusion about the fees.

â€œThe fees we charge are for extracurricular activities, for which we hire professionals to teach students different vocations like home science, electrical technology and dance. Whatever money we get from the students is paid to the professionals. The school does not earn a single paisa,â€™â€™ she said.

Ms Padbhan said that all her dealings with the parents were transparent and that the decision to charge fees under various heads was taken in consultation with the parents.

â€œWe had a Parents, Teachers Association (PTA) meet last year, where the parents approved our proposal. In fact, we had sent the minutes of the meeting to each and every parent,â€™â€™ she said. Even the parent who complained to the police about the extra fees paid those fees, she added.

19,"BJP, Cong trying to solve factionalism before polls","SHIMLA: With the countdown for the assembly elections scheduled for March next year, having almost begun, high commands of the two major political parties in Himachal Pradesh, have also started the exercise of putting their houses in order here in a bid to get the better of the other.

Ironically, both the Congress and the BJP in Himachal Pradesh are plagued with a common problem â€” factionalism. While the Congress is divided into what are called the Virbhadra Singh and the Vidya Stokes factions, the BJP is split into the Dhumal and Shanta Kumar groups.

The Congress high command recently held a meeting in New Delhi where the CLP leader Virbhadra Singh and the HPCC chief Vidya Stokes were both called. It was made clear to both that they sink their differences and put up a united front, to ensure that the existing factionalism did not come in the way of the party coming to power in the state.

However, sources close to Virbhadra Singh said that the CLP leader made it clear to the party high command that it would be near impossible to remove the factionalism within the party in the state till the pending complaints against the alleged anomalies in the party organisational elections were removed. While they claimed that an assurance to effect had been given, the names in the recently announced charge sheet and election manifesto committees endorsed that the Congress high command was all out to restore parity within the groups in the state.

Likewise in the BJP supporters of chief minister P K Dhumal and Union minister for rural development Shanta Kumar are not mincing words to air their views publicly. Shanta Kumar, who was recently in town, held a meeting with chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal alongwith one Madan Dass Devi, a high RSS functionary, who had been specially deputed to bring about a rapprochement in letter and spirit between the two leaders.

The coming six months could be crucial for the two parties in the state, and to quite an extent the party that can bridge the divide as quickly as possible, has the better chances at the hustings.

20,Widespread rain raises Punjab farmers hopes,"CHANDIGARH: Heavy to moderate rainfall on Monday and Tuesday in the central and western districts of Punjab has raised hopes of the stateâ€™s farmers who had been struggling to protect their crops from the drought by over-exploiting ground water at a very high cost.

Drought hit Haryana has also been experiencing widespread rain for the last couple of days. The local meteorological office here reported that Amritsar had 129 mm, Ludhiana 37 mm and Patiala 88 mm rainfall during the last 36 hours.

Meanwhile, temperature too fell by three to seven degrees below normal across Punjab. The quantum of rainfall in the entire state has been still far short of the normal rainfall in August yet it was quite relieving considering that it followed the driest July in the last few decades. Experts feel the present spell of rainfall would be sufficient for the next couple of weeks in the areas which have experienced more than 50 mm rain this week. The rains have reduced the irrigation requirements and hence the power requirement has also come down and there are likely to be fewer power cuts. Also, the rains are a boon to the farmers who were operating their tube wells on costly diesel in the absence of power. The rainfall however has not improved the reservoir level substantially as the inflow has not picked up fast, perhaps because of absence of rains in catchment areas. The water level at Bhakra was 1615.83 ft â€” slightly higher than last yearâ€™s level of 1612 ft. The inflow was around 46,000 cusecs â€”nearly the same as that on this day last year.

But water level at Pong was just 1,303 ft â€” about 45 ft below last yearâ€™s level while at the Ranjit Sagar Dam (RSD) it was 23 metres lower than last yearâ€™s level. The inflow at both Pong and RSD too remained lower than the inflow last year on this day.

Outflows from the reservoirs are still being kept low to conserve water for the Rabi crop and there is no threat of any floods to warrant release of large quantity of water.
