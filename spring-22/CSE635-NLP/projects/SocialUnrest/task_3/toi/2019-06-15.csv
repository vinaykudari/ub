2,BJP in a bind to name ministers,"LUCKNOW: Even after holding several meetings, the BJP finds itself in a bind to shortlist names for its quota of ministers to be included into the first cabinet expansion, likely to take place next week.

The much-awaited expansion has been put off at least thrice on the BJP request as the party was finding it difficult to finalise names. Indications are available that about 40 to 50 ministers are to be included to complete the coalition cabinet.

The BJP already has nine ministers in the Mayawati cabinet and it will have about 23-25 seats more to fill the quota. Since the party will have to leave 5-7 seats to accommodate ministers of its allies, it may be left with only 17-18 seats to fill its own quota.

The BJP dilemma is that there are about 17 former ministers who returned to the assembly again and are formidable candidates. Also in the queue are about a dozen senior leaders and new legislators who are aspiring to have â€˜Lal Battiâ€™ first time.

The party has already faced a rebellion when Raja Bhinga Chandramani Kant Singh and two other party MLAs had raised a banner of revolt for their non-inclusion into the coalition cabinet. They had even threatened to vote against Mayawatiâ€™s trust vote on May 17. The rebellion was subdued with an assurance to look into their claims during first cabinet expansion.

Since then, the party state leadership has held three meetings to shortlist names but has been unable to give the list a final shape. The party is finding it a double-edged exercise, dropping former ministers and inducting new faces or other claimants in the expansion. The issue was deliberated twice at the meetings held on Thursday. But party leaders failed to come to any conclusion on the list of candidates.

When former finance minister Harishchandra Srivasatva â€˜Harishjiâ€™ was not included into the Mayawati cabinet on May 3, it was thought that he might be dropped. But Harishji made several trips to Delhi and showed no reluctance to take up the ministerial berth again.

Besides Harishji, there are 16 other ex-ministers who have a â€˜rightfulâ€™ claim to be inducted again in the cabinet. Prominent among them are Dr Narendra Singh Gaur, Dr Nepal Singh, Premalata Katiyar, Shivakant Ojha, Fagu Chauhan, Dharmpal Singh, Satish Mahana, Lallu Singh Chauhan, Fateh Bahadur Singh, Chandra Kishore, Gulab Devi, Dr Ganga Bux Singh and Jitendra Kumar Jaiswal.

Unable to muster courage to bear brunt of dropping rightful and formidable claimants, the BJP is under tremendous pressure from new aspirants who are clamouring for the ministerial berth. In view of the rebellion last month, the party is left no choice than to accommodate few new faces.

The list of aspirants is long. Party general secretary Ramapati Ram Tripathi, the only Jat MLA Kunwar Bhartendra Singh, Dr Laxmi Kant Bajpai, Rajesh Agarwal, Jata Shanker Singh, Rajendra Pratap Singh alias Moti Singh, Ghanshyam Shukla, Ajai Rai or Krishanand (from Ghazipur), Jai Pratap Singh, Ram Pratap Singh (Gonda) are among those aspiring for a Cabinet berth.

Moreover, claims of MLAs from Bara Banki, the area represented by former chief minister Rajnath Singh, can also not be ignored. Raj Laxmi Verma and Rajrani Rawat have put up their claims to fill up the vacant slot.

Most of these aspirants come from unrepresented areas and fulfil the caste criterion. Caught between the devil and the deep sea, the BJP leadership may leave it on the party central leadership to put its seal on the list to save itself from facing the legislatorsâ€™ wrath.

4,Tota Singh arrested for corruption,"BATHINDA: A Vigilance department team from Chandigarh arrested former education minister Tota Singh at about 3 pm near a sub-jail at Moga on Friday where the former minister had gone to meet his one party worker.

According to sources the minister have been arrested for his alleged involvement in the purchasing of bad quality paper worth over Rs 5 crore by the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) during his tenure as education minister. The paper was used for examination answer sheets and text books published by the board.

A case has been formally registered at the vigilance police station SS1 Mohali.

There are four main charges under which Tota Singh has been arrested: for possessing property worth Rs 10 crores which is disproportionate to his source of income; for manipulating recruitments in the education minister during his tenure as education minister; for interfering in the internal affairs of PSEB; and for taking commissions in purchase of textbooks and paper by the PSEB.

Tota Singh has reportedly been arrested after a sampling of paper at scientific laboratories found the paper of very poor quality as per the parameters set up by the Indian Standards Organisation (ISI).

The vigilance department had reportedly collected the samples of the paper lying unused in the store of the board and sent it for sampling to the laboratory for checking quality. The paper was reportedly purchased from a firm by a purchasing committee of the board constituted by the former minister.

Tota Singh was in Moga on Friday to organise a dharna to protest against the arrest of Kuldeep Singh Gill, the municipal president, Moga, who was arrested by the Moga police on June 13 on the charges of fraud.

Tota Singh was nabbed by the Vigilance team from Chandigarh when he had gone to met one Jugraj Singh, an Akali party leader of Daudhar village.

The Vigilance team took Tota Singh in his own Quallis car to Chandigarh and asked his bodyguards, Jasvinder Singh and Dara Singh, to inform the Moga police about his arrest.

The vigilance team was led by Nacchatar Singh (inspector, vigilance) and he was assisted by a DSP of the Moga police. When the vigilance team reached Moga, they contacted the Moga police which helped them locate Tota Singh, disclosed Varinder Singh, the SP, Moga.

Elected as an MLA from the Moga constituency to the 12th state assembly in the February poll, Tota Singh was indicted sometime back by Punjab Lok Pal on the charge of irregularities in recruitment of teachers during his tenure as state education minister in the Badal government.

5,"RSP, FB criticise agri policy","KOLKATA: Differences within the Left Front over the new agriculture policy came to the fore on Friday as LF MLAs from smaller partners joined the opposition in criticising policies to woo multinational com-panies and promote commercial farming in the state.

Only 3 per cent of the countryâ€™s land, pointed out Abdur Rezzak Mollah the land reforms minister, is in West Bengal and agricultural land is even less. Therefore indiscriminate use of cultivable land for industry and urbanisation, he cautioned, would affect supply of foodgrains. The government is alarmed over increasing use of agricultural land for fish-eries, brick kilns, industry and tea gardens etc, he added.

RSP member Tapan Hore and Forward Bloc member Paresh Adhikary roundly criticised the government for encouraging American multinationals and accepting their plans for commercial cultivation and contract farming.

Trinamul Congress MLA Dipak Ghosh accused the government of indis-criminate transfer of land to â€˜favourite industrialistsâ€™. â€œ Now land sharks are eyeing rural land and the communists have started talking about com-pulsions of globalisation,â€� he sarcastically added.

6,"Drop unruly official, minister told","DANAPUR: The railway officers of the Danapur division of the Eastern Railway expressed resentment over alleged uncouth behaviour of Mahendra Singh, assistant personal secretary (APS) of the minister of state for railways Digvijay Singh, with a senior official of the division recently.

In a letter to the minister, the aggrieved railway officials urged him either to drop him as APS or take necessary action against the controversial Singh for his misconduct with the senior most official.

According to sources, the high profile APS was travelling by the Rajdhani Express (2310 Dn) from New Delhi on Sunday. Suddenly the air conditioner (AC) of the second AC coach stopped working in which he was travelling.

However, the fault in the AC coach was repaired at Manpur and the passengers heaved a sigh of relief.

Perhaps, not happy with the functioning, Singh held senior divisional electrical engineer (senior DEC) Ranjan Srivastava of Danapur accountable for the development of snag in the AC coach on the ground that the primary maintenance of the Patna bound Rajdhani Express is done in Patna only.

Thus, on his arrival in Patna on Monday morning the enraged APS gave a good dressing down to the senior DEC on phone. He asked the senior DEC to see him immediately in Patna failing which due action will be taken against him.

The shocked and dismayed railway official told the Danapur DRM about the alleged threats to him by the APS. The Railway Officersâ€™ Association (ROA) of the Danapur division was also informed about the incident on Monday.

According to a railway official, the APS who is much below the rank of senior DEC, has no right either to abuse him or summon him directly to any place. It is sheer misuse of power if he does so and it is tantamount to gross indiscipline and violation of the railway service code as well, he said.

When contacted, senior DEC confirmed the incident and said that the AC was not completely off, but the cooling was not up to the mark due to a minor fault.

Meanwhile, Singh who was not available for his comments, was in the thick of controversy last year when he illegally occupied the retiring room at the Patna Junction for about two months and incurred loss of railway revenue up to Rs 1 lakh.
