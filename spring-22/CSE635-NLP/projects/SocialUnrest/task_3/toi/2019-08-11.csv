0,Endorse PM’s word on polls: Shah to Kalam,"NEW DELHI: The Jammu and Kashmir Awami National Council led by former state chief minister G M Shah, has demanded that President A P J Abdul Kalam must endorse the assurance given by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of holding free and fair elections in the state.

Once the President of India, who is the custodian of the Constitution endorses the Prime Ministerâ€™s assurance, ""it would mean assurance from over 100 crore people of India to their brethren in J&K,"" G M Shah reportedly told the Kashmir Committee, headed by former law minister Ram Jethmalani.

At a meeting with the Kashmir Committee, which now has the blessings of deputy prime minister L K Advani, the Awami National Council spokesman Muzaffar Shah also demanded ""decisive and transparent action by the Election Commission to reassure people that the Presidential assurance is being translated.""

In order to ensure a credible monitoring mechanism, Shah suggested that two independent boards â€” central and state â€” be set up, ""each comprising eminent public figures like former Prime Ministers, retired Chief Justices of Supreme Court, non partisan prominent public, political and media personalities to work in tandem with the EC to oversee the elections.""

1,Govt's education policy draws flak from schools,"MUMBAI: The governmentâ€™s skewed education policy and arbitary decisions have caused much confusion and problems for the school children.

This was illustrated by the recent fracas over school fees, said Ramakant Pandey, principal of the Bansidhar Agarwal School at Wadala.

While the government could have easily worked out a uniform structure for all students, it linked fees to parentsâ€™ income and made it applicable only in aided English-medium schools, instead.

This sparked vociferous protests that brought students into the streets.

Ultimately, the state was forced to reverse the decision.

Such retractions only lend credence to principalsâ€™ complaints that policies are formulated arbitrarily, without consulting academicians or parents.

â€œIt shows a lack of vision,â€™â€™ said Fr Pravin Fernandes, spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Bombay and the Archdiocese Board of Education, which monitors 136 educational institutions.

This randomness is reflected even in the state policy for recruiting teachers, said H.N. Pal, administrator of the J.J. group of schools.

A couple of years ago, the government decided to hire teachers on contract, at salaries as low as Rs 2,500.

This resulted in a decline the standards of those joining the profession. Even teachers eligible for higher pay under the fifth pay commission scales found that their salaries were routinely delayed by two months or more and that the arrears they were to receive remained only on paper.

If this isnâ€™t bad enough, teachers are often signed up to conduct census surveys and similar work.

â€œThey are just not motivated any more,â€™â€™ said the head of a suburban school.

The state government, course, denies that its policies are arbitrary. â€œTwentyone per cent of all expenditure in the state is incurred on education.

Last year, we spent Rs 8,000 crore on school education, which is one the highest budget allotments in any state,â€™â€™ said school education secretary J.M. Phatak.

Maharashtra was one of the few states implement the fifth pay commission scales immediately, he said, and added that the stateâ€™s contract teachers were among the best paid the country.

However, academicians are not convinced. For them, one oft-repeated phenomenon exemplifies the governmentâ€™s callousness.

Noted Fr Fernandes, â€œWhenever any government is formed, the education portfolio just hangs the air.

No one wants it.â€™â€™

2,Schools confused over State's education policy,"MUMBAI: Thereâ€™s one thing that wizened school principals dread more than pesky pranksters and noisy classroomsâ€”receiving yet another government resolution.

These innocuous-looking notifications donâ€™t come punctuated with red marks, but their contents,which spell out the whims and fancies of successive state governments, have made principals as wary of circulars as students are of report cards.

They just seem to confirm the opinion of educationists that the government regards schools as a convenient target for its ever-changing plans.

â€œWe have an arbitrary education policy,â€™â€™ said Gool Ghadiali, principal of New Era School at Gowalia Tank. â€œThere is no continuity, and various resolutions are just thrown at us at odd times.â€™â€™

Last month, the school education department threw up another surprise, announcing that the eight-year-olds who study in standard four will have to take a board exam. Principals and parents described the decision as outrageous.

The announcement is part of a series of government experiments with examinations. Five years ago, the state decided that it would be best if children didnâ€™t take any exams at all.

Then it declared that teachers should evaluate each of the 70-odd students in class every day.

Belatedly recognising that teachers couldnâ€™t keep tabs on so many students, the state put school exams back on board. Now, in a final effort to â€œimprove the quality of educationâ€™â€™, the government has decided to test the proficiency of eight-yearolds in maths, general knowledge and the social sciences.

In the bargain, children have been forced to conform to a new method of assessment and learning almost every second year. â€œWe are perplexed,â€™â€™ said Ms Ghadiali. â€œI wonder what they will do next.â€™â€™

Academicians say that the exam controversy reflects the insensitive manner in which the government treats education.

â€œThere is no conscious, organised effort to frame an education policy, taking into consideration the needs of students, teachers and society in general,â€™â€™ said A.R. Motlekar, former president of the Mumbai Heads Association.

The state has not even bothered to keep pace with the national policies on education under which, for instance, it was suggested that there should be no exams for children up to standard nine. Added Mr Motelakar, â€œThe government seems to think more of its treasury and takes a decision only when it can benefit.â€™â€™

3,"No gain from pump scam, says excise minister","NAGPUR: Maharashtra minister for state for excise, food and drugs Anil Deshmukh on Saturday denied being a beneficiary in the petrol pump scam as alleged by Union petroleum minister Ram Naik.

Addressing a press conference here, Deshmukh, a senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, clarified that he had owned a 1.5-acre plot at Dumri, 30 km from Ramtek, in the district, which has been sold to Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) two years ago.

Showing a copy of the transaction, Deshmukh said neither he nor his son or any relative was allotted a petrol pump anywhere in the country.

â€œProbably, Naik simply relied on information provided by party activists from the district and is defaming me without even bothering to verify facts,â€� he said.

4,Venkaiah calls on partymen not to seek govt favours,"MUMBAI: BJP president Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday asked higher functionaries the party and government refrain from seeking favours for themselves or their family members from the government.

â€œI plan to begin an internal debate on this issue in the party,â€� he said, while addressing his first press conference as party president here.

He outlined several measures to rejuvenate the party organisation, in an obvious bid to overcome the current despondency following the exposure of the petrol pump scam.

The BJP president gave Union petroleum minister Ram Naik a clean chit, saying â€œthere was no need to defend Naik, who has been in public life with utmost transparencyâ€�.

Naik had done no wrong, he maintained.

He castigated the Congress and observed that it must have been already repenting since the petrol pump issue was boomeranging on it.

Dozens of Congress leaders had written to Naik, asking for allotments of petrol pumps and gas agencies to their supporters, he charged , and showed a letter written purportedly by Congress general secretary Motilal Vora.

Blaming the Congress for the stalemate in Parliament, Naidu said democracy meant resolving issues through discussions. â€œWe are ready to face Parliament.

But the Congress and the Left do not want any discussion,â€� he alleged.

On President A.P.J.Abdul Kalamâ€™s proposed visit to Gujarat, Naidu said he was against dragging the office of the president into any controversy.

There was nothing wrong if Kalam wanted to visit Sabarmati Ashram, the earthquake-affected areas or some other places, he said.

When pointed out that several hundred people were still living in relief camps in Gujarat, Naidu shot back:

â€œLakhs of displaced Kashmiri pandits were still living in Delhiâ€™s camps for years.

But nothing was said to sympathise with them. Of course, this did not mean that some people in Gujarat should live in camps.â€�

He claimed the situation in Gujarat was now almost normal and the people of the state must be given the opportunity to elect a popular government.

Criticising the opposition in Parliament, Naidu said they were still not reconciled to the fact that an RSS swayamsevak was the Prime Minister.

On every possible opportunity, the opposition had been disrupting Parliament, be it Ayodhya, Pota, Gujarat or petrol pump allotments.

The opposition had no concern for the drought in the country, the massacre of the Amarnath pilgrims or flooding in many parts, he added.

Naidu said the BJPâ€™s membership now exceeded three crores.

The rank and file would be revitalised through five regional gatherings, starting from August 27, in Bhopal. Subsequent gatherings will be held in Bangalore, Kolkata, Jaipur and Guwahati.

This will later be extened to other places.

5,Rs 1 lakh cash incentive for loco shed staff,"VIJAYAWADA: Impressed by the performance of the railway electric loco shed and wagon workshop at Guntupalli near here, Union minister of state for railways Bandaru Dattatreya announced a cash award of Rs 1 lakh each to the two units.

Dattatreya inspected both the units on Saturday and reviewed their performance. The locomotives maintained at the electric loco shed ran up to 4.10 lakh km without any failure while the national average is around 3 lakh km. As many as 900 wagons are being repaired every month at the wagon workshop currently.

The Union minister said the award amount would be distributed to the personnel working in both the units. Earlier, the minister reviewed the performance of the Vijayawada Railway Division with South Central Railway general manager S M Singla, Vijayawada division manager R Ramanathan, senior divisional commercial manager T Prabhakara Rao and other officials.

He also visited the Vijayawada railway station and inspected passenger amenities. Later talking to reporters, Dattatreya said a sum of Rs 1.71 crore was being spent this year on provision of more amenities at the Vijayawada railway station. A second entrance-cum-ticket booking counter was coming up on the eastern side of the station while the foot-over-bridge connecting various platforms is being widened at a cost of Rs 57 lakh.

Referring to the Vijayawada railway yard remodelling project, the minister said more funds would be sanctioned so that the work could be completed by 2004. The third railway bridge across river Krishna between Vijayawada and Krishna Canal Junction would be ready by December end while the approaches would be completed by March 2003.

Four road-over-bridges would be completed by March 2003 at Chirala, Palakollu, Krishna Canal-Kolanukonda and Guntur-Vejendla, he said. The new railway divisional headquarters at Guntur will come into operation in 2004, Dattatreya said adding that the nearly 337 km from the existing Vijayawada Railway Division, 137 km from the Guntakal Division and 114 km from the Secunderabad Division would come under the new Guntur Railway Division.

Meanwhile, the railway minister took part in the Chaduvula Panduga programme at Sisu Vidya Mandir High School at Satyanarayanapuram here and later addressed a media workshop organised for the Bharatiya Janata Party workers.

6,Delhi Metro's second phase gets govt nod,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state government has finally cleared the second phase of the Delhi Metro project â€” scheduled to come up between Delhi University and Central Secretariat. Now the line will be extended upto Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar in the north and Rangapuri on the Mehrauli-Mahipalpur Road in the south.

In the east, the line will connect Noida to Barakhamba Road in the city centre, said Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) director (projects and planning) C B K Rao. He said the project, to be built at an estimated cost of Rs 6,300 crore, will be completed in five years time.

7,EC should focus only on elections: Jaitley,"NEW DELHI: Taking exception to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) J M Lyngdohâ€™s focus on relief and rehabilitation measures in Gujarat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday said there are several relief commissioners (RCs) to do that job and that the Election Commission (EC) should concentrate only on elections.

The attack on the EC comes at a time when Lyngdoh, along with colleagues TS Krishnamurthy and BB Tandon, returned to the Capital after an assessment of the situation in riot-hit Ahmedabad and Vadodara. On arrival, Lyngdoh told newspersons that ""a decision on the assembly elections would be taken in a couple of days"".

Contrary to the CECâ€™s earlier observation that the situation was not normal, BJP general secretary and in charge of the state Arun Jaitley said here that 98 per cent of the state was ""normal"".

He said, ""In some areas, relief and rehabilitation may still be required and it must be expeditiously done. The relief commissioners must do their job and the EC its own.""

""The EC should bear in mind the Constitutional requirement of Article 174, which mandates that the next sitting of the state assembly has to be called in early October,"" he said here.

""The job of the EC is to conduct elections,"" he said, adding, ""I hope they are able to announce the dates at the earliest.""

Jaitley, who visited the state a few days ago, said most riot victims have returned home, and trade, business, political and educational institutions and life have become normal.

""It would be a bad precedent to suggest that elections can be deferred,"" he said. ""We have gone through elections during terrorism in Punjab, we have gone through elections and still going through the elections in Jammu and Kashmir even under the shadow of jehadi guns.

""We have gone through elections with a minuscule voting percentage in Assam and yet elections restored normalcy in Punjab and Assam.""

He said elections in Kashmir would also send a message to the entire world that despite terrorist threats, people of the state expressed faith in Indiaâ€™s sovereignty through ballot.

""In comparison, it would be too far-fetched to suggest that elections cannot be held in Gujarat even though the state had been normal for past several months,"" Jaitley said.

Terming the Godhra carnage and the resultant violence in many parts of the state as ""unfortunate"", he said everyone should bear in mind that 98 per cent of the state was ""unaffected by the violence"".

When asked whether election-related exercise like preparation of the voters list had been done, Jaitley said,

""The draft electoral rolls were published in February 2002 and the final rolls in May 2002."" ""No wholesale revision is, therefore, required. If individual additions and deletions are required, the same can be done pending elections as has been done in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said.

8,BJP to expose Cong on pump allotments since 1983,"MUMBAI: Ten days after the petrol pump controversy, the Mumbai unit of the BJP seems ready to take on the Congress in an effort to shore up the reputation of the Vajpayee government.

The campaign, which is to be launched on Independence Day, will expose the corruption in the distribution of petrol pumps and gas agencies since 1983,when the Congress was in power at the Centre.

The BJP strategists are clearly worried that the petrol pump issue could hurt the party in Gujarat and want to launch a campaign to embarrass the Congress. Party chief Venkaiah Naidu finalised the anti-Congress campaign during talks with senior members on Saturday.

9,Market row bodes ill for Cong govt,"AMRITSAR: Confrontation between the business community and officials of the excise and taxation (ET) department, that began after the recent raids conducted by the department, may hurt the stateâ€™s Congress government which has already come under flak from employees of various departments.

The furious business fraternity is all set to â€˜â€˜teach them a lessonâ€™â€™ for their alleged â€˜dictatorialâ€™ functioning. Raids over two days by excise and taxation officials in the wholesale markets of Amritsar led to scuffles, attacks, gun threats and filing of police cases by both sides and ended with political intervention.

It was reported that minister for excise and taxation Sardool Singh Bandala and additional excise and taxation commissioner Krishan Kumar were present at Circuit House and issued instructions over cell phone to the raiding parties to generate maximum revenue.

As many as 45 different trade organisations, including textiles, arhtiyas, transporters and karyana, are going on strike in Amritsar from Monday while the sarafa association would hold state-wide strike in protest against the alleged unlawful and indiscriminate raids and manhandling of shopkeepers, said Amrit Lal Jain, president of Punjab Pardesh Beopar Mandal, while talking to Times News Network here on Sunday.

He also blamed Taranjeet Singh, assistant excise and taxation officer, for allegedly adopting double standards. Speaking over a local cable channel, he claimed all businessmen had cooperated with the raiding parties but in the FIR lodged at Kotwali police station, the former had stated they were manhandled by shopkeepers.

The businessmen are also annoyed at MLAs Jugal Kishore Sharma and Raj Kumar who did not bother to attend the meeting of various trade organisations held on Saturday. Darbari Lal, deputy speaker, Punjab Vidhan Sabha, and Om Parkash Soni were present in the meeting while Harginder Singh Thekedar arrived towards the end of it.

Jain said if their demands, including withdrawal of cases filed against businessmen, removal of Krishan Kumar and taking into confidence of trade leaders before conducting raids, were not met, another meeting of state trading bodies would be convened at Jalandhar to chalk out their future course of action.

10,Monsoon blessings: too little and too late for farmers,"HARDOI: Even a casual observer on the Lucknow-Hardoi road will not miss the impact of drought which has left thousands of acres of land parched-dry. The monsoon rain on Saturday and Sunday though may help farmers to some extent but it can not undo the damage caused to the standing crop.

30 kms from Lucknow, at Malihabad, farmers and others idling at the Mirzaganj crossing were a perturbed lot, not for losing their crop but for their orchards where mango saplings were wilting for want of water. If the saplings did not get water now, they would not grow into healthy trees, said Rashid Qayamat Khan, popularly known as Saddu.

Rashid said it was not the question of losing a crop or two, but if Mango trees were gone, the identity of Malihabad would be in danger. He said there were 200 tube-wells in the area, but only 25 of them were in working condition.

These tube-wells, he said, had become a big problem for the farmers. On an average, installation of one tube-well costs round about Rs 15,000. â€œAnd, if these do not serve the farmers, how will they pay back bank loans?â€� Rashid Khan said.

A few kilometres ahead on the road, dozens of able-bodied youths looked dejected because most of them were without work for days together. If the situation remained as grim, many would move to big cities where they would end up pulling rickshaws or working as porters, Kaushal Singh said.

Two canals, one at Muhan Road and the other called Chhoti Nahar, are dry. At Amaniganj, near Mohanlalganj, thousands of acres of land do not have even a leaf of grass over them. The residents of Amaniganj recalled that this area was considered a rice-bowl of Uttar Pradesh till the last year.

Owner of a pesticides shop on the Circular Road, Hardoi, Chhote said that forthe last one month his shop had no customers. His stock of paddy seedlings, peanuts and urad had no buyers, he lamented.

A casual look at the Galla Mandi, Hardoi, spoke volumes about the impact of drought. More than a hundred tractors loaded with grains used to come to this mandi on every alternate day, till a few months ago, according to Anil. But, now, hardly a tractor trudged towards the mandi, he recalled. This mandi used to cater to the needs of the entire district and scores of villagers from Majhora, Hariyanwa, Nayagaon and Madara would continuously flock to this mandi but not now, Anil said.

An affluent farmer of Hardoi, Tej Pratap Singh, said his land used to yield 90 quintals of cane per bigha but this time it would be hardly 20 quintals per bigha. But Singh said he would weather this calamity, â€œmay be, by selling his well-stocked grains. But what about others?â€� he asked.

A resident of Ram Nagaria village, Ram Swaroop Pandey said that with the yield per bigha likely to be around 10 per cent of the normal, the cost for hiring a tube-well to water his fields would become highly uneconomical.

Nandu Lal of Lalpalpur said that the government assistance of Rs 500 per bigha was nothing, especially in view of the enormity of the loss caused by the drought.
