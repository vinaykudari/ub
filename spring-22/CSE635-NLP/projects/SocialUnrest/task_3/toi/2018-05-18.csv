""since, they have used cellphone to establish contact with their buyers and middlemen, it is easier for us to identify the others involved in the racket,"" the police said. a case of cheating has been registered against the duo in the upparpet police station. chinappa is a real estate agent in mathikere. he gets the computer printouts of fake question papers and jayaprakash supplies them to the students, the police said. the police laid a trap for the duo and called them to s.p. road where they were arrested. according to preliminary investigation reports, the accused have collected rs 50,000 from the cet seat aspirants through this deal. cet cell officials are surprised that students and parents continue to approach and believe touts despite repeated warnings against such practice. in fact, the cet brochure even has a column warning parents and students. such cases of cheating also happen during admissions. ``persons claiming rapport with the cet cell officials may promise to get a course and a college of the student's choice and make quick bucks. ``we would like to assert that such a thing is not possible,'' the brochure says. when a student comes to select a seat during the admission process, he/she is allowed to select a course and a college from among those available on the electronic display board. the opportunity to make such a decision will be given strictly in the order of the ranking which is based on the marks scored by a student in the cet and the qualifying examination. ``nobody can tamper with this even if lakhs of rupees are paid. we hope the arrests made will prevent students and parents from approaching touts,'' the cet cell officials hoped.
