0,MPs demand Togadia's arrest under Pota,"NEW DELHI: VHP leader Pravin Togadia's ""trishul diksha"" (trident distribution) programme came in for strong condemnation in both Houses of Parliament on Monday with angry opposition members demanding his arrest under Pota. Raising the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, angry members of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress accused Togadia of disrupting communal harmony by conducting ``trishul diksha'', stating that this was despite Deputy Prime Minister Advani's reported statement that such a programme should not be undertaken. SP leader Ramjilal Suman said that after Rajasthan, Togadia had gone ahead with the programme in Delhi. He added that this was being done to whip up communal passions to gain political mileage in states which are due to go to the polls later this year. He also said that a few youths, who were staging a demonstration demanding that they wanted jobs and not trishuls, were mercilessly beaten by VHP volunteers. Given the serious repurcussions of his action, Suman said Togadia should be arrested under Pota immediately. Suman was supported by Pravin Rashtrapal (Congress), who pointed out that Advani owed an explanation to the people as to why Togaida was allowed to go ahead with his programme in the Capital since he (Advani) is responsible for the maintenance of law and order in Delhi. He also condemned the arrest of the Delhi Youth Congress chief for protesting against the VHP's ``trishul diksha'' programme. Rashtrapal alleged that trishuls were being sold during the ``diksha'' programme to volunteers and said the open sale of arms was creating a law and order problem. He accused the ruling BJP and the NDA government of patronising the VHP's programme. Satyavrata Chaturvedi (Congress) pointed out that programme conducted in Delhi showed that the BJP wanted to polarise society on communal lines. The opposition's demand and charges were firmly rejected by BJP chief whip V K Malhotra who maintained that the programme had gone off peacefully. Recalling that Aurangzeb had banned trishuls during the Moghul period, Malhotra said it is now the turn of the opposition to do the same. The issue was also raised in the Rajya Sabha with the opposition also condemning the Union government for allowing Togadia's trishul distribution programme in state after state. Led by Suresh Pachouri, Congress members demanded Togadia's arrest under Pota. They wanted to know what the government was trying to achieve in standing by and allowing the programme to continue, as it did on Sunday in Delhi itself? Parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj said she would convey the members' feelings to the DPM. But the opposition said this was not enough and Congress leader in the House Manmohan Singh said he wanted an official statement on the issue.

1,Cricket with Pak only if political pitch improves: Minister,"LUCKNOW: â€œThe political pitch needs to improve before we can contemplate playing with Pakistan on the cricket pitch,â€� seems to encapsulate the sentiments of the government as far as the proposal for re-initiating cricketing ties between the two nations are concerned. Vikram Verma, Union minister, youth affairs and sports, on Monday categorically denied that there was any possibility of India playing the arch rivals until diplomatic atmosphere was not conducive.

â€œDespite recent overtures of friendship, until the cross-border tensions cease it is difficult to explore cricket as a medium of friendship. Pehle Pakistan apna nazariya badle, tab hi hum apni nazar badal sakte hain. Pakistan must re-think its policies then we can reconsider ties. How can we send our boys to the country, given the impediment of security concerns?â€� he reiterated.

According to Verma, despite the fact that India played Pakistan in the recently held World Cup in South Africa, in the current context of non- existent diplomatic association, playing in a neutral nation is also not possible and in this we believe we have the support of the cricket lovers of India. He also dismissed BCCI presidentâ€™s Jagmohan Dalmiyaâ€™s request for resuming cricketing ties with Pakistan saying that as a cricketing board they were concerned only by limited aspects of the game whereas the government needs to take a holistic view of the relationship with the neighbouring country. â€œHence at present status quo is being maintained,â€� he said.

4,Laloo-minister spat rocks Rajya Sabha,"NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha witnessed noisy scenes on Monday when RJD leader Laloo Prasad Yadav accused Doordarshan of deliberately not telecasting his â€œlathi rallyâ€� at Patna and demanded the resignation of information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.

â€œDoordarshan has become â€˜Ravidarshanâ€™. The moment Ravi Shankar Prasad lands in Patna, the local DD Kendra starts telecasting his engagements. But, in case of the RJD rally it cited technical reasons for not showing the report though all private channels had direct telecast,â€� Yadav said.

Yadav charged that Prasad had terrorised the staff of Patna Doordarshan Kendra to ensure coverage of his activities in Bihar. â€œThis should be thoroughly probed and the minister should be removed. This is blatant misuse of power and Doordarshan,â€� he said.

The minister shot back, saying it was very well known to him who had misused official powers.

5,Sena opposes HPCL disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena, a constituent of ruling NDA, on Tuesday said it opposed privatisation of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), saying the aggressive initial bids by certain foreign companies revealed ""dangerous motives"" to get a foothold in the strategic oil sector.

The expression of interest for sale of the government''s 34.01 per cent stake in HPCL has seen foreign companies putting in ""threateningly"" aggressive bids and the government should ensure that foreigners are not allowed in this strategic sector, Shiv Sena member Sanjay Nirupam said during a discussion on the Finance Bill in Rajya Sabha.

Repeatedly stating that oil was a strategic sector, he said bids by Saudi Arabia''s state-owned Saudi Aramco and Petronas of Malaysia were ""dangerous"".

Saudi Aramco and Petronas are among the eight companies shortlisted for sale of government equity in HPCL.

""The EoIs have seen foreign companies racing ahead of Indian firms. This is a dangerous development... one can understand (Royal/Dutch) Shell and BP Amoco putting in aggressive bids but Saudi and Malaysian companies showing undue aggressiveness is indicative of dangerous intentions,"" he said.
