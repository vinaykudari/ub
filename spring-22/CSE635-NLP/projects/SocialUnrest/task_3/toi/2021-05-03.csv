0,Protest votes permissible under rules: EC,"NEW DELHI: Though EC has not provided with the ''none-of-the-above'' option, Kiran Mehta of Mumbai wanted his protest to be registered.

Help came from a woman staff who took out a rule book and said Mehta can mark his protest. By then Mehta''s forefinger was inked. Not to worry, she told him. In the voters register (Form 17A in EC parlance), he was made to countersign the entry â€” ''Not Voted''. ""I ensured that my vote is not misused,"" Mehta says.

But can the process be misused? Deputy Election Commissioner AN Jha says what Mehta did is permissible under the election rules. ""Misuse,"" he says, ""is not possible."" Jha explains that the presiding officer activates the EVM for voting only after the voter has been cleared by three persons.

In case of voters who want to register a protest vote, the machine will not be activated if the voter apprises the officials about his intention. Once he leaves, the next voter will take over.

1,"Are judges, ministers above law?","NEW DELHI: In view of recent cases, top functionaries of two vital organs of the state â€” the legislature and the judiciary â€” seem to be above law.

Needless to say, former SC Chief Justice J S Verma''s words that ""be you ever so high, the law is above you"" have had little effect on them.

After the apex court ruled that legislators, including ministers, are public servants, it was assumed that ""criminal and corrupt"" legislators and ministers would be treated like tainted bureaucrats. However, the reality is otherwise.

Punjab deputy CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa continue to hold offices though they are facing corruption charges. If a non-minister bureaucrat was in a similar situation, he or she would have been suspended.

The law seems to ignore the fact that every citizen â€” irrespective of the position the person holds â€” is equal under the Constitution.

The judiciary has highlighted this time and again. While sending former UP CM Kalyan Singh to ""symbolic"" imprisonment (for defying SC''s directive to keep the precincts around the Babri mosque and Ram temple intact), SC had ruled that the CM''s post was like that of ""the chief executive officer"".

The camaraderie of Punjab and Haryana HC judges in going on en masse leave, to protest against HC chief justice''s legitimate intervention in a case where two judges had availed membership of a ""disputed"" resort, has raked the debate on how to ""discipline judges"".

SC as well as one of the protesting judges had criticised the government and public sector employees for going on strike. Yet, a section of the judiciary brought the justice delivery system to a grinding halt at a time when there is a huge backlog of cases.

2,"Minorities returning to party fold, claims Congress","LUCKNOW: Claiming that the minorities were returning to its fold, the Congress on Sunday said the appeal by Imam of Delhi''s Jama Masjid Ahmed Bukhari asking Muslims to support BJP will have no impact on the Lok Sabha elections.

""Bukhari does not enjoy support of the community and his fatwa in favour of the BJP will have no impact in the election,"" senior Congress leader and chairman of minority cell of the party C K Jaffar Sharif told reporters here.

""The minorities have returned to the Congress,"" he said, adding that though the minority community was unhappy with the party over some issues it had never distanced itself from the Congress.

""The minorities return to the Congress fold will have its effect in the Lok Sabha election results,"" he claimed.

The party is getting support of not only the minorites but all sections of society in these polls, he said.

3,GNLF Cong support muddles Hills politics,"DARJEELING: The muddled pre-poll politics in the Hills took a surprising twist on Sunday when Gorkha National Liberation Front supremo Subhas Ghisingh asked all party units and supporters to support the Congress candidate in Darjeeling.

Ghisingh''s ""appeal"" -coming in the midst of localised GNLF calls to boycott polls and containing an ambiguous reference to the ""political stand for a separate state of Gorkhaland"" - resulted in all-round confusion, with neither the Congress nor the CPM (apparently the prime gainers and losers) risking any comment.

Unexpected as it is, the announcement may ultimately end up helping the CPM because the confused voter may bank on the Left, which already has a committed base of cadres and voters.

Ghisingh''s call may also be directed towards keeping the Congress happy and keeping open a channel of communication with the national leadership, say political observers.

The People''s Democratic Front, the bloc of which the Congress is a part, issued a belligerent response. PDF president Madan Tamang said Ghisingh had ""surrendered to the pro-PDF wave"" but still needed to be ""watched"" as he was a ""crooked"" man.

Ghisingh''s appeal, in the form of a signed media release, referred to the Hills'' ""old relationship with Congress"" and stressed that the appeal owed more to the party''s ""hand symbol"" rather than the Congress candidate himself.

A mention of the ""present scenario in the country"" and a tantalising reference to the ""political stand for a separate state of Gorkhaland"" accompanied the appeal.

Only GNLF Darjeeling Branch Committee president Deepak Gurung offered any kind of explanation - not very illuminating at that.

""The Congress has not spoken against the GNLF; it''s only the other parties in PDF that want to outwit us. It is our democratic right and we can support anyone,"" he said.

The GNLF units of Tukvar and Mirik are reportedly asking people not to vote in the coming elections. Besides, the party''s trade-union front, the Hill Plantation Workers'' Union, has also called for a boycott of the polls in the cinchona-plantation areas, making things a trifle too confusing for the average voter.

Things are likely to get clearer - or a little less muddled - on Tuesday when GNLF holds a public meeting in Darjeeling.

4,Labourer's suicide takes political hue in Moga,"MOGA: The suicide by a labourer working at the shop of a Congress leader has taken a political colour as some political parties have threatened agitation if strict action is not taken against the accused by May 7.

A case under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (abetment to suicide) has already been registered at Mehna police station of the district against the accused Satnam Singh Sandeshi, the vice-chairman of farmers'' cell of the state Congress. However on an application of the accused the additional sessions judge has stayed the former''s arrest till May 7.

A dalit youth Karam Singh resident of Madoke village near here had committed suicide by consuming pesticide a few days ago. He was employed as tola (weighman) at the shop of Satnam Singh Sandeshi situated in grain market Dhudike. It was alleged that Karam ended his life due to intimidation by Sandeshi.

It was also alleged that some senior Congress leaders tried to hush up the matter but following strong protest by some labour unions, the police booked Sandeshi. He however succeeded in getting interim bail as the district police did not arrest him due to his alleged political connections.

It is reported that while the Congress leaders of the area are doing their best to resolve the issue by compromise, the opposition parties and Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union (PKMU) are demanding strict action against the accused and compensating to the dependents of the deceased to the tune of Rs. 5 lakh.

The SAD and some other parties have declared a protest march and rally at Moga on May 7. The PKMU has already started mobilising the villagers of the area against the Congress government.

On the other hand Satnam Singh Sandeshi alleged that he was implicated in the case under a deep rooted conspiracy by the leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Badal to tarnish the image of Congress party in view of the Lok Sabha elections. He alleged that SAD workers were instigating labourers against him and his party.

5,Executive arrested for cheating,"PANCHKULA: The economic offences wing (EOW) of the district police arrested an executive of an immigration consultancy for allegedly duping a local resident on the pretext of getting a business visa for New Zealand.

Rohit Sikka was booked in a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust registered against him at the Sector 5 police station on the directions of the court. Sikka was arrested on the night intervening Sunday and Monday.

Chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Gulab Singh on Monday remanded him to judicial custody while turning down EOWâ€™s request for police remand.

Sikka has been accused of not returning the money taken by him as fee for getting the visa. Besides this, it was also alleged that Sikka had committed breach of trust by not submitting the complainantâ€™s papers in the Embassy. He is also alleged to have furnished false confirmation number of the receipt of papers in the Embassy.

""Besides effecting the recovery of case properties some vital information has to obtained from the accused, hence custodial interrogation of the accused was required,"" the public prosecutor informed CJM while producing Sikka in the court.

The defence counsel while pleading innocence of his client opposed the police remand by saying that he had been falsely implicated in the case at the behest of the complainant who had filed a false affidavit in the court to get the case registered. The defence counsel also presented papers to substantiate his claim. Acceding to the defence counselâ€™s request the CJM turned down EOWâ€™s request of police remand. The defence counsel also moved Sikkaâ€™s bail application which would come up for hearing on Wednesday.

7,No 'feel good' at Advani’s rally,"NEW DELHI: A motley crowd of 3,000-odd people at the deputy prime minister L K Advani''s rally, barely-filled RTVs ferrying people to the meeting venue, the proudly fluttering BJP flag on either side of the bus as incongruous with the indifferent faces of the passengers within, as the feeble ""zindabad"" following the lusty cries from the dais, for outer Delhi BJP candidate Sahib Singh Verma.

If these snapshots of Lal Krishna Advani''s first election rally in Najafgarh in Delhi for the 14th Lok Sabha elections are anything to go by, BJP''s prospects in the coming elections may not give the party too much to feel good about.

Advani steered completely clear of controversial issues, choosing instead to focus on the ""administrative abilities"" of Vajpayee, the country''s ""progress in the last six years on NDA rule,"" and how a vote for Sahib Singh would also mean a vote for the prime ministership of Vajpayee. ""Give us another mandate and by 2020 we will make India a fully-developed nation,"" he promised.

Commenting on the exit polls predicting a fall in NDA''s fortunes, he said: ""If they were all that accurate, we would not have come to power in any of the four states where Assembly elections were held last December.

The only people who were happy to see these results were certain leaders in Bihar, who would get a chance to exercise their wheeling-dealing tactics in case of a hung Parliament.""

He set to rest speculations on whether BJP, if able to get the mandate, was eyeing a single-party government. ""Even if the BJP gets a majority, the government will be formed by NDA.""

Projecting Vajpayee as the only alternative to the ""political instability prior to 1998,"" Advani stressed that ""BJP has never believed in votebank politics because this causes an increase in parochial outlooks like casteism and communalism.""

He went on to add how bishops and imams had been a part of the flagging off ceremony of his Bharat Uday Yatra, blaming the opposition for ""giving BJP a communal image"".

The crowds that had assembled fairly late in the day (Saket MLA Vijay Jolly and TV-star Vani Tripathi had addressed several rows of empty chairs at the back), though, seemed little interested in Advani''s narration of the ""autocracies"" of the Congress at the time of the emergency.

The only time the sporadic clapping gained a wee bit in decibels was when he talked of Virendra Sehwag''s triple hundred. Not even Jolly''s bantering ""Jo nahin bolega woh Pakistani"" could elicit a decent response from the crowd.
