0,NDA ministers beat a retreat,"NEW DELHI: After five years of power and glory, NDA ministers beat a retreat on Thursday evening. Or so it seemed.They had begun to say goodbye and started to vacate their offices even before the axe had actually fallen on them. While many took this exit with a pinch of salt, some cursed the pollsters and pundits. Destiny, they thought, had defied wishful thinking.No sooner had the trends made it amply clear on Thursday afternoon that there was no chance of return of the NDA government, the ministers began the painful process of vacating their plush offices â€” pulling down personal photos, collecting files and other personal articles and stacking them in the corridor.According to some ministry officials, while the process of moving files and personal articles from the offices began on Thursday afternoon itself, it picked up momentum on Friday.""We know our fate. What''s the point of waiting any longer,"" said a senior minister on Friday. The scene at various ministry offices â€” Krishi Bhavan (housing agriculture, food and civil supplies, rural development), Udyog Bhavan (heavy industries, iron and steel), Nirman Bhavan (health, urban development), Sanchar Bhavan (IT), Shastri Bhavan (I&B, chemical & fertilizer, coal, mining) resembled that of a pack-up at the end of a party.All through the day till late evening, additional private secretaries (APSs), officers on special duty (OSDs) and other personal staff of ministers were seen loading files, photos and other personal items on the cars of respective ministers. They seemed to be in a hurry to ferry, as the red-light laced cars too would vanish soon.""It''s a routine thing here and we are used to this transition of power. Regardless of our political leanings, we have to go about our jobs of ensuring that government property is not pilfered,"" pointed out a peon at Nirman Bhawan.However, checking the items being taken away, he claimed, was a difficult task as office property like petty pen stands, ashtrays, wall hangings often tend to be carried away by enthusiastic personal staff.The next phase, point out officials, will soon begin when the residence offices of the ministers will be dismantled. Air conditioners, computers, fax machines, photo-copiers, phones and all other items brought in at the click of the minister''s finger will get a tearful send-off.""While most ministers refuse to vacate their official residences hoping to reverse their predicament, some are brazen enough to continue using the gadgets provided to them,"" said a ministry official pleading anonymity.The ministers, of course, need to realise that all good things come to an end.",NEW DELHI
1,New challenge for Cong-NCP Govt in assembly polls,"PUNE: The narrow victory margins in Maharashtra are telling their own story, profiling the changing political environment at the grassroots.

Erosion of strength in the traditional vote banks, the emergence of new players such as the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) in Maharashtra and a split in the Maratha and backward caste votes is clearly evident from the Lok Sabha election results in the state.

This could mean a new challenge for the incumbent Congress-NCP government during the forthcoming assembly elections in the state.

Specifically in western Maharashtra, NCPâ€™s loss to the Shiv Sena in Khed and narrow victory margins in Satara and Kolhapur is a cause of concern for the NCP-Congress as it indicates the growing influence of the Shiv Sena-BJP in this Congress heartland in Maharashtra.

NCP president Sharad Pawar''s performance of winning nine of the 18 seats contested by his party in Maharashtra is not impressive considering that the Congress-NCP fought the elections unitedly.

In fact, in three of these nine seats, Pawarâ€™s candidates won narrowly- by 4,043 votes in Satara (Laxmanrao Patil), by 12,545 votes in Hingoli (Suryakanta Patil) and by 14,753 votes in Kolhapur (Sadashivrao Mandlik). In the 1999 polls, Mandlik had won this seat by one lakh votes.

Pawar admitted on Thursday that while the drought conditions had an impact on Solapur and Osmanabad constituencies, his party fared poorly in Vidarbha because of candidates floated by the BSP and the SP.

""The alliance was trailing on seats in Vidarbha and Marathwada and preliminary analysis indicates that the BSP factor has had an impact on our performance"", Pawar said at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday.

The narrowest victory margin in the state was in Osmanabad where Kalpana Narhire of the Shiv Sena defeated NCPâ€™s Laxmanrao Dhobale by 1,649 votes.

Prominent candidates who lost narrowly in the state included Maharashtra chief minister Sushilkumar Shindeâ€™s wife Ujjwala from Solapur (5,798), NCP spokesman Praful Patel from Bhandara (3,009 votes) and veteran Congress leader Prabha Rau in Wardha (3,188 votes).

In 14 of the 48 seats in Maharashtra, eight candidates won by margins under 10,000 votes and the remaining six with margins under 15,000.

In Sangli, although Congressman Prakashbapu Patil returned to the Lok Sabha for a fifth term, his victory margin of 81,000 votes was half of what it was in the 1999 polls (1.60 lakhs). Patil was pitted in a triangular contest against the BJPâ€™s Deepak Shinde and Samajwadi Partyâ€™s Nagnathanna Nayakwadi who drew a substantial 1.37 lakh votes.

The anti-incumbency factor, poor management of co-operative sugar factories in the region coupled with acute drought conditions have been among the factors that influenced voter behaviour.

Hence the Congress- NCP were unable to get the expected results despite coming together in the elections. The presence of candidates of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in places like Solapur and Osmanabad also added to the Congress- NCPâ€™s problems.

The concentrated efforts by the BJP leaders like state president Gopinath Munde to woo the OBC and Dhangar communities also had an impact. In January, Dhangar community leader Prakashanna Shendge was inducted into the party fold at a massive rally at Pandharpur in the presence of prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The decline in Republican Party of India leader Ramdas Athavale victory margin from 2.62 lakhs in 1999 to One lakh in 2004 is linked to this strategy that resulted in the shifting of votes from the Congress-NCP-RPI combine to the BJP.

Although the Congress- NCP tried to play the Maratha card by trying to inflame sentiments over the Chhatrapati Shivaji- James Laine controversy, the effort seems to have fallen through.

2,Was Atal pushed into early polls?,"NEW DELHI: The last meeting of the Vajpayee Cabinet on Thursday saw NDA''s usually eloquent convenor George Fernandes stumped for words.

Asked about the resolution adopted in the meeting to place on record the team''s appreciation for its leader, Fernandes could not say anything for nearly 10 minutes.

Was the silence reflective of the collective grief over NDA''s defeat or did it denote a sense of regret for pushing the leader into a battle he would have preferred to fight later?

Though a full-house diagnosis of the debacle is scheduled later, many in BJP are debating whether party strategists erred in preponing polls and dumping allies whom Vajpayee would have liked to carry along into the battle.

The popular belief in BJP is that he did not want to bring forward the polls. He was forced to do so by strategists, who were drunk on feel-good hubris following the victory in assembly polls in three states.

3,Was Atal overruled on poll allies?,"NEW DELHI: Vajpayee was reportedly reluctant to advance polls. But the BJP thinktank influenced Advani, making it difficult for Vajpayee to resist.

Some in the party deny this, asserting that the timing of the polls was a collective decision. They argued that the impact of the win in assembly polls could have lost the edge if LS elections were held on schedule.

The wisdom of forcing an early poll was always a matter of dispute, but it rankles more after the electoral debacle.

Many feel the leadership''s complacency and the ineptitude of the much-vaunted backroom boys evened out the advantage of catching the political rivals unprepared.

Vajpayee was reportedly also not keen on jettisoning the DMK, which looked set to tap into the discontent against Jayalalitha.

He, however, had to give in after S Gurumurthy prevailed over Advani and others to bring Jayalalitha into the NDA fold. That single move fetched Congress a tally of 40 seats.

Vajpayee also failed to convince others on aligning with regional players in Assam and Haryana. Citing the confidence of local units, party managers rebuffed the overtures of AGP and HVP.

Similarly, he failed to have his way on the use of Sonia Gandhi''s ""foreign"" origin as a poll issue. Ignoring Vajpayee''s plea, leaders like Narendra Modi, Pramod Mahajan and Vinay Katiyar insisted on using it as the main fodder against Sonia.

It''s believed now that Vajpayee''s defiance, apart from deflecting the attention from the feel-good theme, helped Congress gain sympathy.

4,Thackeray blames NDA's poll loss on disinvestment,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray said that the BJP-led NDA government lost in the Lok Sabha elections because of its disinvestment policy.He told newspersons here on Friday that his party has been consistently opposed to disinvestment, especially for profit-making PSUs. In this respect, said Thackeray, the Sena shared its viewpoint with Left parties and demanded the scrapping of the policy vis-a-vis profit-making units.It may be recalled that the Sena had caused considerable embarrassment to its ally, the BJP, by accusing the government of corruption in the disinvestment of the Centaur Hotel near Santa Cruz airport.Thackeray also said the dilution of the Hindutva agenda was resented by people. The Sena-BJP alliance had organised a movement around the issue of building a temple at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. But over a period of time Hindutva was more or less forgotten and this made people wonder if the ideology had been abandoned, he said.He alleged that the Congress-NCP combine had won on the basis of casteist propaganda. The combine had used the controversy over American author James Laine''s book on Chhatrapati Shivaji to rally Maratha votes.However, sources in the Sena said infighting within the party and the lack of unity between Sena and BJP also played a role in the poor performance of the alliance, especially in Mumbai, where it lost in five of six seats.There was a lot of resentment within the Sena over the fielding of Sanjay Nirupamin Mumbai North-West even though he was already a member of the Rajya Sabha.â€œOur leaders talk of promoting the sons of the soil and yet they gave Nirupam, a Bihari, a ticket,'''' a Sena activist noted.The activist also stated that a Sena MLA belonging to the anti-Manohar Joshi camp did not work with enthusiasm for the party in Mumbai North-Central.Joshi was defeated by political lightweight Eknath Gaikwad. In Mumbai North-East, a prominent Sena leader simply did not campaign for sitting BJP MP Kirit Somaiya.",MUMBAI
5,Why parties should discount pollsters,"NEW DELHI: Statutory warning: Political crystal ball gazing is dangerous and can cost you office. That sticker could be pasted on all forthcoming exit polls, given the embarassingly off-course projections most of them made.

None came close to giving Congress a figure that would put them within fighting distance of prime ministership, yet three days after all the punditry, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was swept away from office and Sonia Gandhi was buffeted by a tsunami of popularity towards becoming India''s next leader.

What happened? Political scientists and some psepholgists themselves have cautioned against taking exit polls too seriously given that measuring political behaviour is always tricky, but how did all the surveys remain wide off the mark.

The best an exit poll gave Congress and its allies was between 190 and 205 seats by the NDTV-A C Nielsen poll. The final tally for NDA stood at 188 seats, nearly 90 less than its previous tally and Congress and allies at 219 seats.

Most exit pollsters have to do a rush job, trying to cover as much ground as possible on voting day, explains Kalyanmoy Chatterjee, who until recently was a vice president of a leading Indian market research company.

Chatterjee said because of logistical constrains, most pollsters remain either in urban areas or close to motorable roads, so they can move fast. ""But that''s not where the real India lives.""

Another researcher for AC Nielsen, which tracked voting for NDTV, said only 55%-60% of any given constituency is surveyed and hence regional variations can yield widely different outcomes.

Also the sample sizes of exit polls probably aren''t large enough to be representative in a field of 625 m voters.

Structural constrains aren''t the only stumbling blocks. In India, many voters don''t take kindly to being asked directly about political preferences.

In most cases, if asked they prefer the safer option of indicating the ruling party, which gives the incumbent a false sense of popularity, says Chatterjee.

Most exit pollsters, however, overcome that impediment by using ballot papers and asking voters to tick their choice and put it in a box.

Now some leading pollsters,faced with added complexity brought on by the emergence of regional players, advocate a review of the methodology in choosing the sample, which may not remain homogenous to its larger population because of the change in a political leader''s affiliation or other factors.

6,"NDA, RJD now change stand on development","PATNA: After its disastrous electoral show in Bihar, NDA has started saying that development is a non-issue in elections. Strangely, it is the victorious RJD and its allies which disagree.

""Why didn''t they raise the issue of corruption this time? It''s because they themselves are involved in scams,"" remarked RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, while recalling the days when he was ""victimised"" for the fodder scam.

He, however, maintained that development is an issue before the people. ""But not the ''feel good''-type development advocated by NDA,"" he added.

Even chief minister Rabri Devi''s brother Aniruddh Prasad alias Sadhu Yadav, who has won the Gopalganj Lok Sabha seat with a big margin of votes, said development is an issue.

""The work I had been doing for Gopalganj town for the last four years was visible to the people, who, cutting across the caste line, said they wanted me to develop the entire constituency the way I had done in the case of the town,"" he told TNN.

The newly elected Congress MP from Madhubani Shakeel Ahmad alleged that NDA''s development plank was a media creation.

""None of the Union ministers from Bihar could retain their own seats. Even Nitish Kumar and George Fernandes won because they shifted to other constituencies,"" he said, adding that the people of Bihar have punished the Union ministers because in the name of fighting Laloo, they portrayed Bihar as a state where anarchy prevailed.

Incidentally, NDA took Mithilanchal, which has six parliamentary seats, to be its stronghold.

Maithili''s inclusion in the Constitution''s Eighth Schedule and the construction of a railway bridge over the Kosi river at Nirmali were aimed at boosting NDA''s popularity in the region.

But National Democratic Alliance failed to retain even a single seat in the region. ""The booklet issued by BJP candidate from Darbhanga Kirti Azad referred to schemes which were not visible at the ground level,"" Ahmad maintained.

""The development advocated by NDA was not felt at the grassroots level,"" remarked the new RJD MP from Jhanjharpur Devendra Prasad Yadav.

He said Maithili is spoken just by a particular caste. ""What matters more for the people of Mithilanchal are recurring floods, abnormal rise in diesel and kerosene oil prices and issues relating to day-to-day life. The ''feel good''-type development advocated by NDA related to just two per cent of the population,"" he observed.

The newly elected MPs of the RJD-led alliance insisted that right social combination is important. ""But so is development,"" Ahmad remarked.

7,Trinamul man kills self after election debacle,"HOWRAH: Unable to bear his party''s humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, a Trinamul Congress worker committed suicide in Howrah on Thursday night.

Twenty-six-year-old Sukumar Ghosh took his own life at his Pipilai home in the Domjur police station area. He was a primary member of the party and an ardent supporter of Mamata Banerjee. He was actively campaigned for Bikram Sarkar, Trinamul Congress candidate from Howrah.

''We got the information that upset over the Trinamul Congress'' poor performance in the polls Sukumar Ghosh committed suicide. We are verifying it,"" said ASP, Howrah (Rural), Hari K Kusumakar.

According to Sukumar''s friends, he was watching election results on television with other Trinamul supporters at a neighbouring club since morning. He got quite depressed as the news of the party''s defeat kept pouring in. By the time he left the club, he had stopped speaking to anyone. At home, he skipped dinner and quietly slipped into his room.

When the early-riser did not come out of his room till late on Friday morning, his family members got suspicious. They broke open the door and found Ghosh hanging from the ceiling fan. No Trinamul Congress leader, however, visited the bereaved family.

8,Depressed TDP candidate commits suicide,"ANANTAPUR: K M Rahmatulla, the failed TDP candidate from Anantapur Assembly seat, shot himself dead with a licensed revolver at his home in Ramanagar on Friday morning.

He was said to have been depressed after his defeat in the elections.

According to K Lakshmipathi, a close friend and eyewitness, Rahmatulla had been depressed for the past three days. The younger son of former TDP MP K M Saifulla, Rahmatulla had been fielded to bag minority votes.

However, he lost to sitting Congress MLA B Narayana Reddy by over 37,000 votes. His election had run into problems because TDP rebel Y Prabhakar Choudary had refused to quit the race and bagged more than 24,000 of the votes.

Family sources said Rahmatulla could not get over the defeat as he had spent a large amount of money on his campaign. Relatives had planned to take him to Bangalore to get him treated for depression.

Saying he was going to get his bag, Rahmatulla reportedly went into his bedroom and locked himself from inside. He then shot himself in the temple.

Lakshmipathi, who was in the hall outside, heard the shot and broke the door open. Rahamathulla was shifted to a nursing home where doctors declared him brought dead.

Sources said Rahamathulla''s wife also attempted suicide by dousing herself with kerosene but family members saved her.

9,"CPM, CPI in a dilemma over joining govt","KOLKATA: The two Communist parties in West Bengal are caught in a dilemma over the question of joining a Congress-led government at the Centre.

Left Front chairman and CPM politburo member Biman Bose said in Kolkata that the nature of the support that LF would extend to the Congress would be decided at a meeting of front constituents in Delhi between May 15 and May 17. The CPM politburo, central committee and the CPI national council would also hold separate meetings to plan the next course of action.

Bose and CPI state secretary Manju Majumdar said both the parties were willing to extend support to a Congress-led government.

Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh, who had earlier advocated a line of equidistance between the BJP and the Congress, felt that in the present situation all Left parties should support the Congress-led alliance in forming a government.

Since there is no possibility of forming a ""third front"" now, the LF has to support a Congress-led government to prevent the NDA from returning to power.

Keeping in view the political situation in West Bengal, state LF leaders had ensured that the crucial meeting in Delhi took place in their presence. ""After all, most Left MPs are from our state,"" Majumdar said.

The problem faced by the state CPM is that the Congress was its opponent party in West Bengal. The same holds true for the Congress too, acting PCC president Pradip Bhattacharya said. ""If we come too close, it may be politically suicidal for both the parties,"" he said.

LF leaders indicted that opinions were divided â€” not only among the partners, but even within the parties â€” on the question of joining the government.

The government would be more stable if the Communists decide to join, but politically it might be suicidal for them to participate in a government that might have to take crucial decisions on liberalisation.

The CPM and the CPI would ask for a common minimum programme on the basis of which the future Congress-led government would run.

This is necessary for the Left parties even if they decide to support the government from outside. The cornerstone of the CMP would have to be economic policies which were acceptable to the Left parties.

One thing the Left parties would like to ensure in exchange of the support to the Congress is that the central government would bail the state out of the current financial crunch.

11,Left to debate rightness of joining govt,"NEW DELHI: CPM and CPI, the two major parties in the Left Front, would debate the issue of joining the new government on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

There are indications that the two would take a joint decision and are not keen to join a Congress-led government.

CPI leaders A B Bardhan and D Raja called on CPM leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet on Friday to discuss the issue.

Senior leaders in both parties said they would take a collective decision â€” that is, if CPM decides not to join, CPI would abide by it. CPI leaders said they are not keen to join the government.

The central leadership of both parties will, however, be guided by their respective decision-making bodieswhich can even decide to join the government.

While leaders of CPM and CPI are debating the issue, veterans Jyoti Basu and H S Surjeet, it seems, feel the Left should join the government.

Apparently, they are influenced by ""well-wishers and friends"" like V P Singh who say the Left should look beyond West Bengal and Kerala and play a national role.

12,Cong to 'size up' govt in few days,"NEW DELHI: The exercise to determine the size of the Congress-led coalition and participants in government is expected to gather momentum as soon as ongoing informal exchanges are concluded.

Senior Congress leaders Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh, Ahmed Patel, Kamal Nath and Vyalar Ravi are busy meeting the like-minded parties to gather support for the Congress-led government.

The process of meeting to be held over the weekend or early next week will clear the picture of the parties that will join the ''secular'' Congress-led government.

Once that is done, the Congress alliance, with its current constituents and additions have met, the government formation would follow.

There have been a series of meetings involving CPM general secretary Harkishan Singh Surjeet and Congress leaders over the inclusion of Samajwadi Party in the new government.

Former Prime Minister V P Singh who called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi also suggested that numerical requirements alone must not determine the composition of the government.

The party is still not clear about the inclusion of Samajwadi Party in the government. The decision to include SP will be based on the opinion of it''s other allies who fear that the Cabinet pie may shrink if new parties are taken on board.

There is also a degree of bitterness in the party over the manner in which SP fielded candidates against Congress outside UP.

Congress leaders say that the UP unit does not favour any association with Samajwadi Party. If Congress is to regain its previous standing in UP, they say, the party has no choice but to oppose SP. On whether there could be a deal with the BSP is not clear. Perhaps Congress would be careful about antagonising the SP to such an extent.

NCP leader Sharad Pawar met Sonia Gandhi to assess said that he would act to ensure that there was a stable government at the Centre. On the question of participation in government, he said that would require discussions within NCP.

The NCP leader would have to reckon with a few sobering facts. Shiv Sena-BJP alliance in Maharashtra has lead Congress-NCP 25-23. NCP had six seats in the previous Lok Sabha and this has only marginally increased to nine.

14,Scrap Disinvestment Ministry: CPI,"NEW DELHI: Notwithstanding the Rs 100,000 crore loss in market capitalisation at the bourses on Friday, the Communist Party of India on Saturday said it wants scrapping of the Disinvestment Ministry and favours selective privatisation of bankrupt public sector firms through the Finance Ministry.

""Disinvestment Ministry should go. If anything (PSU) has become bankrupt, dispose it of. For that you don''t require a Ministry. A separate Disinvestment Ministry gives an idea that the whole country is up for sale,"" CPI general secretary A B Bardhan said.

The Left''s anti-disinvestment rhetoric had on Friday played havoc on the stock markets with all major scrips, particularly that of the PSUs, tumbling.

The veteran CPI leader was particularly against the sale of blue chip PSUs like ONGC, IOC, HPCL, BPCL and Nalco. ""We are for selective disinvestment of bankrupt and sick public sector units. It can be done by the Finance Ministry,"" he said.

Blaming the ''anti-people and anti-farmer policies'' of the Vajpayee government for the rout of BJP at the hustings, Bardhan said globalisation and liberalisation policies had hurt the farming community.

India has removed quantitative restrictions without ensuring that its farmers get the same access in the developed countries. ""US still continues to protect its farmers and we have opened up by removing all restrictions on foreign imports,"" he said.

CPI was for foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in high-technology industry, but disfavoured a ""sell off"" to the foreign investor.

17,Cong to pursue reform policy: Manmohan,"NEW DELHI: Setting at rest any rollback of disinvestment of cash-rich oil companies in the wake of blue chip oil firms taking a beating in the stock market, Congress on Saturday said it will pursue the reform policy but was against their privatisation as they were ""strategic companies"".

""Disinvestment, yes. Privatisation, we will have to think. You will have to make a distinction between disinvestment and privatisation,"" senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh, who is tipped to become finance minister, said after the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting which elected Sonia Gandhi as its leader.

Even BJP was against privatisation of ONGC, Singh said adding disinvestment upto 51 per cent of government equity in oil companies was a possibility.

The oil industry was ""strategic"". The oil companies were also profit-making companies. If they can perform and compete against private oil companies, he wondered why should they be privatised.

""We are not for privatisation as an ideology,"" he said indicating Congress would not be averse to pursuing this reform measure where privatisation and disinvestment were in the interest of the country, helped raise resources and provided more elbow room to public sector undertakings.

Asked what would be the economic agenda of the new Congress-led coalition government, Singh said ""we will have to move further on road to peace, prosperity and economic growth.""

""We can''t be still and static and provide all answers. We have to progress all around. We have to ensure whatever reforms we contemplate, they do address the concerns of the people, our parties and our workers, concerns of social safety net"", he said implying that his government would pursue reforms with a human face.

Singh also said he would lay emphasis on addressing the concerns of social sector and infrastructure development.

To a question if economic reforms pursued by the NDA would be continued, Singh said ""Life is not static. If there are aberrations, they needed to be corrected.""

Asked if there would be any dilution in Congress'' reforms agenda in the face of the alliance with Left parties, Singh said the Common Minimum Programme was being worked out and it would take a few days to complete it.

Singh is heading the committee which is entrusted with the task of preparing the Common Minimum Programme. It also includes senior Congress leader Pranab Mukharjee and Jairam Ramesh.

Regarding interest rates, which have fallen by 200 basis points in the last couple of years, Singh said this was an issue which was in the domain of Reserve Bank of India.

18,Shourie is topmost economic terrorist: Amar Singh,"NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh on Friday lambasted former NDA minister for disinvestment Arun Shourie as ""one of the topmost economic terrorists we have ever seen. He was terrorising the corporate tycoons and the share market players for his disinvestment programmes"". SP was thoroughly against his madness about disinvestment, Singh added.

Asked why he mentioned Shourie with such disdain, Singh replied, ""He (Shourie) was calling everybody (corporate tycoons) and gagging (sic) them for doing this so that his disinvestment programmes go well.""

When asked by a TV channel what if corporate sector thought about disposing off certain PSUs, a couple of which even his friend Anil Ambani bought, Singh replied, ""What Anil Ambani as a corporate tycoon did must be adhering to their corporate policy and definitely for doing whatever was good for their business. I am not saying anything about that. But definitely I am blaming the government of India for selling the family jewels for no reasons.""

To another question Singh said, ""We are not against disinvestment. But selling the family jewels has no justification. I am telling about disposing off the family jewels which means selling the companies which are making profits.""

Referring to Tata''s buying of the VSNL, Singh said, ""More money than the amount Tatas paid for buying the VSNL, was already in the VSNL''s bank account. They (Tatas) took the money out and invested in other businesses.""

Asked about SP''s economic programmes, Singh said, ""Samajwadi Party''s economic policies are all close to the Leftists, and whatever the Left would want us to do, Mulayam Singhji would take decisions accordingly. Our views are almost the same what the Left parties think.""

19,Cong MP from Kangra eyes ministerial berth,"DHARAMSALA: With all set for the constitution of the Congress-led government at the Centre, the newly elected MP from Kangra Parliamentary constituency, Chander Kumar of Congress and state forest minister in Himachal Pradesh has started making moves and lobbying to find a ministerial berth.

Though it remains to be seen that Chander Kumar, who had left for New Delhi to lobby for a ministerial berth would succeed in his bid or not. However, notwithstanding the possible induction of Chander Kumar in the Central council of ministers, he was being regarded as one of the strong candidates from Himachal Pradesh to get the nod. Chander Kumar, who had been in the state politics for about two decades, had held the post of Cabinet minister twice in the state council of ministers.

The Himachal Pradesh which had been earlier represented by Shanta Kumar, former Union Rural Development minister would be hoping that one of the MPs from the state may find birth in the Union Council of Ministers. Shanta Kumarâ€™s unceremonious exit from the Union Council of Ministers in April 2003 was also one of the significant factors for his defeat in the Lok Sabha elections.

However, Chander Kumar''s task might not be easy in his bid to get a ministerial berth in the Union Council of Ministers due to lobbying by Anand Sharma, the national spokesman of All India Congress and Rajya Sabha member was also reported to be in the race.

Anand Sharma seems to have the edge due to his close proximity with the 10 Janpath and due to this, he could get the nod in the Union Council of Ministers. But there was also feeling with in some circles of Congress that Anand Sharma may not be given a ministerial assignment to use his experience in strengthening the party and in that case Chander Kumar could find a ministerial berth.

Besides this, Chander Kumar, who belongs to other backwards classes (OBC) community, could go through in case the party decides to give representation to OBC community from Himachal Pradesh. Another major factor in favour of Chadne Kumar was that he would make his maiden entry into the Parliament defeating Shanta Kumar, the first Union Cabinet minister from HP.

20,CPM dilutes stand on disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: Diluting the stand it had taken on divestment, CPM on Saturday said that partial disinvestment ""could be discussed"", but it was opposed to privatisation of profit making units.

Briefing reporters after CPM politburo meeting, party spokesman Sitaram Yechuri said ""we are against nationalisation of losses and privatisation of profits"".

He also sought a probe on stock market crash and the ""bear cartel"" referred to by outgoing Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie during the public offering in six companies, including ONGC and GAIL.

Asked if the party was open for partial disinvestment even while opposing privatisation of profit making PSUs, he said ""we are open to it.""

Yechuri had on Friday demanded scrapping of the disinvestment ministry while opposing divestment in Navratna and profit making PSUs, leading to a crash in the stock markets.

Asserting that his party was opposed to privatisation of Navratna and mid-size profit making PSUs, he said effort should be made to revive the third category of loss making and potentially loss making units by bringing in private investment through joint ventures.

""If all other options fail than a decision should be taken to dispose them after consultation between government, workers and management,"" he added.

On whether the probe should be by market regulator Sebi, CBI or Joint Parliamentary Committee, he said ""we are open to it... let the new government decide on it.""

Dismissing criticism that party leaders'' statements had led to a ""blood bath"" in stock markets, specially capital outflow, Yechuri said whole issue had to be looked into. ""Why is it happening after the elections and who is behind it.""

Echoing the demand of probe into the stock market crash, senior party leader, Neelotpal Basu said ""the market has been pulled down by manipulators to undermine our position during discussions on the Common Minimum Programme.""

Yechuri said that it would be naive to ascribe the stock market crash to some statements made by CPM leaders.

""Globally the oil price is going up, dollar is firming and international capital market is volatile. India cannot be insulated. India cannot be away from it,"" he said.

However, reiterating the stand taken by CPM leaders on scrapping of disinvestment ministry, he said that the job of disposing of loss making PSUs that could not be revived could be taken up by other ministries and departments.

On the issue of foreign investment, Yechuri said ""in the era of globalisation the country cannot remain insulated."" But any foreign investment coming into the country should fulfill three conditions, he said.

""It should augment productive capacity instead of asset acquisition, it should lead to technology upgradation of the economy and should generate employment,"" he added.

21,Two arrested for cheating company of Rs 2.2 cr,"NEW DELHI: Two persons were arrested for allegedly cheating a finance company of Rs 2.20 crore, eight years ago. The accused, S K Sharma (52) and P V Acharya (46) worked with Maharashtra Glass and Agro Limited (MGAL).

Sharma and Acharya worked as chartered accountant and finance controller for MGAL before the company''s takeover by a new French firm.

A senior police officer said: ""They cheated the firm before the takeover. The two furnished fake documents to seek finance of non-existent machinery.""

The police are still on a lookout for the directors of MGAL who were also a part of the alleged conspiracy.

The company complained to the EOW last year. They alleged that Sharma and Acharya had approached them for the finance of furnace machinery which is used for manufacturing glass.

On MGAL''s request, the French firm sanctioned a loan of Rs 2.20 crore. Later, when the complainant did not receive the payment, they found that the machinery for which the accused availed the loan was never purchased.

""Also a Pune-based address given to Wipro Finance Limited for future communication did not exist,"" the officer said.

The engineer who gave an inspection report to the finance company was employed with MGAL. ""He, therefore, gave a report supporting MGAL''s claim,"" he said.

Accused Sharma also got an insurance certificate from United India Insurance. This certificate was for the non-existent machinery and was one of the primary reasons for the sanction of loan.

""But even this certificate was obtained on the basis of forged documents,"" the officer added.
