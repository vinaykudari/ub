1,Bipolar political equations intact,"AHMEDABAD: In this two-horse race for the 26 constituencies in Gujarat, hardly anybody could make a dent. Those who tried drew a blank but perhaps had the satisfaction of having tried to alter the bipolar politics of Gujarat.

The Bahujan Samaj Party''s performance was nothing much to write home about but left a mark here and there. Of the 12 small parties that contested in Gujarat, the BSP which fielded its candidates in 20 constituencies has fared the best having polled 2,25, 637 votes or 1.48 per cent of the total votes polled. This shows sizeable gains for a party that had got just 9,752 votes in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections.

In fact, the BSP along with other small parties like Silvassa MP Mohan Delkar''s Bharatiya Navshakti Party (BNP) is being seen as having damaged prospects of the Congress candidates more than the BJP.

In Porbandar, BJP''s Hira Patel posted victory over veteran Vitthal Radadiya by 5,703 votes. What''s noteworthy here is that BSP candidate Bhutiya Aebhabhai got 7, 300 votes, which is a 1,600-odd votes more than the winning margin.

In Vadodara, BSP candidate Kalodia Surendrasinh won 8,766 votes which is around 2,000 more than the margin of 6, 603 by which BJP''s Jaya Thakkar defeated Congress candidate Satyajit Gaekwad! In Mehsana, BSP''s Punjaji Thakore got 10,222 votes.

Here, Congress candidate Jivabhai Patel defeated BJP''s Nitin Patel by 14, 511 votes.

In Patan, Mahesh Kanodia won by 23,624 votes over Congress candidate Pravin Rashtrapal. The BSP candidate Karbatiya Lallubhai got 13,841 votes.

In Dahod, the BNP proved killjoy for Congress''s Prabha Taviyad who lost to BJP''s Babu Katara by just 361 votes! The BNP candidate, Congress rebel Somji Damor, polled a whopping 45,000 votes, a big chunk of which would have gone to Dr Taviyad and help her easily post a maiden victory.

Damor had quit Congress protesting Dr Taviyad''s candidature and now even senior Congress leaders admit that the BNP did play a role in finishing off Congress''s chances in this reserved seat. ""Dr Taviyad was a good candidate who is capable, educated and politically savvy.

Damor did affect the result,'' conceded senior Congress leader Urmila Patel. It needs mention that the BNP has polled 1, 36, 415 votes in this Lok Sabha elections. In the assembly elections 2002, the party had got 2,34,166 votes.

Satyajit Gaekwad, however, refuses to acknowledge that the BSP intruded in the Congress vote bank in his constituency. ""The BSP has polled more votes than the votes by which I have lost to the BJP, alright. But our analysis indicates that there is no shift of the voters from the Congress to the BSP,'' he said.

The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) that got 1,76,634 votes, all in Rajkot which was foresaken by the Congress in its favour, has upped its tally from 1999 Lok Sabha elections where it had got 71,015 votes.

In the assembly elections 2002, the party had got 3, 49, 021 votes. Of other small parties that managed to make a difference was SP in Amreli. Here, Congress candidate Virji Thumar defeated BJP''s Dilip Sanghani by 2,030 votes while SP candidate Dahyabhai Solanki got 9, 583 votes.

In Bharuch, Chhotu Vasava of the JD(U) got 1,11,600 votes while BJP''s Mansukh Vasava''s margin over Congress''s Mohammad Patel was 72,202 votes. Vasava has been contesting the last four parliamentary elections and each time he managed around one lakh votes which helps the BJP in the ultimate analysis.

2,Decision on joining govt by today?,"NEW DELHI: As they debate the pros and cons of joining the Congress-led coalition, Left leaders have made it clear that the 1996 and 2004 situations are different.

When the United Front government was formed in 1996, the CPM had been offered the post of Prime Minister. But in 2004, the offer is only to join a coalition government.

The CPI''s national executive is meeting to debate on joining the government and a final decision is expected by Sunday.

However, it remains to be seen whether the CPI announces its decision before the CPM does, because both want to take a collective decision.

3,Cops' fingers crossed after political drama,"BANGALORE: The great political churning happening in the state has given rise to a sense of discomfort in the police force too.

Shake-up in the force''s hierarchy being the norm with each change in the political dispensation, policemen are pulling their personal, political and professional strings to place themselves in lucrative posts, or to at least find out what their fate would be.

Their immediate concern is the choice of home minister as the police force comes directly under the ministry. Then, the chief minister.

""Some of my colleagues are extra smart. They had identified the winning horses and backed them during the elections,â€� a senior police officer said.

All that policemen are discussing now is which officer is close to which political head and who would likely adorn important posts in the force. They even have equations running in their heads as to the possible choices if certain leaders came to assume important political posts. As there will be favourites, there will also be those who will be at the wrong end of the stick, purely because of their political proximities. Punishment transfers, elevation of certain officers and new postings to some, will all be part of the game.

It is common that whenever a new government comes into existence, the chief minister hand picks the intelligence chief and a select team. For, it is the intelligence wing that keeps the CM updated on the happenings, political or otherwise, across the state.

In the past, new governments have known to change police commissioners of Bangalore and other cities along with superintendents of police in districts.

The new government will also have to take a decision on the state police chief as T. Madiyal is retiring on June 30.

May-June also being the transfer season, police officers bracing themselves for a big transfer list this time.

But it will not be as bad as it is in the neighbouing Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, where bureaucracy is reshuffled completely. In Karnataka, however, such large-scale transfers have rarely occurred, the officer pointed out.

So, the waiting game is on for the policemen.

4,"Gowda, Sonia discuss govt formation","NEW DELHI: The issue of the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) forming the next government in Karnataka was decided ""in principle"" when JDS chief and former PM H D Deve Gowda had an hour-long meeting with PM-designate Sonia Gandhi.

However, Deve Gowda maintained that ""details"" - like who would head that government - had not been discussed. Another round of talks with Gandhi were needed. He would take the party MLAs into confidence at their meeting scheduled in Bangalore on Sunday.

""In principle, we have decided to keep the BJP out. But it will have to be a collective decision,"" he said.

The Gandhi-Gowda meeting sealed the alliance and should prove a disappointment to BJP which has for long wanted to make Karnataka its gateway to South.

5,Tough task for NDA in assembly polls,"PATNA: If the performance of NDA in the recently-held Lok Sabha elections in Bihar is anything to go by, capturing power in the state in assembly polls due next year will prove to be an uphill task for it.

BJP and Janata Dal (United), two constituents of NDA in Bihar, could take lead in only about 76 out of the 225 assembly segments falling under 37 parliamentary constituencies, results of which were declared on May 13. The RJD-led alliance comprising RJD, Lok Janshakti Party, Congress party and the CPM, on the other hand, led in 149 assembly segments.

With the results of Siwan, Bettiah and Chhapra parliamentary constituencies yet to come, lead position of RJD alliance is expected to cross 155 mark.

There are 243 assembly seats in Bihar. Although senior NDA leaders are putting up a brave face, yet results of 37 constituencies has clearly pushed panic buttons in NDA camp and both its constituents are busy analysing reasons behind their extremely poor show in LS polls.

NDA had claimed that it would win at least 30 out of 40 Lok Sabha seats of Bihar.

It could, however, win only 11 seats with BJP winning five and JD(U) six. BJP has convened the meeting of its state working committee on May 16 to discuss poll results.

It has also convened a meeting of state office-bearers and legislators on Saturday to take stock of political situation in the wake of poll results.

State BJP general secretary, organisation, Harendra Pratap, who had direct links with RSS headquarters, said that party had convened working committee meeting to begin preparations for assembly polls as well as the next Lok Sabha polls likely to be held within one year due to ideological differences between Congress and Left Front.

He said that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would contest at least 50 per cent of total assembly seats in Bihar in assembly polls.

A top BJP leader on May 14 said that poor show of NDA had not come as a surprise to RSS headquarters and BJP central leadership as Pratap had informed them after completion of third and last phase phase of polls in Bihar on May 5 itself that the National Democratic Alliance would win only 13 seats (BJP-6 and JD(U)-seven) in Bihar.

But, senior Congress leader and former Speaker of state assembly Radhanandan Jha said that results of LS polls had made it abundantly clear that people had expressed their abiding faith in the leadership of RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.

Analysing the reasons for pathetic performance of NDA in Bihar, Pratap had maintained that refusal of JD(U) to leave Muzaffarpur seat for former Union minister Captain Jai Narain Nishad, who had joined BJP just before polls, and the shabby treatment given to another extremely backward caste (EBC) leader Brahmanand Mandal which forced him to stay put in Samata Party instead of joining JD(U) despite its merger into it, had cost EBC votes to NDA.

This is evident from the fact that JD(U) national president George Fernandes could win by a small margin of less than 10,000 votes from Muzaffarpur. Nishad had won Muzaffarpur seat in 1999.

Pratap had also maintained that statement of Fernandes that Centre would impose Presidentâ€™s rule in Bihar if NDA returned to power did not go down well with Yadavs and Muslims (M-Y) and helped Laloo consoldidate his M-Y vote bank.

6,It's 'party' time for losing saffron heavyweights,"MUMBAI: When the high and mighty fall, they take a while to pick themselves up again. Mumbai''s heavyweights, who were humbled at the hustings by novices and nobodies, are still dazed by the shock of their tumble.

They are just beginning to askâ€”after high office in New Delhi, what? The saffron stalwarts have pat answers. Build up the support base once again, strengthen the party for the assembly elections, pass on hard-won political wisdom to the younger generation.

Five-time MP Ram Naik is already being sought after by the BJP''s school, the Rambhau Mhalgi Prabhodini, to train up- and-coming party workers. Fellow party member Jaywantiben Mehta also talks of helping train BJP cadres.

""I plan to teach at Keshav Shrusti, our training centre at Uttan. Besides, my work in my constituency will continue,"" she says.

And, chastened by his defeat at the hands of the David-like Eknath Gaikwad, outgoing Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi says he will work to strengthen the Shiv Sena''s base for the coming assembly polls.

""In the last five years I was unable to do much for the party, but now I will concentrate on party work,"" Joshi told TNN.

But it''s a grim prospect for old warhorses like Naik, who will be 75 by the time of the next polls (if the Congress government lasts the full term), and will be facing an electorate which seems to be swinging towards younger representatives.

Mehta is now 66 and Joshi is 67, facing one of the biggest setbacks in a political career which has been largely on the up and up.

Both Naik, who is still stunned by the results, and Joshi will be doing some introspection and analysis in the next few months, especially as there was reportedly some friction and disgruntlement among party workers this time.

Still, bouncing back in spirit if not in votes may be just a matter of time. Mehta says the shock and hurt of her defeat dissipated when former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee called her up late on Thursday night to cheer her.

""He reminded me that there were a lot of unfinished tasks ahead of us, and that he was already moving out of the PM''s house,"" she said. The next day, the Bhuleshwar ki Bhavani began preparing for her visit to Delhi to wind up her office and attend meetings.

Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, director-general of Rambhau Mhalgi centre and convenor of the All India Training Cell of the BJP, says he approached Naik because he is a model for young politicians.

""Since its inception, Naik has been part ofthe senior visiting faculty at the centre, holding workshops on legislative performance, on nurturing consitutencies, on how elected representatives can excel at their work,"" he said, adding, ""He has been a great source of support and we are happy that he will be able to devote more time to the mission.""

Then, of course, there''s all that reading to catch up on. Mehta reads a lot of party literature, but now she will have enough time for her favourite Marathi novels.

7,Cong inclined to join JD(S) in Karnataka,"BANGALORE: A crucial meeting of JD(S) is being held on Sunday to decide on formation of a new Government in Karnataka in the wake of a fluid political situation following a hung assembly thrown up by the just concluded polls.

Former Prime Minister and JD(S) President H D Deve Gowda who met Congress President and Parliamentary leader Sonia Gandhi and other senior leaders on Saturday and discussed the political scene in the state, would attend the meeting of the newly elected MLAs and MPs.

Even as the BJP, which has emerged as the single largest party in a fractured verdict, is helplessly watching the unfolding drama, JD(S) has left no one in doubt that it was not inclined for a coalition with the saffron party.

Taking the initiative, the Congress, which was battered in the elections, sent the first clear message to JD(S) on partnering with it in providing the new dispensation.

With both JD(S) and Congress now showing their inclination to join hands, the post of the Chief Minister still remains the bone of contention.

BJP with 79 members in the newly elected house has to reach the magic figure of 113 to be able to form the Government and it could happen only with the support of JD(S) which has made it clear where its sympathies lie.

Congress has won 65 seats and JD(S) 58, giving the latter the role of the kingmaker.

8,BJP to meet to take stock of developments,"NEW DELHI: Top BJP leaders are meeting on Monday to take stock of the political developments and the reported threat of party senior Sushma Swaraj to resign her Rajya Sabha membership alongwith her husband Swaraj Kaushal if Sonia Gandhi becomes Prime Minister.

The meeting to be attended by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh and Swaraj at the residence of party President M Venkaiah Naidu is likely to discuss Swaraj''s move, party sources said.

It is also likely to discuss former party idelogue K N Govindacharya''s proposed move to launch a National Self-Respect Movement and his appeal to all political parties and individuals to protest against Sonia being made the Prime Minister, the sources said.

The meeting is likely to have a preliminary discussion on the constitution of the National Executive and appointment of office bearers which had been kept in abeyance by the party president in view of the Lok Sabha elections, the sources said.

Though a final decision on the appointment of members of the National Executive is at the discretion of the party president but in view of the party now becoming the opposition party in the Lok Sabha and several prominent leaders losing at the hustings, Naidu is likely to consult other leaders before constituting the Executive, the sources said.

11,Left unlikely to join Cong-led govt,"NEW DELHI: Left parties on Sunday deferred a decision on their participation in the new Congress-led government at the Centre till Monday amid strong indications that the parties would not join it but only extend support from outside.

CPM, CPI and two other Left parties RSP and Forward Bloc have reportedly already given their letter of support to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

The four Communist parties would hold a joint meeting here on Monday to finalise their stand on participation as well as the Common Minimum Programme.

The parties individually held their meetings throughout the day on Sunday but failed to arrive at a consensus on the issue of participation in the government with an overwhelming opinion against joining.

This follows significant differences in the economic policies of the Left and the leader of the coalition - Congress - that could prove detrimental to the Left parties in case they joined the government, sources said.
