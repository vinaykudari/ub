0,Good govts don't grope in the dark,"bangalore: welcome to bangalore: a silicon valley that relies on the rain gods to provide its people with basic electricity and water. among bangalore''s many distinctions, this one has to be the most indisputable: a global it hub that turns barren and black if the rains do not arrive on time. there can be no city of comparable pretensions that depends on nature so heavily for its basic needs as india''s it capital. should not be such a difficult reality to live with except for the fact that in the middle of a particularly cruel summer, the state''s powerful have nothing to offer except a helpless finger at the blue skies as an explanation for their abysmal failure. good governments don''t grope in the dark in a crisis. they act decisively and look for solutions instead of blaming each other and throwing their hands up in despair. the dichotomy is shattering: here is a city at the cusp of technology leadership, surviving at the mercy of nature and the magnanimity of its neighbours to provide its people with basic electricity. let us never forget that our state is in the charge of a man, who by common media consensus is the country''s best chief minister. even as the city smoulders and sweats through the summer, the government seeks shelter in strange excuses, defending something even as preposterous as unscheduled power cuts as a smart move. save water heaters, which people might switch on ahead of scheduled power cuts in morning rush hours, the fact is that unscheduled load shedding can in no other way facilitate better power management. unless of course (kptc chairman) baligar argues that once forewarned about blackouts consumers will somehow contrive to make their lights, fans, refrigerators and air conditioners work at twice their rated speeds, during the normal hours. this is illogical if not downright absurd. clearly if this is governance, then most of us will be glad to have none at all if only we could afford it. not all of us can, of course, buy standby power systems or install our own borewells, but the spurt in their sales this summer is an indication of how much faith people have in the effectiveness of the government. if we have to rely on our own vehicles, generators and bore wells for transport, power and water, then do we need a government at all? companies in bangalore now have their own captive power units, the more affluent sections are hooked to inverters and bore wells; these people desire to have as little to do with their government as they possibly can. the political custodians of our state have often enough referred to bangalore as a singapore in the making, forgetting each time to add two other words without which the description is incomplete: bangalore is a parody of singapore in the making.

1,DMs ignore minister’s call on meet,"kolkata: six district magistrates blatantly ignored the state pwd minister amar choudhuryâ€™s instructions to attend a meeting on tuesday which was to finalise construction of the adb-funded rs 1,500 crore north-south corridor in west bengal. the minister, who was not even informed that the dms would not be able to attend the meeting, has decided to bring the matter to the notice of the chief minister. an exasperated choudhury told reporters that perhaps the dms thought it prudent to ignore his instructions and chose to abide by the chief secretaryâ€™s order not to leave station in view of the volatile communal situation in the country. choudhury said that as early as on march 29, the dms as well as the sabhadhipatis of north 24 parganas, nadia, murshidabad, malda, south dinajpur and north dinajpur had been informed of the meeting. the chief secretaryâ€™s order was sent on april 9, he said. the dms did not even care to send their representatives, the minister informed. the pwd minister, however, went ahead with the meeting with officers of his own department and decided to issue identity cards within june 30 to all residents of the six districts who would have to be evicted for the construction of the north-south corridor. compensation would be paid to all of them within october 15. a resettlement advisory committee and a grievance redress committee would be formed before the construction of the road began, he said.

2,MCD to buy 200 covered trucks,"new delhi: if officials of the municipal corporation of delhi (mcd) are to be believed, garbage trucks spilling filth all over the city will soon be a thing of the past. senior officials said the mcd was planning to purchase 200 covered trucks from tatas to carry garbage. â€˜â€˜we may purchase upto 300 trucks, depending on the corporationâ€™s financial status,â€™â€™ said ravi dass, director of the conservancy and sanitation engineering (cse) wing. mcd officials said the decision to have covered trucks became mandatory after the supreme courtâ€™s ruling on municipal solid waste management in 2000. the apex court direction clearly said that â€˜â€˜all garbage trucks must be covered so that they did not emit any foul smell and litter the city with garbage.â€™â€™ adhering to that direction, the mcd would buy covered trucks from the tatas. these trucks would meet euro-ii emission norms and each vehicle would cost about rs 8.4 lakh. additional commissioner ramesh negi said: â€˜â€˜we have another proposal for signing a contract with the tatas for maintaining the trucks. the corporation is not keen to hand over these trucks to its own auto workshop staff. we want to downsize the staff in the workshops.â€™â€™

3,New police unit to handle riots,"new delhi: the delhi police plans to raise a battalion of anti-riot force to handle mobs. at a later stage, five-member teams of these specially trained and equipped personnel would be posted at each police station. after two years of groundwork, the first batch of two companies (200 personnel) of the riot control unit was recently deployed by the police. the personnel of the anti-riot unit who underwent a three-month rigorous training under the supervision of rapid action force (raf) officials at kingsway camp, have been armed with special ammunition. the personnel, drawn from the 10 companies of cp reserve force, have been given a distinct grey uniform and are stationed at the vijay ghat grounds. â€˜â€˜each of the 200 trained members of the unit has been handpicked,â€™â€™ said dcp, ist battalion , manoj kumar lall. the men have also been given lessons in human rights. dcp, provisioning and lines, kewal singh, said: â€˜â€˜over 1,000 pump action guns of 12 bore have been procured for the unit.â€™â€™ the guns offer the freedom of using a variety of ammunition including rubber bullets, he said. a senior police official said raf superiors have trained a number of delhi police personnel for being instructors. â€˜â€˜these trainers are likely to extend the rigorous training to personnel who would comprise the proposed riot control battalion,â€™â€™ he said. the recruits of the special unit had also participated in the delhi police day parade in february. till the constitution of the unit, the police had to rely on the raf for tackling serious mob situations. â€˜â€˜the availability of our own anti-riot unit would reduce reaction time in controlling violent situations,â€™â€™ said an official.

4,"‘Godhra, riot culprits are the same’","lucknow: the bharatiya janata party state president kalraj mishra said here on tuesday that the inhuman and well-organised brutal murder of men, women and children in godhra, who were burnt alive in the sabarmati express, was highly deplorable. terming the violence which erupted in gujarat later was only a sequel to the godhra incident, he accused the same powers of fanning violence in gujarat who were responsible for the godhra incident. while condemning both the godhra incident and the following violence in gujarat, mishra lamented that instead of trying to help in establishing peace, the congress and other parties were trying to aggravate the situation there by politicising the whole issue. the state bjp chief was addressing the bharatiya janata yuva morcha (bjym) activists who had organised a sit-in at patel park here on tuesday. speaking on the occasion, bjym national president shiva raj singh chauhan accused the congress of instigating the communal violence in gujarat.

5,639 PPSC selections scrapped,"chandigarh: the punjab government has decided to reject the recommendations of punjab public service commission (ppsc) for 639 posts related to different departments, for which the government was yet to issue notification. also, the government has decided to review all the 3,446 appointments made on the recommendations of the commission during the chairmanship of ravinder pal singh sidhu, who is currently facing charges of corruption. however, chief minister amarinder singh said all selections could not have been effected for bribe because in that case the total assets of sidhu would have been in the vicinity of rs 3,000 crore. amarinder also released the list of sidhuâ€™s assets worth rs 25 crore, discovered so far, and also named his seven accomplices who are absconding. the cm said those who had paid bribes to secure coveted jobs in the punjab government too were guilty and would not be spared. when pointed out that some influential persons, including persons holding judicial positions, had got their wards recruited by paying bribes, amarinder assured that none would be spared. practically giving a clean chit to the other members of the commission, amarinder singh said his information was that they were not involved in the appointments. however, he assured that their conduct too would be probed. amarinder singh also gave a clean chit to former chief minister harcharan singh brar of the congress, who had appointed sidhu ppsc chairman. â€˜â€˜it is not my fault if any of my appointees indulges in corruption,â€™â€™ he added. however, he did not spare his immediate predecessor parkash singh badal. he said badal must have been aware of what was going on in the commission but he turned a blind eye to it. when asked if badal and sidhu were in cahoots, amarinder skirted the issue saying those involved would be brought to book. responding to a question on the current status of sidhu,amarinder singh said the government would soon send it to the governor, to be forwarded to the president, who in turn would refer it to the supreme court. however, he said, the government proposed appointing an acting chairman after sidhuâ€™s suspension.

6,Sidhu’s associate arrested,"chandigarh: panjab university senator paramjit singh pammi, who was one of the four key accomplices in the clandestine operations of ppsc chairman ravinder pal singh sidhu, was arrested here, on tuesday. the vigilance had procured his arrest warrants last month soon after sidhu was taken into custody. the other three persons for whom the vigilance has been on the look-out include moga-based prem sagar, shamsher singh of zirakpur and randhir singh gill of ludhiana. with the arrest of pammi, the vigilance has taken four persons including sidhu into custody in connection with the bribe scam. earlier, sidhuâ€™s friend, jagman singh, and surinder kaur, wife of g s manchanda, were arrested. while jagman handled the bribe money and arranged examination papers in chandigarh, surinder is accused of transacting rs 1 crore of sidhuâ€™s money through hawala channel to the us. lockers found empty: the vigilance officials were in for a surprise as both the bank lockers that were broke open on tuesday in connection with the sidhu bribery scam were found to be empty. it was for the second time that the vigilance drew a blank. last time, a locker owned by sidhuâ€™s key associate, jagman singh, in the indusind bank here, was found to be empty. the lockers which were opened on tuesday belonged to sidhuâ€™s brother, ritender singh and his mother, pritpal kaur. finding all the last three lockers empty after having recovered nearly rs 1.63 crore each from the five lockers early last week, has surprised the vigilance officials. they said the opening of lockers was a gamble as they might have been purchased to store the money which was expected to come sidhuâ€™s way in the near future.

8,Court rules out conspiracy in Gulshan case,"mumbai: the sessions court on tuesday rejected the conspiracy charge levelled by the prosecution against 18 accused facing trial in the gulshan kumar murder case. judge m.l. tahaliyani said the prosecution had failed to prove the conspiracy charge. the police had claimed that the plot to kill the audio-cassette magnate was hatched in dubai between january and august 1997 and that underworld don abu salem had paid contract money of rs 25 lakhs to the killers in mumbai. the much-awaited verdict of the murder trial, which began four years after gulshan kumar was shot outside a temple in juhu on august 12, 1997, will be delivered on wednesday. the 18 persons on trial include ramesh taurani, director of tips cassettes, and sharpshooters rashid dawood merchant and rauf dawood merchant. while dictating the judgment in open court on tuesday, the judge also said that the evidence of arif lakdawala, a prosecution witness who said taurani had paid rs 25 lakhs for killing gulshan kumar, had to be discarded since his role was more that of an accomplice. the police case was that lakdawala had paid rs 25 lakhs to nadeem to be given to dubai-based gangster abu salem for executing the murder, which was the outcome of alleged business rivalry.

9,Varsity may modify formula for foreign tie-ups,"mumbai: mumbai universityâ€™s mission abroad may yet be salvaged. while its much-touted plans offer courses at educational institutions abroad have been grounded for the last year, the university has now worked out a formula to secure the university grants commissionâ€™s (ugc) all-important approval for the proposals. the ugc, the apex body governing higher education in the country, had earlier objected to the franchisee nature of the universityâ€™s proposed tie-ups with institutes in dubai and muscat. the commission was ready to approve only collaborations in which the university would have a greater voice in academic and administrative activities. at a meeting of the management council held last week, the university decided to incorporate more regulatory clauses in its agreements with institutions abroad. â€œwe have made changes according to the ugcâ€™s recommendations, and these will be forwarded to the commission for approval,â€™â€™ a university official told this newspaper. the university is planning to tie up with the indian academy for higher education in muscat, beams international education institute and institutions run by the varkey group in dubai. these institutes will offer university courses, and pay mumbai university substantial affiliation fees and other charges. the ugc agreed to reconsider its disapproval of the projects if â€œan inbuilt regulatory procedureâ€™â€™ was incorporated in the agreements between the university and the institutes. the university has now decided to include clauses in its memorandum of understanding with the muscat institute saying that the academic programmes would be conducted and monitored as per the rules set down by its academic council. the university will also appoint a full-time director to oversee academic and administrative matters of the institute. â€œthe salary, monetary perks and other facilities will be paid and provided for by the university, which will be reimbursed by the indian academy,â€™â€™ the clause says. the additions may find favour with the ugc now that the central government has said that it would encourage universities to open up campuses outside india. â€œit is also part of the tenth plan,â€™â€™ arun nigavekar, officiating chairperson of the commission, said. nevertheless, there could be no compromise on quality while exporting higher education, he said. he added that indian universities should have full control over the foreign instituteâ€™s affairs. â€œthe institute should more or less function as a satellite campus of the university,â€™â€™ mr nigavekar said.the ugc would support universities in its foreign initiatives, but they would have to first convince the commission that it not be a franchisee operation. â€œafter all, it affects not just credibility of the university, that of the nation as a whole.â€™â€™ the ugc would decide viability of the mumbai university proposal when it came up the commission, mr nigavekar said. university officials, meanwhile, claim to have cleared yet roadblock in their gulf pursuits. there were concerns that maharashtra universitiesâ€™ 1994, may have to be amended the university were to offer courses abroad, as the act says universityâ€™s territorial jurisdiction does not extend beyond the the government, however, recently clarified that academic collaborations with foreign educational institutes did not require such amendment.while some academics are still concerned whether the universityâ€™s proposed tie-ups can be called collaborations, university officials seem to be to go ahead on that premise.

10,All-party panel on rehabilitation fails,"gandhinagar: the meeting of the all-party committee, formed to look after the 100-odd relief camps, failed to reach an agreement here on monady on rehabilitating the 1.9 lakh displaced people. the meeting ended after one-and-a-half hours of deliberations that led to heated exchanges between government representatives led by chief minister narendra modi and opposition leaders led by congress legislature party chief naresh raval. at one point, the governor''s adc d g vanzara, looking after bhandari''s security, intervened, only to be told by raval to ""keep a distance."" raj bhawan sources said the issue cropped up after raval raised the matter concerning insecurity among villages. citing the instance of the attack on dalit congressman someshwar pandya in sardarpura village in mehsana district, where 29 muslims were charred to death on march 1, raval said, ""pandya, badly injured, filed an fir naming sangh parivar persons who had attacked him. the fir was torn apart, no arrests are being made. the harijans of sardarpura live in constant threat, none cares. what confidence building measures can you expect?"" raval and other congress leaders amarsinh chaudhary and siddharth patel, wanted to know what the government had done for rehabilitation, only to be told by the cm that ""the work on the rehabilitation front can start only when peace returns in towns and villages. if people return home right now, who will be responsible if they are killed?"" this was a complete somersault from the earlier thinking of the cm at the recent cabinet meeting where relief camps were called the centres from where all troubles ensued. the opposition leaders wanted that the death and housing compensation be paid forthwith. amarsinh particularly said he was ""distressed"" that often only one-fifth of the rs 50,000 housing compensation was being paid though the house was totally razed. raval stressed, giving the instance of od village in kheda district, that the death compensation was not being paid only because the bodies could not be identified. ""a district-level committee has been formed to decide on the basis of circumstantial evidence. why can''t that be activated?"" he asked. there was, however, no talk about the ""missing"" persons. the only decision taken by the committee, confirmed officials around bhandari, related to all its members going together to different relief camps to find out what the riot victims had to say. the cm has so far gone to not more than a couple of small muslim camps where he felt ""safe."" when contacted, raval agreed that there were ""some strong words spoken,"" and added, ""the way in which the meeting was conducted made it clear that the ruling bjp was not interested in serious discussion. health minister ashok bhatt tried to compare 1985 riots, while the cm snubbed independent mla usmaghani devdivala who raised the issue of examinations.""

11,Munde demands white paper on riots,"mumbai: senior bjp leader g o p i n a t h munde on tuesday demanded a white paper on the 51 communal riots which, he alleged, had occured in maharashtra during the congress-led democratic front governmentâ€™s 30-month reign. claiming that the congress was formenting communal unrest around india in a bid to destabilise the bjp-led nda government at the centre, mr munde told the maharashtra legislative assembly that the df government was attempting to â€œappeaseâ€™â€™ muslims. mr munde wanted a retired judge of the bombay high court to inquire into the mumbai police blunders in the mohammad afroze case. â€œeven 90 days after afroze was arrested, the city police could not file the charge-sheet,â€™â€™ mr munde said. he was participating in a discussion in the assembly, held under rule 293, on the recent riots in kalyan. â€œthe df government failed to initiate action against janata dal leader nihal ahmed who played a dubious role in the malegaon riots last year. those who took out a procession with a photograph of osama bin laden during the malegaon riots have gone unpunished,â€™â€™ the bjp leader said. â€œthere is a well-planned strategy to weaken the nation.the simi and other such anti-national agencies are supported by isi. arms and ammunition have been unearthed in madrassas. temples, mosques or gurudwaras should not be misused in the name of religion. there have been many cases of the use of illegal weapons in communal violence. ak-56 and grenades and bombs find free use in the state. mr bhujbal, when will you act?â€™â€™ mr munde asked. earlier, leader of the opposition narayan rane described the recent kalyan riots as a â€œpre-meditated planâ€™â€™ against the majority community. mr rane fired a salvo at the vilasrao deshmukh ministry which, he alleged, had failed to curb the escalating communal violence in the state. the simmering differences over pota between the congress and the nationalist congress party (ncp), which are major allies in the eight-party df alliance, coupled with the general apathy of the city police to tighten the screws on mohammad afroze have given currency to the impression that crime enjoyed state patronage, mr rane said. the shiv sena leader said that the kalyan riots were â€œstage-managedâ€™â€™ and that the hindu households in rohidaswada, a basti of the dalits and the muslims, were systematically targeted by the rioters who came from outside. the riots, which began on april 9, left five people dead, including local sena activist ashok walunj who was lynched by a mob. property worth over rs 30 lakhs has been destroyed in the violence. mr rane claimed that the morale of the state police had plummeted under the df rule. â€œthe police seems skeptical whether to act or not against the offenders in communal riots. even if senior police officials gather courage to act in accordance with the law, they risk punishment from the political bosses as has happened in case of (former mumbai police commissioner) ramdeo tyagi,â€™â€™ the shiv sena leader said. he added, â€œthe state home department has gloriously failed to tame the deteriorating law and order situation.â€™â€™ while underscoring the â€œselectiveâ€™â€™ approach of the df government to communal violence, mr rane said mr deshmukh, accompanied by aicc chief sonia gandhi, visited malegaon in october last year following riots.a powerloom centre, malegaon boasts of a pre-dominantly muslim population. â€œthe cm distributed largesse of rs 2 lakhs to the next of the kin of those who died in malegaon. on the other hand, no such assistance has been offered to the hindus of kalyan,â€™â€™ mr rane said. bjp mla jagannath patil, who represents the kalyan assembly constituency, contested the police claim that ncp corporator iqbal shaikh, who has been accused of instigating the mob in kalyan, was arrested last saturday. â€œactually, iqbal offered himself to the police,â€™â€™ said mr patil. earlier, speaker arunlal gujarathi succumbed to the combined pressure from the sena-bjp combine for a discussion on kalyan riots, but only after adjourning the house for four times amid commotion. in a retake of the monday melee, the sena-bjp mlas mounted unprecedented pressure on the speaker to allow a debate on kalyan riots, an issue which has come handy to the opposition combine to beat the ruling df alliance with. in fact, the opposition was ready with an adjournment motion on the issue. however, allowing the adjournment motion would have led to voting on the floor of the house. with the treasury benches showing a remarkably thin presence, the vilasrao deshmukh ministry was not prepared for the acid test. instead, the speaker, quoting earlier rulings and guidelines laid down by kaul and shakdher, a learned tome on parliamentary procedures, allowed a debate under rule 293, which does not necessitate voting. but before he resolved the crisis, mr gujarathi surely had a tough time taming the irate sena-bjp mlas who walked up to the well of the house, demanding the resignation of chief minister vilasrao deshmukh for the â€œfailureâ€™â€™ of his government to tackle the deteriorating law and order situation. the contingent of angry sena-bjp mlas was led by, among others, mr gajanan kirtikar (sena), mr raj purohit, mr arun adsad and mr hemendra mehta (all bjp). the mandatory question hour was lost in the din as also the presentation of the reports of the standing committees on rural development, water conservation, school education and agriculture.

12,State minister to meet George on NDZ,"pune: in a significant development, state urban development minister jaydatta kshirsagar gave an assurance on monday that the state government would seek an appointment with defence minister george fernandes to find some ""pragmatic"" solution to the vexed issue of declaring the entire area within 900 metres from the boundary wall of lohegaon air force station as a ""no-development zone (ndz)."" replying to a calling attention motion raised in the legislative assembly by bopodi mla chandrakant chhajed, the minister said he was aware of the problems that would be created in case the defence ministry order was implemented. while raising the point on the floor of the house, chhajed said the notification dated may 22,2001 restricting any construction in area up to 900 metres from the periphery of the defence installation has created unrest among lakhs of residents settled in the vicinity of the air force station. he said the earlier order of the defence ministry restricting any construction up to 900 metres from the bomb dump was much more ""practical"" and would not create any housing problems. chhajed also told the house that the process of rehabilitating the residents and paying compensation to those who own land in the proposed ndz area would cost more than rs 5,000 crore.

13,RJD minister’s son accused of killing boy,"patna: a day after senior congress leader mahabir prasad gave a clean chit to the rabri devi government, a relative of bihar assembly speaker sadanand singh was kidnapped at kahalgaon in bhagalpur district. if that was not enough, the high-profile son of an rjd minister allegedly killed a 12-year-old boy in an indiscriminate firing early tuesday morning. but the greatest surprise was that though these incidents took place in the morning, dgp r r prasad was not aware of them till around 5 pm. a visibly annoyed rjd supremo laloo prasad yadav had to ring up the sps of bhagalpur and madhepura to get the confirmation of these incidents. speaker sadanand singh stated that the kidnapped boy, sagar, is the grandson of his cousin brother. â€œhe and his younger sister were going to school on a rickshaw. as the rickshawwalla went to fetch another boy, sagar was kidnapped. his sister was given a chocolate by the kidnapper,â€� the speaker said, adding that the house of his cousin is very near his home at kahalgaon. mohammad ishar of puranibazar locality at madhepura was killed allegedly by vishal kumar yadav alias babloo, son of minister rajendra prasad yadav, when he indiscriminately fired at a crowd. the firing reportedly resulted in the death of ishar and injury to two others. the incident occurred when an orchestra was performing on the occasion of chaiti durga puja. an fir was lodged by the deceasedâ€™s father in this connection with the local police station even as an angry crowd demanded the arrest of vishal. the minister, speaking on telephone from madhepura, denied the involvement of his 22-year-old son in the incident and stressed that a fabricated case has been lodged against his son because he is contesting in the municipal polls. sources at madhepura say that the minister has already worked out a â€œdealâ€� with the complainant in order to hush up the case. the rjd supremo responded by stressing that sons of a lot of politicians are a curse to their fathers. â€œthey wield all sorts of power and indulge in all sorts of deeds; sons of very few politicians are free from these vices,â€� he maintained, adding that the law would take its own course. but bihar needs firm action and not words for controlling crime. the state has acquired great notoriety with ministers and their kin taking the law in their own hands and kidnapping becoming its only profitable industry. last week, patna witnessed an agitation when a prominent businessman, manoj kamalia, was gunned down. even as the police resorted to lathicharge on the agitating businessmen, it took the state government more than three days to react by shifting a local police officer. the strong demand for posting a direct ips officer was virtually turned down on the plea that no such ips officer wanted to go there. in nawada district on april 16, a pramukh was killed. the fir lodged in this connection alleged that controversial rjd minister raj ballabh yadav and his â€œhenchmenâ€� were behind the killing. even after a week, the state government has not taken any action on the fir. this has led to the charge that the rabri government is adopting double standard. â€œin the case of aditya singh, the district magistrate and sp of nawada had sent a report to the government confirming his involvement after which he was dismissed. later, it was found that aditya singh was not involved in the murder. in the case of raj ballabh yadav, the district authorities have sent no report,â€� explained laloo. incidentally, the union home ministry report on crime in india in 1999, which is frequently quoted by the rjd-led government as saying that biharâ€™s position was 23rd, states that patnaâ€™s rates of murder and kidnapping are the highest in the country.

15,NCW indicts Gujarat govt,"new delhi: after the severe indictment by the national human rights commission and national commission for minorities, the national commission for women on wednesday accused the gujarat government of ""failing to perform its constitutional duty"". expressing its displeasure over the steps taken by the state government in handling the riots situation, ncw chairperson purnima advani said even after more than a month had passed, police had not registered firs in cases of violence against women and ""the number of firs registered was much less than the incidents of violence against women reported to the ncw."" ""women have complained of extreme violence including some cases of sexual assault. many have lost their family members, their homes, their livelihood and their dignity. confidence of affected women in the police authorities has been eroded,"" advani, who was releasing a report on gujarat prepared by a ncm committee, which visited the riot-hit cities and relief camps, told reporters. however, refusing to fix responsibility for failure to prevent the communal riots in gujarat, she said the commission was more concerned about rehabilitation and relief work vis-a-vis women.
