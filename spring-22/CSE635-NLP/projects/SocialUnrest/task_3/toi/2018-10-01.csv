1,Seminar on laws related to women kicked off,"ahmedabad: a two-day seminar on 'the strategies for effective implementation of the judicial-legal systems' described in the national policy for women's empowerment-2001 was kicked off on saturday. laws related to children, health, labour social issues and matrimonial rights of women were discussed at the seminar jointly organised by chetna and the national commission for women (ncw). ""there are many laws that the government has enacted but now the time has come to create a mindset to implement these laws. the women empowerment policy envisages social, political, economic and cultural rights of women and we should strive to fulfill the task of generating a public awareness campaign about the policy,"" stressed member-secretary of ncw reva nayyar. concern was expressed about the provisions related to registration of a genetic centre/laboratory under the prenatal diagnostic techniques (regulation and prevention of misuse) act, 1994. another area of contention is that no surprise mechanism or periodic checks by the inspectors has been provided for to implement the act. ""this is essential as the offences under the act are committed jointly by the medical person in collusion with the pregnant woman or her relatives, thereby preventing them from approaching the appropriate authority,"" said indu capoor of chetna. in the session on health-related legislation, the participants felt although the medical termination of pregnancy act, 1971 creates a specific offence, where the pregnancy is terminated by an unregistered medical practitioner, complaint or redress is specified. ""no provision has been made for an unmarried woman who has become pregnant on account of rape, but is not in a position to take good care of the child either financially, emotionally or socially,"" said capoor. more than 100 delegates from gujarat, maharashtra, rajasthan, madhya pradesh and chhatisgarh are participating in the seminar to discuss and recommend strategies for change in the legislations related to women.

6,Scindia played historic role in state polls,"pune: madhavrao scindia was not a frequent visitor to the city. but one of his most significant visits was in july 1999. the maratha-dominated politics of the state was playing out its familiar historic script of infighting. congress strongman sharad pawar had hoisted the flag of dissent by setting up the nationalist congress party (ncp) and both lok sabha and assembly elections were at hand. as party general secretary in charge of the state, scindia returned to the land of his ancestors to play an important role. a staunch sonia gandhi loyalist, his challenge was to mobilise the party to meet the threat posed by sharad pawar's newly-formed nationalist congress party. he focused his attention on the western maharashtra constituencies of satara, karad, sangli and kolhapur where pawar had a strong following. it was a historic coincidence that the gwalior-based maratha prince's ancestors came from this same region - satara district in western maharashtra. the congress's most prominent leaders converged on his base in the city, the hotel blue diamond's presidential suite, during his stay. besides senior congressmen like suresh kalmadi, mpcc chief prataprao bhosale, pawar's protege-turned-adversary ramakrishna more, another low-profile congressman was waiting to meet scindia. the man was none other than vilasrao deshmukh, just back from the political wilderness and, as it turned out, the man who would be king. barely five weeks later, deshmukh was sworn in as chief minister of maharashtra. during that visit, scindia rightly predicted that the party would not suffer a debacle in the absence of pawar. he averred that the congress would perform better than pawar's ncp in maharashtra. ""we may not get as many as 33 seats as we did in the last lok sabha elections, but we will definitely do better than the ncp,"" he was quoted as saying in the times of india of july 24, 1999. pawar's influence, he has said, was limited to pockets of the state, and although he had caused a split in the party, much of the organisation was intact and that was important, scindia had rightly observed.

10,Trinamul to skip meet on bandh ban,"kolkata: the trinamul congress will stay away from the all-party meeting convened by chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee on monday to discuss the banning of bandhs and blockades by political parties. ""before holding an all-party meeting, the chief minister should put his own house in order,"" trinamul congress spokesman pankaj banerjee said on sunday. for two days last week, the left front organised a rally blocking all the four traffic lanes on the busy rani rasmoni road. former chief minister jyoti basu as well as smaller partners of the front had said that they did not want to surrender the ""democratic right"" of blocking roads and railway tracks. according to banerjee, all-party meetings were really of no consequence to the cpm. in august, an all-party meeting was held in midnapore on the division of the district, but finally, the cpm's draft proposal was accepted by the state government as its decision. on earlier occasions, pleas for holding all-party meetings by the trinamul congress had been rejected by the state government. after the floods in 1998, it had suggested the holding of an all-party meeting on restoration. it had also proposed all-party meetings on the closing down of factories and on ""killing of political opponents"" by the cpm. in any case, the stand of the trinamul congress on road blockades was known, the party was against creating disruptions, banerjee said. that's why most of the agitations by the party were organised on saturdays, sundays and other holidays. the cpi(ml)-liberation, in a statement, criticised the state government's move to ban militant agitations. ""as long as the government will continue with its anti-people policies and actions, the people, too, will carry on their agitations,"" the statement said. the party also condemned the ""harassment of muslim people"" in the name of searching for isi agents, especially in the districts of nadia, murshidabad, malda and north 24-parganas.
