2,BJP MLA in torn 'kurta' begs for development,"FEROZEPUR:It was an unusual scene- local BJP MLA Sukhpal Singh Nannu clad in a torn kurta and begging for money on Tuesday. Nannu, along with other BJP activists, was requesting the residents to donate money for various development works in the city.

With local residents including lawyers, students, and government employees lining up to put money in the box, Nannu had managed to collect thousands of rupees within minutes.

Political observers said Nannu was trying to show his concern for the people, and also was delivering a political message that the Congress government was indifferent to the sufferings of the locals.

A retired educationist Amb Singh,who also contributed to the drive, said that Nannu was left with no choice but to collect money by begging.

He added that it was a constructive act as mostly politicians did nothing but stage a dharna to protest against government''s inaction.

Another passerby Janinder Goyal said such a drive would awaken the government and even provide a chance to the local legislator to win the sympathy of the common man.

Talking to Times News Network, Nannu said he had started this campaign to highlight the indifferent attitude of the local administration and the Municipal Council, who had failed to provide basic amenities to the residents.

He alleged that the local MC had not even allocated a single rupee to 11 wards in the city from the Rs 75.80 lakh funds allocated under UD-8 C scheme by the District Planning and Development Board for the various development works.

He also said that before starting this begging drive, he had knocked at every official''s door to get the motors of the Public Health department repaired as and even raised the issue in the Punjab Assembly and before the chairman of the District Planning and Development Board.

He said all this made no difference, and he was left with no choice but to take the issue to the court of the common man and beg to initiate development in the city.

3,BJP takes out rally against Biman Bose,"KOLKATA: The BJP is taking out a rally on Wednesday night to laud Justice Amitava Lala''s order restricting rallies and processions on weekdays, and to criticise Left Front chairman Biman Bose for opposing the high court directive. In keeping with the court order, state BJP leaders will lead the procession out on the streets only after 8 pm.

BJP leaders will march to Rani Rashmoni Road, where they will burn Biman Bose''s effigy in protest against his tirade against Justice Amitava Lala for passing the order, party general secretary Rahul Sinha said on Tuesday.

""We fully support Justice Lala''s order,"" Sinha said. ""Fifty people going in a procession cannot take away the right of 5,000 people to walk freely. slogans like maanchhi na, ''cholbe na'' and ''bhenge dao'' have destroyed the work culture in West Bengal. We must move away from them.""

However, BJP''s partner in the NDA, the Trinamul Congress, doesn''t share its enthusiasm on Justice Lala''s order. Trinamul spokesman Partha Chatterjee said that holding meetings was ""a democratic right"", though he emphasised that his party usually organised processions and meetings on Sundays to avoid inconvenience to office-goers. ""Except on July 21,which is a sacred date for the party,"" he said.

Neither the BJP nor the Trinamul attach significance to the differences they have on the rally ban. ""We are united on the basis of a common minimum programme but we are two different parties with many differences,"" BJP state president

Tathagata Roy said. ""We are together to oust the CPM from power,"" Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy agreed.

Both parties were, however, critical of the Left Front chairman''s tirade against Justice Lala. If the high court doesn''t take suo motu action against Bose, the BJP plans to file a contempt petition against him when the high court reopens after the Puja vacation.

""There was no reason for a personal attack on the judge,"" a Trinamul leader said. Sinha termed Bose''s statements an attempt to ""destroy the judiciary"".

The BJP will ask its district units to hold conventions to condemn Bose''s criticism of Justice Lala. ""When the court passes a judgement against Murli Manohar Joshi or Narendra Modi, the CPM lauds the judiciary. But when an order goes against its interests, it wants to destroy the judiciary,"" Sinha said.

4,Amar Singh to head State Development Council,"LUCKNOW: In a major decision, the Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday decided to set up a state Development Council having representation of captains of Indian industries under the chairmanship of Samajwadi Party''s (SP) national general secretary, Amar Singh. Singh will have the rank of a cabinet minister.

A decision to this effect was taken at a cabinet meeting presided over by chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav here today after the distribution of portfolios among his jumbo size 98-member ministry on Monday.

The star-studded council will be represented by Anil Ambani, Subrata Roy, Adi Godrej, Amitabh Bachchan, Kumar Mangalam Birla, MS Banga, chairman, Hindustan Lever and AV Kamat, retired chairman, ICICI bank.

Briefing newsmen, chief secretary AP Singh said the state officials who would be on the council are; investment commissioner and principal secretaries of industries, finance, trade-tax, environment and power, besides two other secretaries to be nominated by the CM.

The council, to be registered under the Registration of Societies and Chit Fund Companies Act, will be a high-powered body, whose recommendations will be taken into account by the cabinet develop the state. While there will be no fixed tenure of the council, it will have its office in Yojna Bhawan, near CM''s secretariat annexe.

Amar Singh is Mulayam''s undisputed choice. And this is not without reason. In fact, the Samajwadi Party (SP) owes much to Singh, who has pitchforked the party on to the national scene and has brought industrial houses closer to the state. Singh''s role in the council is equally important and it could go a long way in helping the governance of the state.

The council is Yadav''s way of saying thanks to his friends in the industry, most of whom found time to attend his oath-taking ceremony here on August 29 at a short-notice and making the event enviable to the chief minister''rivals.

On the face of it, the council appears to be impressive. All it needs is to embark sincerely upon its goal of paving the way for the industrial development, which is lacking in the state. How much the council will deliver only time will tell.

By another decision, the cabinet decided to keep alive the five ordinances due to expire.

They are related to the civil procedure court in which district judge has been given the power to hear the compensation cases up to the limit of Rs 5 lakh instead of just Rs 1 lakh, hike in the fees of the advocate general, trade-tax rules simplification and the UP cooperative sugar mills besides the UP lawyers welfare fund in which collection money has been increased from Rs 5 to Rs 10 from lawyers at the recommendations of the Bar Council.

5,Cong leader arrested for power fraud in slums,"NEW DELHI: The economic offences wing of Delhi Police on Tuesday arrested an electricity contractor, who happened to be the vice chairman of the Badarpur Block Congress Committee, for cheating power consumers in south Delhi slums.

The police admitted that the accused, Devender Awana, claimed to be a Congress leader. â€˜â€˜We had information that Awana, an electricity contractor in Jaitpur extension near Badarpur, was extorting money from consumers. He was charging Rs 700 from every consumer for installing a transformer in their area. He says that he is associated with the Congress,â€™â€™ stated deputy commissioner of police (EOW) Dinesh Bhatt.

â€˜â€˜He is used to misusing his political connections for personal gains,â€™â€™ said a senior police officer. The police said that he was also charging a minimum of Rs 200 from those consumers whose consumption was seven or fewer units. â€˜â€˜The rate for seven units is fixed at Rs 1.5 per unit. Two residents complained to the police. We managed to arrest the accused, who was absconding,â€™â€™ said Bhatt.

Investigations revealed that Awana had forcibly taken over the work of providing electricity connections in the area. Sushil Kumar had reportedly been handed over the contract to provide electricity connections in the area. Kumar, however, went underground after collecting a huge amount of money from the residents. The accused had supplied 1,000 connections.

Over 100 people turned up as witnesses against him,â€™â€™ said Bhatt. The police said that on September 29 he had started a fire in his office in an attempt to destroy evidence against him. â€˜â€˜He set his office in Jaitpur extension on fire and called up the police and fire office,â€™â€™ said Bhatt.

6,Bungling alleged in election work,"PATNA: Chief whip of the BJP legislature party in the state assembly Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha has alleged large-scale bungling in the selection of polling booths and preparation of revised electoral roll in Bihar.

He also accused the govt machinery of acting as RJD agents. He was talking to newsmen here on Tuesday at the partyâ€™s state headquarters.

He said rationalisation of polling booths has not been done in accordance with Election Commission (EC) guidelines. Polling booths have been set up even at a distance of five kilometres from the place of residence of voters against the maximum permissible distance of two kilometres only.

Sinha said that despite complaints to EC secretary S K Kaura during his Patna visit, no action was taken against officers responsible for bungling in the work of rationalisation of polling stations and preparation of electoral rolls.

He said that this has boosted the morale of officials who have violated the EC guidelines.

These officials, he said, neither prepared draft list and maps of polling stations as per the instructions of EC given in annexure VI of the handbook of returning officers.

The draft list, along with the maps, were not provided to recognised political parties and the sitting MPs and MLAs to solicit their objections before sending them to the CEO for approval.

Sinha said in a large number of cases new polling stations, where majority of voters come from weaker sections of the society, mainly Dalits and extremely backward castes (EBCs), have been set up in areas dominated by RJD supporters, in sheer violation of EC guidelines.

The guidelines give specific direction to identify the localities predominantly inhabited by weaker sections and locate polling stations in these localities irrespective of the number of voters. But, it has not been done.

The BJP leader showed revised voters list which did not contain the names of villages and mohallas of the voters. Even the name of Patna DMâ€™s father has not been rectified in the revised electoral roll, despite complaint.

He said that the electoral rolls of booth no. 334 of the Patna West assembly segment and booth no. 151 of the Sonepur assembly segment of Saran district are identical.

7,NDA leaders hit out at govt,"KISHANGANJ: NDA convener and defence minister George Fernandes assured the â€œVikas rallyâ€� here on Tuesday that the border roads in this district, hedged by Nepal and Bangl-adesh, would certainly be improvised within the parameters of his ministry.

Fernandes spoke very briefly at the huge rally held at the historic Ruidhasa ground here. When asked by a reporter about the likely fallout and impact following the Left Front governmentâ€™s public defiance of Kolkata High Court judgment banning rallies in Kolkata on week days, he said he was yet to study the whole thing.

Railway minister Nitish Kumar said that the NDA government at the Centre was just not committed to usher in a new era of prosperity and development throughout the country, but also to develop a new Bihar.

He said at least 40 lakh people went outside in search of job and added that it was strange that the RJD-led government, instead of doing anything on its own, rather implored the Centre just not to provide funds but also direct its agencies to do everything for it.

The railway Minister prophesied the downfall of the 13-year-old RJD government which had run out of steam.

He said RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, instead of harping on his favourite theme of social justice, was rather singing the secular song under duress from the Congress and to placate the Leftists.

Dr C P Thakur said that over 30,000 people had been abducted during the last 13-year rule of RJD-led government in Bihar which had now become a synonym for all kinds of mayhem, rape and kidnapping. He asked the Yadavs and the minority communities to go for a self-introspection before extending support to it.

Leader of the opposition in the Bihar assembly Sushil Kumar Modi made a blistering attack on Laloo Prasad Yadav and asked him to give his own assessment of development in Bihar before making any snide remark against the purposeful and performing NDA government at the Centre.

Union textile minister Shahnawaz Hussain, who pooled all the resources at his command to make the â€œVikas rallyâ€� a historic event, for a change, did not deliver any speech and rather acted as a moderator and monitor. Nonetheless, Hussain, fuming fire and brimstone, targeted the state building construction minister and RJD leader for trying to hog headlines and arrogating to himself for all that the NDA government rather did.

Civil supplies minister Sharad Yadav and agriculture minister Hukumdeo Narayan Yadav also assailed the Bihar government for putting roadblocks to the juggernaut of development and distracting attention. Sukhdev Paswan, MP, also addressed the rally.

10,President's cavalrymen arrested,"NEW DELHI: The rape of a 17-year-old student of the Jesus and Mary College by four Army jawans on Monday has once again sent alarm signals about the safety of women in the Capital.

Senior police officers are alarmed that the jawans had the audacity to commit the crime in broad daylight at a public place.

''''The presence of so many people in the garden failed to deter the accused,'''' a police officer said. The Dalai Lama was attending a public function in the gardens, along with a number of dignitaries from India and abroad around the time that the crime was committed.

Even more appalling is the fact that the accused were posted with the security wing at Rashtrapati Bhawan. The police, who had arrested one of the accused â€” Harpreet Singh â€” on Tuesday, rounded up the three other accused â€” Satinder, Manish and Kuldeep â€” on Wednesday.

A police officer said: ''''After receiving the complaint, we arrested Harpreet and immediately informed the Army authorities. The other three were handed over to us by the Army.''''

It was learnt that the accused visited the forest area in Buddha Garden regularly in search of fodder for horses in Rashtrapati Bhawan. ''''Sometimes, the horses were taken there for feeding,'''' an officer said.

The accused had constructed a dwelling unit inside the forest to rest during such visits. ''''It seems that Harpreet, after committing the offence, changed his clothes, put a lock on the door from outside and went behind the bushes to sleep,'''' he said.

During interrogation, Harpreet revealed the identity of his accomplices. The police have found the military uniform that Harpreet was wearing. It will be sent for a forensic test.

On Wednesday, a city court sent the accused to Tihar jail. Army spokesman Colonel Anil Shorey said: ''''We are extending full cooperation to the police.'''' He said the Army was unable to take action against the jawans.

''''The force is not allowed to initiate action in heinous crimes like homicide or rape. Such crimes come under the jurisdiction of the civil police,'''' Shorey added.

He said the Army would take action once the trial is over.
