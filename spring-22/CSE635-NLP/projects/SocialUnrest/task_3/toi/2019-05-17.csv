1,First riot-arrest on rape charge,"AHMEDABAD: After all the hype over the Kausar Bano case in Parliament, the prime accused in this case, which was part of the Naroda-Patia massacre, Ratilal Rathod, 50, alias Bhavani Singh, was arrested by the city crime branch late on Monday night.

Rathod works with the Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service as a driver. This is the first riot-arrest made in the city on charges of rape and murder. Interestingly, on Monday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee stating that a separate FIR be filed in this case and the investigations be carried out by the CBI.

The arrest comes 11 weeks after the incident shook the city with its gory details being repeated over and over again at the Shah- e-Alam relief camp. The incidentâ€™s sole eye-witness, Jannatbibi Kalubhai Hidubhai Shaikh, claimed to have seen the eight- month pregnant Kausar Banoâ€™s stomach being ripped open by a sword, the foetus removed and swirled on its end, flung around and then burnt. Shaikh also claimed that the woman was first raped.

It must be noted here that Shaikhâ€™s complaint was included in the same FIR 100/2002 of Naroda- Patia only on May 2 and section 376 (rape) roped in. Eighty-six persons had been hacked and then burnt alive during the Naroda-Patia slaughter.

Interestingly, Rathodâ€™s son is a lawyer and they reside in the Gangotri societyâ€™s first house located just where Jawannagar ends. Kausar Bano lived in Jawannagar in Naroda-Patia.

â€˜â€˜I had approached the police time and again but leave alone lodging an FIR the investigating officer did not even wish to take note of my narration,â€™â€™ said Jannat Biwi. Sources said the matter was hastened after Sonia Gandhiâ€™s letter to Vajpayee.

For over two months after the incident on February 28, a police inquiry, headed by an additional police commissioner, had remained inconclusive. The Naroda-Patia, an area which houses around 800 residential quarters, case had later drawn in no less than 756 FIRs of which 598 were registered by eye-witnesses and riot-victims sheltered in different relief camps like those at Shah-e-Alam Roza and Dariakhan Ghummat.

During her visit to Ahmedabad and Godhra soon after the riots, Sonia along with an all-party delegation on a fact-finding mission was not allowed to visit the Shah- e-Alam Roza camp lest such matters get â€˜â€˜blown out of proportionâ€™â€™.

Sources said four other cases with rape and murder charges have been registered against accused named in FIRs lodged by the riot-victims.

â€˜â€˜Offences have been recorded after investigations have proved that those accused had instigated the mob,â€� the sources said.

2,Parishad mourns deaths of Gujarat riot victims,"Lucknow: The Vidhan Parishad on Thursday paid rich tributes to four former and one sitting MLC besides offering its condolences to the families whose members were killed in the Gujarat carnage and more recently in the Shramjeevi Express derailment. Rich tributes were also paid to poet Kaifi Azmi and Lok Sabha Speaker GMC Balyogi.

As soon as the House assembled pro tem Speaker Manvendra Singh placed the obituary references.

They included those of Shyam Sunder Sharma, Shiv Pratap Singh, Siya Dulari and Santosh Kumar Kapoor who were former members of the House as also for the victims of the Gujarat bloodbath and the Shramjeevi Express accident.

Leader of the House Swami Prasad Maurya mourned the death of Satya Narain Tewari, a sitting MLC, and said he was like an elderly figure who always gave right guidance and actively participated in the discussions.

Sheema Rizwi recounted the efforts made by Tewari in setting up a â€˜Nikah grahâ€™ in a minority dominated area, where the residents could not afford such a building.

The poetic excellence of Kaifi Azmi and his relentless efforts in forging communal harmony were recalled by MLCs like Om Prakash Sharma and Panchanan Rai of the Teachers Group, Dauji Gupta and Ghyas-ud-Din Kidwai of the BSP, Leader of the Opposition Ahmed Hasan, Ram Sumer Yadav of the CPM and Rajesh Mishra of the Congress.

Recalling Azmiâ€™s unparalled â€˜shairiâ€™ they said he always strove to spread the message of brotherhood and thought nothing of leaving the comforts of Mumbai and returning to his birthplace Mijwa in Azamgarh to ensure that it got the modicum of civic amenities.

There was no dearth of Urdu and Hindi couplets by the speakers in praise of Azmi, who described Azmi as not only a national but an international figure.

The Godhra carnage and its aftermath was condemned in the severest possible terms for the agony it had bestowed on the families of those who were killed in the senseless violence.

The MLCs said the outbreak of the carnage in Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s home state made a mockery of the tenets of Ahimsa, which the Father of the Nation had preached to the world.

Strong exception, however, was taken to the attempts made by Dauji Gupta to lighten the atmosphere. Senior Samajwadi Party leader Ram Sharan Das said obituary references were a serious issue and should not be taken lightly.

5,Kin deaths drive man to suicide,"KOLKATA: Unable to bear the loss of his son, who died in a road accident, and of his wife and daughter, who committed suicide soon thereafter, retired West Bengal Public Service Commission officer Krishnadhan Ghosh (65) ended his life on Thursday in the same room where his wife and daughter had hung themselves in February.

His 26-year-old son, Bappaditya, a thalassaemia patient, succumbed to a road accident on February 16, exactly three months ago.

Unable to bear the grief, the boyâ€™s traumatised mother and sister committed suicide the very next day. Two sons have survived â€“ Ranjan, an interior decorator, and Achintya, who works in a private firm and lives at Baguiati and their sister Anita who is married.

Two years ago, they had lost their sister Moumita to thalassaemia.

â€œMy father had shifted to our house in Baguiati. He used to give tuition to keep himself occupied. On Thursday, he went to Ghosh Lane at 9.30 am. He called me from there and reminded me that my mother and sister left us on this day and that I should bring four bouquets,â€� said a visibly shocked Ranjan.

His sister called up their Ghosh Lane residence later in the day. When there was no answer, she called up her brother and on reaching the spot, found her father hanging from the ceiling.

According to Bimal Dey of Amherst Street police station, Ghosh had left a suicide note for his children saying that he was finding it difficult to cope with the trauma and decided to end his life.

â€œThe body has been sent for post mortem. He has also left a will and separate letters for his sons,â€� Dey said.

7,8 reservoirs are incomplete,"VIJAYAWADA: As many as eight service reservoirs to supply drinking water to different parts of Vijayawada are either lying incomplete or awaiting inauguration after completion.

Half of the work is complete in the three lakh gallon capacity reservoir at Priyadarshini colony at Bhavanipuram, taken up at a cost of Rs 78.43 lakh. It should have been completed by December 2000.

Work on another reservoir of the same capacity at Bhavanipuram lorry stand in Vijayawada has not yet been taken up though it was sanctioned Rs 74 lakh two years ago.

The two lakh gallon capacity reservoir at Four Pillars Centre at Vidyadharapuram needs only some minor work for completion. Ironically, these areas are located hardly two km from the river Krishna and also the Vijayawada Municipal Corporationâ€™s (VMC) head water works. But people of these areas in Vijayawada face acute drinking water scarcity, particularly during summer, due to the non completion of service reservoirs.

Same is the case of residents of Krishna Lanka area, which lies right on the banks of the river. The three lakh gallon capacity reservoir taken up at a cost of Rs 75.28 lakh should have been completed by December 2000. However, not even a small portion of the work has been completed so far.

The contractor abandoned the work mid way as he was not assured of payments. The reservoir at Mutyalampadu could not be taken up at a cost of Rs 66.11 lakh because of land acquisition problems.

For two years now this project has been hanging fire due to non-availability of site. The one lakh gallon capacity reservoir at Kothapet was completed three months ago but not inaugurated so far.

Had this reservoir been opened, it would have solved the water problem in that area. There is no progress in work on a similar reservoir at the Srinivasa Mahal area in Kothapet. This reservoir is intended to supply water to households on the hilltop in Kothapet area.

In Vijayawada, the total length of the water distribution network is 380 km while the pumping main is of 40 km length. At least half of the water distribution lines need immediate replacement as they have outlived their utility. The drinking water pipelines in several areas like Governorpet, Gandhinagar and Satyanarayanapuram were laid several decades ago.

Residents of these areas complain that the worn out pipes were often leading to contamination of drinking water resulting in diseases.

The budgetary allocation for capital and ordinary works related to water supply was cut from Rs 2.22 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 66 lakh in 2002-03.

Non-allocation of sufficient funds is hampering important works like replacement of pipes and construction of reservoirs, sources in the VMC told The Times of India.

8,Auditor didn’t verify SPF investments in gilts,"MUMBAI: The government auditor who examined the accounts of the Seamenâ€™s Provident Fund (SPF) did not physically verify the fundâ€™s Rs 92.78-crore investments made through Home Trade and Gilt Edge companies, say the fundâ€™s trustees.

The audit was done by a Principal Audit Officer PAO), a subordinate of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), a statutory auditing body. The CAG office did not reply to this correspondentâ€™s queries.

The investments were allegedly made by former SPF commissioner Anup Kumar Gond between 1998 and 2002.

The principal audit officer who checked the SPF accounts did not ask Mr Gond to produce the certificates showing he had actually invested the money in the secondary market through Home Trade and Gilt Edge, say the trustees of the fund.

Both Sanjay Agarwal of Home Trade and Ketan Sheth of Gilt Edge are in the custody of the CBI. Their premises have been sealed.

Failing to verify the investments violates fundamental auditing methods, government auditors agree. The auditing officer only wrote a single sentence in his audit report for 2000-01 that â€œthe investment pattern along the prescribed norms have not been disclosed..â€™â€™.

A member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Jayant Gokhale, said that it appeared that either the auditing officer was misled or he did not follow basic auditing principles.

After the scam broke, Mr Gond was grilled by the trustees of the Seamenâ€™s Provident Fund on May 10 for over six hours. He told the trustees that the audit officer did not ask him to hand over the investment certificates. â€œIf the audit was done more responsibly, the trust would have been saved Rs 100 crore,â€™â€™ lamented several trustees.

Until 1995, the Reserve Bank of India handled the investments of the Seamenâ€™s Provident Fund. But the RBI later said it was unable to look after investments that did not fall strictly within its purview and urged the fundâ€™s trustees to let a nationalised bank do this work.

The trustees approached some banks, but their fees were too high. For instance, the SBI demanded Rs 20 lakh to manage the investments.

The trustees felt the amount was too much and they passed a resolution in September 1995 authorising the commissioner to invest in specified government securities.which Mr Gond complied with. After the scam, this resolution has been revoked.

CBI sleuths have charged Mr Gond with cheating by investing Rs 92.78 crore in Home Trade and Gilt Edge.

He had allegedly started investing after Home Trade was started in 1998. The CBI has remanded him to custody and will interrogate him until May 17,when he will have to be produced again in the court.

9,Trinamul flays govt for power hike,"KOLKATA: Leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjee kept up his tirade against the recent hike in power tariff by CESC and said that the power utility and the state government had connived against the people of Kolkata.

â€œThis is a joint operation conducted by CESC and the state government,â€� Banerjee told reporters on Thursday.

The Trinamul leader reiterated that there was no way the consumers could expect justice because both the judges were CESCâ€™s empanelled lawyers.

According to Banerjee, the CPM had once again let loose a terror campaign on Trinamul party workers before the panchayat elections.

â€œOur party office in Khardah was destroyed on Wednesday night by CPM-backed miscreants. When I spoke to Asim Dasgupta about it, he sounded as if he did not know about it,â€� Banerjee said.

The Trinamul camp alleged that CPM-backed miscreants had badly roughed up attacked a woman activist from North 24 Parganas district on May 11. Mamata Banerjee will write to Union home minister L.K. Advani on CPM â€˜atrocities.â€™

10,3 hurt in PW-ML clash,"PATNA: Three Naxalites were injured in a clash between the Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist-Liberation (CPI-ML-Liberation) and the outlawed Peopleâ€™s War (PW) at Bharatpur village in Patna district, leading to tension in the area, a senior police official said on Thursday.

Trouble started when a group of CPI-ML(L) supp-orters led by Indu Paswan shot and injured a Peopleâ€™s War activist, Prithvi Raj, in the village under Dulhin Bazar police station on Wednesday night following an altercation over a local issue, inspe-ctor general of police (operation) Neelmani told reporters.

In retaliation, the Peopleâ€™s War ultras attacked Paswanâ€™s house, injuring two CPI-ML(L) activists.

The CPI-ML(L) office here claimed that four houses of its supporters at the village were blown up by the Peopleâ€™s War.

The IG (operations), however, denied the allegation. Police patrolling was intensified in the entire area, he added.

11,HC seeks replies from lawyers,"PATNA: A six-judge bench of the Patna High Court, consisting of Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan, among others, resumed the hearing of contempt matter against 12 lawyers accused of locking the gates of the Patna City court on Thursday.

The courtroom was packed, and about 100 hundred lawyers, who did not find room inside, stood in a crowd outside the courtroom. The atmosphere was surcharged.

Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the president of the coordination committee of various associations of lawyers in the Patna High Court, said the report of the district judge, on which the Patna High Court has started the contempt process, has not been served on those charged.

Only a preliminary show-cause has been submitted, he added. Mukherjee also said that lawyers charged never locked the court premises, which was also borne out by the inquiry of the fact-finding committee of members of the superseded Bar Council.

This view was echoed by Rajendra Prasad Singh, the president of the lawyersâ€™ association, and the secretary general of the advocatesâ€™ association, Yogesh Chandra Verma. Singh also said that lawyers had always strived for the rule of law and had a direct interest in its maintenance.

The arguing lawyers explained that lawyers were officers of the court and were concerned about upholding its dignity. In the interest of the institution, the cases should be withdrawn, and the issues like filling of vacancies and delay in disposal of cases should be addressed.

The protesting lawyers were only trying to draw attention of the society to these issues, they maintained.

Justice Dhavan said that the only issue before the bench is whether the lawyers locked the court premises and obstructed the administration of justice. The bench directed the registry to serve all relevant papers to the accused.

12,India express dismay over US farm subsidies,"NEW DELHI: India said on Thursday the recent US action inceasing subsidies to farm products does not augur well for the future of the multilateral trading system and raises doubts about the ongoing negotiations.

Speaking at a special session of OECD ministerial council in Paris on the Doha work programme, the Commerce and Industry Minister Murasoli Maran referred to the increase in subsidies given by the US to agricultural products under its Farm Bill and said: ""Poorer countries who were also at Doha really expected that subsidies would be reduced and phased out and they are deeply disappointed.""

""This is does not augur well for the future and raises fundamental doubts about the ongoing negotiations.""

Expressing concern over slow progress made by developed countries in resolving WTO implementation issues and increasing subsidies, he said it could erode support for the multilateral trading system.

""Doha and Mexico should not prepare the ground for another set of implmentation issues. An impression is created that in matters of interest to developed countries, the work programme in WTO gets accelerated whereas in areas where developing countries have a lot of interest, progress tends to be slow and halting,"" Maran said.

""This trend should be corrected... Global trade majors who need to play important leading roles should act as role models. Otherwise it will send negative signals. It may also erode support for the multilateral trading system.""

The minister said work programme on implementation issues should be given highest priority since there were indications that time-frame fixed for resolution of these issues may not be adhered to.
