2,TN govt decision puts egg farmers in a spot,"bangalore: the discontinuation of eggs in the midday meal for schoolchildren in tamil nadu since november has affected egg farmers of karnataka and of other states too. with the consequent glut in the market, there is a marginal decrease in the price, and farmers are in trouble. under the scheme, the tamil nadu government used to buy about 75 lakh eggs a week. apart from improving the nutritional standards of the beneficiary children, this scheme also provided some relief to the poultry farmers by stabilising egg prices. ``with the discontinuation of eggs in the scheme, these 75 lakh eggs are finding their way to the open market and have reduced the egg prices all over india by at least 10 paise, thus wiping out the entire margin of profit to the farmers,'''' says anuradha j. desai, chairperson of the national egg co-ordination committee. incidentally, tamil nadu is one of the largest egg producers in the country. the namakkal-salem-erode region has the highest concentration of poultry population and it is growing by almost 40 to 50 per cent a year. the surplus eggs from tamil nadu are marketed in far-flung areas like uttar pradesh, bihar, north-east and delhi. hence, a drop in the price of eggs in tamil nadu will have a cascading effect on the price of every other market and lakhs of farmers may lose their only means of livelihood. poultry industry circles are worried that unless the tamil nadu government reverses its decision, lakhs of farmers will be hit badly. over the past three decades, poultry farming has transformed itself from a backyard activity into a modern and scientific industry. with an annual production of 37,000 million eggs, india is the fourth largest egg producer in the world. poultry is also the fastest-growing segment within the agricultural sector. it contributes over rs 12,000 crore to the gross national product and provides employment to over 1.6 million people, mostly in the rural areas, second only to agriculture. india''s present per capita consumption of about 36 eggs is far below the national institute of nutrition''s recommendation of 180 eggs per capita. ``an increase of one egg in the per capita consumption can result in 26,000 additional employment opportunities,'''' says anuradha. despite beneficial contributions to society, the poultry sector faces a difficult, if not uncertain, future because of reasons beyond the farmer''s control like spiralling feed costs and unremunerative prices.

3,Head of varsity law faculty removed,"mumbai: seven months after a mumbai university committee found law faculty head p.c.warke guilty of examination malpractice, the university has decided to remove him from the post. mr warke had earlier been divested of his position as dean of the law faculty, but remained department head. on tuesday, however, the universityâ€™s board of examinations decided to remove him from that post, too. â€œthe move should have come much earlier,â€™â€™ a department head said. â€œby letting a tainted person remain as head, the university was sending out wrong signals to all those breaking the rulesâ€™â€™. a report submitted last august by the unfair means committeeâ€” which looks into cases of examination malpractice at the university â€” said that mr warke had wrongly increased the marks of an ll.m (master of law) student and recommended that he be excluded from all exam work. the committee began work in march last year after the universityâ€™s examination section found certain documents in a consumer law answer-sheet assessed by mr warke. these included an advocateâ€™s visiting card and a note saying that the student should be given 15 more marks to clear the exam. mr warke gave the student exactly 15 additional marks, which investigations later revealed, the student did not deserve. though mr warke denied all allegations of malpractice, the committee asked two examiners to reassess the answer-sheet. both gave the students more or less her earlier marks, the unfair means committee stated in its report. the university did act on the committeeâ€™s report, but faculty members felt that officials were wrong in letting mr warke remain as head. an association of law professors even sent letters to governor p.c. alexander, ex-officio chancellor of all universities in the state, demanding that action be taken against mr warke. in its letter, the law professors association said that the university was selective in taking action against those found guilty of exam malpractice. â€œno fir (first information report) has been filed against mr warke who continues to head the faculty,â€™â€™ says the letter, sent to the chancellor in march. the university filed firs in the case of four studentsâ€”including that of former registrar a.m. murudkarâ€™s son ajayâ€”whose answer-sheets were found to have been tampered with.tuesdayâ€™s action follows a missive from the chancellorâ€™s office. vice-chancellor b.l. mungekar told this newspaper that â€œthe case was reopened after the chancellorâ€™s office forwarded some representations made to the governorâ€™â€™. moreover, a university committee â€”appointed to decide what action should be taken against those guilty of examination malpractice â€”recently suggested that those indicted should not be allowed to hold any high positions. â€œthis rule was meant for colleges but we have now decided to implement it at the university level as well,â€™â€™ mr mungekar said. asked why there was a delay in taking this step, the vice-chancellor said that the university had already removed mr warke from all work associated with exams. â€œas head, he was not directly concerned with exams, and we did remove him from his deanship.â€™â€™

10,"Gujarat betting over riots, too","ahmedabad/vadodara: transcending the cricket arena, the euphoria for betting and gambling has acquired an appallingly insensitive form â€” that too in the already communally-charged gujarat. after the godhra tragedy and the myriad bouts of bloodshed that followed, the residents of gujarat are fast realising that humans themselves are the worst forms of evil. so, no wonder that they are getting accustomed to rumours and speculation on where exactly the next riot would wreak havoc. if reports are to be believed, the die-hard gamblers of gujarat have been placing bets over the last one month â€˜â€˜on where the riots would break out, where curfew would be imposed and what the death toll would beâ€™â€™. as for the time interval for each betting, sample this: at the time of filing this report, rumours were doing the rounds in ahmedabad that â€˜â€˜ghodasar area needs to be watched tonightâ€™â€™. although the police top brass refuse to accept that â€˜â€˜wagersâ€™â€™ were being placed to trigger riots, what gives credence to the reports now trickling in from various cities of gujarat is the recent arrest of some persons in jaipur for placing bets on whether the gujarat riots would spread to rajasthan. in rajkot, there are reports that as many as 16 bookies have been heavily gambling on the riots. while the 16 bookies were operating from sanganwana chowk, their partners were active in gundawadi, kevdawadi, jungleshewar, sardhar, janakpuri and race course. most betting was done â€˜â€˜on who would start the violence and in which areaâ€™â€™, sources said. the amounts placed on betting varied from subject to subject. in suratâ€™s outskirts, betting was on the â€˜â€˜death toll in the communal turbulence in different parts of the state, mainly ahmedabad and vadodara. sources close to bookies said, â€˜â€˜several small-level punters evinced interest in the number of the persons likely to be killed in the worst affected parts of the state. betting amounts depended on the volatility of the situation, city-wise.â€™â€™ in ahmedabad, too, one of the biggest bookies confirmed that riot-related betting was restricted only to some small-time operators. â€˜â€˜we are not the kinds to speculate on something which could mean life or death to someone,â€™â€™ said the bookie who operates from the manek chowk area.

11,Activists rip apart Gujarat rioters,"kolkata: city intellectuals on tuesday appealed to president kr narayanan to intervene and stop the â€˜fascist onslaughtâ€™ in gujarat in order to save the minorities as well as democratic hindus. decrying the attack on the media and narmada bachao andolon activist medha patkar, they passed a resolution at a meeting held at nandan complex lambasting the narendra modi government for â€œcontinued collaboration with the riotersâ€�. the meet also accused prime minister atal behari vajpayee of handling the gujarat situation with â€˜kid gloves.â€™ many speakers demanded immediate removal of modi. â€œthe sabarmati ashram violence was not just an attack on the media, but an attack on every citizen of the country,â€� said playwright chandan sen. novelist debesh roy pointed out that the assault on patkar was an effort to gag the movement for alternative development, which is opposed to state-sponsored mega projects. â€œevery riot is a device to displace, uproot and devastate a section of people by vested interest. gujarat is no exception,â€™â€™ remarked ecologist jaya mitra. â€œitâ€™s another attack on toiling masses and efforts to divide them,â€™â€™cautioned scientist samar bagchi. naxalite leader azizul haque greeted the muslims as well as large section of hindus both in gujarat and in other states for not being provoked by the â€˜sinister fascist designâ€™ to make a multi-religious, multi-cultural country into a monolithic one. mitra cited examples of hindus who saved the lives of muslim workers from west bengal during the month long carnage in gujarat. however, miratun nahar and others expressed worry about the spreading of communal passion even in west bengal. â€œpolitics should be at its own place. the intellectuals record the tremors in the society. when we are tossed apart by another kind of earthquake in gujarat, we should not hand over our seismograph to others,â€� said theatre personality rudraprasad sengupta in an oblique criticism of the left intellectuals for their failure to hit the streets before the ruling left front decided to react. artist subhaprasanna urged the bengal fraternity to unite and co-ordinate with their brethren all over the country against communal frenzy. the meeting was presided over by the former vice-chancellor sushil mukherjee. other speakers included goutom chattopadhaya, hosseinur rahman, sunanda sanyal, nausad ali. the poignant mood was reflected in the songs and recitations of artists like saonli mitra and subhuendu maiti. bhasa o chetna samiti activists collected funds for the gujarat riot-victims.

12,Are those 'missing' in Ahmedabad riots dead?,"ahmedabad: little javed hussain, all of 14, today has nobody to turn to in big, bad gujarat. nine family members, including his parents, have been ""missing"" since the riots broke out in the state from february 28. where could they be now? were they killed by the mobs? could they have decamped leaving the young one behind? such unanswered questions shroud the whereabouts of no less than 300-odd riot-affected persons in ahmedabad alone. javed recounts, ""i had somehow managed to escape when a mob set some of my neighbours on fire. my father was a tailor and we used to live in naroda-patia. many of our acquaintances tell me that my parents along with six others were among the victims of the naroda-patia carnage."" but till date neither has javed seen the bodies nor has he got any post-mortem report to stake claim for the promised rs 1.5 lakh death compensation. the organiser of one of the largest relief camps in city at shah-e-alam roza, mohsin qadri, says, ""we have submitted a list of such ambiguous cases to the collectorate. of these, some like in the case of the gulbarg society speak of all family members being wiped out. we can only hope that better sense will prevail upon the authorities and they will help these hapless victims, who have nobody to turn to now."" of the 127 missing cases recorded at the shah-e-alam roza camp, only five have received death certificates or post-mortem reports to show. at the dariakhan ghummat camp in shahibaug the situation is much the same. the kin of 104 riot victims registered till date, only a few have managed to establish their claims. in-charge of this camp, ataullah khan, says, ""we are still compiling details on those who are missing and those who have proof of death and yet have not got compensated. the number of those termed as missing by far outstrips those with documents."" madinabano hussain is beside herself with grief. she was married just for 45 days before riots tore her life apart. today as she nurses a stab wound on her stomach, she is faced with a dilemma. neither can she presume her ''missing'' husband, arif hussain, is dead, nor can she carry on life hoping that he will come back some day. her sister-in-law bilkis bano, who used to reside in naroda gam says, ""the riots took away four family members. two brother-in-laws, my mother-in-law and my husband have been missing since february 28. though i am sure they are no more i do not have any means of proving this. search at all relief camps and city hospitals have given more pain than relief."" the saijpur area in the outskirts of city too has many such cases of missing persons. rabiabibi badani lives on to tell a tale of seven family members, who seem to have disappeared from the face of earth. tears wet her cheeks as she points at the names in the list of missing riot victims - nadim hussain sheikh (4 months), arif hussain sheikh (6), sabbir hussain sheikh (6), saminabanu sheikh, zubeida banu sheikh (28), sabbir hussain sheikh (32) and kudratbibi sheikh (55). her husband, faruq badani, who works as a salesman with a local firm, says, ""their status is a mystery for us. we did not even see the mortal remains, let alone being given a post-mortem report by any of the hospitals. we are still tracking down people who might have witnessed the carnage and at least tell us what fate befell our dear ones.""

13,New rules for Madhyamik orals,"kolkata: the madhyamik oral examinations will be conducted by external experts, not by teachers of the studentsâ€™ respective schools. the west bengal board of secondary education is likely to implement this decision from 2003. the step seeks to stop irregularities under the present system. â€œafter i took over last year, i started reviewing the oral examination results of different schools all over the state. i was shocked by what i saw,â€� board president haraprasad samaddar told tnn. the present pattern gave ample scope to cheat, often with teachersâ€™ connivance, sammadar admitted. â€œteachers of government and government-aided schools are to be blamed equally and i will not let them continue like this,â€� he said. in the madhyamik examination, a student appears for seven compulsory subjects (bengali, english, mathematics, physical science, life science, geography and history) and one additional subject (the examinee chooses from 39 subjects). in all the compulsory subjects of 100 marks, the examinee appears in a written examination of 90 marks, which is externally assessed. for the remaining 10 marks he has to appear in an oral test, assessed by his school teacher. while going through results of oral examinations taken from schools across the state, samaddar found cases where an examinee scored 10 in his oral test and two or three out of 90 in his written test. â€œin some other cases the opposite happened. while a student scored one or two in his oral test, he scored 70 in the written test. obviously, this poor boy or girl was not a favourite with the teacher! i have discussed the issue with the minister of school education and we have come to the conclusion that such an unfair system of internal examination should be remodelled,â€� samaddar said. the board is finalising teams of experts who will visit schools for conducting oral tests for madhyamik 2003. â€œa board official will accompany each team,â€� samaddar said. the questions for the oral examinations will be set by the board and given to the team and will no longer be finalised by school teachers â€” as is the present system. hindu school principal bishnu charan chatterjee said, â€œi donâ€™t think such unfair practices are taking place in my school, but we will have to honour the decision.â€�

20,'India attracts less FDI due to govt policies',"washington: indian government''s policies made it difficult for the country to attract foreign investors due to which its full potential of receiving foreign investment hasn''t been realised, a leading financial institute representing major international banks has said. india has made progress in building its access to global finance and there have been some positive signs, but the country, ""still makes it exceptionally difficult for foreign investors"" who want to bring portfolio or direct investment, managing director of the institute of international finance, charles dallara, said. foreign investors have work their way through ""a labyrinth"" of laws relating to capital and labour, and even today investors have to deal with multiple layers of the government, he said. the environment for attracting capital remains ambivalent, he said adding, in addition, ""you have to deal with a fiscal situation that still needs stronger actions."" the vast indian economy has shown potential but ""if it is going to attract serious, substantial amounts of foreign capital, it will have to address these other problems,"" dallara said. the economic growth in most emerging market economies is subdued, as are private capital flows to these economies, the institute said in a press release. ""net private flows are likely to be about $160 billion this year, as are private capital flows to these economies,"" it said. the institute said: ""net private economies are likely to be about $160 billion this year, an increase from $130 billion in 2001 but well below the levels of the mid-1990s when they reached $233 billion. ""net capital market borrowing is expected to be modest at only $27 billion while net bank lending is likely to continue to be negative. moreover, foreign direct investment is forecast to fall to $117 billion this year from $139 billion in 2001 and an average of $137 billion over the last five years."" while there has been little direct ""market contagion"" from the crisis in argentina, which ""has broken every law"" relating to foreign investment, and to date investors have differentiated between emerging market economies, said dallara, investor confidence is stil greatly influenced by polcies that support a reliable business climate. ""''policy contagion'' influenced by the damaging action on business confidence in argentina could weaken foreign direct investment to emerging markets more broadly."" the institute is greatly concerned that the imf and other institutions may lend to argentina before the country has settled with foreign creditors. in a letter to the ministers of finance and central bank governors, who will be attending the forthcoming imf and world bank committee meetings, he warned: ""the risk of policy contagion could be magnified if a new funding arrangement were agreed between argentina and the imf before a comprehensive policy framework is developed that addresses fundamental investor concerns.""
