0,J&K minister resigns over 'terror links',"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir agriculture minister Abdul Aziz Zargar resigned on Thursday over allegations linking him with those who planned the attack on the Akshardham temple in Gujarat last September.

The minister protests he is innocent and has no knowledge of his native house being used by the attack planners, as has been revealed in the interrogation of Chand Khan, the key figure in the conspiracy.

â€œTill my name is finally cleared and I am sure it will be cleared, I may be kindly allowed to relinquish my ministerial responsibilities in the best tradition of public life,â€� he said in his resignation letter.

â€œIn spite of my firm belief and conviction that I have nothing to hide and there is nothing in reality which could compromise my position as a public figure including as a minister, I feel that I should not cause any undue embarrassment or inconvenience to the government I belong,â€� he said.

Chand has given a detailed account of the entire plan and how it was carried out; corroborating evidence supports what heâ€™s said. Chand Khan says he was paid Rs 30,000 for taking the two Akshardham killers to the ministerâ€™s native house, at Manz-gam in Anantnag district.

And has also said the Ambassador car used to take explosives to Srinagar for the attack was also examined at the same house by the commander of the Lashkar unit who decided on the strike.

Zargar says he left that house 13 years before, at the eruption of insurgency; it is located near forests in a remote area. He hasnâ€™t visited the house since. Hence, he said, there is no question of any links between the insurgents and him.

1,BJP 'books' Ram temple for polls,"NEW DELHI: With the release on Friday of a booklet which contains two articles by deputy PM L K Advani, the BJP hopes to make Ayodhya a central issue in the forthcoming elections.

The book, Ayodhya ka gavai, includes an article by Advani summarising the Ayodhya movement. The article was written when he was arrested after the demolition of the Babri masjid and lodged in the Mata Tila guesthouse near Jhansi, party spokesperson P Javdekar said.

The booklet also contains articles by two senior journalists who say they were eyewitnesses to the demolition and claim that Advani had no role in it.

The release of the book comes at a time when the Rae Bareli court is hearing the Babri Masjid demolition case, in which Advani along with other senior BJP leaders have been implicated.

It also follows Advaniâ€™s statement in Bangalore that the ASI report on Ayodhya excavations had proved the BJPâ€™s point that the Ram Temple existed at the disputed site and that it would strengthen the partyâ€™s position on the issue.

2,Education houses to protest hill strikes,"DARJEELING: Educational institutions have finally decided to take a stand against the frequent strike-calls in the hill region. On Tuesday, heads of 19 educational institutions in Darjeeling, comprising primary, ICSE, CBSE, Madhyamik schools and colleges , decided to form an association to oppose the frequent strike calls.

The outfit will be known as the Association of Heads of Educational Institutions of Darjeeling. The new association comes in the wake of a three-day-strike in all educational institutions called by the students'' union council of Darjeeling Government College, demanding an increase in the number of college seats.

According to the headmaster of St. Joseph''s College (School Department), Father Kinley Tshering, frequent strikes hamper education.

In many places, education and health institutions are kept out of the purview of the strike, but it is only in Darjeeling where educational institutions are asked to close down, creating a lot of inconvenience. So there was a necessity to have a common forum of all educational institutions so that we too can have a say.

The association which has formed an ad hoc body will meet soon for the formation of its constitution. The main objective of the association is to look into the welfare of the students and guide them positively in the present education situation. Father Kinley said that the association will support issues pertaining directly to education but not give in to strong-arm tactics.

3,Winter to herald contract farming,"KOLKATA: Contract farming is set to be ushered in West Bengal from the coming winter, with the state government deciding to introduce the new agricultural policy in the rabi season.

CPM state secretariat member Binoy Konar, however, allayed fears that farmers would lose possession of their agricultural plots with contract farming. The entry of capitalists in the farm sector would be restricted to agreements, under which industrialists would ask for ''tailor-made products'', supply inputs and technology and buy the entire output, he added.

It is wrong to say we are guided by the McKinsey report in adopting this policy, he told TNN on Wednesday. Farmers'' wings of different Left Front partners have agreed to this policy.

At Deganga in North 24-Parganas, a private entrepreneur has already planned to set up a unit for scent manufacture. For this, he would promote the cultivation of aromatic plants and flowers in a 100-acre area. The farmers will cultivate their own plots, Konar emphasised.

Such contract farming to promote food processing was being planned mainly in the potato-growing areas of south Bengal, pineapple growing areas of north Bengal and tomato rich areas in Purulia, where prices were falling because of high production, he said.

Konar admitted to the risk that the buyers could offer low prices to farmers, and said that the CPM-dominated Krishak Sabha wanted that the prices at which farmers would sell their products to entrepreneurs be fixed beforehand. Panchayats could also be parties to these agreements, he said.

The manufacturers knew best what kind of processed products would sell in the market, Krishak Sabha secretary Samar Baora explained.

They might require pineapples of the elongated variety, which would fit their cutting machines. The new agricultural policy will also seek to encourage production of wheat, oilseeds and pulses.

4,"'It's natural rain, not govt rain'","HAVERI: For Haveri farmers, it was a case of losing hope too soon. The ryots, who expected rain following the cloud-seeding operations on Wednesday, were disappointed it did not materialise.

The frustration was obvious as the district was hit by drought for the third consecutive year. The government had declared all seven taluks of Haveri as drought-hit. Sources said the area did not receive rain because of the absence of ''rain-bearing clouds''.

Thursday, however, brought some hope as the town received rain for about five minutes, but not with the aid of cloud-seeding. â€œIt is natural rain, not the government rain,"" people said.

The N234K aircraft involved in the cloud-seeding operations arrived in the district on Wednesday evening.

Captain Aravind Sharma told The Times of India that the cloud-seeding will be done for 4-5 days.

However, with the launching of campaign for the bypoll, ""the candidate issue has become a non-issue. But we will definitely submit an honest report to the party high command on the situation in the party and follow-up action would be taken,"" he said.

To a question, he said it was the responsibility of all Congressmen to work for the victory of the Congress candidate, John.

Moily who held a detailed discussion with Karunakaran here on Wednesday along with another AICC observer G.K. Vasan, said, ""Karunakaran will not do anything that will mar the prospects of Congress candidate. We told him that your sentiments would be taken care of by the high command,"" Moily said.

Maintaining that the Congress in the state was united, Moily said internal brickerings should not come in the way of the victory of Congress candidate.

8,Inquiry into fake arrest in passport scam,"HYDERABAD: An inquiry has been initiated by the north zone deputy commissioner of police on Thursday into the alleged nexus between Begumpet police officers and passport racketeer M Ramachandra Reddy.

The DCP has started the inquiry following a report published by The Times of India. He will look into the circumstances that led the Begumpet police officers to pass off an arrested man as the ''kingpin'' of the fake passport racket.

It is learnt that the officers had agreed to show the arrested man, Raghu, as racket kingpin Ramchandra Reddy, leaving alone for a ''consideration''.

The north zone police had arrested close relatives of Ramachandra Reddy on July 11.

They were paraded before the press at a press conference addressed by the DCP on that day and photographs of the kingpin and his family were shown to the press.

Begumpet inspector Y Devadanam, despite having photographs of the accused in his possession, had told The Times of India on Wednesday that they could not identify Raghu before announcing the arrest.

Curiously, the police identified Raghu correctly before he was produced before the court and slapped an impersonation case against him.

11,Red-tape takes its toll on salaries of govt,"PUNE: Red-tape, which has haunted many a citizen, is now taking its toll on government employees .

Hundreds of employees of irrigation development corporations such as those in the Krishna Valley, Konkan, Vidarbha,Tapi and Godavari irrigation development corporations, receive their salaries after more than a monthâ€™s delay, all due to an extraordinary procedure adopted by the government.

The irrigation employeesâ€™ union, which took up the matter with irrigation minister Ajit Pawar, irrigation secretary Nandkumar Vadnere, MKVDC executive director K.D. Shinde and MKVDC chief engineer Suresh Pakhare on Wednesday, bemoaned that their salary files had to pass through not less than 20 tables before they actually got payment.

Speaking to TNN on Thursday, Ramesh Agavane, chairman, co-ordination committee of irrigation and public works department employees, explained that once a demand for salary and allowances is put up to the irrigation department, officials prepare separate salary proposals for MKVDC and other four corporations.

The proposal then travels to finance-I section in the irrigation department via a steno, desk officer, additional secretary, finance advisor and chief engineer.

It then reaches the irrigation secretary. After his approval, the file is sent to the finance department for approval.

The file then travels through a steno in the finance department, public projects department, finance division and reaches the joint secretary finance (expenditure). It is then forwarded it to secretary (audit) and treasury and principal finance secretary (finance).

The journey does not end here. The file is again sent to the finance department for writing down the cheque number. It then travels back to the irrigation department, in a process that consumes 20 days. Throughout this journey, it has to be closely pursued and pushed by union members to hasten the process.

In the next phase, the irrigation research and development department issues a credit letter following receipt of the file sanctioning salary payment. The executive engineer issues a cheque, which is registered with the treasury.

Before registering, the treasury officials have to take permission from the finance department, Mantralaya and director (audit and treasury), which takes five days.

Agavane said that although the state government has set aside Rs 300 crore for salary payment for 2003-04, the employees do not get timely payments.

The irrigation employees have suggested that the financial allocation be handed over to the director of irrigation research and development department or be given to the chief accountant or finance officer in respective irrigation corporations.

â€œSince they are government employees, they can release the salary payment after getting the signature of the executive director of the corporation,â€�Agavane said.

12,Media report blamed for farmers' suicide,"MANGALORE: The farmers'' suicide in the state was termed as ''political suicides'' by the head of the Department of Psychiatry in Kasturba Medical College Dr V K Bhat, on Wednesday.

He alleged that it was committed to get compensation from the government. Speaking on the subject ''Role of Medical Profession in Suicide Prevention'', on the occasion of the first World Suicide Prevention Day, at Sushrutha Hall of KMC Hospital, Dr Bhat also lambasted the media for ''over reporting'' such cases of suicides, which made many more farmers get into the ''suicide mode''.

He said the compensation amount may be the reason behind such suicides. Dr Bhat added that in 2000, an estimated 815,000 people committed suicide around the world, representing one death every 40 seconds. If this continued, by the year 2020, nearly 1.5 million people would be dying of suicide alone, he added.

He also said the KMC was planning to open a Suicide Prevention unit at the hospital soon. Dr Bhat said that since a number of mental disorders are significantly associated with suicide, the early identification and appropriate treatment of the condition is the key to prevention.

Interventions based on the principle of correctness and easy access and availability of help such as Tele-Check, has provided encouraging results, he pointed out.

Restricting access to the means like pesticides, herbicides and poisonous drugs are equally significant in preventing suicides, he said adding that the potential impact of media on suicide rates suggest that the tone and language used. It also highlighted how the graphics encourage imitation suicides.

14,Mulayam govt runs on ministers without portfolios,"LUCKNOW: In the corridors of power, yet another strange phenomenon. After taking over the reins of power, UP Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav may have got on board six new ministers but their biggest predicament is that these ministers are sans any portfolio.

Despite all the governmental paraphernalia that comes with ascendance to power, the brood is simply killing precious time. Time that could be better utilised for doing developmental work, which is once again relegated to the background.

Since Mulayam Singh is in Delhi virtually no work was carried out during the last one week. Despite the fact that six ministers have been allocated an office in the Vidhan Sabha, Mohd Azam Khan was the only one to attend office and meet a few people.

Yadav''s brother, Shivpal Singh Yadav also met people at the party office while Kusum Rai has just returned from Vindhyachal. Meanwhile, minus their ministers departmental secretaries have resorted to sending their files directly to the chief minister. This is perhaps the first time that ministers have remained without a portfolio for so long.

15,Teachers cease work in protest,"JALANDHAR: The colleges under Guru Nanak Dev University in Jalandhar, Amritsar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr and Gurdaspur districts ceased work on Friday, after two periods. They held rallies to remind the Punjab government about the acute financial crisis in the 172 non-government colleges in the state.

It was a step to tell the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh that the Congress did not fulfill the election promises in respect of regular salaries, CPF and retiral benefits to the staff of these colleges.

Dr V K Tewari, PCCTU general secretary, said the Congress had promised to continue the 95 per cent grant scheme for these colleges and to implement the pension gratuity benefits. But the government had failed to honour the poll promises.

The demonstrators today targeted the Higher Education Minister Harnam Dass Johar and the Finance Minister Lal Singh for having failed to resolve the crisis in higher education. On the other hand the bureaucrats were busy blocking the salaries of 7000 teachers in 172 colleges.

He said a large number of colleges were violating the terms of the 95 per cent grant scheme, by denying the due and regular salary and CPF.

The university statutes on payment of due salary every month, were also being violated, Dr Tewari said.

16,"Quit or act, SC tells Modi govt","NEW DELHI: Short of suggesting dismissal of Narendra Modi''s government in Gujarat over its failure to get the accused involved in murders and rioting punished, the Supreme Court on Friday said the ""government should quit if it cannot punish the rioters"".

Taking the Modi government to task over its apathy towards the victims of riots, particularly the Best Bakery case in which all the 21 accused were acquitted for want of evidence, the court questioned Modi government''s ""raj dharma"".

""I have no faith left in the prosecution and the Gujarat government. I am not saying Article 356 (President''s rule). You have to protect people and punish the guilty. What else is ''raj dharma''? You quit if you cannot prosecute the guilty,"" an anguished Chief Justice V N Khare said.

When state government''s counsel and additional solicitor general Mukul Rohatgi said that it was not an earlier system in which the chief ministers depended on the mercy of others as ""he is elected democratically"".

The Chief Justice made it clear, ""Democracy does not mean you will not prosecute anyone.""

The Bench comprising the Chief Justice and Justices Brijesh Kumar and S B Sinha was hearing the petitions filed by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and key witness in the Best Bakery case, Zaheera Sheikh, seeking reinvestigation and retrial of case outside Gujarat.

The court also termed as ""eye wash"" the state government''s appeal before the High Court in the Bakery case. It also doubted the government''s intentions on punishing the guilty and observed that ""it should quit if it cannot punish the rioters"".

The court took serious view of the grounds of appeal and ordered that the chief secretary and director general of police be present in the court on September 19 to answer as to ""who has drafted such an appeal"".

Warning the state government that it would not be a silent spectator to all these acts and incidents, the Bench said ""We will do it if the state keeps silent in its prayers before the High Court.""

The Bench said, ""We do not have any trust left in your prosecution agency. There appears to be some collusion between the government and prosecution. It is a case where 14 people were burnt alive and is this the way prosecution is conducted"".

Rohatgi pleaded with the court not to have an impression of collusion between the government and the prosecution. He said that the apex court should await the outcome of the appeal before the High Court.

The Bench said ""what impression will one get if one looks into the appeal. The way you have conducted the prosecution before the trial court and the way you have filed the appeal, it appears you will repeat the same before the High Court.""

""Is this an appeal? You do not take any plea and it is for the courts to do everything. Even a counsel with one year''s experience will not draft such an appeal. I know there are several eminent lawyers in Gujarat,"" the Chief Justice said.

Earlier, NHRC counsel P P Rao said that the trial court had observed that whenever riots took place, the police invariably arrived late and then indulged in roping in wrong persons and creating wrong evidence.

Saying that the trial courts were helpless when the prosecution provided wrong facts and wrong accused, the Bench said, ""We have absolute faith in them. But if you do not bring facts and evidence before them, what will they do than acquit the accused?""
