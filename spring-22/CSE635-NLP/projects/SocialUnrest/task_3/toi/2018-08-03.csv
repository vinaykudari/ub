0,"Parents, schools fail to curb violence in class","new delhi: a class monitor tries to discipline his classmate for climbing the window. kicks him in the groin. four days later, the boy dies on his way to hospital, apparently from the injury. new delhi: a class xi student bludgeons his schoolmate following a minor fight. littleton (colorado): two students kill 12 of their classmates and a teacher. similar attacks reported in pearl, mississippi west paducah, kentucky jonesboro, arkansas and springfield, oregon. they are separated by miles - geographically and in terms of development. yet, the propensity to be violent among children is identical, and it is alarmingly on the rise. the recent killings and violent bouts in schools, especially in government-aided or government-run schools in the capital, have exposed how both our education system and the family have failed to temper the baser instincts in our children. and both have major contributions to make in worsening or improving the situation. with corporal punishment banned by the supreme court and counsellors made compulsory for all cbse-affiliated schools, containing violent tendencies in children can no longer be left to the 'growing up' process. shreya dutt (name changed), a teacher of a government-aided school in karol bagh, blames the parents and overburdened teachers for the situation, not to mention the most common whipping boy, the idiot box. ""children are exposed to various foreign channels, and most portray violence. then, most children who come to government-run schools see violence in their homes. wife-beating is very common. in schools, with teachers so few and classrooms jam-packed, we can barely make ourselves heard, leave alone pay attention to each student,"" dutt said. ""the blanket ban on corporal punishment has left us helpless,"" says sushma rani arora, a teacher with sarvodaya vidyalay, rohini (sector 6). ""some students need it. worse, parents come complaining if their children are reprimanded. especially, in government schools, parents of students are not educated enough to educate their children,"" she said. according to arora, poverty also contributes to aggression. ""they have little to spend on what they know they could have had, thanks to the information age. the frustration turns into aggression."" ditto is the case for those with too much to spend, says subodh sinha, a teacher with cambridge school. ""the nouveau riche indulge their children. they are not interested in 'real' education. they themselves hold degrees but are not aware. there is too much restlessness in this generation,"" she says. ""for some children, aggression is an expression that gives vent to their emotions,"" said seema taneja, a counsellor with amity international school. ""a child could be aggressive if he is hyperactive, triggered or due to exposure to violence at home. we need to channelise that aggression so that it is expressed in a socially acceptable manner,"" she said. citing an example, she said: ""there was a child who was teased by his classmates because he had body odour. he became irritable and aggressive. we later found his parents would not bathe him in the morning. parents have to cooperate."" consultant psychiatrist with vidyasagar institute of mental health and neuro sciences, jitendra nagpal agrees. ""aggression is a way of dealing with changes during adolescence. what's of concern is the undue rise in aggression and criminal aggression. the influx of information and the urban ethos leave the adolescent with too much to swallow. heightened aggression is the adolescent's coping mechanism. what we need now is a fine blend of discipline and stress-busters. we have to change the way we define adolescence,"" he says.

1,Disunity in BJP election panel,"new delhi: divisions in the bjp have surfaced with delhi mps madan lal khurana, sahib singh verma and vijay kumar malhotra threatening to resign from the city election committee if three nominated members, with allegedly dubious credentials, are not ordered to step down. khurana, verma and malhotra reportedly told state party president mange ram garg on thursday that these members should be removed from the state election committee as their presence had tarnished the party's image. they even threatened to resign if the members were not told to step down. the delhi bjp had constituted the new state election committee last week. the 15-member committee headed by mange ram garg has been entrusted with the task of selecting candidates for the municipal polls due early next year. among its members, three leaders have been involved in anti-party and criminal activities. while one of them was a co-accused in a murder case in 1972, another was suspended from the party on charges of cross-voting in the mayoral elections. another leader was implicated in a spurious liquor tragedy. sources said that verma, malhotra and khurana are upset over their induction. also, they hold a grouse that the state leadership did not consult them while constituting the election panel. khurana, malhotra and verma along with anita arya are the four mps who have been nominated to the state election committee. however, there is resentment among party members for not inducting two-term mps lal behari tiwari and vijay goel. said a party leader: ""both goel and tiwari have a considerable mass base and have served two terms in the lok sabha. they should have been taken in instead of relatively new leaders like anita arya."" delhi mayor shanti desai and leader of the opposition in the assembly jagdish mukhi are also members of the committee, which would be functional till 2003.

2,'It was not to incriminate anyone',"hyderabad: dr kakarla subba rao, author of the book a doctor's story of life & death, said the reference in his book to the death of former chief minister n t rama rao was not done to incriminate anyone. related stories ""all i said was there was some reason -- his (ntr's) fault or somebody's else fault -- that he died the way he did,"" dr subba rao told the times of india on thursday. he said, ""i am sorry and frustrated that i could not help him in his last days."" he, however, said that ""although nims was ntr's pet project, no one was called (on the morning of january 18, 1996, when the former chief minister died)."" dr rao appeared resentful of the change in ntr's attitude after he married lakshmi parvati towards him and cardiologist dr b somaraju rao. he said, ""we (he and dr somaraju) used to meet him often. while dr somaraju used to meet ntr because he was his cardiologist, i used to accompany him during those visits."" rao recalled that during one such occasion, ntr complained about pain in his neck. they advised him to stop wearing the turban he was sporting at the time. ""i was essentially like an overall adviser,"" dr rao said. the radiologist said ntr became off hand towards him after lakshmi parvati came into his life. ""frankly, i distanced myself too because of the hypocrisy of lakshmi parvati. she used to hate to give him to someone else, she did not want to share him with anyone else."" but despite the distance, dr rao says, ""i felt bad that he suffered."" on that fateful day, ntr might have been revived after his cardiac arrest but ""none was called."" asked why he has written the book, dr rao said it was essentially about medicine and about his struggle and ""not meant to bring ntr down."" he said the references to ntr came incidentally in the context of the former chief minister's invitation to him to head nims in 1984. dr b somaraju, when contacted, only confirmed that he was called to ntr's residence on the morning of his death. ""by the time i reached there, he was dead."" asked how ntr had died, dr somaraju said, ""it is difficult to be confident. it could have been a brain stroke or a heart attack because he had both problems."" no autopsy was done to establish the cause of death. somaraju said, ""i was not the first doctor to see him that day."" former tdp mp and the eldest son-in-law of n t rama rao, daggubati venkateshwara rao, claimed that no doctor had been called by lakshmi parvati. he said dr lakshmi reddy, parvati's gynaecologist, was the first doctor to be called in.

9,"MUDA, MCC clash affecting citizens' lives","mysore: the ongoing war of nerves between the mysore city corporation (mcc) and mysore urban development authority (muda) is not likely to end in the near future unless the karnataka government intervenes, feel residents here. the six-month old tussle between the two parties is for ""absolute power"" to collect house tax, grant building plans, kathas and other related documents. the problem has not only confused the officials and the public alike, but has also made it easier for tax evaders. says resident siddharth, ""mysore city is of course a classic example for the adage `too many cooks spoil the broth,"" but i still feel the situation has worsened for the good"". it is not just the mcc and muda, but also the common man who has to wage a war to get the smallest of small chores done by the various departments like the karnataka slum clearance board, department of survey settlement and land, town planning, karnataka water supply and drainage board. ""whenever i call up the mcc office to complain about a choked drain in front my house, the immediate reaction of the officials is to say the layout comes under muda. and muda's answer is vice-versa. i have a feeling that the officials are taking advantage of our ignorance"", says vasu, an aggrieved resident. out of the total 78-km stretch in the city, he said, 48 km belongs to mcc and the rest comes under muda's control. unfortunately, there is no board or notification to specify as to who the property belongs to and it's the same with layouts too. many times the residents register their complaints with the corporation without knowing it needs to be addressed by muda, he added. the fervent appeal of the residents, however, to give autonomy of power to any one of the agencies does not seem to have evoked any response. however, the officials have a different view. on condition of anonymity, a muda official said, the major problem with both these government agencies is they are both financially starved. hence, both are making desperate attempts to gain authority over income generation as the annual grants from the government are spent entirely on the salaries of employees. to think of any developmental programme, he said, they have to either depend on the financial institutions or the state government for extra grants in the name of dasara and other major events. to top it all, each of these agencies have passed a resolution during the last meeting to issue notice to the commissioners heading the corporation and muda and also warn them to stop granting building plans, kathas and other related documents until the government makes it's stand clear on this issue. the agencies have also made an appeal to the state government to settle the matter at the earliest.

11,HC seeks report from govt on basic amenities in villages,"patna: the patna high court on friday directed the state government to explain what steps it had taken for providing five basic amenities to the people living in villages. a division bench comprising chief justice r s dhavan and justice aftab alam had earlier directed the state government to provide to the people at least five basic amenities -- potable water, sanitation, electricity, primary health facilities and primary education. the court made oral observation that despite the order passed earlier the state government had not come forward with a concrete report about providing the basic amenities to the rural people. additional advocate general s k ghosh said that earlier the secretary, public health and engineering department (phed), p n narayanan, had filed an affidavit about installation of handpumps in villages to meet the rural people's need of potable water. on this, the lawyer and secretary of the council for protection of public rights and welfare, m p gupta, contended that the phed's submission regarding installation of handpumps seemed more to be a figure on paper than the ground reality. the matter had come up during the hearing of a batch of 36 petitions which had been clubbed together by the court because the petitions raising different issues had contended lapse of crores of rupees in the form of central aid for different planned projects. during the last 10 years, huge funds lapsed and had to be returned to the centre. the court had earlier directed various state government departments to furnish details of the losses. the court had also directed the state government to provide at least five basic civic amenities to the rural people at the earliest as most of the funds for development had been planned for rural projects.

12,No action by Punjab govt so far,"chandigarh: the punjab government is yet to take any formal decision against senior-most additional director general of police (adgp) ds bhullar though the trial court has already convicted and sentenced him to life imprisonment in a triple murder case. the district and session judge, patiala, had convicted bhullar on wednesday yet the government waited till the announcement of the sentence. but even after the court's announcement of sentence on friday, the government failed to suspend the convicted officer till evening, revealed senior officers. earlier, bhullar was suspended by the government soon after the prosecution had arrested him and produced challan in the trial court. he remained in jail for some months but was later granted bail. as bhullar had enormous political clout among ruling akalis, his suspension was revoked and he was appointed adgp (vigilance) with the punjab state electricity board (pseb) even while the criminal proceedings against him were pending. though a senior officer said the government may be waiting for the copy of the judgment, the experts and senior police officers argued that the police itself was the prosecuting agency and can't take shelter under this pretence. they argued that bhullar must be suspended immediately pending dismissal by the union government. they pointed out that in accordance with the latest apex court ruling, the convicted officer can't hold the office till he is exonerated by the superior court.

13,City law colleges put out wait-lists,"pune: are popular tele-serials like ally mcbeal and novels set in courtrooms the reason why youngsters seem to be beseiging law colleges in the country? for the first time in their chequered histories, all 12 law colleges affiliated to the university of pune have been forced to release waiting lists of students seeking admission to the first year bachelor of law course this year. and while for most the law is a serious career decision, the media is not entirely blameless. there are five law colleges in pune, three in ahmednagar and nasik districts each, and one in baramati. according to a recent government decision, the combined strength of students in the new (five-year) and old (three-year) course in any college has been restricted to 1,600. this has led to a large number of students finding themselves among the 80-odd candidates on the waiting list. the restriction in the numbers had caused serious problems for students attending the prestigious ils law college earlier, but this was sorted out. the year also saw a significant rise, from 55 per cent to 65 per cent, in the passing percentage of students in all the years. this has left fewer seats available in the first year. principal of symbiosis law college m.s. raste says, ""every year we admit 320 students to the first year course. this year, however, only 240 students could be admitted."" he added that an increasing number of students see law education as an alternative to a commerce degree. the dean of pune university's law faculty, sureshcandra bhosale, pointed out that the decision to freeze the number of students was the main reason for the long waiting lists. the issue is expected to be taken up for discussion in the university's academic council meeting on august 16. however, mr bhosale said, even if a nod is given to add more seats by creating more divisions per year, other problems persist. the dean also sees the student rush as an indication of the high academic standards maintained by the university despite a severe resource crunch. the university attracts students from all over the country and as many as 30 per cent of the students are from other states. but students have more amusing reasons to take up the law. symbiosis first year (new course) student akshay chandra from allahabad says john grisham's novels inspired him to become a lawyer, and pune university was the best option available. fellow student varun sriram from chennai says besides the grisham factor, a law degree from pune university would give him a cutting edge in the job market. antara dasgupta, also from chennai, says that in the age of liberalisation and increasing international trade, lawyers will be in greater demand. besides, the aura and respect attached to the profession was what attracted her to this profession, she says.
