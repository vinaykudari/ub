1,"Atal sticks to medal, stays off politics","SANTINIKETAN: If this was an opportunity to launch his Bengal campaign, then Atal Bihari Vajpayee clearly avoided it. If it was a chance to slam the state and its investigating agency Â¨the CIDÂ¨ then the Prime Minister deftly sidestepped any controversy.

But his message was clear. It was ""worrying and a matter of great regret"" that even after eight days the stolen ''national heritage'' hasn''t been found.

""Efforts are being made but these haven''t borne fruit till now. I am sorry to say such inviolable national property should have been more secure. They did not have adequate security,Â¡Â± said Vajpayee,who is also the Visva-Bharati chancellor. ""The vice-chancellor and other officials have assured me they will do the needful."" Yet, Vajpayee wouldn''t blame the CID or the university. He called the wellplanned theft an accident.

""The administration should spare no effort to track the culprits down.... People who stole it had come prepared. They had equipment to do so and knew exactly where these things were kept,"" he said. Asked why Visva-Bharati had stopped short of taking action against any of its staff, Vajpayee said, ""Is it so? I will enquire.""

The last time Vajpayee visited Santiniketan was in 2001. On Friday, he was accompanied by CBI director U.S. Mishra and Union ministers Tapan Sikdar and Mamata Banerjee.

He went straight to the Uttarayan complex, which houses Rabindra Bhavan, from the makeshift helipad at the fair grounds. The state administration threw an unprecedented security cover for the visit. Vajpayee met CBI investigators who gave him an insight into the nature of the crime and the subsequent loopholes in tracking the criminals. Top CID officers also briefed the PM.

2,Time for political migration in AP,"HYDERABAD: It is time for political migratory birds to look for greener pastures in Andhra Pradesh.

As elections draw closer, last-minute defections have hit all major political players in the state and several turn-coats have actually been rewarded soon after arriving at their new political destinations.

The most dramatic political migration was enacted by a sitting city Congress legislator D Nagender, who switched over to the ruling TDP in a wee hour high drama and was rewarded with the party ticket to contest from Asifnagar Assembly seat, which he had held in the dissolved Assembly.

Nagender, the lone Congress legislator from the city which has 13 Assembly segments, was sulking after the party high command asked him to contest from Secunderabad Lok Sabha constituency where the Union Minister and BJP nominee B Dattatreya is seeking re-election.

After agreeing to obey high command''s order, the two-time MLA made a political somersault, approached TDP supremo and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and got himself inducted into the ruling party, hours before the closing of nominations for the first phase of polling on March 31.

So swift was his baptism into the TDP that he was issued ''B'' form by Naidu even before the formalities of enrolling him as primary member of the party could be completed.

In a case of reverse migration, the TDP legislator A Chandrasekhar, who was denied renomination, promptly switched over to the fledgling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and secured party ticket to seek re-election from Vikarabad in Ranga Reddy district.

3,Industrialists' rally set for Saturday,"Patna: The industrialists having their units in Hajipur Industrial Area will observe a dayâ€™s strike on April 3 and take out a rally from Hajipur to Patna to submit a memorandum to governor and chief minister seeking industrial development of Bihar.

The Hajipur Industries Association (HIA) has given a call for the strike in industrial area and the rally, said HIA president Dilip Kumar Churiwal and other office-bearers to newsmen here. They will undertake the 30-km long rally on cars and also on foot in market areas. The rally is also aimed at creating awareness among people over the issue.

The rally starting from Hajipur Industrial Area will pass through Hajipur kutcheri, Patna City, Gandhi Maidan, Exhibition Road, Fraser Road, and Dakbungalow crossing and end at the residence of the governor and the chief minister.

Churiwal said that he and 10 other industrialists of Hajipur Industrial Area have quit Bihar Industries Association (BIA) as the latter was not taking up the cause of industrialists wholeheartedly with the government.

They will now raise the issue of industrial development of Bihar from the forum of HIA.

In the memorandum, the HIA will stress on extending a level-playing field for the growth of industries. For this, the pre-requisites are development of roads, adequate power and water supply and also rationalisation of sales tax, set-off of taxes and other benefits.

Churiwal alleged that â€œthe politician-official nexus has virtually looted the state and eroded its industrial baseâ€�. Further, industrialists are feeling insecure due to bad law and order situation.

He said that the industrialists in Bihar are suffering from double taxation â€” exorbitantly high sales tax and imposition of entry tax on import of raw materials. As a result, the consumers of the state have to pay very high price.

Churiwal said that if the sales tax department opens check posts at 14 points in Bihar, the goverment will start getting Rs 4,000 crore revenue every year.

But the sales tax officials do not want this as their illegal earnings will stop, he alleged, adding that the HIA has already sent suggestion to sales tax department to open check posts at 17 points.

He regretted that recently the sales tax office of Vaishali district had sent letters to industrialists in Hajipur Industrial Area to pay duty for using generator for their industry. Only when the government fails to supply adequate power to industry, does it use generators. But the sales tax department is chasing industrialists to exploit them, the HIA office-bearers lamented.

5,Iraq arrests reveal LeT's global role,"NEW DELHI: The arrest of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) activists near Baghdad in Iraq recently has come as a shot in the arm of the intelligence agencies here which so far had trouble convincing their American counterparts about the Pakistani-based jehadi group being part of the international network of fundamentalist terror.

The Lashkar operative nabbed by US forces in Iraq, Dilshad Ahmad, was responsible for many terror strikes in India. The Pakistani national from Bahawalpur, Dilshad Ahmad, looked after most of the infiltration bids into J&K between 1997 and 2001.

He himself crossed into India on at least half a dozen occasions to oversee the functioning of the Lashkar cells operating in J&K and other parts of the country.

Pre-9/11, US authorities viewed Lashkar terrorists as ""freedom fighters"" - a notion they persisted with till the terror assasult forced them to dump and clamp a ban on the Muridke-based Wahabi outfit.

Intelligence agencies here hope that Ahmad''s arrest will help the American counter-terror officials recognise Lashkar''s affiliation with al-Qaeda and others committed to the goal of global jehad.

This, as well as the arrest of seven British citizens of Pakistani descent who were allegedly plotting a terror attack has once again trained the spotlight on the religious seminaries in the neighbouring country as the ""breeding ground"" of terrorists.

6,"Annan asked to review policy on gay, lesbian rights","UNITED NATIONS: After a heated debate, the powerful budgetary committee of the UN General Assembly has asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to review the new policy which recognises gay and lesbian unions among staff members provided the country to which they belong also does so.

Despite strong opposition by Muslim and several African nations to the new policy, the committee did not issue any directive to Annan but allowed him to decide whether to continue the policy or make changes in it.

Annan had issued the executive directive changing policy that will allow partners of gay and lesbian couples to enjoy benefits that all married couples get. The budgetary committee came into picture as the new policy has financial implications.

Gay and lesbians, who had lobbied hard, had hailed the new directive which went into force on February 1 but the 57-member Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) strongly opposed that same sex couple get the benefit enjoyed by married couples. Several African nations supported this view.

UN officials justified the policy saying it applies only to citizens of the countries which recognise such arrangements. For example, Netherlands recognises same six marriages. Several others, including Finland, Norway, Denmark, Australia, Canada, France and Germany, recognize domestic partnerships. The US has said it is concerned that the order was ""divisive"" and urged the UN chief to reconsider.

Annan''s directive in part says: ""A legally recognized domestic partnership contracted by a staff members under the law of the country of his or her nationality will also qualify that staff member to receive the entitlements provided for eligible family members.""

Several speakers from Islamic and African countries argued that it was prerogative of member states, and not the Secretary-general, to amend the rules. They supported Egyptian view that the contribution by his country to the UN should be used to pay the benefits for something that was against its culture.

But others equally strongly argued that the Secretary General as the organisation''s chief administrative officer has the right to amend the rules. The issue, they said, was not whether members states agreed or disagreed with any particular family model or relationship but rather the need to continue the long accepted practice of determining personal status for the purpose of entitlements by reference to the law of staff members'' nationality.

Ultimately, the Committee adopted a resolution which asks the Secretary General to reissue the order, taking into account the views and concerns expressed by the member states. The language does not bind Annan to reverse or change the order and after review, he could just maintain the existing order.

7,NDA govt 'compromised' on defence: Cong,"NEW DELHI: Accusing BJP-led NDA Government of ""compromising"" on the country''s defence preparedness during its five-year rule, Congress on Saturday said it owed an explanation to the nation.

""This Government adopted a non-serious and casual attitude towards country''s defence preparedness during the last five years and it was found napping and wanting on this front,"" said party spokesman Anand Sharma.

Parliament had sanctioned Rs 27,000 crore for purchase of defence materials for Army, Air Force and Navy but this amount was allowed to be lapsed because there was no scope for any ""bungling"", he said, wanting to know from the Government as to why this amount remained unutilised.

Observing that the government ""compromised"" on the country''s defence preparedness, Sharma alleged that there were scams in defence deals.

Recalling the collection of cess amounting to Rs 4,000 crore from the public after the Kargil conflict, Sharma further alleged that the amount was ""misused"".

The report of the Subramaniyam Committee on the Kargil conflict, which contained ""shocking revelations"" was never allowed to be discussed in Parliament, he said, adding that the Government never bothered to clarify about the irregularities pointed out by the CAG and the Public Accounts Committee in the import of defence materials after the Kargil conflict.
