0,Builder arrested under MCOCA,"MUMBAI: The city crime branch has booked a builder under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

He was allegedly involved in the construction of a shopping plaza in a property, near Sara shopping centre in Crawford Market, owned by underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.

The builder, G.N. Tanwar, has been remanded to judicial custody.He is, however, admitted to MGM Hospital in Vashi.

The police were unable to arrest Tanwar for the past three months as the latter was admitted in hospital for some ailment.

The MCOCA court recently gave permission to the police to arrest the builder. Assistant commissioner crime) Shanker Kamble said the police were likely to make a few more arrests in the case in a couple of days.

Two months ago, municipal commissioner K.C. Srivastava had ordered an inquiry into the construction in the illegal property owned by Dawood.

The plot, measuring about 850 square metres, was earlier owned by the Central Ice and Cold Storage Company and was bought by Dawood henchmen in the early 1990s for a throwaway price.

The construction was stopped by the police after they arrested Iqbal Kaskar and Sara shopping centre owners Abdul Sattar and Abdul Radhanpur in March this year.

The police had then identified more than nine Dawood properties in Mumbai and the under-construction shopping plaza was one of them. The police suspect Tanwar to have links with the underworld don.

Sources said Tanwar had made an application to the civic building proposals department in 1993 to construct a shopping centre.

Civic officials delayed the permission until 1998, when the builder was allowed to go ahead with the construction.

The investigating officers are likely to interrogate assistant engineer Narendra Rajbhar, who is suspected of clearing the proposal for the shopping plaza.

Incidentally, Rajbhar is the only engineer from the BMC building proposals department to be arrested under MCOCA in the Sara case. He was granted bail by the special court recently.

The plot, according to the police, actually belongs to the railways. The crime branch has even written a letter to the railway authorities in this connection. However, senior railway officials denied that it was their plot.

3,Assam bandh hits life,"GUWAHATI: A 48-hour general strike called by insurgent outfits Ulfa, NDFB and KLO to protest military operations against them in Bhutan began in Assam on Saturday morning amidst tight security, partially affecting normal life in the state.

Though most of the educational institutions were closed here and in other parts of the state, offices remained open.

However, people had difficulty reaching their work places due to skeleton public transport service. Long-distance trains and air services operated but long-distance buses plied with police escort.

Shops and markets remained closed in the first few hours of the bandh, which began at 5 am, but started opening as people came out of their houses for their daily needs.

The strike has been called in the state and adjoining north Bengal areas by the militant outfits also to protest death of Ulfa political advisor Bhimakanta Buragohain in the military operations.

Security, tightened in the state following the operations in Bhutan to flush out militants, was further intensified, specially around vital installations, railway tracks and sensitive areas, police said.

4,Mumbai rally Priyanka's political debut?,"MUMBAI: Will Sonia Gandhi''s rally at Shivaji Park here on December 27 be used to launch her daughter Priyanka into politics? This is the question being asked in Congress circles here.

Member of the Congress Working Committee and senior party leader Shivraj Patil stated here on Saturday that Priyanka was ""among the important leaders"" invited by Mumbai Regional Congress Committee president Gurudas Kamat for the rally.

The public meeting is being seen in political circles here as the virtual start of the Congress campaign for the Lok Sabha elections.

Kamat said that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in his speech to the BJP parliamentary party at the start of the winter session of the Lok Sabha, gave strong indications that the polls would be held in March-April, 2004.

Instead of being caught off-guard, the Congress is beginning its preparations in earnest. Initially it was felt that the rally should not be organised in view of the defeat of the party in the recent assembly polls in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

However, AICC general secretary Vayalar Ravi and others felt that the party should not allow itself to be gripped by a defeatist attitude and instead it should start preparing for the general elections. Hence, the decision to go ahead with the rally.

The million-dollar-question is whether Priyanka will be formally inducted and asked to help her mother in the campaign. Many Congressmen in Maharashtra are of the opinion that Priyanka would be able to capture the imagination of young voters.

""We should be able to offer something new to the people and what better way of doing that than projecting Priyanka on New Year''s eve?"" a Congress activist asked.

There is also speculation that Sonia Gandhi does not want a parallel centre of power within the party. But she may revise her attitude in view of the poor position of the party in most states.

5,"Talks between angry doctors, govt fail","HYDERABAD: Talks between the striking medicos and the government on Saturday failed as both the parties stuck to their guns.

They have, however, agreed to have one more round of talks on Monday to resolve the issue.

Health minister Kodela Sivaprasada Rao informed representatives of the AP Junior Doctorsâ€™ association (which is heading the strike) during the talks that the medical students had no right to question the policy matters of the government, according to sources.

â€œSetting up of private medical colleges in the state would produce a glut of qualified doctors, which would help increase the medical reach to the common man. They could also go to foreign countries (where demand for the qualified doctors is high) for employment opportunities,â€™â€™ the minister told the striking doctors.

â€œThe students could not demand the scrapping of GO Ms 90, handing over of medical institutions to the developmental societies, setting up of private medical colleges and collection of user charges in the government hospitals,â€™â€™ the minister categorically told the association representatives.

Rao assured the medicos that the government would scrap three per cent of self financing seats in the government medical colleges besides reducing the 25 per cent self financing seats in the Post graduate colleges, the sources said.

The minister also reportedly told the doctors that the methods of agitation resorted to by them, would demean the profession and asked them to prove the corruption charges against the government.

Over 15 representatives from the association went for the talks, but only three of them talked to the minister.

The association representatives informed the minister that they would not call off the strike unless the government heed to their demands.

The striking medicos have even threatened the government that they would boycott emergency duties if the talks fail on Monday.

Principal secretary (health) S Bhale Rao, director general health services Anji Reddy and others officials took part in the talks.

6,Modi's development mode greeted with yawn,"PHAGVEL, Kheda: When Chief Minister Narendra Modi climbed on to the stage to the accompaniment of signature tune of Sanjay Khanâ€™s popular teleserial â€˜The Sword of Tipu Sultanâ€™ that was being played on loudspeakers and brandished the sword presented to him, the crowd thought the quintessential Modi was back.

However, the sizeable crowd that had gathered at Phagvel to see the champion of Hindutva inaugurate the â€˜Siddhi Yatraâ€™ was in for a disappointment. It was an uncharacteristic speech about development sprinkled with attacks on Congress, religious conversions, â€˜five starâ€™ activists and the media â€” he criticised newspapers for over half-adozen times in his hour-long speech.

And, going by the public reaction, it seemed Modiâ€™s developmental talk, interspersed with attacks on his favourite punching bags, did not create even a semblance of the magic that was evident when the man had launched the Gaurav Yatra a year ago at the same venue. Modi returned to Phagvel, the Kshatriya-dominated village in Central Gujarat, to celebrate one year of his rule and tell people the achievements of his â€˜asardar sarkarâ€™ (effective government).

â€œLast year when I decided to come here to seek blessings of Bhathiji Maharaj (a saint who had sacrificed his life while fighting to protect cows), some people decided to imitate me,â€� said Modi, hinting at GPCC chief Shankersinh Vaghela. â€œBut after the mandate we got with the blessings of Bhathiji Maharaj, they must have started looking for some other place for blessings,â€� he said.

Before Modi began his speech, state BJP chief Rajendrasinh Rana had made it clear that the biggest siddhi (achievement) of the Modi government was returning the â€˜lost prideâ€™ to the state and that development does not mean roads, infrastructure and monetary gains.

Drawing a comparison with Bhathiji Maharaj, Modi said that he and his government were committed to following the path of the famous saint. â€œBhathiji fought for the Hindu religion with a sword. We have done so by formulating the Freedom of Religion Act. We have checked the elements threatening our religion by formulating this Act,â€� he said.

7,"'Rs 16,000-cr investment in infrastructure'","VADODARA: Committed investment proposals of up to Rs 16,000 crore have come in, till October, mainly in development of infrastructure like roads, ports and Special Economic Zones (SEZ), technology parks, educational projects and gas network.

This was announced by industry and mines minister Anil Patel here on Saturday. He was here for the ''Siddhi Yatra'' which will see several other ministers visiting industrial hubs in the state. The government plans to invest Rs 1 lakh crore in five years, mainly to develop infrastructure.

Out of this, a significant portion would be spent on SEZs like Dahej and Mundra ports. The Centre has given them SEZ status. A new four-lane highway between Bharuch and Dahej has also been finalised, he said. The minister, however, could not quantify the number of MoUs and the Expression of Interest (EoI) signed of the Rs 66,000 crore worth of investments the government had expected.

Patel expressed though the figures in terms of the number of projects in various sectors which constituted the corpus investment. Eight MoUs were signed in the chemicals and pharma sector worth Rs 12,000 crore, at least six MoUs were signed in the oil and gas sector worth Rs 6,400 crore, textiles had five MoUs worth Rs 6,000 crore.

Engineering and technology sector involves five projects worth Rs 3,000 crore and educational projects, however, constitute Rs 300 crore. The bio-technology park at Savli near here, he said, would be ready by June. It can boast of a common research facility to be developed in phases. It will have the latest equipment to cater to segments like industry, agriculture, bio-infomatics and pharma of the bio-tech sector.

Asked if the government was trying to attract investment for the automobile sector at Halol where General Motors (GM) has already set-up a plant, Patel said, ""BMW had approached us and we are still negotiating with them. We have also approached the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) to attract more investments in this sector."" Another focus sector on the minister''s agenda was the shrinking smallscale industry. Both handicrafts and those involved in producing intermediates for industries will be given government support, he said.

â€œWe have divided almost 2.5 lakh SSIs in the state into small clusters and have designed specific programmes that could provide them an extra boost.We have tied up with institutions like NID and NIFT and have handed them over 16 handicrafts clusters with a primary investment of Rs 2.5 crore. We will also invest Rs 4 crore on the leather cluster and will spend Rs 13 crore in setting up concepts like ''urban'' and ''highway'' haats. One urban haat will come up near Kheda soon.â€�

8,Naroda case accused arrested for dacoity,"AHMEDABAD: A Naroda Patia massacre accused, who is out on bail, has been nabbed once again â€” this time for being a dacoit! Harshad Chhara (24), along with six accomplices, was caught by the railway police late Thursday, as he tried to rob employees of a courier service company (angadias) carrying diamonds and jewellery at the Kalupur railway station.

Chhara, arrested earlier for his involvement in the Naroda Patia carnage that left 86 dead, was released on bail in July. Police said the dacoity bid was not a one-off affair. Chharaâ€™s gang was well organised and operated all across the country. So much so that the gang members would fly by airlines to different parts of the country then board trains and rob passengers.

This is not all, at the airport and on flight they would resort to pickpocketing. Chhara,at the time of arrest, had six criminal offences, including murder, robbery and theft, against him. The six others arrested in this case are: Ravi Garge (35), Nitin Chhara (26), Kishan Chhara (25),Vishal Chhara (25),Jayesh Chhara (20) and Manoj Kanhaiyalal (20).

The police have seized three knives and mobile phones from the accused. Police said they were trying to ascertaining whether this gang was involved in robbing nine employees of a courier service of diamonds, gold, silver and cash worth Rs 90 lakh late last year.

Analysts point out that the arrest of Harshad Chhara glaringly illustrated the kind of persons who had participated in the communal carnage. This flies in the face of the contention made by some that the carnage was a result of the popular anger against the Godhra train burning, said an analyst.

9,Dissidents get together at dinner hosted by 2 ministers,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress dissidents gathered here over dinner hosted jointly by minister of higher education Harnam Dass Johar and minister of technical education Mohinder Singh Kaypee at Chandigarh Club, close to the CM residence.

However, both had different reasons for inviting their colleagues on Saturday evening. While Kaypee had returned after a short visit to United Kingdom, Johar wanted to celebrate his birthday. Interestingly, according to official records Johar was born on October 31, 1934.

Senior cabinet minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal denied that it had anything to do with dissidence.

""It''s a social function and nothing more should be read in it,"" she quipped. The dinner was to signal the return of dissidents back to Chandigarh after having camped in Delhi for over 12 days. Also, it was to show their solidarity. Most of the prominent dissidents attended the dinner but for Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder.

Bhinder opted out as she is Delhi-based and her presence at dinner would send a ''wrong'' signal to the party high command that dissidents were ganging up again, sources said adding her entire group was intact and was present in full strength.

Bhattal said they would be back to work and all ministers would attend their offices on Monday. Apparently, the crisis in the Congress legislative party (CLP) was over but the under currents suggest that normalcy would be restored only after Amarinder Singh''s removal as chief minister.

On their resolve to change the CLP leadership, Bhattal said the party president was in the know of things and she would take the decision in the best interests of the party.

""We would all abide by her decision,"" she said. The decision on the party leadership would be taken after the winter session of the parliament.

10,BJP's mission to highlight Congress govt's failure,"FEROZEPUR: In order to widen its base in the rural areas of the state, the Punjab unit of BJP has conceived a special programme â€˜Mission-2004â€™ under which a special drive would be launched to highlight the achievements of the BJP-led Central government and the failures of the Congress government in the state.

This was stated by Avinash Rai Khanna, state BJP president, here on Friday night. Addressing mediapersons at the residence of Sukhpal Singh Nannu, local BJP MLA, after presiding over a meeting of BJP workers and leaders of the district, Khanna said a sense of uncertainty was prevailing in the state due to the ongoing tussle for power between chief minister Amarinder Singh and the Congress dissidents.

He said that his party had already met the governor and demanded a special assembly session as â€˜Amarinder Singh has lost the moral responsibility to run the governmentâ€™.

Khanna said that the charges of corruption levelled by one senior Congress minister against Amarinder Singh should be probed by the CBI.

He said to gear up the party rank and file for the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, organisational restructuring was underway and the whole process would be completed shortly.

Giving details of the newly-designated observers in the state, he said Rajya Sabha member Bibi Gurcharan Kaur would be responsible for Bathinda and Muktsar district, Chaudhary Swarana Ram for Jalandhar rural and Nawan Shahar. Luxmi Kanta Chawla for Batala and Amritsar rural, Shakti Sharma for Kapurthala, Avinaash Jaiswal for Patiala rural, Vinod Sharma for Ludhiana urban and Gurdaspur, Arunesh Saker for Amritsar urban, Chiranaji Lal Bajaj for Abohar and Faridkot.

11,Display of loyalty dominates Cong 'vikas rally',"JALANDHAR: At his the first public rally after the â€˜â€˜truceâ€™â€™ with dissident, chief minister Amarinder Singh switched over to development mode and introduced the idiom â€˜â€˜of information technology, modernised education and a fresh phase of industrialisation in Punjabâ€™â€™ here on Saturday.

Not once did he refer to the trouble with the dissidents even though they were all absent from a party rally held here. All the five names mentioned in the invitation card for the â€˜â€˜Vikas Rallyâ€™â€™ did not attend the meeting and the loyalists made oblique references to the dissidents in their speeches and assured Amarinder Singh repeatedly that they stood by him firmly.

In the end, it turned into an exercise in eulogising the chief minister. While the front row was made to look crowded with ex-ministers, officials and mayors, the back row was also peopled with political stand-byes.

The absence of those from the dissident camp was indicative of the continued split in the state Congress. Even the five prominent dissident names that found a place on the invitation card were absent. The absentees were: Kanwaljit Singh Lally, Gurwinder Singh Atwal, Gurkanwal Kaur, Mohinder Kaypee (minister), Jagmohan Kang (minister). They are all known to have been part of the dissident group headed by Rajinder Kaur Bhatthal.

Instead of â€˜â€˜Vikasâ€™â€™, the theme followed at the rally was loyalty, eulogies for the CMâ€™s anti-corruption drive.

Interestingly, a lot of time was spent on naming almost everyone on the stage. State Congress president HS Hanspal even announced that the chief minister would be now be accessible to the people. Apparently, earlier he wasnâ€™t. â€˜â€˜He would be meeting people at the PPCC office every Thursday,â€™â€™ Hanspal said.

Amarjit Singh Samra, state minister for revenue and agriculture said: â€˜â€˜If Amarinder Singh canâ€™t help the Congress win the parliamentary elections, who else can?â€™â€™ He clearly was on the defensive. Avtar Henry, minister, referred to the CM as â€˜â€˜scholarly, intelligent and a harbinger of modernisationâ€™â€™.

HS Hanspal, making a reference to the dissident trouble, said â€˜â€˜jithey chaar shreer rehande ne uthay bhande taan kharkange.â€™â€™

As if showing an underlying insecurity, he named two sitting MPs Balbir Singh and Santosh Chowdhry as the candidates for the coming Lok Sabha polls.

12,Forum's orders on Huda CA's arrest set aside,"CHANDIGARH: The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRM) on Saturday set aside the orders of Rohtak Consumer Forum concerning imprisonment for Haryana Urban development authority (Huda) chief administrator N C Wadhwa.

A two-member bench of presiding member Banarsi Dass and Shakuntala Yadev gave the order while disposing of the revision petition filed by Wadhwa. The Rohtak forum had ordered four-year imprisonment for Wadhwa and a fine of Rs 80,000 while deciding on eight complaints in November.

Claiming that the order was arbitrary, issued against the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and beyond the jurisdiction of the Rohtak forum, Huda CA, in his petition, had said that he was not even impleaded as party in the original complaints. Besides this, he was not given an opportunity to appear in the court.

The revision petition was moved in the last week of November and the state commission had stayed implementation of orders of the Rohtak forum.

Representatives of all the eight complainants opposed Wadhwaâ€™s revision petition.

The commission, upholding the Wadhwaâ€™s plea, disposed of the revision petition.

13,N Railway to increase security in yards,"NEW DELHI: The Northern Railway is going to increase the security of railway coaches and yards seeing the recent incident of fire in empty coaches. The authorities are suspecting the hand of an organised gang behind these incidents.

The railway police will increase the security of washing yards and empty coaches. A Northern Railway spokesperson said: ""We have conducted an inquiry to see if we were at fault or if there were technical faults. But we haven''t found anything yet.""

These fire incidents have been increasing over the past few months. The police is investigating the cases and will also start a drive to cleanse the yards and the railway stations of unwanted elements. ""The yards are very dark and dingy. They are sometimes home to drug peddlers, road-side vendors and even petty thieves,"" said the official. There are four major yards at Old Delhi station, New Delhi railway station, Sarai Rohilla and Nizamuddin station.

14,Amartya stresses close link between law and economics,"KOLKATA: Though an interdisciplinary approach between economics and law is now popular in the West, it is still at a nascent stage in India.

There are three institutes in the country where this is done â€” one of them is West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences. Amartya Sen was all praise for NUJS on Saturday, while giving the first lecture on the law-economics interface.

Sen inaugurated the Keshav Chandra Basu Endowment Lecture Series in Law and Economics in the university. Kaushik Basu, professor of international studies and economics at Cornell University, created the series in memory of his father.

Explaining the relation between the two disciplines, Sen said: â€œEconomic operations do not occur in a legal vacuum â€” they are governed by legal arrangements, legal rights and legal duties.â€�

Even basic economic concepts such as ownership and endowment are law-related. Going on to explain social justice, Sen said during a tour of primary health centres in rural Bengal and Jharkhand, he found doctors working so hard in a few of the PHCs that they did not have any time to talk with him. And in some, there were hardly any patients and doctors had all the time in the world. â€œHow can people forget duties towards the Constitution.

Why are external agencies required to remind them of their duties?â€� While explaining the breakdown of social justice he reminded people of the Godhra incident. â€œCriminals go scot-free while law abiding citizens are put in jails though the country has set itself a high economic goal!â€�

On the same note he drew audience attention to the Supreme Court judgment that every child has the right to school education and clean wholesome midday meal at school as these are the basic tenets of development.

Both economics and law should, however, be complementary and inter-dependence between the disciplines is needed.

15,"Stamp scam: Cop held, minister's kin surrenders","NEW DELHI: Twenty-two months after a property-dealer complained to the police about the association of an inspector with the kingpin of the stamp paper scam, Abdul Karim Telgi, the Delhi police finally arrested the policeman.

The crime branch, on Friday, arrested Inspector Puran Singh from his residence. Singh is posted with the Delhi armed police.

He was earlier with south district police and also served as in-charge of the Nehru Place police post.

The police have recovered 30 air tickets from his house. These include tickets of Mumbai and Bangalore-bound flights. Telgi is lodged in Bangalore jail.

Deputy commissioner of police (economic offence wing) Dinesh Bhatt said: ""Singh protected Telgi by not arresting him in two cases which were registered in Defence Colony and Kalkaji.""

Singh has been sent to police custody for four days after the police advocate Vipin Sanduja told the court that the inspector had arranged sureties for Telgi''s associates, who were arrested in Delhi two years ago.

Singh''s name emerged after the crime branch arrested two property-dealers who had allegedly helped Telgi hire premises in Delhi for his business.

The police claimed that Sushant Kumar Das and Lalit Kumar Patodi worked for the kingpin despite having knowledge of his ""illegal activities.""

Patodi, however, blew the lid when he said that he had filed a complaint with the Connaught Place police station in February last year. He claimed Telgi and his Mumbai-based henchmen had threatened him when he wanted to blow the whistle on the stamp scam.

Patodi also mentioned Singh''s role in detail. The police, however, did not take the complaint seriously and did not bother to verify the inspector''s role.

16,I&B ministry rules out review of CAS,"NEW DELHI: The Information and Broadcasting Ministry on Sunday night said that no decision had been taken to review implementation of the Conditional Access System (CAS) in South Delhi.

""There is no review of CAS as of today,"" Information and Broadcasting Secretary Pawan Chopra said here when asked about reports that government would review CAS if it was not satisfied with its implementation in South Delhi.

He said that the government was pressurising the cable industry to make the system more consumer-friendly.

While Chopra declined to make further comments on the issue, official sources said that the infighting between multi-system operators, especially Hathway (partly owned by Star) and Siti (a Zee group arm), could put the entire process of CAS implementation in Delhi in jeopardy.

""The problem is less political. It mainly stems from infighting among multi-system operators, particularly between Hathway and Siti. If this continues, CAS implementation can be in serious trouble,"" they said.

Officials of Hathway and Siti could not be reached for comments.
