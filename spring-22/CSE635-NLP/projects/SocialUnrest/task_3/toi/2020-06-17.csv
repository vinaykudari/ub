0,Cong gears up for Assembly elections,"NEW DELHI: Flyovers in Delhi, infrastructure in Chhattisgarh, Dalit upliftment in Madhya Pradesh and development in Rajasthan coupled with a list of scams and ""anti-farmer"" policies of the Union government are the Congress'' campaign highlights for the assembly elections in the next six months.

Congress is upbeat about these assembly elections that are expected to set the mood and prepare the time-table for the next general elections. Nevertheless, preparations are on at the AICC level here with chief ministers and party bosses being called to the head quarters to decide on the broad campaign strategy.

The first such election strategy committee chaired by Manmohan Singh met on Saturday to make a preliminary assessment and to activate the election machinery in the states.

Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram were discussed with the respective chief ministers and party presidents and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh would be taken up on Sunday.

In all the Congress-ruled states, the CMs would lead the campaign and in fact, the stability of chief ministers as opposed to the BJP frequently changing its former Delhi CMs, would be a campaign plank. So far, there has been no talk of any alliances except may be in Mizoram.

Though the Congress admits certain amount of infighting in the Delhi unit, it claims the infighting in the BJP as its biggest advantage. Also to contain the infighting some changes are expected to be made at the organisational level.

The AICC general secretary Ambika Soni said, ""Our governments are going to speak about achievements that they are proud of. For instance in Delhi, the CNG buses, the flyovers, better water and electricity supply and lesser pollution than when we came into power, all these would be focussed. Along with this we would number the anti-people, anti-farmer policies that we forced the government to change, like urea prices, powerloom sector problems, telephone tariff.""

The Congress seems to be equally confident about Chhattisgarh because of ""the lack of leadership in the BJP there"".

In fact, the only major controversy there is the one created by chief minister Ajit Jogi himself. The CM was reluctant to discuss with the media the issue of CBI asking him time to probe the letter that he distributed over a month ago.

Soni said that the alleged intelligence bureau letter about Jogi''s assets did not figure in the campaign strategy meeting and that, Jogi was confident that the former Congress leader VC Shukla who joined the NCP is no longer a factor in the state politics. Former Mizoram CM and party chief Lalthenhawla participated in the meeting on Mizoram.

1,Tutored witnesses turn riot inquiry into sham,"VADODARA: Can victims of communal violence in Gujarat speak freely about police complicity with the mobs if they are made to depose before a dozen gun-toting police officials? Besides, how can they level serious charges against policemen when the men in khaki themselves have hand-picked them to depose before a judicial inquiry commission? These are the questions bothering both riot victims and activists who came to depose before the Justice GT Nanavati and Justice KG Shah Commission on Tuesday.

For the second day running, nearly all the witnesses told the commission they were satisfied with the role of the police. However, in private, residents from Panigate and Macchipeeth told TNN that constables from the local police station had come to their homes in the morning and ordered them to first congregate at the police headquarters. There, officials first gave them a list of dos and donâ€™ts and only then allowed to depose before the commission.

â€œI said that the police protected us during the riots because that is what they asked me to say,â€� says Nizam Khan Pathan, a resident of Raja Rani Talav, Panigate. â€œThey had told us the day before to first collect at the police commissionerate and only then speak before the commission.â€�

Even as reporters were speaking to the witness after he had deposed, a nosey policeman in mufti started hovering around and was identified by the witness. He turned out to be constable Dharmendra Rana from Panigate police station. The two judges began their hearings in the conference room of the Vadodara Circuit House.

They sat at the head of the U-shaped table and were flanked on both sides by IPS officers, police inspectors and sub-inspectors. Among those present during the hearings on Tuesday afternoon were Ahmedabad joint commissioner of police P C Thakur, who was then the joint CP of Vadodara, assistant commissioner of police S M Katara, deputy superintendent of police of Vadodara (rural) D N Patel, police inspectors J D Jhala, B I Patel,V D Rathore and V M Chauhan and others.

District collector Bhagyesh Jha and former police commissioner of Vadodara D D Tuteja,who has now retired,were also in the room. Riot victims were asked to sit in the middle of this â€˜Uâ€™ of officials looking at them in the eye, and tell the two judges what they thought about the role of the police. Expectedly, all the witnesses had accolades for the men in khaki. According to most of the depositions, the police always reached on time, they always helped the two communities maintain peace and did not allow â€œmiscreantsâ€� from spreading violence.

Only after one of the witnesses said he was afraid to speak in the presence of the officials, were some of them asked to leave. Those officials responsible for the area where the incident took place were allowed to sit in the hearing. Even Gani Kureshi, former chairman of the Gujarat Minorities Finance Corporation, who was present at the hearing conceded that the presence of the police officials was intimidating.

â€œLet me see if I can convince the judges to conduct the hearings without the police officials,â€� he said. Asked to comment on the hearings, Vadodara police commissioner Sudhir Sinha said, â€œPUCL did represent about witnesses being threatened by policemen but were not able to provide specific instances. This is a serious allegation. Show me one instance and I will take stern actionâ€�.

3,Five farmers released,"BATHINDA: Giving in to the pressure tactics of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU-Ekta), which had detained Primary Agriculture Development Bank (PADB) manager on Monday till late evening, the Bathinda district administration released five farmers from the central jail here on Tuesday.

The farmers were arrested for not returning the loan amount.

The BKU activists were sitting on a dharna in front of PADB, Nathana, for the last four days, demanding the release of the farmers.

The BKU activists had blocked traffic on Nathana-Bucho Mandi road and had detained the bank staff in the building for the entire day on Monday. While junior bank officials were released in the evening, the BKU activists refused to release bank manager Amolak Singh.

Heavy police force, fire tenders and police commandos assembled at Nathana to deal with the agitation. But keeping in view the forthcoming panchayat elections, the higher authorities in Chandigarh had reportedly asked the district administration to find out a peaceful solution.

At about 10.15 pm on Monday, Bathindaâ€™s additional deputy commissioner KP Brar had reached Nathana and on her assurance that their demand would be met, the BKU activists agreed to release the manager. They had, however, declined to lift the dharna until the arrested farmers joined them.

The released farmers included Malkeet Singh of Maisarkhana, Karam Singh of Jai Singh Wala, Nachhatar Singh of Mehta,Kuljinder Singh of Birk Khurd and Malkeet Singh of Masana.

4,"Full protection to riot victims, witnesses: Gujarat Govt","NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday said the Gujarat government has assured it that appropriate measures have been taken to provide protection to the witnesses and victims deposing in the courts and before the Justice Nanavati commission of inquiry probing last year''s communal violence.

Commission sources said: ``The NHRC''s order (to provide protection) assumes importance in the backdrop of reports of a boycott of the commission by some persons and organisations after Justice Nanawati reportedly made a remark that no evidence has been found of the VHP''s complicity in last year''s violence.''''

Immediately after Nanavati''s remark was reported, the NHRC had asked the Gujarat director-general of police whether any measures had been taken to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses who have to depose either in court or before the inquiry commission.

The commission noted on Tuesday: ``The DGP has assured the NHRC that protection would be given to witnesses and victims. Necessary instructions have been issued to all the superintendents and commissioners of police to ensure that due protection is given immediately whenever any witness or victim requests for the same or expresses apprehension about his or her safety.''''

The NHRC also hoped that witnesses/victims would appear before the trial courts or the inquiry commission and make their statements without any fear or favour. In case there is police inaction on their request, the NHRC said, the witnesses may bring the matter to the notice of the special rapporteur of NHRC, P G J Nampoothiri, who will take up the matter with state DGP.

5,1 lakh govt employees for panchayat polls,"HOSHIARPUR: As many as 15,000 polling booths have been set-up for the upcoming panchayat elections in 12,500 villages in the state.

Stating this here on Tuesday, Punjab state election commissioner CL Bains said nearly one lakh government employees, except those from the rural development department, had been put on poll duty.

He said three significant reforms were added to ensure transparency in the elections.

These included that candidates filing nomination for election to the sarpach post would now have to add information about their assets and educational qualifications in a separate column, besides the usual declaration that no criminal case was registered against them.

He said Punjab was the third state to adopt this practice after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.

Bains said earlier there was a returning officer (RO) for one block, but in this election there would be a RO for every 15 villages. He added that to stop the malpractice of rejecting nomination forms on the pretext of being incomplete, the RO would give back a photocopy of the form along with an annexure stating that it was complete at the time of filing it.

6,Samajwadi Party workers booked for rioting,"GHAZIABAD: A report of rioting, damaging public property and attacking public servants on duty has been filed against five office bearers and 80 activists of the women''s wing of the Samajwadi Party (SP) by Ghaziabad''s deputy municipal commissioner P S Dubey.

The Samajwadi Party activists had on Monday charged into the Town Hall, carrying empty pots and demanding proper water supply.

They were shouting slogans, smashing the pots and allegedly damaging civic property.

Only five office bearers were named in the report. Sihani Gate police officials declined to reveal their names.

Police officials said the women were also carrying sticks and had allegedly forced their way into the office of the municipal commissione. The official was not present there at that point of time.

When deputy municipal commissioner P S Dubey tried to reason with the angry women, they allegedly smeared his face with ink.

The police said Dubey''s report claimed the women smashed some pots on the municipal commissioner''s table and tried to attack civic officials.

Some public property was also damaged by the rioting women. Police said attempts were being made to arrest the accused.

7,Voluntary sector policy on drawing board,"NEW DELHI: The Planning Commission hopes to have, within two months, a national policy on the voluntary sector and perhaps make specific 10th Plan targets the nucleus of an action programme.

Planning Commission chief K C Pant announced this Wednesday, after the ``joint machinery'''' comprising representatives from the voluntary sector and officials met for the first time after its reconstitution in January this year.

On this panel, chaired by Pant, are voluntary sector veterans such as Ela Bhatt, Mohan Dharia and Chandi Prasad Bhatt as well as the director-general of CAPART and secretaries of various ministries.

Ultimately, said Pant, states will have to be on board and even problems at the district level may have to be taken into account since many agencies work at the village or district level. In fact, one point made was that though problems are growing in cities, the voluntary movement isn''t as strong there.

The other areas of weakness are the North-east and Jammu and Kashmir. Two workshops are planned for these areas to begin the process of strengthening the voluntary sector and building capability.

Looking at issues ranging from the relationship between government agencies and voluntary organisations to the credibility and accountability of such bodies and the development of ``professionalism'''', Pant said almost everybody supported the plan on framing a national policy, building on earlier attempts. A Planning Commission draft will be circulated within 45 days; members will get 15 days to send in comments.

Raising a ``general point'''' on whether there should be a focus and prioritisation for voluntary agencies, Pant said the commission''s view was that the 11 monitorable targets set in the 10th Plan could be the nucleus. These cover issues raning from poverty, literacy and employment to drinking water and the environment.

The Commission''s view is that the entire system for this sector, including state, domestic and foreign institutional donors, could be mobilised to provide support to specific areas. Pant hastened to add this was not an attempt to ``restrict'''' activities.

With numerous small organisations now having come up, the need for professionalism and skills was discussed. For instance, said Pant, the science and technology departments would like to use voluntary agencies for extension work but not unless ``basic competence'''' is on tap. Among the ideas thrown up on this front were the concept of `mother NGOs'' and training institutions.

8,Badal relatives' arrest points to ill-intention: Tandon,"CHANDIGARH: Veteran BJP leader and former minister Balramji Dass Tandon said if opposition leader Parkash Singh Badal was arrested, people would come together and protest against the state governmentâ€™s misadventure.

In a statement issued here on Tuesday, Tandon said the arrest and torture of Badalâ€™s relatives and family members points to the ill-intentions of the government, who want to extract statements against Badal under pressure and then pave way for his arrest.

The BJP leader also condemned the arrest of five senior executives of a commercial organisation in Delhi.

He said whisking them away to Punjab without supplying them with a authentic copy of a FIR or producing them before â€˜ilaqaâ€™ magistrate was illegal.

Tandon said Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had failed to even specifically name Badalâ€™s properties worth Rs 3,500 crore, which he had been pointing to for the last one and half years.

He accused Amarinder of taking the political animosity to such a pitch of threatening to arrest the opposition leader. He said this was not desirable in a sensitive border state, adjoining neighbours like Pakistan.

Tandon also attributed the sudden flurry in the police and the vigilance bureau (VB) to Amarinderâ€™s nervousness in the wake of Akali unity. He alleged that to divert the attention of people from the governmentâ€™s failure, Amarinder had selected the path of confrontation.

The BJP leader said the government had failed on all fronts and had burdened the people with taxes. â€˜â€˜People have to pay more for electricity, water and sewerage facilities, petrol and tuition fee,â€™â€™ he said.

10,Four arrested in Rohini rape case,"NEW DELHI: The police have arrested four people for allegedly raping a 15-year-old in Sultanpuri. Roshan Kundu (35), the main accused used to impersonate a policeman.

Kundu and another accused Ramesh Singhal (44) belong to Kaithal in Haryana. The other two accused, Ram Sevak Gupta and Surender Singh, are residents of Bihar and Uttaranchal respectively. Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Sanjay Singh said, ""Kundu had been arrested earlier as well for posing as a policeman and harassing people.""

Joint commissioner of police (northern range) Ranjit Narayan said: ""The police zeroed in on three accused with the help of portraits prepared with the help of the victim and her uncle.

The beat constables in the Prashant Vihar area identified one of the portraits which helped police nab Singhal, who is a shopkeeper in Rohini."" The girl helped the police prepare the sketch of the accused.

Singhal broke down during interrogation and revealed that he had met Kundu alongwith the victim and her uncle near the Naharpur bus stand on the fateful day. After the disclosure, police raided Kunduâ€™s residence in Haryana at 3 am on Tuesday and arrested the main accused. Kundu, police said, admitted to the crime and helped police arrest Gupta and Singh from Rohini and Jahangirpuri respectively.

The police said that Kundu and Singh had intercepted the girl and her uncle when they were on their way to Mongolpuri. Kundu allegedly posed as a police officer and took the girl and her uncle to police lines at Pitampura. The police said that Kundu also tried to extort money from the victimâ€™s uncle, Hotam.

The police further said that after asking Hotam to wait at the entrance of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital, Kundu took the girl to the Rohini Japanese Park where he was joined by Gupta.

The two then took the girl to a park near sector 24 in Rohini and raped her, said the police.

12,VB arrests sarpanch,"LUDHIANA: The vigilance bureau (VB) arrested Tirath Singh, sarpanch of Sihala village, from his residence near Samrala on Monday night.

Akali leaders allege that this was yet another stunt pulled off by the vigilance sleuths to put Akalis behind bars before the panchayat elections.

Inder Iqbal Singh Atwal, MLA, Kumkalan constituency, said that Tirath Singh was an influential man who had a huge following in at least dozen neighbouring villages. He alleged he could tilt the balance for Congress.

On the other hand, the SP, vigilance, said that they had detected embezzlement of Rs 85,000 in the school funds of Sihala village.

He alleged that Tirath Singh and two other teachers had bungled the school funds.

Atwal, on the other hand, said that he had found out about the probe by the education department which, he said, had been completed and the report had also been submitted.

He alleged that he saw no reason for the vigilance department to interfere into the matter just before the panchayat elections.

17,"Atal will lead BJP to polls, says Mahajan","MUMBAI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has won another round in the power struggle against the hardliners in the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Addressing reporters before the start of the crucial four-day â€˜chintan baithakâ€™ (think-tank meeting) at the pro-RSS Rambhau Mhalgi Prabhodiniâ€™s research and training centre at Uttan near Bhayandar on Tuesday, party general secretary Pramod Mahajan reiterated that the BJP would contest elections under the leadership of Mr Vajpayee who, he said, was the undisputed leader of the party and the NDA. Mr Mahajan added that deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani would only assist the PM.

Mr Mahajan, who appeared eager to avoid a controversy, said he would not like to comment on BJP president Venkaiah Naiduâ€™s recent statement that Mr Vajpayee and Mr Advani would jointly lead the party in the next elections.

Mr Naidu, who arrived here for the meeting, tactfully avoided the media and left Mr Mahajan to field all questions.

Mr Mahajan said that ever since Mr Vajpayee had assumed office in 1998, his popularity had risen and he had clearly emerged as the best choice for leadership. Hence, there was no question of any change. In fact, the question of projecting any other BJP leader did not arise, he said.

Mr Mahajan said the focus of the â€˜baithakâ€™ would be on Mission 2004 and all issues linked to it. Mission 2004 involved the formulation of a strategy and tactics to win 300 or more Lok Sabha seats for the BJP and a two-thirds majority for the NDA in next yearâ€™s parliamentary elections.

The BJP general secretary also avoided making any off-the-cuff remarks.

For example, when asked if Mr Vajpayee would be writing poetry in the scenic seaside surroundings of the venue.Mr Mahajan cryptically remarked, â€œI have no authority to speak on behalf of the Prime Minister. Moreover, you know what happens when something is said without authorisation.â€™â€™

The conclave will be formally inaugurated by Mr Vajpayee on Wednesday morning while Mr Advani will conclude it on Friday. Mr Mahajan said there would be no formal agenda or formal resolution at the conclave.

The parent body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, would be represented by veteran Madan Das Devi. Gutkha chewers CHINTAN BAITHAK

18,US court upholds law allowing secret arrests,"WASHINGTON: A US court here on Tuesday overturned a lower court order and ruled that the US government could keep secret the identity of suspects detained after the September 11 terror attacks.

Civil rights groups have protested the ruling and it is likely that the matter will be taken to the Supreme Court, Human Rights Watch said in a statement from New York.

Under Tuesday''s 2-1 decision by the Court of Appeals, the Justice Department will not have to release the names of and other information about the hundreds it arrested on immigration charges and material witness warrants in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks.

Plaintiffs, including Human Rights Watch, sought release of their names under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The court ruled that all of the information sought was statutorily exempt from disclosure because it was information compiled for law enforcement purposes, and disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.

The court said the government was entitled to withhold the dates and locations of the arrest, detention and release of all detainees, including those charged with federal crimes, as well as the names of counsel for detainees.

Hundreds of people, mainly Muslims, were arrested and held following the attacks on September 11, 2001.

Most of those held were detained under immigration regulations.

21,Surat police in Mumbai to arrest Shilpa's father,"AHMEDABAD: A five-member team of Surat police, which left for Mumbai on Wednesday to arrest Surendra Shetty, father of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty in a case of alleged extortion, drew a blank as he was not traceable at his residence or factory.

Police sources said the team left for Mumbai after Surendra withdrew his anticipatory bail application in Gujarat high court on Wednesday. The court allowed him to surrender on or before June 20.

Shetty''s advocate assured the Gujarat High Court that his client would surrender either before the Umra police or Surat commissioner on or before June 20.

The police team headed by sub-inspector Z A Sheikh raided some places to locate Shetty but he was not found. The places included his Versova residence, factory in Kalyan and his brother''s residence in the suburbs.

The team has so far been unable to locate Shetty as yet, a team member told reporters on telephone from Mumbai.

Meanwhile, the bail plea of Sunanda Shetty, mother of the actress, would be heard by a Magistrate in Surat on Thursday.

Umra police in Surat has registered a case against Surendra, Sunanda and two gangsters including Malaysia-based Fazlu Rehman for allegedly extorting money from the owner of Praful Sarees Pankaj Agarwal to recover Rs 80 lakh payable to Shilpa for modeling for an Ad film. Police also claim to have recorded telephonic conversations between Shilpa''s parents with Agarwal which indicate that the latter was threatened.

A Surat court had earlier rejected Surendra''s bail petition on the grounds that police had prima facie evidence regarding his alleged involvement in the crime.

22,India increases tally at Cannes to three golds,"CANNES: Indiaâ€™s set the ad world on fire. Ogilvy & Mather India has bagged a Gold and a Bronze Lion in the Lions Direct category, taking the total metal tally to three golds, two silvers and one bronze in what seems like a watershed year for India at the 50th Cannes Advertising Festival.

On Tuesday, in what is becoming something of a trend after Piyush Pandeyâ€™s two-gold haul last year, India began by bagging two Gold and two Silver Lions in the press and poster categories, its best performance ever at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Creative powerhouse Ogilvy & Mather romped home with a Gold Lion for its â€˜Cancer Cures Smokingâ€™ outdoor ad, and two silvers for â€˜Asteriskâ€™ (for both the outdoor and press categories), all of them for their award-winning client, Cancer Patients Aid Association.

McCann-Ericksonâ€™s national creative director Prasoon Joshi opened his account at Cannes with a bang. Akshaye Kapnadak and Joshiâ€™s ads for Coca-Cola â€˜Man In The Shadeâ€™ and â€˜Barber Shopâ€™ have bagged a Gold Lion for Press Campaign in non-alcoholic beverages categor.

O&M is showing the way, this time bagging the Gold for BusinessWorld magazine, with Ogilvy One Worldwide, the direct marketing arm of O&M, picking up a Bronze for Hutchison Telecom. Despite two nominations for O&M and one for McCann-Erickson in the media category, there werenâ€™t any Indian wins there. â€˜â€˜Indian entries, especially the winners, came up with refreshing creative, with the right message delivered to the right people at the right time,â€™â€™ says Rajat Sethi, jury member of Lions Direct and CEO, Wunderman India, at a press conference.

The Grand Prix, for those who care, went to Young & Rubicam, Sydney, for its client Jim Bean Brands Australia, but thatâ€™s hardly the big story for Indians here. From Mumbai and Delhi to Chennai and Cannes, O&M is celebrating the grand haul with champagne and cake. â€˜â€˜Weâ€™re all on top of the world,â€™â€™ says Saroja Kannan, branch head, OgilvyOne Chennai, which did the Hutch work.

And she stressed it was doubly sweet, since the award came in the first year of OgilvyOneâ€™s existence.

Jury chairman Daniel Morel says: â€˜â€˜Only the edgy and the less predictable work wins at Cannes.â€™â€™ The Indians have been more than edgy and totally unpredictable at Cannes this year. Sagar Mahableshwarkar and Pushpinder Singh from O&M and Prasoon Joshi of McCann-Erickson went up on stage to lift their Golds from Dan Wieden, jury chairman and founder of Wieden - Kennedy, making the more than 80 Indians swell with pride. After the ceremony, voice artiste Chetan Shashital led the charge as loud cheers of â€˜Bharat Mata Ki Jaiâ€™ rent the air.

It took bhangra to set the legs shaking, the shapely hips swaying. The French, the Italian, the Slovenians and the Filipinos set the beach on fire as bhangra played on and on.

Maverick film-maker Tarsem, a Grand Prix winner, said, â€˜â€˜Iâ€™ve come to Cannes after ten years, that, too, because of pressure from my producer. Iâ€™ve won every possible award thatâ€™s there to be won, but Iâ€™ve never gone to receive any. I donâ€™t even know where the awards are lying, or with whom.â€™â€™

Clients should take lessons from A.K. Dhingra, director (sales and marketing), Perfetti India, whoâ€™s at the heart of all the creative action at Cannes.

Not only is he attending the festival, heâ€™s making mental notes about some really great advertising on display here.

23,Chautala rules Sirsa,"RANIA (SIRSA): Om Prakash Chautala may hold the reins of Haryana but in Sirsa district, particularly in Rania and Ellenabad tehsils, former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal is the de facto ruler.

Every word of the Badal family is honoured by the district police and the administration without any hitch, as if it came directly from the mouth of the Haryana chief minister. Most of the elected representatives in the area rue that they have no voice in administrative decisions here.

Closeness between Badal and Chautala families is over two decades old now and they are known to stand by each other in the hours of crisis.

What further cemented these relations was the construction of a statue in the memory of former Haryana chief minister Devi Lal at Killianwali in Muktsar district about two years ago by the then Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal at the expenses of the state exchequer.

Much to the dismay of many INLD leaders, after the construction of palatial Balasar farmhouse, Badals'' interference in the administrative and police affairs increased all of a sudden. â€˜â€˜We were completely sidelined,'''' said a senior INLD leader of the area on condition of anonymity. The extent to which the Haryana administration could go to help Badal was evident during run-up to the SGPC presidential election in Punjab, he added. The influence of the Badal family is so strong in the area that neither any official nor any INLD leader has the courage to challenge their supremacy in the area, fearing Chautala family''s wrath.

An official at Rania police station told TOI that not only the revenue officials-from a patwari to a tehsildar-were appointed in this area as per Badals'' choice but postings in the area police too were made after getting a nod from them.

Every week a Badal family member visits Balasar farmhouse routinely. And it was during this time that the area police and the administration were always on their toes to keep the visiting member in good spirit, said the official.
