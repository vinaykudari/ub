3,Your papers with govt? Get a copy now,"PATNA: Government offices in Bihar are facing a serious threat - from termites.

Various departments of the state government are still waiting for computerisation to take place. ""There are more than one crore documents at various registration offices in Bihar. We have to issue their certified copies when demanded by the people,"" said minister for registration V S Dubey.

Dubey pointed out that the responsibility of maintaining the registration office buildings is on the state building construction department. ""I have written several letters to the department asking it to ensure proper maintenance of the registration office buildings as the documents kept there are perishable,"" he added.

Alarmed by the termites posing a serious threat to the documents, the registration department has asked the registrars to get all the original documents photocopied and return them (original copies) to the parties concerned.

Around six months ago, the chief minister had ordered for computerisation of the registration department offices for ensuring that their data and records do not remain just on perishable papers. The science and technology department was entrusted with the task of computerisation.

The state legislative council committee dealing with questions and calling-attention motions has, in a report, suggested immediate repair of the registration department buildings in order to check further damage to the records due to rains and termites. The report is in response to a question raised by Ram Kripal Yadav who alleged that termites have destroyed thousands of documents.

In its reply to the committee, the registration department admitted that termites have caused damage to at least 44 documents at the Patna registration office and that it is creating parallel files of these documents. The department said the documents are at present kept on age-old steel racks of the office and added that Rs 70,000 is spent every year on the maintenance of the documents.

The registration department said the building construction department had been requested to repair the Patna registration office building, ""but only minor repairs to the dilapidated building have been made.""

State Vigilance Bureau officials say when they ask for relevant documents, different departments often express their inability, maintaining that they have been destroyed by termites.

4,Private medical colleges worry state government,"PATNA: The establishment of private medical and para-medical institutions without any no-objection certificate from the state government has become a matter of concern for the state''s medical education department.

The department has advised students not to take admission in such medical institutions without ascertaining if they were recognised by the state government and their respective councils, or if they were affilitated to any university of the state.

The government has also decided to take legal action against the institutions concerned. Medical education secretary Afzal Amanullah had recently warned people against such medical and para-medical institutions by inserting advertisements in different newspapers.

Examination controller of the department Dr Captain N P Yadav had asked the SSP of Patna to lodge an FIR against Surendra Medical College and Hospital, Shivala Mor, Khagaul, Patna, saying it was established without any NOC from the government.

Yadav, in a communication to the Patna SSP, has informed him that Surendra Medical College and Hospital has been selling forms and prospectus at a price of Rs 250 each and its registered office is located on the Exhibition Road. It has been inviting applications for admission in MBBS, BDS and para-medical courses, Yadav said.

Under the provisions of the Medical Council of India (Amended) Act, 1993, seeking an NOC from the state government concerned for establishing a medical or dental college is mandatory. Apart from it, the college concerned must be affiliated to the university under whose jurisdiction it fell.

Yadav said the state government had not given NOC to Surendra Medical College and Hospital, nor it is affiliated to Magadh University under whose jurisdiction it fell.

The college was opened without the permission of MCI, Dental Council of India (DCI) and the Centre, Yadav said, adding that it is misleading students for personal benefit. Yadav has also requested Patna SSP to lodge an FIR against B P Medical College and Hospital, Patna, on similar grounds.

The medical education department has also requested the West Champaran SP to lodge an FIR against Bettiah Medical College and Hospital, Beldari Tola, Main Road, Barbat Pasren, Bettiah, and its founder saying the college had been established in violation of MCI Act, 1993, and the Bihar Medical Education (Regulation and Control) Act, 1981.

Deputy secretary for medical education S K Singh, on July 28, informed the West Champaran SP that the Bettiah Medical College and Hospital had not got NOC from the state government, nor was it affiliated to the university under whose jurisdiction it fell.

5,Rival BJP factions clash,"DHANBAD: BJP stalwarts never get tired of saying that theirs is a party with a difference. But the actual situation in the party was evident on Thursday when two factions fought with each other over the election of party president for Nirsa division of the district.

Fisticuffs, shoes and hockey sticks were used freely in the scuffle that ensued and one of the district-level office-bearer of the business cell of the party even took out a pistol and threatened members of the other faction with dire consequences.

The supporters of Dhanbad MP, Rita Verma, including her representative Satyadeo Goswami, were forced to leave the place after which Ashok Gupta was elected as president of the division. According to sources, a meeting of all 41 panchayat committees of Nirsa division was convened at Kharakiya Dharmshala on Thursday to elect the division president. But the meeting resulted in a pandemonium in the election hall.

The hockey stick-wielding supporters of district BJP president Satyendra Kumar Singh forced Goswami and his supporters, including the outgoing Nirsa division president Munnu Tiwary, to leave the place.

Later, Ashok Gupta was elected president of Nirsa division of the party with consensus. The meeting, held under the chairmanship of district BJP president, also decided to recommend expulsion of four party cadres, including one Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, on disciplinary grounds.

Meanwhile, Nirsa police have lodged a case against Sanjeev Sinha, Basant Burman and Vijay Singh for their unlawful activities during the meeting, following a complaint filed by district BJP secretary Ganesh Mishra.

When asked, district BJP president Satyendra Kumar Singh termed the incident as unfortunate and informed that 35 out of 41 panchayat party presidents had given their support in favour of Ashok Gupta.

On the other hand, Satyadeo Goswami has termed the election of Ashok Gupta as illegal.

6,"Ignore SIs’selection list, HC tells Govt","LUCKNOW: Justice UK Dhaon of the high court here has directed the government to ignore the selection list of sub-inspectors (civil police) and PAC platoon commanders. Justice Dhaon also ordered that 50 per cent of the posts should be filled on the basis of reservation and the remaining by general candidates who are in the merit list.

The court passed the above interim order in three separate writ petitions filed by Indrapal Singh and others, Anirudh Kumar Singh and others and Vishnu Kumar Varma.

It was argued that the reservation policy providing more than 50 per cent for the SC/ST/OBC candidates was against the reservation policy of the government. It was submitted that the respondents had prepared a list illegally and arbitrarily with SC/ST/OBC candidates accounting for 78 per cent of the total candidates selected for interview, due to which the petitioners were deprived of a chance to get selected for the interview despite writing their examination well.

It was submitted that as per the list of candidates selected for interview was published in the newspapers on July 28 last only 20 per cent posts were left for the candidates of general categories, ignoring the provisions of reservation policy.

It was observed that the Supreme Court has held that the reservation policy cannot exceed more than 50 per cent of the total posts. And sub-clause 2 of Clause 6 of the advertisement also provides that in no case that percentage of reserved category posts would exceed 50 per cent of the total posts.

Justice Dhaon while directing for the listing of the petition in the week commencing from September 29 next for hearing said that it would be open for the respondents to fill the remaining vacancies from amongst the reserved and general catagory candidates strictly in accordance with the law.

7,How a consensus on admissions was clinched?,"BANGALORE: What clinched the consensus agreement that eluded the state government and college managements for the last six months?

While the government had to protect the interest of the 25 per cent candidates admitted in excess of the apex court''s 50:50 seat-sharing formula, college managements had to conduct a separate admission test, seat-selection process and scout for students to fill seats for its quota.

When both the parties arrived at the discussion table on Friday, their task was cut out: both had to come to the rescue of each other as a saving grace.

The best way out was not to insist on compliance of the apex court''s order for 2003-2004. The managements agreed to regularise the 25 per cent excess admissions by way of complying with the 75:25 formula and the government permitting CET-ranked candidates to be accommodated in the management quota, thereby helping them find students to fill its quota seats.

Both agreed that the SC''s order would be enforced from the next academic year and not this year ""to protect students'' interests''''. And hence, the matter was resolved.

For the record, Jalappa told The Times of India that managements had sought a marginal fee hike for medical courses, but subsequently agreed to the government''s fee structure. ""We asked for a fee of Rs 2.25 lakh for medical seats, but the government refused. Since the fee will prevail for one year only, we did not haggle too much.''''

Asked what purpose the legal battle served, Jalappa said the rights of managements has been clarified by the apex court after the 11-judge bench''s order.

On admissions to 25 per cent management seats, Jalappa said colleges would either conduct an entrance test or consider II PUC performance. ""We cannot conduct another test now as it would delay the academic year. From next year, the consortium will conduct the entrance test for our quota,'''' he said.

This year, colleges will admit students sent by the CET Cell from Saturday onwards, he added.

Earlier, the meeting, which was initially held at the conference hall at Vidhana Soudha, moved to the chief minister''s chamber with leaders holding a separate meeting with Krishna to sort out the ""nitty-gritty''''. It was two long hours before the consensus was announced.

8,Poojary to minister: Work or no assembly ticket,"BANGALORE: KPCC president Janardhana Poojary on Friday came down heavily on revenue minister M. Mallikarjun Nagappa for neglecting his Koppal district and warned that he will not be given a ticket in the next assembly elections if the same attitude continues.

Poojary, who visited Koppal to inspect the breach in the TB canal and meet kin of the farmerâ€™s family where six members committed suicide, was besieged by complaints from locals. They were angry at Nagappa for not visiting or even enquiring about them.

Speaking to The Times of India on his way from Hospet to Bellary, Poojary said: â€œThe breach occurred in Nagappaâ€™s constituency Kanakagiri and he is Koppal district minister. Acres of land in three districts are dependent on this canal; everyone wants to know where Nagappa is but there is no sign of him.â€™â€™

Poojary said he contacted Nagappa and asked him to rush to Koppal. â€œI told him if you do not, ticket will not be given. We have ministers like Ramalinga Reddy and H.M. Revanna who slog, but there are few others who have to gear up,â€™â€™ he maintained.

9,Metro mulls slowing down to cut suicides,"KOLKATA: The Metro Railway authorities are planning to restrict the speed of trains before they enter a station in an effort to bring down the number of suicides.

In a series of meetings held at the Metro headquarters following yet another suicide in the Shyambazar station last Wednesday, it was decided that a campaign would be carried out to inform passengers about the successful rescues conducted by Metro authorities in the first eight months of the this year. Two options were considered by Metro authorities to check suicide attempts.

One was posting at least three guards at the two ends of platforms. â€œWe have drawn the white line or the Laxman Rekha on all platforms. Now, guards could be posted to ensure that no passenger came come close to the platform edges as the train approaches. This would create a psychological pressure on the passengers and simultaneously prevent people from jumping on the rails,â€� said a senior Metro rail officer. However, the option was shot down as the authorities would have to employ an additional 204 securitymen. With losses of the Metro touching Rs 40 crore on an annual basis, the option was not considered viable. The other option was slowing the train before it entered the stations, so the driver could brake if any person jumped on to the tracks.

â€œThis option is being discussed, but this also has problems since we are aiming to reduce the running time of our services,â€� the officer added. Of the 104 suicide attempts from July 1988, 46 died, 34 persons were rescued, 18 were hospitalised and six sustained minor injuries. The rates themselves show that the Metro is always not a â€˜sure optionâ€™ for committing suicide. â€œWe have rescued four people out of the eight suicide attempts committed since January 2003. Our alert station staff, drivers and to some extent the passengers have also contributed to the process,â€� said chief operations manager, Metro Railway, David Topno.

10,Exhibitors dangle `foreign film' carrot before govt,"BANGALORE: With two days to go for the August 25 cabinet meeting, film theatre owners in the state on Friday dangled a `foreign film'' carrot before the government to accept their demand of a reduction in entertainment tax for other language films.

13,Seats for handicapped to be filled under rules: MCI,"PATNA:The Medical Council of India(MCI) has issued guidelines to all the states regarding filling up of three per cent seats reserved in medical colleges for persons having physical disabilities.

Setting at rest the controversy regarding the people qualifying for admission in MBBS course against the seats reserved for those having physical disabilities, the MCI has said that only physically handicapped persons with locomotary disability of lower limbs ranging between 50 % to 70 % should be allowed the benefit of reservation for admission in medical courses under the Disabilities (Equal opportunities, Protection of Right and full participation) Act, 1995.

The upper limbs, according to the MCI guidelines, should be functional and normal to elicit various signs during clinical examination while finer movements were required for performing surgical procedure. Feeling and sensation are important for clinical diagnosis and treatment hence persons having locomotory disorder involving upper limb should not be considered for admission to medical courses.This condition shall apply to admission in all medicine courses for reserved seats, the MCI said.

The MCI secretary Lt Col. Dr A R N Setalvad, in a recent communication to all the states, principals of all the medical colleges and registrars of all the universities, said that visually handicapped and hearing disabled persons should not be considered for admission in MBBS course. The MCI has directed the centre as well as the states to comply with its directive on the matter.

The examination controller of medical education department, N P Yadav, said that the department had forwarded the MCI guidelines to the examination controller of Bihar Combined Entrance Competitive Examination Board for necessary action. Yadav said that MCI guidelines had paved the way for filling up of three per cent seats in reserved category in the six government medical colleges of the state for disabled persons.The deputy secretary of the department S K Singh had a few weeks back sought instructions from the centre in this regard.

The disability certificate should be issued by a duly constituted and authorised medical board, Setelvad said adding that the candidates should obtain the disability certificate from a medical board three months prior to presenting application seeking admission in any medical college by claiming the benefit of reservation for physically handicapped with locomotory disorders. Setalvad said that the executive committee of the MCI had decided that visually handicapped persons and those having hearing defects should be deleted from category of disabled as far as admission in medical courses was concerned.

The MCI while maintaining that broadly persons with disabilities were classified under three categories - visually handicapped, persons suffering from hearing defects and physically handicapped with locomotory disorders - has said that visually handicapped would not be in a position to pursue medical course and do the internship as correct vision was absolutely necessary for the study and practice of medicine.

Similarly, according to the MCI guidelines, hearing impairment will interefere with the training in medical education since the process of hearing of various signs auscultation (listening to sounds of heart, lung or other organ from stethoscope) was absolutely essential to pursue medical training and practice.

The candidates should fulfil minimum eligibility criteria as per the MCI guidelines, Setalvad said adding that they should be otherwise medically fit.
