3,Cong releases first list of nominees for Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: A confident Congress on Monday announced a partial list of candidates for the Gujarat assembly polls with 80 of the 108 nominations going to ""lower caste"" candidates. The remaining 74 have been withheld for ""strategic reasons"".

Amidst allegations of infighting, the Congress claimed that it had made a scientific study of the constituencies and given candidates marks on a scale of 10 before taking a final decision. The party, however, hasn''t named its chief ministerial candidate for which state Congress chief Shankersinh Vaghela and legislature party were considered leading contenders.

In fact, Vaghela â€” who is a member of the Lok Sabha â€” would not even contest. Asked why, he said it was part of the party''s poll strategy. The Congress had even done a candidate-based survey which, according to its leaders, indicated a marginal edge for the party over the BJP. Vaghela termed a news magazine''s survey that predicted a landslide victory for the BJP as that party''s pamphlet. The first list includes as many as 17 candidates from the Patel community, besides 10 other upper caste candidates, seven women and four Muslims.

Candidates have not been decided for eight constituencies, indicating that the Congress is open to electoral adjustments with like-minded parties. However, the party leaders insisted they would offer just three seats to other parties.

The Congress will wait for BJP''s list to announce its next lot of candidates. In fact, the party has kept vacant a few seats just because it anticipates chief minister Narendra Modi to contest from one of the worst riot-hit areas. After Modi''s announcement, the Congress would decide whom to be fielded at the ''epicentres'' of communal violence. Congress'' poll planks are a stable atmosphere for the business community, drinking water, 12-hour electricity to farmers, high-tension power to industry, employment to the youth, cooperative bank scams and the irregularities in earthquake relief distribution.

The Congress leaders refused to accept that there is a Hindutva wave in favour of the BJP. ""If there is a wave, why does the BJP need Keshubhai Patel? Why does the BJP need the VHP yatra? Why did the BJP wait for the Congress list? Why doesn''t Modi announce his constituency? Why do 22 MLAs, among them several ministers, want to change their constituencies? Why would the BJP ask its friendly parties to put up candidates in order to split the non-BJP votes?"" asked AICC general-secretary Kamal Nath.

Vaghela alleged that the VHP worked on BJP money and the objectives of this `anti-Hindu organisation'' are political. His message to Modi was that instead of raking up communal passions, the CM should try and account for the BJP''s term in power.

Though there were allegations of Vaghela getting 40, Chaudhary 20 and Urmilaben Patel 20 nominations for their respective camp followers, Kamal Nath claimed there was no division in the Congress ranks. One of the explanations for the partial list is that the rest 74 seats are more contentious and if anounced early would lead to factionalism.

Earlier in the day, Solanki, Vaghela and Chaudhary met Congress president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the ticket distribution.

6,Muzaffarpur bandh against murder total,"MUZAFFARPUR: Muzaffarpur bandh call given by North Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in protest against the murder of a businessman of Kalyani chowk, Ritesh Kumar Madhyan by a gang of extortionists, evoked massive public support on Monday.

All business premises, cinema halls and educational institutions remained closed and vehicular traffic kept off the road. Traders and shopkeepers took out processions in the town. There was no report of violence or arrest during the bandh.

President of North Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Hanumanmal Bothra said increasing incidents of murder and extortion has posed a challenge to the credibility of the police.

""If such crimes are not checked immediately, trade and commerce are bound to be adversely affected which may eventually result in price rise,â€� he said.

Apradh Unmulan Samiti''s district president Sanjay Kumar Azad and a number of political activists including the CPI (ML) district secretary Meena Tiwari, B J P''s Udyog Manch state president Suresh Sharma have thanked the citizens and traders for showing their solidarity in condemning the murder of a businessman.

7,"India rejects UN panel's bid to link rule of law, terrorism","NEW DELHI: The attempt of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) to emphasise the linkage between rule of law and terrorism has been rebuffed by India which has warned against any attempt at seeking a causal relationship.

Responding in the third committee of the UN General Assembly, India has said: ""Attempts to provide justifications by looking at causal relationships of such acts will only serve as an encouragement to terrorists and detract severely from the global war on terrorism.""

The Indian stand, articulated by TDP MP Yerran Naidu, was in response to the address of the new UNHCHR, Sergio Vieira de Mello, who said: ""Human rights violations risk breeding hatred, resentment and ultimately violence."" De Mello had also expressed his concern at the attempt of some states to take advantage of the current climate to pursue policies that could be used to quell legitimate political dissent and suppress fundamental freedoms, a charge that has been made against the Indian government by critics of Pota.

De Mello had also said that countering terorrism required ""more than a rigorous strategy of appropriate law enforcement"", and that a commprehensive strategy to establish global security must be grounded in promoting respect for human rights through upholding primacy of the law, fostering social justice and enhancing democracy.

While expressing appreciation for the high commissioner''s statement making the rule of law the principle cornerstone, India has also cautioned against the development of new concepts that could be liable to misinterpretation and misuse.

The Indian response also disputed certain suggestions made by the former UNHCHR, Mary Robinson, questioning her suggestions on membership of the commission on human rights and the role of treaty bodies.

Robinson had spoken of the need to expand the individual complaints procedures whereby those who had exhausted domestic remedies could approach the relevant United Nations Treaty body.

Robinson had said in her speech that the committees had urged State parties to grant a host of remedies in response to individual grievances, among them the commutation of death sentences, release of prisoners and reduction of prison terms.

Challenging this concept, India has said: ""The notion that treaty bodies can interfere with the judicial processes of member states by urging them to release prisoners, reduce prison terms, etc"" would be ""the very anti-thesis of the ideas of constitutional order and the rule of law which the new high commissioner promises to uphold and promote.""

India has also suggested that the mechanisms currently mandated to deal with human rights violations should first satisfy themselves that ""domestic remedies have been fully exhausted"".

In conclusion, the speech stressed on the impeccable record of performance and independance of India''s judicial institutions and asserted India''s committment to the rule of law.

8,2 Lankan ministers to visit Delhi this week,"NEW DELHI: Two Sri Lankan Ministers will be here later this week to urge India to take part in the donors conference in Oslo on November 25.

Milinda Moragoda, the minister for science and technology, and Rauff Hakeem, minister for shipping, international rehabilitation and Muslim religious affairs, will both visit New Delhi on November 21 and 22. The Norwegian envoy in Colombo, Jon Westborg, is also expected to visit Delhi.

India is yet to make up its mind on whether it will attend the conference a decision that could be politically sensitive as it will mean sharing the stage with the LTTE, which is banned in this country.

The US, the UK, Japan and Germany are among the countries which will take part in the conference hosted by the Norwegian government. The conference will also see the participation of the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. It is expected to raise funds for development of north-east Sri Lanka.

The external affairs spokesperson said India was yet to make up its mind about the issue which was under consideration. Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga''s People''s Alliance has, however, already hailed India''s `decision'' to stay away from the conference which, it said, would treat the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government on a level of parity.

India will have to make up its mind whether to lose out on a role by staying away or tread the awkward path of joining the conference where Anton Balasingham will represent the LTTE.

The LTTE remains a banned organisation in India and the government has said that its position would not change notwithstanding any change in the position of the Sri Lankan government.

The two Sri Lankan ministers will meet with several Indian leaders, including the external affairs minister, the finance minister and the minister for IT.

9,Stalled health info scheme to be included in WB project,"BANGALORE: This is one pipedream which still has a surviving chance. Karnataka''s ambitious scheme of keeping track of health of the state was stalled because a private firm backtracked due to the prohibitive cost factor. But it could be revived now.

Started in 2000, when Karnataka was in the flush of IT promotion, the Health Management Information System (HMIS) was planned to monitor epidemics and diseases at the click of a mouse. It was initially expected to help the Directorate of Health and Family Welfare improve its services delivery. It envisaged the Diseases Surveillance Information System (DSIS) with the networking of health offices in districts.

Unaware of the cost factor, a private company volunteered to set up the HMIS and later abandoned it, depriving the state of not just the facility, but the status of being a pioneer. ""The software company which volunteered to provide the wireless, Internet and broadband did not realise the time and money it would have to spend. It gave up. We are reviving it now, but funds are a constraint,"" sources said.

To salvage it, the state government has decided to include it in the Rs 875-crore World Bank assistance sought for the Karnataka integrated health, nutrition and family welfare services project. ""The IT component is Rs 60 crore and pending before the Planning Commission."" An early resurrection for HMIS is foreseen, with the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare convening a meeting on December 15 to launch HMIS in all states with possibilities of part-funding it.

The Karnataka Task Force on Health and Family Welfare, in its report in April 2001, had recommended: ""HMIS to be in place by end of 2001."" It suggested the DSIS component could include the Geographic Information System of the areas to visually help locate diseases.

""Otherwise, the report will be just a list of villages affected by an epidemic. Visual digitisation of villages will help map out the affected areas,"" sources said.

Once the project is revived, the National Informatics Centre will provide connectivity to the 1,676 primary health centres and 23,767 units.

""In 1995, when plague broke out in Karnataka, the gravity of the situation was not the epidemic, but the communication gap between the government machinery in the state capital and districts. Seven years down the line, the situation remains static in the absence of HMIS,"" sources said.

10,"Follow the Guru's ideals, minister tells Billawas","MANGALORE: Kerala Minister Sudakaran recently exhorted people of the Billawa community to emolate the preachings of Sri Narayana Guru. He said the Guru''s contribution as a social reformer had relevance even to this day.

Inaugurating the â€˜Guruvandana'' programme of Athmananda Saraswathi Swami organised by the Narayana Guru Yuva vedike at the Town Hall here, he said the Guru had sought the liberation of the Billawas in Kerala which paved the way for liberation of other backward castes.

""The period of Narayana Guru allowed the practise of oppressive tactics on lower castes by the higher castes. In the early 19th century, lower castes, especially in Kerala had no rights whatsoever. They had no freedom to worship, no freedom to cover their bodies decently and no freedom even to use the public roads. And, they were subjected to irrational methods of punishment even for the smallest crime, while members of the hi ith a minimal fine even for the largest crime"", he added.

""Narayana Guru needs to be given his due for his selfless devotion to the cause of the liberation of the oppressed. He was a leader, a social reformer, an economist and a revolutionary. It is only through his efforts that the Billawas, who were once subjected to oppressive tactics, have progressed."" State Minister for Ports and Fisheries Vasanth Salian said the philosophy of â€˜one caste, one faith and one religion'' as propounded by the Guru must be followed in principle. ""The differences in caste and religion should not come in the way of progress. There is a need to work towards tackling social and educational backwardness and the efforts will have to be by the government and the society"", he added.

As part of the deliberation, six achievers from the community who include surgeon Dr Venkatesh Sanjeeva, stage actor Naveen Padil, journalist Harish Karkera, student leader Kiran Kumar, fire fighter Lokesh and swimmer Ashwin Kumar B.H. were felicitated.

The president of the Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat Jyothi R. Salian, president of the Akhila Bharathiya Billawara Union Naveenchandra Suvarna, vice-president of the Billava Jagruthi Balaga, Mumbai, Suresh Poojary, president of the Kerala Samajam T.K. Rajan were also present.

11,"Mob behaviour in Godhra, Sikh riots similar: Nanavati","NEW DELHI: Throwing light on an important aspect of the Gujarat riots, Justice G T Nanavati, heading the inquiry commission into it, on Tuesday said mob behaviour at Godhra and other places of the BJP-ruled state appears to be similar to the one witnessed during the anti-Sikh riots in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi assassination.

""The behaviour of mob at Godhra during the carnage in February this year and that during the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi appears to be similar,"" said Justice Nanavati, who is also heading oneman commission to probe into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

The commission is expected to start from November 20 recording of evidence of the passengers who were travelling on the Sabarmati Express on the day of the incident, the retired Supreme Court judge said. At least 58 people, including 25 women and 15 children, were killed and 43 others injured when a violent mob set on fire four coaches of Sabarmati Express carrying â€˜Ramsevaksâ€™ from Ayodhya on February 27.

Asked about the progress made in the inquiry into the riots into other parts of the state, Justice Nanavati said ""extensive work has been done and sufficient evidence has been collected in regard to the Godhra incident.""

""We have examined officials from the railway, railway protection force, local administration and police.

We need to examine the passengers of the train and after such examination the gathering of evidence regarding the Godhra incident would be complete,"" he said.

Asked whether the witnesses faced any kind of threat or difficulty in expressing their views before the commission, Justice Nanavati said it was more an apprehension entertained by the media.

""The recording of evidence is going on absolutely peacefully and there is no threat of any kind to any witness for coming to give his evidence,"" he said adding ""wherever required the commission will provide adequate protection to the witnesses.""

""If at all any witness had any fear in coming forward to give evidence, he can give his statement in confidence,"" he said.

The commission, also comprising retired Gujarat High Court judge, Justice K G Shah, has divided its work into three categories â€” relating to the Godhra carnage, the riots in Ahmedabad and the riots in other parts of the state. The commission decided to deal with the incidents which took place in Ahmedabad last due to the large number of incidents that took place there in the aftermath of Godhra, Justice Nanavati said.

Asked what was his prima facie opinion on the evidence collected so far, the former apex court judge said ""it will be improper to give any prima facie opinion till the inquiry is completed.""

He said all concerned, including the government, was co-operating in the work of the commission and added ""any opinion regarding negligence or lack of effort on the part of the authorities during the riots can only be found out after careful scrutiny of all the material and evidence.""

12,GenNext has mixed feelings for polls,"VADODARA: ""Elections, what elections? Studentâ€™s elections got over long ago."" ""Not those yaar, the ones where those BJP, Congress people come home to give those leaflets.""

The above conservation was heard between two first year science students of M S University. While the eyes of the entire nation are on Gujarat as elections draw near, first-time voters have mixed feelings. TNN spoke to students of M S University on forthcoming elections, their views and whether they would cast their mandate.

A large number of students appeared all charged up to cast their mandate in favour of a particular political party. Students, sure of their ideology, are likely to cast their mandate in favour of this particular party. Others apathetic to the political scenario â€” notwithstanding the Godhra carnage and the ensuing communal violence that shook the country â€” appeared interested only in their textbooks and examination schedules.

Random examples of reactions from the campus.

Samir Joshi, a third year student of the faculty of commerce says, ""I will definitely cast my vote. I am looking forward to it and have already decided who I will vote for. I want my vote to be counted,"" he says.

Rahul Shirlal, a student of MSc says, ""I plan to vote as it is a right that should be exercised by all citizens. I missed casting my vote last time as I did not receive my election I card, but this year I will get my card.""

For some students elections round the corner are â€˜newsâ€™. ""Oh, are elections going to be held soon? Yes I want to vote, this is the first time I will get a chance to vote,"" says Jigisha Jethwa a first year science student. ""But I have no idea who to vote for. Politicians hardly care, once elected they disappear,"" she continues.

A third year student of science Kinjal Parikh says, ""Sikko api ne avi javanu"" (put a stamp and come). I missed voting last time as we did not get our Icard, this year I hope my name is registered in the voterâ€™s list.""

Some students are already disgruntled with politicians. Says Dhruv Patel, ""Thereâ€™s too much corruption in the society. I donâ€™t want to vote,"" says this third year commerce student.

Rita Pande (name changed) who has just turned 18 and can cast her mandate believes the same, ""Politicians donâ€™t matter. I have no plan to go out to vote,"" she said as she continued munching her gum sitting next to her boyfriend near the H M Library.

13,HCCI gives govt 15 days to revoke notification on MRP,"PANCHKULA: The Haryana Chamber of Commerce and Industries (HCCI) has given a 15-day deadline to the state government to withdraw its notification on the levying of sales tax on the maximum retail price (MRP). ""If the sales tax is levied, it will burden the common man, who will be forced to pay 5 per cent more for a product than he is paying now. It will also prove detrimental for trade and industry in the state,"" HCCI president C B Goel said here on Tuesday.The HCCI demanded that ST-38 forms should available in shops rather than the department and that the local area development tax should be abolished. The HCCI also demanded that the decision of abolishing rebates on petroleum-based products should be withdrawn.Goel said that such moves would discourage those industrialists and traders who had successfully met the challenges posed by the WTO and multinational companies and could adversely affect foreign direct investment and discourage those NRIs who were willing to to set up their enterprises in the state.The HCCI is planning to take up the issue with the chief secretary and the chief minister. ""An association of chemists had observed a day-long bandh in protest against the move and more traders' bodies are likely to follow suit,"" said an HCCI representative.

14,Nobody helped when Gujarat burned: minister,"MUMBAI: Despite repeated pleas by the Narendra Modi government, Congress-led governments in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh refused to send reserve police forces to Gujarat during its cataclysmic riots, Gujarat agriculture minister Purushottam Rupala alleged.

â€œWe did not reveal this fact at the height of the communal disturbances, to ensure that there was no panic. But the refusal by these states was at the instigation by certain forces which were interested in continuing violence in Gujarat,â€™â€™ Mr Rupala told the press recently.

15,No arrests in tree hacking case,"MUMBAI: The Trombay police is still to arrest the proprietors of S.B. Advertising for allegedly hacking 750 trees on the Mankhurd-Vashi highway last Tuesday. The trees were axed to improve the visibility of hoardings.

A police officer from Trombay said, â€œWe are gathering evidence against the ad agency. So far, we have not been able to find any witness to the tree felling case and are now inquiring among residents in neighbouring areas if they have any information regarding the incident.â€�

The proprietor of S.B. ad agency, Satish Buddhadev, had denied his agencyâ€™s involvement in tree hacking when questioned by the police. He reportedly told the police that the felling was the work of his business rivals. When contacted by TNN, Mr Buddhadev declined to name any rival agency.

He claimed that the ad agencyâ€™s lease contract with the Central Railway for the sites along the Mankhurd-Vashi highway had expired in August and the agency was not getting any advertisements as its lease had not been renewed.

16,J&K govt to pass Bill to ensure accountability,"JAMMU: In a bid to ensure a clean administration, the Congress-PDP government is planning to introduce a Bill on accountability during the special session of the assembly, scheduled to begin on Thursday.

The Bill sought to make the chief minister and his council of ministers answerable to the people, said deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma.

Just as charity began at home, accountability should begin with ministers themselves, said Sharma. He said if promulgated, the Bill would ensure an administration, which was responsible and responsive to peopleâ€™s needs.

The Bill is likely to be drafted by law and finance minister Muzaffar Hussain Beigh, who is also a reputed Supreme Court lawyer.

Asserting that the government would act tough against militants, Sharma said innocent blood would not be allowed to shed.

He said the coalition government was looking forward to talks with the Kashmir Committee.
