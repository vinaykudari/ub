1,Russia's ex-rulers say they’ve learnt the democracy lesson,"NEW DELHI: A decade after the collapse of the Soviet empire, Russian communists have admitted that for them the only road to power goes through the polling booth.

On their first visit to a country Moscow once saw as an important ally, senior leaders of the Russian communist party said here on Tuesday that they would take the vote route to regain power in the land of the October Revolution. In a mood to rethink and readjust, they are keen to erase from their collective memory Lenin''s famous dictum that Parliament was a ""pigsty."" As far as their new role in Russian politics was concerned, they were candid about their willingness to shed much of the old baggage and adjust to the new situation. ""Our next revolution is through Parliament,"" the two said unhesitantly.

Leonid Ivanchenko, vice-chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), and his colleague, Sergei Afanasiev, member of the Duma, admitted during an interactive session with the media that they had a lot to learn from China.

Terming Mikhail Gorbachev as the ""leader of the pack of traitors who ganged up to destroy the party from within,"" they said the gradual shift in China from control to market economy was the right path. In an oblique reference to the pitiable state of the Russian economy, they said that China was an acknowledged strong power. The glasnost slogan, Ivanchenko and Afanasiev pointed out, was the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union.

Recovering from the aftershocks of the Soviet disintegration which had since irrevocably changed the world ^ prompting new-age commentators to term the momentous event as the ""end of history"" ^ the born-again communists have taken a fresh look at their past. The two admitted that somewhere along the line the command economy concept had not worked.

With 126 seats in the 445-strong Duma, the party polled 25 per cent of the votes in the last general election. Their allies won another 11 seats. ""We have demanded that the party which polls the highest number of votes be allowed to form the government,"" they said. The two claimed that in terms votes polled, their party was the largest.

It seems the CPRF''s growing vote share since the cataclysmic events of 1991 -- 13 per cent of votes in the first elections to 22 per cent in the second to 25 per cent in the latest -- has spurred its ambition and adaptability.

3,BJP will bite the dust in next polls: Laloo,"HAJIPUR: â€œWe will have Lok Sabha elections in March next year and the people of Bihar will play a major role by uprooting the NDA government,â€� said Laloo Prasad Yadav here on Monday.

Yadav was on way to Sonepur to attend the inaugural ceremony of the Hariharkshetra fair. Accusing the Vajpayee government, Laloo Yadav said the BJP has emerged as a major threat to the security of nation.

â€œCommunalism propogated by the NDA has badly damaged the social fabric of India and it is only the people of Bihar who would rescue the country from the grip of BJP and its allied forces in the next parliament elections,â€� said Laloo.

â€œThere is need to shun a caste-based politics in Bihar and I call upon the people of all castes to come ahead and make a society which is not divided on caste lines,â€� the former chief minister said.

Laloo urged the people to remain united as it was the need of the hour. Devotees throng ghats: A large number of people assembled at different ghats of rivers Ganga and Gandak here in the wee hours of Tuesday to take a holy dip on Kartik Purnima on Tuesday.

The authorities in Vaishali and Saran districts had made elaborate safety arrangements and deployed forces at several places.

4,Electioneering hots up for Bar Council polls,"PATNA: Electioneering for the election of members of the Bihar State Bar Council, a statutory legal body, is going on in full swing. The voting will take place on November 22. In all, there are altogether 106 candidates, including 67 from the Patna High Court, for 25 posts. Two women candidates â€” Mridula Mishra and Nilima Sinha â€” are also in the fray.

About 48,000 registered advocates practising in the Patna High Court, district and subdivisional courts will exercise their franchise on November 22, for which altogether 92 polling booths have been set up in the high court, district and sub-divisional courts. After bringing ballot boxes to the Bar Council Bhavan here, counting of votes will begin, for which no date has been fixed as yet. The date of announcement of results is not certain as of now.

Since the term of the members is that of five years, the election to the Bar Council is supposed to be held at an interval of five years. Although the last election was held in 1994, the next next election â€” due for 1999 â€” could not be held. As a result, the state Bar Council with old members was dissolved and an ad hoc committee, under the ex-officio chairmanship of advocate-general Shashi Anugrah Narayan, had been functioning. Narayan has appointed V N Sinha as returning officer for the election.

Sitting members, like Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Rajendra Prasad Singh, Keshav Shrivastava, Yaduvansh Giri, Manan Kumar Mishra, Baleshwar Sharma, Ramchandra Jha, Bibhuti Prasad Pandey and Akhauri Mangalacharan Shrivastava, have also jumped into the poll arena. Also contesting are High Court Advocatesâ€™ Associationâ€™s general secretary Yogesh Chandra Verma and Bihar State Advocatesâ€™ Association president Rajeshwar Prasad Sinha.

According to Rajeshwar Prasad Sinha, about 10,000 have been deprived of the voting rights this time, since they owe some amount to the Central Welfare Fund and failed to return the same in time. Protesting this decision, he said that the defaulter advocates should have been deprived of the benefits of the welfare fund and not that of voting rights. Meanwhile, a war of posters has added colour to the campaigning. Whether it is the high Court or civil courts of the state, including the district court of Patna, all the walls are covered with posters of candidates with their photographs and serial numbers in the ballot papers, along with an appeal to their colleagues to cast their â€˜first preferenceâ€™ votes to them only. Besides, the contestants are distributing small cards, with their names, photographs and serial numbers printed on them. Some of these cards have next yearâ€™s calender printed on them to attract the voters.

Putting a smiling face with folded hands, they can be seen soliciting votes for themselves.

9,Sonia lambasts NDA govt on drought,"NEW DELHI: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday made a scathing attack on the NDA government''s handling of drought situation in the country charging it with failure to provide food security and demanded immediate formulation of a drought management code to tackle such calamities.

Despite the government was privileged to have largest foodgrain stocks in the history of the nation, it ""failed miserably to provide basic and essential food security where it was needed most"", Gandhi said moving an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on the issue.

The leader of the Opposition regretted that the Centre, despite acknowledging its own shortcomings in the matter, sought to shift responsibility on the states repeatedly.

""There are limits to what states can do without adequate support from the Centre. The drought has badly impacted the states irrespective of the party in power.""

Sonia wanted formulation of a drought management code comprising appropriate legislation and codifying details of action plan to provide immediate relief to the affected people.

Noting that the problem of starvation at a time when godowns were overflowing was a ""blot on society"", she said the recent deaths in the party-ruled Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh were not due to starvation.

11,"Telecom industry likely to increase by Rs 1,16,600 cr by 2006","NEW DELHI: The Indian telecommunication industry comprising services and equipment market is expected to increase to Rs 1,16,600 crore by 2006, up from Rs 65,800 crore in 2001, according to market research firm Frost & Sullivan.

In a study of the Indian telecom sector, Frost & Sullivan said the telecom services market in the country was worth approximately Rs 39,342 crore in 2001. It is estimated to increase to Rs 73,846 crore in 2006 with a compound annual growth rate of 13.42 per cent.

In the mainline segment, the subscribers are estimated to reach 67 million in 2006 with a CAGR of 10.14 per cent. Revenues from the domestic mainline and international mainline segments are expected to grow with CAGRs of 10.83 per cent and negative 2.33 per cent, respectively.

The report estimates that the total international long distance traffic will grow at a CAGR of 14.30 per cent over 2002-2006. The estimation of negative growth in the ILD segment revenue is due to drastic fall in tariffs.

The required investment for both basic and NLD services is expected to be complemented by both government companies as well as the private sectors that include foreign operators.

Total investment is estimated to reach Rs 37,400 crore at the end of the forecast period with a CAGR of 11.3 per cent wherein the private operators'' investment is expected to be 40 per cent of the total investment.

Likewise, the cellular subscribers are expected to reach 298.6 crore with a CAGR of 37.57 per cent. Currently, the cellular segment, which accounts for 5.01 per cent of the telecom industry, is expected to grow over 17.94 per cent by 2006.

Frost & Sullivan estimates the total telecom equipment segment to reach Rs 42,841 crore at the end of the forecast period with a CAGR of 10.08 per cent.

The current investment trends in the telecom infrastructure are likely to accelerate and the demand for networking, Internet applications, and wireless communication is expected to result in exponential growth for the telecom equipment segment.

â€œThe entry of new operators and the introduction of new services coupled with the increasing importance of the wireless mode are factors that are likely to contribute to the growth in the number of subscribers in the cellular segment,â€� as per the report.

â€œThe continuing innovations in technologies with the introduction of the Internet Protocol (IP)-based service, increasing data traffic, and continued deregulation efforts by the Indian government should help the industry post a double-digit growth throughout the forecast period. While revenues from voice services are likely to grow at a steady rate, those from data services are expected to increase tremendously,â€� the report added.

â€œThe low interest rate regime prevailing in the Indian economy should help the industry raise funds at a competitive rate and re-schedule some of the high cost debt taken in the early period of telecommunications liberalisation,â€� it said.

â€œWith a teledensity of four in 2000, the country has huge potential for the expansion of basic services throughout India. It is estimated that every 1 per cent increase in teledensity increases the nation''s GDP by 3 per cent.â€�

The proposed investment under the 10th Five-Year Plan is expected to provide communication facilities to all villages. Moreover, national Internet backbone and the Sanchar Sagar projects, if completed, can lead to higher usage of communication facilities by all sections of the people, thereby having a positive influence on the overall telecom industry. Moreover, the proactive approach of the government exhibited in the merging of the IT and Communications Ministries have created a conducive environment for faster decision-making, the survey noted.

J Ramesh, a research analyst with Frost & Sullivan, said: â€œThe entry of new operators and the introduction of new services coupled with the increasing importance of the wireless mode are factors that are likely to contribute to the growth in the number of subscribers in the cellular segment.â€�

â€œThe continuing innovations in technologies with the introduction of the Internet Protocol (IP)-based service, increasing data traffic, and continued deregulation efforts by the Indian government should help the industry post a double-digit growth throughout the forecast period,â€� he added.

The opening up of the international long distance (ILD) services, rapid implementation of the reforms, and legalisation of Internet telephony should result in huge investment in the industry, which could help attain the targeted teledensity of 15 by 2010, the report said.

This report has studied country-specific factors political, business policy, and macro economic indicators that have an impact on telecom and its segments.

12,Lawyers campaign for Bar Council polls,"CHANDIGARH: Soliciting votes for the upcoming bar council elections is proving to be an exhaustive exercise for the contestants.

Miles away from their comfortable offices, they have been toiling in remote districts of Punjab and Haryana to garner support for election to the 25-member council.

One of the contestants and an incumbent bar council member, Suraj Prakash Gupta, says, ""Lawyers had started canvassing as early as one year ahead of the election."" An electorate of over 29,000 advocates will decide the fate of the 116 candidates in fray for the council elections.

Taking into consideration that the count of Chandigarh-based advocates is only around 5,600, contestants have to head for district and sub-divisional courts in Punjab and Haryana for bettering their odds to get elected.

Taken together, Chandigarh and the two states account for more than 35,000 advocates, including roughly 6,000 who have not been included in the electoral register due to nonpayment of welfare fund or have joined service.

Former Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association president Daya Chaudhary who kicked off her campaign about three months ago says, ""I have visited most districts in Haryana and some parts of Punjab. I am contesting the council elections for the first time and want to give my best shot.""

Honorary secretary Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana C M Munjal, who is eying a bar council seat for the third time in row, has been touring the rural hinterland for the last one month to â€˜cash in on his goodwill.â€™

Revival of local contacts has also assumed significance as 47 of the 116 contestants are from the city itself. Former Punjab advocate general G K Chatrath, who is also a contesting candidate, says, "" Local candidates cannot ignore the Chandigarh electorate.""

13,Lawyers make promises ahead of Council polls,"CHANDIGARH: It''s a campaign that circles round myriad promises. In the run-up to the Bar Council of Panjab and Haryana elections, scheduled for November 22 and 23, lawyers have sufficiently demonstrated their proclivity for making promises.

Election manifestos of contenders touch on multifarious issues such as supporting the council''s affiliation to the London-based International Bar Association (IBA), championing the cause of lady lawyers and accelerating the setting up of a law college wherein 50 per cent seats would be reserved for wards of advocates.

Contestants have also promised to press for amendments to the Bar Council of India (BCI) rules in order that advocates can solicit for clients with a certain measure of free will, obligatory stipend for junior lawyers, pension for retirees and diverting more funds to district bar associations.

Anmol Rattan Sidhu, incumbent chairman of the council and a contestant, says his main concern is to divert more funds to district bar associations by means of enhancing the bar council stamp fee.

A website to apprise lawyers of the council''s objectives, its functioning and monetary aspects is also mooted by him.

Sidhu underscores that improving the working conditions of junior lawyers is vital, but is quick to add that the council does not have the wherewithal to pay them stipend. He says, ""Certain manifestos are full of prevarications. The council cannot take the strain of handing out salaries or granting pension to lawyers.""

Sidhu prides in getting the Rs 4-crore Law Bhawan project off the ground, disbursing library grants to district bar associations and adding Rs 40 lakh to the welfare fund of the council and Rs 30 lakh to the building fund during his five-year tenure. He is among the 116 candidates in fray for the 25 bar council seats.

Former president of the Panjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association, Daya Chaudhary, places a high premium on facilitating lawyers forge better relationships with each other. She regards defending the dignity of the profession as equally critical. ""We need to stem the rot, or else it will devour the entire set-up. Also, women have to be encouraged to become lawyers.""

Chaudhary had the distinction of being the first woman in India to be elected as the president of a bar association in 1999. She is one of the two women candidates contesting the bar council election.

Manifestos also state raising the compensation for death of a lawyer from Rs one lakh to Rs two lakh as main election plank.

Amrik Singh Kalra, incumbent member of the council, says, ""The bar council has to generate resources to increase the compensation component. We will push for distributing it in lump sum."" He promises to support amendments to BCI rules that ""hamper the working of young lawyers.""

14,Tight security for traders' bandh,"CHANDIGARH: The UT Police has made massive arrangements in the city in view of apprehension of confrontation between groups for and against the bandh call given by Chandigarh Beopar Mandal on Thursday.

Even as a large number of traders in the city have decided to support the bandh call given by Chandigarh Beopar Mandal to protest against the notification on the Rent Act, many traders have volunteered to keep their shops open.

In a monthly crime meeting held on Wednesday all Station House Officers (SHOs) and DSPs have been asked to maintain extra vigilance in view of the bandh call. Additional forces have been called from other units to maintain law and order in the city and prevent forceful closure of shops if any bid is made for the same.

A deputation of the joint action forum of Property Owner''s Association met the finance secretary UT on Wednesday to discuss the Rent Act notification. RP Malhotra, general secretary of the forum, said, ""The finance secretary told the deputation in clear words that the step has been taken with entirely national interest in mind and there is no chance to review the step.""

Malhotra said that the forum''s office has been flooded with telephone calls from shopkeepers volunteering to keep their shops open on Thursday. ""Those wanting to defy the bandh call are apprehensive about use of force by unruly elements,"" said Malhotra.

Meanwhile, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal has called upon the traders community not only to keep their shutters down for the entire day but also to hold rallies in sectors to protest against the Rent Act notification.

Jagdish Arora, president of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said that the traders are confident that the bandh will be total.

The â€˜fast unto death'' pledged by Bhajan Kaur and Nirmal Kaur of Chandigarh Tenant''s Federation was broken after seven days on Wednesday after the mayor Lalit Joshi offered juice glasses to the fasting women. Both the women had threatened to immolate themselves on November 25 if the notification was not withdrawn.

Navjit Brar, president of the federation, said that the fast was broken after assurance was given by the mayor that the matter of Rent Act notfication will be taken up with the UT administration.

16,SAD(B) mobilising party workers for Nov 27,"JALANDHAR: It is being said in political circles that things are likely to change in Congress after the SGPC fiasco.

It is felt that Akali Dal Badal) will also see a change, having become overactive after November 12. Its victory is being termed as the 12/11 syndrome for Congress.

Already, there are reports of Akali Dal Badal) having intensified its efforts to mobilise party workers to begin filling jails from November 27. Political observers point out that, with the SGPC infrastructure and the political platform provided by gurdwaras in rural Punjab, Akali Dal (B) has overnight gained an edge in the struggle for power in Punjab.

The Akali Dal is all set to take advantage of the public address systems in gurdwaras and the tradition of langar to mobilise party workers, it is learnt from sources. Veterans say the dal has been spurred to do what it is good at, that is morchas and jail bharo agitations.

The damage control by the chief minister and his men continues in different forms as the latter are learnt to have become aware of the faux pas that was committed before the SGPC elections. Never before have TV viewers and readers learnt so much within a few days, it is now realised.

Sikh politics, the entry of the police into Golden Temple complex, the controversial road separating the sarais from Harmandir Sahib, how a community reacts collectively to the idea of police repression, whatever the motive behind it: the importance of these points has now been learnt.

On November 11, Congress dissidents in Punjab are learnt to have apprised party president Sonia Gandhi of the danger to the party and to her image if the political manoeuvres backfired. It is said that, when informed by party workers from Punjab a day before the event, she relived the traumatic events of her own life. Realising that the blame for police action in Golden Temple could be put on her by the Akalis and Congress could suffer a severe setback, inside sources reveal, she ordered a pullback of police forces on the afternoon of November 11.

18,"BJP hunts for soap tunes, Cong uses riot cassettes","AHMEDABAD: Caretaker chief minister Narendra Modi will owe a lot to Ekta Kapoor for fine-tuning his election campaign. No, Kapoor is not Modiâ€™s election campaigner. But most of the title tunes of her TV soaps have been â€˜â€˜liftedâ€™â€™ by the BJP to get its point across to the electorates of Gujarat.

So donâ€™t be surprised if the title tunes of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi or Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki end up garnering more support for the saffron brigade than Modi and his fiery speeches.

According to Yamal Vyas of the BJPâ€™s media and publicity cell, the party has prepared three sets of audio-cassettes containing slogans and songs which highlight its achievements over the years. While one set is expected to be based on the TV soaps, another set will utilise traditional folk tunes and numbers from films.

â€˜â€˜We are making arrangements at theatres and buying slots on the television channels to show these short capsules of 30 seconds to one minute,â€™â€™ Vyas said.

The Congress, on the other hand, is making audio-visual cassettes which depict how the BJP has tarnished the identities of the state and its people, says Hasmukh Patel of Congress.

â€˜â€˜We are focusing on last governmentâ€™s ineffectiveness and the extent of destruction caused because of the communal violence this year,â€™â€™ he said.

While the party would promote its manifesto through these cassettes, it is creating visuals on how the BJP sponsored riots, Patel informs.

The BJP is also preparing video-tapes and compact discs on the Narmada- related achievements of the government which tried to solve water crisis and the Gokul Gaam concept whereby all 18,000 villages of the state have been provided with the basic amenities.
