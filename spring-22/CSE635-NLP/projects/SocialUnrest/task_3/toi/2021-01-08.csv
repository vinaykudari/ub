0,Two arrested for cellular scam,"NEW DELHI: The special cell has arrested two men who were allegedly running an illegal telephone exchange using Reliance mobile phones.

After making calls worth Rs 10,000, the accused would throw the handsets into the Yamuna. Reliance officials claim that the illegal exchange caused them a loss of Rs 1 crore.

According to the police, Mohammad Zeeshan (24) and Mohammad Irshad (23) purchased the phones for Rs 501 on furnishing forged documents regarding their identity and addresses.

â€˜â€˜The exchange had been operating for more than six months. The two have earned upto Rs 60 lakh. We are trying to locate their associates,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Ashok Chand.

Chand said:â€˜â€˜The accused contacted some persons who run a telephone exchange in Dubai. The facility there is probably legal. Those operators provided the service to Indians living there.â€™â€™

Zeeshan is from Azamgarh and Irshad from Moradabad. The two, police claimed, met in Delhi and rented a flat in Shaheen Bagh, Okhla. The idea to run the illegal exchange struck them when they learned that the Reliance handset had STD, ISD, conferencing and caller identity. They then purchased the other equipment required to run an exchange.

A caller from Dubai would give a missed call on the Reliance phone. The accused then called back on the number and through tele-conferencing would connect them to their relatives in India.

1,Striking medicos to hold rally on Friday,"HYDERABAD/WARANGAL: Striking junior doctors have called for a Chalo Hyderabad rally on Friday in protest against the governmentâ€™s â€˜adamantâ€™ attitude in solving their demands.

On Thursday, student organisations observed a state-wide universities bandh and boycotted classes. In Hyderabad, traffic on the busy Osmania University campus was disrupted for over one hour with the students holding a rally and rasta roko in protest against the government resorting to â€˜forcefulâ€™ methods to suppress the junior doctors strike.

Students boycotted classes and took out a rally from Arts College before staging a dharna on the main road in front of the Engineering College. Speaking at the protest programme, Studentsâ€™ Federation of India (SFI) state vice-president T Sagar said the students organisations would organise a Chalo Hyderabad rally on Friday.

If the government does not come down and solve the demands of the junior doctors, we will give a call for a state-wide bandh soon after consulting political parties and other organisations supporting the movement, he said. Police took the agitating students into custody and restored the traffic movement.

In Warangal, the third day of the strike in the out-patient wing, junior doctors in the MGM Hospital, Warangal, organised a picket and blocked the OP treatment process for two hours.

2,Move to ban persons of foreign origin from polls fails,"GANDHINAGAR: The Modi governmentâ€™s study on the possibility of banning foreign-born Indian citizens from occupying elected positions in local civic bodies has fallen flat on its face. This was after the three-person cabinet sub-panel headed by the law minister Ashok Bhatt failed to report any headway.

The move aimed symbolically at Sonia Gandhi, although she may never have contested a panchayat or municipal election in Gujarat, was announced after a cabinet meeting in November just ahead of the assembly polls in four states.

Meanwhile, officials familiar with the subject say there is hardly any possibility of such a ban. ""The issue has not been found even worth considering,"" said a law department official.

Internal bureaucratic notations, while rejecting the move, have reportedly suggested that people cannot be divided between â€˜naturalised citizensâ€™ and â€˜natural-born citizensâ€™. Any such distinction would go against the concept of equality before the law, granted by the Constitution.

Further, to treat naturalised citizens as less privileged would be to question the sagacity of the Constitution itself, they added.

Pointing out that any law made on this by the state legislature would render the enactment unconstitutional and ultra vires, the notations go on to suggest that it is also not possible to split personalities on the basis those elected in centre or state elections and those elected in local body polls. The government had wished to ban citizens of foreign origin just in local body polls, where, it was suggested, it had jurisdiction.

A top ministerial source, while revealing details of the notations, told TNN that officials had warned the ruling politicians of the illegality of the idea even before the cabinet had announced it.

Referring to the Citizenship Act, 1955, the notations reportedly say that the Indian Constition does not make a distinction between one type of citizens from other types. It does not distinguish the rights of citizens on the basis of how an individual acquires citizenship â€”by birth, descent, registration, naturalisation or incorporation of territory. It does not create ""different classes or categories of citizens.""

Particularly insisting that the state laws have to be in consonance and conformity with the central laws, the notations underline that the authority in the Representation of the Peoplesâ€™ Act of 1950 and 1951 clearly suggest that the authority should be in descending orderâ€”the Constitution, the central acts and the state laws. Hence, the state laws that provide for representation of the people on the local bodies must conform not only to the Constitution but also the central laws.

3,SC stays further development of golf course in Goregaon,"MUMBAI: In a major boost to city environmentalists, the supreme court on Thursday stayed further development of a Rs 200-crore golf course on a 550-acre plot belonging to the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy group in Goregaon (west).

Residents of Andheri''s Lokhandwala complex and local activists had complained to the Union environment ministry that hundreds of acres of eco-sensitive mangroves were destroyed by the developers, who dumped tons of mud and debris to fill up the creek.

The Byramjee Jeejeebhoy group and Usha Madhu Development Cooperative Housing Society are jointly developing the 18-hole golf course.

The ministry had stayed the project when it found sufficient merit in the complaints received from citizens. The citizens had submitted photographic evidence to prove that large swathes of mangroves were chopped, a charge vehemently denied by the developers.

But in September 2003, a division bench of the Bombay high court headed by Justice V.G. Palshikar passed an ad interim order allowing work to continue. The developers had approached the high court after the environment ministry stalled the project.

The Bombay Environmental Action Group (BEAG) then filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the supreme court on the grounds that the Bombay high court had erred by permitting the developers to go ahead with the work.

""The petitioners submit that the impugned order is contrary to law, justice, equity and good conscience and deserves to be quashed and/or set aside,"" the BEAG said.

On Thursday, BEAG''s counsel Indu Malhotra told a supreme court bench that work should be halted because the ecology, once destroyed, cannot be restored.

The high court, in its ad interim order, had observed that the developer, will have to restore the land to its earlier state if it loses the case. But the apex court bench of Justice Ruma Pal and Justice S.B. Sinha agreed with the BEAG counsel''s contention and ordered that further development including that of reclaiming land and filling it up be stayed.

Last year, the environment ministry accused the developer of ""concealing facts and providing false information"" while submitting the golf course proposal Honda, truck around on accused scene arrested proposal to the ministry in 1995.

The ministry claimed that it was not aware of the existence of mangroves on the land when it approved the project in 1996. It further said that several reports, including satellite images, had subsequently proved that the developer had concealed information about the presence of mangroves at the site.

The ministry concluded that the plot fell in the intertidal zone covered by mangroves, hence classifiable as a Coastal Regulation Zone 1, where no reclamation, bunding or development is permitted.

The BEAG''s SLP observed that the high court judges had erred in admitting the developer''s petition and in exercising its equitable jurisdiction in favour of a party which had ""deliberately violated the law and made false representations to the Centre in order to obtain development permission.""

""Despite the expert scientific evidence and the location of the plot in the sensitive CRZ 1 zone, the high court has at the interim stage stayed the orders of the environment ministry and permitted the developer to continue filling and developing the plot,"" it said.

In November 2002, petroleum minister Ram Naik had invited the ire of environmentalists when he visited the golf course site. Although the minister claimed he visited the spot because it fell in his constituency, activists said Mr Naik had no locus standi in a matter that did not pertain to his ministry.

4,"PIL on bandh: HC issues notice to BJP, Shiv Sena","MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has issued notices to the BJP and the Shiv Sena in connection with a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by four prominent citizens and four daily-wage earners seeking compensation for the loss caused to them on the day of Mumbai bandh on July 30, 2003.

The court ordered the state government, the city police department and the two political parties to file their affidavits in reply to the PIL by February 4, and adjourned the matter till then.

The petitioners are former cabinet secretary B.G. Deshmukh, communications expert Alyque Padamsee, former police chief Julio Ribeiro, civic activist Gerson Da Cunha, motor mechanic Vinod Kumar, rickshaw driver Ayub Khan, shop worker Sabit Ali and security supervisor Sanser Singh.

The last four â€” daily-wage earnersâ€”were directly affected due to the bandh.

The PIL has sought the arrest, detention and prosecution of leaders who enforce such bandhs and departmental action against policemen who failed to control the mobs.

Relying on a Kerala high court judgment which banned bandhs, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, appearing for the petitioners, told the court on Wednesday that political parties and other large groups were breaking the law with impunity. He said it was an uphill task for the ordinary man to take on these powerful entities.

The Kerala court verdict was upheld by the supreme court. Mr Chinoy urged the HC to direct the state to ensure that the apex court order was implemented.

He said, ""Political parties indulging in flagrant violation of fundamental rights of citizens necessarily demands a remedy. Merely declaring that bandhs are illegal does not help.""

In a forceful submission made before a bench comprising Chief Justice C.K.Thakker and Justice S.A. Bobde, Mr Chinoy said, ""The essence of a civil society is recourse. But all recourse is lost because the ordinary man does not have the wherewithal to take on the might of big parties.""

He suggested that a bandh compensation fund can be set up so that people who lose a day''s wage can seek compensation from this fund. He added that the objective of the bandh is to stop production through coercion and violence.

The PIL said the bandh called by the Sena-BJP alliance threw normal life out of gear and caused a loss of Rs 50 crore to citizens.

It noted that the police did not attempt to detain those involved in disrupting rail and road traffic. The bandh call was given in the wake of a bomb blast in a BEST bus at Ghatkopar two days earlier.

5,EC gets tough with ministers 'campaign',"LUCKNOW: To prevent the repeat of Chiraigaon by-poll in Varanasi, where a large number of ministers were found to be violating the model code of conduct, the Election Commission has barred ministers from visiting Gunnaur constituency or adjoining areas under the pretext of official visits and indulging in blatant political activities to influence the course of the poll. The by-election for Gunnaur Assembly seat is taking place on January 24, from where chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is a candidate.

The instructions issued by the Election Commission clearly stops ministers from holding official meetings even in the neighbouring districts of the constituency where the by-poll is being held and the model code of conduct is in force. In the past, ministers, while being stationed outside the periphery where the model code of conduct was in force, had been found to be indulged in blatant political activities to influence the course of by-election, the EC said.

On the basis of the complaints received during the Chiraigaon bypoll, the EC said that more than half of the cabinet stationed itself in neighbouring districts on official work and from there carried out poll-related activities.

Keeping all this in view, the EC has directed that all the ministers whether from Central or the state, shall not combine in any manner their official tours with election work after the announcement of the by-elections. The ministers, EC said, should return to their headquarters on completion of their tours and any visit to the districts where by-election is taking place, had to be completely private in nature and such visits should begin and end at the headquarters.

It further said that in case where a minister travelling on official work passed through the district or districts, where by-election was being held en route to any other place on an official visit, he should not halt in the districts where the model code of conduct was in force and should not attend any political work.

No pilot cars with beacon lights of any colour affixed with sirens of any kind making their presence conspicuous should be used by the ministers during their visit to the constituency even if the state administration had granted them security cover, said the EC.

7,It's party time for Adinath depositors,"PUNE: The liquidator of the city-based Adinath co-operative bank has started the process of repaying money to the bank''s depositors following acceptance of the repayment claim by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).

Till now, the bank has repaid Rs 77.75 lakh to those who had kept deposits up to Rs 1 lakh in the bank, as they enjoy insurance cover from the DICGC.

Speaking to TNN on Thursday, Ashok Gade, Adinath bank liquidator and deputy district registrar in the department of co-operation, said as many as 5,500 depositors registered their claims.

""We have kept cheques ready to facilitate repayment till January 12,"" he said. Gade stated that the DICGC approved the claim of Rs 7.42 crore put in by the liquidator and gave permission for repaying insured deposits at the end of last month.

As many as 103 people had kept deposits in excess of Rs 1 lakh and approximately Rs 85 lakh would be required to repay them, he added. Asked about the recovery drive, Gade said the bank was recovering around Rs 10 to Rs 12 lakh from defaulters every month.

""Once we repay the 5,500 depositors, we will concentrate on the recovery drive,"" he said, adding that top defaulters would be served property attachment notices shortly to step up the recovery drive.

The Reserve Bank of India had cancelled the banking licence of Adinath co-operative bank on June 30, 2002, for failing to fulfil various economic criteria and high percentage of non-performing assets (NPA).

According to Gade, the NPA were to the tune of Rs 1.52 crore when the RBI took action against the bank. According to statistics available, there were over 9,000 depositors with the bank.

8,"Tougher rules for hawkers, vendors soon","PUNE: For the first time in the history of the Pune municipal corporation (PMC), the civic administration and party leaders have shown unanimity in their resolve to keep the roads free of encroachment from hawkers and vendors.

To make the anti-encroachment drives against hawkers and vendors more deterrent, municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar had issued orders in July last year to the civic staff that handcarts and other non-perishable items confiscated during such drives should not be returned even if the hawkers paid the fine of Rs 500.

Led by Baba Adhav, the hawkers had staged demonstrations outside the PMC building to protest against the decision, arguing that it was against their constitutional right to earn a living.

Mayor Dipti Chaudhari had then assured to return the confiscated goods, provided the hawkers'' union agreed to help the PMC to curb the number of hawkers in the city.

As per the rules finalised by the administration and cleared by the party leaders, henceforth confiscated handcarts will not be returned to hawkers unless they fulfil the following 10 norms:

Produce a domicile certificate or evidence that he/she is the resident of Maharashtra for the last 20 years â€” registration in the voters'' list, ration card, birth certificate or any other legal document will also do.

Evidence to show that he/she is operating as a hawker in Pune prior to 1995.

Submit details, including name, address, ration card copy and a photograph.

Vendors/hawkers should also attach an affidavit saying that the information supplied by them is true.

Only one handcart in a family will be returned, unless it is proved that the affected hawkers are not part of a joint family.

It will be mandatory on the hawkers/vendors to do business at the site specified by the PMC.

Hawkers/vendors should seek written permission from the PMC if they want to change their business.

Hawkers/vendors should do their business in such a manner that their business does not lead to encroachment on public thoroughfares.

The PMC will put a mark on the handcart to indicate that it was confiscated, besides painting on it the date and area in which the action was taken. This will help PMC to identify habitual offenders.

It will be the responsibility of the hawkers to collect the confiscated goods and handcarts from PMC storehouses by paying the fine. Complaints about tampering of goods and handcarts will not be entertained by the PMC.

9,Industry gets investment sops,"NEW DELHI: The new initiatives like abolition of special customs duty (SAD), and cuts in duties on project imports, coal, nickel, electricity meters and artificial limbs among others will encourage fresh investments, ushering in high growth.

S Madhavan, ED of PwC, said the reduction in customs duty on project imports from 25 per cent to 15 per cent would help create a favourable environment for new projects and expansion of existing capacities. He said the feel-good factor had further been consolidated.

A large number of companies into steel, cement, chemicals, consumer durables and non-durables are working at full capacity. As the economy is on the revival path, several of these are planning to expand capacities.

The new measures will bring down this cost and make them more efficient and competitive. This in turn will help consumers.

The decision to cut customs duty on imports of power transmission and distribution projects from 25 to 10 per cent will benefit the entire power sector, said CP Jain, CMD of NTPC.

He said the new measures would lead to lower generation and transmission costs. The measures will also boost NTPC''s investments.

Companies like Jindal Steel, which manufactures stainless steel, will benefit from the reduction in duty on nickel from 10 to 5 per cent. Arvind Parekh, finance director of Jindal Steel, said this would reduce cost of manufacturing of stainless steel by around 5 per cent.

Ernst and Young CMD KN Memani said the additional cost to the government by these measures without corresponding measures to raise revenue or reduce expenditure would increase the fiscal deficit, though this might partly be compensated by large collection of revenues through better compliance of taxes.

11,US Congress wants justice for riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: A four-member delegation of Congressmen from the United States who are camping in Ahmedabad, emphasised that alongwith initiatives for peace and harmony, prosecution of the perpetrators of violence should also be given importance.

The delegation was in Gujarat under the aegis of the All-India Christian Council (AICC).

Leader of the delegation, Joseph Pitts who represents Pennsylvania, told mediapersons on Friday that the delegation would now report to their colleagues in the Congress about â€œthe anti-conversion laws, treatment of dalits and anti-minority violence to be included in the country reports that are prepared on every countryâ€�.

Condemning the fact that people were discriminated against, Congressman Steve Chabot from Ohio compared the situation in Gujarat to that of Rwanda and remarked that the composition of Dalits in India was equal to the whole of the US population.

On Friday, the delegation visited Madninagar in Ramol, a rehabilitated settlement for riot victims built by the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind (JUH) and Gulbarg society, where â€œa fellow-parliamentarian was brutally murdered during the riotsâ€�, as Congressman Todd Achan put it.

Pitts dwelt on the provisions of the anti-conversion law recently implemented in Gujarat and its application to impinge on the freedom of faith and democracy.

â€œIt is strange to see this reversal of human rights in the land of the Mahatma Gandhiâ€�, Pitts remarked.

He said that the delegation would be meeting the government leaders to press for â€œprotection of minorities and that the Dalits have to live with the same rights as the restâ€�.

Earlier AICC secretary-general John Dayal said that the delegation of minorities had put some demands before the US delegation which were: Hastening the process of justice to riot victims and it protested against the institutionalisation of bigotry.

â€œOne of our demands is that there be reservations for minorities in the foreign companies that collaborated with Indiaâ€�, said Dayal. This delegation comprised AICC, JUH and the Confederation of SC/ST organisations.

12,Modi criticises government for not reserving posts,"PATNA: The issue of proposed appointment of 1,05,632 primary school teachers took a political hue on Friday with the leader of opposition in the state Assembly Sushil Kumar Modi claiming that the state government was yet to conduct examination to place about 25,000 primary school teachers appointed in 1994 in the regular payscale of Rs.4,500 to Rs.7,000.

Describing the state government announcement to appoint over one lakh primary school teachers a political stunt of the ruling RJD in view of the impending Lok Sabha elections, Modi said that the government did not have enough teachers'' training schools to train such a large number of teachers. As of now, Modi said, all the 60 teachers'' training schools had become defunct.

With regard to the proposed appointment of over one lakh primary school teachers, Modi said that the government took four years to advertise the 34,540 posts including 12,862 urdu teachers.

He said that the government had reserved 6,028 of the posts of urdu teachers for scheduled castes(SCs), scheduled tribes(STs) and other backward castes(OBCs) among Muslims even as there were no SCs and STs in the Muslim community while only about a dozen Muslim sub-castes had been included in the list of OBCs. Obviously, he said, there is a strong a possibility of these reserved posts remaining unfilled.

Modi lashed out at the government for not reserving any post for maithili and sanskrit teachers though they figure in the 8th schedule of the constitution.

With regard to the remaining 71,092 posts, Modi said that they were being appointed under centrally sponsored Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan with the centre bearing 75 per cent cost of their salary and Bihar government the rest 25 per cent.

He, however, said that the government should have filled up these posts two years back. The BJP leaders said that the state had been deprived of over Rs.816 crore sanctioned to it by the centre under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan during the past three years due to its failure to spend the Rs.303 crore released to it.

The government could spend only Rs.65 crore of this fund, he said. The state had also been deprived of another over Rs.325 crore central fund under district primary education pariyojna.

14,States agree to push reforms in farm marketing,"NEW DELHI: As the country heads into an election year, the Centre says most states have agreed to push agricultural marketing reforms, but are wary of the effects of land policy reforms.

After a meeting of state ministers on Wednesday, it appeared land policy reforms would be kept on the backburner, awaiting further discussion and consultations.

On Thursday, when agriculture minister Rajnath Singh indicated there could be further cuts in interest rates on farm loans and additions to a farmersâ€™ package,officials keen to get the corporate sector into agriculture counted the wins. States, they said, agreed to promote direct marketing and contract farming but remained chary of private markets.

Haryana suggested that private markets could be tried first for horticultural produce, agro-processing industries and promotion of exports. Punjab agreed to some of this through contract farming, not otherwise. One fear for such states is the loss of revenue from the countryâ€™s 7,200 regulated mandis which fetch between Rs 1,500-1,800 crore â€” much more, say officials, is siphoned.

Asking states to be ready with the new marketing system framework within a year, Rajnath Singh doled out reassurance on revenue loss. The reforms will plug misuse and theft of mandi tax and increase the volume of transactions so it shouldnâ€™t lead to a loss, he argued. If it does, states could find other means of raising revenue, he suggested.

On land policy, the Centre has been pushing for simpler land leases, the formation of land share companies so farmers can collectively mobilise resources and allotment of homestead-cum-garden plots to poor farmers and landless workers. The major fear here is the ownerâ€™s risk of losing land â€” fears voiced by states such as Karnataka.

This wouldnâ€™t happen, assured Singh, and leasing could be within the land ceiling limits of each state. Obviously, not everybody was convinced.

But officials say Maharashtra is already moving on creating the space for private markets. Kerala has framed a model marketing law and Orissa is discussing one. Gujarat has agreed to the bulk of the suggestions. Most states, indicated one official, have begun to make changes. This year, a bouquet of initiatives to lift government clamps, create facilities and open up the agriculture sector will be followed, later this month, by the inauguration of farmer information call centres and an agriculture TV channel.

What the Centreâ€™s model law on marketing broadly suggests is to let growers and local authorities establish new markets, not force growers to sell produce through the existing regulated markets, establish direct purchase centres and consumer/farmer markets for direct sale, regulate contract farming arrangements to link the small farm sector to profitable markets, promote agro-processing industries, encourage quality production and enforce this with a time-bound mechanism for dispute resolution, set up state marketing standards bodies, standardisation and quality certification

of produce.

15,Stamp scam: CBI arrests 3 RPF officials,"NEW DELHI/BANGALORE: The Central Bureau of Investigation has arrested three officials of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) for pilfering stamp papers from trains and selling them to the Telgi gang.

The stamp papers, bound for different destinations from the governmentâ€™s security press at Nashik, were stolen by the officials and taken to Abdul Karim Telgiâ€™s office in Mumbai.

Those arrested are V.R. Joshi, P.S. Dahake and V.J. More. A retired head constable, D.R. Warke, was also taken into custody. Their involvement came to the notice of the sleuths while they were investigating a case registered against Telgi and some RPF men. After stealing the stamp papers from the railway wagons, these officials had sold them to Telgi. The stolen stamp papers helped Telgi to print fake stamp papers. The CBI has gathered evidence that Telgi paid them for supplying the stamp papers. The investigators are searching the residences of the officials. The RPF men, who were arrested earlier for their collaboration with the stamp scam kingpin, are already in jail.

Meanwhile, the Karnataka legislative assembly was adjourned till Monday without transaction of official business on Friday as slogan-shouting BJP members disrupted the proceedings pressing for the arrest of former minister R Roshan Baig for his alleged links with the fake stamp paper scam, a demand the government rejected firmly.

As the House assembled, BJP members stretched their dharna for the second day vociferously demanding that Baig, who resigned as minister on Sunday, be arrested immediately and his properties confiscated.

After a duel of words between the Opposition and the government for about 45 minutes, with neither side budging, Speaker M V Venkatappa adjourned the House for a brief spell to facilitate negotiations but it failed.

Home minister M Mallikarjun Kharge, brushed aside the Opposition demand as â€˜â€˜politically motivated and a publicity stunt with an eye on the coming elections.â€™â€™
