6,President pats Paliganj farmers,"PALIGANJ (PATNA): Farmers of this small place had a unique and candid interaction with President A P J Abdul Kalam here on Saturday. Earlier, as the first scientific advisor to the Centre, Kalam had visited the place on October 28, 2000 and had interacted with the farmers on the use of new technology, HYV seeds and â€œzero tillageâ€�.

The farmers, who spoke on the occasion, and the President, who made a brief speech, recalled the October visit. The President said he still remembered how the farmers of Paliganj had taken pains to construct a motorable road for his car to reach their farms. The love of the Paliganj farmers was still alive in his memory, Kalam said.

Attaching tremendous significance to that visit, he said that he, along with scientist A K Singh, had worked, walked and shared their experiences with thePaliganj farmers, which was still vivid in his memory. Even at that time, many a people had expressed serious doubts over the success of such a venture in Bihar, which had now been proved wrong, the President said.

He said that he was at Paliganj to thank the farmers who had made Technology Information Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) experiment at Paliganj a great success. He said that Paliganj farmers had achieved an incredible success in bringing down the seed rate of paddy without affecting the plant population and yield of the crop.

The President showered praise on Paliganj farmers like Balmiki Sharma, Surendra Singh, B P Sinha and TIFAC scientist Gautam Goswami for making the TIFAC experiment at Paliganj a great success.

Kalam said that he was aware of the needs of Paliganj farmers who faced such problems as unavailability of warehousing, irrigation, marketing, road, telecommunication, technological know-how and chilling (cooling) plant facilities. He said that farmers here needed to be helped.

On being invited to put their questions and suggestions before him, four farmers raised the issues of not enough support price for paddy and wheat, besides lack of training for cultivation of medicinal plants, non-availability of procurement centres for their agricultural produce as well as lack of irrigation facilities and financial assistance. The President invited the four farmers to have knowledge about cultivation of medicinal plants in the Rashtrapati Bhavan garden.

Referring to minister for water resources Jagdanand Singh present on the dais, he said that he would advise the state government to arrange these facilities for the Paliganj farmers so as to achieve their empowerment.

The farmers, on the occasion, presented a shawl to the President. Their representative Balmiki Sharma, in his welcome speech, said that the shawl was purchased by the farmers from the money they had earned by selling their farm produce.

The President expressed heartfelt gratitude for showering their love and affection, and had a photo-session with them at Krishak Bhavan.

7,Cong puts Paragodu blame on govt,"HYDERABAD: Congress MLAs and other elected representatives from Anantapur district will stage a dharna in front of Secretariat here on June 7 in protest against the governmentâ€™s apathy towards the district. They will also bring pressure on the administration to take steps to prevent Karnataka from going ahead with the Paragodu and Nagalamadaka irrigation projects.

Disclosing this at a press conference on Saturday, PCC vice-president Gade Venkata Reddy said that a meeting of the Anantapur district Congress MLAs and DCC leaders was held at Gandhi Bhavan where it was unanimously resolved to support any action of the state government to stop the works at Paragodu and Nagalamadaka projects in Karnataka.

He alleged that the government did not act in time though it was well aware of the proposed Paragodu project. The state government officials gave their consent to the project at a meeting held in 2001 with their Karnataka counterparts and CWC officials, the party alleged.

J C Diwakar Reddy, who was also present at the press conference, said the dispute was between two states and between two political parties. Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had not even spoken to his counterpart S M Krishna on the issue and instead was blaming the Congress party, he said.

The government should have taken the initiative and put pressure on the NDA government to direct Karnataka to stop the project. The government failed to convene an all party meeting on the issue, he said. â€œIn what way is AICC president Sonia Gandhi concerned with these projects and how can she ask S M Krishna to stop the projects,â€� he asked. Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa could successfully solve the Cauveri dispute with Karnataka though she was not an ally of the NDA government or a friend of Congress, he recalled.

Legislators N Raghuveera Reddy, Y Sivarama Reddy, B Narayana Reddy, DCC president Venkat Ram Reddy and others were also present at the press conference.

8,2-second rule curbs mishaps,"HYDERABAD: While riding a motorcycle, road-users must stick to one of the most accepted rules of safety â€” the â€˜two-second ruleâ€™. That is the safe distance between a motorbike and the vehicle in front. Research has proved that if bikers follow the rule, the chances of hitting a vehicle in the front are reduced drastically.

Moreover, at high speeds, if this â€˜two-second ruleâ€™ is not followed, chances of hitting a vehicle in front or losing balance while trying to brake hard to avoid hitting another vehicle are very high.

Theory: It has been a well-documented fact that it takes an average person a full second to recognise and react to an unexpected threat and about another half-a-second if its anticipated. The â€˜two-second ruleâ€™, in other words, provides one full second of distance for one to stop after the rider reacts to an unexpected threat.

However, the vehicle ahead is not the only thing that the biker might have to avoid hitting and obstacles on the road must also be kept in mind and the rider must be alert.

Going down hill or riding on wet surfaces dramatically increases the stopping distance. In such cases, the â€˜two-second ruleâ€™ must be extended.

Further, since tyre traction is cut by as much as two-thirds on wet roads, clearly one should increase the â€˜two-second ruleâ€™ distance substantially over what is safe on dry level roads.

Similarly, sand or gravel-covered roadways should cause one to increase the distance.

9,Bribe charge: FIR cancelled against 2 lawyers,"UPDATE: After an investigation by the Chandigarh crime branch, the charges against the advocates were found to be false. The Chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Moga, has accepted the cancellation of the FIR against the two lawyers.

MOGA: A case of cheating and corruption has been registered against two advocates practising at the district courts here on the directions of additional district and sessions judge Jagmohan Chawla.Darshan Singh, a resident of Patti Wali Gali here, had alleged, in a complaint to senior judicial officers a few months ago, that he had engaged Vinay Kashyap as counsel to file a civil suit in a land dispute case a few years ago.

The complainant alleged that he had paid the amount to Kashyap and his brother Varinder , who is also a lawyer at Moga, who claimed to be close to the judge.Even though the lawyers gave an assurance that the money had been handed over to the judge, the appeal was dismissed in September 2002.When he asked the lawyers why the appeal had been dismissed, the lawyers put him off by saying that they would move the case to the high court for a favourable judgment.The lawyers, however, never filed an appeal in the high court nor did they return the money. This was when the litigant approached the district and sessions judge, Faridkot, AN Jindal, who directed the additional sessions judge, Moga, to look into the matter.Chawla recorded the statement of the complainant on May 28 and ordered registration of a case against the two lawyers.Mukhtiar Singh, station house officer, police station, city I, told Times News Network that a case under Section 420 IPC and 13,2 (88) of the Prevention of Corruption Act had been registered against the advocates.Varinder Kashyap, however, denied the charges and called it a conspiracy to tarnish his image as a lawyer.",UPDATE

11,"NDA Govt broke farm, public sector: Gowda","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (S) National President H D Deve Gowda on Saturday made a scathing attack on the NDA Government holding that their ''reckless policies'' grievously harmed the farmers and the public sector.

Addressing a rally in Thiruvananthapuram to mark the conclusion of the cross-state political campaign led by JD(S) state president M P Veerendra Kumar, Gowda said the NDA Government''s policies were instrumental for a huge rise in public debt and drove the farmers to commit suicide.

''The NDA Government destroyed the public sector and neglected the agricultural sector forcing the farmers to commit suicide. The public debt of the country has increased by $110 bn'' the former Prime Minister said.

The government''s policy was now stretched to the extent of corporatising natural resources, e said, adding that an international convention as part of the resistance movement would be held in Kerala shortly.

Veerendra Kumar said the campaign he started on May 18 from Kasargode in north Kerala was a first step towards making people aware of the dangers they were facing due to globalisation. ''If effective resistance is to be built, then these issues should be discussed at the mass level'', he added.

The State Government recently gave an undertaking to the Court that the area measuring 89.87 hectares in Shamshabad and Fatehabad, adjoining the monument, would be maintained as ''green zone'' and would not be converted into non-polluting light industrial zone.

This undertaking was given through Counsel Ajay Agarwal before a Bench comprising Justice M B Shah and Justice Arun Kumar following serious concerns shown by it towards the proposals which would have converted the adjoining areas of the 17th century monument built by Mughal emperor Shahjehan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.

The Court noted in its order that ""the State of UP undertakes that area measuring 89.87 hectares in Shamshabad and Fatehabad would be kept as ''green zone'' as previously notified and would not be converted into non-polluting light industrial zone.""

The undertaking further said that ""competent authority would take immediate steps for removal of any unauthorised construction at any place within that area.""

15,Assocham asks govt to set up national Biotech institutes,"NEW DELHI: Assocham has asked the Government to create Indian Institutes of Biotechnology (IIBTs) on the line of Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIITs) to promote biotechnology research in the country.

""Basic research in biological sciences has to be the pedestal on which biotechnology should be built and this must be distinguished from information technology as rules in biology are not universal,"" the Chamber said in a statement.

A mechanism should be evolved to re-engineer select national laboratories to upgrade their status to Indian Institutes for Biotechnology where industrial research and academic work would go hand-in-hand, it said.

It stressed on the need for enlarging human resource base in specialised areas of biotechnology and in transdisciplinary areas of convergence between biology, IT and engineering.

The estimated acreage of transgenic crops for 2002 has grown about 12 per cent to 58.7 million hectares in 16 countries, it said, adding, a sustained growth of more than 10 per cent per year has been achieved for the past eight years.

Despite the moratoria on GM crops in EU countries, 16 million farmers took up GM crops, it said, adding, three-fourths of them were small farmers in developing countries.

Government should permit biotech industry to utilise facilities, infrastructure and human resources of publicly funded institutions on attractive terms and encourage R&D programmes.

To give necessary support to biotechnology, IPRs and patent offices should also be modernised, it added.

18,Mayawati might curtail foreign tour to save govt,"LUCKNOW: With Uttar Pradesh in for another round of political instability after withdrawal of RLD support to the BSP-BJP government, Chief Minister Mayawati might cut short her five-nation tour abroad and rush to the state capital if the political situation so ""warrants.""

The chief minister is in constant touch with party leaders and officials of the state in the wake of RLD''s withdrawal of support and the opposition bid to unite, party sources said.

""So far her tour is on,"" they said, adding, however that as the political situation is fluid, the visit could be curtailed ""if necessary.""

An indication to this effect also came from senior BJP leader Lalji tandon, when he said that she (Mayawati) could cut short her visit.

Sources admitted that Mayawati''s absence had come as a ""blessing in disguise"" for the opposition and apprehend that their attempt to destabilise the government could gather momentum in the next few days.

Mayawati''s mere presence instils confidence both in the official machinery as well as in party circles, they said citing how she had successfully thwarted the previous bid to topple her government when several independent MLAs had withdrawn support to her government.

The carrot and stick policy adopted by the chief minister to contain activities to dislodge her government have paid rich dividends'', they maintain.
