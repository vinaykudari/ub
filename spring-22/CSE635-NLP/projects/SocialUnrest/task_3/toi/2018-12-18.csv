0,Women's groups oppose law panel recommendations,"mumbai: women's organisations are up in arms against the law commission of india (lci) recommendations on the review of rape laws. about 30 organisations working on issues related to women and children's rights as well as rights of the sexual minority groups held a three- day national meet to debate the issue that recently blazed the big screens through the real life-based film bawandar. the law commission recommendation to broaden the definition of rape to include sexual assault other than just peno-vaginal penetration was welcomed by the women's groups as it was their longstanding demand. but the activists were unanimous in their criticism of the lci for excluding marital rape from the sexual assault laws. apporva kaiwar of forum against oppression of women, mumbai, said the recommendation of lci to make rape laws ""gender neutral'' was strongly opposed and it was felt that there should be a separate law to deal with child sexual abuse. however, the dropping of section 155 of the indian evidence act which probed the past history of the victim was a welcome move, the activists avered. among the resolutions passed at the meeting included the demand to the lci to consider the needs of the women groups and ""initiate an extensive national dialogue with all groups working on women and child rights and rights of sexual minorities before framing any new laws or recommending changes in the existing ones.'' demanding that rape laws retain their gender specific flavour, ms kaiwar said, ""we are opposed to gender neutrality in rape laws except in case of child sexual abuse for, in a patriarchal society, it would work against the right of women and sexual minorities.'' what the activists fear is that gender neutrality will for the first time acknowledge the existence of sexual minorities and, in the absence of any positive recognition for sexual minorities like anti-discrimination laws, framing of same sex assault laws could be abused. the lci had recommended framing of same sex assault laws. the women's groups also outlined the need for child-friendly procedures and different definitions for punishment in case of child sexual abuse. they also demanded the repeal of section 377 of the indian penal code as it was ""moralistic'' and made all sexual acts other than peno-vaginal penetration unlawful. ""this law is widely used to harass and intimidate sexual minority groups and in a sense criminalises them,'' the resolution stated. the other demands included in the resolution were that the onus of proof be shifted on the accused and that trials be made time-bound. it was also demanded that `hijras', who are not recognised by the constitution, but suffer a lot from male rape, be considered as women under gender specific sexual assault laws. senior criminal law counsel p.r. vakil noted that definition of rape as it stood today did not require any more improvement as it covered all aspect relating to commission of rape. he, however, said that punishment for attempt to rape could be enhanced as already provided for attempt to murder which was imprisonment for life. he also noted that what was needed was a ""genuine, independent and thorough investigation as was being done in, for instance, cheating cases instead of starting with the premise that the accused is guilty.'' he recalled how, as a public prosecutor, he had come across several cases of false accusations being made. the delay in courts and the alarming rise in commission of rape in the society, however, is a cause for concern. keeping this in mind, a division bench of the bombay high court headed by justice vishnu sahai had held in april this year that, to curb the rapidly increasing commission of such cases of rape and to sustain the faith of the common man in relationships and the courts, a deterrent sentence was necessary. the court had sentenced a 60-year-old man to five years' imprisonment for attempted rape of a nine-year-old 19 years ago. the judges had noted that the accused had behaved in an ""absolute depraved and despicable manner to satisfy his perverted sexual lust'' and attempted to rape the nine-year-old. ""what makes his act all the more revolting is that he cheated her confidence,'' as she had accompanied him in good faith only to be victim of sexual assault. ""in our view, if a soft-pedalling policy in the matter of sentence is adopted by courts in such cases, not only their recurrence would increase but people would lose faith in courts.'' the women's groups and the victim of such a heinous crime as rape could not agree more with the court that that would be very distressing indeed.

3,No decision on development employees,"bathinda: the fate of hundreds of staff members of district rural development agencies (drda) in punjab hangs in limbo as a committee, constituted under the chairmanship of chief secretary, to give its recommendation on their absorption into government departments could not submit its report so far. while the state governor had directed the committee to give its recommendation within a period of three months on august 8, 2000, the committee failed to complete the report. drda employees had threatened self-immolation during the visit of the then union minister for agriculture to kaljharani village on june 14 last year, and the punjab chief minister had agreed to the inclusion of drda staff in state government departments and issued a notification in november last year, but so far nothing has been done according to sadhu ram kusla, chairman of all-india drda staff welfare association. he said that all the employees working in drda all over the state were governed by the union government, but they were deprived of all post-service and retirement benefits as they were not regular employees. he said employees who had been working for the past 30 years in the central funded programme for effective implementation of the anti-poverty programme and coordinating with other agencies were still facing uncertainty.

4,‘No entry’ to ministers in Asifnagar,"hyderabad:while the inaugurations and foundation stone laying ceremonies in the city are turning into political meetings, the same are being held in a low-key manner in the asifnagar constituency. with congress mla d nagender asking the ministers not to visit his constituency, only the middlelevel officials of various departments like hyderabad metropolitan water supply & sewerage board (hmws&sb) and municipal corporation of hyderabad (mch) are accompanying the mla. the hmws&sb has been sanctioned rs 27 crore for improving drinking water and sewerage systems in the city and each assembly constituency has been allocated rs 1 crore for such works. speaking to the times of india, nagender accused the ministers of diverting the public attention from the real problems and instead campaigning for the telugu desam party. they have no business to visit constituencies other than their own. the respective mla can look after the programmes. i have strictly warned ministers not to visit my constituency, he said. nagender along with some officials has laid foundation stones for sewerage lines at adarshnagar, phoolbagh, netajinagar, kattal mandali, vijayanagar colony and other localities to be taken up at an estimated cost of rs 85 lakh. according to him, of the nine municipal divisions in his constituency, the congress would comfortably win six. currently, he is locked in a argument with the ap housing board officials who are demanding more money from the 300 families to whom houses were allotted 30 years ago near bhoiguda kaman. housing to the poor is top priority on my list.the then government has asked the board to collect nominal amount from the poor. now, the officials are asking them to pay the current market value which is unfair, he said. nagender told the housing board officials that the poor cannot pay the revised amounts. he also also staged a dharna at the housing board office in this regard. the congress would focus on secular credentials in the mch elections and would highlight the 'anti-people' policies of the state and central governments, he added.

5,TSS rules out pact with TRS for MCH polls,"hyderabad: the telangana sadhana samithi (tss) has ruled out any pact with the telangana rasthra samithi (trs) for the municipal corporation of hyderabad (mch) elections. the tss leaders said trs president k chandrasekhara rao had asked the tss to merge with his party and refused to recognise the tss as a political party. is there any basis for his demand. tss president a narendra has a following in the city and tss is a force to reckon with, said senior tss leaders. tss city unit president m govind giri said the party desires to work with other organisations floated with the objective of securing statehood for telangana. the trs has lost public patronage and many leaders who joined chandrasekhara rao have left the trs and joined the tss following his adamant attitude, he said. however, the tss is yet to hold talks with various parties for the elections.the momentum will pick up once the notification is issued. we are yet to decide. it is too early to finalise candidates, govind giri said. former minister and tss leader gutha mohan reddy pointed out that chandrasekhara rao lacked commitment and cannot sustain the movement. leaders of various outfits should come together to secure statehood for telangana. he behaves like a dictator and will not take anyone into confidence. such a person cannot become a good leader, he said. meanwhile, trs leaders, confirming their demand for a merger with the tss, have said they are ready to work in association with 'like-minded' parties. narendra wants to be made president of the organisation in case the tss is merged with the trs. such a thing will not happen. trs was launched long ago and it contested the local body polls. it has been recognised by the people, trs city-unit president m sudharshan rao said. the trs leaders said that tss cannot win the mch elections as muslims are opposed to narendra as he belonged to bjp earlier. the tss may cut into some bjp votes and cannot damage the prospects of trs, rao added.

6,Fluorosis victims lament govt indifference,"kodad:the problem of fluorosis may be severe in gondriala village in kodad mandal of nalgonda district, but an estimated 1.5 lakh people in 35 other habitations in the area are no strangers to its ill-effects. spread over the mandals of kodad, nadigudem, munagala and chilkur, these habitations have water with high fluoride content. this causes dental and skeletal fluorosis, in many cases crippling people. what people in these villages are angry about is the indifference of the authorities to their suffering.how long should we continue to suffer like this?'' asks gadara sanjeeva rao of nallagondagudem village in kodad mandal. to provide clean and safe drinking water and permanently solve the problem in this region, the state government had prepared a project report that envisaged a solution at a cost of a mere rs 10.8 crore a few years ago. the report, however, has been in cold storage since then. people are suffering due to dental and skeletal fluorosis. many have been crippled, affecting their families economically,'' a former engineerin-chief of the panchayati raj department stated, underlining the urgency of implementing the safe drinking water project. the project report was submitted to the government of india on may 31, 1997 for clearance. a team of officials from the central and state governments inspected all the areas proposed to be covered under the project in june 1997. following the inspections certain modifications were suggested in the plan. according to the revised plan, two schemes will make use of the voilsingaram and madharam tanks, fed by the nagarjunasagar reservoir, to supply safe drinking water to the fluorosis-affected habitations. from the original cost of rs 13.14 crore, the cost of the project was revised to rs 10.8 crore. the government is taking no initiative to implement the madharam reservoir drinking water project,'' alleges sq ldr n uttam kumar reddy (retd.), the congress legislator from kodad. if people are suffering now, even the congress governments of the past are to be blamed. it is a shame that no government has done anything to bring about a solution to the fluorosis problem,'' the mla says.

8,‘Punjab govt biased against PU’,"chandigarh: the state of finances pertaining to higher education in punjab appears to be in a shambles, if academicians are to be believed. to compound the problem, punjab university teachers allege that the punjab government is biased against pu. the genesis of the bias, they allege, goes back to a letter that the punjab government bureaucrats wrote to all three universities in punjab in 1998-1999 asking universities to generate their own resources through fee and fund hikes. punjabi university and guru nanak dev university agreed. panjab university did not. pu has an elected senate and syndicate while gndu and punjabi university have nominated decision-making bodies. ''nominations are done by the government. obviously they agreed,'' pointed out a pu senator, and alleged that pu's stand rubbed the bureaucrats the wrong way. following student protests against fee hikes in 1999 and 2000, pu decided to raise the fee by only 20 per cent the first year and 10 per cent each subsequent year instead of the fivefold hike asked for by the bureaucracy. the government had proposed that the fee be hiked by five times and then again by five times after a gap of two years. gndu and punjabi universities also did not impose a fee hike in their colleges, though they did increase the fee on campus courses. the 95 per cent grant-in-aid at the 1999-2000 levels was rs 72 crore for private aided colleges. the grants for the following years were not raised beyond this level. pu got rs 16 crore that year and even that amount has since remained static. the accumulated arrears of grants for the colleges, according to pu senator ps sangha, are rs 100 crore now. ''this pending grant is also one of our major demands.we want it released,'' he said. however, teachers have been alleging that the government is not paying even the said grant-in-aid and has imposed an ''illegal'' cut on the funds. ''the punjab finance department has stated that they would reduce the grant-in-aid to 50 per cent.they do not have the concurrence of the assembly or the council of ministers to do so. ''the fee hike issue in the colleges is also pending with the cabinet. they are scared to take a decision because of the approaching elections,'' said pu senator charanjit chawla. if the colleges decide to make up the rs 100 crore shortfall through fee hikes as the government is goading them to, the fees for the different courses would go up by three times, say college teachers. they say that the ba fee would go up from the present rs 5,000 to rs 15,000. for b com it would go up from rs 6,000 to rs 18,000 and for bsc it would go up from rs 6,200 to rs 20,000. ''can parents pay such fees? what about poor rural youth? are we forgetting our socialist ideology? this is a dangerous move by the government. it is a step backward for higher education. it is the governments problem to meet the needs of higher education. they cant simply pass on the responsibility to us,'' said principal, sd college, sector 32,ac vaid.

10,Pointsman of Jaish leader is arrested,"new delhi: tariq, a key link between jaish-e-mohammad sup-reme commander in india ghazi baba and the quartet held in delhi for the parliament attack, was arrested in srinagar on monday. in delhi, the police recovered over 35 kg of explosives from the mukherjee nagar hideout as the investigations continued at many levels and many places. tariq was the link between ghazi baba and afzal and syed a r gilani, the delhi university lecturer. delhi police chief ajai raj sharma had claimed on sunday that tariq, a close accomplice of ghazi baba, was the one who motivated afzal for joining the suicide attack on parliament. ''tariq used to pass information to afzal and mediate between afzal and ghazi baba, who is based in kashmir,'' an official said on monday. sources said that more raids may be carried out in srinagar and some other places in the valley. a special cell team has been positioned in srinagar to await further orders. in delhi, throughout monday, the police used the services of software experts from a renowned firm to retrieve the data stored in the laptop the terrorists had left behind. the laptop and rs 10 lakh in cash were confiscated from mohammad afzal and shaukat hussain when they were arrested in kashmir. the calls made and received in their cellphones were also being traced. till late evening, the police, however, refused to share any details of the findings. the police also took into custody landlord subhash malhotra and property dealer devinder kapoor. they were charged with not providing information on new tenants, as is required by a police order. ''afzal had taken malhotra's house on rent a month before the attack,'' an officer said. the arrested militants, shaukat hussain and mohammed afzal and du lecturer syed gilani, were, meanwhile, questioned by the officials of the intelligence bureau, research and investigation wing (raw) and detectives from the special cell. the idea was to check if some of their accomplices are still at large in the city. the trio were later taken to the hospital to identify the bodies of the five militants who had attacked parliament. the bodies had been sent to the sucheta kriplani hospital for autopsy. sources said a motorist, whose vehicle was allegedly hit by the terrorists' white ambassador just before the attack on thursday, was also taken to the hospital to identify the bodies. in the premises of the parliament house, security agencies conducted a drill. this was the first such exercise since thursday's attack. sources said the drill involved repositioning of certain pickets which had been captured on camera during the crossfire.

11,Insult at school drives child to attempt suicide,"pune: in a rare incident of its kind in the city, a standard viii student of the maharashtra education society-run vimalabai garware school tried to commit suicide on friday by immolating himself after he had been ""insulted"" by a school teacher during a drill class. the chattushrungi police have registered a case of abetment to suicide against the teacher. according to the complaint lodged by the mother of 15-year-old vinod jadhav, the school teacher castigated vinod for alleged misbehaviour and abused him in front of the assembled students. the teacher also made some casteist remarks, it is alleged. returning home in the evening, vinod narrated the incident to his mother who rushed to the school to question the teacher. vinod tried to immolate himself after his mother had left. he was badly burnt and has been admitted to a private hospital for treatment. vinod's father subhash says his son is known to be talkative but ruled out unruly behaviour on his part. when contacted, anil dhekne, secretary, mes, said that he was shocked and did not expect a small incident to take such a gory turn. he, however, vehemently denied that the teacher used foul language or made casteist remarks.

12,Badal asks partymen to work unitedly,"chandigarh: chief minister prakash singh badal has urged partymen to sink their differences and strive unitedly for an sad-bjp alliance victory in the coming vidhan sabha elections. addressing party workers from bathinda and mansa districts at his residence on monday, the chief minister said he would personally apologise for any act of indiscretion committed by any of his ministers or any other party leader which might have caused rancour. he said there should not be any bitterness among party leaders and they should not indulge in any under cutting of votes to settle personal scores. all should work in unison in the interest of the party he said, adding that the alliance stood a good chance of being voted back to power. he said the alliance would seek positive votes on the strength of its achievements during the past five years. the chief minister said his government had done much more during its five years' tenure than what the congress could had in its 40 years of rule. he criticised the congress for working against the interests of the state and harming the cause of the sikhs. the congress, he said, had always sought to exploit the sikh vote bank with an ulterior motive of capturing power.but operation bluestar and the anti-sikh riots showed that the party never really protected their interests. the congress, in fact, harped on communal divide and created social tensions. speaking on the occasion, rajya sabha member balvinder singh bhunder exhorted party workers to start preparing for the elections in right ernest. he said the party faced a stiff challenge from the propaganda unleashed by the congress in an effort to malign the ruling alliance.

13,CPI-M to withdraw support to Maharashtra govt,"mumbai: the communist party of india-marxist on tuesday said it would withdraw support to the democratic front government in maharashtra due to ""its anti-people policies"" and quit from the coordination committee, the decision-making body of the eight-party coalition. a formal announcement to this effect will be made on december 26 during the party's 17th state-level conference, party's state unit secretary prabhakar sanzgiri told reporters here. however, the party, which has two members in the state legislature, would extend issue-based support to the government, he added. ""two years ago our party had extended its support to the df government with a view to keeping shiv sena-bjp alliance out of power"", he said. ""the earlier sena-bjp government had increased the debt burden on the state tremendously by announcing outrageous schemes and the present df government is transferring all the burden to the people"", he alleged, adding the government also developed cold feet in implementing recommendations of srikrishna and gundewar commissions. on the party's decision to withdraw from the coordination committee, sanzgiri said, ""the committee has no place in decision making process and its credibility is eroding."" he said the party has also appealed to pwp, janata dal (secular) and samajwadi party to take a similar decision.

14,All-party meeting today to discuss attack,"new delhi: under attack from the opposition for not taking it into confidence on a matter of such import, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee has called an all-party meeting to discuss the attack on parliament and the government's next course of action. bjp sources said on tuesday that vajpayee was likely to meet leaders of all opposition parties some time on wednesday. earlier in the day, vajpayee told a bjp parliamentary party meeting that the government would talk to its allies and opposition parties and the process had already begun. the sources said the prime minister was referring to a meeting he had with senior congress leader and leader of opposition in rajya sabha dr manmohan singh at his 7 race course residence on monday. the congress, however, continued to breathe fire on tuesday saying five days after the attack on parliament, the government was yet to make any attempt to involve the opposition. party spokesman jaipal reddy denied any knowledge of vajpayee's meeting with singh, who had been present till late monday evening at a congress meeting. reddy also criticised home minister l.k. advani's statement on the attack in the lok sabha on tuesday, accusing him of ""deliberately concealing more and revealing little."" he pointed out that advani had failed to mention that 30 kg of rdx were discovered in the terrorists' car, had not explained how it had passed through so many layers of security without a parliament sticker and had also not talked about how he had prior information that there could be a terrorist attack on parliament. the left also criticised the statement with senior communist party of india (marxist) leader somnath chatterjee saying there was nothing new in it. he too picked holes in the statement during the debate, and regretted that the opposition had to cull all its information from media reports. in a rare show of solidarity, however, the government and opposition seem to have agreed to put contentious issues aside and end the winter session on a note of unity. bjp sources said the pm was agreeable to such an arrangement. cpi(m) leader nilotpal basu said with indications from the government that it was ready to set aside acrimonious issues, the opposition would also not raise its issues in parliament on the remaining three days of session, though its demand for the resignation of defence minister george fernandes and its opposition to poto still remained. the fate of the controversial poto, thus, still hangs, with the bill unlikely to come up for ratification in this session now. the bjp is now favouring repromulgation once it lapses.

15,Terror law invoked against 4 in attack case,"new delhi: delhi police on tuesday invoked the provisions of controversial anti-terrorism ordinance poto against four persons arrested in connection with the terrorist attack on parliament. the four persons -- mohammad afzal, a r geelani, shaukat hussain and his wife afshan -- arrested for conspiracy in the december 13 attack have been booked under the prevention of terrorism ordinance, although initially the case was registered under other laws, delhi police commissioner ajai raj sharma told reporters here on tuesday. sharma also said that afzal, shaukat and geelani had told delhi police during interrogation that mohammad, leader of the jaish-e-mohammad suicide squad, was involved in the 1999 hijacking which ended with release of three dreaded terrorists, including masood azhar who later formed jaish-e-mohammad. mohammad was identified by the three arrested persons as 'burger', one of the five hijackers, he said. the information has been passed on to cbi to investigate it as the hijacking case is being probed by it, sharma said. he denied reports that tariq, a close associate of jem leader ghazi baba who planned the attack, has been arrested. the jammu and kashmir police has arrested tanveer, also a terrorist, and he is not connected with this case, he said, adding tariq was still at large and efforts were on to nab him.

16,Raichur looks up to Raja Naik the minister,"raichur: it was a contest too close to call. finally, kalmala legislator raja amaresh naik made it to the two-year-old krishna government as minister of state in monday's cabinet expansion. naik has been awarded the horticulture department, hitherto held by social welfare minister kagodu thimmappa after allum veerabhadrappa quit the cabinet some time ago. the district of raichur has sent three congress legislators to the karnataka legislative assembly in the 1999 elections. ever since the congress high command chose not to award berth to any legislator from raichur district, there had been a clamour that at least one of the legislators from the district be inducted into the cabinet. since no cabinet expansion was undertaken all these days, the memoranda and appeals did not have any effect. that was somewhat compensated, to a small extent albeit, when the krishna regime dexterously appeased certain regions of the state in appointments to boards and corporations. during such an exercise, manvi legislator n.s. bhosraj landed the much-envied post of president of the hyderabad-karnatak development board, besides being the president of the district unit of the party. also pricked them is the fact that the neighbouring gulbarga district had not just one or two but five representatives in the cabinet that included the plum portfolio of home being bagged by senior-most leader mallikarjuna m. kharge. the only hitch, if any, was that two of the three congress legislators from the district -- bhosraj and syed yasin representing raichur city -- were first-timers. and raja amaresh naik had only managed to cast a spell on the party high command with his stupendous victory twice. chief minister s.m. krishna, during a visit to the region, had made a grandiose promise of accommodating one of the raichur legislators in the cabinet. a promise that he has lived up to. but the period of gestation between the promise and delivering it, was excruciatingly painful for the legislator trio. for, bhosraj was said to have wielded enough influence on party satraps in the karnataka unit of the congress to land the cabinet berth. it was also common knowledge in the district that bhosraj was pulling out all stops to placate the party higher-ups, a task that failed to pay dividends. syed yasin, by virtue of being a muslim leader and having contributed to the all-round development of the district as a social worker much before his stint as legislator, was said to be a hot favourite. also, many of his followers had reportedly embarked on the delhi yatra to impress upon congress president sonia gandhi for a berth to yasin. that drew a blank. raja amaresh naik, actively promoted by the valmiki samaj which had submitted a memorandum to the chief minister during a visit here, belongs to the scheduled tribe. also, naik is the chief whip of the congress in the assembly. it was naik who was finally handpicked for the coveted post. and expectations from him for the district are high.

18,Farmers' rally was political stunt: Rai,"mangalore: the farmers' jatha held recently by the bharatiya janata party has come under severe criticism by minister for ports and fisheries b. ramanath rai. terming the rally ``a political stunt'', rai said it was an act by the bjp to cover up the failure in the recent puttur and sullia polls. he told reporters here on tuesday that the bjp was trying to gain political mileage by organising such programmes and trying ``desperately to put the krishna government in bad light''. the party is also trying to cover up the miserable failures of the union government on all fronts, he added. citing examples of various schemes implemented by the state government to support the fisherfolk in the state, rai said despite the initiative taken by the state government to exempt sales tax on 50,000 kilo litres of diesel for fishing activities, similar initiative was not forthcoming from the centre. the state has also brought down the tax rates from 12 per cent to four for ice plants which has further helped the industry, he added. it may be recalled that at the recent padayatra of farmers organised by the bjp, a list of demands including the withdrawal of four per cent sales tax and apmc cess of two per cent on areca with immediate effect; provision of uninterrupted power for 12 hours and retention of tariffs for pumpsets for areca growers at the present rate of rs 300 per hp, were made. rai said that the reduction of sales tax for areca alone would not solve the problem as a similar reduction introduced in the state of kerala had not yielded the desired result. the union government will have to intervene and come out with constructive programmes to reduce the imports of areca and also consider an increase in import duties of up to 300 percent if the areca growers were to be benefited.

22,"CM, Oppn clash on DJB corruption","new delhi: in a bid to corner chief minister sheila dikshit on the issue of corruption, the bharatiya janata party legislators pushed an adjournment motion to discuss the lokayukta probe report on delhi jal board on the first day of the winter session. while the discussion lasted for barely 15 minutes, the verbal exchange between the opposition and the ruling congress vacillated from corruption in the jal board, recent terrorist attack on the parliament and irregularities in the coffin deal involving union defence ministry. the debate ended with the bjp members staging a walkout and dikshit combating the opposition's move by listing out scams and scandals involving the bjp. ''after the coffin scam and attack on the parliament, the bjp has no moral authority to discuss corruption at any level,'' dikshit said. leader of opposition jagdish mukhi alleged that the government was corrupt and defunct and any allegations proven by the lokayukta in the jal board case amounted to direct indictment of dikshit in the corruption scam. he said to prove charges against junior engineers was not the purpose of the lokayukta and there were various vigilance departments to conduct enquiry against junior officials. ''by indicting these officials, the lokayukta meant to indict the jal board and in turn dikshit, who is the chairperson of the board,'' he said. visibly belligerent, the bjp mlas staged a walkout after it lost out to chief minister sheila dikshit in the subsequent sparring match. to shorten the discussion, speaker prem singh asked dikshit to give her explanatory remarks immediately after mukhi's opening speech on the issue. the bjp mlas, who wanted to continue the discussion retaliated to the speaker's decision. while bjp legislator sahib singh chauhan was marshalled out, his party colleagues walked out in protest. former congress mla jagdish anand who was a complainant in the jal board case was also expelled from the house for disrupting the proceedings of the house. reacting sharply to mukhi's remarks, dikshit said by raising doubts on the probe conducted by the lokayukta, the leader of opposition had hit out at the integrity of the lokayukta. ''the report does not directly or indirectly indict me, my family or my staff. bjp does not understand this and insists that i am involved in it. they are casting doubts on the recommendations of the lokayukta,'' she said. she, however, assured that departmental action would be taken against those named by the lokayukta in the corruption in djb.
