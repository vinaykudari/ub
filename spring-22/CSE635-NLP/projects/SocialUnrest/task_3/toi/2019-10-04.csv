0,Nagrik Samaj protests Central ordinance,"LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Nagrik Samaj organised a demonstration in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue in the city on Wednesday, to protest the amendment to the Representation of Peopleâ€™s Act as directed by the Supreme Court. The former DGP IC Dwivedi who led the demonstrators, tore up copies of the Central governmentâ€™s ordinance.

Terming the ordinance as deceptive, farcical and anti-people, Dwivedi said that the Government of India had deceived the people by getting a toothless and grossly inadequate ordinance promulgated under the guise of a so-called consensus amongst political parties.

The speakers said that the ordinance prevented the Election Commission from asking for crucial details from candidates. They said that unless the purity and transparency of the electoral process was restored, the political system could not be made accountable and free from corruption. People from different walks of life such as freedom fighters, doctors, jurists, engineers and retired Army and civil personnel participated in the demonstration.

1,3 more arrested for plotting to kill Modi,"RAJKOT/SURAT: In an unusually swift crackdown, sleuths of the Ahmedabad city crime branch and Rajkot police early on Thursday morning picked up three people including Sikander Suleiman Sanghar, son of a local political leader and his friends Abdul Ghaffar Parmar and Munaf Baloch on charges of helping, and providing shelter to people involved in terrorist activities in the state.

According to the police, the police team from Ahmedabad came and picked up these people from the Sadar area. The police said these people were closely involved with the prime accused in the constable murder case Samirkhan Sarfarazkhan Pathan who is said to have trained under the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist network and given the task of eliminating Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

This development takes the total number of arrests to 12 in the case.

The Ahmedabad police team was led by crime branch DCP Vanzara and included police inspector HP Agravat, and two vehicle-load of policemen. Vanzara told TNN that the arrests were made after their names cropped up during interrogation of Samirkhan by the Ahmedabad police.

Samirkhan is said to have told his interrogators that he had stayed in Rajkot for a month and that Sanghar and Parmar had provided them all facilities during his stay in Rajkot. The police also said that â€œthe members of the terrorist organisations had also taken photographs of the Rajkot Swaminarayan temple on Kalawad road.â€�

Meanwhile, the Surat city police will send a team of officials on Friday to Ahmedabad to assist the crime branch there in its investigations into reported Surat-based links of Samirkhan Pathan, who was nabbed by the Ahmedabad police some days ago under the conspiracy charge to kill Modi.

Additional commissioner of police Ashish Bhatia told TNN that Pathan, with reported links with Pakistan-based terrorists outfits, allegedly had networks in several parts of the state including Surat and to ascertain the facts, team of police officials from Surat would go to Ahmedabad.

Bhatia, however, said that so far nothing conclusive could be said about Pathanâ€™s links in Surat. Only after interrogations, could anything be ascertained, he said. It has been reported that Pathan had come to Surat in March this year and his having met some locals here could not be ruled out. But only investigations could provide a lead, Bhatia said.

Based on investigations, if required, a case would be registered against Pathan and then only he could be brought here, Bhatia told TNN Suleiman Sanghar who is a former Congressman, has pleaded for his sonâ€™s release and said that Sikander was not involved in any terrorist activities and so far not a single police case has been filed against him. â€œIn fact he is a sportsman and played for Saurashtra.â€�

Sanghar however said that â€œsix-seven months ago there was a house in the name of Sikander in Sadar area and it was empty. Out of that, a room was given to Samirkhan, who had identified himself as Salmankhan then. Samir alias Salman had told Sikander that his family would join him in a weekâ€™s time and when it did not happen he was asked to vacate the house by Sikander.â€�

Samir is also said to have played a key role in the kidnapping of jeweller sons Bhaskarâ€”Paresh and also with another known terrorist Aftab Ansari.

2,Unite against govt: Cong,"HYDERABAD: Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Thursday called upon all opposition parties to unitedly launch a movement against the government for its failure to come to the rescue of drought-hit farmers.

Participating in a dharna organised by the AP Rythu Sangham, he said the opposition parties could build a strong movement against the World Bank policies adopted by the government and pressurise it for expeditious completion of the pending irrigation projects.

â€œGiven the indifference of the government in mitigating the problems faced by farmers in the drought-affected areas, the opposition parties are left with no other option but to launch a sustained movement. We should set aside the small issues and join forces in taking up the agitational path which is the only solution to the problem,â€� he said, assuring the communists of all cooperation from the Congress if they come forward.

Launching a blistering attack on the government, Reddy said that the wrong policies of the government on power and poor managem ent of available water have resulted in severe losses to farmers who were already badly hit by the drought.

â€œMore than the inadequate rainfall, the crops in several areas have dried up due to the governmentâ€™s inefficiency,â€� he said.

3,Indian giant squirrel facing extinction?,"NEIL PATE

PUNE: Human interference and â€œdevelopmentâ€� activities near forest areas might soon force the state animal of Maharashtra and pride of Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary â€” the Indian Giant Squirrel (Ratufa indica elphinstoni) to join the list of extinct animals.

Commonly known as Shekru in Marathi, the giant squirrel is the star attraction at the 130.78 sq.km. Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary. Although its population has remained constant (700 only) for the past two decades, forest officials and wildlife activists are concerned over the increasing human interference and â€œdevelopmentâ€�.

Although the state government in 1985 directed conservation of the biodiversity of this tract, for the past few years, the sanctuary has come under the onslaught of imprudent picnickers, boisterous eatery owners, clamorous devotees and politicians.

Nature group Pugmarks founder Anirudh Chaoji said that despite strong opposition from environmentalist and wildlife organisations, a local politician has recently authorised fresh constructions near the temple area at Bhimashankar.

â€œConsequently, today there is a well-developed tar road passing through the forest area. Likewise, the temple area is dotted with vendors, eateries and fast-food joints,â€� rued Chaoji, adding that three years ago a proposal was mooted restricting vehicles to a parking lot 10 km away from the sanctuary, but in vain. â€œToday, there is a huge parking lot in the heart of the sanctuary,â€� Chaoji said.

The eateries and roadside dhabas generate mounds of litter all around everyday. Also, smoke from the fastfood kitchens forces the shekru to leave its habitat in search of denser regions. Assistant conservator of forest (Bhimashankar wildlife sanctuary) V.T. Abhang told TNN that everyday, 25 field officers guard and patrol the entire sanctuary.

It is very difficult to get an accurate count of the squirrel population as they are extremely agile and keep moving across high branches. However, there are 700 giant squirrels in the sanctuary today,â€� Abhang said.

The giant squirrels generally dwell in evergreen, semi-green and deciduous forests. They are usually three feet in length and about six inches in height. The three sub species found in western ghats are Ratufa indica indica, Ratufa indica elphinstoni and Ratufa dealbata.

â€œThey are arboreal and rarely come to the ground. They have a brownish dorsal coat colour and leap from one tree to another, across gaps upto 20-foot-wide,â€� said Abhang. The giant squirrels in Maharashtra are reddish brown in colour, while the ones found in Madhya Pradesh and Kerala are brick-red and black, respectively.

Abhang said squirrels get disturbed during the annual fanfares at the temple. Nearly three lakh devotees visit the Shiva temple during Shravan and Mahashivaratri every day. The department is celebrating Wildlife Week from October 1 to October 7.

4,Naidu govt delaying modernisation of police force,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu might have got an instant idea to stop spate of robberies in suburbs by asking officials to provide cell phones to beat constables. When constables will get cell phones is a matter of debate.

But, Naiduâ€™s government has held back Rs 150-crore budget to the police department meant for modernising the force for the last two years.

The money, if released, could have been used for purchasing new vehicles, further improving communication system and the police armoury.

According to sources in the police department, the Centre is releasing about Rs 75 crore every year towards modernising the police force in the state. The state government has to allocate an equal amount as a matching grant.

The sources said the central funds have been put to use by the department and even utilisation certificates have also been issued for the purpose.

The central funds, which stood at about Rs 150 crore, were used mostly to purchase vehicles, improve the communication network for the city police.

However, with the state government not releasing the matching grant, several proposals from the district police, including Rangareddy which is witnessing a spate of robberies, murders and other offences, have been reportedly put in cold storage.

Police sources pointed out that the state government had even made budgetary provisions for the matching grant, but for inexplicable reasons, the finance department withheld the sanction.

â€œThe Union home ministry, which released the grants for modernisation scheme, is after us to show the stateâ€™s share and insisting on releasing the next quota only after submitting the utilisation certificates from the APâ€™s quota,â€� a senior police official told The Times of India.

5,Centre’s action averted communal riots in Gujarat: Minister,"KISHANGANJ: Union civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain asserted here on Thursday that it was the statesman-like conduct of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who cut short his Mauritius visit, and prompt action by the Central government which saved the country from a possible communal holocaust and bloodbath after the attack on Akshardham temple in Gujarat.

Hussain, talking to newsmen here, said that Pakistan-sponsored terrorist attack on the temple was a gameplan to ignite communal tension and Pakistan had sinister designs up its sleeve. However, the prompt and timely NSG action did not only unmask them but also nipped the trouble in the bud. â€œIt was a handsome tribute to the Indian people that the entire country had seen through the diabolical gameplan of a hostile neighbour and the people rallied around in crisis,â€� the minister remark.

Hussain skirted the question regarding the disinvestment of Air-India and Indian Airlines, which, for all practical purposes, appears to have been put on the backburner. He, however, said he would discuss the matter with disinvestment minister Arun Shourie.

As regards the rumblings within the NDA constituents over the disinvestment policy as well as the loud protests by the RSS, the minister played safe by putting the ball in the PMâ€™s court and said the misunderstanding and misconceptions would soon be cleared.

Hussain claimed that the NDA government was firmly in the saddle, notwithstanding the pinpricks and tantrums of some disgruntled elements. Even if some disgruntled elements deserted the BJP-led NDA coalition the government would easily sail through, he asserted adding â€œthere was absolutely no threat to the governmentâ€�. Hussain announced that Bagdogra airport, some 90 km from here, will become international in the last week of October with direct flight from Bagdogra to Kathmandu. The Bagdogra airport has recently been revamped and renovated.

Policeman suspended: A policeman, on duty at the SPâ€™s office, was put under suspension early last week allegedly on the charge of trying to outrage the modesty of a 20-year-old tribal girl at the bus terminal here.

Information about the suspension was broken by the Kishanganj SP, S K Singhal, on Wednesday. While talking to newsmen, Singhal said he has asked the DSP, headquarters, to probe the charge. He has also informed the DIG, Purnia range, over phone.

However, till Wednesday â€” a week after the incident â€” no FIR has been lodged with the Kishanganj police station.

The officer-in-charge, Md Sanaullah, when asked, confirmed that no case has been lodged against the errant policeman, Raghav Jha.

6,Tension in Gopalganj jail after inmates clash,"GOPALGANJ: Two days after the clash between two rival groups of undertrials in the Gopalanj jail, injuring about half a dozen undertrials, tension continues to prevail on the jail premises.

According to informed sources, clash occurred when two undertrials, Umesh Gupta and Jay Prakash Bharati, sat on a hunger strike in a bid to exert pressure on the jail administration for their transfer to the Debari jail. â€œWhen two other undertrials, Chandra Yadav and Shambhoo, tried to persuade Gupta and Bharati to end their hunger strike, they lost their temper and a clash ensued,â€� said a jail security guard on the condition of anonymity.

If the jailâ€™s insiders are to be believed, a fierce clash continued for hours. It came to an end only after the senior district officials pacified the warring groups. An FIR has been lodged by the jail superintendent Shivendra Priyadarshi with the Town police station and Sambhu Rai, Raja Dubey, Rajesh Sah, Sunil Singh, Chandrasen Singh and others have been named.

Though the district magistrate, H R Srinivas, could not be contacted, a senior district official, preferring anonymity, informed that deployment of police force was made to avert any retaliatory clash in jail in the wake of the recent conflict.

Besides, sources informed that hellish condition prevails in the overcrowded jail but the jail officials remain apathetic. â€œThere is no sanitation worth name and the undertrials are forced to attend the natureâ€™s calls in open field,â€� alleged Mahesh Prasad, relative of an undertrial lodged in the Gopalganj jail. a guardian of a UT.

Sometime back, a bloody clash between two groups of undertrials had taken place in the Gopalganj jail in which a dozen prisoners were injured. The clash had occurred on the issue of sleeping space.

7,Laloo rules out sabotage in Rajdhani mishap,"RANCHI: RJD leader Laloo Prasad Yadav on Thursday rejected outright the conclusion by railway authorities that sabotage caused the derailment of the Rajdhani train in Bihar last month and charged that â€œnegligenceâ€� by railways was responsible for the tragedy.

â€œWe outrightly reject this report. We still stand by our statement that negligence was responsible,â€� said Yadav while reacting to railwaysâ€™ safety commissionerâ€™s conclusion. Authorities in RJD- ruled Bihar and railways were locked in a blame game since the accident on its cause with the state government maintaining that poor maintenance of bridges and tracks and negligence could have caused the accident.

Yadav told â€œAaj Takâ€� that the report given by the commissioner was on the lines of the statement of the railway minister Nitish Kumar immediately after the mishap when he pointed towards sabotage. â€œRailway safety commissioner is hand in glove with the ministry,â€� he alleged.

â€œWe have been rejecting the statements of railway minister, minister of state for railways and railway board chairman who had said that the cause of the accident was sabotage, without carrying out any inquiry,â€� he said.

Yadav also said that in his memorandum to the Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani it was pointed out that if railway authorities covered up the negligence more accidents will occur. He said the Bihar police was continuing its probe and sought Centreâ€™s help in despatching technical experts.

Earlier, on Wednesday night the RJD chief criticised the apathetic attitude of the Vajpayee government in not heeding intelligence reports on possible terrorist attacks on religious places.

he said that the RJD too had several times asked the Centre for additional security at religious places apprehending terrorist attacks. But the Centre had turned a deaf ear to all warnings.

In fact, Laloo pointed out the Vajpayee government was not capable enough to protect the country against terrorist attacks.

While advocating the policy of uprooting terrorism from its very roots., Laloo however, did not appear to be in favour of a war since according to him this would not be a permanent solution to the problem.

Coming back to Jharkhand Laloo said that just as the Vajpayee government was a failure at the Centre, so was the Marandi government in Jharkhand which had only succeeded in creating a divide in society through its domicile and reservation policies. The RJD chief said he would not allow this divide to take place and personally lead a statewide campaign after the Durga puja.

8,Outsourcing policy must be fair: Judge,"MUMBAI: The government should adopt a pragmatic and balanced approach when framing its policy on industrial outsourcing, Justice J.S. Vazifdar of the Bombay high court said at a seminar recently.

Justice Vazifdar said that the government must define the extent to which it would regulate outsourcing in the industry so as to ensure fairness for both labour and management.

â€œIt should not be that the industry survives at the expense of the labour or that the labour is exploited at the hands of the industry,â€™â€™ he said. He was speaking at a day-long seminar on outsourcing organised by the Twin City Industrial Employersâ€™Association.

The seminar was attended by prominent members from the industry, law and the state government. Justice Jayant Chitre, who presided over the second session, said that in view of the new industrial revolution, it was all the more necessary for the unions and the management to sit together and sort their disputes out.

â€œThe employers want complete freedom to conduct their business while the workers want security of employment. A balance is a must,â€™â€™ he said. The seminar was a forum for diverse views,with advocate Gobindram Talreja insisting on a free hand for employers to retrench employees and labour leader Dada Samant opposing this outright.

Mr Talreja said that employers should be given freedom to take decisions which they feel can generate more economic growth. But Mr Samant countered: â€œRetrenchment is not your only way of cutting costs. You can reduce costs by cutting expenses in production processes and marketing products, also.â€™â€™

Joint director of Industrial Health and Safety in Maharashtra V.G. Bukkawar said that India, like China, should decide on its policy regarding industrial productivity and pricing pattern so that its goods could compete globally.

â€œThe labour and the management should sit together and decide what is best for the industry,â€™â€™ he said.

9,Organisers seek SC okay to dance after 10 pm,"MUMBAI: Backstage bickering is once again threatening to get louder than the clickety-clack of dandiyas this Navratri.

A number of Navratri organisers have joined hands to approach the Supreme Court (SC) to challenge the 10 p.m. deadline for using loudspeakers. Adding to the organisers'' worries is the fact that this year the festivities have not been exempted from entertainment tax.

With the garba raas scheduled to sway into action from October 7, the festival organisers plan to move the apex court on Friday challenging the â€œblanket ban'''' on the use of loudspeakers beyond 10 p.m. â€œWhy can''t there be designated sound zones, which are located away from residential areas?'''' asked Devendra Joshi, president of Sankalp, one of the biggest festival organisers in the city.

â€œThe Sankalp Navratri festival, for instance, is being held at Goregaon Sport''s Club this year. There are no residential buildings in a 2-km radius around this ground. So, where is the question of disturbing anybody even if we continue our celebrations after 10 p.m., argued Mr Joshi, who is spearheading the movement.

Having learnt a bitter lesson last year when the SC-ordained 10 p.m. deadline was thrust upon garba raas festivities by the police with almost-military precision despite angry protests, the organisers seem to have done their home work well.

Their barbs are aimed at the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000, which state, â€œA loudspeaker or a public address system shall not be used at night (between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.), except in closed premises, for communication within, example auditoria, conference room, community halls and banquet halls''''.

The organisers'' lobby claims that it is absurd that the law permits discos and beer bars to function till 1 p.m. but expects a cultural festival to wrap up by 10 p.m. â€œAlso it is impossible to fit in 50,000 to 60,000 dandiya revellers in a closed auditorium in order to buy time,'''' an organiser, not willing to be identified, said.

The anti-noise pollution brigade, however, is confident that the SC will not lend a sympathetic ear to the organisers'' plea. Anti-Noise Pollution committee secretary Dr. Y.T. Oke said, â€œThe SC issued it''s order last year after much deliberation. Also, in the light of the recent suo motu notice issued to companies by the SC for defacing rocks in Himachal Pradesh we feel the apex court is taking a stringent stand on issues concerning the environmental degradation.''''

The other dampener for organisers is a notice issued by the collectors office on Thursday stating that they will have to cough up entertainment tax to the tune of 50 per cent of the revenue from sale of tickets. The state government had last year exempted Navratri mandals from paying entertainment tax.

However, according to government officials, the tax exemption was not passed on to the public in the form of cheaper tickets. Navratri mandals at Ghatkopar, Mulund, Vile Parle, Sion, Matunga and Juhu, some of which are frequented by the the filmi glitterati, continued to charge over Rs 1,000 for the tickets.

Additional collector (suburbs) P.S. Pandey said, the recent amendment to the Entertainment Duty Act, permits the collector to levy an entertainment tax for the festivities.

10,"IPA, MNCs clash over data sharing","NEW DELHI: Multinational and domestic pharma firms are locking horns over protection of R&D data in India. While MNCs are pushing for a longer period of data exclusivity, domestic firms â€” under the platform of IPA are lobbying for a shorter period of protection.

According to industry sources, IPA (a body of leading domestic pharma firms) is preparing a position paper, to be submitted to PMO and chemical and fertiliser ministry, on how a longer period of data protection will adversely affect the generic exports from India. The paper is expected to be submitted within second week of this month.

â€˜Data exclusivityâ€™ protects research data on toxicology, pharmacology, safety, efficacy, dosage and trials. In the US, it is provided for 5 years. (from the day of marketing approval of the drug). Sources said MNCs wanted India to provide data exclusivity under TRIPS obligation for at least 5 years.

IPA argued that although TRIPS agreement calls for a protection of data against â€˜unfair commercial useâ€™, it does not say anything on the kind and period of protection, leaving it to the respective country. And, countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand do not specify period of exclusivity, it added.

A senior Ranbaxy official said, a longer period of data exclusivity will hit the countryâ€™s generic exports. This will delay the launch of generic drug in the foreign market after patent expiry and also doing away with any opportunity of obtaining exclusive marketing rights of six months after the patent is over with a para IV filing (for a new usage/treatment). Both cases will lead to a major loss in revenues, he added.

It will lead to a higher cost of R&D, putting medium rung of firms in trouble. US is pushing for a 10-year of data exclusivity to dampen generic exports.

However, Rajiv Gulati, CMD, Eli Lilly, does not buy this view. At present, India does not provide any data exclusivity which is not moral and ethical. â€œHow can you allow Indian firms to use multinationalsâ€™ data for drug development,â€� he said.

Also, in the long run, data protection wonâ€™t affect generics exports per se as patent period is longer, allowing Indian companies time to be ready with the generic version. â€œThere should be a five-year data protection as practised in the US,â€� he added.

According to sources, IPAâ€™s position paper is reaching a stand that the country could continue with a three-year data exclusivity system which at present is provided under Schedule Y of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

11,Quota policy in IGIMS ignored,"PATNA: The state government is all set to lodge an FIR against the director and the administrator of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences for flouting reservation policy while making appointments to various posts of the institute.

The revelations made by special officer (enforcement), who inquired into the â€œappointment muddleâ€� and reported to the personnel and administrative reforms department, are startling. Several senior doctors and employees, belonging to the sections of the society not entitled to reservation, were appointed on â€œreserved postsâ€�, he added. Such doctors and employees may also lose their jobs.

Many of the past directors of the institute had also allegedly violated the reservation policy. Such directors may also face the music, sources indicated.

Additional secretary of the personnel department Niten Chandra has asked IGIMS director Dr A K Lal to furnish pointwise replies to the queries of inquiry officer within a week. Otherwise, the department would act as per the recommendations of the special officer (enforcement).

Apart from the director, the inquiry officer has also recommended filing of a criminal case against the instituteâ€™s administrator, Beni Madhav, and office superintendent K N P Chaurasia for their alleged involvement in making illegal appointments.

Sources said that following several complaints, the personnel department had asked the special officer (enforcement) to conduct an inquiry into the irregularities in appointment of associate professors, assistant professors and junior personnel. Without getting prior permission of the CM, who is the sole authority to allow conversion of reserved posts into unreserved, senior doctors and assistants were appointed, the inquiry report says.

Special officer (enforcement) has pointed out that associate professor of radiology Dr Himanshu Sekhar and of GI surgery Dr Sunil Sood were appointed on reserved posts meant for scheduled castes. Likewise, several assistant professors â€” Dr Mahendra Singh (urology), Dr Birendra Singh (gastro), Dr Sanjiv Kumar Srivastava (GI surgery), senior resident Dr Prem Kumar (radiology), Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad (oncology medicine) and Dr Harendra Prasad Sharma (pathology) â€” and many assistants, typists and stenographers were also appointed against reserved posts.

The inquiry officer has suggested that all illegal appointments be quashed immediately and eligible persons be appointed after â€œissuing special advertisementâ€�. He stated in his report that the director of IGIMS was also responsible for deliberately concealing the list of daily wagers, ad hoc appointees and employees from him.

12,Citizens flay flawed policies for skyscraper rash,"Mumbai: The erstwhile Shiv Sena-BJP allianceâ€™s controversial policies for redeveloping slums and dilapidated buildings are mainly responsible for the skyscrapers sprouting up in congested areas of the island city.

The Congress-led Democratic Front government has perpetuated these policies instead of review them, despite the strain these buildings are likely to cause on the fragile civic infrastructure, sources said.

â€œThese mammoth constructions symbolise a directionless city, which does not know where itâ€™s going in terms of its form and aesthetics. It is a signal that as a society, we are completely clueless,â€™â€™ said urban designer Rahul Mehrotra.

There is total lack of transparency on these projects, he said. â€œThe stakes are naturally high. Citizens are fighting a losing battle because they react too late,â€™â€™ he added.

Puran Doshi, the Congress corporator from Colaba, said he had written to chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, asking him to stay permissions for all new developments until the infrastructure is strengthened.

â€œThe BMC has given permission for major development of high-rise buildings and hotels on Nathalal Parekh Marg in Cuffe Parade. This will mean more people coming into the area and lead to extra consumption of water, more utilisation of road space and burden on the sewage lines,â€™â€™ he said. Already, Mr Doshi said, current residents were not getting enough water.

However, Cessed Properties Developers Association of Mumbai president Kishore Aversekar said that from October 1, developers would include water harvesting and recycling plants for sewage water as part of the redevelopment plan.

â€œThere are many more steps, under various stages of implementation, which will ensure that the vertical growth of the island city meets all requirements of the old and new residents,â€™â€™ he said.

Meanwhile, residents of Tardeo, Carmichael Road and Altamount Road, who are planning to join hands to protest against the 60-storey Tardeo twin towers, have now also received support from the Pedder Road Residentsâ€™ Association (PRRA).

The PRRA has been in the forefront in opposing the proposed viaduct passing through their area. â€œThese new residential towers are a total mockery of all developmental norms. Pedder Road residents are also part of the Cumballa Hill and we are totally opposed to any addition to the traffic congestion in this area.The PRRA has extended full support to residents of Carmichael Road, who are opposing this project,â€™â€™ said PRRA member Veena Singhal.

Former municipal commissioner D.M. Sukthankar had recommended a phenomenally high floor-space index (FSI) of 4, which a private developer could utilise for redeveloping and rehousing people living in about 19,000 old and dilapidated buildings in the island city.

FSI is the ratio of plot size to permissible built-up area. The Sena-BJP government of the time, which had appointed Mr Sukthankar to suggest ways to speedily repair such buildings, did one betterâ€”it simply brushed away his suggestion of capping the FSI at 4 for rehabilitation purposes. Instead, it allowed builders virtually unlimited FSI, giving them a free hand to construct residential towers with mind-boggling heights in crowded areas.

The 45-floor Shreepati Arcade in congested Nana Chowk was one of the first towers to be constructed under the policy for redeveloping old properties. The two 60-storey high-rises coming up in Tardeoâ€™s MP Mill compound are part of the slum redevelopment scheme, in which the existing slum dwellers have been rehoused free of cost in new buildings by the developers.

The sale of flats in these two towers will help the developers recover the cost for rehousing these slum families. But, it is only now that the residents in the neighbourhood are waking up to the problems the plethora of new towers will bring to their localities. As one resident puts it, â€œIt will be the kiss of death.â€™â€™

14,DSP among 18 killed in J&K violence,"JAMMU: Two of the three terrorists involved in the Hiranagar carnage of last Tuesday were killed by the security forces after an 11-hour overnight encounter ending at 10 am on Thursday.

DSP Gulzar Singh and a constable were also killed, while two constables were injured. In other incidents, 14 infiltrators were killed by the security forces in J&K since Wednesday and five CRPF personnel were injured in an attack by terrorists.

The security forces had been in pursuit of the three terrorists, who had, on October 1, minutes before the polling started, killed 11 passengers of a Delhi-Jammu bus on the highway at Hiranagar Morh and one passenger of a matador they had earlier hijacked from a border village.

Seventeen persons were also injured as the terrorists lobbed grenades into the bus and fired all around indiscriminately.

While the security forces were looking for the terrorists around the villages close to the border, two of them were spotted on Wednesday night.

Meanwhile, the security forces killed eight infiltrators in the Mundhar sector of Poonch district in an encounter starting on Wednesday and ending Thursday.

15,"Development of N-E a priority, says Shourie","NEW DELHI: The North-East region could soon become the hub of international investment from being a hotbed of insurgency. The deployment of four 50-seater aircraft to start feeder services, augmentation of the 12 existing airports to improve connectivity, coupled with a major development thrust and the introduction of e-governance may soon transform the N-E region.

Launching a website designed especially to attract investors and for transparency and better monitoring of various development projects, disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, who is also in charge of the department of N-E region, said here on Wednesday: â€˜â€˜All these initiatives have been taken by the Centre for coordinating major developmental projects and funding them through the non-lapsable Central pool or through the North-East Council (NEC).''''

16,HP govt acts to save fragile rocks in Manali highway,"SHIMLA: The Himachal Pradesh government has learnt environment conservation lessons the hard way. After the Supreme Court imposed a Rs 1 crore fine on it last week for allowing private companies to deface fragile rocks on the Kullu-Manali highway, the state government has finally issued guidelines for display of advertisements and hoardings on roadsides.

A government spokesman on Wednesday said the issue of putting up hoardings and signboards on roadsides was reexamined and it was felt that they were eyesores, leading to â€˜â€˜aesthetic pollution'''' as they did not blend with the local environment.

The spokesman said the government agreed with the SC on the issue.

He said advertisements would not be allowed on roadside structures, including retaining walls, parapets, culverts, railings, trees or other plantations, milestones, rocks and boulders. All existing hoardings and boards would be removed and and their inventory be made, detailing the location and the name of either the company, the firm or the individual, he said.

17,PM got us arrested before meeting: Jogi,"NEW DELHI: Chattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, along with his Cabinet colleagues and party leaders, were on Friday taken into police custody for violation of prohibitory orders.

Jogi alleged that the arrest was deliberate to prevent a meeting with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the issue of paddy procurement.

""He (Vajpayee) got us arrested before the meeting. That means he does not want to meet us,"" Jogi told reporters at the Tughlaq Road Police Station after he was arrested when he began leading a march towards the PM''s residence.

Jogi also refused an invitation to take an eleven-member delegation for his scheduled meeting at 1230 hrs with Vajpayee saying ""either all of us will go or none.""

After meeting Congress Chief Sonia Gandhi, Jogi had started his march from the Chattisgarh Bhawan at Sardar Patel Road, nearly three kms away from PM''s residence, to press for procurement of paddy from the drought-affected state or alternatively financial assistance as compensation.

The Chief Minister, along with his two dozen cabinet colleagues, besides party MPs and MLAs, were taken into police custody.

Jogi is the second Congress Chief Minister after his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh to take to agitation on the issue of procurement of paddy.

""We want the paddy procurement prices to be increased. But even at the existing procurement price (Rs 550 a tonne), we want the centre to procure entire produce from the state,"" Jogi said. The state had suffered a loss of about Rs 423 crore on the issue last year and it could ill-afford any further burden on this count, Jogi said.

A state government spokesman said that paddy production during the current year was expected at around 10 lakh tonnes against 18 lakh tonnes.

He said the Chief Minister was to meet Vajpayee on the issue of delay in drought relief, also in view of the demand of Rs 2300 crore made by the state.

19,Jogi meets PM after arrest drama,"NEW DELHI: After an arrest and release drama, Chattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi met the Prime Minister on Friday over the issue of Central procurement of paddy in his state. He reportedly expressed ''dissatisfaction'' over the meeting.

""The problem still persists. Though the Prime Minister and the food minister have assured us that they will examine the issue, they have not been able to give us any satisfactory answer to us,"" said Jogi, who met Vajpayee after a high-voltage drama when he, along with his entire Cabinet, was arrested for violation of prohibitory orders by the Delhi Police hours before a scheduled appointment at 1230 hours.

Stressing that his government will continue raising the demand, Jogi said: ""It is the responsiblity of the Centre to procure the paddy from the state if the market price is less.""

Maintaing that the Prime Minister had not given a ''final answer'' in the meeting, Jogi said the state was also ready to work as an ''agent'' and procure the paddy but for that it needs financial assistance.

Earlier, Jogi, along with his Cabinet colleagues and party leaders, were taken into police custody for violation of prohibitory orders, but the Chief Minister alleged that the arrest was deliberate to prevent a meeting with Vajpayee.

""I am sad as well as surprised over the whole drama. The way they (Centre) got us arrested and then released,"" Jogi said.

20,CM rules out Cauvery water release to TN,"BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: Hours after the Supreme court directive to Karnataka on Friday to abide by the Cauvery River Authority (CRA) decision regarding water release to Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister S M Krishna virtually ruled out releasing water from any of the state''s reservoirs. He has convened the cabinet and an all-party meeting here on Saturday to elicit opinion. Immediately after the order was passed, Krishna was closetted with his cabinet colleagues H K Patil and D B Chandre Gowda and legal experts to discuss the outcome of the order. ``The question of any release from Karnataka reservoirs may not arise for consideration as disclosed in the affidavit filed before the apex court on October 3. We hope rains in the intermediate catchment and lower catchment would improve and 9,000 cusecs as directed by the court and CRA will be available in Mettur reservoir,'''' Krishna said in a statement released here. Krishna said that the Central Water Commission (CWC) gauging station at Biligundlu has been reporting an inflow of 5,000 cusecs of water per day. Between Biligundlu and Mettur reservoir, the lower catchment area of 5,535 sq km should yield 1,825 cusecs per day. ``Thus the water, which should be reaching Mettur reservoir, at present, is about 6,25 cusecs,'''' he added. The history of flows into Mettur in the last 11 years shows that the intermediate and lower catchment together have generated a minimum of 32.4 tmcft of water ie, 11,880 cusecs per day in the month of October. Earlier, speaking to reporters in Delhi, Krishna said he will request Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee to convene an emergency meeting of the CRA in the wake of the apex court order. Meanwhile, Home Minister Mallikarjun M. Kharge said it is ``difficult for the state to obey'''' the CRA directive. ``Our intention is not to disobey the apex court, Prime Minister or anyone. We have the highest regard for both. It is just that we do not have water,'''' he added. Asked if it was not a rigid stand, Kharge said the state government had expressed its inability to release water in view of the drought situation. ``We do not have the strength to obey the order. Only God can give us the strength. Nature has failed us,'''' he added.
