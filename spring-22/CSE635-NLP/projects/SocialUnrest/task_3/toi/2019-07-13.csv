1,"Katiyar, Singh: Musketeers of UP politics","LUCKNOW: The era of angry young men may be over in Bollywood but it is very much alive in UPâ€™s political scenario. Dramatic changes over the past fortnight which heralded the entry of sabre-rattling duo Vinay Katiyar and Arun Kumar Singh Munna as party presidents of the BJP and the Congress, respectively, make one thing amply clear â€” musclemen are in and moderates are out.

Both the newly-appointed party chiefs have much in common. Katiyar, one of the founding presidents of the Bajrang Dal, has always been known for a quick temper and a tongue to match. The Faizabad MP wears his Hindu leanings one his sleeves and is generous with loaded one-liners and retorts whenever provoked, which is quit often. â€œIf Muslims can say Khuda Hafiz why canâ€™t I say Jai Shri Ram,â€� he bluntly told mediapersons trying to read between the slogans during his first visit to Faizabad after his nomination as state BJP chief. His constant refrain of mandir zaroor banega and the current nitpicking on chief minister Mayawati is already giving an anxious time to the BJP moderates.

However, his latest war cry to the CM to â€œbehave or the lotus will be withdrawn from the elephant trunkâ€� and the clarion call â€œBJP karyakarta ki izzat hi meri izzat haiâ€� may have given jitters to some of his colleagues, it has certainly enthralled the cadre. The style of functioning is in direct contrast to his predecessor, the comparatively meeker Kalraj Mishra who believed in the least confrontation.

Similar is the case with UPCC president Munna. The former president of Allahabad University and the state Youth Congress, Munna is liberal with phrases like lad liya jayega, nipat lenge. His first press conference came as a minor shock for mediapersons used to cautiously-worded approach of former president Shri Prakash Jaiswal.

And his revival mantra for the party is â€œconfront the administration, get under their skin, let there be lathi-chargeâ€� and sadak ki ladai. He declared at his maiden press conference how during his Youth Congress days he carried â€œstones in his kurta pockets to throw at a policeman at the opportune momentâ€�, as the seasoned CLP leader Pramod Tiwari looked distinctly uncomfortable.

2,MLAs protest against poor power supply,"PATNA: Cutting across party line, MLAS from Bhagalpur district staged a strong protest against the erratic power supply to their area.

They staged a noisy dharna infront of the Speakerâ€™s chamber and even managed to block the proceedings of the House for some time by displaying placards, shouting slogans and sitting in the well of the House. They were later persuaded by their party colleagues to resume their seats. The MLAs were demanding that the Speaker should exert pressure on the government to ensure power supply to Bhagalpur.

They demanded immediate steps to restore â€œuninterrupted power supplyâ€� in Bhagalpur for the Shravani festival. The Speaker assured the members, including BJPâ€™s Ashwini Chaubey and Sudha Srivastava of Samata, that he would look into the problem.

3,NHRC cautions state govts against communalism,"LUCKNOW: Going by the manner in which life in Gujarat has been thrown into turmoil after the Godhara incident, the National Human Rights Commission has cautioned the state governments not to let communal elements stoke passion any longer.

The warning given on June 10, 2002, by chairperson Justice K Ramaswami, Justice Sujata V Manohar and Virendra Dayal, reminded the government of two rulings of the Madras High Court in which, the bench observed that even in the Constitution of India, there was a prior guarantee of the freedom of religion and that all religions were to be treated equally, with the state maintaining neutrality. Even the Supreme Court concurred with this report, the NHRC said. It further added that there was an even greater need now, in the light of the Constitutional guarantees that exist, for the state and its agents to act in accordance with this very principle.

The commission also urged the concerned people to behave in such a manner that peace is not disturbed and innocent residents of the state are not exposed to violence.

The commission felt that gaurav yatras, can very well turn a sensitive situation volatile. Such yatras were also planned by a splinter unit of the Shiv Sena in Uttar Pradesh at the time of the purnaahuti yagna, but they were later differed. Altogether, 23 centres in the country were selected for the yatra at the time.

Meanwhile, the state unit of PUCL has drawn the attention of the government to the Nathua incident in which, innocent members of a minority community were attacked in Pipraich in Gorakhpur district. Similar attacks were also carried out on the minority community, at Pandehata in the same district, said the PUCL vice-president Chitranjan Singh. Singh has also written letters to the chairman of NHRC, to take up these issues, so that the situation does not take an ugly turn.

5,Unions rally behind Nitish over E Rly bifurcation,"DANAPUR: Members of both the recognised railway unions â€” Eastern Railway Menâ€™s Union (ERMU) and Eastern Railway Menâ€™s Congress (ERMC) â€” have expressed their solidarity with railway minister Nitish Kumar on the issue of bifurcation of the Eastern Railway.

According to secretary of the Patna branch ERMU Shashi Kant Pandey, his union fully supports the bifurcation to achieve an all-round development of railways in the state. He maintained that though the country had achieved freedom in 1947, railway employees of Danapur, Mughalsarai and Dhanbad divisions of the Eastern Railway will, however, achieve freedom on October 1, 2002 when the newly created East Central zone at Hajipur becomes functional comprising these three divisions of the Eastern Railway.

Pandey said that the ER headquarters at Kolkata always adopted a pick and choose policy towards the employees of the state. As a result, legitimate claims and dues of the employees are yet to be solved particularly in the case of promotion, filling up of vacancies and settlement of grievances, he said adding the East Central Railway (ECR) is likely to prove a boon for the majority of the harassed employees of the state.

A member of the ERMC of the Danapur branch admitted that the zonal office of the ER at Kolkata is not meting out a fair deal to the employees of the state for one reason or the other. Poor and harassed employees, thus, kept on shuttling between Danapur and Howrah even for a trifling matter, he said and added that the work culture of the zonal office in Kolkata is completely different and not conducive especially for the poor employees.

Daily Passengersâ€™ Welfare Association general secretary S N Sharma appealed to the railway minister to stick to his decision to bifurcate the ER failing which the association will launch a phase-wise agitation.

6,Four youths arrested for dacoity,"KOLKATA: With the arrest of four youths, all in their early 20s, on Lenin Sarani in Kolkata on Thursday, the police claim to have thwarted the attempt by individual goons, from various parts of the city, to form a gang of their own.

The four were planning to commit a dacoity in a commercial centre at 77, Lenin Sarani when they were apprehended. However, a fifth member of the gang, a notorious criminal from Kidderpore, managed to escape.

The police had received tip-offs about some youths moving around the area suspiciously on motorcycles, since the last few days. On Thursday night at around 10 pm, a police team from Taltala waited near Commercial Point at 77, Lenin Sarani. Soon, a motorcycle carrying three people arrived at the spot followed by another.

The second bike was carrying two people. As the pillion rider of the second motorcycle dismounted, the police team surrounded the first bike. The rider of the second bike managed to make a getaway leaving his associates behind.

The four who were apprehended were identified as Sarfaraz from Ripon Street, Shahnawaz alias Tinku from Karaya, Tariq Alam alias Pinky from Bedford Lane and Sarfaraz Nawaz from Narkeldanga Main Road.

7,CID arrests 8 people involved in stamp racket,"KOLKATA: Eight persons involved in a fake judicial stamp racket have been arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department of the state police.

Three of them, Sayeed and Ashish Chakra-borty from Kolkata and Ramratan Soni from Maharashtra, are now in the custody of the Bangalore police. They are supposed to be the masterminds behind the racket. Chakraborty is a dismissed employee of the Central Industrial Security Force.

According to S.I.S. Ahmed, additional director-general, CID, â€œThe gang has inter-state ramifications. We are probing into the racket with cooperation from Bangalore police. A separate wing to probe economic offences has been set up recently in the CID. They are investigating the case.â€� A team of sleuths from the CID is likely to leave for Karnataka shortly.

The racketeers have also spread their tentacles in Pune, Hyderabad and Delhi. Fake revenue stamps are prepared by a method called gum washing. A one rupee stamp is washed out and a higher denomination is marked on it by offset printing.

The stamp racket came to light one year ago when one person involved in the stamp racket was arrested and a Bangalore police team came over to Kolkata for investigation. The criminals were selling the fake stamps to real estate agents. But no headway could be made then. A few months ago, a man appeared at Ashoknagar, in North 24 Parganas, and handed over a fake Rs 500 note to a trader.

The trader immediately raised an alarm saying he had received a similar currency note earlier. Members of a local club handed over the miscreant to the police. Soon after, the owner of a jewellery shop complained that this same man had lured him into circulating Rs 500 notes in the market. He was offered an incentive of Rs 5,000 for circulating fake notes worth Rs 20,000. This led the police to arrest the racketeer.

Currency notes and fake stamps worth about Rs 50 lakh was recovered from him. Tests conducted at the CFSL confirmed that the stamps were fake, said SDPO Barasat. This led the police to believe that the racket had links with gangs in other states.

10,PJR flays govt over Krishna waters issue,"HYDERABAD: Alleging that the state government was lacking the commitment to bring Krishna waters to the city, former minister and senior Congress leader P Janardhan Reddy has criticised the government for not spending any amount on the Krishna water diversion project which was conceived by former chief minister late N T Rama Rao.

â€œSeven years passed after N T Rama Rao laid the foundation stone for the project and no work has been taken up as yet including the finalisation of tenders,â€� Reddy said.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Reddy alleged that the ruling party was only raking up the issue of Krishna water diversion whenever there were elections to either Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad or the surrounding municipalities. To illustrate his claim, he said that tenders were invited for project implementation which has been divided into four packages in May, and as many as 52 firms, including Larsen and Toubro, expressed their interest to take up the works. However, the tenders are yet to be finalised, reflecting the governmentâ€™s commitment to implement the project.

In addition, Reddy said the government has not allocated sufficient amounts for the project, estimated to cost about Rs 875 crore, despite assurances that Rs 350 crore would be mobilised immediately.

Reddy said that the Congress, which had organised empty pot demonstration and dharnas recently, would continue its struggle till the project is materialised and the people of the twin cities are relieved from the water crisis they had been facing.

""We have no problem if the election is held under the governor''s rule. We are not scared of that...,"" he said at the Mazar-e-Shohda'' (martyrs graveyard) here.

""We are also ready to contest polls under the governor''s rule as we believe that we have a mass support base, but there should be an amendment to the constitution to this effect accordingly,"" he added.

14,Stability of DF govt is not our concern: PWP,"PUNE: Stating that stability of Democratic Front (DF) government in Maharashtra was not its concern, senior Pheasants Workers Party (PWP) leader Prof N D Patil on Saturday said ""instead of expecting us to join them, DF would do well to clean up its houses"".

Talking to reporters here before the beginning of PWP''s central committee meeting, Patil charged Congress with sharing power with communal forces in several zilla parishads.

He said PWP was totally disenchanted with the DF government which had always sidelined his party in the decision making process and yet expected its support.

Disclosing that PWP was not in favour of extending support to the DF from the very beginning, he said political compulsion of keeping the saffron combine at bay prompted them to support the DF.

""We aggreed to support them after chalking out common minimum programme with the Congress-NCP combine. However, we found that we were never consulted before taking decision on any important issues and would come to know about it through newspapers,"" he added.

The events that happened last month rocking the DF government was the cumulative effect of sidelining PWP prompting the party to take a drastic step with a view to teach them a lesson, he added.

PWP leaders including Jayant Patil, former minister Ganpatrao Deshmukh, legislator Jayant Patil and others attended the central committee meeting.

Earlier, preceding the central committee meeting, an executive meeting of PWP was held at the inspection bungalow here.

Lamenting the ""apathy"" of the DF government towards the woes of the people, Patil alleged that issues concerning water problem, growing unemployment among the educated youth, power crisis in the state etc were not given much importance.

Reiterating that the PWP would not join the DF government at any cost, Patil said they would chalk out the strategy to force the government to be more sincere in addressing the problems of the people.

Replying to a question on Enron, he said, ""both the state and the Central government went overboard in welcoming Enron thinking that it was the only panacea for the power problems of the state and as a result the whole state had to suffer"".

Now the best course is to set up an effective alternative to Enron, he added.

16,Sonia asks PM to review riot victims' rehab,"AHMEDABAD: Leader of the Opposition in Parliament Sonia Gandhi has written to Prime Minister A B Vajpayee urging him to review the relief and rehabilitation of riot victims in Gujarat.

In a letter on Saturday she expressed her dissatisfaction with the work done so far and questioned the logic behind closing some of the relief camps. She has also called the compensation grossly inadequate.

""I am told that many camps have already been closed and there is pressure from the state government to wind up the remaining camps as well when the situation does not warrant their closure,"" Gandhi has said in the letter. ""I am receiving reports from a wide cross-section that the victims residing at the camps, most of whom are poor and still urgently in need of food rations, shelter during monsoons and fair compensation.""

According to her, the compensation paid so far is not only inadequate, but also gone only to a small percentage of the victims. ""You are aware that many of the affected people have lost their sources of livelihood as well their homes. Adequate compensation and loans for reconstruction are therefore an urgent necessity.""

Gandhi complains that even some of the obvious measures, like proper sanitation, safe drinking water, medicines and education of children, have not been taken by the state and Central governments.

19,Sharad Yadav rules out Dal merger,"BANGALORE: Plans of a merger between the two Janata Dal factions suffered a setback on Saturday with JD(U) national president Sharad Yadav categorically ruling it out on grounds that ``there was no such proposal'''' before him.

Speaking to reporters after a one-hour meeting with JD(U) leader Ramakrishna Hegde here, Yadav said: ``I have not received any proposal from anyone for the merger. Neither have any local leaders appealed for it. So, the question of merger does not arise at all.''''

Yadav described the JD(U) aligning with JD(S) during the Kanakapura by-election as ``only a working arrangement.''''

On state JD(U) president C. Byre Gowda''s remarks that an all-India JD party would soon be formed, Yadav shot back: ``We are already a national party with a glorious history.''''

Stating that the party''s executive committee will meet soon to elect office-bearers and state presidents, Yadav said his discussion with Hegde revolved around strengthening and expanding the party throughout the country, specially in view of Assembly elections in four states. ``The purpose of my visit is to inquire about Hegde''s health,'''' he added.

He spiked reports that Hegde was tipped for the post of Maharashtra Governor. ``It is a very small post for a man of his stature,'''' Yadav remarked.

Yadav condemned the arrest of MDMK leader Vaiko, who has been detained under POTA for his pro-LTTE statements.

BYRE DENIAL: Meanwhile, Byre Gowda denied that he had resigned as the party chief. However, it is learnt that Byre Gowda expressed anguish to Hegde over certain statements made by some party workers.

``If the party feels I have been ineffective as president, I am ready to quit,'''' sources quoting Gowda said.

However, some second-rung functionaries in the party met Yadav before he left for Delhi in the evening and submitted a memorandum. They wanted the central leadership to replace Byre Gowda as he has been in the post since three years. Besides, it would take at least an year to announce the calender of events to hold election to the post.
