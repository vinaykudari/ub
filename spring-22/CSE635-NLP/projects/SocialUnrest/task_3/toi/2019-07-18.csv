0,This officer puts him on the wrong side of the law,"MUMBAI: The next time chemical engineer S.A. Varma renews his passport, he will have to answer the question, â€˜Have you ever been arrested?â€™ in the affirmative. The man who frequently conducts workshops on textile chemistry abroad will then have to explain why.

The Kafkaesque story of how Mr Varma, father of two grown-up daughters, entered the police records began on June 28 when an 18-year-old boy fell off the terrace of his building and died.

Rajaram Reddy, the boy, had gone to the terrace of the five- storey building that afternoon to meet his uncle, Mohan Reddy, a small contractor.

Mohan Reddy was on the terrace of building E-5 in Jai Taramani cooperative housing society, Bangur Nagar, Goregaon (W), for a minor water-proofing job. No one saw Rajaram fall but itâ€™s presumed that he sat on the 3.5-feet boundary wall and lost his balance.

That is the statement his uncle made to the police. The statement also says the boy had come to meet him, having just arrived on a visit to the city. As Rajaram toppled backwards, he fell on a wooden ledge, which collapsed. The ledge was meant to block rain water from entering the staircase passage.

Sub-inspector Manohar Awhad of Goregaon police station, who investigated the case, contended that the boy wouldnâ€™t have died had the ledge been firm. â€œThis amounts to negligence of safety aspects by the housing society and attracts section 304(A) of the Indian Penal Code,â€™â€™ he told Mr Varma, chairperson of the housing society.

This correspondent inspected the terrace and found that the ledge was beyond the wall and anyone leaning on it would be risking a fall.

The entire managing committee of the housing society argued for two hours that the case against Mr Varma was unjustified, but sub-inspector Awhad was adamant.

When the residents asked for Ramesh Keny, the officer in charge of the police station, the sub-inspector said he was acting under Mr Kenyâ€™s instructions. The residents could not meet Mr Keny as he was on leave that day.

â€œSub-inspector Awhad was about to have me finger-printed as well but Inspector P.S. Gawande intervened and waived off the procedure,â€™â€™ said Mr Varma. He was allowed to go after depositing a security amount of Rs 900 at the police station, as is the rule with bailable offences.

Criminal lawyers say there is no case against Mr Varma. â€œThis is sheer abuse of power by the police, which revels in harassing the meek and ignorant,â€™â€™ said Shrikant Bhat. Former government pleader P. Vyas said this was a fit case for action against the police officer concerned. Ashok Dhamija, who quit the Indian Police Service to become a lawyer, said the police officer had simply not applied his mind to the case. â€œPolicemen sometimes are oblivious of the damage they cause to the social standing of a man by needlessly arresting him,â€™â€™ he said.

Sub-inspector Awhad repeated the negligence charge when this correspondent contacted him. But on being confronted with legal opinion, he said he was acting on Mr Kenyâ€™s instructions. Mr Keny could not contacted despite efforts over two days.

1,Six arrested in dacoity cases,"MUMBAI: Six people allegedly involved in 30 dacoities in the city and Navi Mumbai were arrested by the Byculla police recently.

Five stolen motorcycles, a 9 mm pistol, two countrymade revolvers and five choppers were recovered from them.

Additional commissioner R.T. Rathod said that the police were still to recover stolen cash and jewellery, estimated to be worth over Rs 10 lakhs.

A Santro car, which the accused had allegedly stolen from Worli seaface on June 2, is also still to be found. Incidentally, the car was stolen from near the home of police commissioner M.N. Singh.

The arrested men have been identified as Amjad Qureshi, the group leader, Mohammed Naeem Shaikh, Bharat Pratapsingh, Iqlaq Ansari, Umar Shaikh and Shakir Shaikh. They have been remanded to police custody.

Deputy commissioner R.D. Shinde said Qureshi was held at Zakaria Bunder Road in Sewri on June 29. Qureshi, who had come to the area with three of his aides, reportedly tried to escape when the police ordered him to surrender.

However, he was arrested after a bullet fired by assistant inspector Arun Chavan injured him on the thigh. But his associates managed to flee.

Qureshiâ€™s interrogation led the police to five others. They were arrested from different places in the city between June 30 and July 15. They have reportedly admitted to their involvement in offences in Byculla, Bhandup, Kalachowkie and Navi Mumbai. â€œWe are in the process of attaching a flat in Mumbra owned by Qureshi,â€™â€™ senior inspector S.K.

2,Keswani seeks Cong help in RS by-polls,"MUMBAI: Independent candidate Suresh Keswani left for Delhi on Wednesday to seek support from the Congress for his candidature in the by-election to the Rajya Sabha. The last date for withdrawal of candidature is Thursday.

He is contesting against a formidable candidate, former governor P.C. Alexander, who has secured support from the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance and the Sharad Pawarled Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

According to party sources, Mr Keswani called on senior Congress leaders to secure the partyâ€™s support. Meanwhile, MPCC president Govindrao Adik said, â€œThe party high command will take a final decision regarding the by-election.â€™â€™

He said the Congress had accepted the NCPâ€™s claim over the seat since the by-election was necessitated by the death of sitting NCP MP Mukesh Patel.

Mr Adik claimed that the NCP had not consulted the Congress before finalising an independent candidate who was supported by the SS-BJP alliance.

Mr Keswani had got elected as an independent candidate in the biennial elections held for the Rajya Sabha in 1996 under controversial circumstances.

3,...farmers feel the lagaan pinch,"LUCKNOW: Already facing the brunt of rain gods, farmers in Uttar Pradesh are on the verge of starvation as there is no let-up in state governmentâ€™s revenue realisation drive in draught-hit areas.

About 5000 farmers have so far been put behind bars for failing to pay up their dues and their is an exodus from the affected villages. Soon after taking over reins, Mayawati had cracked whip to step up revenue realisation in order to fill up stateâ€™s empty coffers.

Revenue officials went overboard using â€˜British methodsâ€™ to recover arrears for pleasing Maya Memsaâ€™ab. Once the orders reached the tehsil level, a massive crackdown was launched against the defaulters. Even small and marginal farmers were not spared during the drive and arrears of main and miscellaneous dues were recovered from them.

Out of two types of dues realised at the tehsil level, land, irrigation, raqabi and other agriculture-related dues come under main dues while miscellaneous dues comprise bank, consolidation, trade tax, power and stamp duty-related arrears and dues.

The drive for main dues is started from October 1 to September 30 while the same for miscellaneous from April 1 to March 31. Failure to pay revenue or clear arrears invites detention/jail term and attachment of property or both. But, Usually small and marginal farmers, possessing less than 3.125 acres of land, are exempted from such drives.

Reports coming from different tehsils suggest that many farmers had to sell or mortgage their lands and valuables to fill governmentâ€™s empty coffers. Many of them are on the run as â€˜ameensâ€™ are cracking British-style whip to follow Mayawatiâ€™s orders. â€œSuch is the situation that farmers flee their villages on hearing the sound of any approaching vehicle. Many villages now wear a deserted look. Those left, have nothing to clear their dues,â€� says a senior revenue official.

Thanks to the harsh measures, the revenue collection has substantially gone up this year. Figures available suggest that Rs 661.53 crore have been realised as miscellaneous dues while Rs 179.48 crore as main dues till June end. It was Rs 90 crore and Rs 10 crore more than the corresponding month figures of previous year.

The government is working on the relief front with revenue minister Ravi Gautam directing the principal secretary, revenue to inspect the relief works being carried out from the calamity relief fund.

The chief minister has constituted a three-member committee to review the situation. But, there has no directive so far been issued to suspend the revenue collection drive.

4,Crisil will grade govt hospitals in 3 states,"BANGALORE: The Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL), a premier credit rating agency, has been assigned to grade government-run hospitals in three states.

CRISIL Managing Director R. Ravi Mohan told The Times of India: ``We will sign an ongoing contract with these states soon. In turn, it will help to gauge how much aid each hospital deserves. Funds will be allocated accordingly.'''' He, however, did not disclose the names of the states.

Over the past one year, after assigning healthcare grades to two hospitals in New Delhi and one in Chennai recently, it has assigned `Grade A'' to the Mumbai-based Bombay Hospital and Medical Research Centre (BHMRC), managed by the Bombay Hospital Trust. CRISIL has classified BHMRC as a multi-speciality tertiary care hospital, and its grade indicates very good quality of patient care.

The 440-bed in-patient hospital has facilities, equipment, manpower and service quality levels that are consistent with the highest standards in the Indian healthcare industry. ``Our grading for institutions is an opinion on the relative quality of healthcare delivered by them. A hospital graded higher would have better facilities, superior quality levels and greater consistency in services delivery compared to lower graded ones,'''' he added.

The agency''s hospitals are categorised under nursing homes, general secondary care, speciality secondary care, multi-speciality tertiary care and single-speciality tertiary care.

CRISIL grades hospitals on a four-point scale, A to D, rated as very good quality, good quality, average and poor. Its grading process is a multi-layered decision-making process. A team of analysts is assigned to interact with institutions and discuss mission and policy, regulatory compliance, medical specialities, support services, management evaluation, patients'' rights, nursing care and financial performance.

It has developed healthcare grading methodology based on seven broad parameters, after an in-depth analysis of various grading criteria adopted by international agencies in USA, Australia and Canada and fine-tuned it to Indian standards.

6,Govt in a jam over reservation policy,"PATNA: The Rabri government was caught in an embarrassing situation in the state assembly on Wednesday, when leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi pointed out that the government was yet to implement the reservation policy it had approved last year.

Parliamentary affairs minister Ram Chandra Purbey said he would â€œfind outâ€� what had gone wrong with it. The new reservation policy passed by the cabinet on May 22, 2001 curtails the quota of scheduled tribes (STs) from 10 per cent to one per cent as after the stateâ€™s bifurcation the population of tribals in residual Bihar remained just 5.6 lakh.

The reservation for backward castes was hiked from 10 per cent to 13 per cent. Similarly, the reservation quota for scheduled caste (SCs) and extremely back ward castes was hiked from 14 per cent to 15 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively. The quota for other backward caste women was increased from two to three per cent.

However, the governmentâ€™s proposal faced rough weather at Raj Bhavan, as the governor sent it back to the state government asking it to seek a broad consensus on the issue and also instructed that it should bring a Bill instead of an ordinance. The new reservation policy also faced a stiff opposition from land revenue minister Ramai Ram, who stressed that the reservation for SCs should be more and should be based on the 2001 census report.

Modi, while raising the matter during the zero hour, insisted that backward caste students were suffering due to non-implementation of the new reservation policy. He said in the colleges, and even in the combined entrance test of engineering and medical colleges, the old reservation policy was being followed. â€œTribal students from Jharkhand and other states are taking advantage of the 10 per cent reservation quota in Bihar,â€� he stressed, demanding that the government should table a Bill on the new reservation policy in the current session. However, Purbey remained uncommitted and stressed that the government would look into the matter.

8,House showdown over transport minister,"KOLKATA: The state Assembly saw some drama on Wednesday when Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim expelled Trinamul Congress MLA Tapas Roy, who persisted in pressing a privilege motion against state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. The entire Trinamul Congress walked out in protest.

Roy had brought a privilege motion against Chakraborty, alleging that the minister had deliberately misled the House regarding the antecedents of Tapas Ghosh, an accused in the Salt Lake Stadium case. Despite being accused of harbouring criminals, Ghosh was recently inducted as a member in the state sports council, Roy said.

Chakraborty denied that there was any such a case against Ghosh, adding, that if this was true, Ghosh would be removed from the council. Roy immediately charged that two cases, involving criminal conspiracy, harbouring criminals and a case under the Arms Act were registered against Ghosh last year at the Dum Dum police station, in which chargesheets have also been filed.

Halim, though, refused to allow the motion. â€œI do not find any malicious intent in the ministerâ€™s remarks. He had said that if any case is found, the person concerned will be removed. Where is the breach of privilege?â€� he said. Roy, however, persisted in pressing his point. Halim repeatedly asked him to sit down. When Roy did not listen, Halim ordered the marshall to remove him. Other Trinamul members joined him in walking out.

Later, Halim defended his ruling. â€œThe minister gives his replies based upon information supplied by his department. He has a right to give a wrong answer. In this case, the minister might not have been aware of these cases. There is no malicious intent here,â€� he said.

9,HC quashes govt memo on cops in illegal detention case,"HYDERABAD: Justice E Dharma Rao, judge of Andhra Pradesh high court, in a recent order set-aside the memo issued by the principal secretary, home department, proposing to drop criminal prosecution against Ch Venkatadri, assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Visakhapatnam, V S Krishna Murthy, the then head constable, Allavaram police station and V Narsimha Rao, police constable, Kotaduru police station.

The judge observed that these officers were sought to be prosecuted for offence punishable under Sections 330 and 348 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The allegations against the officers were that they had illegally detained a person Tallivella Srinivasa Rao for about 25 days without recording any statement or producing him before any competent court and he was subjected to custodial violence.

The government proposed to drop the prosecution against the accused police officers on the ground that a departmental enquiry is proposed against them and this would meet the ends of justice.

Justice Dharma Rao, while allowing the writ petition filed by Srinivasa Rao, observed that the departmental enquiry and criminal trial against a person for certain specific charges of criminal misconduct cannot be considered on the same footing.

In fact, neither departmental enquiry can substitute a criminal trial nor it is intended for that purpose.

The judge observed that the government did not apply its mind to the seriousness of the charges levelled against the delinquent officers.

14,AP govt ready for talks with Naxals: Goud,"HYDERABAD: Three days after extending the ban on People''s War Group by another year, Andhra Pradesh government expressed on Thursday its readiness to carry forward the dialogue with naxalites to achieve peace in the state.

""We are keen to find a permanent solution through talks. They (Naxal leaders) can come to us any time. We have an open mind,"" Home Minister T Devender Goud told the state assembly.

Virtually throwing the ball into PWG''s court to make the next move, he said the Naxalite outfit, through its emissaries, had informed the government during third round of talks last month that it would make up its mind before July 20 on sending its leaders for direct talk.

The Home Minister was replying to special mentions by floor leaders Y S Rajasekhar Reddy (Congress), Indrasena Reddy (BJP) and N Narasimhaiah (CPI-M) calling for carrying forward the talks with naxals despite some hiccups.

""Our stand has been very clear. We want to continue the dialogue in a conducive atmosphere,"" he said.

The Minister''s assurance comes against the backdrop of growing mutual distrust between PWG and government in the wake of recent police encounters in Karimnagar and Warangal districts in which five naxalite leaders were killed.

Signalling a hardening stand, the government had on July 16 decided to extend the ban on PWG by another year.

15,Dr Reddy's plans push in skincare,"NEW DELHI: Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) is putting in place its strategy to expand its presence in the generics-off patented drug market in Europe. Says COO Satish Reddy, France and Germany are markets of interest. At present, we are exploring the opportunities and potential of these two markets, though nothing has been finalised as yet.Back home, Rs 1,557 crore company is also planning a big-ticket expansion in the Dermatology (skincare) segment. The company has plans to launch off-patented generics drugs in this segment (a combination of tablets and creams) along with the existing product Mintop-Forte cream. Dermatology is a growth segment and has become a high-interest area of the company, Reddy said.Reddy's planned entry into the two European markets will be in therapeutic areas - ranging from cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, anti-infective, central nervous system. The particular segment(s) will be decided later, after study of these two markets.Reddy said DRL would explore a combination of two strategies - either acquisitions of generics companies and their brands in these two markets or developing own off-patented drugs for launch in these countries. In case of an acquisition, DRL would use its receipts from ADR issue. Right now, we don't have an acquisition plan in place. We are consolidating our position in the UK after buying out BMS Laboratories. BMS acquisition will also help us as an entry point to Europe, Reddy said. Earlier this year, DRL acquired BMS Labs and its subsidiary Meridian Helthcare at 9.05 million pounnd.He added that DRL has dropped its earlier plan to acquire generic firms in the US as valuations were too high. Brazil is an area of interest and we are studying this market. Reddy said, with the acquired 6 dental brands of Group Pharmaceutical , DRL is eyeing a leadership position in the fast-growing segment.
