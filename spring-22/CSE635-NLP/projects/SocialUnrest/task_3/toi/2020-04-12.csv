0,Contract farming - New recipe for diversification,"PATHANKOT: While the plan for diversification of agriculture in kandi areas is being implemented in a big way with the Gurdaspur adminstration setting up farmers'' councils and information centres in the 14 blocks of the district, the Integrated Wastelands Development Project (IWDP), a World-Bank assisted project of the Punjab government, too is laying stress on multi-crop contract farming with the active participation of the Punjab Agro Foodgrains Corporation Ltd.

Initially, the stress was on improving the output of traditional crops, particularly wheat and maize. Experts claim that the IWDP had resulted in increasing the productivity of wheat by 14 per cent, from 1,549 kg per hectare to 1,750 kg per hectare. Under the programme, the cultivation of spring maize, spring sunflower, Kharif castor, Kharif and Kharif Basmati is being encouraged.

A high-level IWDP team visited Shahpur Kandi recently and held meetings with beneficiaries (self-help groups) and experts to review the progress of the ongoing project. The team stressed on diversifying to crops which give better returns. During his recent visit to Gurdaspur, Punjab agriculture director R K Rampal stressed on the need for increasing the area under Basmati under the contract farming scheme.

A four-day workshop was organised recently in which experts and beneficiaries took part. Farmers were told to make their own compost and go in for organic farming. The farmers were also trained in making vermin compost, the intitial technological know-how is being provided by the Punjab Agricultural University centre at Gurdaspur and ATMA, which has adopted Gurdaspur district.

According to both ATMA director G S Nigger and the IWDP office at Pathankot, plans are afoot for conducting field demonstrations of high value crops. According to officials, marketing linkage has been established especially in the case of floriculture. The emphasis is on growing marigold and wild marigold. They said contract farming was the only way out to bring farmers out of the wheat-paddy cycle.

1,Hameed assures CM on party's support,"KANPUR: Minister for rural engineering services (RES), Kokab Hameed, said that the Rashtriya Lok Dal had no problem with the working of the state government. Terming the ongoing ''CD-series'' of the Samajwadi Party as cheap politics, he asked the party to adopt fair means to come to power.

Prior to the ''Kisan Rally'' in Kakvan, he was in the city on Saturday. Talking to reporters, Hameed said that within two years the RES would compete with the public works department (PWD).

""RES has done well in the last eight months. The work undertaken in 14 districts under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, for financial year 2002-03, was mostly complete.

For the new financial year 2003-04, Hameed said, ""a proposal of Rs 259 crore has been send to the Central government for the construction of 987kms of road.""

Around 65 villages will be inter-connected under the project. He said that there was no short cut for the work in the department as, ""a technical audit committee (TAC) keeps a watch on the quality of the construction work.""

Expressing his happiness over the fact that the department had so received positive results from the TAC, he said that the RES was also responsible of constructing buildings in the rural and urban areas. In Kanpur nagar, the department has taken up project to construct bhawans at 48 places.

He also said that the state government had approved the installation of the statue of Chaudhary Charan Singh at Ghanta Ghar.

2,6-member team to take policy decision in V-C's absence,"PATIALA: In a surprise move, vice-chancellor (V-C) of Punjabi University, Patiala, SS Boparai passed an order on April 10 to constitute a six member college to take policy decision during his 10-day leave from April 11 to 20. This team would keep deputy registrar/PA to the V-C informed accordingly.

The teachers nominated by the V-C to constitute the said college are UC Singh, dean academic, DS Sandhu, director public relations, SPS Virdi, dean colleges, Baldev Singh, professor in-charge (exams), and HS Rose, Professor of Zoology.

As per this order, there will be six V-Cs for 10 days at the Punjabi University. Apart from PVC, the name of dean students was excluded from this so-called college. He also mentioned in his orders that the deans, directors and PVC would attend their normal work.

Constituting a college to perform V-Câ€™s functions is without any precedent not only in this university but in any other university of India as well.

Commenting on it, president of Forum for Educational Action and Reforms Amarjit Singh Dhillon termed it as unprecedented but a queer order as there was no such provision in the University Calendar.

During the absence of the V-C, there is lot of examination work that include 13 papers of BA/BSc Part-I, 15 papers of BA/ BSc Part II, 16 papers of Part III, four papers of BCom and 10 subjects of MA Part II.

3,Mann seeks changes in export policy,"LUDHIANA: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Mann president and a member of Parliament from Sangrur Simranjit Singh Mann, on Saturday, sought drastic changes in the export policy failing which the farming community would not be able to tide over the financial crisis.

Addressing media persons during a press conference here, Mann said the problem had reached an alarming level in view of unremunerative prices thereby pushing the state economy under severe strain.

Claiming to have raised the matter pertaining to potato growers in the Parliament, Mann rued the lack of any initiative by the state government so far.

Talking about the plight of border area farmers, Mann alleged non-payment of compensation to these farmers as landmines have not been removed still. He expressed surprise that farmers are still being sent power bills for the agricultural land under control of the Army.

Claiming to have submitted a memorandum to the President to commute the death sentence of Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, the Sikh leader said that his party had appealed to the Switzerland government not to repatriate four Sikhs Jasvir Singh, Karan Singh, Dalip Singh and Harminder Singh Khalsa who are accused of hijacking a plane and are staying in that country for the last eight years.

The government organisation deciding cases of political asylum in that country has already been formally approached in this regard, he added.

Mann warned the state government to put an immediate ban on the anti-Sikh activities of Divya Jyoti Jagran Sansthan led by controversial godman Ashutosh Maharaj.

He criticised the government for backing out of assurance given to the Minorities Commission of India in this regard.

4,'Error' sparked off ethnic riot at Shillong,"SHILLONG: It was a ''wrong'' territorial nomenclature which is believed to have sparked off an ethnic riot between Hmars and Dimasas in the North Cachar hills. Last week, more than 30 people were killed and several thousands were rendered homeless in a series of clashes.

Residents of NC Hills said that the tension had begun to rise when the Dimasa Halam Daoga, the Dimasa armed outfit, entered into a ceasefire with the Centre in January. People could not help but compare these events with the unfolding developments in the neighbourhood such as the granting of the Bodoland Territorial Council following negotiations with the Bodoland Liberation Tigers, the Bodo armed group.

This was followed ''ominously'' with a resolution from the ruling North Cachar Hills Autonomous District Council, which sought to alter the ethnically neutral term ''North Cachar Hills Autonomous District Council'' into the culturally loaded term ''Dima Hallali Autonomous District Council,'' thus all but giving a political stamp of approval to the idea of the NC Hills as being the homeland of the Dimasa people ie Dimasa Hallali; and sparking off fear and unease among the other tribes and communities within those limits.

Birat Langthasa, Dimasa leader and executive member of the NCHADC said there did seem to be apprehensions in the minds of people over this resolution seeking to rename the council.

""But we have nothing against other tribes and communities, whether Hmar, Kuki, Karbi or any others. How can we even think of throwing out these people who are part and parcel of this place, where will they go, they are from here only."" he said.

He admitted however, that the nomenclature they had chosen could have been disturbing to the other non-Dimasa communities. ""Yes, for this reason there is a sort of rethinking going on about the name.""

5,Buddha appeals for fair panchayat elections,"KOLKOTA: West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhatttacharjee created a flutter in political circles on Saturday by virtually admitting the Oppositions charges that CPM activists were forcibly preventing Trinamul Congress, BJP and Congress candidates from filing nominations for the ensuing panchayat polls in the state slated for May 11.

With barely a day remaining for filing of nominations, Bhattacharjee appealed to Left activists to restrain themselves from indulging in such activities. The Congress and the BJP hailed the cmâ€™s stand. But the Trinamul described it as eye wash. The CPM, however, maintained that opposition candidates had never been prevented from filing nominations and that absurd charges were being raised as people were refusing to contest as Opposition candidates.

""I have received complaints that in some constituencies, the opposition candidates were not being able to file their nominations. We have never supported such actions,"" the chief minister said in a fax message sent to all newspaper offices.

""I appeal to all Left activists so that no such incident takes place in future. I have also alerted the police and the administration to intervene in such cases. This is absolutely essential for democracy and for a free and fair poll,"" he said.

Claiming that no such incident had occurred in the state and that there was no difference between the Bhattacharjee and his party on the issue, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said that the chief minister had merely performed his duty as he had received complaints from the opposition. ""As chief minister, it was obligatory on his part to issue such a statement. But we maintain that the opposition is raising such rubbish charges because they are not getting enough candidates for the polls. They know that they are going to lose the panchayat elections,"" Biswas said.

Claiming that the chief ministerâ€™s statement had vindicated her party''s charges, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, however, described this stand as mere eye wash. ""Why did he make the statement only a day before filing of nominations comes to an end ? The delay is deliberate,"" Banerjee fumed.

The Trinamul chief said her party was regularly sending reports on CPMâ€™s terror to Union home minister L K Advani. ""I talked to him in detail even on Friday night,"" she said. She, however, ruled out possibilities that the chief minister could have acted under pressure from the Centre. The Congress and the BJP congratulated Bhattacarjee for taking a brave stand.

6,Vat draft rules are retrograde: experts,"PUNE: Sales tax and income-tax experts from across Maharashtra have termed the soon-to-beintroduced value-added tax (Vat) retrograde and archaic.

At a one-day seminar titled ''The Maharashtra value-added tax act 2002 and rules'', organised by the Income-tax, sales tax practitioners'' association, Pune, and the Sales tax practitioners'' association of Maharashtra, experts were unanimous in their opinion that Vat rules were retrograde.

In his inaugural address, chief guest Vikram Sarda, the Nasikbased president of the Mahratta chamber of commerce, industries and agriculture, pointed out how Vat was merely replacing the old sales tax act.

Sarda said the draft rules provided too much power to the government, which could lead to corruption. ""If we have to get a good Act in place, we need to urgently amend the draft,"" he said.

Highlighting the more obvious retrograde features of the draft, Sarda pointed to the idea of check posts at every state border.

""This can only lead to harassment. In European countries, there are no check posts even at national borders. Why then are we insisting on check posts at inter-state borders,"" he questioned. Sarda also criticised the rule which enabled government officers to audit traders. ""What is the purpose of doing this. This means there is a lack of trust in the trader''s auditor, who is also a professional,"" he said.

The provision of a jail term in case of a failure to file returns was also, according to Sarda, a retrograde step. ""According to government records, only 11 traders have been punished in such a manner in the last 50 years. It makes no sense to retain this rule in progressive times,"" he said.

Mumbai-based legal expert S S Gaitonde too was critical of the draft. Gaitonde, who chaired one of the technical sessions on the subject, said Vat was just a misnomer.

""It is just another form of sales tax,""Gaitonde said, calling for the removal of all barriers such as central sales tax and state sales tax. ""It would have made more sense if the planners had emulated the developed countries in this matter,"" he said.

8,Stalemate in Congress over RS elections,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: All India Congress Committee (AICC) observers Ghulam Nabi Azad and R K Dhawan on Saturday failed to arrive at a truce with party veteran K Karunakaran over the fielding of a rebel against official nominees for the Rajya Sabha elections.

The Karunakaran faction has fielded Kodot Govindan Nair against the two official candidates, Vayalar Ravi and Thennala Balakrishna Pillai. Earlier, the party had suspended Nair for six years for defiance.

Dhawan said talks with the Karunakaran and AK Antony factions will continue on Sunday. The elections are scheduled to be held on Monday. The Karunakaran faction claims loyalty of 26 MLAs out of 62 in the House.

Karunakaran asserted that there was no question of his leaving the Congress and joining any other party in the backdrop of this confrontation.

Reacting to NCP leader Sharad Pawar''s statement that a senior Congress leader from Kerala would shortly join his party, Karunakaran said, ""I will not join any other party under any circumstances and there is no need for me to do so.""

The AICC observers said, ""The issue of the rebel candidate will be settled in the interest of the party. The purpose is that both the (official) Congress candidates should get through. To achieve this goal, we will take every leader into confidence. We will discuss with leaders and MLAs.""

Azad said: ""We don''t think there is going to be any problem. This is our internal matter and this is not for the first time this sort of thing has happened in Kerala.""

10,Baby gets two-inch cut during delivery,"NEW DELHI: A gynaecologist at Guru Gobind Singh hospital injured a baby with a scalpel during a caesarean delivery on Monday morning. There was a two-inch cut on the left side of the babyâ€™s face and a surgery strip had to be used on the the wound. The incident occurred after doctors decided to operate on Rajwanti (20) who was admitted to the hospital on Sunday, when she went into labour.

This was her first delivery. Rajwanti was able to feed her baby only once after which the baby was shifted to the nursery. He was also reportedly put on antibiotics to prevent an infection from spreading. The case was referred to different departments, including general surgery. The 100-bed hospital in Raghubir Nagar, west Delhi, is run by the city government.

The incident has left Rajwanti distraught. â€˜â€˜We were planning file a complaint but were told that the cut was small,â€™â€™ she said. The baby was referred to Kalawati Saran hospital on Wednesday evening, seemingly due to a stomach problem.

Such cases are not new to this hospital. A few months ago, another baby was injured during a caesarean delivery and had to be referred to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital. Hospital medical superintendent Dr B C Patnaik said he was not aware of the incidents. â€˜â€˜But such cases should not happen,â€™â€™ he said.

11,Delay in biotech park confounds farmers,"CHANDIGARH: The delay in setting up a biotechnology park, which would act as a nodal centre to spur the future growth of Punjabâ€™s agriculture, has confounded farmers and industrialists alike.

Progressive farmers are asking why Punjab, whose economy relies heavily on agriculture, is going slow on technological advancement and setting up a biotechnology centre. Questions are being raised as to why there is no money with the state to set up the biotechnology park, which would potentially generate huge resources.

The setting up of the biotechnology park has remained just a proposal for the last three years. â€˜â€˜The union department of biotechnology (DBT) is to give a Rs 10-crore grant for setting up the park. However, a condition was laid that the Punjab government has to show a contribution equivalent to the money to be released by the DBT. Somehow, there have been delays in that,â€™â€™ said SS Marwaha, director, biotechnology, Punjab State Council for Science and Technology (PSCST).

Marwaha said that industrialists in the hosiery business in Ludhiana were willing to invest money in biotechnology industries keeping in view the fact that hosiery was fetching diminishing returns,while biotechnology was a â€˜â€˜sunrise industryâ€™â€™.

However, the matter is likely to make progress by April-end with industrialists offering to enter into partnerships with the government for utilisation of the technologies developed at the park. The biotechnology park envisages a cluster approach with a biotechnology incubation centre and various industries offering to employ the technologies tested, validated and developed at the incubation centre. The PSCST would offer feasibility studies for new technologies, provide detailed project reports, technical support and marketing assistance.

â€˜â€˜We have offered to set up the incubation centre and bring in 10 to 15 industries within the biotechnology park complex. However, we expect the government to provide the land and technologies for us to work on,â€™â€™ said Gurmeet Singh Bhatia, vicepresident, Mohali Industries Association.

A Hoshiarpur-based progressive farmer, Bhagwant Singh Ahluwalia, said that they would welcome any move by the government which makes it possible to increase productivity. â€˜â€˜Increased productivity would lead to lower costs of production, which in turn would reduce the burden on the common man,â€™â€™ he said.

Officials and farmers feel that the government is not following a future-oriented agricultural policy for the state. A senior government officer pointed out that the government continued to refer to agriculture as â€˜â€˜farmingâ€™â€™ despite a change in its nomenclature to â€˜â€˜industryâ€™â€™.

â€˜â€˜Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, which are traditionally not agriculturedriven economies, are forging ahead with an industrial approach to agriculture, whereas Punjab, which hinges its existence on the green revolution, seems to be complacent and mired in petty confusion instead of a positive â€˜do itâ€™ approach,â€™â€™ said the officer.
