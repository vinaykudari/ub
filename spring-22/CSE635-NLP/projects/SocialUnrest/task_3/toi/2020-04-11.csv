0,Chhani villagers plan toll protest,"VADODARA: Plans for agitation to protest collection of toll from residents of villages located in the vicinity of the Chhani railway overbridge gained momentum, with the villagers forming a common front to conduct an agitation over the issue.

The villagers plan to form a human chain on Saturday to protest against the collection of toll tax from them.

Leaders of villages like Dashrath, Chhani, Padamla and Ranoli, located on the national highway and near the overbridge, have formed the Vadodara Gramya Nagrik Hitrakshak Samiti (VGNHS) to conduct the agitation. These villages have, on several occasions, raised objections against the collection of toll and argued that they should be exempted from the same. A memorandum over the issue was submitted to the district administration here recently.

Last weekâ€™s incident of alleged manhandling of a resident of Dashrath village, Jitendra Patel, by police officers and security personnel of the toll booth has aggravated the situation. Nilesh Patel, a functionary of VGNHS, said that the villagers would now raise the demand for a service route so that they can bypass the overbridge.

â€œWe will form a human chain and the agitation will continue till the issue is solved. The purpose of the newly-formed organisation is to bring people together for the agitation,â€� Nilesh said.

Senior police officials visited the over-bridge on Friday and met the leaders conducting the agitation and inquired about their demands and the future course of action. Sources said that the police is taking no chances after two successive incidents of vandalisation at the toll plaza located on the bridge.

The villagers are also demanding action against Chhani police inspector Bhagirathsinh Jadeja for his alleged misbehaviour with Jitendra Patel. Nilesh said that the demand for action against those involved in the incident had been raised, but was yet to be attended to.

Jadeja, meanwhile, said that the incident was being blown out of proportion. â€œIt is true that we had to physically lift the person from the place as he was obstructing traffic and leading to inconvenience to commuters. However, he was not beaten up,â€� Jadeja said.

1,Traders protest against flyover,"LUCKNOW: Hundreds of traders of Mawaiyya main market downed their shutters to protest against the construction of a flyover at Mawaiyya crossing from Friday morning on the ground that the flyover would hurt the business prospects of the market. The agitated traders chased away the employees of the bridge corporation who arrived for levelling and measurement survey.

General secretary of the Mawaiyya Vyapar Mandal Rohit Sharma told TNN that about a week ago when the team of surveyors had come to the site to start work, they were requested to at least show the map and plan of the flyover in order to provide the local traders with an idea as to what the prospects of space would be once the construction was complete. However, on Friday morning the officials again surfaced without the map and had to face the ire of the traders who chased them away.

The traders downed their shutters and held a blockade demanding administrative officials to give an assurance that the traders would be shown the plan outlay and the map of the flyover before the construction began in full swing. Rohit Sharma pointed out that the project contarctors had already dug two pits for pillars in the area and the work had been stalled thereafter for reasons unknown. At such a pace, the project is likely to cause problems during the monsoon.

2,Hospital stay likely to pinch more,"BANGALORE: More tax for the pained. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board has slapped city hospitals with a 50 per cent hike in the authorisation fee towards biomedical waste management.

The cess is to ensure minimum hazard due to hospital waste.

This tax is likely to be passed on to the patient.

The waste management fee was hiked from Rs 100 to Rs 150 per bed per annum, in a recently revised structure by the Ministry of Ecology, Environment and Forests.

KSPCB, the regulatory authority, issued notices to hospitals to comply with the new rule by March 31, 2003, or face closure or have power supply cut.

Even as KSPCB officials maintain there has been a sudden rush to catch the deadline, hospital managements do not see any rationale behind adhering to such a rule. â€œWhen private players are involved in collecting, segregating and disposing of hospital waste, what is the contribution of KSPCB towards waste management?â€™â€™ asks the medical superintendent of a leading government hospital.

â€œAnd because government hospitals (84 in the city) are meant to operate for free, the cost is definitely a huge burden on the government exchequer,â€™â€™ the superintendent feels.

However, R. Jayaprakash, environment officer, KSPCB, retorts, â€œThe Board utilises the money for hospital waste monitoring, analyses the samples, conducts seminars and awareness programmes on the significance of effective hospital waste management.â€™â€™

All said, the burden will fall on patients, admit many private hospital managers. â€œThe hike is too huge to be ignored. The existing 300-bed private hospitals will try to recover the cost from patients or cut their resources,â€™â€™ the medical director of a reputed private hospital says. He felt that private hospitals are now in the process of working out a cost rationalisation scheme.

Bangalore apart, hospitals at Mysore, Mangalore, Gulbarga, Hubli-Dharwad and Belgaum will also have to comply with the new rule. The implications of a 50 per cent hike is higher for hospitals with a larger number of beds.

However, in the larger interest of a clean environment, consumers may want to pay, but that would depend on how accountable KSPCB is in discharging its duty and bringing about a visible change, feels a spokesperson of a large private hospital.

4,CM neglecting farmers: Cong,"HYDERABAD: Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy has maintained that his padaytra was aimed at soothing the people and lend a helping hand in tackling the drought in the state.

Addressing a public meeting at Tandur in the neighbouring Rangareddy district on Friday, Rajasekhara Reddy accused the chief minister of neglecting farmers who are committing suicide due to failure of crops and consequent debt burden. He said even cattle are suffering for want of fodder, â€œbut the government is doing little to mitigate the suffering of the people.â€�

Starting from Manneguda, where he halted for night, the CLP leader covered 22 km on the third day of his 60-day â€˜Praja Prasthanamâ€™. He touched Gattepalli, Manasanpalli and Kandanelli and interacted with local villagers.

According to information reaching here, YSR received tumultuous response and hundreds of people lined up on the way to cheer him. People from interior areas turned up in good numbers to greet the opposition leader, who was accompanied by over 500 Congress workers, including MPs and MLAs.

After walking for 64 km in three days, Rajasekhara Reddy developed blisters on his right foot, but it did not deter him from continuing his padayatra on Friday. When the CLP leader halted for lunch in the afternoon at a make shift tent on way to Tandur, a doctor accompanying him applied anti-septic cream and after a brief rest, YSR resumed his walk.

Following the doctorsâ€™ advise, Rajasekhara Reddy limited his speeches and started interacting with locals more. He was stopped by women on a couple of occasions, who showed him the dried up crops because of power problem. He assured them that he would take up the matter with the concerned officials.

5,It's a long weekend for govt offices,"PUNE: It happens only in India. Starting Friday, government offices across the state will remain closed for five consecutive days.

While Friday''s off was on account of Ramnavmi, Saturday and Sunday are weekly offs and on Monday and Tuesday, it is Ambedkar Jayanti and Mahavir Jayanti respectively.

But that''s not all. After two working days on Wednesday and Thursday, government departments will again remain closed on account of Good Friday.

This may be a long weekend for government employees, but it is bound to add to the woes of the common man, who is already harassed because of the slow pace of the government machinery. (In Western countries, if a general holiday comes along with weekly offs, it is called a ''super'' weekend).

In the 92 days of March, April and May, government and Pune municipal corporation (PMC) offices will remain closed for 30 days, including the 10 days in March when government offices stayed shut on various accounts, including Muharram, Holi and Mahashivratri.

In May too, besides weekly offs, government offices will remain closed on May 1, which is Maharashtra Day, on May 15 on account of Bakri Id, and on May 16 for Buddha Purnima.

Speaking to TNN, Narayan Joshi, general-secretary of the Maharashtra state government employees'' union, said he had submitted a proposal to the government that there should be only three general holidays - Independence Day, Republican Day and Maharashtra Day - and all holidays given on religious grounds should be cancelled.

However, for these cancelled holidays, government employees should be compensated by increasing the number of casual leaves, he suggests. ""This will ensure that people''s works are not affected,"" he added.

As school examinations ended earlier this week, many government employees are using this five-day opportunity to avail a cool relief at hill stations such as Mahabaleshwar and Matheran. Those employees who are not basically from the city have gone to their native places.

However, while government employees enjoy their ""super super weekend"", citizens who have applied for various certificates, licences and permits will have to wait for a few more days.

No senior government officer was available to tell how they planned to remove the backlog of work created due to these holidays. PMC public relations officer Sunil More said the PMC''s ward offices will function on all these holidays, except on Sunday. ""Citizens will, therefore, not be put to inconvenience,"" he claimed.

""Citizens can register their complaints regarding water supply, garbage disposal, licence renewal, property and other taxes etc. at their respective ward offices. All such complaints will be addressed immediately. Birth and death certificates will also be issued as usual,"" he added.

6,Reality debunks govt claims,"MUSHAHARI (Muzaffarpur): Dahaur Manjhi, a musahar by caste, has never got any foodgrain on the basis of a red card he got in 1997. Except for a damaged thatched house and about one kattha of homestead land provided by the government, Dahaur and nine other members of his family have no means of livelihood.

All the earning members of the family being daily wage earners, they virtually go without food on the days they have no work. Kerosene oil given to them on red card does not help them procure food. The PDS dealer of the area, Suresh Ram, throws away the red card whenever a demand for rice and wheat is made, says Dahaur.

Another red card holder, Pawittar Manjhi was lucky as he used to get 20 kg wheat and 10 kg rice from the PDS shop every month till last year. But he got only 25 kg foodgrain in January this year and has got nothing since then. Dhongal Manjhi complained of getting only kerosene, while Babulal Manjhi, Lalan Manjhi, Gonaur Manjhi and Rambriksha Manjhi, all having four to five members in their families, said all they got from the government is a damaged thatched house and one kattha of homestead land each.

The musahar tola, about 3 km north of Musahari block office and a part of Bochaha assembly constituency represented by revenue minister Ramai Ram, has 36 families and all of them have similar complaints. They, however, claim that so long their PDS dealer was Jagannath Singh they had few problems but the present dealer, Suresh Ram, not only refuses to give foodgrain but also abuses them.

Although all the musahars are landless and dependent on daily wages, none of them claimed to be possessing an Antyoday Card. All of them have red cards valid between 1997 and 2006. Their red cards are in real bad shape and they have forgotten when they last got wheat and rice from the PDS shop.

Hulas Sahni of another tola of Musahari panchayat, however, said he is an Antyodaya Card holder but added that the allotment of foodgrain has been reduced for the last three months. One Munshi Rai of the same locality complained of irregularities and favouritism in the preparation of the list of the Antyoday scheme beneficiaries in Musahari block.

Muzaffarpur DM Amrit Lal Meena informed that altogether 45,775 families of the district, including 2,788 of Musahari block alone, have been identified as Antyodaya scheme beneficiaries. The monthly allotment of wheat for the beneficiary families has been increased from 6,866 quintals to 9,612 quintals and rice from 4,577 quintals to 6,408 quintals this year. Each beneficiary family has to receive 21 kg wheat and 14 kg rice per month.

There has not been any scarcity of foodgrain for the Antyodaya scheme, the DM claimed, adding that no stock is allowed to lapse.

The DM said the licences of at least 30 PDS dealers have been cancelled or suspended during last one year on complaints of blackmarketing of Antyodaya foodgrain. Action under the EC Act has also been taken against some of them, he said.

7,"Scrap disinvestment ministry, says BMS","NEW DELHI: In what could be an embarrassment to the government, RSS labour outfit Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) has demanded that the disinvestment ministry be scrapped and the group of ministers and secretaries be unbundled.

Outlining the ill-effects of disinvestment at its central working committee meeting in Satara, BMS has also demanded that government take over privatised PSUs like BALCO and Modern Foods and make it clear that profit-making PSUs would not be privatised.

BMS has also come down heavily against N K Singh committee report on foreign direct investment, exhorting the government to reject FDI in theory and practice. What the union finds intriguing is the fact that while FDI is being encouraged, the government is neglecting and discouraging Indian investors.

""The government wants domestic savings to go for consumption, creating a market demand. This is suicidal, for which the country would have to pay a heavy social cost. Foreign market would wean away the Indian production engine,"" BMS said in its resolution.

The union also found it surprising that while the government was yet to accept the N K Singh report, planners, bureaucrats and ministers had already swung into action.

BMS has also demanded that bills on unorganised sector workers, social security and workers participation in management be immediately passed by Parliament. Also, the labour management relations bill be placed before the next Indian Labour Conference.

The union has opposed the government move to introduce night work for women. It has reminded the centre of pre-conditions set by the International Labour Organisation and Madras High Court which includes adequate safeguards, transportation etc.

8,Mayawati misusing govt funds: Samajwadi Party,"LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party on Friday charged Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati with misusing government funds worth Rs 8 crore for organising the party''s ''pardafash rally''.

""The chief minister is blatantly misusing government funds and machinery for organising the BSP rally,"" senior Samajwadi Party leader Ahmed Hasan told reporters here.

The rally had provided a ready excuse to the BSP for extorting money, he said, adding the largescale preparation had caused immense hardships to common people as several houses and trees had been pulled down to widen the road around the venue of the rally.

Hasan took strong exception to Mayawati''s utterances against Hindu gods and goddesses in the CD released by the Samajwadi Party recently and also alleged that senior BJP leader and Urban Development Minister Lalji Tandon was grabbing the Waqf land in Lucknow.

Both Mayawati and Tandon were hurting the religious sentiments of the people, he added.

9,"Police fire on protestors in J&K, 1 killed","JAMMU: A youth was killed and another injured when police opened fire to disperse a crowd protesting the stabbing of a businessman at Jakh village in Jammu district, police said on Saturday.

Tension gripped Jakh village on Friday evening when a group of people, led by one Kaka Shah and NC activist Hazara Begum, attacked businessman Chander Shekhar with knives causing him grievous injuries, police said.

10,Nawaz asks govt to submit Musharraf's amends,"ISLAMABAD: Deposed Premier Nawaz Sharif-led Pakistan Muslim League (N) has said the government should submit the constitutional amendments for validation to Parliament, which has been declared by a High Court as the supreme authority to decide on the fate of the amendments.

The Lahore High Court (LHC) judgment has affirmed the supremacy of parliament in constitutional matters and the government should stop saying the amendments were part of the constitution, PML-N Acting President Javed Hashmi has said.

He said the court''s remarks had thoroughly rebutted the government argument that the constitution already stood amended, and the opposition should move a private bill if it wanted to amend it further.

The Lahore High Court, while dismissing a petition questioning the legality of the amendments, said Parliament being the supreme body should decide over its fate.

The court''s judgement delivered few days ago evoked mixed reactions. The Judgement by a division bench while maintaining that Parliament was right forum to decide over it also said that supreme court has empowered Musharraf to amend the constitution, while endorsing his military coup of 1999.

The Lahore High Court at the same time said that being a subordinate court it abides by the appex court''s ruling. The High Court, while dismissing the petition has refrained from stating whether the Legal Framework Order (LFO) which incorporated the amendments was valid or not and left it to Parliament to decide.

11,India Development Initiative to aid developing nations: Jalan,"WASHINGTON: India is planning to give grants or project assistance to developing countries in Africa, South Asia and other developing nations through the ""India Development Initiative"" scheme, Reserve Bank Governor Bimal Jalan said on Saturday.

Addressing the spring meeting of IMF, Jalan said a debt relief package has been envisaged in the Union Budget 2003-04, under which India would be writing off all the official dues of the highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs), owing to overdue payments.

""We are ready to operationalise our commitments to fully participate in the HIPC initiative,"" he said at the meeting of International Monetary and Financial committee here.

Jalan reiterated India''s commitment to fight against the abuses of the financial system including money laundering and terrorism financing.

He said the international community should focus on the role of offshore financial centres, tax havens, excessive bank secrecy and oversight of the end use of funds donated to charities.

At the same time, he said that the apprehension that the new methodology may be unduly intrusive, needs to be allayed to facilitate voluntary compliance.

Emphasizing that the voice of developing countries in the international financial institutions is ""weak"", Jalan called for raising the quota share of the developing countries appropriately to match their growing importance in the world economy as well as to provide them a larger profile in the governance of the IMF.

Reform of the international financial architecture, he said, will not be complete without changes in the way the Fund and other international financial institutions operate. ""The developing countries have been marginalised for far too long without adequate representation in the Fund''s decision-making process,"" he said.

""A comprehensive reform of the distribution of Fund quotas (share holding) is urgently needed to better reflect the changes in the global economy, notably the increased relative position of emerging market economies.""

Jalan urged that any revision in the quota formula should take into consideration the Gross National Product or Gross Domestic Product computed on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis to ensure that the quota size truly reflects the economic position of the member countries.

Under PPP, India is the world''s fourth largest economy and China the second largest.

Under the current formula, the Indian economy is not considered large enough even to merit a seat in the Executive Board on its own. India was one of the top five permanent members in the early years but was stripped of that and now has a Board seat combining the quotas of India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Analysing the difficult global economy, Jalan said that the pace of recovery in industrial countries has lost effect of the bursting of the equity bubble.

Trade growth is lower, capital flows are declining and there is pressure on corporate and financial institutions, in particular insurance and pension funds. (

Labour market conditions are soft. While global fixed investment has started picking up, though slowly, there is a possibility that feeble consumption growth could imperil the fragile recovery process. It is indeed worrisome, he said, to witness the profound erosion of the equity markets since 2000.

Bond markets are hesitant and the US dollar is depreciating. The asset price bubble continues to influence the developments in both financial markets and real economy.

Consequent to geopolitical tensions and supply irritants, oil prices may fluctuate sharply, bringing further volatility to commodities markets.

In these difficult times, Jalan said, the international community should be in a state of vigilance and preparedness to take timely and appropriate actions both at policy and operational levels, to ease the impacts of any adverse shocks on countries, which are vulnerable and maintain financial stability.

He urged expansion of the scope of the Compensatory Financing Facility to oil-importing countries, allowing them to draw finance almost on an automatic basis, linked to oil price movements.

Jalan noted with disappointment that despite the world economy benefiting from earlier free trade initiatives, progress has been relatively uneven across countries and markets. Trade barriers particularly affect the poorer countries.

Freer trade in agriculture through elimination of distorting subsidies, would bring sizeable benefits for both developed and developing countries, he said.

Committed leadership from industrial countries will be crucial to the success of the Doha Trade Round. India, he said, is committed to making the WTO negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda a success.

He said the Fund''s Surveillance would be effective with an appropriate balance among the considerations of comprehensiveness, frequency, timeliness and accuracy.

Jalan said that while India appreciates the rationale for international standards and codes, ""We strongly believe that its implementation must remain voluntary, with due consideration to differences in country-specific circumstances and priorities in terms of the level of economic development.""

""Member countries should not be pressured into adopting standards and codes.""

On publishing Fund assessments of countries, Jalan said that enhanced transparency, both on the part of members and the Fund itself, will facilitate better assessments of risks by borrowers and creditors.

He praised the Fund policies that enhance the transparency of the Fund''s operations through publication of a variety of documents.

12,Air-India puts off decision on selection of aircraft,"MUMBAI: The Air-India board on Saturday put off its much-awaited decision on the selection of 10 medium capacity long range aircraft (MCLR).

Pitching for the $1.5 billion order are the two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world - the US'' Boeing and the European Airbus.

The board members sought 7-10 days time to go through the technical evaluation committee report, which was presented to the members prior to the board meeting, a company spokesman said.

Both Boeing, with its 777-200, and Airbus, with A340, are vying for the aircraft deal once again. The aircraft are to be in a three class configuration - 12 first class, 28 in business and 247 in economy, making it a total 287 seats, for acquisition over a five year period beginning this fiscal.

Last year, Indian Airlines board approved for an all Airbus mixed fleet of aircraft consisting A 319s, A321s and A320s worth over $2 billion.

""Considering the huge investment that is going to be made over the next five years, the board members sought time to decide on the issue and seek clarifications, if any, from the committee"", Public Relations Director Jitendra Bhargava said while briefing newspersons after the board meeting.

The technical committee, under the chairmanship of Capt M K Hathi, operations director, submitted their report today and a decision was expected considering that the MCLR proposal has been hanging fire for quite some time.

13,Officials working hard for CM's 'pardafash' rally,"KANPUR: Twenty-four hours before UP CM Mayawati''s ''pardafash'' rally in Lucknow, the district administration here is virtually in a battle mode, pulling out all stops to ''transport'' BSP supporters to the state capital. Not surprisingly on the 108-km Kanpur-Lucknow highway, public transport like buses, tempos and even trucks are nowhere to be seen.

The reason is simple. With BSP cadres pitching in with their might to ferry maximum people for the rally, it has been left to officials to arrange for their transport. With an informal communique to all DMs and police chiefs in this connection, the khaki might is out on the roads, literally.

Kanpur has an ""official quota"" of arranging 280 buses, confided a senior district official, confirming the drive to ""pool in vehicles"" was being spearheaded by the regional transport office which, with all out help from the police, is busy impounding vehicles with impunity.

The 40-plus burly Sarnam Singh, a bus driver for a private transport company, told TNN that he had been served an ""advance ultimatum"" to ""book his vehicle for BSP activists"".

Relaxing at a roadside ''dhaba'' near Ajgain, he fumed at the police highhandedness and alleged that a police sub-inspector had impounded several private vehicles for the rally.

Smug officials confirm that all the major highway police stations and outposts had been asked to ensure ""sizeable participation"" of vehicles for ''Behenji''s'' rally.

Rajnish Tewari, a BSP activist and prabhari from Aryanagar for the rally, admitted taking services of regional transport officer Ashok Kumar in getting the vehicles.

""Wo hamari bahut madad kar rahe hain"" he said. When contacted Kumar initially refused that he was coercing people into providing transport to the BSP activists, but later conceded that he was facilitating it. This, he hastened to add, would be purely on ''payment'' basis. With senior and middle-rung police officials busy in arranging vehicles for the rally, other the obvious casualty seems to be policing in this crime torn region.

Policemen have been pulled out from various districts here and have been dispatched to Lucknow. According to a reliable source, 81 sub-inspectors, 350 constables, 10 head constables, 3 lady sub-inspectors, ten lady constables and two companies of PAC are being sent for the ''pardafash'' rally from this district.

14,US war policy is driven by oil and dollar: Rajaramon,"BANGALORE: Noted historian and former NASA consultant N.S. Rajaramon Saturday said the US is waging a war against Iraq only to gain firmer control of oil wealth there and defend the dollar as the main currency of oil trade against euro.

Speaking to reporters, he said the US policy in South Asia is driven by these considerations, and not terrorism.

Should the dollar lose its position as the dominant world currency â€” a position that it owes to oil trade â€” its military dominance will be hard to maintain.

â€œIn 1999, at Franceâ€™s persuasion, Iraq switched to the euro. Soon, Iran started thinking about switching over to euro and Venezuela, the fourth largest oil producer, began to bypass the dollar in direct trade with several of its customers. Russia is trying to do the same with its European customers. This explains why the US abruptly shifted its attention from the war in Afghanistan to a major war in Iraq,â€™â€™ he said.

America wants to send a clear message to oil-producing nations to stay with the dollar as in the absence of this, US cannot remain a superpower.

â€œWhere are the WMDs the US is talking about? Having decided that the present level of terrorism poses no great threat to its military or economic security, what it really fears is the collapse of the status quo in Pakistan leading to a regime that threatens US interest in West Asia,â€™â€™ he added.
