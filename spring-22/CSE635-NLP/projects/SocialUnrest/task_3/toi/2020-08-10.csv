3,State lawyers vow action on conciliation boards Bill,"KOLKATA: The stateâ€™s lawyers have again threatened an indefinite ceasework in protest against the state governmentâ€™s bid to set up block level conciliation boards.

""If the state Bar Council and Bar associations favour the move, we will start an agitation which may ultimately turn into ceasework,"" state Bar Council chairman Amiya Chatterjee said on Sunday.

Last year, the lawyers were on a 45-day ceasework to protest the court fee hike. The draft â€˜West Bengal Block Level Conciliation Board Bill, 2003â€™ was sent to the Bar Council on July 20.

Its stated aim was ""to set up a board for conciliation of legal disputes in a case at prelitigation stage or at litigation stage at the block level"".

On July 24, copies of the Bill were sent to all 170 Bar associations in the state.

State Bar Council executive chairman Uttam Majumder said: ""All Bar associations oppose the Bill. They favour a strong agitation.""

After receiving opinions from Bar associations, the council will ""organise agitations. If the government is still adamant, we may cease work again,"" Majumder said.

""We have sent a letter to the state government seeking stay of the Bill for two months,"" said Chatterjee.

He added: ""During our movement against court fees we met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. He had told us the idea of the conciliation board was someoneâ€™s brainchild. Let it be kept at that stage. He had assured us the Bill would not be place in the Assembly.""

4,Cong chief's origin not a major issue in polls: Basu,"KOLKATA: Veteran CPM politburo member and former chief minister Jyoti Basu said here on Sunday that Congress president Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin would not be a major political issue during the next Lok Sabha polls.

Basu, who had earlier described Sonia as ""a mere housewife"" and ""uninitiated in politics"" said, ""Now the Congress has chosen her as its leader and she is learning politics.""

In 1996 the veteran Marxist leader had precipitated a major crisis in the CPM by criticising its central committee for refusing to make him Prime Minister. He had described the party''s dogged refusal to join the Centre as a ""historic blunder"".

Basu''s statement on Sunday, telecast on a private TV channel a day before the politburo meeting in New Delhi, sparked off speculation in CPM circles. A section of party leaders felt he might again press for joining the Centre in case the Congress came to power after the next Lok Sabha polls.

CPM state secretary and politburo member Anil Biswas, among those party leaders who had opposed Basu being PM, said the CPM had taken no decision that Sonia would be supported as the prime ministerial candidate.

""There will be no pre-poll alliance or front with the Congress. We will ask the people to vote for the Congress only in those seats where the Left and other democratic forces are not present,"" he said.

CPM insiders said in case Basu pressed for support for Sonia and the CPM''s inclusion in a Congress-led government, the politburo meeting would be a stormy one.

Several senior level posts including directors- soil conservation, agriculture and horticulture are lying vacant for the last several months. The vacancy in these specialised posts have adversely hampered the pace of development in the department.

8,HC asks govt to test Pepsi,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the government to test samples of PepsiCo''s soft drinks for pesticide residues and submit the results in three weeks.

Justice B D Ahmed asked Additional Solicitor General K K Sud to get the samples tested in a government laboratory in response to a petition by Pepsi, which asked the court to direct the government not to rely on the report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and instead conduct its own tests and frame standards.

The petition contended the CSE laboratory has no accreditation and the methods and process adopted in preparing the report were ""suspect"".

Terming the CSE report as ""dubious"", Pepsi said the government department has acted on the report without ascertaining its correctness and directed stoppage of Pepsi''s products.

Requesting the high court to direct the government not to act on the basis of the CSE report alleging presence of pesticides in seven of its products much above the permitted levels as compared with the same products in European Union, Pepsi said there has been barrage of media publicity disparaging its beverages.

The petition has listed Union ministries of health, defence and food processing as respondents.

Other respondents mentioned in the petition are the Bureau of Indian Standards, CSE and its director Sunita Narain.

12,Pak cable operators protest ban on Indian channels,"ISLAMABAD: Terming as ""illogical"" Pakistan government''s ban on telecast of Indian TV channels, Cable Operators Association here has demanded that the government should permit them to air entertainment channels like Star Plus.

There was no justification in continuing the ban when bus links have been established and there was possibility of revival of rail and air links also, the Cable Operators Association President Jabbar A Khan told reporters.

In these circumstances, it was illogical on the part of the government to insist on the ban on Indian channels, he said. The government, he said could perhaps defend the ban on news and propaganda channels but not on entertainment.

""All the cable operators want right now is the permission to air Star Plus and two movies a day. How would it affect the perceptions of Pakistanis about themselves,"" he asked, adding that there was no ban on any Pakistani channel in India.

The ban affected Star Plus, Star News, Zee Cinema, Zee Gold, Sony and B4U.

14,"Over 8,000 govt staff rejoin duty in TN","CHENNAI: Smiles were etched on the faces of employees who returned to work in various offices of the Tamil Nadu government throughout the state, after 40 days of tension.

Some of the employees expressed the hope that the 6,072, who still stay suspended till judicial enquiry, would also be allowed to rejoin. Some of them dodged scribes and rushed towards their office.

An employee at the Panagal Malligai office in Saidapet, without disclosing his identity, said: ""It is a relief to return. What the government could have done was to at least take us back when we came back to work within two days of the strike began (July 2), instead of harassing us. It could have shown little consideration. Strikes take place all over the country. It was no different here.â€™â€™

Among the 6,072 who would undergo judicial enquiry, 2,769 staff are from the Secretariat in Chennai. The Tamil Nadu Secretariat Association President K Pandurangan reiterated his appeal to Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa for reinstating all the dismissed staff and forgiving their mistakes.

The reinstatement of the employees took place under detailed guidelines issued by the government to the district collectors and secretaries of all departments. Ironically, though the employees against whom FIRs were filed under Section (4) of Esma can resume duty at the district level, the same does not apply to those from the Secretariat. The government claims that those from the Secretariat booked under the same section had gone on strike from July 1 itself and had instigated other employees throughout the state to join the strike from July 2.

Meanwhile, the 15,500 newly appointed temporary employees would continue to work for another month until enquiries by the three-panel judge is completed. The panel is expected to be named by Tuesday.

15,Pota point of law in Godhra case,"NEW DELHI: Could the Gujarat government book the Godhra train carnage accused under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota), when the law was not in force at the time of the incident? The Supreme Court will consider this issue on the basis of submissions made by the counsel of four accused in the case.

More than a 100 people have been arrested under the Pota in connection with the case. However, in none of the post-Godhra cases have the accused been booked under the controversial Act.

Salimbhai Abdul Gaffar Shaikh, Mohammed Hussein Abdul Rahim Kalota, Siraj Abdullah Jamsa and Mohammed Abdul Sattar Giteli were all arrested on February 27, 2002 â€” the day the Sabarmati Express was set on fire. They were booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code. Some 11 months later, Pota was invoked against them.

The counsel of the accused said that since the anti-terrorism law was enforced in the state on March 28, 2002, they could not be booked under it. This would violate Article 20 of the Constitution, which says a person can be punished only under the law existing on the day of the crime.

State government counsel Hemantika Wahi justified the booking of the accused under Pota, saying that certain facts necessitated the action.

The Gujarat government has now moved the apex court, challenging a Gujarat High Court order of July 7, granting bail to the accused. The high court had suspended its order for four weeks in view of the state government''s plea that it would be challenged before the Supreme Court.

Though nobody was injured in the episode a large number of police mobile vans rushed to the spot after the incident was reported to the police control room resulting in rumour-mongering and some tension at the Shivkunj Society in Naranpura, where the home minister stays.

The incident took place when a cow ventured into the premises of Shivkunj Society. The police personnel posted at the premises, staying in a tent erected to house them, for security to the minister of state for home rushed out to drive away the ""nuisance"".

17,Airport drivers plan protest against AAI,"MANGALORE: The Airport Tourist and taxi Drivers'' Association, Bajpe here is planning to launch a protest against the Airports Authority of India''s (AAI) move to call tender for the pre-paid taxi services at the Bajpe airport here.

A press release from association secretary stated that AAI director Vasudev was putting commercial considerations ahead, instead of rendering justice to the people displaced by the airport project --who were now earning their livelihood by operating taxi services.

The press note stated that the director had conveniently forgotten that the AAI may get more revenue through tenders, but this would lead to increase of pre-paid taxi fares, which would burden many.

The pre-paid counter at the airport, presently works on the basis of fares fixed by the authority and pays the requisite fee for using the premises. The release stated if it was given through tender, the bidder would have the sole right to fix the fares according to his wishes.

The association members stated that though they had lost lands for the project, they had not demanded employment, but had found a means for gainful employment by operating the service. The present move would render many unemployed and warned of severe consequences if the move was not aborted.

18,Bharatiya Kisan Sangh rally a flop,"GANDHINAGAR: The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) rally in the state Capital on Monday against the 2.5 times power hike for unmetered electricity for the farmers was a major flop. As against the pre-rally claim that nearly 5,000 farmers might participate, merely 450, brought on 50-odd vehicles, turned up to attend the rally sponsored by the Sangh Parivar''s farmers'' wing. ""They organised the rally so that they aren''t left behind, when the Congress is so active against the hike"", explained a participant.

Addressing the rally, BKS state general secretary Maganlal Patel announced that a ""Maha-Kumbh"" of state kisans would be organised on August 25 in Gandhinagar, where nearly 10 lakh farmers would take a pledge to fight against the hike. Even as the rally was on, the farmers were found losing interest in the rally and walking out, with several of them saying that those addressing them had ""betrayed the farmers'' cause.""

Started an hour after it was scheduled, at 2.00 pm, the senior BKS leader explained the poor attendance in the rally saying most farmers were ""still not angry with the hike."" He said, the heat of the farmers would begin showing once the deadline for paying the bills with hiked tariffs ends on August 20. ""Thereafter, the electricity connections would begin being cut. And there are bound to be scuffles. We plan to catch on that.""

Patel said, he knew that the government was under pressure, but till the farmers showed ""enough strength"" it would not relent. ""Between August 16 and 25 we will go to each MLA and MP to get a written assurance that they stood with us against the hike"", the farmer leader added. ""After all, we are the main voters that have sent them to the assembly or Parliament. Unless we give programmes continuously, things would not change.""

Of the seven leaders who spoke, just Nathubhai Chaudhary, who represented the Gandhinagar district, attacked chief minister Narendra Modi by name saying the CM was merely ""playing with us, misguiding farmers sitting in his airconditioned chamber"". He added, ""Modi''s theatrics will not help. We expect concrete results. The hike was effected without taking farmers into confidence. There are impotent persons who supported the government.""

After the rally, the Gandhinagar district farmer leaders of the BKS were sent to submit a memorandum to the collector. Addressed to the CM, the memorandum said there should be ""no hike in power rates till the Narmada waters were made available to north Gujarat regions."" Apart from opposing the hike and metering of the farm sector, the memorandum also disagreed with the 10 times increase in the fees for artificial insemination, from Rs 10 to Rs 100.

State BKS president Prafull Senjalia, general secretary Maganlal Patel, others, did not accompany the district leaders for handing over the memorandum. A BKS spokesperson explained this was because it was a district-level rally. ""Such rallies have been held in every district, with similar memorandums being submitted to the collectors everywhere.""

19,Jalandhar police tries to cap violence in ranks,"JALANDHAR: The increasing number of incidents, some of them reported while others unreported, in which policemen on duty have lost their temper and indulged in uncontrolled violence has generated a debate among social psychologists and forced the police to do some serious re-thinking about the bottled-up tension among the force and look for remedial measures to handle this tension effectively.

While the police training is being supplemented with yoga and meditation, social psychologists suggest that more drastic remedial measures are required to control the growing tension in the force. Among the incidents cited are the one at Patiala in which a boy selling tea was killed and two policemen mercilessly beat up an autorickshaw driver near the bus stand in Jalandhar.

Pawan Uppal, superintendent of police (training) with Punjab Armed Police, says that ""one of the prime reasons we have identified of rising tension among police staff is that policemen remain posted away from home for long periods. And their jobs are such that they have to do duty for long stretches of time without any relief. We have started laughing sessions at the PAP complex for all ranks of police personnel. After laughter sessions, there is some yoga and then meditation. The phenomenon is being witnessed in all walks of life but is manifesting more violently among policemen.""

S K Nanda, teacher of social psychology and retired principal, Government College of Education, Jalandhar, is of the view that laughing classes alone would not be enough to solve the problem. ""Something would have to be done to make the police force people-friendly. When a situation goes out of hand, it leads to tension, which in turn ends up in violence.""

Most often, Nanda says, policemen are not able to handle situations. ""So they invariably lose temper. Sharing and catharsis are important in releasing tension. Tension is otherwise positive energy which moves society. But when it has no channel for release it leads to violence.""

20,Infosys plans Rs 250-cr investment in Pune,"PUNE: In one of the largest investments in the infotech sector in Pune, IT major Infosys Technologies has announced fresh investments of Rs 250 crore and recruitment of nearly 5,000 professionals over the next few years at its new Pune facility.

This announcement was made by N R Narayana Murthy, chairman and chief mentor, Infosys while taking possession of 44.5 hectares of land at the Pune Infotech Park, Hinjewadi Phase-II.

Significantly, the entire top phalynx of Infosys comprising of Narayana Murthy, company chief executive officer Nandan Nilekani and chief financial officer T V Mohandas Pai among others were present at a small ceremony organised by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) to hand over the land. The company seniors were in Pune for an analystsâ€™ meet at the existing Infosys facility at Hinjewadi Phase-I.

Presenting a picture of buoyancy and optimism, the Infosys top brass said that the company has planned capital expenditure of over Rs 400 crore this year.

â€œOur budget for capital expenditure this year is the range of $80-90 million (over Rs 400 crore) and we plan to add five lakh square feet and 5,000 seats to our existing capacities,â€� the companyâ€™s chief financial officer T V Mohandas Pai said on Monday.

He said that the company was spread out in nine centres over 3.6 million square feet of space and had 18,800 employees.

Infosys is the first company to take possession of land in the second phase of the highly successful Pune IT park developed by the MIDC. State industry secretary Vishwas Dhumal told reporters that the prominent IT firm, Wipro has also booked 17 hectares of land in 188 hectares of Hinjewadi Phase-II.

Interestingly, Infosys was the first IT company to take possession of 10 hectares of land in Hinjewadi Phase-I in 1995, paving the way for other IT companies to follow. The existing IT facility in Pune employs 2,200 persons and undertakes software development work for the US health insurance major Etna and worldwide courier firm DHL. Nearly 400 employees at Infosys, Hinjewadi are dedicated to the Infosys business processing outsourcing (BPO) arm, Progeon.

â€œWe have put in Rs 135 crore in our existing facility at Hinjewadi and we did exports of Rs 380 crore last year,â€� Nilekani said while speaking to journalists at the ceremony.

Narayana Murthy said that the 2,200 employees with Infosys at the IT park was more than double the number of the second largest group in the IT park. He said that both Infosys and Progeon â€œare growing rapidlyâ€�.

Narayana Murthy and other Infosyians were full of praise for the MIDC officials, who they said had displayed â€œdynamismâ€� in developing the Infotech Park. â€œWhatever we required, whether it was water, electricity or roads was delivered ahead of schedule,â€� Narayana Murthy said.

â€œI am very delighted to work with MIDC; we have got extraordinary support from the government of Maharashtra,â€� Nilekani said. â€œThey are the kind of officers who will make Maharashtra proud,â€� Narayana Murthy said while heaping praise on MIDC officials for the development of the IT park.

He said that as had happened in Phase-I, Infosys was likely to act as a â€œcatalystâ€� in the development of Hinjewadi Phase-II. â€œIn the next few years I see exports of nearly Rs 5,000 crore coming out of the IT park itself,â€� he said.

21,No assembly polls in UP with LS: Katiyar,"LUCKNOW: The BJP state president Vinay Katiyar on Monday ruled out possibility of Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh alongwith Lok Sabha polls.

Although Katiyar supported party Central leadership''s stand on holding state and parliamentary elections together but he clarified that it was for states going to polls by this year end. ""The coalition government is going strong in Uttar Pradesh and would complete its full term. Where is the question of holding elections?"" quipped Katiyar.

Soon after the party Central leadership supported the idea, speculations were rife in the State that assembly polls might also be held in Uttar Pradesh alongwith Lok Sabha in view of strained relations between the two ruling coalition partners.

But before the rumours could go into the minds of the party workers, Katiyar quickly put rest to speculations.

Significantly, the BJP state president did not rule out possibility of party asking for the post of deputy chief minister. ""In the given circumstances the party would take whatever steps are needed to strengthen the coalition,"" he said without mentioning the rebel legislators'' demand.

The party state chief said that talks for seat adjustment in Lok Sabha polls would be held after the budget session. ""We have not made up our mind and a decision would be taken only after consulting the coalition partner and central leadership. One thing is sure that the party will have major share from the UP cake,"" he said adding that talks for seat adjustment for local bodies elections would also be held shortly.

Katiyar, however, denied having issued a statement that two-child norm would be enforced in nomination of party office-bearers. ""There is a need for bringing a legislation and framing laws to enforce its implementation not only by all parties but in government jobs and other areas,"" he said.

He also denied media reeports that BJP ministers were ever asked to hold darbars in the party headquarters to attend to workers'' grievances. ""We had introduced a system of making ministers incharge of districts. They were required to go visit district once in a month to attend workers'' grievances. They were never asked to sit in the party headquarters,"" he clarified.

23,Sangh not for early LS elections,"NEW DELHI: Despite Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s pronouncements on simultaneous polls to Lok Sabha and Assemblies, Sangh Parivar leaders feel that general elections would not be held in November. And that the earliest dates could be in February.

Also a section of the Parivar holds that the BJP should fight the coming Lok Sabha polls on its own agenda. The RSS sarsanghachalak K S Sudarshan had earlier asserted that when each NDA constituent has its own agenda the BJP should also pursue its own.

The Parivar elders believe that the Sangh cadre would be enthused and on their feet during elections if the BJP is fighting on its own manifesto that would have all the three contentious issues: Ayodhya, uniform civil code and article 370. It remains to be seen how far the BJP would oblige the Parivar.

Their calculation is that this way the core constituency of the Parivar would remain untouched by the pressure and compromise of alliance politics. And after the polls the BJP could still cobble together an alliance to come back to power.

According to senior RSS leaders the earliest that the elections could be held is February 2004. Apart from the Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh''s opinion against joint polls, the Sangh has other considerations too.

""Advani might have raised the issue to wake up the cadre and gear up the election machinery. But we don''t think they are ready for polls within three months. We don''t campaign for them but only render logistical support but there haven''t been any serious discussions on this yet'' said a Parivar leader.

Also, the leaders feel that the grand strategy for Lok Sabha polls could be worked out only after seeing the performance of the party in the four states that go for Assembly polls in November. For instance, certain leaders in the Vishwa Hindu Parishad thought that bringing in a legislation on Ayodhya and to dissolve Parliament on that issue would be ideal for the BJP.

But these issues have not been thrashed out yet. And the debate on whether to go for polls at all if the BJP does not win three out of the four Congress-ruled states is still not settled. The Sangh leaders have not met since the national executive meeting on July 1 and is not expected to do so till the diwali baithak in October.

24,Govt to introduce Bills with an eye on polls,"NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet took a series of decisions on Monday with an eye on the Assembly elections scheduled for later this year: These included approval for the introduction of Bills in the current session of Parliament to give Delhi full statehood and ban cow slaughter as well as the decision to appoint a Group of Ministers to examine the feasibility of giving reservation to the economically backward among the upper castes.

Sources said that in all likelihood, the Delhi Bill will be referred to a standing committee of Parliament, with the Congress raising several objections to the Bill in its current form.

Similarly, the Bill on cow slaughter which is to cover all states barring Jammu and Kashmir is unlikely to get passed has been brought in, sources said, so that the BJP-led government can derive some political mileage out of it in Madhya Pradesh, where Chief Minister Digvijay Singh had challenged the BJP to pass Central legislation on the subject.

As for the GoM to examine the proposal for reservation of jobs for the economically backward among the upper castes following the Prime Minister''s announcement in Jaipur on Sunday that the Centre was ready to introduce a Bill in Parliament if the move was supported by the Opposition appears to be a political move to counter Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot''s challenge to the Centre on the subject.

With the GoM having just been set up, it appears unlikely that the Bill can be introduced in this session. Sources added that the GoM head Deputy PM L K Advani will meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi next week to discuss the matter with her.

Briefing the press, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said that once the Bill to ban cow slaughter is passed by the Parliament, it will be binding on all states under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, and make beef export illegal.

The Bill will be brought under Entry 17 of the Concurrent List which provides for Prevention of Cruelty against Animals; till now, it was under Entry 15 of the State List which provided for preservation of animals and states were free to enact legislation in this regard under Article 252 (1) of the Constitution.

The other decisions taken on Monday related to:

* approval to amendments to incorporate provisions in the Industrial Development Bank of India ( Transfer of Undertakings and Repeal) Bill introduced in the Winter Session of 2002 to ensure that the new banking company also continues to be a development bank, to provide term lending to large, medium and small industry.

The amendments were suggested by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, which submitted its report July end, and Finance Minister Jaswant Singh wants the Bill to be brought in the current session of Parliament.

Swaraj said that as ""the operations of IDBI had come under strain, the Reserve Bank came out with a policy in April 2001 to transform the DFI by evolving a cautious transition path to become a bank.""

The standing committee, to which it was referred suggested that IDBI should retain its DFI role even after the conversion, and that the government should retain a 51 per cent stake in IDBI, offer income tax and capital gains tax exemptions and come up with a VRS package.

* approval to a Rs 324.66 crore rail project to link all Buddhist pilgrim centres and promote tourism, to be implemented in eight years. To bridge the missing link, a 32.5 km rail route between Hajipur and Sagauli (via Vaishali) will be constructed in the next five years, while the whole 148 km stretch would be completed in eight years.

* approval to amend the Criminal Procedure Code to prevent witnesses from turning hostile among other things the Bill would provide for punishment for witnesses who turn hostile, make it compulsory for all statements by witnesses recorded in front of a magistrate instead of police as of now.

25,"Agriculture, investment key issues in WTO: Cong","NEW DELHI: A national consensus seems to be building up on the key issues of concern for India at the WTO meeting of trade ministers in Cancun to be held on September 10-14.

The Congress on Monday agreed with the government that the WTO negotiations in liberalisation of the world trade in agriculture and the attempt of some of the developed countries to start negotiations on a global investment agreement are two of the special areas of India''s concern at the forthcoming WTO conference.

As part of his effort to evolve a national consensus on WTO issues, Commerce and Industry Minister Arun Jaitaly met Congress leaders Pranab Mukherjee and Manmohan Singh here and discussed the present state of play at the WTO negotiations.

He sought their views and support in evolving a strategy for the WTO talks so that India''s interests in key area of agriculture, industrial tariff and the so called Singapore issues are fully safeguarded.

The four Singapore issues are proposals made by some of the developed countries, notably the European Union, to negotiation global agreements under the WTO covering areas such as foreign investment, competition policy, trade facilitation and government procurement. India is opposed to expanding the WTO agenda to include such negotiations. It is of the opinion that particularly in an area such as foreign investment, national governments must retain the policy space to decide on entry of foreign capital.

Even though the Congress leaders agreed with Jaitley on the key issues of India''s concern, they also wanted the minister to keep them informed on the developing situation so that they could provide specific suggestions on any particular issue that comes up during WTO talks.

26,SBS violence: Witnesses asked to record statements,"CHANDIGARH: UT Deputy Commissioner-cum-District Magistrate Arun Kumar has asked residents of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Colony who were witness to eruption of violence at the colony in June to get their statements recorded at the estate office.

27,Three Cong MLAs quit party,"HYDERABAD: Mounting further pressure on the party high command to support Telangana state issue, three more legislators offered resignation letters to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday, taking the total MLAs submitted their papers so far to seven.

The MLAs are unhappy at the party leadership for not backing up the cause of separate statehood for Telangana.

Congress Forum for Telangana (CFT) president and MLA G Chinna Reddy told reporters that the four MLAs -- U Purushottam Reddy, Gurnath Reddy, and P Veeraiah have submitted their letters of resignation to Sonia Gandhi and asked her to forward it to the Assembly Speaker, if she is not favouring Telangana cause.

Though Chinna Reddy claimed at the press conference that Kollapur MLA J Krishna Rao also submitted his papers, Rao later said that he had not given consent to the CFT president to announce his resignation to the media. ""I am for Telangana, but it is unfair for the CFT leaders to announce my resignation without taking my consent,"" he told The Times of India from Kollapur.

The Telangana Congress Legislators Forum (TCLF) A Indrakaran Reddy, who along with Chinna Reddy, P Purushottam Reddy and B Saraiah submitted resignations to Sonia on Saturday, said a meeting of all Congress MLAs from Telangana has been called on August 17 to discuss the latest developments. He said an invitation will also be sent to newly appointed PCC president and Nizamabad MLA D Srinivas and it is left to him to attend the meeting.

The CFT president said they would withdraw the resignations only when the party forms either a separate Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee or pass a resolution in AICC or CWC endorsing its commitment to Telangana state.

Chinna Reddy said political secretary to Sonia Gandhi, Ahmed Patel, was in touch with him, adding that the forum would not budge until the party concedes to any of one their demands.

He also said that the MLAs will be touring Telangana districts to take up the cause further and the CFT is overwhelmed with the response from the people. He said a majority of the Congress MLAs from the region have endorsed the need to take up serious steps for the cause of separate statehood and were in touch with the forum.

Asked whether Y S Rajasekhara Reddy had been asked to mediate the issue, Chinna Reddy said YSR would be welcomed, if he can settle the problem. Rajasekhara Reddy, however, denied the reports that he had been told by the high command to mediate.

29,School teachers to protest state policies,"KOLKATA: Hundreds of teachers belonging to the Secondary Teachers and Employees Association will squat on Rani Rashmoni Road for 24 hours starting at 2 pm on August 13, protesting against the ""anti-education"" policies of both the Centre and the state governments.

This was said at a press conference called by STEA on Monday.

""The state government has increased tuition fees in both general and engineering colleges manifold. Add to this the private engineering colleges that can fix their tuition fees randomly. It is now clear that the state government intends education to be reserved only for the rich,"" criticised STEA general secretary Ratan Laskar.

Among the demands to be put forward on the day, is 1:40 teacher-student ratio that was recommended by the Kothari Commission. ""The state government accepts 1:80 as the ideal ratio, which is unacceptable to us.

The state government has been wanting to put a ban on private tuitions which will be possible only if this 1:40 ratio is followed,"" Laskar said.

30,"BJP takes PM's cue, spikes plan for early polls","NEW DELHI: The proposal, mooted by a section of the BJP leadership, to advance the Lok Sabha polls to November this year and hold them simultaneously with assembly elections in five states, has been scotched.

At Sunday''s Jaipur rally, the Prime Minister referred to general elections being held after ""a year-and-a half"". Later, the BJP ""postponed"" a scheduled meeting of party MPs in Jaipur on August 23/24, which was to be attended by the PM and deputy PM LK Advani, to consider the dates of the next general elections.

BJP office-bearers, who met at party president Venkaiah Naidu''s residence on Monday, taking their cue from the PM, ruled out a November LS poll.

The idea of synchronising the assembly elections scheduled for November in MP, Rajasthan, Delhi, Chhatisgarh and Mizoram with an early general election, party sources said, came from Rajya Sabha chairperson B S Shekhawat, partly because he felt this would help the outcome in Rajasthan.

This was then publicly articulated by Advani, who said synchronising general and assembly elections would save money and ""facilitate development"".

The BJP, fearing poor results in the assembly elections, which could adversely affect the general elections, felt it would be more prudent to hold them together.

The thinking was that as the next LS poll is being built up as a Vajpayee versus Sonia encounter, it could help the BJP vis-a-vis the Congress in the four major states if the elections were clubbed together.

31,Front flays Antony govt's stand on Marad,"KOZHIKODE: Muslim outfit, National Development Front (NDF), on Monday urged Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony to withdraw his recent anti-minorities remarks immediately and also asked the government to speed up rehabilitation at nearby Marad where nine persons were killed in violence on May 2.

The NDF Supreme Council, which met at Manjeri in neighbouring Malappuram district, said the charge that the minorities in the State were using their organised force to reap more benefits from the government was ''baseless'' and asked Antony to withdraw his ''controversial'' statement immediately.

Expressing concern over the fate of several hundred families of minority community, which fled Marad following the violent incident and now languishing in various refugee camps, the Front urged the government to speed up the process of rehabilitation to enable the deserted families to return to their homes in the beach area.

Accusing the government of ''commercialising'' the educational policy, the Council said as a result of it, economically-backward classes were denied the opportunity to pursue professional education in the State in view of the existing exorbitant fees.

NDF also wanted Coca Cola companies operating in Kerala to be closed down soon as it posed ''serious health hazards.''

Demanding implementation of special recruitment as recommended by the Narendra Commission, the Front said it would take out protest marches to the residences of ministers in Thiruvananthapuram on August 27 in support of the demand, a release issued by its general secretary, Nasiruddin Elamaram here said.

32,Kerala govt to form dam safety authority,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala government is to constitute a dam safety authority for conservation of water by protecting dams, State minister for water resources T M Jacob told the assembly on Monday.

Replying to the debate on the Kerala irrigation and water conservation bill presented in the house, Jacob said the opinion of expert Supreme Court advocates had been sought before drafting the bill.

One of the provisions in the bill stipulated that a resolution should be adopted by the assembly before the State enters into any agreement with other States on the use of its water resources.

He said the bill aimed at consolidating several old acts on dams, which were still in force in the state. On the safety of Mullapperiyar dam, he said though the agency deputed by the Central Water Commission had certified that it was safe, the state had concern over its safety.

A team of experts assigned by the state government had found that it was not safe, he said.
