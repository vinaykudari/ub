0,Govt mulling disinvestment,"lucknow: in a bid to uplift the state's economy, the government has recently proposed to wind up three corporations, lay off state's three per cent work force and initiate a number of other steps in coming months. the state at present has 28 lakh employees, including the teachers. according to official information, the three corporations to be wound up are uttar pradesh state mineral development corporation, uttar pradesh poultry and livestock limited and uttar pradesh instrumental limited. the decision to disband these corporations was taken following reports submitted by the disinvestment commission. the commission, which had examined the viability of 19 corporations, has already submitted reports about 13 others, which are being examined by the bureau of public enterprises. the government has drawn up a list of 15,000 employees under its downsizing scheme. nearly 11,000 of them have been offered voluntary retirement scheme (vrs). a finance department official confirmed that 7,000 employees had already accepted the vrs offer. an official said that the government's concern stemmed from the fact that the per capita income, which was only three per cent lower than the national average in 1950-51, had gone down by 38 per cent as compared to the national average. the state's credit-deposit ratio stood at 27.1 per cent against the national average of 57.1 per cent. moreover, loans and advances extended by the all india financial institutions like idbi and icici remained far from satisfactory. in 1998-99, uttar pradesh's share of the loans disbursed by these institutions was only six per cent, which was too meagre considering the fact that the state had 16 per cent of country's population. the over-dependence on agriculture too is one of the main reasons behind the stagnant economy. consider this: nearly 73 per cent of state's total work-force earns its livelihood from agriculture, but the share of state's revenue from the sector is just 36 per cent. thus, 64 per cent of the state's revenue is coming from only 27 per cent non-agricultural workers. during last two decades, the annual growth rate of income through agriculture has remained static at around 2.5 per cent. so, till the employment opportunities are not generated in other sectors, it would be difficult to uplift the state's economy, said an official.

4,Bihar govt lukewarm to crackdown on SIMI,"patna: the rabri devi government has apparently gone slow with regard to the crackdown on student islamic movement of india (simi) activists, even as the centre banned the activities of this organisation on thursday. home commissioner u n panjiyar said the fax message from the union home ministry on banning of the controversial outfit was received on friday. ""the notification will be issued today. only after issuance of the notification, arrests of simi activists will take place,"" he remarked. ironically, simi office-bearers have certified that the bihar government was ""very cooperative"" and also appreciated the work of the outfit. incidentally, ban on the simi by the union government on thursday witnessed instant crackdown on simi offices and activists even in the non-bjp ruled states like madhya pradesh, maharashtra and west bengal on the same day. however, the bihar government, on thursday evening, had maintained that it had not received any official communication on the ban order from the centre. ""we are aware of it only through media reports,"" remarked panjiyar. the state simi president, abrar arif, however, issued statements on thursday evening against the ban imposed by the centre late thursday night. meanwhile, rjd chief laloo prasad yadav questioned the decision of the union government of ""singling out simi for the ban"". speaking to the times of india on friday, he said, ""every terrorist outfit which plays with religious sentiments should be banned at one go."" he stressed that organisations like vishwa hindu parihsad, bajrang dal and rss should be banned because they had a track record of playing with religious sentiments. he alleged that the bjp-led government at thre centre, by singling out simi, wanted to create a communal tension for political gains. laloo emphasised that before arriving at the decision, all political parties should have been taken into confidence. ""what is the use of banning outfits. in bihar, we had imposed bans on the activities of a private army like ranvir sena and left extremists mcc and pwg. indiraji had banned the rss. nothing happened. instead of banning these outfits, we should attack reasons why these outfits flourish and are able to strenthen themselves,"" he stated, insisting that his government would look into constitutional provisions to ban outfits like bajrang dal and vhp in bihar. politicial observers, however, insist that the ruling rjd, which has promoted the ""muslim-yadav"" combination in the state, did not want to be seen acting hastily. ""simi's influence in bihar is marginal. it has less than 100 students as its members,"" said congress state vice-president shakeeluzaman. however, less than 10 days ago, the simi had organised a meeting in patna in the presence of its president in which provocative slogans against the usa and in favour of the world's most-wanted terrorist osama bin laden were raised.

16,Twelve companies evince interest in buying NJMC,"new delhi: twelve companies have so far evinced interest in buying the loss-making national jute manufacturers corporation, bids for which will close on october 3. ""the response to the invitation of bids by the operating agency iibi for njmc has been good with 12 private companies showing interest. more could join the fray before closing of the bid on october 3,"" official sources said here. sources declined to name any of the companies, which had bid for njmc, but said some of them were leading jute-manufacturing companies. the good response has increased chances for the privatisation of njmc by december 2001 since neither the workers cooperatives nor the state governments had shown any interest in buying the public sector undertaking, they said. njmc has six mills, five of which are in west bengal and one in bihar. the board for industrial and financial reconstruction (bifr) had directed industrial investment bank of india to propose sale of njmc first to the workers cooperatives followed by the state governments and then the private sector. government has been providing a budgetary support of around rs 96 crore per year to meet the shortfall in the company's salary and wages. operational losses of the company have increased to nearly rs 100 crore annually, sources added. sources said that privatisation of the njmc was not likely to meet with stiff opposition from the trade unions as there were sufficient guarantees for the 12,000 odd permanent workers of the psu. ""it is envisaged that the mills will be handed over to the buyers with the condition that they will continue to run these mills at least for 10 years with a view to safeguard the interests of permanent workers,"" they said. permanent workers will not be sacked until vrs, sources said, adding that once the bids were closed the operating agency, iibi would prepare a draft rehabilitation scheme (drs), which would then be submitted, to the bifr. the drs would identify the liabilities, which would be taken over by the government, they said. the government has agreed to provide budgetary support for any shortfall in payment of statutory dues, as and when the revival plan is finalised, sources said, adding that the pending dues of secured creditors of about rs 10 crore would be met from the sale value of the mills. the centre would also provide funds for salary and wages of workers till december 31, they added. the bifr, in its hearing in february this year, had concluded that the njmc was not likely to make its net worth positive within a reasonable time, while meeting all its financial obligations. bifr, therefore, directed that a show-cause notice be issued to the company for winding up the corporation. in response, the textiles ministry submitted a proposal to sell the six units, which was approved by the bifr.

17,OVL clinches $100 m deal with 5 Indian banks,"new delhi: ongc-videsh said today it has clinched a $100 million credit from five indian banks to part finance its share in the $508 million gas joint venture in vietnam. ""we signed the loan agreement with the banks on friday. this is perhaps for the first time an indian company has got a loan from indian banks in foreign exchange for investment abroad,"" ovl director, finance, n c pany, told pti. as per the agreement, the overseas arm of ongc would get the nine-year credit from bank of india, state bank of travancore, punjab national bank, indian overseas bank and state bank of patiala from their foreign currency non-resident account. after three years, the dollar loan, availed at 45-50 basis points above libor (london inter bank offer rates), would be converted into rupee account, pany said, adding sbi-caps had arranged the credit for the corporation. with 45 per cent equity in the vietnam venture, which after commissioning would take care of 60 per cent of the country's demand for the electricity sector, ovl's share comes to $228 million. pany explained that against this, ovl was required to mobilise only $155 million as the remaining amount would be generated from its share in the venture after the development of first phase in 2002. pany said the parent company ongc had given $46 million as equity money for the vietnam project last year and now ovl needed to mobilise only about $9 million to complete the transaction. dubbing the vietnam project as a ""saviour"" for ovl, which has lost about rs 89 crore in three ventures abroad, pany said cash generated from the project would be rechannelised in other ventures for expansion and acquisition of more oil and gas equity. claiming that ovl's oil and gas reserves would surpass that of the parent company ongc by 2006, pany said his company was projecting a profit of $2500 million in 2007-08. though actual cash flow in the company would start from 2002-03 onwards after the commercial production of gas at the vietnam venture, ovl would start thriving only after commissioning of sakhalin oil project in russia where the indian entity has acquired 20 per cent equity, pany said. ovl has also financed another 20 per cent equity on behalf of roseneft, parent company of the sakhalin project, which is expected to start commercial production of oil from 2005.

18,`Govt insincere to rehabilitating displaced people,"patna: not only those who champion the cause of displaced people but also a committee of the legislative council constituted to look into the problem of rehabilitation of displaced people is dissatisfied with the way the government has handled it. this is evident in the very first report of the rehabilitation committee of the council tabled in the house on september 28. it has expressed its serious concern over the state government's abject failure in rehabilitating displaced persons, majority of whom come from economically weaker sections of the society. the report has taken into account displacement of people of hazi chand ki maszid, chand colony, gaighat of patna city and mahmudichak rajendra nagar of patna due to the anti-encroachment drive. it has also incorporated the plight of people displaced in the wake of anti-encroachment drive in the vaishali district. these apart, displacement of people due to erosion caused by the ganga in the buxar district as well as by the gandak and kosi rivers in other districts and by different development schemes in the state has been taken note of. the house committee has also taken into account displacement of people caused by flood and natural disaster. incidentally, the cases taken into account in the report were raised in the house by its members. the committee felt that the anti-encroachment drive was launched from time to time in patna in pursuance of the patna high court order, but the high court order never meant that the poor people settled in different localities of the town be thrown out. the high court, in fact, had only ordered the removal of encroachments on various roads, the report has noted, adding what really happened was that the government authorities virtually removed the poor people from their habitations in various localities. the issue of the removal of khatals (sheds made in the town by milkmen to rear milch cattle) has also been discussed in the report. these khatals were removed in the course of anti-encroachment drive conducted by the administration in different parts of patna. while the urban development department authorities had suggested that these displaced milkmen be settled in the rajendra ghat and digha localities, those displaced from the khatals in the city still await their rehabilitation, the report has stated. incidentally, a drive for the removal of khatals was also conducted in neighbouring west bengal towns, but they were given alternative places to settle on the outskirts of various towns and cities, the report has recalled. as a matter of fact, the bihar urban development department secretary had been asked to send an officer to west bengal to study the rehabilitation of the displaced milkmen done there. whether it was really complied with the rehabilitation committee has no information, the report has stated. the committe report has also noted that the rehabilitation act had become obsolete and needed amendment to address to the problem of displacement and rehabilitation in the present time.

20,KPTC inefficiency: People complain to minister,"raichur: they listen to your telephonic complaint, but don't bother to respond. at times, they hang up. worse, they leave the phone off the hook. they are prompt in disconnecting power at the slightest movement of the wind, they are also prompt with the bills. they are very conscientious about power cuts, except in areas where vips and officials reside. the image of the karnataka power transmission corporation staffer, from lineman and executive engineer, received a beating when the issue was taken up before energy minister veerakumar patil here recently. reporters and the public complained to patil that the average kptc staffer chronically evaded responsibility, and did not discharge their duties. they alleged that the executive engineer and chief engineer of kptc, gulbarga division, were not ready to reform despite pleas from the public. the officials are well-settled and the only remedy is to transfer the officials and bring in responsible ones, they said. top officials and leaders have no problem with power supply, come wind or rain. they know how to get the engineers and linemen to fall in line, it is the common man who suffers, the minister was told. for a week now, the only response a raichur citizen gets from the kptc is: ""line kharab hai, mujhe malum nahin, saab ko puchcho (the line is bad, i don't know, please ask the officer)"".

22,Students fume at govt `no' to late exam fee,"bangalore: the karnataka state secondary education board's decision not to allow late payment of sslc exam fees has been seen as a ""very harsh step against students."" unlike previous years, the board this year decided not to allow late payment of fees to avoid any confusion that would arise later. last year's chaos in the declaration of sslc results had been attributed to problems over late submission of applications. the board had fixed october 3 as the last date for payment of exam fees. students, parents and school managements feel this move would have largescale implications as it would specially affect private candidates and candidates from rural areas. ""if for some reason we fail to pay the exam fee, we will lose one chance. though there is a provision to take up the supplementary exam in july, we will unnecessarily miss an opportunity to write sit for the exam in march,"" regrets ravi, who is appearing for the exam as a private candidate. the karnataka association of unaided english school managements has raised the issue with the state government. k.s. krishna iyer, association general secretary, met t.m. vijayabhaskar, commissioner of public instruction, last week to request him to reconsider the decision. ""the commissioner said he would look into the matter. the main issue is that students would miss out on one opportunity and they are mostly voiceless who come from rural areas,"" he later told this paper. the board charges rs 120 for regular students sitting for the exam for the first time, rs 40 to rs 120 for repeaters and rs 308 from private candidates. this year, the government decided to exempt girl students of government high schools from paying exam fees. out of the nearly 800,000 students who appear for the sslc exam annually, only about 300,000 are regular candidates. the rest are repeaters and private candidates. ""considering their huge number, the board should reconsider its decision,"" iyer felt.

23,"11,000 Muslims have died in J&K violence","srinagar: pakistan-sponsored militancy has taken a toll of more than 29,160 lives in jammu and kashmir during the last 12 years. of the 12,400 civilians killed during this period, 11,000 alone were muslims. in addition, as many as 21,746 civilians and personnel of the security forces were injured, according to an official spokesman. hence, the so-called jehad, has actually harmed the muslim population more than any other community. the fact that 11,000 muslims were killed shows hat the muslim population is resisting pakistan's designs and increasingly becoming victim of the militants' thirst for blood, notwithstanding pakistan's orchestrated propaganda. those killed in the violence during the last 12 years comprised 12,406 civilians killed by militants, 3,140 security force personnel and 13,609 militants. of the militants killed, nearly 2,150 were foreign mercenaries, mostly pakistanis and some afghans. the militants even did not spare children and women. during the first fortnight of this month, at least 16 children were killed. overall, about 600 women and 110 children have been killed during the 12 years of militancy. giving details of the colossal damage caused by cross-border terrorism in the state, an official spokesman said that foreign mercenaries dominated militant outfits, continued with their killing spree even when the entire world, including pakistan, which has sponsored militancy in j&k, had woken upto the danger of terrorism and joined hands to root it out. he said this year, 2,400 persons had lost their lives in terrorist violence. the spokesman said pro-pakistan militants had caused as many as 50,000 violent incidents in the state during the last 12 years. these included hurling of grenades, planting of improvised explosive devices (ieds) on roads, arson, firing, abduction and attacks on the security forces. the involvement of pakistan was evident from the huge weaponry and ammunition recovered from militants during this period. the arsenal included about 35,000 weapons, 56,000 magazines, 34 lakh ammunition rounds, 47,500 grenades and ieds, 5,500 kg of rdx and more than 50,000 detonators besides other weapons.

24,The government owes the UAS an apology,"bangalore:it's called consensus. it's about being aware of citizens' emotions and respecting their collective thought. if only the karnataka government had sought the views of the students and faculty of the university of agricultural sciences, before sending in the bulldozers, there wouldn't have been so much violence. and the proposed bio-technology park wouldn't have been put on the back-burner. the problem with our babus is they think they must blindly implement the wishes of their political masters. so when somanahalli mallaiah krishna declared that he wanted a biotechnology park to be set up in bangalore, the babus got cracking and selected 100 acre of densely wooded land in the campus of the uas for the proposed park. except that neither the university's governing council nor the board of regents had agreed to the proposal. the board had made clear that it was willing to donate 100 acre of land near the yeshwanthpur-yelahanka road but not in the heart of the campus which the forest department and university officials had turned into a bio-zone during the last five decades. boars, mongooses, hares, foxes, cobras, tree snakes, over 30 bird species and myriad tree species including sandalwood thrive in this urban forest. but babus care two hoots about niceties. so they sent a note to vice-chancellor a.m. krishnappa that they were taking over the land and voila the bulldozers trundled in. all hell broke loose on thursday and bangalore's cops not known for either intelligence or intellectual rigour fell upon protesting students and teachers with their batons and tear gas shells. scores of innocent people were badly beaten and treated worse than cattle being sent for slaughter. it minister b.k. chandrashekar, agriculture minister t.b. jayachandra and it secretary vivek kulkarni owe the citizens, especially students and faculty of the uas an explanation. it's because of the bungling of the government that bio-technology has suffered a grievous blow. the sooner the mess is cleared and the bad times swept away, the better. for in bio-technology will increasingly prove important to bangalore's economic well-being as well as provide a hi-tech edge to the city in the global market place. krishna has time and time again been speaking of consensus especially when it comes to development. even when public opinion was sought as in the case of the proposed bangalore-mysore expressway, it was more symbolic than actual. for the project has been cleared despite numerous protests. elsewhere in the civilized world, public opinion is taken very seriously by bureaucrats and politicians. here it doesn't matter. for the police are ever willing to be stooges to the government.

25,UAS violence: CM takes a shot at students,"bangalore: chief minister s m krishna on sunday launched a veiled attack against instigators of the uas violence over the biotech park issue. ""the prime minister and foreign countries laud the efforts of karnataka in biotechnology, but there are some people who are against it,"" he said, inaugurating the 'sankat haran bima yojana', an insurance scheme for farmers. while agreeing it is habitual to have reservations about a new venture, krishna was, however, critical of the methods adopted to express those reservations. ""what is the necessity of making such an issue out of it? the matter could be discussed and there are lots of opportunities to solve such problems. instead, they have chosen to cheat farmers out of the benefits accrued from advances in biotechnology,"" he maintained. the cm declared ""his government's objective is the farmer's well-being and we are prepared to join hands with anybody who comes forward with this objective in mind.""
