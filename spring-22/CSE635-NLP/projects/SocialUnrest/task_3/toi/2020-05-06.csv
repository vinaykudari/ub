0,Bank staff protest salary cut,"BATHINDA: Thousands of employees of the Punjab state cooperative banks and state cooperative agriculture development banks are on the war path against the reduction in their pay scales.

Under an order of the registrar of the cooperative societies of Punjab, the salaries of the employees has been brought at par with Punjab government employees on April 17.

The government move was aimed at bringing down the cost of management in co-operative banks so that the rate of interest on loans to farmers could be reduced. Bank employees have been wearing black badges for over two weeks and observing a pen down strike for a few hours daily. They say that close to Rs 2,000 would be deducted from their salaries.

The governmentâ€™s decision to cut the cost of management has its origin in the fact that the cooperative sector banks were being unable to meet the objective behind their formation.

The objective had been to provide farmers loans at low rates of interest. But due to higher management costs, the banks were charging higher interest rates on loans to farmers than commercial banks.

This has resulted in lower credit off-take in the co-operative banks during the last six years, sources claimed.

The governmentâ€™s claim was, however, contested by Parampal Singh, president of the employees union. He said that the cooperative banks were providing loans at the interest rate of 10 per cent per annum.

He said it was not the high cost of management but the wrong structure for disbursement of agriculture loans which was responsible for the high rate of interest.

He said that the cost of management in the cooperative banks was 2.5 per cent for 2003 year which was well within the standards fixed by the RBI.

Sources added that the cost of management in the private and commercial banks was around 2 per cent in private and commercial banks.

Counting the reasons for high cost of management in the cooperative banks, Parampal said that the banks were forced to finance ailing units like Punwire, ABSCOSPIN and BACOSPIN.

He said the banks were burdened with the staff on deputation from the cooperative department and unnecessary expenditure of the vehicles and entrainment of the cooperative department officials which otherwise had no contribution in the banksâ€™ functioning.

He said that if the government did not go back on its decision, the employees would go on a complete dayâ€™s strike on May 13.

1,"Chautala playing fodder politics, says Dalal","CHANDIGARH: The Republican Party of India (RPI) on Tuesday alleged that after sugarcane politics in Uttar Pradesh (UP), it was now fodder politics being played by Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala to earn the goodwill of the people of Rajasthan.

Cautioning Rajasthan electorate not to fall in Chautalaâ€™s trap, lone RPI legislator and former minister Karan Singh Dalal said at a press conference here that on the eve of the assembly elections in UP, Chautala had pretended to be the well-wisher of cane-growers of that state, but once the elections were over and the electorate of UP had rejected his partyâ€™s candidates at the hustings, he never bothered to know about their plight , said Dalal adding that he (Chautala) was playing the same game now in Rajasthan by sending trainloads of fodder ostensibly out of sympathy for the drought-hit people of that state.

But the reality was that Chautala had political ambitions in Rajasthan which was scheduled to go to the polls soon, observed Dalal emphasising that it was in pursuit of these ambitions that he had started holding kisan rallies in that state also.

The net outcome of this ""fodder politics"" was that fodder was in short supply in Haryana leading to its prices going up, said Dalal adding that even small farmers were being compelled to part with their fodder stocks so as to enable the chief minister to send fodder to Rajasthan.

Expressing confidence that the Congress was in a position to give a tough fight to Chautalaâ€™s party in Fatehabad assembly byelection, Dalal urged opposition parties to unite to ensure that Chautala was not allowed to resort to Meham-like terror in Fatehabad to win the byelection. Asked if his party would also work for the success of Congress candidate, Dalal said his sole aim was to work for the defeat of Chautalaâ€™s party which was a symbol of corruption and terror.

Claiming that the people of Haryana wanted to get rid of Chautala government at the earliest, Dalal said his information was that the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) had recently sent its team to West Bengal to study the tactics used by CPM there to win elections.

This showed that his intentions were not good as he would like to win the next assembly elections in the state at any cost, observed Dalal urging the people not to be misled by Chautalaâ€™s promises this time. They should, in fact, take a lesson from the fact that Chautala was yet to fulfil the promises made by him on the eve of the last parliamentary elections, Dalal added.

According to police sources, the incident bore its roots in the fact that there existed rivalry between residents of Laxmipura and a colony located outside the village. The seeds for Mondayâ€™s violence were sown on Sunday when youngsters had an fracas at a bus stand in the village.

3,Warrant for arrest of Sharma,"New Delhi: A day after the former Delhi high court judge, Shameet Mukherjee, was granted bail, the special judge at Patiala courts issued production warrant for the sacked Delhi Development Authority (DDA) vice-chairman, Subhash Sharma.

The order was passed after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sought Sharmaâ€™s arrest in the case in which Mukherjee is also an accused.

Sharma was earlier arrested and accused of showing favours to an educational society. He was sent to Tihar jail. On Tuesday, CBIâ€™s advocate T P Singh made a representation before the court of additional sessions judge Prem Kumar.

He said since the CBI has the custody of three accused â€” Mukherjee, alleged master fixer, Dharambir Khattar and personal secretary to former DDA vice-chairman, Ashok Kapoor â€” it was imperative to get the custody of former DDA chairman to unearth the conspiracy. The CBI has alleged that Sharma showed favours to a property dealer and changed the DDAâ€™s lawyer at his instance.

The lawyer had made out a strong case in favour the DDA in the high court and this was going against the interest of the property dealer.

Meanwhile, Sharma has moved a bail application in the high court. Justice R C Chopra has fixed May 16 for the hearing. Sharmaâ€™s bail application will be heard alongwith that of former DDA commissioner (land) Anand Mohan Sharan.

4,Naidu for debate on development,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has favoured a debate on the region-wise development in the state in irrigation, health, education and others sectors.

Replying to a question at a press conference on Tuesday on the demand by the Congress and the TRS for a debate on the issue, Naidu said the government was prepared for a debate. However, he said the Congress had avoided a debate in the budget session of the assembly. Naidu said that opposition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy had admitted that Telangana had seen development, but required more investments for irrigation. He ridiculed YSR for â€œtouring the villages for the first time and talking about development.â€�

The chief minister reiterated that the TDP was committed to the development of backward areas and dismissed any threat to his party from the Telangana Rashtra Samiti politically. He attributed the response to the TRS meetings to â€œvarious other reasonsâ€�. He added that the TDP had a proactive approach and the fate of political parties like the TRS would be decided by the people during elections.

Naidu stated that the TDP had concentrated on the development of backward regions and listed out the schemes implemented in the fields of education, health, employment, power and other sectors. However, he said irrigation required a investment of Rs 50,000 crore and the government would mobilise the resources and complete the Devadula and Kalwakurthy projects.

To a question on imposing ban on distribution of tridents by VHP in Kerala, he said it was not easy to do so. However, in the wake of Marad incident, government would examine the matter, he said.

A Division Bench comprising Justice Vishnu Sahai and Justice Abdul Matin asked the state not to conduct investigations in any of the FIRs or any other case it proposed to file regarding alleged misuse of the discretionary fund during Yadav''s two tenures as the chief minister.

Yadav, who was the chief minister of the state from December 5, 1989 to June 29, 1991 and again from December 4, 1993 to June 3, 1995, filed the petition seeking quashing of the FIRs.

Senior counsel Ram Jethmalani, appearing for Yadav, strongly contended that the FIRs relating to the chief minister''s discretionary fund deserves to be quashed as they have been lodged with malafide intentions at the behest of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati after a long gap of eight years.

Additional Public Prosecutor Jyotendra Mishra and L P Mishra, appearing for Mayawati, contended that the FIRs were in connection with serious offences and the law should take its course.

After hearing both the parties, the court granted eight weeks time to file counter affidavit and four weeks to file rejoinder affidavit. The matter will now be heard on August 19 next.

12,Principal faces negligence case,"New Delhi: The principal of St Mount Carmel School, Dwarka, has been summoned to a city court for violating the Supreme court guidelines by not ensuring that the apex courtâ€™s safety guidelines for school buses.

Metropolitan magistrate Surinder Singh Rathi has said that N M Williams will face charges of causing death due to negligence. He said she should stand trial in the court and has asked her to appear on May 8.

On December 12 last year, two boys Shekhar Gosai and Anmol fell off the bus when the busâ€™s door was flown open, as it took a sharp turn.

While Anmol, a class fourth student, survived, Gosai was killed. The driver, Sukeshwar ran away, but the conductor was apprehended at the spot. The police also managed to trace the bus owner, Gagandeep.

During the investigation, the police learnt that the school-bus did not have a speed governor. The conductor and Gagandeepâ€™s questioning revealed that the appointment of the driver was also in contravention to the Supreme Courtâ€™s order.

â€˜â€˜The driver was not holding an authorisation card which has to be issued by the State Transport Authority,â€™â€™ Rathi observed in his order. The police also learnt the conductor was uneducated and not qualified for the job. â€˜â€˜He was not even holding a qualified conductor licence as required under the Motor Vehicle Act,â€™â€™ the judge said.

According to him, the principal is responsible for the violations because she did not pay heed to a letter of the Director, Transport in which she was reminded of the Supreme Court guidelines. The letter was addressed to Williams on August 7, 2002, five months before the accident.

Rathi said the principal failed to comply to the norms despite the reminder.

He held that the fall-out of the non-compliance of the guidelines has caused â€˜â€˜irreparable damage to the boyâ€™s parents.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Had the principal been diligent in ensuring strict compliance of statutory guidelines, the accident could have been averted and the boyâ€™s life would have been saved,â€™â€™ Rathi held.

The judge said the agreement which Williams entered with the bus-owner has been cleverly worded. â€˜â€˜The principal and the school management give the impression that the entire responsibility of ensuring the strict compliance of the guidelines rests on the

transporter,â€™â€™ he said.

13,Traders protest shift to Narela,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is all set to allot plots in Narela to Lal Kuan chemical traders, but they are not willing to shift.

Of the 883 plots demarcated in the far north locality of Narela, not more than 27 have accepted the allotment letter till now.

â€˜â€˜We cannot shift there because there is no infrastructure to run the market in a totally dislocated and unconnected place on the border of Delhi,â€™â€™ said Suresh Kejriwal, the president of the Chemical Traders Association.

According to him, there is no proper approach road. The road here is so long and tortuous, it will be difficult for heavy vehicles like a 16-wheel trailer to get inside.

â€˜â€˜The price is also prohibitive. Earlier it was settled at Rs 2,750 per square metre. Then DDA suddenly hiked it to Rs 16,200. Now they have brought the price down to Rs 10,800, but most of us still cannot pay,â€™â€™ Kajriwal said.

â€˜â€˜The plots they have cut are 50 square metres each. Why would a trader who has a 1000 square metre plot here move to that cramped place,â€™â€™ he said.

The DDA on the other hand refutes all these allegations. â€˜â€˜We sent them a performa in the beginning to state their area requirement. But despite reminders, they never responded,â€™â€™ said DDA director (commercial land) Surajit Roy.

â€˜â€˜As for problems regarding the so-called lack of infrastructure and amenities, they have contested all these points at the court and lost,â€™â€™ he said.

Fifty six persons had died and 27 persons were killed when fire broke out in the New Alipur Transport Company at Lal Kuan on May 31, 1999.

14,Antony defends govt action on trident issue,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony on Wednesday defended the state government''s decision not to ban distribution of tridents by VHP in the state.

""Government does not think that such an action is necessary,"" Antony told reporters after a Cabinet meeting.

It was for the respective state governments to take a decision on matters like this after considering the circumstances prevailing in each state, Antony said when pointed out that Congress governments in Rajasthan, Assam and Madhya Pradesh have decided to ban distribution of ""trishul"" by VHP.

It was not a national policy of the Congress, but an administrative matter which has to be taken after considering the circumstances prevailing in the state, Antony said.

Antony also downplayed the trident issue in the state and asked ""is it a big issue.""

Antony said he did not consider as a ""compliment"" the reported statement of VHP leader Praveen Togadia that Antony should be made Congress party president.

Asked whether the trishul distribution would cause any problem in the state in the wake of recent violent incidents at Marad which claimed nine lives, Antony said, ""we will take care of that problem when it comes"".

16,Udit Raj invites Maya for mass conversion rally,"NEW DELHI: Dalit leader and Justice Party chief Udit Raj has challenged Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati to embrace Buddhism at a mass conversion function to be organised in Lucknow soon.

In what appears to be an intensifying confrontation between the two Dalit political outfits, Raj on Tuesday accused the UP CM of ""kowtowing"" to the Sangh Parivar and sacrificing the interests of her constituency.

""We are going to organise a Buddhist diksha function at Dr Ambedkar Park, Lucknow; I would request you to be the chief guest on that occasion,"" Raj said in a letter to Mayawati. Asked about the provocation for the step, Raj said, ""We want to see how serious she is about Buddhism."" He termed Mayawati''s threat to embrace Buddhism as a ""cheap gimmick and a ploy to politically blackmail the BJP"".

Making clear his intention to take on Mayawati''s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), he said his party would field candidates in the coming byelections in UP and had plans to fight the assembly elections in four states later this year.

Asked about the chances of an alliance, Raj said teaming up with the Congress and other Opposition parties was a possibility. ""To defeat the communal forces, alliance is a necessity, at least we are not averse to it,"" he said.
