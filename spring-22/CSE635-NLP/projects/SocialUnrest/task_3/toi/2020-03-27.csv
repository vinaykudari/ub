0,Woman back at in-laws home with police help,"NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old woman had to seek police intervention to enter her in-lawsâ€™ home in Vikaspuri last week.

The police said that the victimâ€™s husband was absconding. She alleged that he had left at the instance of her in-laws. They also threw her out of the house and forced her to spend a night on the road.

Deputy commissioner of police (west), Dependra Pathak, said: â€˜â€˜Neelima Narang, 28, and her husband Honey Narang, 22, were married in October 2002 in an Arya Samaj Mandir without informing their families.â€™â€™

Neelima, who stays with her mother in Tilak Nagar, was a receptionist with an automobile company.

After marriage, Neelima asked Honey several times to take her home, but he never did.

â€˜â€˜On January 6, 2003, she entered her matrimonial home on her own. During her stay there, she had regular fights with her in-laws,â€™â€™ she told the police.

Pathak said Honey went missing the day Neelima entered her in-lawsâ€™ house. The victim alleged that he might have changed his mind about the marriage due to the â€˜â€˜age gap.â€�

On March 22, Neelima was not allowed to enter the house. â€˜â€˜Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law had locked the house, forcing her to remain outside on the road. She went to her mother in Tilak Nagar,â€™â€™ the DCP said.

The next day, Neelima complained to the police. â€˜â€˜After investigation, the local police arrested Neelimaâ€™s mother-in-law and sister-in-law,â€� he said.

2,Oppn seeks govt ouster on abduction issue,"PATNA: The spate of kidnapping in Bihar rocked the state legislative assembly here on Thursday during zero hour with the opposition, mostly comprising BJP members, trooping into well of the House and demanding resignation of the government. The matter was raised by some BJP members, with Prem Kumar pointing out that in a very short time there were eight incidents of kidnapping. The kidnapped persons included senior Nationalist Congress Party leader Salauddin, he said and charged the state government with lack of concern in the matter. At this juncture, all the BJP members were on their feet. Levelling various charges against the government, they went into the well of the House and demanded the government's resignation. They raised slogans like Down with Bihar government and Stop kidnapping. Leader of opposition Sushil Kumar Modi said that kidnapping in Bihar had assumed alarming proportions.

Parliamentary affairs minister Ramchandra Purbey merely said that steps were being taken to free the kidnapped persons from their captors. During zero hour, the opposition members criticised urban development minister Shri Narain Yadav for his failure to control mosquito menace in the state capital. The minister deliberately said, Why do mosquitoes bite the BJP and Samata leaders. At this, leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi quipped that a separate minister is needed to tackle mosquito menace in the city. Some members said that mosquito menace had become an all-Bihar phenomenon. The Speaker said that nothing had been done to clean the city and control mosquito menace in the MLA flats area. He asked the minister to get the city cleaned and check mosquito menace by sprinkling of insecticides.

3,Plea to simplify patent laws,"PATNA: As no educational institution in the country, not even the IITs, is imparting any training on the intellectual property right (IPR), most Indian scientists and researchers fail to secure their inventions or innovations from the international agencies which may be attempting to patent our indigenous knowledge base. IPR has been attaining considerable significance following the ever-increasing globalisation and recent advancements in the field of information technology. Expressing these views at a patent awareness workshop organised jointly by the Science College and Science for Society, Bihar, at the Indira Gandhi Planetarium here on Thursday, an advisor of the department of science and technology, New Delhi, R Saha pointed out that no new invention or technology can be purchased by an industry unless it is patented. More than three lakh products and innovations have been patented throughout the world in the recent times. Elaborating the criteria for patenting, Saha said novelty, inventive step and industrial applications of an innovation were judged by the competent body before the award of IPR to the inventor. Even things like needle, gem clip, pin, dogy's bell, coke can and Hoodia cactus plant, used as anti-obesity drug, were patented at one time or the other. Smell of a particular product is also being patented these days. Inaugurating the workshop, science and technology minister Chandrika Rai pleaded for simplification of patent laws and creating mass awareness about IPR. Many of our vaids and hakims had got good knowledge of curing different diseases, but failed to get their formulae patented due to ignorance. Consequently, their knowledge vanished with their death and could not be preserved for the benefit of the suffering humanity. Patna University vice-chancellor K K Jha presided. Former PU vice-chancellor S N Ahsan, in his key-note address, pointed out that patenting in our country was governed by the Indian Patent Act, 1970. Anand Chakravarty was the first scientist in the world to get a living organism patented following the judgement of the US Supreme Court. Bihar has tremendous potential of biotechnical innovations and hence the local scientists should try to find out those substances in various plants which were beneficial for us.Patent examiner from Kolkata B P Singh, patent attorney M Chakraborty, Kolkata IIM professor of economics Nirmal Chandra, Science College principal J Thakur, Bihar Council on Science and Technology director Amitabh Ghosh and Science for Society president K V Srinivasan also expressed their views at the workshop. S P Verma proposed the vote of thanks.

6,Teachers protest delay in Campus of Open Learning,"NEW DELHI: The School of Correspondence Courses in Delhi University has witnessed much discord in the past month. Teachers have been protesting against the delay in the formation of the Campus of Open Learning (COL) and the appointment of an officer on special duty (OSD) as the school head after the acting principal resigned earlier this month.

The teachers say the appointment of the OSD is unnecessary as a director for the COL has already been appointed by the varsity. â€˜â€˜The school had an acting principal, R K Anand, for eight years,â€™â€™ said J Khuntia, School of Correspondence staff council secretary and economics teacher.

â€˜â€˜The university did not appoint a full-time principal as COL was on the cards. Now that Anand has resigned after eight years following protest by teachers, S K Vij, a professor from south campus has been appointed the head of the institute,â€™â€™ he said. The protesting teachers say this will only serve to create confusion in the functioning of the school. â€˜â€˜There is a chairperson-cum-director and an OSD. No one knows what the other is doing,â€™â€™ he added. Anita Dighe was appointed the director of COL last year.

The President of India approved the conversion of the School of Correspondence Courses to COL in 1999. Four years later, the conversion is yet to come through. â€˜â€˜After the acting principalâ€™s resignation, the director should have been handed over his responsibility,â€™â€™ he said.

But Dighe herself refuted the theory. â€˜â€˜Since the school is there, there has to be a principal. And since I am the director COL and the chairperson of the school managing committee I cannot act as the principal as well,â€™â€™ said Dighe.

She, could not say if the school would still be in existence once the COL comes through. Khuntia said the director was appointed only after a report by the dean of sciences K C Tripathi, who was the school OSD between 2001 and 2002.

University proctor Shyam Menon, however, said Dighe was appointed the chairperson to allow her to act effectively as the director COL. â€˜â€˜There were serious allegations against R K Anand. He stepped down to facilitate the inquiry,â€™â€™ said Menon.

He said the OSD has been appointed to tide over the period preceding the conversion. â€˜â€˜Everybody was expecting an overnight transition. Teachers assumed the school will become a university department,â€™â€™ he said.

But there is a statute 19 that prevents that. University teachers have to have certain academic qualifications, he added.
