1,State govt justifies ban on gutkha sale,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has justified its decision to ban manufacture and sale of gutkha as its manufacturers had been repeatedly violating the Prevention of Food Adulteration rules.

In a detailed affidavit submitted by advocate-general Goolam Vahanvati before the Bombay high court on Tuesday to oppose a petition filed by gutkha manufacturers challenging the ban, the government said prosecutions initiated in the past against gutkha manufacturers for violations of rules has not had the desired deterent effect. The court adjourned the matter to August 28 to enable the manufacturers to file their rejoinder.

Shrikant Shrikhande, joint commissioner, Food And Drugs Administration, (FDA) stated in the affidavit that the ingredients used to prepare Gutkha are not only far in excess of the prescribed standards, they are also detrimental to health as enumerated in several studies. For instance, a 1998 report by the public analyst of a sample of Manikchand Gutkha showed the presence of magnesium carbonate in violation of the rules.

Mr Shrikhande said a partial ban on sale of Gutkha and similar products has been existing since february 17, 2000 whereby sale of gutkha has been banned within 100 metres of educational institutions. The ban was challenged and the high court had dismissed petitions filed by gutkha manufacturers. However, the partial ban was not a success and the government therefore on July 23, 2002 imposed a complete ban for five years.

The government had pointed out that the Central committee for food Standards (CCFS) has on several occassions recommended prohibition of the use of chewing tobaco in pan masala or gutkha due to its deletirious effects. The FDA also said the ban does not come as a surprise as claimed by the manufacturers in the petition since the state government had proposed to the Centre in February 2000 to impose a total ban on production and sale of Gutkha. Other states such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have banned sale of gutkha either partially or wholly.

2,Bettiah police ward off communal clash,"BETTIAH: Timely police intervention prevented a communal flare-up in Chawani mohalla here twice on Thursday. A clash between two communities was reportedly sparked by an incident of eve-teasing.

A school girl was harassed on her way home after attending the flag hoisting ceremony commemorating Independence Day at her school on Thursday morning, Bettiah SP Anil Kishore Yadav who rushed to the spot alongwith the DM, Ravi Parmar, told TNN.

After camping at the spot for an hour, the SP and DM defused the tension by talking to members of both communities. As a goodwill measure to instill confidence, some people who were rounded up were released in the afternoon on execution of personal bonds.

However, trouble broke out again late in the evening when one Umesh Yadav was roughed up as he was returning home with milk. However, police once again swung into action before the situation went out of control.

3,Kailashpati blames missionaries for Jharkhand violence,"MUZAFFARPUR: BJP national vice-president and in charge of party affairs in Bihar and Jharkhand Kailashpati Mishra alleged here on Friday that the recent disturbances in Jharkhand were the fallout of a conspiracy hatched by Christian missionaries.

He said that these missionaries have attained the status of a â€œparallel powerâ€� centre in Jharkhand by misleading innocent tribals.

Mishra told mediapersons here that the BJP faces no threat from such missionaries and that there is no proposal to ban them.

However, he said the party is trying to check the nefarious activities of such missionaries by means of efforts being made by national organisations like the Vanvasi Kalyan Kendra, the Sanskar Bharti, the Vidya Bharti, the Seva Bharti and others.

The BJP leader said that about half a dozen non-tribal ministers in Jharkhand, including Yamuna Singh, have become an eyesore for such missionaries who are fanning hatred and hostility in the state in connivance with some opposition parties.

Mishra asserted that non-adivasis would not be uprooted from Jharkhand. Although the five-member local committees being formed at the village-level in rural areas and at the ward-level in urban areas have been authorised to finalise the lists of domicile citizens in Jharkhand, it is a certainty that non-tribals engaged in service or business for long are not going to lose their right of citizenship in Jharkhand, he added.

Enlisting the achievements of Babulal Marandi government, Mishra claimed that over 100 bridges and culverts have been built in the state during his (Marandiâ€™s) regime.

Besides, 5.47 crore new trees have been planted with 100 per cent survival rate, he said, adding that one of the best zoological parks in the country was being built at Oremanjhi near Ranchi.

The BJP leader further informed that joint forest management committees have been formed in 1,400 villages to ensure that 30 per cent of the profits made from forests is given to local villagers.

This apart, 20 bunkers of Naxalites have been dismantled by the state police and 518 new mining leases have been issued by the government in a short span of 18 months. In a way, Jharkhand has tried well to exploit its natural resources, including forests and mines, he claimed.

Referring to the drought and flood condition in Bihar, Mishra criticised the Rabri government for its inefficient handling of the crisis. He said that BJP workers would fan out to rural areas in September and apprise the people about the Central schemes.

The party would then launch an agitation in the state so that the benefits of the Central schemes reach the needy, he added.

4,Govt under fire for failure to arrest Navleen’s killers,"NALLA SOPARA: Social activists, Janata Dal leaders and concerned citizens gathered here on Independence Day to focus attention on their demand that the government brings to book the killers of activist Navleen Kumar.

At a meeting organised by the Dahshatvad Virodhi Kriti Samiti at the Jadeja hall, speakers blasted the Democratic Front government for its failure to nab the killers of Ms Kumar who helped tribals fight for their land rights. Ms Kumar was stabbed by unknown assailants on the terrace of her Nalla Sopara flat on June 19.

Shiraz Bulsara of the Kashtakari Sanghatana said the inability of the police to crack the case only reinforced the belief of the Adivasis that they were in league with the oppressors. State Janata Dal generalsecretary Gopal Dukhande said the police would not get a free hand unless the nexus between the land mafia and politicians was broken. Activist Nikhil Wagle urged the gathering to convert the campaign into a statewide movement. â€œI donâ€™t think it is the murder of an individual, it is an attempt to kill a social movement,â€™â€™ he said.

Members of the Navnirmiti Kala Pathak performed a short skit highlighting the work of Ms Kumar. The skit ended with the artistes raising slogans in Ms Kumarâ€™s memory. An Adivasi woman, Bangabai Valivapada (57), spoke of how Ms Kumar helped her fight against the land mafia. â€œAfter her death, I have been getting threats from strangers,â€™â€™ she said.

Manuel Tuscano, local Janata Dal leader, said the government must review all land deals in Vasai-Virar over the last 20 years as most of them were fraudulent. A significant feature of the meeting was the involvement of the locals. Meanwhile, two of the five arrested in connection with the Navleen Kumar murder case were granted bail by additional sessions judge S.B. Bhale of Palghar on Friday. Gajanan Patil and Sanjay Kadu have been released on bail, said their lawyer Digambar Desai.

The two, who are said to be henchmen of gangster Bhai Thakur, were arrested on June 30.

5,Counter ‘anti-teacher’ action of govt: Puta,"PATNA: The Patna University Teachersâ€™ Association has taken strong exception to the reported arbitrary curtailment of salary and subsequent demotion of university teachers by the state government.

The Puta, at its executive committee meeting held here under the presidentship of Jagannath Thakur, pointed out that contrary to the provisions of the University Act and statutes, the pay fixation cell of the higher education department was engaged in curtailing the salary of teachers and even demoting them to the ranks of readers and lecturers from the post of professor.

The pay fixation cell has been undoing the promotions granted to teachers by an autonomous statutory body, the Bihar State University (Constituent Colleges) Service Commission.

The Puta urged the state government to stop this farcical exercise in the name of pay fixation of university teachers and save the teachers from unnecessary harassment.

It also urged the syndicate to counter this â€œanti-teacherâ€� action of the pay fixation cell.

SC/ST Grievance Cell : Patna University will reconstitute the SC/ST grievance cell for quick redressal of grievances of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students. The cell will have altogether 11 members, including the vice-chancellor and registrar of PU.

Talking to a delegation of the Bihar Harijan Adivasi Studentsâ€™ Union, headed by Ram Babu Kumar, vice-chancellor K K Jha also agreed to initiate the process of filling up the backlog of appointments against the posts reserved for SC/ST categories.

Disciplinary action will be taken against those who violate the reservation policy. He also constituted a three-member inquiry committee, consisting of the registrar, controller of examinations and deputy registrar, to probe the alleged irregularity in appointment of an artist-cum-photographer in zoology department.

Elected to Senate: A member of the Bihar College Service Commission, Mohd Azhar Hussain, has been elected by Bihar Anjuman Taraqqui-e-Urdu to the senate of Veer Kuar Singh University, Ara.

6,Sinking PSUs spark suicide bids,"PATNA: The sinking public undertakings of Bihar have become an ideal breeding ground for employees committing suicide. About half an hour before chief minister Rabri Devi hoisted the national flag in the Gandhi Maidan here on Thursday, a youth Chandan Bhattacharya (25) made a bid to immolate himself on the premises of the Patna High Court.

He was protesting against the non-payment of salary to his father Parijat Bhattacharya, a Bihar State Agro Industries Development Corporation staff, for the last nine years. He sustained 60 per cent burns.

The incident had occurred within 48 hours of another incident, when Kamlesh Sharma put himself afire to demand handing over of the case regarding the murder of his father and the rape of his wife to the CBI.

â€œThe financial condition of all the families is bad. I have not been able to take competitive examinations because there is no money to fill up the forms. I felt that the life I was leading was not worth living and decided to immolate myself in front of the Patna HC to highlight the situation facing the employees and their family members,â€� Chandan said in the Patna Medical College Hospital .

The Bhattacharyas had been switching houses recently because they had no money to pay the rent. Chandanâ€™s father had been trying to meet both the ends as a private tutor. His mother, he recalled, died due to cancer a few years ago. The family did not have the money required for proper treatment to her, and had to sell off its own house, he added.

On the Independence Day, the Patna police had prior notice regarding the likely self-immolation bid by two other persons. One Sudhir Kumar, an employee of the Bihar State Road Transport Corporation, had threatened to self-immolate himself because he was not getting salaries.

Another retrenched employee had threatened to do the same.

A few months ago, a Bihar State Industries Development Corporation staff had committed suicide. â€œMany of us are on the verge of starvation. Suicides cannot be ruled out,â€� said a public undertakingâ€™s employee. Reportedly, employees of Biscomaun and Patna Municipal Corporation have also committed suicide due to the non-payment of salaries.

According to the latest CAG report, of the 54 public undertakings, only the Bihar State Warehousing Corporation has shown profit.

The Bihar State Agro Industries Corporation, whose employee Chandanâ€™s father is, shows an investment of Rs 7.63 crore and a liability of Rs 12.66 crore.

Till March, 2000, the 54 public undertakings had shown an investment of Rs 8,168 crore and a liability of Rs 7,558 crore. The CAG report has suggested that as many as 32 of these undertakings have been in the process of liquidation for the last five to 14 years.

The public undertakings of the state were formed to bring in a new era of development to the state. However, in the last two decades, financial irregularities have been reported from a number of state-owned public undertakings, which have become white elephants.

7,Pro-VC surprised at Presidency seat increase,"KOLKATA: The Calcutta University authorities were informed three days after the Presidency College increased seats in nine undergraduate departments on August 12.

â€œI was not apprised of the decision till August 15. Both higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakrabarty and college principal Amitava Chatterjee called on Thursday to inform me,â€� CU pro-vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das told TNN.

A pro-VC can intervene only in affairs of affiliated colleges. Presidency is a `constituent collegeâ€™ under CU, where decisions can be taken without consulting him.

However, convention demands that he is intimated in writing about a decision before it is implemented. Das was surprised on hearing that the college had admitted the â€œextraâ€� students before informing him. â€œThat is a bit strange. The minister said he had despatched a letter to me. Maybe there has been some delay somewhere,â€� he said. Some CU officials though, saw nothing wrong with the decision. They felt that increasing seats to accommodate more good students to the premier college was â€œperfectly justifiedâ€�.

â€œThere will be no compromise in quality if 10 more students are admitted. They will taken solely on merit. UGC guidelines clearly state the teacher-student ratio should be 1:20, which the Presidency College seldom follows,â€� a senior official said.

8,Official inquiry rules out sabotage at Firpo’s,"KOLKATA: Four months after the Firpoâ€™s Market in central Kolkata was razed to the ground in a fire, the speculation covering the incident now appears all but buried. The governmentâ€™s inquiry committee report, which was submitted on Friday, states that the fire was as an â€œaccidentâ€� and rules out sabotage.

Questions, however, remain over the committeeâ€™s conclusions. The Firpoâ€™s complex at Chowringhee was completely destroyed in a late-night fire during March end.

The report states that â€œthe most probable cause of the fireâ€� was an accident sparked by the â€œnaked flameâ€� from the burning end of a cigarette or bidi. In another section, it says that the forensic report had initially indicated â€œthe use of an accelerantâ€�, which caused it to spread rapidly. The governmentâ€™s report begs the question that if an accelerant had been â€œusedâ€�, how could the fire be termed as an accident.

The report records the statements of witnesses that they had seen some people running away when the fire alarm first spread. However, there is no mention of the follow up action taken by the police about tracing the â€˜runaways.â€™ The most shocking aspect is the probe committeeâ€™s silence on the police report. The committee was chaired by director general of fire services Balkar Singh, with fire services director B.B. Pathak, state chief electrical inspector S.K. Dutta, special additional commissioner of Kolkata Police S.N. Sarkar, and Kolkata Municipal Corporation director general (Buildings) Ashok Roy Choudhury as members. While there are separate chapters on other aspects, the police report is surprisingly missing.

The report itself admitted that lack of security was a problem in the complex. There was only one sweeper who used to double as the marketâ€™s guard. â€œThe management neglected the important aspect of security in the complex,â€� the report stated, adding that this left scope for outsiders to freely come and go, leaving open â€œscope for mischiefâ€�.

The committee was clear only on one point â€” that the Firpo fire was â€œwaiting to happenâ€�. â€œWith the shops in the market mostly dealing in garments, the synthetic fibres, along with diesel stored for the mini generator sets, the market was sitting on a tinderbox,â€� Singh said. It was also stated that the fire was not caused by electrical short-circuit. â€œIn the absence of any specific evidence, the exact cause of the fire remains an open question,â€� the report stated.

State fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee defended the lease holders of the market. â€œThey have told me that they only wish to rebuild the market to the state in which it was, and only the existing shopkeepers would be rehabilitated. If they wished to build a multi-storey complex, that would have raised suspicions. Since they do not wish to do so, there is no scope for suspicion,â€� he said.

The joint action committee is demanding that the transport authority increases auto fares on par with the other neighbouring states, according to a press release issued by the committeeâ€™s convener Mohammed Amanullah Khan. He also alleged the Regional Transport Authority officials were harassing the auto drivers unnecessarily.

10,Four arrested in FFW scam,"KURNOOL: District collector G Sai Prasad ordered an inquiry on Friday into the Food-for-Work (FFW) rice scam, even as vigilance and enforcement officials arrested four persons regarding the seizure of Rs 10 lakh worth of rice in Dronachalam on Wednesday. The officials registered cases against Dronachalam mandal parishad development officer Fazul Basha and panchayat raj assistant engineer M Naik. The collector formed a team of officials, including district supply officer Khurshid Ali, zilla parishad deputy chief executive officer Guravaiah, revenue officer Sai Kumari and R&B deputy executive engineer Sainath, to visit Dronachalam and other villages where FFW works had been taken up and inquire into the scam. The team will submit its report on Saturday, according to a senior officer.

The CPI and CPM too organised a dharna in front of the collectorate demanding the chief minister sack K E Prabhakar from the cabinet. In another development, the district Telugu Desam Party leaders alleged that district Congress president Kotla Suryaprakash Reddyâ€™s close aides were involved in another FFW rice scam. TDP district president Somisetty Venkateswarlu, speaking to reporters here on Friday, said that the local police seized over 100 quintals of FFW rice recently and arrested a person Nageswar Reddy, a fair price shop dealer of Laddagiri in the native village of Kotla. He alleged that Nageswar Reddy was a close relative of Kotla and the rice was being smuggled in two tractors with the support of Suryaprakash Reddy.

12,Cong hails EC decision on Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday welcomed the Election Commission''s decision to defer the Gujarat poll even as the BJP put up a brave face, saying it would win the elections ''hands down'' whenever they are held.

Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said the commission is the principal, if not the sole, constitutional organ entrusted with power to decide when, where and how to hold elections under Articles 324 to 329 of the Constitution.

While saying that all responsible political parties should welcome this decision with grace and dignity, Singhvi pointed out: ""It would be supremely ironical and self-defeating if on one hand we try to assure the international community of free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir through the same Election Commission and at the same time attack it for narrow political reasons in Gujarat.""

On the other hand, BJP parliamentary spokesperson VK Malhotra said: ""Whenever elections are held, we will win hands down. We still hope elections will be held as soon as possible.""

Asked if the EC order was a violation of Article 174 of the Constitution, he said: ""Our interpretation was that elections must be held before October 10, but we still need to study the order.""

Eminent jurist and Rajya Sabha MP Fali Nariman said that as a constitutional authority, the EC was within its rights to decide the timing of the elections in Gujarat, particularly since the decision follows its visit to the state.

""There is nothing unconstitutional about the EC''s decision as long as poll is held within a reasonable time-frame,"" he said.

13,Gujarat polls not before Nov: EC,"NEW DELHI: In a stinging rebuff to the Narendra Modi administration and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Election Commission (EC) has decided that at present, conditions for a free and fair poll to the Gujarat assembly do not exist.

Refusing to announce dates for the polls, the EC says it will review the issue in â€˜â€˜November-Decemberâ€™â€™, before coming to a decision on a schedule.

In a detailed 40-page order issued on Friday, signed by all three members â€” chief James Lyngdoh, T S Krishnamurthy and B B Tandon â€” the EC says the spectacular breakdown of law and order, witnessed during the pogrom against Muslims earlier this year, is yet to be repaired.

It goes on to say that the state government, instead of rectifying the situation, has been trying to suppress facts and paint an optimistic picture which simply does not exist.

So much so, the EC says, Hindus and Muslims are one in distrusting the stateâ€™s ability in these matters. â€˜â€˜The people have lost confidence in the local police, the civil administration and political executive...slow progress in relief and rehabilitation on the one hand and non-arrest and non-punishment of the guilty have ensured against a return to normalcy... (first) confidence-building measures have to be taken with urgency.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Foremost among these would be to arrest and punish the guilty, irrespective of their status and rank... Central para-military forces have to be inducted in large numbers in affected areas... most of all, the people need the balm of generous and humane governance.â€™â€™

Accomplish all this and repair the damage to the electoral roll caused by the violent displacement of tens of thousands of Muslims from their homes all over the state, the EC has directed.

â€˜â€˜After completion of this exercise to correct (voter) rolls and bringing them as up-to-date as possible and creation of conditions conducive for free and fair elections, the Commission will consider framing a suitable schedule for election to the state assembly in November-December,â€™â€™ concludes the order.

The order lists all the legal and constitutional arguments for a quick poll and a poll within a time constraint and explains why none of this is being accepted.

First of all, the EC declares, comes the requirement for a free and fair poll; time constraint arguments are secondary. Elections, the order says, are not a ritual to be gone thro-ugh at regular intervals; every voter has the right to cast a vote in a secure and fear-free atmosphere, at a secure place of stay.

The ECâ€™s order accuses the Modi government of hiding the extent to which the whole state was affected by the violence.

14,President's rule likely in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: A spell of President''s rule with Chief Minister Narendra Modi out of power appears inevitable in Gujarat with Election Commission''s decision not to hold Assembly polls in the state before October.

Holding that the law and order situation in the state was far from satisfactory and the conditions were not conducive for holding free and fair polls, the Commission decided that it would consider framing a suitable schedule for the general election to the state Assembly in November-December.

Despite accepting the contention that there could not be gap of more than six months between two assembly sittings, the Commission held ""the non-observance of the provisions of Article 174(1) in the aforesaid eventuality would mean that the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution within the meaning of Article 356 of the Constitution and the President would then step in"".

Article 174(1) talks about a maximum of six months gap between two sittings of an assembly.

15,Vaghela demands President's rule,"NEW DELHI: Gujarat Congress president Shankersinh Vaghela on Friday demanded immediate imposition of President''s rule in the state following the Election Commission''s decision not to hold early Assembly elections in the state.

Welcoming the EC''s decision, Vaghela told Aaj Tak, ""they have proved the independence of the constitutional body despite the pressures from the Central and state governments and the BJP.""

The poll panel, he said, was convinced during its visits to the state that the administration was ""misleading them.""

Refuting BJP''s claim that the situation in Gujarat was conducive for polls, Vaghela said ""if that is the case, then why they are not holding elections to 87 municipalities and remaining Zilla Panchayats?""

Asserting the Congress was ready to face the polls any time, he said the people of Gujarat, including those dislocated by the riots, had to be readied for it.

He demanded that President''s rule be imposed in the state immediately to ensure that the situation returned to normalcy and free and fair elections were held.

17,Sinha rules out demobilisation of troops,"HAZARIBAGH: Accusing Pakistan of trying to disturb the forthcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, External Affairs minister Yashwant Sinha on Saturday ruled out demobilisation of troops from the border in the ""near future.""

""There will be no demobilisation of Indian troops from the border in the near future...

He accused Islamabad of trying to disrupt the poll process in Jammu and Kashmir by targetting political leaders and innocent civilians and said, ""We will leave nothing to chance to ensure a free and fair election in the state.""

Observing that Kashmir was on international agenda as far Pakistan-sponsored terrorism is concerned, Sinha said that India had conveyed to the international community that it wanted to solve the Kashmir issue through dialogue without any foreign interference.

18,Third accused in Shivani murder case arrested,"NEW DELHI: After a prolong chase the Delhi Police on Saturday finally claimed to have arrested Satyaprakash Sharma, the third accused in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case. He is accused of being part of the criminal conspiracy, along with Haryana cadre IPS officer R K Sharma, to murder Shivani.

But the arrest did not come without embarrassment to the police. Earlier in the day, co-accused Pradeep Sharma was produced in court where he claimed that Satyaprakash was in police custody.

He told the court that Satyaprakash had not only been arrested, but he had even met him. It was only then the police hastily declared that Satyaprakash had been arrested.

Police officials, however, maintained that Satyaprakash had been arrested on Saturday itself. A crime branch team, led by assistant commissioner of police Shivendra Tiwari and inspector

Jasbir Singh Malik, arrested Satyaprakash from a restaurant on the Old Faridabad road. Satyaprakashâ€™s name was disclosed by Sri Bhagwan Sharma, the first accused to be arrested in the case.

Pradeep had also mentioned his name to the police. Satyaprakashâ€™s arrest is an important catch for the police. Sri Bhagwan and Pradeep said Satyaprakash has with him a camera which was stolen from Shivaniâ€™s house after her murder.

The camera is a crucial piece of evidence to prove the involvement of the accused.

A mobile telephone which was used to contact R K Sharma after the murder is also with Satyaprakash. A senior police official said, â€˜â€˜Satyaprakash had called the IPS officer after Shivaniâ€™s murder from this mobile phone.â€™â€™ The phone too has to be recovered from him.

According to the police, Satyaprakash had driven Pradeep and one more person, yet to be identified, to Shivaniâ€™s house in Navkunj Apartments on January 23, 1999. While the two murdered Shivani, Satyaprakash waited for them in a Maruti Esteem. The police have to recover the car which is reportedly in Satyaprakashâ€™s custody.

19,Karunakaran steps up criticism of Antony govt,"THRISSUR: Continuing his criticism of UDF rule under Chief Minister A K Antony, senior Congress leader K Karunakaran on Saturday said the government had failed to live up to the expectations of the people who voted it to power 15 months back, and cautioned against the neglect of the views of the Congress party which headed the ruling combine.

""People continue to suffer"" under UDF rule and the problems would further aggravate if the party was not given due recognition in the affairs of the government, he told reporters here.

Expressing dissatisfaction over handling of the Home portfolio by Antony, he said, ""the police should be asked to act impartially.""

He wanted the government to take into account the sentiments of the Congress workers, which, he said, often reflected the problems faced by the people.

A delegation of State Congress leaders owing allegiance to Karunakaran had last week met AICC chief Sonia Gandhi as part of a mission to air the faction''s grievances about the Antony government''s performance.

20,Two women raped in Najafgarh farmhouse,"NEW DELHI: Two women were sexually assaulted in a farmhouse in Najafgarh on Saturday night. The accused had also committed robbery there. The police have claimed the four accused took away Rs 5,000 and jewellery worth Rs 10,000.

A police official from Najafgarh station said the victims were wives of the farmhouse caretaker and a watchman from the neighbouring farmhouse. â€˜â€˜It seems while the two accused raped the women, the other two thrashed their husbands and relatives in an adjacent room,â€™â€™ a police official said.

According to the police, the farmhouse belongs to a doctor who is a resident of Malcha Marg. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Tejender Luthra said: â€˜â€˜The farmhouse is owned by Roshan Lal who does not live there. It is managed by a caretaker.â€™â€™

On Saturday the caretaker had called over his friend who works as a watchman at a neighbouring farmhouse. All of them were watching television when the assailants barged inside. â€˜â€˜They were armed with knives,â€™â€™ a police official said.

21,Govt flayed for failure to amend development rules,"MUMBAI: The Federation of Tenantsâ€™ Associations of Suburban Mumbai has criticised the state government for allowing rampant construction activity in the suburbs by failing to amend the development control (DC) rules.

The federation, which consists of several tenantsâ€™ associations in the western and eastern suburbs, has blamed the policy of transfer of development rights (TDR), which has caused tremendous pressure on the civic infrastructure in suburban areas like Bandra and Andheri.

The TDR policy, introduced in 1991, encourages a landowner to surrender his property to the BMC for public purposes. In return, he gets an equivalent floor space index FSI) in the form of TDR to either sell or to construct additional floors on existing buildings in the suburbs. In a letter addressed to the government, the federation said when the policy was first formulated, the TDR utilisation in the suburbs was restricted to only 40 per cent or 1.4 FSI. This excluded the congested areas between S.V. Road and the western express highway.

â€œAt present, 80 per cent of all TDR is utilised in the western suburbs. Builders are over-exploiting the over-burdened and overstrained infrastructure,â€™â€™ the federation said. The density of population per square kilometre in the western suburbs is greater than in the eastern suburbs and island city. â€œThe present policy will cause long-term disaster, leading to congestion and traffic chaos,â€™â€™ it observed. â€œAt present, additional floors are constructed on old buildings by utilising TDR FSI without any audit, scrutiny and inspection of the state of existing buildings.

The condition of foundation and superstructure is not taken into consideration. This will endanger the lives of people, especially after thethreat of an earthquake,â€™â€™ it added.

22,"Farmers turn violent, target officials","ANANTAPUR: At least 10 persons, including a mandal revenue officer (MRO), a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), a circle-inspector (CI) and a sub-inspector (SI) were injured when a mob of 1,500-strong farmers turned violent at Kanekal village in Anantapur on Saturday.

These farmers, under the Tungabhadra right bank high level canal (HLC),were demanding release of water to the ayacut areas.

According to eyewitnesses, farmers of Bommanhal and Kanekal mandals have been staging protests at their respective offices of HLC for the past one week seeking immediate release of water from HLC to their fields as the time for planting nurseries was slowly passing away.

HLC-dependent farmers who raised paddy nursery in 30,000 acres around Kanekal and Bommanhal border mandals were seeking an assurance on the supply of water from the district authorities as the irrigation development boardâ€™s meeting was not conducted so far.

The agitating farmers laid siege to the irrigation departmentâ€™s divisional engineerâ€™s office at Kanekal since Friday, and detained the mandal level officers and police personnel overnight.

Even Anantapur MP Kaluva Sreenivasulu and the revenue divisional officer (RDO) of Dharmavaram too failed to persuade the agitating farmers on Friday and the siege continued on Saturday.

At least 1,500 farmers gathered at the office on Saturday morning. Anantapur SP Anjana Sinha who rushed to the irrigation office with additional forces asked the farmers to disperse.

But, the farmers continued with their siege forcing the SP to order a lathicharge. The farmers immediately resorted to stone-throwing and attacked the irrigation department divisional engineerâ€™s office.

The divisional engineer of HLC, Venkateswarulu and MRO of Kanekal, Kullayappa suffered serious injuries in stone-throwing. The farmers then attacked SI Munavar Hussain who tried to rescue the MRO.

Even, Rayadurg CI and a head constable, who rushed to the rescue of the SI, were beaten up by the agitated farmers. Some of the farmers too were injured in the lathicharge. The farmers burnt down two jeeps and a motorcycle.
