0,Shops to display prices of essential commodities,"LUDHIANA: Consumers have reasons to feel elated as the state food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department is all set to enforce mandatory display of prices of essential commodities at all the sale outlets in the open market in the entire state.

The measure is aimed at curbing the malpractices regarding unreasonable prices and the availability of the commodities being sold.

As part of the ongoing drive to streamline the working of the department in the interests of consumers, the minister concerned Avtar Henry has issued standing instructions on Wednesday to all the district food and supplies controllers of the state in this regard.

Notably, the measure that comes under Punjab Commodities Price Marking and Display Order, 1972, had been implemented sparingly so far.

About 20 essential items, including foodstuff, petroleum and petroleum products, coal and durable goods are included in the specified list.

Though no date has been fixed so far to enforce the provision but Henry told TNN over telephone that he has issued strict instructions to his officers to enforce the order.

To start with the dealers (read sellers) would be persuaded to comply with the order through their respective associations within a week.

Those failing to comply would face penal action as per the provisions of Essential Commodities Act. â€œThe bottomline is that the consumer has the right to know the actual price of the commodity he purchases,â€� he said.

The order would be applicable on all the scheduled items barring the packaged ones which normally mention the price and other details.

As per the order, the dealers will be required to display the prices conspicuously during the business hours at a place as near to the entrance of his premises as possible. The price list is to be in Gurmukhi script with international form of the Indian numerals.

If the particular commodity is out of stock, it will be mandatory to mention the same in bold letters against the commodity in the list.

The order empowers the authorised officers to inspect the list of prices during the business hours.

1,Minority engg colleges defy admission rules,"MUMBAI: Some engineering colleges run by minority communities have decided to defy government norms this year by refusing to follow the centralised admissions procedure.

Instead, they are conducting independent admissions for their Bachelor of Engineering courses.

Colleges like Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra, and Watumull Institute of Electronic Engineering and Computer Technology, Worli, have already started selling admission forms independently.

Justifying the decision, Thadomal Shahani college principal Kranti Kumar said, â€œWe are simply exercising the right granted to us by the Supreme Court order of October 2002.â€™â€™

The apex court order permitted private colleges to conduct their own admissions. â€œThe governmentâ€™s insistence on conducting the admissions through a centralised procedure infringes on our autonomy, which the SC order grants,â€™â€™Mr Kumar said.

The Directorate of Technical Education (DTE), which conducts the centralised engineering admissions, is not pleased with this. â€œIf these colleges refuse to admit the students allotted to them through the state merit list, we will be forced to take action against them,â€™â€™ DTE director N.B. Pasalkar said.

He maintained that while minority colleges are free to admit students from their communities to 50 per cent of the seats and admit any students to, or even sell, another 15 per cent of the seats, admissions for the remaining 35 per cent of the seats have to be done according to the state merit list.

According to DTE officials, it is not practical to allow each college to conduct independent admissions.

â€œStudents will have to run from one institution to another filling out forms. Such a move will not only make it difficult to monitor admissions, but will also put a financial burden on the colleges,â€™â€™ an official said. Officials maintained that the centralised admission procedure ensures transparent and merit-based admissions.

But a private college principal said, â€œUltimately the entire issue boils down to the interpretation of the SC order. If the DTE takes action, the matter will once again be dragged to court.â€™â€™

2,Engg admission: Fee concession for low income group,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala government has decided to reduce by half the fee to be paid by students who secured admission to self-reliant engineering colleges on merit and whose annual family income is below Rs 60,000.

Briefing reporters after a cabinet meeting, Chief Minister A K Antony said students belonging to the category need only pay Rs 18,000 as fee instead of the prescribed fee of Rs 36,000. This was decided after the Education Minister Nalakath Sooppy''s meeting with college managements.

He said there was widespread criticism again collecting the same amount from students who were selected on merit and those who got admission through management quota. The government, which could not take a unilateral decision on the matter because of a court judgment, held talks with managements and arrived at the decision.

The cabinet decided to reserve three per cent vacancies of supervisor-officer posts in public sector units to the physically handicapped. The cabinet also approved the Electricity Board''s Pallivasal extension project.

To a question, he said the government was yet to form an expert panel to look into the controversial mineral sand mining project as recommended by the UDF liaison committee.

On the speaker''s reported remark that Congress MLAs were becoming `hostages'' of group leaders, Antony said he did not want to interpret speaker''s comments.

The cabinet decided to appoint Justice Manoharan as the chairman of the backward classes commission.

3,Engineer caught taking bribe from riot victim,"AHMEDABAD: An engineer posted as a surveyor in the Ahmedabad district collectorate, was caught accepting a bribe of Rs 3,000 from a riot victim by the Anti-Corruption Bureau.

The ACB acted on a complaint lodged by a fruit vendor from Bapunagar, Mohammad Rafiq Abdul Shakur Shaikh whose shop had been burnt down during the riots and he had claimed a compensation from the state government.

An amount of Rs 10,000 was recommended for the same. He applied to the Bachat Bhavan for the amount, but it never came through. On June 13 the accused, Vijay Chandulal Parekh who is an additional assistant engineer with the roads and buildings department, came to Shaikhâ€™s residence and told him that his compensation for Rs 10,000 had been approved.

He then added, â€œwhen you get the voucher for this claim what will you give me?â€� Parekh demanded 35 per cent of the amount as illegal gratification which was bargained down to Rs 3,000. Shaikh then complained to the ACB and a trap was set where Parekh was caught when putting the amount in the glove box of his motorbike.

4,1984 riot victims take case to PM,"PUNE: Following a Times of India report (June 13, 2003), which highlighted the continuing ordeal of riot-affected families in Shrirampur since 1984, nearly 50 Sikh families from Ahmednagar district have written to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, state chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde and home minister Chhagan Bhujbal, pleading for help.

Harjeetsingh Wadhwa, spokesman, Shri Guru Singh Sabha, Gobindpura, told TNN that the letters were dispatched on Wednesday, on behalf of impoverished families awaiting compensation.

â€œSome of the families have received sums of Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 from the Centre in 1992. These people had suffered losses worth lakhs. Many others have not even received a single penny. Their files are still gathering dust with the Nanawati Commission,â€� Wadhwa said.

At least the state government could have reserved seats in educational institutions or jobs for the children of the riot-affected, Wadhwa argued, adding, â€œThe total loss of property of the community in Shrirampur alone was over Rs 1 crore.â€�

It may be recalled that the Centre has also failed to waive housing loans of the riot-affected in Srirampur under its own debt relief scheme for victims of the November 1984 riots.

The Maharashtra state housing finance corporation has been demanding the repayment of a Rs 30.29-lakh loan from the Sant Nirankari cooperative housing society.

It has warned that failure to repay the loan would lead to seizure of property. Lucky Sethi, a riot victim, said a majority of affected families had renewed their loan amounts in 1992, because they were unaware of the legalities involved.

â€œSince the papers now show that the loans were taken in 1992 and since many of them have no previous records, they are being denied the waivers,â€� Sethi said.

5,5-point agreement on council polls,"PATNA: The consensus eluded political parties in â€œkeeping away criminals and money power from politicsâ€� during the ensuing council polls for filling up 24 seats representing local bodies.

A meeting convened by Speaker of the state assembly Sadanand Singh and Council Chairman Jabir Hussain saw the CPI and CPM stressing that they would field their own candidates in the polls.

â€œDespite the disagreement, we will try to convince them by June 23 not to field their own candidates. However, the two parties have extended their full support to the all-party efforts to curb criminalisation of politics,â€� said Singh while talking to mediapersons here on Wednesday.

Briefing the mediapersons on the agreement reached at the all-party meet on the issue, Samata Party leader Mangani Lal Mandal said that the agreement had been reached on five points.

According to him, all political parties will make a united effort to create a healthy election atmosphere so that free and fair elections are held, and the ruling party as well as government will make all efforts to ensure free and fair elections.

During the election process, musclemen, criminals and extortionists against whom warrants are pending would be arrested and jailed, and the state government would ensure that no voter is intimidated or kidnapped so that voters cast their votes without fear at the polling booths, Mandal added.

He said that the administration would be directed to take strong action against elements trying to influence the elections, or trying to hijack the election process and also vitiate it. Mandal said the meeting also decided to take action against persons using party flags and banners.

Water resources minister Jagdanand Singh said his government is committed to implement the agreement reached at the all-party meet. â€œThis is an experiment to keep out anti-social elements from politics.With the support of all the parties, the government has gained strength,â€� he added.

Asked how the new move would help in curbing criminalisation of politics, Mandal said there will not be sense of competitiveness among political parties to win the polls and they will be free to advocate strong action against criminal elements. â€œIf political parties do not contest polls then they will not be under compulsion to ensure the victory of a particular candidate,â€� said Speaker Sadanand Singh. Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Narendra Singh also hailed the step taken by political parties to keep out criminal elements.

CPI state secretary Mohammad Jalaluddin Ansari released a separate press release stressing that his party had not agreed with the view held by other parties on not participating in the polls. He insisted that the new move would only help anti-social elements as they would have a â€œfree playing groundâ€�.

Elusive consensus

6,Service to nation above party politics: Govindacharya,"LUCKNOW: Former think-tank of the Bharatiya Janata Party Govindacharya feels that in the last 12 years different kinds of political conglomeration, which ruled the nation, were found to be lacking in spirit and aptitude to serve the people. During the period, he said, the governments stumbled and left people burdened with various problems.

Talking to Times News Network on Wednesday, Govindacharya said that his efforts to build the nation would continue, keeping himself above party lines. To bring his point home, the former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharak recalled the famous quote of Jayaprakash Narayan which said Vyakti se bada dal, dal se bada desh (party is bigger than individual and the country is bigger than party). During the Bihar agitation, JP had tried to invoke the conscience of Congressmen by asking them to rise above party lines.

Confident to attain his goal, Govindacharya, who was in Lucknow to take part in the Swadeshi Sangharsh Yatra, admitted that his decision to take leave from power politics was not sudden, nor it was prompted by the NDAâ€™s failure. He said he was aware of limitations of power politics since the 70â€™s but stayed on with the BJP for some commitment. â€œWhen I realised that nothing could be achieved by clinging on to this outfit, I walked out of it,â€� he said adding that he, however, still had profound faith in Deen Dayal Upadhyaâ€™s ekatma manavavad (integral humanism).

While explaining the spirit behind his quest, Govindacharya said that he would remain active as ever and would explore intellectual pursuits to find an alternative mode of development and networking of voluntary efforts would be taken up to a macro-level.

Govindacharya conceded that the state had a role at the macro level to take pro-people steps but the vested interests in due course gave rise to hegemonistic forces. The state as a whole, he said, had severe limitations in controlling social forces in such a manner as to enable the government take up only pro-people policies.

Recalling his association with JP, he said the Bihar agitation failed as a social deterrent and it could not achieve anything beyond causing political upheavals. He said even JP was not satisfied with change but his health did not permit him to make another bid and, in the process, his entire mission was lost. About the political systemâ€™s inability to bring in drastic changes, he quoted the famous line of Rajiv Gandhi which said that majority of funds meant for the poor were lost on the way.

Govindacharya said that he planned to work for uplift of the poor and also identified 2,000 people for carrying out his work all over the country. But such a gigantic task, he said, could not be achieved easily. Govindacharya said that some one had to take an initiative and he had already forged ahead in this direction. He reminded people how Mahatma Gandhi had said that one right step was good enough to achieve the goal.

When asked whether he would accept help from Congressmen in his quest to serve society, he said he was willing to cooperate with anyone in his fight against hunger and poverty though, till now, he had no offers from them. Political affiliations and ideological fetters should not come in the way to serve the people, said the former BJP ideologue.

8,Uttaranchal minister quits amid scandal,"DEHRA DUN: Uttaranchalâ€™s revenue minister Harak Singh Rawat tearfully announced his resignation in the state assembly on Wednesday, after he was accused of having made a woman pregnant.

Speaker Yashpal Arya adjourned the House four times, after Opposition parties refused to allow the assembly to function and demanded a discussion on the issue. Arya finally sent a five-member all-party delegation to visit the woman and confirm the fact. They came back with their report, which he sent on to the government. As the Opposition was shouting for it to be tabled in the House, Rawat tearfully said he had been framed by his own colleagues and members of the Opposition, with help from the governmentâ€™s chief secretary.

â€˜â€˜I am resigning and will return to this House only after my name is cleared...my wife and I had only tried to help this woman,â€™â€™ he said.

Chief minister Narayan Datt Tiwari was absent from the House throughout the day and the Speaker adjourned proceedings once Rawat announced his resignation.

Opposition leader Bhagat Singh Koshyari later led a delegation to state governor Sudarshan Agarwal, stating that Rawatâ€™s allegations against his own colleagues and the chief secretary called for the Tiwari Cabinetâ€™s immediate dismissal.

The woman, Jaini (24) from Assam, has been in a government home for destitute women for the past seven months.

9,Patnaik govt ambivalent about Nalco disinvestment,"BHUBANESWAR: CITU on Thursday said that Orissa government''s ambivalent stand on the proposed 30 per cent disinvestment in the National Aluminium Company Ltd (NALCO) is hurting the state''s interests.

Chief Minister Navin Patnaik has stated he was opposed to privatisation but supported disinvestment, CITU General Secretary M K Pandhe told reporters here, adding that was akin to supporting privatisation through the backdoor.

""Either you oppose or support the disinvestment, you can''t help anyone by taking such an ambivalent stand"", he said.

Congratulating NALCO employees for the ""valiant"" struggle they had launched to oppose the country''s drift towards privatisation, he said all central trade unions were considering the proposal to observe July 18 as national day of solidarity with the NALCO employees.

A statement in this regard would be issued within a couple of days, he said.

The issue would also be forcefully raised by opposition MPs in the forthcoming session of Parliament beginning in the third week of July next, Pandhe said.

The people of Orissa should also join this struggle in the interest of the state and stand solidly behind the NALCO workers.

Pandhe wondered how private companies, who had failed to pay tax to the government totalling a staggering Rs 1.52 lakh crore within the last three years, were able to raise funds to acquire public sector units.
