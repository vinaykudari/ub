1,Soaps expose kids to violence: Study,"mumbai: if you think children are hooked to cartoons, action flicks and adventure series, you are behind the times. soap operas are what they are watching â€”adult family dramas, in particular. they are also keen on horror and crime shows, and this fascination has intensified dramatically since september 11. so says a recent study on â€˜media violence and its impact on childrenâ€™, conducted by the centre for advocacy and research (cfar) in delhi with the support of unicef, unesco and the ford foundation. the pioneering survey covered 1,350 kids in the agegroup of six to 14 years from various socio-economic groups in five citiesâ€”lucknow, calcutta, delhi, hyderabad and ahmedabad. parents might consider family serials â€˜safeâ€™ for their kids, with many mothers encouraging their children to watch these alongside their elders.however, such programmes, especially the new crop of daily soaps, are injurious to the psychological health of children, warns the study. cfar conducted a content analysis of 22 episodes across prime-time television, comprising 11 family dramas, and found that more than 55 per cent of their substance was violence. â€œconflict, emotional upheaval, violence, death and uncertainty come packaged as a family drama,â€™â€™ says the study, adding that this can only â€œimpair impressionable mindsâ€™â€™. â€œfamily soaps are not necessarily happy programmes or merely a celebration of the family, although they are promoted that way,â€™â€™ notes akhila sivadas, executive director of cfar. â€œthese soaps may be called family dramas but that does not mean they can be watched by the whole family.they are, in fact, bad for kids,â€™â€™ adds cfar senior researcher shailaja bajpai. their target audience is the adult viewer, the researchers point out, hence the topics deal with adult life and its complexities. domestic discord, adultery and bigamy are common themes. unfortunately, though, the serials end up being watched by vast numbers of children tooâ€”â€�two kids to one mom,we could say. and given that the kids lack the emotional and intellectual maturity to understand whatâ€™s really going on, they turn precocious and start acquiring prejudices and preconditioned ideas about relationships.â€™â€™ â€œparents are encouraging their children to watch these programmes because they believe they are a good dose of family values and tradition, with characters such as mihir and tulsi in kyun ki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi being seen as positive hindu role models,â€™â€™ notes ms bajpai.â€œin addition, they find it easier to discuss issues such as illegitimacy with their children through the serials. while this is leading to more frankness between parents and children, it is also taking away from the kidsâ€™ innocence.â€™â€™ the study was an eye-opener. â€œwe were struck by the obsessive manner in which the children follow the lives of the characters in heir favourite soap. for instance, the death of mihir in saas bhi left many of the kids, boys included, with a real sense of loss and sorrow,â€™â€™ says ms sivadas. of all the clips shown to the children as part of the study to test their knowledge of various tv programmes, the best remembered was the one of mihirâ€™s death. the popularity of tulsi and mihir as role models is borne out by the fact that at a recent mr india contest, one young man declared that he would prefer to share his life with a pati-vrata like tulsi than with a dancer like vani ganapathy or a glamorous actress like raveena tandon. the researchers were also alarmed by the childrenâ€™s passion for crime and horror showsâ€”the kids said they rushed through their homework so that they could watch them.they confessed that they were fascinated by visuals of the wtc collapse and now the gujarat carnage, and that they had become more addicted to gruesome serials since then. however, many confessed that they got bad dreams after watching such shows.

2,Army proposes new staff policy,"pune: the indian army has drafted a paper on the reconstruction of its cadres in view of challenges of technology and professional development in the new millennium. this was revealed by lt. gen. narayan chatterjee, director-general of the army''s manpower planning and personnel services while addressing reporters on the last day of the annual recruitment conference held at the southern command headquarters, here on friday. lt. gen. chatterjee said that the draft policy was submitted to the defence ministry a few weeks ago. it will be later reviewed by the group of ministers (gom). the draft policy takes into account issues such as capacity addition in feeder institutions of the army, opening up of certain posts in combat units for women and a thrust on training officers in information technology (it), he said. the draft discusses fast-track promotions for officers and other personnel, the general added. the paper has recommended the lowering of age stipulations for commanding officers, especially at the brigade level. ""the need to bring down the age profile of commanding officers was noticed during the kargil war,"" he pointed out. while admitting that the army faced a whopping shortfall of 14,000 officers, chaterjee promptly added that there was no cause for concern. several talented youths had once again enrolling for defence jobs in view of it meltdown in particular and the economic slowdown in general. ""the number of applications to the national defence academy (nda) in khadakwasla, pune has gone up in last few years. and the army has never lowered its selection standards at any point of time,"" he affirmed. moreover, it would be launching a media campaign from may this year to attract the best talent in the country to the army. in an attempt to upgrade the knowledge of its officers on a continous basis, the army is also holding talks with leading academic institutions like the indian institute of managements (iims), he said. answering a question about the army''s retirement policy, he said there is a proposal to consider the introduction of the voluntary retirement scheme (vrs) in the army. he declined to comment on the issue any further. the senior official said that the zonal recruitment offices (zros) across the country were going to interior districts of each state to get a better response from youths in low turnout regions. ""recently, a recruitment rally at mhow attracted boys from backward tribal areas of madhya pradesh, thanks to awareness drives by branch recruitment officers,"" he said. gen. chatterjee denied reports that certain states were not responding to the call of the army at all. significantly, the senior officer said that the army was thinking of bringing all sainik schools in various states under its control to monitor the quality of their curricula and education standards. the proposal comes in the wake of reports that several sainik schools had not been following norms for grooming officer material. he denied any complaints about delays in the payment of ex-gratia to soldiers killed on duty. grants have been declared in the case of the families of even those soldiers and officers who have died in the latest build-up on the western borders (operation parakram).

3,Gujarat not ready for snap polls: Congress,"ahmedabad: not only does the congress seems to be taken aback by bjp''s surprise nod for snap polls in gujarat, the party does not seem to be in any mood to even lend credence to this move. a high-level congress delegation headed by cwc members like r k dhawan, l p sahi and former minister of state for home affairs subodh kant sahay, who were in ahmedabad, said, ""gujarat is not ready for any elections."" l p sahi, senior congress leader, said, ""we have visited a large number of relief camps in ahmedabad and vadodara, and the godhra massacre site. at each place we found that the common man is scared. at the relief camps, even a suggestion that people should go back home (to the same places they have stayed for years together) sets the victims trembling with fear."" r k dhawan said that since party chief sonia gandhi was not allowed by the state government to visit all the relief camps during her recent visit, ""we have come on a fact finding mission."" ""in each camp a deep sense of insecurity reflected amongst the riot-victims. giving a call for elections at such a sensitive juncture is not justified. however, we have full faith in the election commission''s decision. if even a drought can postpone polls then the ec won''t allow bjp to take gujarat to polls,"" said dhawan. another cwc member mukul wasnik added, ""even on friday there was violence in danilimda area. narendra modi will not be able to contain rioting in gujarat and thus won''t be able to succeed in his designs."" ""even if bjp does go for polls, it will loose gujarat,"" asserted subodh kant sahay while speaking to tnn. ""after the babri masjid was vandalised bjp had infact lost four states -- uttar pradesh, rajasthan, madhya pradesh and himachal pradesh. hindus are not extremists and this will be proven once again in gujarat when ever the state assembly goes for polls.""

4,Gloom in SP camp as party gets sidelined,"lucknow: if the meeting of the samajwadi party office-bearers, mps, mlas and mlcs, besides local body chiefs on saturday is anything to go by, the mood in the party is most definitely one of pronounced anguish and frustration. sp chief mulayam singh yadav lamented the fact that his party had not been invited to form the government in up, and termed it as a â€œviolation of the peopleâ€™s mandateâ€� on the ground that the sp had emerged as the single largest party in the newly-elected vidhan sabha. mulayam insisted that the sp was the only party which had staked its claim to form the government in up. he added that even the combined strength of the bjp and the bsp would only amount to 185 mlas, which would be far short of the number required for a simple majority in the house. alleging that the bjp was trying to project itself as the only party which was fighting terrorism, yadav pointed out that he himself had demanded an attack on pakistan-based terrorist training camps soon after terrorists had attacked devotees on their amarnath yatra. he deplored the bjpâ€™s position that the gujarat violence was the fall-out of the godhara train massacre. mulayam stressed that no one could be allowed to take the law into his own hands. partymen highlighted their displeasure with gujarat chief minister narendra modi and even demanded his arrest. mulayam later exhorted his partymen to participate in large numbers in the sit-ins and demonstrations being organised by the party on april 17 and also to extend financial help to the party candidates contesting for membership of the vidhan parishad from the teachersâ€™ and graduatesâ€™ constituencies. mulayam even went to the extent of advising his party voters to be very particular about their second preference votes. â€œyou must cast your second preference votes, as sometimes they tend to play a very important role in these elections,â€� he stressed.

5,BJP to ride popularity wave in polls,"gandhinagar: the rousing welcome that was accorded here on saturday night to chief minister narendra modi, who alighted the flight from mumbai amidst chants of ""chhote sardar zindabad,"" has firmed the bjp''s resolve to seek the people''s mandate as early as in june. the bjp is taking the outpouring of emotions of the people at the sardar vallabhbhai patel airport here as a ""happy sign"". bjp leaders are voicing more strongly what cabinet spokesperson i k jadeja told tnn on saturday morning: ""it will take at least one-and-a-half months for the elections to take place if modi goes in for dissolution of the assembly immediately."" he hinted that elections will be held in june. after a day of calculations it was time to greet modi in the evening as his cabinet colleagues like ashok bhatt and gordhan zadaphia welcomed him at the airport, where about 3,000 people had gathered. as soon as modi drove out of the vip exit of the domestic terminus around 9.30 pm, accompanied by keshubhai patel, chants of ""chhote sardar zindabad"" and ""desh ka neta kaisa ho, narendra modi jaisa ho,"" rent the air. modi made an impromptu address. ""my primary duty will be to wipe the tears of the people and lead gujarat with a new spirit,"" he announced. he took his usual pot-shots at the press, criticising it for ""maligning gujarat."" though modi did not say anything about the elections, he hit out at the congress, calling them conspirators and ""trying to malign the state."" earlier in the day, jadeja had claimed that ""electoral rolls have been revised and the elections can be held immediately."" there is, however, no word on this from the central election commission. while party members could not say when modi is likely to meet the governor to recommend dissolution of the assembly, sources said he will hold consultations with senior party members, including state bjp president rajendrasinh rana and former chief minister keshubhai patel on sunday ""to draw up a roadmap for the party."" ""all crucial aspects of holding elections like the law and order situation, geographical conditions and problems of water and electricity would be discussed threadbare,"" the sources said. the party quotes ""intelligence reports"" as saying that it would get a solid majority in the 182-seat assembly in case the elections are held before the monsoon. a senior bjp leader told tnn, ""the main achievement of the bjp over the last six months has been allowing the pent-up hindu anger to explode,"" and this would help the party in the polls. bjp leaders say the situation would ""automatically return to normal once the elections are held."" the congress, taking a diametrically opposite view, claimed the electoral rolls in most parts of the state ""have not been revised"" and it has checked with the election commission. congress legislature party leader naresh raval said, ""the election commission has said the rolls will be revised by may-end. thereafter, the monsoon will come, when there can be no elections. a large number of muslims live in the relief camps. their rehabilitation would have to precede any polls."" chief electoral officer gurcharan singh refused to comment on when the elections might be held. he believes such matters are decided by the headquarters in new delhi, not in gandhinagar.

6,BJP wants polls by June,"gandhinagar: the bjp wants elections to the gujarat assembly to be held by early june. cabinet spokesperson i k jadeja told tnn on saturday, ""it will take at least one-and-a-half months for the elections to take place if chief minister narendra modi goes in for dissolution of the assembly immediately."" he claimed: ""all electoral rolls have been revised and the elections can be held immediately."" there is, however, no word on this from the central election commission. ministerial sources indicated, ""early elections depend on how quickly modi finishes the rehabilitation work."" while party members could not say when modi is likely to meet the governor to recommend dissolution of the assembly, sources said he will hold consultations with senior party members, including state bjp president rajendrasinh rana and former chief minister keshubhai patel on sunday ""to draw up a roadmap for the party."" ""all crucial aspects of holding elections like the law and order situation, geographical conditions and problems of water and electricity would be discussed threadbare,"" the sources said. ""there was a move to impose president''s rule and then have kashiram rana steer the state till the polls. this possibility has been ruled out,"" they said. the party quotes ""intelligence reports"" as saying that it would get a solid majority in the 182-seat assembly in case the elections are held before the monsoon. a senior bjp leader told tnn, ""the main achievement of the bjp over the last six months has been allowing the pent-up hindu anger to explode,"" and this would help the party in the polls. bjp leaders say the situation would ""automatically return to normal once the polls are held."" the congress, taking a diametrically opposite view, claimed the electoral rolls in most parts of the state ""have not been revised"" and it has checked with the election commission. congress legislature party leader naresh raval said, ""the election commission has said the rolls will be revised by may-end. thereafter, the monsoon will come, when there can be no elections. a large number of muslims live in the relief camps. their rehabilitation would have to precede any polls."" meanwhile, insiders in the bjp say, legally it would be ""untenable"" to hold the elections six months before they are actually scheduled - in february 2003. union law minister arun jaitley is quoted as saying that the central election commission will ""not allow the elections to take place before october 2002."" the cec may even take the view that the bjp is trying to hold the elections taking advantage of the riots - a reason that will go against holding the polls in june. chief electoral officer gurcharan singh refused to comment on when the elections might be held. he believes such matters are decided by the headquarters in delhi, not in gandhinagar. but senior bureaucrats, who have been watching the political developments closely, feel the cec will not reveal its cards before modi actually goes in for dissolution of the assembly. there is also the apprehension that with the nda partners of the bjp becoming jittery, both assembly and parliamentary polls might be held together.

9,‘BJP making political capital',"hyderabad: the telugu desam party (tdp) on saturday strongly criticised the bjp for advising gujarat chief minister narendra modi to go for elections rather than resign. it said the move amounted to using â€œthe noble process of elections for achieving blatantly narrow and communal endsâ€� and reiterated its demand for a change in the leadership in gujarat. the tdp politburo met at the residence of chief minister chandrababu naidu on saturday evening to calibrate the partyâ€™s response to the bjpâ€™s rejection of its earlier demand for the sacking of modi. the meeting weighed various options and passed a strongly worded resolution disapproving the bjpâ€™s adamant stance on gujarat. â€œto say that elections will be held in gujarat is in our view (an attempt) to make political capital out of a human tragedy. it is a covert attempt to clothe narrow and partisan ends with the legitimacy of a democratic process.â€™â€™ the tdp policy-making body also said, â€œthe leadership in gujarat has lost its moral authority to govern and the devious use of the electoral process cannot restore such authority. the need of the hour is not elections, but immediate restoration of peace and normalcy.â€™â€™ recalling the words of mahatma gandhi â€” â€œmy notion of democracy is that under it the weakest should have the same opportunity as the strongestâ€� â€” the party said it was opposed to using â€œthe noble process of elections for achieving blatantly narrow and communal endsâ€�. the party asserted that secularism was a fundamental principle for the tdp and strict adherence to it was one of the â€œbasic conditions for our support to the nda alliance at the centre.â€™â€™ the resolution further said, â€œthe tdp firmly believes that india is a plural society, and divisive forces cannot take the country forward. after the serious outbreak of violence in gujarat, there has been a total failure of the administration in restoring peace and normalcy.â€™â€™ the party said there have been accusations of gross partiality and complicity on the part of the administration in tackling the law and order situation, and added that effective and impartial interventions by the law and order enforcement agencies would certainly have curbed the gross human tragedy that has unfolded over the past few weeks. â€œthe observations of many impartial individuals and organisations point to the many lapses of the gujarat government in curbing violence and in attending to relief and rehabilitation for the hapless victims. we therefore reiterate our demand for a change in the leadership in gujaratâ€�, the resolution stated.

12,Kashmiri pandits flay political parties,"new delhi: as political parties vie with each other in expressing concern over the plight of communal violence victims in gujarat, kashmiri pandits on saturday criticised the political spectrum for ""maintaining a deafening silence"" over the ""sufferings"" faced by a populace of more than 3.5 lakh after their migration due to militancy in 1990. ""kashmiri pandits can understand the plight of victims of the gujarat violence as we have also undergone similar sufferings,"" said kashmiri samiti president sunil shakdher. he, however, alleged that the gujarat incidents had ""exposed"" the double standards of the political parties, particularly the ""so-called secularists"".

18,Paridhi’s flight from trade to politics,"patna: for convent educated 30-year-old paridhi prasad, the patna municipal corporation (pmc) elections offer not only an opportunity to educate oneself in politics, but also educate the voters. paridhi is contesting pmc polls from the ward no. 12 and it is just the beginning of her career in this field. she presents herself differently to different group of voters. sometimes, she tries to emulate the style of laloo and rabri. though a â€œnoviceâ€� in the field of politics, paridhi maintained, â€œvoters ko alag alag tarike se handle karana parata haiâ€�. (i have to handle voters in different ways). paridhi, who was running a shop of â€œhome appliancesâ€� on her own in the city for the last five years because of her husbandâ€™s engagement in some other work, has decided to switch over to politics. besides, she also runs a non-government organisation. the experience gained by her during the election campaign is indeed interesting. she said: â€œmost of the voters have no knowledge of the different roles of mps, mlas and ward councillorsâ€�. she said one of the voters told her, â€œaap logon ko hamesha apna fayada dikhata hai, hamari samasya nahinâ€�. (you people seek only your gain and do nothing to solve our problems.) taking about her campaign, she said it was not a good experience. â€œbut i know politics is a game of patience and subsequently decided to take things calmly,â€� she added. â€œpeople residing in posh areas are more interested in the educational qualification of a candidate, while residents of the slum areas want to know about your caste,â€� she further said. â€œit is not an easy task to convince them. i asked them what do they gain when they get their daughters married to a man belonging to a particular caste,â€� paridhi added. but what prompted her to contest the pmc polls? she replied: â€œi had planned to join this field while i was studying in the patna womenâ€™s college. i have got my husbandâ€™s support.â€� paridhi admits that contesting an election is indeed a tough job and it is not easy to woo voters. whatever the result, she will not give up.
