0,Criminals from outside rule the roost in city,"NEW DELHI: In January this year, a sum of Rs 9 lakh was robbed from a house in Shastri Park. So far, the robbers have managed to evade arrest. The reason: Police say the accused are based in Uttar Pradesh and that they do not have any concrete information about their activities.

In March, nine members of a gang of robbers were arrested from northeast Delhi. They were ''wanted'' for a series of six robberies. But the police had no past record or information about this Meerut-based gang. This, despite the fact that they were ''wanted'' in 12 cases of robbery in UP as well.

According to the police, criminals from the neighbouring areas take advantage of multiple enforcement agencies in the National Capital Region (NCR). ""There is movement of criminals across borders and they take advantage of the fact that the local police may not have any criminal records against them,"" said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Praveer Ranjan.

Moreover, when it comes to coordination at the ground level, a vital link seems to be missing between the Delhi Police and their neighbouring counterparts. Though inter-state coordination meetings have been going on for a long time, they have gained an impetus only in the last two years. Though the process of sharing of information about crime and criminals has begun, the police cannot afford to pat their backs just yet.

A senior officer said: ""There is coordination and cooperation at the senior level between Delhi and its neighbours. But, it is the rapport among the lower-rung police staff which needs to be improved. Until that happens, criminals will take advantage of the difference in the jurisdiction of Delhi and other areas of the NCR.""

Another officer said Delhi Police''s priority may be different from that of neighbours. ""We may want them to take action against a particular gang or person on an urgent basis, but they may have other priorities. Moreover, the criminals wanted here may be lying low to prevent detection,"" the officer added.

The answer to the problem, according to joint commissioner of police (New Delhi range) Maxwell Pereira, lies in local vigilance. He said: ""Delhi is not a personalised society and any incursion is not immediately known. The only way to curb criminal incursions is to improve local vigilance.""

Seems it''s not just neighbours India and Pakistan which should improve their coordination but also the Delhi Police and their next-door neighbours.

1,"Joshi blames Govt for poor law, order","ALLAHABAD: Union HRD Minister MM Joshi addressed over a dozen meetings in the Karchana Assembly segment in trans-Yamuna area on Monday. He was accorded a warm welcome by local people who assured him that they would extend full support to him to ensure his fourth consecutive victory at the hustings.

Braving scorching sun, villagers turned up in good numbers. At different meetings, about 50 Dalits and 100 others, belonging to backward castes, joined the BJP. Addressing a meeting at Deeha Bazar, Joshi lambasted the Mulayam Government for deteriorating law and order situation in the state.

He alleged that there was a spurt in kidnapping, daylight murder, dacoity and land grabbing cases in the state. He alleged that Yadav had failed to fulfill his promises which he had made to the people before coming to power. No effective measure was taken up to augment the irrigation facility.

Joshi remarked that the BJP was committed to remove the socio-economic disparity and setting up of a society based on equality and development. Recounting various achievements of the BJP-led NDA government, he also highlighted various developmental works, including Kodharghat bridge, initiated by him in the trans-Yamuna area.

2,City development blueprint caught in time-warp,"MUMBAI: While the state governmentâ€™s â€˜Vision Mumbaiâ€™ project may seek to botox the city for the new millennium, the civic authorityâ€™s design for Mumbai is still stuck in the past.

The BMCâ€™s development plan â€”a critical blueprint mapped out every 20 yearsâ€”expired in 2001, but was extended for 10 years. Officials claimed this was done because they needed more time to implement the plan.

But urban experts say the moveâ€” coupled with the fact that the plan is barely implementedâ€”shows how much planning is disregarded by the civic authorities. â€œGiven how rapidly the city has been changing in the last decade, a review is vital to keep the plan relevant,â€™â€™ says city architect Arvind Adarkar,who feels that the plan needs to be upgraded every five years.

Agrees Joy Gopal Sanyal, a property expert with Chesterton Meghraj, â€œIf Mumbai wants to be an international city, it has to update the plan to cope with increasing infrastructure and population needs.â€™â€™

The plan projects the growth of the cityâ€™s population, determines how land should be utilised and chalks out sites for public amenities like housing, schools and recreation grounds.

One simple example of the need for updating the plan: the city needs more parking lots, given that the number of vehicles registered in Mumbai doubled in the 1991-2001 period, crossing 11 lakh at the turn of the millennium.

Adarkar also notes that one reason for the current hawkersâ€™ fiascoâ€” where the city has over one lakh street vendors but legal spaces for only 36,000 of themâ€”is that the plan failed to forecast properly for this need. While heritage activist and environmentalist Shyam Chainani cites the sudden spurt in high-rises everywhere. â€œWe have no provisions in the plan for new infrastructure needs,â€™â€™ he says.

BMC officials claim they need more time to implement the plan, but the records show that the plan is more flouted than followed. Some estimate that barely 15 per cent of the plan has been implemented.

Of the 2,300-odd plots reserved for recreation grounds, playgrounds and gardens in the last development plan, for example, only a little over 500 had seen the light of day.A large proportion of the rest harbour encroachments.

â€œThe BMC has never tried to seriously implement it,â€™â€™ says conservation architect Pankaj Joshi. â€œEven when this plan was being made, it was compromised because several politicians said donâ€™t put reservations here and there. But even this compromised dream is not being realised.â€™â€™

Not only has the plan stayed largely on paper, but over the years, it has been modified consistently to change or remove reservations.

Civic activists have hundreds of cases where playgrounds have been eaten up by commercial interests, most recently, when the state government decided to hand over half the Byculla zoo to Mafatlals.

That planning is not taken seriously at all is evident in the fact that the BMCâ€™s development plan department has no trained planners, only engineers. â€œEngineers donâ€™t really have the design or aesthetic skills for this job,â€™â€™ says urban planner Prakash Apte, adding that it is shocking that the countryâ€™s biggest and richest urban authority should have no planner.

Agrees Joshi, â€œAt the end of the day, all the changes are decided by the corporator, the urban development department and the builder.â€™â€™

3,Do political rallies influence the electorate?,"JALAUN: Innumerable rallies are being held by the political parties to woo voters. Do they really help in garnering votes or improving the prospects of the candidates? No doubt certain rallies, especially involving political bigwigs, leave a mark but others serve as mere crowd pullers.

One person who draws crowds, in summers, winters and rains is Mayawati. She sure knows the public pulse! In a rally here she spoke about her candidate and how one should vote. Aware that her candidate Brij Lal Khabri''s nayi biwi and naya ghar have become an election issue here, she declared openly from the rostrum that she has warned Khabri and if he does not mend his ways, he would not be given the ticket again. As the public applauded, she asked them to forgive him and vote for her. She further explained to the spellbound audience that they are to press only the button against the elephant, and that too only after ensuring that a lamp is alight beforehand.

Sushma Swaraj, too came here for a rally. But she was far removed from the ground reality. Throughout her speech, she criticized Sonia Gandhi, oblivious of the fact that the Congress candidate here is no-go. She hardly talked about her candidate or problems facing Bundelkhand region.

Her listeners were heard terming her speech as crammed up. She seems unable to get over her defeat by Sonia Gandhi in Bellary. Vinay Katiyar''s rally saw barely 1,000 people. Pramod Mahajan joked about the scarcity of numbers in his rally. It is evident that voters are not interested in these rallies, which do not leave any profound impact on them. Mulayam''s rallies have seen good crowds and he is promising uninterrupted power supply, water for irrigation and all round development for Bundelkhand. Congress party has not conducted even a single rally here.

A local MLA and senior minister in the erstwhile BJP Government, Babu Ram M Com, popularly known as Dada, said these rallies are held to create an environment in favour of the party. ""Stars are merely used to add glamour to the campaigning and attract public to the rallies,"" he added.

4,"Annul Hassan election, demands Nanje Gowda","BANGALORE: Even as the Hassan deputy commissioner ordered an inquiry into how voter identity cards were found in a drain here, JD(U) leader H.N. Nanje Gowda demanded countermanding of the Hassan Lok Sabha election.

Gowda, who contested from Hassan, on Monday said the finding of voter identity cards in drains is a smack on democracy. ""This is a fit case for the election process to be declared invalid for Hassan LS seats and its eight assembly segments,"" he contended.

""Thousands of voters could not exercise their right as they did not find their names on the rolls. The discovery of voter I-cards in drains lends credence to the discrepancies,"" Nanje Gowda alleged. He also demanded a CBI probe into the issue.

5,Pre-monsoon rains raise farmers' hopes,"MYSORE: Farmers of Mysore district are a happy lot today. Thanks to bounty of pre-monsoon rains their area is experiencing.

After three years of consecutive drought and dry spell, the district is witnessing heavy pre-monsoon showers sufficient to raise Kharif crops.

It all started a month ago. First spell of pre-monsoon showers hit the district soon after Ugadi - the beginning of a New Year of lunar calendar. Since then the district is regularly receiving rains and especially the incessant drizzling for the last 24 hours has raised new hopes among farmers involved in Kharif cultivation.

According to farmers this incessant drizzling is good for cultivation and sowing as this kind of rain will drench the soil properly. ""Continuous drizzling and light showers not only soak the soil very well, even it retains moisture for a longer time helping the crop to withstand long dry spell"" says Dineshkumar a farmer from Dasankoppalu village in city outskirts who has not got any yields from the field for the last three years.

According to him farmers will now take up sowing of short duration kharif crops which need less rains to grow such as horse gram, green gram, black gram, ragi, bajra and other cereals. ""These rains will also help the farmers to prepare their land for raising the main Kharif crops such as ground nut, paddy and other long duration pulses in June when regular monsoons set in"" he claimed anticipating good rains this year. ""There are all signs of district receiving normal rains this year"" he added.

According to the agriculture department sources as against a normal rainfall of 65.9 mm in April Mysore district received 98.3 mm of rains.

The Joint Director of Agriculture R Krishnaiah disclosed that normal cumulative rainfall is 87.4 mm from January to April. But this year district received 107.03 mm against 58.4 mm rainfall corresponding period last year.

Most satisfying factor for the farmers is that rains are widespread and evenly distributed across the district, while it was scanty and concentrated in few pockets last year. All the eight taluks have been blessed with copious showers, Krishna said.

Farmers are back in fields brimming with hope as rains are an augury for good tidings in the days to come, Krishnaiah opined revealing that department had set a target of bringing 3,65,524 hectares of land under crop cover this year.

Emphasis is being accorded to cereals which will cover 1.87 lakh hectares, he added.

While 56,191 hectares of land in the district would be brought under pulses, Oilseeds would be covered over 21,662 hectares, he said and added: commercial crops will cover an area of 1,5,076 hectares.

He also said that 70 per cent of the target for dry land areas will be achieved by May end.

Krishnaiah said there is no dearth of seeds or fertilizers and any shortfall in groundnut seeds will be made good by procuring the same from Dharwar.

6,Mixed response to BJP bandh in Talala,"RAJKOT: The bandh call given by the Bharatiya Janata Party Talala unit to register their protest against the attack on BJP MLA Govindsinh Parmar, evoked mixed response with some shops and establishments remaining closed.

A group of 100-odd BJP workers marched the streets and forced the closure of shops. The police said the shopkeepers were scared as the Congress workers were also keeping a watch. Fearing them many shopkeepers did not down the shutters.

Following tension, the police intensified vigil and deployed more men, the police said adding the BJP men were forcing shopkeepers to close shops.

However, the response was barely 30 per cent. The police have raided several premises of Jasu Barad and looked for the arms following complainant Govind Parmarâ€™s allegation.

The police did not find anything at Barad''s residence. Barad and seven others were absconding after the incident.

A senior police officer traced the feud to the 2002 state assembly election when Barad lost to Parmar by a slim margin.
