0,House may pass Bill for law university,"GANDHINAGAR: The long cherished dream of the state''s legal fraternity for a law university may soon become a reality with the state legislative Assembly expected to pass a Bill on the proposed National University of Legal Education & Research (NULER), similar to the ones existing in Kolkata and Bangalore.

West Bengal National University of Judicial Sciences vice-chancellor N R Madhava Menon has agreed to help Gujarat in starting a university of law and justice which will offer under-graduate to doctorate level courses. The university is expected to have its headquarters in the state capital here.

Sources said that the state government has sanctioned Rs 10 crore for the proposed university, which is expected to start functioning from July. Consultations are on with teachers of various law colleges and other legal luminaries on the proposed university.

NULER will be set up in accordance with the recommendations of a parliamentary committee, which had said that every state should have a national law school like the one in Bangalore, and sponsored by the Bar Council of India to provide a thrust to legal education.

""The decision was taken to answer the challenges thrown by technological developments in this new millennium. And for this, the need to have professional legal education courses based on multi-disciplinary understanding has arisen,"" a senior official told TNN.

The proposed university will offer special courses on education, alternate dispute resolution, environmental laws, law and economics, human rights, jurisprudence, human resource development, world trade laws, capital and investment market laws, consumer protection, banking and financial institutions, maritime and shipping laws, corporate taxation, infrastructure, corporate governance and ethics, management studies, and women and child studies, among others.

The proposed university will initially have seven schools â€” School of Public Law & Policy Science, School of International Legal Studies, School of Criminal Law, Criminology & Forensic Science, School of Business Legal Studies, School of Social Sciences and School of Science Studies.

The setting up of the university will be part of the BJP regime''s ''Gyan Shakti'' policy. It has already given a deemed-university status to the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Communication & Information Technology. Nirma Institute of Technology too is likely to be given a similar status soon.

The Dhirubhai Ambani Education Foundation is planning to set up a new science and technology university in Jamnagar for which a legislative Bill is expected to be passed during the current session of the state Assembly.

The Assembly has already passed the Kutch University Bill and another for renaming Patan-headquartered North Gujarat University as Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University.

1,Misal incident may trigger political storm,"PUNE: The attempt on the life of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Satish Misal is set to trigger a political controversy, with BJP vice president Gopinath Munde accusing the Pune police and state home ministry of not providing enough protection to the elected members from opposition parties.

""Pune is turning into a centre of organised crime. There is an urgent need to form a special squad to wipe out these criminals,"" the former deputy chief minister told reporters here on Saturday. He said the BJP would grill the government in the forthcoming assembly session for its failure to maintain law and order.

Munde, who is touring western Maharashtra as part of the BJP''s Sangharsha Yatra, called on Misal at Poona Hospital on Saturday afternoon. A group of unidentified assailants fired six bullets at Misal at the Abhinav college chowk on Friday evening.

""Doctors have told me that Misal has been successfully operated upon but will have to be kept under observation for another 48 hours,"" Munde said.

Claiming that around eight months ago, Misal had lodged a complaint with the police that he was receiving threatening calls, Munde said, despite this, the police did not provide him protection. The police had even recorded phone calls of miscreants threatening Misal, he said.

He said even his security had been curtailed and added, ""I will not say the government''s acts are deliberate, but they are definitely unjust.""

""What is happening in Pune? A few months ago, son of Subhash Lodha was kidnapped. Then there were cases of kidnapping of a citybased builder and an industrialist. A girl was raped on the university campus,"" Munde said, adding that these instances clearly indicated that Pune was turning into a centre of organised crime.

2,Left intellectuals protest power tariff,"KOLKATA: After the Opposition SUCI, it was the turn of ruling Left Front partner CPI to come out in protest against the hike in electricity tariff by the CESC.

On Sunday, the party took initiative to mobilise prominent Leftist intellectuals of the state to address the press on the issue and release a statement.

The statement is signed by 61 writers, poets, artists and performers, including, significantly, former state finance minister Asok Mitra and present state water resources minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya. The first signature is that of legendary Communist Parliamentarian Hiren Mukherjee.

""We have been marching together with the Left Front for so many decades. But it does not mean that we would support all actions of this government. We hear that West Bengal is the first among the states in many respects. Does it also have to be the first in enhancing the burden of power tariff to facilitate capitalists?"" asked veteran stage personality Tapas Sen.

Both Sen and dramatist Bibhas Chakraborty made it clear that they were not protesting the electricity charges because it would increase their bills.

""For quite some time,"" said Chakraborty, ""the government has been tak-ing various steps which no conscientious person can approve. It has evicted hawkers and poor canalside settlers without rehabilitation in the name of development of the city. It has increased hospital charges. The power issue is only the latest in the line.""

Poet Amitabha Dasgupta said that the intellectuals were prepared to come down to the streets if the government did not pay heed to their appeal.

""However, we still hope that a Left government will rectify its mistake before such a step is taken.""

3,"Heroin seized in Kishanganj, two arrested","KISHANGANJ: Customs as well as the district police were literally caught off their guard when a team of Directorate of Revenue (Intelligence) descended here from Muzaffarpur and startlingly made a big haul of 800 gm of heroin worth over Rs 8 lakh and nabbed two couriers near the bus terminal on Wednesday evening, sources said.

DR (intelligence) sleuths, working on confidential clues, intercepted the two couriers who had smartly smuggled two small packets on their bodies and confiscated the contraband narcotics. Interestingly, these sleuths did not take into confidence either the customs officials or the police. And soon after the seizures, the DR (intelligence) sleuths rather â€œdisappearedâ€� and went back to Muzaffarpur.

Oddly, this was not the first time such things had taken place. In the past, two, DR (intelligence) sleuths had resorted to such modus operandi. And, they had made similar seizures.

DR (Intelligence)â€™s recent confiscation, like in the past, besides catching the ever-so-alert customs officials as well as the police unaware, also drives a nail into the loud claims that everything was hunky-dory in the border district, sandwiched by Nepal and Bangladesh. Rather because of its unique geo-political situation and being on the chickenâ€™s neck between sensitive the north-east and the rest of the country, trans-border crimes and trafficking of narcotics and contraband foreign goods are a grim truth.

Seizures made by the customs officials or the police are no better than the tip of the ice-berg, say confidential sources.

Smugglers and traffickers are known to make use of both the rail and road routes. The various syndicates of the kingpins of the underworld are also known to have their key players at Kishanganj, who, besides giving the necessary feedback to the masterminds, greatly facilitate the passage of such contraband through this conduit, sources say.

5,Railways bid to help farmers,"PATNA: Union railway minister Nitish Kumar wants farmers of the state to sell their vegetables and fruits in metro cities like Delhi and other states. He said that refrigerated bogie facilities, which he had already announced in the railway budget, would enable farmers of the state to export their vegetables, which is grown in a big way in Bihar.

The minister was speaking at Bankaghat railway station after inaugurating water, shades and bench facilities at the station. The station was given a new look with availability of two water tapes, canteen, shades and proper cleaning facilities.

â€œThe current year, which is 150th year of the Indian Railways, is being celebrated as â€œYatri Suvidha Varshâ€� and our aim is to provide better facilities to railway service users,â€� the minister said, adding that the facilities at the Bankaghat is a part of that mission.

Later, he pointed out that a refrigerated bogie will be added to Saptkranti Express, which runs between Muzaffarpur and New Delhi, to enable farmers of the area to export their lichis. He said that Muzaffarpur is famous for its lichis and will certainly give farmers a new market.

Besides, he said that a bogie from Patna would also be attached to any train. He left it to Union small industries minister C P Thakur and BJP state president Nand Kishore Yadav to decide the train to which the bogie could be attached.

Yadav, who is also a local MLA, urged the minister to give some more facilities to the station, which includes a footbridge at the station and stoppage of Patna-Tata Express, Janata Express, Patna-Rajgir Express and Kamla City Express. The minister asked the railway authorities on the spot to do the needful in this connection.

Thakur, speaking on the occasion, said that Nitish was just reminding the people about the possibilities of development in the state. He said that much has been done to improve the railway service in the state. Railway Board (electrical) member S C Gupta was also present.

Speaking to mediapersons, the railway minister termed the criticism by the opposition parties that the railway budget was prepared with an eye on the next general elections as â€œout of context and ridiculousâ€�.

He said that the NDA government would present one more budget before going to polls in 2004. â€œWhy shall I start making preparations for the polls from now?â€�

He assailed the opposition for criticising a â€œpro-people and growth-orientedâ€� railway budget.

Numerating various features of the budget, the minister promised to fill 20,000 vacancies in one year to plug the gap present in the railways at present.

6,"Forget past, Laloo tells Bhumihars at rally","PATNA: RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav on Sunday made an attempt to lure people of Bhumihar caste, a section that has been hostile to his regime for the last 12 years, at a rally organised by RJD minister Akhilesh Singh at Gandhi Maidan here.

Laloo concluded it with a couplet from a popular Hindi song â€” Chhoro kal ki batein, kal ki baat purani, chalo rachein ek naee kahani .

The rally, called â€˜Brahmarshi Kisan Swabhiman Rallyâ€™, had a moderate turn-out. They had come in buses and light vehicles from adjoining areas. Organised as part of the birth anniversary celebration of prominent peasant leader of the pre-Independence period Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, it witnessed NDA-bashing as various speakers accused the NDA of using people of the Brahmarshi Samaj on â€œuse and throw basisâ€�.

Laloo alleged that false and fabricated statements were attributed to him and then published to portray him as â€œanti-Bhumiharâ€�. â€œThough my commitment has been to uplifting downtrodden sections, I have never been anti upper caste,â€� he claimed, and took credit for the reinduction of Dr C P Thakur in the Union ministry.

â€œBut he has been made minister for North East. Sar Uttar Mein, Panw Pashchim Mein,â€� he remarked, and said another minister Nikhil Chouhdary was ousted. â€œI am a straight person,â€� he said, and expressed satisfaction that people of Bhumihar caste had slighted from the â€œNDA train to come to Gandhi Maidanâ€�.

He appealed to the rallyists to be considerate towards weaker sections. â€œI have been fighting Naxalism,â€� he said, and promised to rechristen Wheeler Senate Hall of Patna University after late Sir Ganesh Datt and also instal a lifesize statue of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati in Patna. â€œThe BJP should have installed his portrait in Parliament, and not of one whose name is associated with the killing of Gandhi,â€� he said.

The rallyâ€™s organiser Singh claimed that Laloo had never been â€œanti-Bhumiharâ€� and cited elevation of D P Ojha as the stateâ€™s DGP and Bhola Prasad Singh as deputy speaker of the state assembly in this regard.

7,No threat to govt: Marandi,"JAMSHEDPUR: Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi here on Sunday denied â€œthreatâ€� to his government and exuded confidence that differences with the five rebel ministers would be ironed out in the next couple of days.

The chief minister, who returned from New Delhi on Saturday evening after briefing the BJP leadership about political situation in the state, announced here on Sunday afternoon that he enjoyed the support of NDA constituents. He was talking to mediapersons before addressing a party meeting here. â€œSamata leader Nitish Kumar will be talking to the ministers to resolve the issue. I have also spoken to George Fernandes,â€� Marandi said, adding, â€œI have the backing of both the leaders.â€�The four rebel Samata ministers â€” Bachcha Singh (urban development), Jaleshwar Mahato (PHED), Ramesh Singh Munda (excise) and Madhu Singh (revenue) â€” are to leave for New Delhi to meet Kumar on Monday.

The four Samata ministers along with energy minister Lal Chand Mahato of Janata Dal (United) have raised the banner of revolt and demanded the ouster of Marandi. â€œWe are hopeful that the problem will be sorted out in the next three-four days. Big families sometimes face problems.â€�

I have always been ready to talk to the ministers and participate in the meeting to solve the problems,â€� Marandi declared. Kumar is for the second time playing peacemaker to bail out the ragtag Marandi government in a little over two-year span.

A confident Marandi categorically ruled out the possibility of mid-term polls in the state. He also rubbished reports that a section BJP leaders were extending tacit support to the rebels.

The chief minister, however, refused to comment on the demands of the rebels. â€œI never asked for the chief ministerâ€™s post.

The MLAs and party leaders chose me for the job. I continue to enjoy their love and support,â€� he maintained. Marandi also denied JMM president Shibu Sorenâ€™s charge that the BJP was trying to buy out JMM MLAs for Rs 1 crore each. â€œ

Asked by a correspondent about French Foreign Minister''s statement that ""the US strategy on Iraq is sliding from disarmament towards remodelling of the Middle East,"" Powell on Sunday said ""I disagree categorically with my colleague Dominique de Villepin''s comment.""

""(The Security Council resolution) 1441, which we are trying to implement, had one goal, and that was to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. France voted for the resolution, as did the United States of America,"" Powell said.

He said if Iraq had disarmed itself over the past 12 years or the last several months since resolution 1441 was enacted, ""we would not be facing the crisis that we now have before us.""

""I must say, however, that if we are unable to get Iraq to comply, and military action is necessary to remove this regime and to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction, it is quite clear to me that a new regime would be more responsive to the needs of its people, would live in peace with its neighbours, and perhaps that would assist the region in finding more peace.""

""But the suggestion that we are doing this because we want to go to every country in the Middle East and rearrange all of its pieces is not correct, and I think Minister de Villepin is wrong,"" Powell asserted.

10,NCP stakes claim to form govt in Meghalaya,"SHILLONG: In a new political twist, the NCP legislature party leader E D Marak on Monday staked claim to form the government in Meghalaya.

Marak, who was elected leader of NCP legislature party late last night, accompanied by NCP state unit president Robert Kharsiing met Governor M M Jacob and staked the claim.

Marak did not comment when asked about the number of MLAs supporting him and the parties they belong to.

NCP had bagged the second largest number of 14 out of 60 seats in the February 26 state assembly elections in Nagaland which threw up a fractured verdict.

Congress Legislature Party leader D D Lapang had already submitted a list of 38 MLAs to the governor on Sunday night and staked claim to form the government.

Jacob will inform Lapang about his decision on the government formation later today.

Congress, which has clinched 22 seats in the polls, has submitted a list claiming the support of UDP (9), MDP (4) and Independents (3).

Khun Hyniewtrep National Awkening Movement, which has won two seats, also decided to join the Congress combine at a meeting late on Sunday night.

11,Marandi fails to convince rebels,"RANCHI: With the rebels refusing to relent, Jharkhand Chief Minister Babulal Marandi on Sunday night paid a surprise visit to the residences of two dissident ministers but failed to convince them.

When contacted, one of the dissident ministers Lalchand Mahato of JD-U said ""the chief minister requested us to pardon him and solve the matter amicably...We said we have nothing against him (Marandi). We are going to New Delhi for talks as he had slammed the doors on our face.""

Two other rebels -- Madhu Singh and Jaleshwar Mahato -- were present at Mahato''s house when the chief minister dropped in.

BJP sources confirmed that the chief minister, accompanied by Mines and Geology minister Ravindra Rai, had visited dissident minister Bachcha Singh''s house, apart from Lalchand Mahato''s residence.

The rebels, who on February 20 raised the banner of revolt, are scheduled to visit the national capital this afternoon to meet Samata leaders George Fernandes, Nitish Kumar and Janata Dal (united) president Sharad Yadav.

On February 20, Madhu Singh, Bachcha Singh, Ramesh Singh Munda, Jaleswar Mahato (all Samata), besides Lalchand Mahato, revolted demanding removal of Babulal Marandi for alleged non-compliance with the rules of executive business and cabinet''s nod during transfer posting of class-one officers.

Lalchand Mahato had yesterday asked the NDA leadership to replace Chief minister Babulal Marandi if it did not want ""a repeat of Himachal debacle in Jharkhand"".

""The Central NDA leadership should soon act on our genuine demand to replace Marandi with any other leader as Chief minister,"" Lalchand Mahato, who is the Energy minister, said.

Marandi, who met senior party leaders in New Delhi on Friday last came back with an assurance that the BJP central leadership was strongly behind him.

Meanwhile, Lalchand got a shot in the arm when his state unit chief Goutam Sagar Rana contrary to his earlier stand announced on Saturday that the party''s state unit was with the five ministers in their demand for Marandi''s ouster.

Asked whether the rebels, who are flying to New Delhi, would accept the directions of their respective Central leaderships, Mahato said ""other than the people of Jharkhand, nobody can direct us what to do and what not to"".

""How long shall we support Marandi with our eyes closed. In the two years of rule, corruption, extremism and unemployment have increased manifold... The need of the hour was to embark on ''greater village'' projects rather than greater Ranchi project,"" Mahato said and added ""it is true that we are going to Delhi, but not to break our vow to replace Marandi.""

12,Naga political issue top priority of DAN: Rio,"KOHIMA: Resolving the Naga political issue would be the top priority of Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) in the event of the four-party conglomeration coming to power in the state, Neiphiu Rio, who was elected leader of the Nagaland People''s Front (NPF) legislature party, said on Monday.

An honourable solution to the Naga political problem besides rebuilding the state on the socio- economic front would be high on DAN''s agenda if it came to power, Rio told reporters shortly after his election as legilsature party leader.

The name of Rio, former home minister in the S C Jamir Cabinet and the main force behind the formation of DAN, was proposed by newly elected MLA and former state chief secretary Z Obed and seconded by new legislator Noke Konyak, NPF sources said.

Dan, a conglomeration of NPF, BJP, Samata and JD(U), has won 29 seats in the February 26 assembly election and received support from four Independents.

Claiming that DAN could provide a stable regime in Nagaland, he described the just concluded elections as a mandate of the Naga people against the ''autocratic rule'' of Congress chief minister S C Jamir in the past 10 years.

Rio along with Therie, power minister in the Jamir Cabinet, had spearheaded the anti-Congress campaign in the run-up to the polls dubbing Jamir as the main stumbling block in the way of Naga peace.

The NPF legislature party meeting was chaired by its president and former chief minister Vizol.

In all likelihood, Rio might be elected leader of DAN by Monday evening or Tuesday as the BJP legislature party meeting at Dimapur, after the first sitting, has been postponed until the evening.

The BJP leaders would have to come over to Kohima to attend the meeting of DAN constituents to elect its leader.

DAN sources told PTI that if the BJP meeting at Dimapur was delayed, the alliance meeting might be postponed till Tuesday.

13,D D Lapang to head Meghalaya govt,"NEW DELHI: A Congress-led coalition ministry headed by D D Lapang is likely to be sworn in in Meghalaya on Tuesday while a Democratic Alliance of Nagaland government is set to be installed in Kohima on Tuesday even as the issue of Congress chief ministership in Himachal Pradesh remained unsettled.

With reports indicating that former chief minister Virbhadra Singh could be a front runner for the top post in Shimla, possible contender and PCC president Vidya Stokes on Monday met Congress president Sonia Gandhi here apparently forwarding her claim.

Later, when reporters asked if she could be the first woman chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, Stokes said ""why not?""

The Congress Legislature Party is meeting in Shimla on Tuesday to elect its leader.

In Shillong, Lapang was elected leader of the combined legislature party of Congress, with 22 MLAs, and its allies United Democratic Party (9 MLAs) and Meghalaya Democratic Party (4) and three independents which together add up to a strength of 38 in the 60-member state Assembly.

Lapang had on Sunday met Meghalaya Governor M M Jacob and staked claim to form the government submitting a list of 38 MLAs in his support.

Raj Bhawan sources said that Lapang was likely to be invited to form government on Tuesday.

Earlier, a new twist was given to the ministry-making scene in Meghalaya when NCP, which emerged as the second largest party with 14 seats, met the Governor on Monday morning and staked claim to form the government but failed to muster the required number to buttress it by the deadline of 4 pm.

14,2 more bottled water units including Bisleri shut,"NEW DELHI: Tightening the noose on errant bottled and packaged drinking water companies, the government on Monday cancelled ISI quality licences of two more units including that of Bisleri International, Noida.

This takes the number of plants facing such action to 11 in less than a month as earlier inspections by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) had led to action against eight plants including one each of PepsiCo, Bisleri and Ion-Exchange while a unit of Coca Cola was let off with a warning.

""ISI quality mark has been withdrawn from the bottled water plant of Bisleri International, Noida and Sri Agencies, Secunderabad after inspection revealed their samples are not up to the existing standards,"" BIS said.

Licence withdrawal or cancellation of a unit automatically debars it from manufacturing bottled water since ISI Standard Mark is mandatory under government rules.

This is the second Bisleri licence to be withdrawn after similar action against its Bangalore plant last month.

Action is part of an ongoing nationwide exercise under the directive of Consumer Affairs Minister Sharad Yadav and would continue in the coming days, they said adding more licence cancellations are in the offing.

BIS sources said far from adhering to the proposed revised quality norms, a number of bottled water plants are unable to meet even the existing BIS standards forcing the Bureau to take stringent action against them.

Yadav has asserted in Parliament that the government is determined to ensure fullest long term protection to public health.

Sources expressed concern that the samples drawn both from factory and market of bottled water manufactured by Sri Agencies, Secunderabad contained aerobic microbal plate count, escherichia coli and coliform bacteria which can prove critical for public health.

""There has been consecutive failure of sample drawn from factory and market in February of critical requirements,"" sources said.

Bisleri has also been asked to stop using ISI mark with immediate effect on ""failure of sample in independent testing"", they said adding the licence was orginally valid upto May 15 this year.

From now onwards Bisleri''s Noida unit will not be permitted to mark and despatch the product with the Standard Mark, they said.

Both companies have been asked to ensure stoppage of marking over the product with immediate effect.

It has also been asked to furnish details relating to the quantity of ISI marked material held in stock, type of grade, variety and brand.

In addition the batch number and date of manufacture and packing have also to be provided to the Government along with pending orders for BIS certified material and purchasers names and addresses.

In case the information is not received within 15 days it will be assumed that the companies do not have such material. If they are subsequently found to be selling such material it will be construed that the material so sold has been ''marked'' later. BIS will then reserve right to take action against misuse of the ISI Mark.

15,Loan recovery: Punjab farmers lay to siege to bank,"BATHINDA/TALWANDI SABO: Employees of primary agriculture development and land mortgage banks here are in a cleft stick over the issue of recovery of loans from farmers.

And, on Monday, they got a taste of the farmers'' ire, when hundreds of them under the aegis of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) laid siege to the Talwandi Sabo branch of the bank. Talwandi Sabo MLA Jeet Mohinder Singh, too, participated in the protest against the harassment and arrest of farmers by bank employees to effect loan recovery.

Raising slogans against the bank employees, the BKU leaders alleged that despite an assertion by the Punjab chief minister in January this year (during Maghi Mela) that no farmer would be handcuffed or his land auctioned for recovery of loan, the latter were being arrested and their land auctioned.

Speaking at the dharna in front of the Land Mortgage Bank, Jeet Mohinder Singh, alleged that the bank staff misbehaved with the farmers, who were already living under great uncertainty due to crippling debts. He was accompanied by Gurtej Singh Jodhpur, an SGPC member and other leaders of the area.

President of state BKU Joginder Singh Ugrahan alleged that the state government had forgotten its election promises, and a dharna would be staged in front of his residence at Patiala from March 22-25, to jog his memory.

The BKU leaders also expressed solidarity with the agitating employees of Punjab State Electricity Board, and announced that they would participate in the employees'' rally at Patiala on March 22.

Jeet Mohinder questioned the use of different yardsticks for farmers and big industrial houses. He said that while the banks were making a one time settlement and waiving loans of big industrial houses, the farmers were being pressurised, even when they were in no condition to repay their loans due to successive failure of crops.

16,Use Pota on post-Godhra rioters too: Amarsinh,"GANDHINAGAR: The Congress on Monday demanded that Prevention of Terrorist Act (Pota) be imposed on the post-Godhra riot accused.

Making a statement in the state Assembly on Monday, leader of Opposition Amarsinh Chaudhary asked, ""If Pota can be imposed on the Godhra accused, were the crimes committed in the riots any less gruesome? Innocent people were burnt alive. Why has Pota not been imposed on them?""

Replying to a motion of thanks moved by senior BJP MLA Bharat Barot on Governor S S Bhandari''s address to the assembly last week, Chaudhary said, ""Is Pota meant only for criminals of one religion? How can the law be applied in a discriminatory fashion?""

Terming BJP''s ""cultural nationalism"" as ""communal nationalism"", he called the post-Godhra riots ""government-sponsored."" Defending the government''s decision to impose Pota on the Godhra accused alone, state law minister Ashok Bhatt told the House that it is used ""only against those who are involved in terrorist and anti-national activities."" Bhatt said,

""Amarsinh is desperate. That is why he is trying to defend the Godhra accused by coming up with such statements."" He insisted, ""If there were any state-sponsored riots, they were in early 1980s. Then, chief minister Madhavsinh Solanki and Amarsinh Chaudhary as state home minister fought with each other, and in the struggle for power created a riotous situation.""

Pointing out that ""Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s Hindutva, projected as ''Moditva'' in the country is falling apart, as apparent from the Himachal Pradesh poll results, Chaudhary said, ""Those who voted for the BJP are also beginning to see how hollow the CM''s plank was.""

Swaminarayan sect ''sadhus'' and ''sadhvis'' of Vadtal have been on dharna for the last several days in Gandhinagar. They relate horrendous tales of how police beat up the ''sadhvis'' mercilessly.

""Why can''t the state charity commissioner, under whom falls the Vadtal dispute over the temple seat, resolve the issue?"", Chaudhary sought to know.

Accusing the BJP of adopting the policy of victimising those who had not voted for the party during the last assembly polls, Chaudhary referred to the plight of the Rampara Dalits belonging to the Dhandhuka constituency in Ahmedabad district, who fled the village after an attack on them.

Participating in the debate, Babu Meghji Shah, senior Congress MLA from Kutch, said the government was too lethargic to spend the money it had received for quake rehabilitation.

""So far, the state has received Rs 3,746 crore,"" Shah told the assembly. ""Of this, it has spent Rs 1,640 crore, of which only Rs 842 crore were spent in Kutch.""

Accusing the state of neglecting the drought-affected, Shah said, ""If your water supply schemes were successful after spending Rs 1,000 crore for laying down pipelines, what was the need to chalk out a Rs 240 crore master plan to supply water by tankers? Already, 2,400 villages are being supplied water by tanker. The figure two years ago was 1,400 villages.""

17,Post-Budget: Time for farmers to observe 'crop holiday',"LUDHIANA: With the union budget giving cold shoulder to agricultural sector, the hapless farming community''s desperation found expression in extreme terms like observing crop holiday for the next rabi and kharif seasons. It may sound unreal but the fact remains that over the years their plight did not seem to be anybody''s concern.

The recent hike in vital inputs of fertilisers and diesel on which the farmers had to incur unprecedented expenses to maintain yield as witnessed during recent drought conditions only goes to show the extent of insensitivity of the powers that be towards them.

The common refrain of rolling back price hike of these inputs is, interestingly, emanating from both ends of the spectrum that is marginal and so-called prosperous farmers alike. And equally vociferous in criticising the government treatment to the farm sector are the experts on agricultural economy.

Punjab Young Farmers Association president Kanwaljit Singh Sidhu suggested that the time has come for the farmers across the spectrum to go in for crop holiday to impress upon the government and policy makers to see reason. Instead of offering fertiliser subsidy directly to the farmers, which is pocketed by manufacturers, the government had already effected freeze on minimum support price for both wheat and paddy, Sidhu pointed out.

The experience of small farmers like Ranjit Singh, from Lalton Village near here is no different but in absence of government support he acted decisively by not renewing farming contract on 40 acre land belonging to a former Punjab minister. The reason being per acre hike in contract money from Rs 10,000 to 13,000 which he worked out would lead to penury coupled with increased financial liability by way of jacked up input costs.

Making out a case for alternative ways and means to get the farm sector out of red, Sidhu cited the example of Taiwan where he had been to some time back. As per Taiwanese model of dealing with agricultural management, Sidhu informed that faced with glut situation in rice production the country had to import sweet maize from the US.

Asking their farmers not to grow rice, the government assured them to provide 1.5 tonne per hectare rice in lieu of this. Within two years the maize production became so much that no import was required, he said while trying to bring home point that innovative solutions are required to elevate the Indian agriculture.

But the government lacks the will and future seems bleak for about 80 per cent of the population engaged in this sector, Sidhu said and added that if the government persisted with present policy who would not think of crop holiday.

18,CTP likely to attract record investment,"CHANDIGARH: The city''s ambitious Chandigarh Technology Park (CTP) project will attract an investment of Rs 750 crore to Rs 1,000 crore in the next three to five years, as number of software companies, including foreign firms and those belonging to nonresident Indians (NRIs), are vying for investment here.

This will likely be the biggest ever investment for any project in the city ever since it was constructed over five decades ago.

Officials say that besides leading Indian software companies showing interest, foreign and NRI firms are also keen to invest. At least three US-based NRI software companies and a British firm have taken up space at the IT department''s incubation centre on Punjab Engineering College (PEC) campus, taking the number of companies here upto seven now.

Three new companies at the centre include Outsourcing Unlimited, a NRI venture from US, Bebo and another US-firm Safaltek. Four companies, Global Back office, a British firm, Net Solutions, SE-Asia and Image Computers, are already associated with the incubation centre. Sources say that the companies are likely to expand its investment in the CTP.

With the UT Administration all set for the CTP''s foundation stone at the end of this month and software giant Infosys submitting its plans to start construction on its 20-acre campus in April, officials say that the CTP is poised for major activity.

Infosys alone has committed to invest Rs 100 crore in the next five years, with Rs 30 crore to be invested in the next one year in its first phase.

Sources say that Infosys is likely to have a competition amongst country''s top-rung architects to design its campus, which is planned to be even more modern than its establishments in Bangalore and Hyderabad. Last month, planners from the firm of leading architect Hafeez Contractor met UT Administration officials to discuss plans.

Director-IT Vivek Atray says that a number of software companies are expected to commit investment in the CTP shortly once the project gets started.

19,Disabled wait in vain for govt's job crutch,"PUNE: It warmed the cockles of the heart when the Maharashtra government, in 1998, became one of the first states in the country to undertake an elaborate process of identifying jobs for people with disabilities.

The government was heeding the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act 1995, which directed state governments to reserve three per cent jobs for the disabled. Five years down the line, however, the promised jobs remain only on paper!

Just how dismal the situation is can be gauged from the fact that of the 3,349 persons with disabilities who registered with the Pune district employment and self-employment guidance centre at Rasta Peth, only 52 secured jobs in 2001. The figures for 2002 and 2003 were not available with the centre.

In fact, the Pune-based office of the commissioner for persons with disabilities does not have the exact number of jobs given by the government to persons with disabilities in the state. The commissioner, Sanjay Chahande, admitted to this correspondent that the government had failed to fill the three per cent job reservations.

Chahande said that though Maharashtra was among the first states to start the process of identifying these jobs, most government departments, instead of locating such jobs, drew up long lists of jobs that the physically-challenged could not do! However, after the Union government drew up a list of detailed guidelines for choosing such jobs, the state government has set up its own expert committee to study the issue.

""I have now instructed all divisional commissioners to provide me with the list of such jobs,"" he said. But there are still hurdles aplenty.

Chahande points to the state government''s ongoing freeze on all fresh recruitment, including the physically-challenged. However, he hopes that the government considers the possibility of recruiting the physically-challenged from among the scheduled castes and tribes, for whom the recruitment process has recently been opened.

W.N. Tungar, founder, Apang Sahayakari Sanstha (ASS), a Punebased NGO working for persons with disabilities, lambasts the state government for its inaction.

""We have 40-lakh physically-challenged people in the state, most of whom are dependent on their families. The government must at least recruit such people for the class III and IV posts like sweepers, peons and liftmen immediately,"" he said.

(This is the first part in a twopart series on employment for the physically-challenged.)

20,"Trinamul, BJP seat-sharing for rural polls to be finalised soon","KOLKATA: The Trinamul Congress would soon hold a meeting with the West Bengal unit of the BJP to finalise seat-sharing for the ensuing panchayat elections, declared party chief Mamata Banerjee on Friday.

She also mooted the idea of an alternative front comprising the Trinamul, BJP and smaller parties to take on the ruling Left Front at the polls. She refused to spell out which smaller parties she had in mind though. â€œWe will float an alternative front to counter the ruling Left Front. Trinamul Congress and BJP will be the two major constituents, but smaller parties are welcome, too,â€� Mamata said.

Welcoming the Trinamulâ€™s call, state BJP president Tathagata Roy said the meeting could take place next week. After touring several north Bengal districts, Roy also criticised state agriculture minister and Forward Bloc leader Kamal Guha for his â€œconsistent instigationâ€� of the people living along the border against the BSF.

â€œGuha alleges that the BSF is harassing common people in the border areas. He is also against the erection of barbed fences on the border,â€� said Roy. â€œBut I found that the people are happy with the way BSF is checking illegal immigration. They are also happy with the fences. I donâ€™t know whose interests Guha is serving,â€� he wondered.

21,Natwar lauds govt stance on war,"PUNE: Former foreign secretary and senior Congress leader Natwar Singh on Sunday praised the stand taken by the government on the issue of war on Iraq by the US, and warned that if the world remains a mute spectator to America''s strong-arm tactics, it would be the turn of another country next.

Singh was speaking at a function organised by the Kakasheb Gadgil Pratishthan, held to observe the 75th birth anniversary of Congress leader Vitthalrao Gadgil, at the S.M. Joshi Foundation hall.

Singh said, ""The government has taken the correct stand of opposing any unilateral action by America and it should stick to this stand and all political parties, keeping aside differences, should support the government on the issue"".

""It is not only the question of India supporting Iraq, other countries should also oppose the US'' designs vociferously as it could be the turn of some other country to face its wrath"". It is the prerogative of the people of Iraq to decide who should be their leader and not of the US president, George W. Bush, he added.

Pointing out to US'' double standards, Singh said, ""The UN weapons inspectors had not found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but still the US wants to attack Iraq. On the other hand, North Korea, which is openly admitting that it has not only nuclear weapons, but also inter-continental ballistic missiles, the US is turning a blind eye to it"". This clearly indicates that America is interested in Iraq''s oil rather than punishing the nation for its weapons, he added.

Speaking on the occasion, Bombay high court judge justice Dilip Bhosale said, ""Inadequate number of judges was a major reason behind the large volume of pending cases in the courts"".

""In 1980, the number of pending cases in the Bombay high court was around 60,000 and the number of judges was 43. In two decades, the number of pending cases had reached the 3-lakh mark, while the number of judges had increased only by nine.""

""I don''t want to compare the workload of Indian judges with those in developed countries, but Indian judges have at least three to four times more work than that of judges in developed countries.

Suggesting an alternative, he said, ""Time khad come when the litigant parties appoint arbitrators and settle their cases outside courts with the courts playing a pro-active role in encouraging the litigants to use alternative dispute resolution systems"".

22,Putatunda enters N Bengal politics with HMS,"SILIGURI: Secretary of the Party for Democratic Socialism Samir Putatunda seems to have chosen the tea gardens for his baptism into north Bengal politics.

To begin with, PDS has joined hands with the Hind Mazdoor Sabha and demanded full inquiry into the recent police firing at Chengmari Tea Estate that claimed the lives of three labourers lives and injured 16 policemen. After visiting the garden with HMSâ€™ state council general secretary S. Roy, Putatunda told the press in Siliguri, â€œWe demand immediate arrest of the culprits. Along with HMS, we are trying to help the suffering labourers.â€�

PDS is using HMS support base in tea gardens to gain a toehold in north Bengal, claimed observers. Until now, the PDS had failed to make its presence felt in the region. According to police sources, in a clash at the Chengmari garden on February 24, three persons died in police firing while at least 50 people including 16 policemen were injured. The CPM described this as police action against two criminal gangs.

An injured Kisan Murmu told TNN at Siliguri Medical College that the two groups representing two CPM factions had clashed earlier too over fund collection and commission from labour wages of the garden.

â€œThe local panchayat and party leaders never seriously tried to stop the tussle,â€� claimed Murmu.
