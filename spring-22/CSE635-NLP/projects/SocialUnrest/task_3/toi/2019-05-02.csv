1,'Power tariff policy within a month',"DHANBAD: State governments willing to supply power at a subsidised rate to the public will have to make budgetary provisions to make up for the losses to the respective state electricity boards. Giving this information to mediapersons here, Union energy minister Suresh P Prabhu said that the Union government is likely to announce a transparent regulation and tariff policy within a month.He was here on a two-day visit to DVC, Maithon and was talking to mediapersons at the Maithon DVC guest house on Sunday afternoon.The state electricity boards were losing about Rs 26,000 crore annually as they are being asked to supply power at a rate lower than the actual cost of generation and supply. But this cannot continue for long, he said, adding that the Electricity Regulatory Commission was preparing a tariff policy on the guidelines of the Union government. States willing to supply power at a rate lower than the tariff prescribed will have to make budgetary provisions to make up for the losses of the electricity boards, he said.According to him, all measures to improve the quality of power supplied and to bring a qualitative change in transmission and distribution system were being taken by the government. Power theft was the biggest impediment in proper development of the power projects, he said. Power worth Rs 20,000 crore to 25,000 crore was being pilfered annually. The government has taken this problem seriously and is soon going to adopt technologically advanced equipment to stop the theft of power. Nasscom, a technological consultant, has been asked to devise and install equipment to stop power theft, he informed.The energy minister stated that the government has decided to increase the power generation capacity by 40,000 MW in the 10th five-year plan from the existing level and has set a goal of power to all by 2012. The power generation capacity will have to be increased by 1 lakh MW to meet this goal, he said.He, however, clarified that taking a lesson from the Enron episode, the government would not provide any guarantee to any future power project. The DVC is to increase its generation capacity by 6,000 MW during the Tenth five-year plan and all the villages in the DVC command area would be electrified within two-three years, he said.

3,`Sonia ignored state farmers',"BANGALORE: Former legislator H N Nanje Gowda on Wednesday took exception to Congress president Sonia Gandhi providing relief from party funds to farmers in Andhra Pradesh while ignoring Karnataka.

She had visited Karnataka on the day she distributed foodgrains to drought-affected families in Ananthpur. ``It is surprising the AICC chief ignored Karnataka where her party is ruling and decided to give relief to farmers in another state,'''' he wondered.

The Veeresh committee report on farmers'' suicide was presented to the government the day Sonia visited Karnataka. Ironically, the committee told the government not to provide compensation to farmers, he said.

4,Packaging rehab with development,"AHMEDABAD: Kutch needs a long-term disaster-mitigation and drought-proofing programme and not mere relief and rehabilitation. The British agencies that came to the region after last year''s earthquake have discovered dovetailing relief and rehabilitation with development as the best practice.

As many as 12 of the 14 organisations under the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) have not stopped the relief and rehabilitation exercise after the initial phases. They prolonged their stay to help reduce vulnerability of the region and are planning to continue their work for at least another couple of years.

The umbrella organisation, which collected funds worth 24-million pounds from the Brits for Kutch, has recently come up with a report on ''Best Practices in Gujarat Earthquake Response Programme''. It points out the experience and evolution of the practices the agencies have identified and sets out the standards for humanitarian aids.

""This is indeed a best practice aimed at dovetailing relief with development, a recommendation oft made by the development practitioners. Another hallmark of the approach was the ambition of the agencies to improve,"" the report says.

These agencies, in the earlier phase itself, have realised that the rehabilitation and reconstruction must be seized as an opportunity to transform the underdeveloped region.

""We considered this as an opportunity for long-term disaster mitigation and drought proofing. We are into roof-top water harvesting and training village artisans for its installation, we constructed sub-surface dams, installed ground-water recharge structures and helped setting-up village development committees and village modernisation committees,"" says Usha Mishra-Joshi of Oxfam.

The agencies also learnt that besides being prone to several types of natural disasters - like drought, cyclone, flood and earthquake - the social structure of Kutch was complex with influence of caste system and communal dynamism. The agencies claim that they also focused on addressing issues related to reducing both geographical and socio-economic vulnerabilities.

The response to the earthquake was unique and cannot be compartmentalised as relief and rescue in strict sense, the agencies believed. Installation of water distribution systems and water harvesting structures and supply of fodder to cattle, which happened at the later part of the relief phase, cannot be categorised as activities of relief alone, they say.

The new areas which the agencies are focusing now include institutionalisation of health, water distribution systems and water harvesting structures.

The agencies also exercised caution in imposing alien and inappropriate practices. For disaster preparedness, a Community Disaster Mitigation Fund was set-up and seismic safety features were built in the shelters.

""Initially we did not have primary details and data of the region. It would have been better if we had gathered data... Besides, it would have been good had the donors been told as to what was really needed,"" says Donald Manish Burges of the Worldvision.

Some of the organisations have come up with three-to-four years of strategic development programmes as they want their efforts not to discontinue immediately after they leave. ""Our relations have improved with the government and we have learnt how to work together. After the initial effort, we are now focusing on sustainable development,"" says Randel Leek of Save the Children.

Concerted attempts at mitigating the chronic drought conditions and vulnerability to other natural disasters in this semi-arid region seem to continue for sometime.

5,Fight Modi's misrule: Sonia,"PORBUNDER: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday urged the people of Gujarat to fight the ""injustice and misrule of the central and state governments. ""There is no better place than Gujarat, especially Porbunder, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, to begin the fight,"" she said.

Addressing a largely attended public meeting at the Duleep cricket ground here, she attacked the central and state governments, saying ""if the government decides to end the violence, it could do so. But they were not interested in containing the violence in Gujarat as their eyes were on the elections. The brokers of power were on the rampage and innocent lives were lost.""

Braving the scorching heat, around 50,000 people attended the meeting.

Taking a dig at the rajdharma that the Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Chief Minister Narendra Modi have claimed to be following in Gujarat, she said ""Is this the rajdharma that the prime minister was speaking about? We have learnt our lessons on rajdharma from leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.""

""We do not run our rajdharma on death and destruction. We run the rajdharma on the path of development,"" Sonia said.

She said Gujarat, the most industrialised state in the country, had gone backward due to the inefficiency of the current rulers.

""Those who are against humanity are the enemies of religion. No religion teaches to kill innocent people. The unabated violence in the state is a blot not only on our country but also on our character. Such violence should have no place in our society,"" she said.

She said the Godhra carnage was ""a shame on humanity, but the killings that followed were barbaric.""

Congress general secretary and in-charge of Gujarat affairs Kamal Nath said the evil face of the BJP has been exposed.

Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee president Amarsinh Chaudhary was also present.

6,Look who’s made the Mahatma violent,"AHMEDABAD: It was a red-faced BJP government which stepped into the 43rd birth anniversary of Gujarat.

A glaring mistake in a government advertisement attributed the word â€˜violenceâ€™ in place of â€˜non-violenceâ€™ to Mahatma Gandhi, thereby changing the whole meaning of his message.

The advertisement was released to mark the foundation day of the state and appeared in several local dailies. It has a picture of the Mahatma with folded hands. Along with it is a comment: â€˜â€˜Violence is not a shield to hide cowardice â€” It is the greatest asset of the brave: Mahatma Gandhi.â€™â€™ Effectively, it means the apostle of peace actually advocated violence.

The advertisement should have said: â€˜â€˜Non-violence is not a shield to hide cowardice â€” It is the greatest asset of the braveâ€™â€™.

Thankfully, vernacular dailies used the term ahimsa which conveyed the actual meaning of what the Mahatma had said. The English dailies, however, received calls from angry readers asking whether this was a deliberate act to justify the â€˜â€˜state-sponsored violenceâ€™â€™ in Gujarat.

7,New BA syllabus more succinct,"NEW DELHI: The revision has come after 15 years. The revision process itself extended over six long years. But the new format of the BA (Hons) history syllabus which will be implemented this session, promises to be succinct and has a number of structural changes.

The syllabus was ratified at the Academic Council meeting held recently. The history department is now in the process of reorienting teachers to teach the new syllabus.

Although the number of papers has remained at nine, there have been many structural variations. Take for instance, the paper on â€˜â€˜Social formations and cultural patterns of the ancient and mediaeval worldâ€™â€™. This paper has been shifted from the third year to the first. This explains the patterns in countries other than India. R L Shukla, a history teacher, said this might pose problems for students fresh out of school as the paper is considered tough.

Similarly, the paper on â€˜â€˜History of China and Japanâ€™â€™ has been shifted from third to the first year. The idea behind this is to arrange the different sections chronologically according to the periods, said the head of the history department T K V Subramanian.

For those who want to take up history in college, there are other minor changes as well. A component of mapping has been

introduced in Course 1. â€˜â€˜The idea is to combine historical knowledge with cartography,â€™â€™ Subramanian said. This is in the direction of an inter-disciplinary approach.

The approach towards the subject has undergone a change too. Resource utilisation is linked to economic developments. Students will now be asked questions such as â€˜â€˜Explain temple as an instrument of state policyâ€™â€™, Subramanian added. â€˜â€˜Between the 12th and the 15th century, the wealth donated to a temple was a direct indication of the economic prosperity of a particular section of people,â€™â€™ he said.

He added that till now regional history was being neglected.

Students would opt out of it. This year onwards it has been made compulsory to attempt one

question from each section.

A few history teachers have, however, pointed out that the new syllabus offered sketchy information in many areas. A professor with the department S Chakarvarty said the Indian Nationalist Movement had been marginalised. Hence, a student who studies the new syllabus will not be taught about the formation of the Muslim League, Ghadar movement of Punjab, Home Rule movement of Annie Besant, the Lucknow Pact between the Muslim League and Congress, Simon Commission, Lahore Congress and the concept of purna swaraj, formation of

Congress Socialist Party, Meerut Conspiracy case, round table

conference, among other things,

he claimed.

Chakarvarty also alleged that the â€˜â€˜Imperial Stateâ€™â€™ had been ignored. A history student, he said would know little about personalities such as Dalhousie, Curzon or Hastings and hence lose out on understanding of the colonial power between 1919 and 1947, he added.

He went on to say that the matter under nationalism and social groups was vague. â€˜â€˜There are no names of personalities or organisations leaving teachers completely at sea,â€™â€™ he said.

A handful of teachers have also expressed their dissent with a unit titled â€˜â€˜Communalism: Ideologies and practicesâ€™â€™ where the Hindu Mahasabha, Muslim League, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Akali Dal have been included. â€˜â€˜Most of these organisations

were not communal in nature in the earlier part of the 19th century, another teacher added.

8,Now Nitish censures Gujarat govt,"PATNA: Samata Party leader and railway minister Nitish Kumar has questioned efficiency of the Narendra Modi led BJP government in Gujarat in containing the escalation of communal riots, which has resulted in the killing of a large number of people. He said Samata is â€œnot in favour of the removalâ€� of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi as it is an internal matter of the BJP. â€œThe Samata Party, however, is equally concerned over deteriorating situation in that state,â€� Kumar added. Kumar, who came here on a three-day visit, said the country is passing through a â€œstrange situation of confrontation on frivolous matters at the national level despite the fact that the country is passing through a critical phase because of military build-up on our borders and difficult economic condition.â€� â€œInstead of putting our heads together to face the situation, we are moving in different directions,â€� he added. He expressed pain and anguish over creation of confrontation by AICC president Sonia Gandhi in the country. He, without naming the alliance partners of the NDA, lambasted them for creating confusion to destabilise the Vajpayee government. Kumar blamed Gandhi for creating an atmosphere of confrontation at the national level by making â€œirresponsible statementsâ€�. While addressing a recent meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industries in New Delhi, she, reportedly, said that a huge presence of representatives of trade and commerce was signalling the change of political wind in the country.

9,Higher disability among govt school children,"HYDERABAD: Most of the children studying in government schools, particularly the Balajyothi schools, look normal, but about 11 per cent of them suffer from multiple disabilities.

In a survey conducted in 51 Balajyothi schools, as many as 6,591 children were screened. Of them, 10.76 per cent were found to suffer from distinct physical and psychological problems. The disabilities among the children have been classified as oro facial anomalies (25); ear discharge and aches (183), abnormal voice (131); misarticulation (26); children who stutter (60); delayed speech and language (38) and children found having distinctly different speech and language problem (124). About 50 children were found suffering from low eye vision, mental retardation, cerebral palsy and physical disability including polio.

The Hyderabad district runs as many as 168 Balajyothi schools in which about 22,000 children are enrolled. Mana Centre, a non-governmental organisation working in the area of disabled children, said the volunteers got repeated complaints from the teachers about the childrenâ€™s problems. Following these complaints, Mana Centre had conducted a survey in September and October last year, and it was submitted to Hyderabad district collector in February 2002.

The report sought immediate help from the authorities for the children. â€œMost of the children are in the initial stages of disability who are called â€˜risk childrenâ€™. They need specific interventions to prevent them from becoming permanently disabled,â€� said secretary of Mana Centre, G Ravi Chandra Raju. According to him, the children need special counselling, aural education, and specific temporary aids that help children live on their own among others.

Speaking to The Times of India, district collector Rajeshwar Tiwari said special medical camps were being conducted regularly for the disabled, where irrespective of the age group, all are treated. With regard to special focus on children, the district administration proposes to take specific measures. â€œWe got funds under different literary schemes with which we want to divert our attention to disability among children,â€� said Rajeshwar Tiwari.

12,Probe against polytechnic principal,"JALANDHAR: Action has been initiated against the principal of Government Polytechnic for Women (GPW), Jalandhar, Naresh Nagpal, following complaints of sexual harassment, misappropriation of government funds, forgery and tampering with government records and flouting of appointment rules.

Not only has he been transferred, but an inquiry too has been ordered into complaints by students and parents.

The principal, his son and wife have been in the thick of controversies for the last two years.

According to a complaint sent to the chief minister, during the last two years a student, Shashi Sonia, hung herself to death in the hostel, another student, Vanita, committed suicide, while Mandeep discontinued her studies midway.

Suparna got herself migrated to GPW Patiala following sexual harassment. Nisha Bahti, complaining of sexual harassment at the hands of the principal, got herself migrated to GPW Ludhiana.

Yet another student, Mukti, complained of being â€œphysically torturedâ€� by the principalâ€™s wife for having complained against the principalâ€™s son for having made â€œsexual advancesâ€� towards her. She gave up her studies.

Emboldened by the action taken against the Punjabi University vice-chancellor and Punjab Public Service Commission chairman, Ratan Chand, father of one of the students, has sent the written complaint to the chief minister on behalf of the students and staff of GPW, Jalandhar.

â€œNobody dared to challenge the principal, Naresh Nagpal.We had sent written complaints earlier too, during the Akali Dal-BJP regime, but nothing came out of it. Hoping that this government has initiated action against the corrupt holding offices in high places, we have decided to file a fresh complaint,â€� said Ratan Chand.

Minister for technical education Mohinder Kaypee, when contacted on telephone, said, â€œWe have ordered an inquiry and the principalâ€™s transfer has also been ordered.We have been receiving complaints against him earlier too.â€�

When asked why he is being transferred and why not conduct the inquiry immediately, the minister replied: â€œTransfer does not mean that the inquiry will be effected. It will go on.â€�

The principal, Naresh Nagpal, said â€œAn inquiry had been ordered into all the allegations by the department in August 2001. In Nishaâ€™s case, her lectures had been short by 67 and we did not allow her to sit for the exam. She then applied for migration but the board refused it on technical grounds. A group of staff members have been creating mischief.As for the suicide by a student, it had been found that it was a case of depression.â€�

The written complaint says that the principal is â€œspending government funds and grants plus students common funds for purchasing things required for the leisure of his family members... he has been purchasing things in the name of modernisation of technical education, which have not even been shown to students, like laptop, video phone, cellular phone, 29-inch colour television and other electronic goods.

""Ineligible and unqualified persons are appointed as part-time lecturers.Amarjyoti, who is just a diploma holder, was appointed as part-time lecturer in MOP department. Arpna Gupta was appointed as part-time lecturer in architecture department. She too is just a diploma holder.A number of peons, sweepers and malis have been appointed and are withdrawing salaries from studentsâ€™ funds. They are working at his residence as bonded labour.â€�

13,Ex-ministers under scrutiny,"PATHANKOT: At least two former ministers and two members of the subordinate services selection board of Gurdaspur are reported to be under the Vigilance scanner and there is the likelihood of their being booked for having assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.

Former minister Nirmal Kahlon and former Dinanagar MLA Roop Rani have already been booked on graft charges and are absconding.

While Sucha Singh Chotepur has charged the former PWD minister Sucha Singh Langah and demanded a high-level probe into what he called â€˜enormous amassed wealth,â€™ sources in the ruling Congress said another former minister from the district, who has constructed a dental college and hospital in the memory of his father, is also under suspicion for â€˜â€˜corrupt deals.â€™â€™

Similarly, two members of SSSB, one each from Batala and Gurdaspur, are likely to be the subject of a Vigilance probe for having â€˜â€˜sold jobs for money.â€™â€™

In one case, the official is reported to have property worth crores, including four houses and some prime business premises that have been rented out.

Not ruling out cases against many others after Kahlon and Roop Rani, the Pathankot MLA and member of the state public accounts committee, Ashok Sharma, said the Amarinder government was committed to eradicating corruption.

Countering the SAD-BJP charge that the state government was indulging in a witch-hunt, Sharma said, â€˜â€˜We had made it amply clear during our poll campaign that the guilty would not be spared.

Now that our government is there, those found guilty of misconduct and corruption are on the run, but we are firm in our resolve to book the guilty,â€™â€™ he said.

Warning officials against any â€˜wrongdoingâ€™ on their part, Sharma said the new government has already given clear-cut instructions to officials to provide immediate redress to the problems of the people.

Officials found harassing people or indulging in corruption would be firmly dealt with by the government, he added.

Asked for his comment on the May Day refrain of the workers that the present government had reneged on its pre-poll promises, Sharma said, â€˜â€˜The first priority of the government is to pull the state out of dire straits.â€™â€™

He said as soon as the economy got back on rails, the government would work towards meeting the aspirations of the people. The results would be evident in the next six months, he said.

14,CM asks farmers not to sow Bt cotton,"CHANDIGARH:Amid the spate of corruption cases involving Akali ministers, former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal adopted a defiant stance on Wednesday.

He said chief minister Amarinder Singh was living â€˜in a foolâ€™s paradiseâ€™ if he believed he could subdue the Akalis with the â€˜â€˜cycle of repression unleashed on them.â€™â€™

The new-found power appears to have gone to his head, said Badal in a reference to Amarinder and warned that, â€˜â€˜A situation of dangerous social and political confrontationâ€™â€™ had been created in the state during the two-month rule of the latter.

Talking to media-persons at his residence here, Badal strived to look unfazed amid mounting charges of corruption against him and his former cabinet colleagues.

Even as he evaded the issue of his governmentâ€™s failure to tackle corruption in spite of hordes of complaints, Badal attacked Amarinder for â€˜â€˜unleashing repression against the Akalisâ€™â€™ in the name of fighting corruption.

He ducked questions like why he had shirked taking action against the Punjabi University vice-chancellor or the PPSC chairman and others, though their irregularities were brought to his notice time and again.

He instead accused the Amarinder government of hatching conspiracies to defame him and his colleagues. Badal claimed nobody in the state could say they had bribed him during the five-year SAD-BJP rule. â€˜â€˜Even in the corruption case against PPSC chairman Ravinder Pal Sidhu, no Akali leader was involved in bribing him,â€™â€™ Badal said.

Asked to comment on the son of his trusted servant, Kala, and the son of an OSD making it to the list of DSPs, Badal denied they were ever selected by the PPSC. He also denied that any of Sidhuâ€™s touts had visited his residence in Sector 9 here with a question paper and an answer sheet, as claimed by Jagman Singh. Badal argued that nobody stayed in the stated house when he was chief minister.

He wondered why the entire Ravi Sidhu case was being projected as if it was a commentary on the state of corruption during the SAD-BJP rule. We had reports about corruption in the PPSC. But we had no idea about its extent.

Nobody knew, not even the Vigilance officials, that Sidhu had made such big money in a fraudulent manner.

Badal agreed that all those officials who got selected after bribing the chairman should be made to quit their jobs.

Expressing concern over police cases being framed against Akali workers, the SAD president said, â€˜â€˜Fear psychosis has been let loose in the state through an indiscriminate use of government machinery.â€™â€™

He said Amarinder had neither the will nor the capacity for governance. That is why he had turned Punjab into a â€˜police state.â€™

The chief minister has chosen as his advisers and key officials people who were infamous for their role in crushing human rights and indulging in all kinds of nefarious activities, Badal said, adding, these people had again started their old conspiracies in the state.

We accept the challenge, said Badal, giving a call to his workers to be prepared for any kind of confrontation with the government.

15,BJP MPs rule out Modi’s removal,"NEW DELHI: Having defeated the Opposition-sponsored motion in the Lok Sabha on the Gujarat issue, a delegation of BJP MPs on Wednesday had meetings with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Home minister L K Advani and ruled out removal of chief minister Narendra Modi, saying that the assembly polls in the state would be fought under his leadership.

At the meeting with Advani, they discussed the prevailing situation in Gujarat and steps to be taken to restore normalcy in the state. Party president Jana Krishnamurthy, former chief minister Keshubhai Patel and Central ministers Kashiram Rana and Harin Pathak were also present on the occasion.

â€˜â€˜The next assembly elections will be fought under Modiâ€™s leadership,â€™â€™ Rana said when asked about the possibility of the removal of the chief minister in the wake of Opposition demand as also from some of the NDA allies.

Advani, who represents Gandhinagar in the Lok Sabha, had a detailed discussion on the state with emphasis on the Rs 150-crore package announced by Vajpayee in Lok Sabha.

Stating that they met Vajpayee on the occasion of Gujarat Day, minister of state for defence production Harin Pathak said the MPs raised issues such as hike in the royalty for indigenous crude oil, sharing of profit under the new exploration licensing policy and raising of the Sardar Sarovar Project to 110 metres.

They said that Prime Minister assured that he would convene a meeting with petroleum minister Ram Naik as early as possible on the royalty issue.

16,LS adjourned till 2 pm on Tehelka issue,"NEW DELHI: Heated exchanges between the Opposition and Treasury benches over a CPM member''s refusal to ask a question to Defence Minister George Fernandes ""till he does not come out clean in Tehelka case"" forced adjournment of Lok Sabha for two hours.

The exchanges broke out when the MP, Sunil Khan, stood up during Question Hour and said ""I will not ask a question to him till he does not come out clean in the Tehelka case.""

Khan''s question related to the accessing of defence files by journalist R V Pandit and whether he was authorised to do so.

While Fernandes sat smiling, BJP, Samata Party and some other NDA MPs charged Khan with ""wasting time of the House"". The Congress, Left and RJD members stood up to protest the presence of the Defence Minister who, they said, had not yet been given a ""clean chit"" in the Tehelka probe.

Reacting to the turmoil in the House, Deputy Speaker P M Sayeed ruled that the CPM member had withdrawn his question and, as per rule, its answer will also not be printed.

This did not satisfy the Treasury benches, who continued with their tirade against the CPM member.

Sayeed also chided BJP''s Kirit Somaiya for walking up to Lok Sabha officials and showing them the rule book. As the turmoil continued, the Deputy Speaker adjourned the House till 2.00 pm.

17,Oppn puts govt on mat in RS for inaction in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: The Opposition has said in the Rajya Sabha that the entire country was ""disillusioned"" with the government's inaction in curbing violence that threatened the unity and integrity of the country. Though the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of Gujarat took oath under the provisions of the Constitution to run Governments without any discrimination, ""it was unfortunate that the faith expressed by the country was breached and shattered to pieces"", Congress leader Arjun Singh alleged in the Upper House on Thursday. Initiating a discussion on the Gujarat issue under rule 170 which entails voting, he said the BJP claimed it was a party with a difference but its government in Gujarat had failed to maintain communal harmony. The entire nation was disillusioned with the government, the Congress leader alleged. The incidents in Gujarat were against the very principles of the Constitution which reaffirmed certain values and it was the responsibility of the state to protect these values, he said. The people's disappointment with the BJP was evident from the results of the recent assembly polls. BJP members took strong exception when Singh referred to the writings of RSS ideologue guru Golwalkar that the country had to learn from the Nazi movement, saying the member should confine himself to Gujarat. Referring to the suggestions made by National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) after its visit to Gujarat, Singh demanded explanation of what the government had done to implement them.

18,Modi's removal won't improve law and order: Jaitley,"NEW DELHI: The Union Law Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday reiterated governmentâ€™s stand that removal of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi would not help improve law and order situation in the state.

Speaking during the opposition sponsored censure motion debate in Rajya Sabha, Jaitley defended the role of the police in curbing violence in the state.

Giving details, the minister said that over 57,500 arrests have been made in Gujarat in the last two months. Of these, 14,144 arrests were for specific criminal charges while 23,218 were preventive in nature.

Refuting oppositionâ€™s allegations of misuse of police powers, Jaitley said of the total arrests made in the state, over 19,500 persons belonged to the majority community.

He posed the question to the opposition whether removal of one person would make a difference in resolving the issue of violence in the state.

The minister also pointed out that transferring the police cases filed in the state to Central Bureau of Investigation would lead to unnecessary delay in filing charges.

19,TDP rules out withdrawing support to NDA govt,"HYDERABAD: A day after it walked out in Lok Sabha during the censure motion on Gujarat situation, NDA''s key ally TDP on Thursday ruled out withdrawing support and asserted it was still backing the Vajpayee government.

""We are with the government right from day one and continue to do so. We have never said that we will withdraw support,"" Goud said.

The 28-member strong TDP in the Lok Sabha is a crucial supporter of the NDA from outside and its boycott of voting on the Censure motion on Wednesday signalled the first open confrontation with the government.

Asked about TDP''s stand on the issue of speakership in the Lok Sabha, Goud said the party leadership will be taking a decision.

The post of Speaker has been lying vacant since TDP''s G M C Balayogi was killed in a helicopter crash.

The slot was believed to be going to a TDP nominee but Wednesday''s boycott of the voting has injected an element of uncertainty.

BJP spokesman V K Malhotra said in Delhi on Wednesday ""how can the Speaker''s post be with a party which is against the government. It should be with a person who is with the government,"" he asked.

20,Muslim-Dalit rally for Modi’s trial,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 50,000 people, mostly Muslims and Dalits, gathered in Ramlila ground on Thursday, under the aegis of the â€˜Save India Frontâ€™ to protest against what they said was the communal politics of the BJP and Sangh Parivar in Gujarat. Terming the BJP â€˜â€˜anti-Muslim, anti-Dalit, anti- poor and anti-Constitutionâ€™â€™, the meeting took a vow to fight against divisive forces. A large number of the demonstrators had come from Uttar Pradesh.

Addressing the gathering, the former BSP leader Arif Mohammad Khan said, â€˜â€˜What is happening in Gujarat is not a communal riot but violence managed and sponsored by the state.â€™â€™ He also stressed that the Godhra incident and subsequent violence in Ahmedabad should not be seen separately. He highlighted the â€˜â€˜doublespeakâ€™â€™ of senior BJP leaders like Prime Minister Vajpayee and L K Advani. â€˜â€˜Advani first said ISI is behind Godhra and retracted few days later. Similarly, Vajpayee has been speaking in different voices in Gujarat and Goa. They themselves do not know who did it.â€™â€™ Khan demanded that Modi should be tried for the killings in Gujarat and blamed leaders in Delhi for allowing the situation to get out of hand.

Udit Raj of the All India Confederation of SC/ST Employees emphasised the need for â€˜â€˜mass actionâ€™â€™ against the â€˜â€˜anti-Dalit and anti-Muslim policyâ€™â€™ of the BJP and Sangh Parivar. â€˜â€˜Every time the BJP has faced a political challenge, it has played the communal card. When Mandal report was implemented, Advani went on a Rath Yatra. When Sonia Gandhi joined politics, Christians were attacked systematically all over the country.

21,MCI formulates new rules for doctors,"MUMBAI: Now, you need not wait beyond 72 hours to get your medical records. You can in fact expect them to be retained for three years at least.

You donâ€™t need to fear whether your doctor has the degree to treat you or that he is charging you more. His fee structure, as also his registration number, has to be displayed in his clinic henceforth.

These are some of the new guidelines notified recently by the Medical Council of India in its first comprehensive revision after 1956. Called the Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, these guidelines appear to offer the best case scenario for the patient, though there is some scepticism about their implementation.

If taken seriously, the new guidelines could redefine patient-doctor relationship and healthcare sector in general, experts say.

The guidelines came into force on April 6, but they have not been adequately publicised. In fact, few officials or doctors are aware of them.

Among the more significant norms is the one which requires a doctor to inform the patientâ€™s family of a communicable disease contracted by the patient.

Doctors regard this as a significant amendment, specially in cases of life-threatening diseases like HIV. Says a doctor, â€œEarlier, confidentiality was all-important. But that needed to change in a scenario where it could cost lives.â€�

Many of the changes merely codify new laws and court judgements, but they are considered significant because of their import.

The regulations also insist on having a team of doctors to decide whether to withdraw life-supporting devices from a brain-dead patient â€œand not merely the treating physician aloneâ€�.

In fact, most of the new insertions derive from court judgements or latter-day legislations. The ban on foetal sex selection procedures, for instance, owes to the Pre-Natal Sex Determination Test Act 1994.

The one on communicable diseases derives from a Supreme Court judgement in the case of a Nagaland doctor whose HIV positive status was communicated to his prospective wife.The court concluded that â€œthe right to live a healthy life is a fundamental right under Article 21â€�.

The new rule that a patient be given his records within 72 hours has its probable origin in the Bombay high court judgement a few years ago which directed a hospital to give photocopies of his medical records to the litigant patient, says Dr G M Bhatia, an orthopaedic surgeon.

The guidelines further stress that emergency care cannot be denied to any patient, as directed by the Supreme Court a few years ago.

Continuing Medical Education, the subject of discussion in medical circles for years, has finally been made compulsory for doctors for a minimum of 30 hours for every 5 years.

Any violation of the rules would attract disciplinary action from the MCI or the state councils, including deregistration.

Importantly, the regulations prescribe disposal of complaints within six months. Dr Suhas Pingle, secretary of the General Practitionersâ€™ Association says,â€œWe welcome the requirement to display our fee structure, because the patients would then know how much they are expected to pay. Displaying registration numbers would also weed out the quacks.â€�

22,Nimma's arrest may reveal land mafia nexus,"AMRITSAR: The arrest of the crorepati patwari of Amritsar, Nirmal Singh alias Nimma, is likely to reveal the unholy nexus between property dealers, estate agents, patwaris, deed writers, few senior officials of revenue department, the police and politicians, who jointly operate a powerful land Mafia in the holy city, fleecing the gullible of their hard-earned money by falsely escalating land prices.

Giving detail of the modus operandi of the land Mafia, sources informed that deals of disputed property were struck through deed writers and plots in residential colonies were marked out through property dealers at highly escalated rates. Sometimes, the police was used to vacate rented properties.

One of the leading property dealers of Amritsar, seeking anonymity, said that if the vigilance department conducted a fair inquiry, names politicians and influential government officials would be exposed as these were the people who invested huge sums in such underhand deals. â€˜â€˜It is time to see how impartial the vigilance probe will be,â€™â€™ said he.

A woman, who didnâ€™t want to be quoted, said that she had bought a plot and got its mutation done through Nimma, but when she applied for a bank loan, her application was rejected as the mutation was not in her name.She, and many others like her, are now doing the rounds of the vigilance department in search of justice.

Agreeing that he had received such complaints, SP Vigilance T P S Sandu said he would be able to comment on them only after conducting a thorough probe. Earlier, the vigilance department had unearthed property worth crores in Nimmaâ€™s possession, though his salary is a measly Rs 6,500, following which he was taken into custody. He has been sent to police remand till May 3.

Sandhu told Times News Network here that they were scrutinising Nimmaâ€™s work records and property deals made by him since 1987, and were hopeful of finding out the frauds committed by him. Meanwhile, the bail applications of Apjeet Kaur, Joginder Kaur and Harbhajan Singh, the wife, mother and father, respectively, of former managing director of Amritsar Central Cooperative Bank, Surinder Pal Singh Chhinna, who is in custody, were dismissed.

23,Quota policy has failed: Minister,"KOLAR: The reservation policy has not yielded the desired results. The poor and the downtrodden continue to suffer and Herculean efforts are needed for the upliftment of these classes, said V. Muniyappa, Mines and Geology Minister.

He was speaking after inaugurating the Ambedkar and Babu Jagajeevan Ram Jayanti organized by the District Administration here at Kolar on Monday. Hailing both Ambedkar and Jagjeevanram as two great leaders who gave a voice to crores of dalits across the country, Muniyappa called on the people to emulate the two great souls.

Citing the lack of education as a reason for the backwardness of the Dalits, Muniyappa made a fervent appeal to Dalit organizations to join hands with the government in educating the dalit masses.

K H Muniyappa, Kolar MP who unveiled the portraits of Ambedkar and Babuji, said though reservation is right, it should be utilized properly. He underlined the importance of unity among various Dalit factions.

V.R. Sudarshan, MLC, stressed the need for reservation even in private sector.

24,Pollution-control laws aren't enough: Ramadevi,"BANGALORE: Public health and purity of environment go hand in hand. Municipal laws on pollution should be rigid and women''s organisations can ensure municipal workers enforce these rules.

This was Governor V.S. Ramadevi speaking after inaugurating Parisara 2002, a two-day meet on environment, on Thursday.

Noise pollution too should be added to laws on pollution control. ``While the law only punishes the wrongdoer, a general awareness among people on environmental issues is necessary,'''' she asserted. There''s, after all, logic and rationalism in traditional Indian practices like worshipping and marrying trees, for they ultimately led to conservation.

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board chairman Upendra Tripathi agreed the existing laws are not sufficient to protect the environment. Discussions are on with nearly 900 resident associations to have pollution-watch wardens for each ward. ``Pollute and clean is an old approach. We need to prevent it,'''' he said.

Dr C.G. Krishnadas Nair, former HAL chairman, stressed that environment education should be part of curricula in schools and colleges so that by the time they graduate they have a balanced approach to environment and development. ``Environmental activists should realise the war is not against development and progress; the war is to progress without injury to the environment.'''' And there are many technological solutions to this problem.

The seminar has been organised by the Foundation for Advanced Material Education and supported by various organisations. Conveners of Parisara, Prof E.S. Dwaraka, S.V. Suresh and S.R. Yasavantha say the idea of the meet is to focus attention on methods to combat pollution, trigger interest and change attitudes toward environment.

Other issues include papers on afforestation, planned development, controlling infusion of heavy metals and pesticides into water bodies, methods of managing environment while running a highly-polluting industry.
