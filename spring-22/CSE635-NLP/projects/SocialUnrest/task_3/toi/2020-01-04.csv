3,Mid-term polls likely: Kalyan,"LUCKNOW: Former chief minister and Rashtriya Kranti Party president Kalyan Singh said that in the wake of prevailing fluid political situation in the state, chief minister Mayawati could recommend dissolution of the House and announce mid-term elections. He, however, said that governor Vishnukant Shastri should not accept her recommendation as the government was in minority.

Coalition partners the BJP and the BSP, he told Times News Network, differed on the issue of going to the polls. While the BJP was not ready for immediate elections and wanted to go to the polls along with the Lok Sabha elections, slated to be held in 2004, the BSP was eager for snap polls, Singh said. As for an alternative government, he said it would depend mainly on the Congress and its willingness to join hands with the Opposition led by the Samajwadi Party of Mulayam Singh Yadav.

""If there is a vote of confidence and the Congress decides to vote against the government, then Mayawati can not stand even for a minute,"" he said. Singh, however, compared Mayawati to that of â€˜pindaris'', historically known for loot and plunder. ""In the name of good governance, she has wrought havoc in the state. And, instead of her vote bank, Mayawati this time has increased her note bank,"" Singh said. The Muslim support base of the BSP, Singh said, was going to be eroded. especially because of the tirade launched by state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar against Dalit icon Bhim Rao Ambedkar by projecting him as anti-Muslim. With regard to her action against bureaucrats, he said Mayawati had formed three categories of officers and they were being rewarded and punished not on merit, but on their ""faithfulness"".

Good character roll entries were given to those able to generate sufficient fund by all means, warning to those falling below expectation and suspension to those unable to toe the line, he commented. As for the BJP, he said it was a doomed party now, which could never think of its comeback, at least in UP. Asked about the possibility of his coming back to the BJP, he said: ""I have missed the bus and I have come too far from where I can not think of going back.""

The BJP, he said, had betrayed the people''s confidence by departing from its five mantras, namely shuchita (probity in public life), suraj (good governance), swadeshi, swablamban (self-reliance) and rashtra gaurav (national pride). And now the party of such lofty ideals found itself so helpless that it could not think of without Mayawati to face the people, he added.

4,"Violence, arson mar Bihar bandh; 5,000 held","PATNA: While the state observed a complete bandh on Friday to protest the Saturday ""encounter"" in which three innocent youths were killed by police in Patna, Ashiana Nagar, where the ""encounter"" had taken place, hardly seemed to be an ideal ""ashiana"" as the area witnessed an ugly battle of bricks between heavily armed forces and an equally violent mob throughout the day.

It was virtually a sea of humanity near the Dumra police outpost at Sheikhpura with over 20,000 people, including men, women and children, coming out on the streets to fight a pitched battle with BMP and RAF jawans.

Over 36 policemen, including sergeant major Gopal Paswan, were hurt as they were hit by stones. The police made an unsuccessful attempt to disperse the mob by opening 18 rounds of fire in the air. Central range DIG Ravindra Kumar and Patna division commissioner Rajesh Gupta were leading the forces.

People had started gathering on the stretch between the Dumra outpost and Ashiana Nagar Mor since morning. The police initially chose not to enter the area and hours passed off peacefully.

However, the trouble arose around 11 am when a part of the mob moved closer to the Dumra outpost. The police chased them. The forces appeared to be under a siege when people, including women and children, started throwing stones from atop their houses in the area. Around 3.15 pm, additional reinforcement led by SSP Sunil Kumar arrived on the scene but to no avail.

The forces were openly demanding orders from their officers to open fire. Though they did get orders to open fire in the air, undeterred youths continued to throw stones on the police and yell, ""Mar goli nahin to bhag (either shoot us or go away)"".

The police then asked the people on the public address system to return to their homes because ""ab firing ki jayegi (the police will now open fire)"". The announcement added to the mob fury. The crowd moved ahead and attacked the police with whatever they could lay their hands on.

Later, the officers leading the police party, virtually surrendered before the mob and the public address system announced: ""Aap sab log baith jaiye, SSP saheb aap se baat karenge (please be seated, the SSP will talk to you)"". As the mob had no leader, hundreds of youths came closer to the police to chorus, ""Hamein police nahin chahiye (we donâ€™t want police)"".

Till late evening, a smaller mob camped on Bailey Road apprehending late night police operations against the agitators. The administration disconnected power supply to the streetlights between Sheikhpura and Ashiana. Top police officers, including Special Branch IG A K Gupta, Patna zone IG A C Verma and DIG Kumar, camped near the Dumra outpost which was being guarded by a large posse of policemen.

While all the vehicles were stopped near the outpost and asked to take a different route, some policemen entered some houses in Sheikhpura. However, senior officers immediately checked them. Meanwhile, the administration late in night engaged a number of PMC sweepers and vehicles to remove the stones from the roads.

5,Rly suffers loss of Rs 3 crore due to bandh,"DANAPUR: The railways suffered a loss of about Rs 3 crore due to the suspension of train movement and cancellation of about 50 pairs of long-distance passenger trains in the wake of the 12-hour Bihar bandh on Friday, said an East-Central Railway (ECR) official.

The ECR official admitted that the cancellation of revenue generating super fast trains â€” Sampoorna Kranti, Magadh Express, Shramjeevi Express, Janshatabdi Express, Rajdhani Express and several other long-distance trains â€” not only caused a heavy financial loss to the railways but also resulted in immense hardship to the people.

The Patna junction, which alone generates the revenue of Rs 50 lakh a day, suffered a heavy loss in earning.

6,State govt alarmed by fresh polio cases,"PATNA: With 39 fresh cases of polio being reported from different parts of the state between November 12 and December 27 last year, the Bihar government is at its witsâ€™ end to know how to prevent the disease from taking a UP-like turn which accounted for 1,135 of the 1,398 polio cases reported in the country last year. Only 12 such cases were reported in Jharkhand.

With the National Immunisation Day (NID) falling on January 5, the Bihar government has decided to pay special attention to the districts bordering UP.

State immunisation officer R K Chaudhary told TNN that 90 per cent of the 97 cases reported in Bihar last year carry the UP strain. Chaudhary said a majority of the cases were reported from the districts bordering UP.

The first round of immunisation will start on January 5 and conclude on January 9 during which about 32,000 teams of government employees will visit every house to administer anti-polio drops to 1.96 crore children in the 0-5 years age group.

The government has directed all the district officials concerned to establish special booths in the areas bordering UP.

The idea is to cordon off all the bordering districts by ensuring hundred per cent immunisation, Chaudhary said.

He, however, admitted that a lot will depend on the efforts being made by the UP government to combat the disease in that state. Against only 27 cases reported in 2001, 97 new cases were reported in Bihar last year. Of the 97 cases, 74 were reported between September 29 and December 27. All the cases were of the P1W type. This despite the fact that last year two rounds of sub-national immunisation days (SNIDs) were observed in Bihar on September 29 and November 17. In 2000, only 50 cases of polio were reported in Bihar.

Taken aback by the abnormal spurt in polio incidence in the state after the September 29 round of SNID, medical education and family welfare secretary Afzal Amanullah had requested the Union health ministry on November 12 to check the effectiveness of the anti-polio vaccine being supplied by it to all the states and Union territories for combating the P1W strain.

A senior official of the department, however, told TNN on January 1 last that the chemical tests of different batches of the vaccine revealed that there was nothing wrong with the vaccine.

Amanullah had told TNN in November that the vaccine manufacturers wanted to perpetuate the disease in India due to vested interest. Besides, he added, the manufacturers wanted to project a bad image of India.

Amanullah, in his SOS to Union family welfare secretary J V R Prasada Rao, had maintained that the vaccine supplied to Bihar was probably not effective enough to combat the P1W strain. â€œThere can be no single cause or excuse for such an abnormal rise. Therefore, I am led to believe that the vaccine may not be effective against the P1W strain. I am not aware whether every batch of the vaccine is thoroughly tested or not,â€� Amanullah had told Rao.

7,NDA to intensify agitation against RJD govt,"PATNA: The NDA on Saturday resolved to further intensify its agitation launched after the killing of three students in a fake police encounter here and claimed that the protest had taken the shape of a mass upsurge against the Rabri Devi ministry.

9,Nagaland govt prepared to lay down office if required,"KOHIMA: Welcoming the scheduled arrival of the NSCN(I-M) leadership in India, the ruling Congress in Nagaland on Saturday said it was willing to relinquish office if required for an honourable settlement of the Naga political problem.

""At this critical juncture, the party, therefore, reiterates its declared stand that as and when any honourable and acceptable solution is arrived at, we are prepared to lay down offices for smooth transition to a new arrangement,"" the NPCC Working President Hoketo Sumi said here in a statement.

The Political Committee of NPCC on Friday reviewed the political situation in the state and maintained that the NSCN(I-M) leadership coming to India was a welcome step towards progress in the Naga peace process, he said.

NSCN(I-M) Chairman Issac Chishi Swu and General Secretary Th Muivah are to arrive in New Delhi on January eight to hold political talks with Prime Minister A B Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani the next day.

The NPCC meeting felt that while working out a political framework on the basis of substantive issues of the talks, the views and opinions of all sections of the Naga community should be sought. Any settlement without unanimity might negate the efforts of leaders on both sides.

The state Congress also appealed that all concerned parties approach the issue with ""an open mind and without any prejudice"" in the larger interest of the people of Nagaland.

The last assembly elections to the 60-member house in February, 1998, was boycotted by all political parties at the call of the NSCN(I-M) and NGOs, save the Congress.

11,Conversion an issue in polls: Rajnath,"RAIPUR: Urging Congress president Sonia Gandhi to direct the Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi to stop conversions in the state, BJP General Secretary Rajnath Singh on Saturday said his party would make it an election issue in the Assembly elections, due later this year. â€œSonia should direct Jogi to stop conversions, that are taking place in the state by luring people and by fear and pressure,â€� Singh told reporters here at the BJP state office.

â€�Conversions should not take place by pressure and no one should take advantage of the poor financial condition of the people here,â€� he said. â€œIf the missionaries wanted to work for the poor no one can stop them but that should not be on the condition of conversions,â€� Singh said adding the statistics on conversion revealed something else and hence he wanted Sonia to check conversion by directing her party government. Chhattisgarh had a special identity because of its culture and tradition and there should be no interference with the basic character of the state otherwise people would treat it as an attack on their self-pride (swabhiman), Singh said. To a question, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said BJPâ€™s Rajya Sabha MP from Chhattisgarh Dillip Singh Judeo was engaged in checking conversions in the state and denied he was trying to create disturbances, as alleged by the ruling party.

12,State BJP to blend Hindutva with development,"GANDHINAGAR: The BJP state executive, which met for a daylong session here on Saturday, decided to keep the tempo on after the assembly election victory in view of the 89 nagarpalika, two district panchayat and several taluka panchayat elections likely to be held in mid-February.

Speaking to newspersons after the meeting, which was also attended by deputy prime minister L K Advani, party vicepresident Bhupendra Solanki said that the BJP would carry out a campaign to enrol new members from January 6 till the end of this month. ""Currently, we have 11 lakh primary members. We plan to increase the number to 20 lakh,"" he said.

This would be coupled with a campaign to take Prime Minister A B Vajpayeeâ€™s developmental plans to the village level so that people could be made aware of what the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre has been doing. Earlier, the partyâ€™s all-India general secretary Arun Jaitley told newspersons, ""We will concentrate on our developmental achievements by combining them with the Hindutva plank.""

The local body polls, party leaders say, are likely to be held on February 16. The chief minister told the executive that he would keep the plan to appoint the chairmen of the state boards and corporations on hold till the polls are over. This despite the fact that the present ones have been asked to resign. The political resolution, endorsing the CMâ€™s statement ""justice to all and appeasement to none"", put a strong emphasis on taking the state in the direction of ""cultural nationalism"" â€” an euphemism for Hindutva.

It said, ""The voters have given us a mandate to fight cross-border terrorism. This would help us carry the mission of cultural nationalism forward."" The resolution also called upon the partyâ€™s units in other states to ""repudiate with full vigour the politics of â€˜fatwaâ€™, which was rejected by the voters in Gujarat"". It emphasised, ""It should be repudiated during both the assembly and the Lok Sabha polls.""

The resolution was moved by former chief minister Suresh Mehta, who was defeated in the recent polls. Winding up the day-long discussion, Modi said, ""It would be impossible for the ministers to carry out the task of good governance without the help of party cadres. ""The government and the party cadres should work unitedly,"" he said.
