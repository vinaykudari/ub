0,C'wealth Games: Metro clinches the deal,"NEW DELHI: Delhi has clinched a first for the country. The Commonwealth Games will be held in the city in 2010.

A part of the credit goes to Delhiâ€™s Metro rail. The cityâ€™s newest acquisition was played up in a big way in front of the special committee that visited the city recently to assess if it was ready to host the games.

The main selling point was the fact that the Metro line to Noida, along the national highway 24, will link the upcoming games village to stadiums and sports complexes all over the city. The Noida line is part of Phase-II of the Metro project.

An indoor stadium and a rugby field proposed at the Yamuna sports complex in Surajmal Vihar will also benefit from the link.

The stadiums â€” Shivaji Stadium, Talkatora Stadium, Dr Ambedkar Stadium, Indira Gandhi Stadium, National Stadium, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and Siri Fort Sports Complex â€” are either directly connected by the Metro or are at short distances from the line.

""About 10 days ago, we made a detailed presentation to the games committee visiting the city on the kind of communication link the Metro will provide by 2010. Obviously, the impact was clear,"" said Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) chief spokesperson Anuj Dayal.

DMRC managing director E Sreedharan had also proposed to prepone the completion date of Phase-II to 2009 instead of 2010, if the games were held in Delhi.

""The detailed project report (DPR) for the second phase is already being prepared and will be ready by January. The Metro lines have to be operational before 2010 when the games will be held,"" said Dayal.

Metro officials say the rail will provide world-class commuting experience to the foreign delegates, sportsmen and sports enthusiasts visiting the city.

""During the Asiad, special buses ran all across the city. In this case, buses will be required for very short distances. For instance, linking the Yamuna sports complex to the Shahdara Metro station,"" said Dayal.

1,"1,029 nomination papers filed for elections","NEW DELHI: The state election department received 659 nomination papers for the December assembly poll on Friday, taking the final tally to 1,029. This was the last date for filing nomination papers.

Independents, numbering 461, topped the list of those who filed their papers on the last date. The Congress followed them with 112 nominations. According to chief electoral officer, Arun Goyal, nomina- tion papers of 700 independent candidates have been received.

Election department officials said although the Congress list was out by Wednesday night, the candidates, except for urban development minister A K Walia, refrained from filing the nominations. The reason: the date â€” November 13, was considered inauspicious.

A total of 143 candidates had filed their nomination papers on Thursday, including 113 independents. On Friday, 54 nominations were filed by BJP candidates and 30 by those of the Nationalist Congress Party.

2,Congress ready for early polls,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday said that it was â€œmore than readyâ€™â€™ to face early polls in Andhra Pradesh and called for an â€œanti-NDA allianceâ€™â€™ that might include the Left parties and the Telangana Rashtriya Samiti (TRS).

But the party finds itself at a loss to take a stand on the ticklish issue of a separate Telangana state. The issue was discussed at the conclave of top party leaders here but â€œno decisionâ€™â€™ had been taken, party spokesman S Jaipal Reddy told reporters.

â€œWe have differences of opinion,â€™â€™ Reddy admitted. The issue is crucial for the party, considering that 41 of the 95 MLAs in the dissolved House are from Telangana.

Sensing the Congress dilemma, the ruling TDP has said it stands for an â€œintegrated Andhra Pradeshâ€™â€™.

The Congress response on Friday was tactical: it sought to throw the ball back in the Union governmentâ€™s court by reiterating its demand that a second Statesâ€™ Reorganisation Commission be constituted to look into the demands of various regions.

Jaipal Reddy also tried to point at the contradiction in the TDPâ€™s stand and that of its partner, the BJP. The latter, he pointed out, has passed a resolution demanding a separate Telangana.

Although the TDP move for early polls was expected, Congress activists from Telangana camped here for some days and were told only on Thursday that they should put their demand on hold and work for the elections.

Barely out of the nomination process for the December 1 polls, the top Congress leadership went into a huddle to work out a strategy to fight the TDP-BJP combine.

â€œWe welcome the developments in Andhra Pradesh. We are more than ready for polls.â€™â€™ Jaipal Reddy said. At the same time, he dismissed as â€œfalse and perverseâ€™â€™, Naiduâ€™s assertion that the oppositionâ€™s â€œattitudeâ€™â€™ had forced him to dissolve the assembly.

â€œNaidu has been running the government for four and a half years with two-third majority. What difficulty has he encountered now?â€™â€™ Reddy said.

Meanwhile, senior leaders, including Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and Ghulam Nabi Azad, held discussions with state party leaders, including PCC chief D Srinivas and CLP leader Y S Rajshekhar Reddy.

5,'Good law and order must for Barh plant',"PATNA: ""If the law and order situation of the state does not improve, the super thermal power plant at Barh may not be completed within the stipulated period of time.""

National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) executive director, Eastern Region headquarter Balmiki Prasad told mediapersons here on Friday, ""we have already discussed this matter with the minister as well as the chief secretary on various occasions. We have not received any kind of political pressure while awarding four contracts for Barh super thermal power plant,â€� Prasad said.

In Barh and North Karanpura (Jharkhand), boiler of super critical technology will be installed. Contract for major infrastructural activities like site leveling have already awarded to M/s NBCC and they have mobilised in Barh project, he added. For bringing earth for site levelling job at Barh, widening of culverts are being taken up with railways.

Bidding for main plant equipment at Barh has already been invited, he said. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had laid the foundation stone of this ambitious project (660x3 MW) in 1999 amidst much fanfare. The plant site is lying barely four kilometres east of the Barh town on National Highway-31 in Patna district.

The main power plant and the township would be spread over an area of 1,186.01 acres of land, while the 1,733.17 acres of land would be kept for ash dyke. As regards the takeover of Bihar''s Muzaffarpur Thermal Power Station on a 30-year long term lease, Prasad said that NTPC has decided to accept only 110 workforce of the MTPS on a selective basis. According to an estimate, more than 500 skilled personnel are employed in MTPS.

He also said that NTPC has planned to invest Rs 380 crore for the renovation and modernisation of the MTPS units. R&M jobs will be over in five years'' time period and then power generation from this plant would increase manifold, he added. The NTPC has also put a proposal for the management fee of Rs 13 crore per year, he said.

After the completion of R&M job in MTPS, the cost of per unit would be Rs 2.38 paise of the power generated by the MTPS, but at the same time he said in between the R&M work, the per unit cost would be around Rs 4.30.

6,'Bhakts' clash with police over idols,"PATNA: The police fired five rounds in the air and lobbed more than 50 tear-gas shells near the Indira Gandhi Planetarium under the Kotwali police station on Friday afternoon.

The firing was to disperse an irate mob protesting against the administration''s decision to remove the idols of Lord Hanuman and Lord Shiva installed close to the western gate of the planetarium. Though none was injured in the police firing, a few passers-by were injured in the stampede.

The police also fought a pitched battle with the agitators. The police claimed that a group of people opened fire near the spot during the pitched battle.

However, the policemen and administration officials had to return without removing all the idols from the site. Later, local residents were seen singing religious songs there in the evening.

The trouble started when a team from the district control room along with policemen reached the site and started removing the idols using hammers. A mob assembled there and started pelting the officials and policemen with brickbats. It finally led to a pitched battle between the policemen and the agitators at least for an hour near the spot.

The mob forced the policemen to escape from the idol site and take shelter on the planetarium premises.

The mob surrounded them from all sides. Seeing the mob moving towards them, the policemen opened fire in the air in order to protect themselves. The movement of traffic came to a complete halt on Bailey Road near the site.

Later, officer in charge of the control room P P Sharma sent a message seeking additional reinforcement. The reinforcement reached the spot only half an hour later. In the meantime, Kotwali DSP Shashi Bhushan Sharma along with a few policemen reached the spot and chased the mob in order to bring the situation under control. An anti-riot vehicle was also deployed there.

Talking to mediapersons, Sukhbir Das, a priest, said the idols had been installed there about two decades ago. According to him, this site was allotted by the administration for construction of a temple which earlier existed on the nearby Ravidas Ashram premises.

District administration sources said an application had been submitted to the DM by the director of the planetarium requesting him to remove the â€œunauthorisedâ€� constructionsâ€�.

7,Salt Lake IT hub bags Rs 6 cr for development,"KOLKATA: The state government has decided to invest Rs 6 crore to develop infrastructure at Salt Lake sector V â€“ the state''s showpiece information technology hub.

The funds, spread over three years, will be pumped into development of physical infrastructure like drainage and sewerage. A part of the funds will also be used to relay and maintain roads.

This decision was taken at a recent meeting chaired by urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharya and attended by officials of Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority and the Bidhannagar Municipality.

The move comes close on the heels of a survey conducted by the state information technology department to gauge the perception of different IT firms operating out of the area. The results had indicated distinct dissatisfaction at the lack of basic civic amenities at the Salt Lake Electronic complex.

Top officials of leading IT and ITES companies had also met IT secretary G.D. Gautama and Webel managing director S.K. Mitra, highlighting the need to beef up physical and social infrastructure.

Lack of adequate street lighting, poor public transport connectivity and absence of eateries were the major lacunae.

""In other ITES centres like Gurgaon, the 24Ã—7 concept is a reality with coffee shops, restaurants remaining open round-the-clock,"" the software executives said.

8,Tout's arrest at SSKM exposes staff nexus,"KOLKATA: The detective department on Friday arrested a tout from SSKM hospital. Twenty-eight-year-old Chote Lal has also named four persons who were with him in the racket. At least two of them are key hospital officials.

Interrogation of three touts, arrested earlier from R.G.Kar Hospital and Calcutta Medical College Hospital, indicates a strong nexus between these middlemen and few hospital officials.

DC (DD-I) Soumen Mitra said a few suspicious hospital staff are already under scanner.

According to the police, Chote Lal stayed at SSKM''s New Staff Quarters for several years. On Friday, when sleuths posing as patients'' relatives asked for a bed, they were approached by Lal and one Aloke Kumar Das.

The duo promised the sleuths quick admission for Rs 500. Lal told cops during interrogation that apart from his own relatives, he knew other hospital staff who helped him get beds.

Interestingly, a senior officer said that the touts did not always have to bend rules. ""It is not possible for patient''s relatives to know the number of beds available.

The touts exploit this and the patients end up paying hundreds for a bed which is already free,"" the officer said.

The touts can easily manipulate the queue for free beds and get their clients in. The duo also claimed they received commission for sending people to the flourishing diagnostic centres adjacent to the hospital.

Mitra admitted they are keeping a watch on possible involvement of hospital staff.

""Action can only be taken if such claims are corroborated by hard evidence and proved beyond reasonable doubt,"" he said. The police, however, said raids against touts would continue.

10,"Fiscal review good in numbers, but bad in law?","NEW DELHI: Is the finance ministry heading for a showdown with Parliament? Without waiting for Parliamentâ€™s winter session to begin on December 2, the ministry on Friday came out with the Mid-Year Review, which is also the second quarter review of this yearâ€™s fiscal trends.

The review, which presents a rosy picture of the economy, is being seen in political circles as an attempt by the BJP-led government to tom-tom its achievements ahead of the assembly elections to five states.

The Election Commission had earlier intervened to stop an advertisement campaign, called â€˜â€˜Shining Indiaâ€™â€™, which was being carried out by the finance ministry to publicise Indiaâ€™s booming economy.

The presentation of the review at a news conference by top ministry officials seems to be in breach of the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003.

Clause 7 (1) of the law says: â€˜â€˜The minister incharge of the ministry of finance shall review, every quarter, the trends in receipts and expenditure in relation to the Budget and place before both Houses of Parliament the outcome of such reviews.â€™â€™

Seeking to justify the action, finance secretary D C Gupta said: â€˜â€˜We wanted the review to be timely. Parliament is not in session and it will commence only in December. We did not want the review to be delayed.â€™â€™

The main Opposition, the Congress, however, criticised the governmentâ€™s action. â€˜â€˜Once again the government has shown scant regard for Parliament with an eye on elections. If that was not the case, it would have waited for the winter session to commence,â€™â€™ said Congress spokesman Anand Sharma.

Chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri replied in negative when asked if the government had secured the leave of Parliament to bring out the review outside it ahead of the winter session.

Lahiri claimed the FRBM Act does not require the government to â€˜â€˜presentâ€™â€™ the review in Parliament. It only requires the review to be â€˜â€˜placedâ€™â€™. The review can be â€˜â€˜placedâ€™â€™ before the Houses in the winter session, he said.

12,6 including two NRIs held booked for`kabootarbazi',"MOGA: While the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday, had expressed concern on the practice of human trafficking and cheating of the public by the travel agents and some unscrupulous persons and asked the state government to identify the dimensions of the crime in Punjab, more reports of cheating of the gullible persons are pouring in here.

On Saturday, the Moga police have registered two criminal cases in which some NRIs and three travel agents cheated two youth of Rs 12 lakh.

In a complaint made to the district police in charge, one Sandeep Singh of Bagha Purana town of the district alleged that in 2001 he had paid Rs 5 lakh to one Pyara Singh of Bhugipura village here as the latter had promised to marry his Canada settled girl with Ashok Kumar, a partner of Sandeep in a finance company.

Sandeep Singh alleged that they had agreed to pay Rs 11 lakh in total for the marriage with NRI girl and Rs 5 lakh was paid as advance to Pyara Singh, his sister Mohinder Kaur and one mediocre Paramjeet Kaur.

But last year, Sandeep came to know that the girl was married to another boy and when he demanded Pyara Singh to return the amount the latter allegedly refused.

For the last one year, Sandeep was making rounds of the house of Paramjeet Kaur at Moga and Pyara Singh to get returned his amount but all efforts yielded nothing.

But as the state police have adopted a very strict posture against fleecing of youths in the name of sending them aboard these days, so Sandeep made a complaint to the district police chief and after an inquiry by the police a case under Section 406, 420 of IPC has been registered against Paramjeet Kaur, Pyara Singh and Mohinder Kaur.

In another case, Rajinder Singh of Kahan Singh Wala village here made a complaint against three travel agents. The complainant had alleged that Chiranjee Lal of Moga, Ramesh Nand and Kuldeep Chand of Uttam Nagar, New Delhi, charged Rs 7 lakh from him for sending him to Canada in April 1999. But for the last three years, the agents were always evasive in returning amount and sending him aboard. The police have registered a criminal case against the agents on Saturday.
