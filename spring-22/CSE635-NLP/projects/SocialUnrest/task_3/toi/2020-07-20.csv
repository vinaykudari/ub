0,Ramoorthy govt to create fund for mega projects,"HYDERABAD: The government will come out with a legislation to create Infrastructure Project Fund and raise Rs 1000 crore to finance the mega infrastructure projects in the state.

The government has also planned to levy cess on petrol, diesel and liquor to service the bonds. The draft legislation is ready and likely to come up before the state cabinet.

The entire ground work has been done by the Infrastructure Development Authority.

Official sources told The Times Of India that bonds would be raised in two annual tranches of Rs 500 crore each and will carry an interest rate of 11 per cent.

The tenure of the bonds will be for ten years and the structure of repayment will be 30 per cent at the end of sixth year, 30 per cent at the end of eighth year and remaining 40 per cent at the end of tenth year. The government will not be offering any guarantee for the bonds, it is said.

Officials and credit agencies who worked out the details had considered ten commodities and items including vehicles, stamp duty, urban property, minerals, goods, passenger bus tickets for levying the cess. But finally selected diesel, petrol and liquor for imposing the cess.

According to the present calculations, diesel will carry a cess of 20 paisa, petrol 50 and liquor will have cess of two per cent on the retail price. The officials also arrived at the revenue and debt service figures till 2015.

Finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure said that the government would come up with a legislation for creating the fund and said the administration was vested with the power to levy cess on the specified commodities by issuing an executive order.

1,HC stops police from arresting bank executive on rape charge,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has restrained the Cuffe Parade police from arresting IDBI executive Porus Mistry on charges of rape. Justice V.M. Kanade passed the interim order on July 14 in response to an anticipatory bail plea by Mr Mistry.

The judge granted the public prosecutor ten daysâ€™ time to file his reply to the anticipatory bail plea and scheduled the matter for hearing on July 25. Mr Mistry was arrested by the Cuffe Parade police on July 7 on sexual offence charges and for allegedly seducing a junior bank employee with false promises. He was released the same night on a bail bond of Rs 10,000.

The complainant alleged that she had an affair with Mr Mistry because she was under the impression that he was unmarried, even though he has a five- year-old child, the police said. The 26-year-old woman has produced evidence in the form of e-mail and SMS messages that he had courted her and promised to marry her. The police had charged Mistry under section 376-b of the Indian Penal code which deals with a public servant seducing a woman in his custody.

The offence is bailable. Mistryâ€™s lawyers, Ashok Mundargi and Shailesh Kantharia, told the high court that the police now want to charge their client with rape. They said since rape was a nonbailable offence, they feared that Mistry would be arrested when he appeared before the magistrate. They said the magistrate would have no powers to release him on bail. Mr Mundargi said the facts of the case based on the complaint did not make out a case of rape.

He said even he application of section 376-b of the IPC against Mistry was incorrect. Mr Mundargi said it was clear that the 26-year-old complainant, who was Mr Mistryâ€™s colleague in the bank, had a relationship with him for almost three-and-a-half years, despite knowing that he was married. He said that she had specified that she was filing the complaint because he had refused to marry her.

The police claim further investigations have revealed that Mistry had sexual intercourse with the complainant many times against her wishes, by promising to marry her, and that he used to take her to the Bengal lodge at CST and to a hotel in Pune. Police officials said since Mr Mistry was not a public servant they dropped 376-b of the IPC and were investigating the matter as a rape case.An application made by the police before the magistrate to charge Mistry with rape has been deferred to July 29.

2,Six persons of Doaba arrested in Ukraine,"PHAGWARA: The Regional Passport Officer, Jalandhar, has said that his office has got information that six persons of Punjabâ€™s Doaba region were arrested in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, for travelling on illegal documents.

â€˜â€˜We have got this information from the embassy concerned and have informed the families of these persons to deposit the air fare for bringing them back,â€™â€™ RPO Amarjit Singh told reporters here on Saturday night.

He said that a few countries, Ukraine being one of them, send free of charge information in such cases. â€˜â€˜Otherwise, countries charge fees even for sending such information about illegal entrants in their respective countries,â€™â€™ he said.

Doaba region comprises districts including Jalandhar, Nawanshahr and Kapurthala.

About his office in Jalandhar, he said 700-800 passports were being issued daily by the Jalandhar office though it was â€˜â€˜highly under-staffed,â€™â€™ having just 64 staff members against its requirement of 111 staff members.

3,NPA stand: Doctors turn to health minister,"HOSHIARPUR: Even though the Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has rejected any roll-back of the non-practising allowance (NPA) to doctors, the PCMS association and PCMS welfare had on Saturday asked health minister RC Dogra to take up the matter with the chief minister.

PCMS welfare general secretary Dr Sardool Singh claimed that the health minister had assured a deputation of doctors that he would discuss with the chief minister the ill-effects of the decision on health services. The deputation of the PCMS doctors led by Dr Hardip Singh and Dr ML Puri had told the health minister that the NPA did not amount to Rs 80 crore as was being mentioned, but was only Rs 30 crore.

PCMS press secretary Dr Ajay Bagga reiterated that NPA was given to the doctors in lieu of the arduous nature of their work. He said the delegation also apprised Dogra that the government could not allow doctors to open private clinics as that was a violation of the civil services rule.

He said the experiment of â€˜paying clinicsâ€™ in the hospital premises had failed two decades ago. Bagga claimed that the representatives told Dogra that health was not a luxury and the present decision of the state government to permit doctors to examine patients by charging a fee in the hospital would force individuals to pay more. He said that the decision would deny the poor cheap medical service.

6,Patiala House: Royal residence to lawless dump,"NEW DELHI: Yet another example of a heritage structure that has been rendered no use at all, both from the heritage perspective and also from the perspective of a public utility building, is the Patiala House.

The building housing the district courts of Delhi, already went through much use and abuse before talks about shifting the courts surfaced.

As many as 3,500 lawyers, 800 chambers and 50 courts are housed in the building. With more than one lakh cases pending, the number of litigants doing the rounds of this building every day, is anybodyâ€™s guess.

And with only two toilets, the situation here is appalling to say the least.

Recently the New Delhi Bar Association and the Delhi Bar Association wrote to the Chief Justice of the Delhi high court asking for space to house 64 judges and adequate chamber space to ensure the smooth functioning of the courts.

A court source said, â€˜â€˜Any major construction work in the Patiala House premises has to be referred to a high court committee and then approved and funded by the Delhi Urban Arts Commission. This basically means that any change to be brought about within the premises, even if it is for the convenience of lawyers and litigants, has to go through a really cumbersome approval process to come into place.â€™â€™

It is due to this that construction of a ramp and a special lift in the Patiala House premises for the convenience of the differently abled, has been pending. So is the proposal to construct a reception counter.

Speaking on conditions of anonymity, a lawyer said, â€˜â€˜There are all these regulations to be adhered to, just for the heritage status of the building.â€™â€™

But he added that no initiative was taken to prevent people visiting the courts from spitting on the walls or relieving themselves at any given place inside the premises. â€œThe governmentâ€™s priorities seem very muddled,â€™â€™ he opined.

""Antony has completely failed on the Marad issue as the process of rehabilitating hundreds of families of minority community is yet to commence"", he told reporters here after visiting the families living in refugee camps.

The chief minister had ""no moral right"" to continue in office after having made certain controversial remarks that had very much hurt the sentiments of minorities, Sait said adding the league should not view the statements lightly.

The state cabinet sub committee, formed by the UDF government following the May 2 violence at Marad to exclusively deal with the issue of restoring peace, served no purpose and should be dissolved immediately he added.

9,UP's 'dead' come alive in protest,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh reportedly has hundreds of people who have been officially declared dead even though they are very much alive. The usual motive is to grab the supposedly dead personâ€™s land.

A dead person cannot own land or the property on it and it is one method the resourceful have used, in connivance with local revenue and police officials. A â€˜Mirtak Sanghâ€™ (union of the deceased) had been formed by a victim Lal Bihari who fought for years to get himself declared â€˜not deadâ€™. He held sit-ins in Delhi, threw petitions on the floor of the state assembly and tried to contest elections in between. Heâ€™s now, the state officially agrees, alive.

But many others who are Mirtak Sangh members are officially registered as dead. Lal Bihari, who now calls himself Lal Bihari â€˜Mirtakâ€™, says they have now decided to hold a â€˜Brahm bhojâ€™, a ritual feast held after someone dies. The feast will be held in front of the state assembly here on July 30. He says it will be attended by 2,000-odd of the living dead.

In a communiquÃ© sent to the CBI, the British authorities said the bank account had been frozen till July 22, by which time ""we expect to receive the request from the Indian government.""

While conceding that it was a race against time, the CBI sources said the Letters Rogatory would reach British authorities by Tuesday requesting them to freeze the account in a London bank.

The 3 million pounds in the London bank account of Quattrocchi had already been frozen by the British authorities pending receipt of a formal request from the Indian Government.

However, the freeze could not be permanent according to British laws and hence the request from the Indian government was necessary by the stipulated time, the sources said.

The probe agency was informed by the Interpol London that they had traced a ""bank account in the name of Ottavio Quattrocchi in which three million pounds had been stashed.""

CBI claimed in its request that it was believed that ""the amount of three million pounds stashed in the bank account was a part of $7.34 million paid to him (Quattrocchi) by A B Bofors through A E Services.""

The British authorities had asked CBI to furnish details of the offence, summary of evidence and an assurance that a confiscation request would soon follow from the Government.

13,Christian priest held for inciting communal passions,"AHMEDABAD: A Christian priest was arrested on charges of ""inciting communal passions"" from Talala in Junagadh district on Monday, after a bus driver working for a missionary-run school lodged a complaint against him.

The All-India Christian Council (AICC) is already crying foul claiming that the complainant was provoked by the VHP and the RSS. The priest, Suresh Thakre, belongs to the Grace Ministry of India and was running a school for orphans called St Thomas school.

The complainant, Gopal Patel, who drives the school bus lodged a complaint at the Talala police station on Sunday afternoon stating that Thakre desecrated a Ganesh idol which he had placed in the bus and also slapped him.

The priest was booked under the IPC for inciting communal passions, (section 153 A), grievous hurt and criminal intimidation. However, according to superintendent of police, RD Balat, ""the incident occurred on July 8 and Patel claimed that he had arguments with the priest on two occasions over this issue even after the incident"".

According to AICCâ€™s Samson Christian, ""Patel had demanded money from the priest and when he did not oblige he stole some stationery from the school and mixed up with VHP and RSS activists who pressurised him to lodge a complaint"".

Christians alleged that the BJP MLA from Talala, Govindbhai Parmar, VHPâ€™s regional secretary from Talala, Pravin Bhatt and VHPâ€™s Kanubhai Bharada pressurised police to take action against the priest at the Talala police station on Sunday.

14,Reinstate dismissed employees: SC to TN govt,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday took a humane view of the ongoing strike by 1.7 lakh Tamil Nadu government employees as it suggested that those who did not indulge in violence could be taken back on tendering an unconditional apology and undertaking that they would not resort to this illegal mode of protest.

The court also declared the strike as illegal and said the Jayalalitha government had sent a ``tough message that maladministration can be cured by this way''''.

A Bench of Justices M B Shah and A R Lakshmanan asked the state government''s counsel K K Venugopal and P P Rao to respond to the suggestion by Thursday when the matter comes up for hearing.

When P Chidambaram and T R Andhyarujina, counsel for the petitioner employees and a DMK leader, questioned the very basis of notifying the ordinance amending the ESMA and the manner in which the employees were prevented from joining duty, the Bench said it appears the employees were repenting over resorting to strike.

Thus, the Bench said, it would be proper if the government allowed them to join duty after they tendered an unconditional apology with their joining report.

The judges disapproved the employees'' stand and said they had thought ``strike is their birth right"".

Venugopal and Rao justified the dismissal of nearly 1.7 lakh striking employees who were dismissed under the amended Essential Services Maintenance Act ordinance on July 4.

The employees had gone on strike protesting against the withdrawal of certain cash benefits under the pension scheme.

Venugopal said that the state government has already reinstated more than 20,000 employees after scrutinising their applications questioning their dismissal.

When counsel Andhyarujina questioned the constitutional validity of the ESMA, the Bench asked ""under which provision of the Constitution, government employees have the right to hold a state government, or any government for that matter, to ransom.""

The Bench further said: ""Strike as a weapon is always misused which results in chaos and total maladministration. There is no constitutional provision under which the government employees can claim as a matter of right to go on strike.""

15,"Govt does not want to pay, employees protest","CHANDIGARH: Since June this year the employees of Punjab State Tubewell Corporation (PSTC), a financially straitened public sector undertaking, have been running around to get their salaries, without success, even as the state government is yet to decide whether to pay their salaries or not.

""We spoke to our managing director (MD) and he told us the corporation is running an overdraft with the government and that is why the government is not releasing salaries,"" PSTC employeesâ€™ union leaders told Times News Network.

""That is true, but I don''t know whether there is an overdraft or not but we (PSTC) have been told that disinvestment of the corporation is under active consideration and have been asked to prepare a note for the cabinet sub-committee on disinvestment,"" PSTC MD R P S Yaduvanshi, who is also Punjab''s chief engineer (canals), said.

In the episode it is the role of the state government that has led to apprehensions amongst the management and the employees of the corporation. The government has not made clear its stand on the issue.

""We were told that they (state government) are in the process of arranging the funds and that the authorisation is ready. But when we approach the treasury officer for salaries we are told that he has no orders from above to release money for salaries,"" Yaduvanshi added.

PSTC has availed secured loans from the state government to the tune of Rs 253.29 crore and Rs 60 crore in unsecured loans from financial institutions.

The corporation has been incurring losses for the past many years in a row and as per the interim balance sheets of PSTC it has been continuously in the red since 1996-97 with its accumulated losses touching Rs 49.98 crores in 2000-01.

""These (salary) problems have been continuing for one year now. Earlier too we had faced such a problem but at that time we had requested the principal secretary finance to help us out and the problem was taken care of. Now it is 21st of the next month and we are yet to get salaries for June. We apprehend that we may not get the salaries next month as well,"" the employees said.

Recently the corporation abolished 150 posts in a ""hush-hush"" manner and this has led to resentment amongst employees.

""The posts that have been abolished are basically lower cadre posts and not those of engineers that are still protected in spite of the order book of the corporation being virtually empty. In many cases the posts of engineers have been protected as they are holding their posts on ''look after'' charge. These posts have not been abolished,"" they said.

16,"SC notices to Centre, UP govt on Ganga ghats","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government on a petition seeking a direction to urgently clean up the 80-odd bathing ghats on the banks of river Ganga in Varanasi where thousands from across the country take a dip every day.

In a petition lawyer Ashok Kumar Thakur said even the most important ghats such as Dasaswamedh, Barnasangam, Panchganjal, Manikarnika and Charanpaduka were in disarray due to the total apathy of the administration.

Accusing the government of achieving very little under the Rs 1,700 crore Ganga Action Plan (GAP) in terms of cleaning the river, Thakur said that about 80 per cent of the untreated sewage still found its way into the river.

He alleged that the water treatment plants built under the Rs 800 crore GAP-Phase-I had made no difference to the situation and the situation in Varanasi was even worse than at Kanpur.

Thakur said ""the valuable and rich heritage, our composite culture, the holy Ganga and its environment, with a number of historic ghats, are required to be preserved and protected in public interest.""

A Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare and Justice S B Sinha said the petition filed by Thakur be tagged with other matter relating to the cleaning process of the river Ganga.

17,India blasts Pak on Yasin Malik arrest comments,"NEW DELHI: Slamming Pakistan for criticising the arrest of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front leader Yasin Malik, India on Monday said Islamabad should stop interfering in its internal affairs and take concrete steps to ``disengage itself from terrorism''''.

Expressing ``disappointment with the continuous manifestation of Pakistan''s negative attitude'''', the ministry of external affairs spokesperson said: ``For engaging with India, Pakistan should disengage itself from terrorism...continuing cross border terrorism is not conducive to building the proper atmosphere for the peace process.''''

Pakistan should concentrate on the ``grievous political and sectarian ills of its own society'''' since it had ``enough problems of its own to worry about'''', said the spokesperson.

``Pakistan should be exhorted to contribute towards creating a proper atmosphere for progressively normalising relations by abjuring gratuitous comments on developments in India which are of no concern to Islamabad,'''' he added.

The Pakistani spokesperson, over the weekend, had termed Malik''s arrest as yet ``another manifestation of India''s policy to brutally suppress the freedom movement'''' in Kashmir.

Asked about a report in a Pakistani magazine that militants had started regrouping across the Line of Control, the spokesman said, ``We would like a complete and permanent end to terrorism and destruction of its infrastructure.''''

On the meeting between visiting Pakistani Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam leader Maulana Fazlur Rahman and Prime Minister Vajpayee, he said the latter had appreciated the PM''s peace initiatives and the developments thereafter for improving ties with Pakistan.

18,Nagar council president's son arrested,"FARIDKOT: The president of Faridkot nagar council, Gurcharan Singh, who is already embroiled in a controversy over the cancellation of tenders of developmental works last week, is in the thick of another storm after his son was arrested by the district police for being the kingpin of a gang of robbers allegedly involved in a number of incidents of robberies and snatching in Punjab and Rajasthan.

Though the police had said that they had busted the gang on Sunday, sources claimed that some members of the gang, including Sarbpal Singh alias Babu, son of the municipal president, were in the custody of Sadiq police for the last about one week.

It is alleged that some political persons were using their influence to pressurise the police to drop Sarbpal''s name from the FIR.

So when the district police last week released a press note stating that some members of a robbers'' gang had been arrested, it intentionally withheld Sarbpal''s name, claimed sources.

Though police declined of Sarbpal being in its custody last week, sources said the decision to include Sarbpal''s name in the FIR was taken after a number of political twists and turns in the case.

Gurcharan Singh, when contacted, said that his son was being victimised by the police. He said that the only fault of his son was that he was involved in a minor scuffle following an accident between a car and a motorcycle.

He said he approached a number of political leaders of the area to get justice but all turned their backs.

District police chief Harinder Chahal, in a press release on Sunday, claimed that three members of the gang, including Sarbpal Singh, were arrested from a cremation ground at Faridkot with arms. The other four members of the gang managed to escape.

The accused have reportedly confessed of snatching Rs 5,000 from a salesman of a petrol pump situated at Ferozepur road here and robbing a shopkeeper at Faridkot of Rs 21,000 after blinding him by throwing chilly powder into his eyes when the latter was riding his scooter.

They also made an abortive bid of robbing a trader in Srigangangar. There were a number of other crimes in which the police was probing their roles.

All the accused were sent to two days police remand on Monday by a judicial magistrate at Faridkot.
