0,Boomtime on bandh day,"KOLKATA: If there was one island of hectic activity in Kolkata on a somnolent bandh day, it was the book fair. Schools, shops and offices might have closed down but business was brisk on the Maidan. Book lovers trooped to the boi mela throughout the day â€” it was as if the agitations and rallies were another world altogether.

Till 4.30 pm, there were 50,000 people on the ground, which soon swelled to over lakh, the Publishers and Book Sellers Guild said. ""The crowd was lesser than in normal days. However, considering it was a bandh day, the turnout was beyond our expectation,"" said Kalyan Shah, secretary of the Guild.

The day started on a slow note. Some stalls â€” major publishers and smaller ones â€” did not even open shop till late in the day. The crowds made them change their mind real quick. ""We were very surprised. Business was quite brisk,"" said the owner of a popular book store.

As the afternoon progressed, all stalls opened up. ""Only the British Council stall didnâ€™t open till 6 pm,"" said Shah.

The only hitch was that a few book launching ceremonies were cancelled because of the bandh. There was some excitement when the SFI took up the alleged Tricolour-disrespect cause where they had left it the previous evening.

SFI general secretary (Kolkata district) led a deputation to the Guild office alleging that stall 101 had pinned the national flag beneath their own organisation flag. When some people protested against the action, it led to scuffle between them and the fair security. ""I cannot take any decision without speaking to the stall owners and the securityguards. We will definitely take a decision by tomorrow and if the stall is found guilty we might even close it,"" Shah said.

1,Basic instinct: Babus in DA heaven now,"NEW DELHI: From cabinet secretary downwards, it''s party time for over four million employees of the Central government.

Finance Minister Jaswant Singh''s decision to merge Dearness Allowance to the extent of 50 per cent of their pay with basic salary, will fatten employees'' purse. The DA is now at 59 per cent of the basic.

Financial planners said that the merger of DA and basic would also increase their perks quite substantially.

Come April and they will have more money in provident funds, will move into bigger homes, get more travel allowance on work and, in many cases, will be able to opt for air travel while availing the Leave Travel Allowance.

Here is an example. If a secretary''s basic salary is Rs 26,000, then his 59 per cent DA works out to be Rs 15,340. In the new regime, his basic pay will jump to Rs 39,000. And, 9 per cent DA on Rs 39,000 will work out to Rs 3,510, an effective raise of Rs 1,170 a month.

Similarly, he gets Rs 7,800 as HRA now. After Tuesday''s announcement, he will get Rs 11,700.

Those, however, who have opted for government accommodation will not benefit from the increase. Besides, after the basic goes up, there will be a considerable jump in PF contribution by the government.

""I am thrilled, my family is thrilled,"" said a Central government employee Ashish Joshi. ""It feels good when you calculate a fat basic and perks.""

A large section of officials also hope to get another 4 per cent hike in DA, with effect from January 2004.

""There is already discussions that the DA will increase by four per cent taking the total to 13 per cent after the adjustment. Sometimes it feels good to be in the governments service,"" said an official.

""In principle, merging DA with basic salary is a good decision, though it will have an adverse effect on revenue deficit. However, spending by central government employees is likely to go up,"" said tax expert R N Lakhotia.

""There won''t be a significant increase in the tax outgo and the lifestyle of an employee will improve,"" said Rajiv Bajaj, MD of Delhi-based financial planning firm Bajaj Capitals.

4,Patil to protest against Centre's 'discrimination',"MUMBAI: The Democratic Front (DF) government in Maharashtra has decided to confront the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre.

State''s home minister R.R. Patil will stage a dharna at Azad Maidan on Wednesday as a part of the ''atmasanman abhiyan'' (self-respect campaign) launched by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to protest against the Central government''s alleged discrimination against the state while allotting funds.

Mr Patil, who also heads the state unit of the NCP, is unhappy with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who has announced only Rs 40 crore towards drought relief while addressing a meeting at Pandharpur recently.

The state government had demanded Rs 1,712 crore and 10 lakhs tonnes of grains to tide over the drought situation.

However, the Centre has so far given only two lakh tonnes of grains. In fact, Mr Patil wanted the state government to return Rs 40 crore to the Centre, but chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde disagreed with him.

Mr Patil will be staging a dharna while the rest of the cabinet will be in Delhi on Wednesday to plead with the Union government for more aid.

The campaign will culminate in a rally, to be held at Ahmednagar, on February 16, which will be addressed by NCP president Sharad Pawar.

The NCP is apparently planning to whip up resent ment against the NDA government in the run up to the elections.

5,"Rs 818 cr for polls, parties to spend more","NEW DELHI: The coming Lok Sabha polls will cost the state exchequer Rs 818 crore. This was indicated by Finance Minister Jaswant Singh in his interim Budget.

Seeking Parliament''s leave to dip into the Consolidated Fund of India, Singh asked for the sum under the ""General Elections to the 14th Lok Sabha"" head.

This, of course, is only the estimate of what the government will incur on the conduct of the polls. Political parties are, according to informed estimates, going to spend much more than Singh has earmarked for the actual conduct of the polls.

While the compression of the campaign schedule by the Election Commission should have brought down the expenses, indications are that the political parties which have planned ambitious propaganda campaigns will try to outspend each other.

While the government''s ""India Shining"" campaign has been dubbed a surrogate PR exercise for the BJP, the Congress is determined not to let the handicap of being in the Opposition interfere with its plan to match the saffron build-up in the media.

The principal Opposition party has decided to engage professional PR agencies - big names in the game - for its poll propaganda.

While the poll spend by the all-India players is ever-growing, the campaign budget of the regional players has also increased considerably with even the supposedly ""parties of the poor"" like Mayawati''s BSP, Mulayam Singh Yadav''s SP and Laloo Prasad Yadav''s RJD mounting big blitzes.

6,Rajan gangster arrested for threatening jailor,"MUMBAI: A Chhota Rajan gangster, who recently threatened jailor Swati Sathe of the Arthur Road jail in central Mumbai, was arrested by the Bandra unit of the crime branch on Monday.

The accused, Rafiq Hussain alias Gachhi, had threatened Ms Sathe with dire consequences as she had not allowed Rajan gangsters, lodged in the jail, to celebrate Chhota Rajan''s birthday on January 13.

Said inspector Vijay Salaskar, ""The Rajan men, including a key member D.K. Rao, wanted to bring a birthday cake and arrange for a musical programme in the jail.But Ms Sathe did not give them the permission.""

Gachhi, who was released from the jail about a month ago, called up Ms Sathe on her mobile phone and threatened her.

A complaint was registered at N.M. Joshi Marg police station in this connection. Acting on a tip-off that Gachhi would arrive in Bandra on Monday, a police team led by Mr Salaskar laid a trap and arrested him.

7,State govt wants a say in civil aviation policy,"HYDERABAD: The state government wants a say in the civil aviation policy. The Naresh Chandra Committee set up by the Centre on the civil aviation front is yet to finalise its draft.

The government feels that in the new policy the Centre should incorporate the views of fast moving states like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, which have taken up construction of greenfield airports.

Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has sent a letter to the Union civil aviation minister in this regard. Naidu, a strong advocate of the open sky policy, has been urging the Centre to free the skies from bureaucratic clutches.

This issue is likely to figure at Wednesday''s meeting between the state officials and the Union civil aviation minister in New Delhi. Naidu will also take up the issue with the Prime Minister.

The state government is of the view that the civil aviation policy always lays stress only on airlines, flight management, increasing the number of aircraft, air routes and so on and not on improving infrastructure facilities like construction of new airports, big and small.

In fact, the government wants important towns and cities in the state to be airlinked and is planning to invite some air operators to start services.

A private airliner, which recently started its operations in the state, is reportedly doing well and this has encouraged the government to negotiate with big operators to start air services in the state.

8,Tractor firms to harvest seeds of easy farm loans,"NEW DELHI: With finance minister Jaswant Singh announcing a host of sops for the farm sector including easing loan terms for farmers, the Indian tractor industry is finally hoping to untangle the weeds of dropping sales and till growth in the months to come.

Faced with two successive fiscals of 23 per cent negative growth, the tractor makers are hoping the relaxed loan terms, coupled with good monsoons earlier this fiscal, will help generate demand for the industry.

""We expect the Budget announcements to push growth for tractor makers even in the last two months of the fiscal and help the industry end the year on a positive note,"" says Ramesh C Jain, MD of Eicher Tractors.

Singh on Tuesday said the BJP government is committed to ensuring the availability of timely credit at affordable rates to farmers and other citizens of rural India. Banks have also been urged to provide loans for agricultural purposes at 9 per cent interest rate.

""The farm sector and the tractor industry has, for long, been hit by high interest rates. Since 95 per cent of the tractor purchases in the country are made on credit, these high interest rates had been hurting sales. With these relaxations, we expect a growth now,"" adds an official from M&M.

Soon after the Budget, the M&M scrip rose marginally even as the BSE Sensex shed over 74 points.

The bumper monsoon has fuelled growth in the sector and the industry ended the first nine months of the fiscal flat despite a 16 per cent drop in the first half.

""But sales in certain states are still negative. Despite this, we expect the industry to clock sales of 1,80,000 units this year,"" says Jain.

9,Shanta Kumar could be defeated in LS polls: Minister,"DHARAMSALA: The state forest minister said here on Wednesday that former Union Rural Development Minister Shanta Kumar could be defeated in the Lok Sabha elections likely to be held earlier than scheduled.

Addressing mediapersons, he said BJP rank and file was creating unnecessary hype by terming Shanta Kumar as unbeatable to boost its chances in the LS elections. He said if Shanta would have been so impregnable then how the BJP lost 14 of the assembly segments falling in the Kangra Parliamentary constituency in the assembly elections.

He said it was absurd that BJP was indulging in misplaced propaganda that it was holding great advantage in Chamba district falling in Kangra Parliamentary constituency despite the fact that it had suffered humiliating defeat in all the three segments of Chamba.

He said that secular parties should form their front to oust the communal forces adding that the situation had become alarming in the country. He said that the BJP, which was beating the drum of carrying coalition of more than one dozen parties, had ditched DMK, BSP and some other small groups. He said that Jayalalithaâ€™s AIDMK would also meet the same fate which was expected to join the NDA.

He ridiculed the BJP for indulging in propaganda that the Congress was struggling to find capable candidates for the LS polls. He claimed that party would announce the names of candidates having winnability potential at an appropriate time.

Kumar also stressed the need for revamping the PCC adding that various posts in the PCC, which had fallen vacant due to resignation by ministers complying to norm of one man, one post had not been filled so far. He said all the vacant posts in the PCC should be filled up to make for the vaccum created in the set-up of PCC.

The state forest minister also emphasized the need for taking back some of the independent MLAs owing allegiance to the party. He said that these MLAs had to leave the party in the situation arising out of the faulty distribution of tickets in some of the assembly segments but added that past should be buried and they be taken back in the party fold.

11,BJP to grill Mulayam govt on law and order,"LUCKNOW: After a stormy beginning, the budget session of the State Legislature promises a lot of fireworks as the main opposition party BJP has decided to disrupt proceedings till the Mulayam government holds a debate on deteriorating law and order situation, sugarcane dues and denotification of districts.

Significantly, the BJP is all set to saffronise the state politics by raking up Hindutva in the wake of Lok Sabha polls. the party has also decided to take up the issue of how temples/ maths were being targeted and Sadhus killed under Mulayam regime.

A decision to this effect was taken after the BJP legislature party meeting on Wednesday evening. During the meeting, members of the BJPLP chalked out a strategy to grill the Mulayam government on these issues.

Four members of the Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP), which announced its merger with the BJP on Tuesday, stayed away from the meeting. ""The merger process was yet to be completed. Moreover, Kalyan Singhji was in Delhi today,"" clarified a senior BJP leader.

The BJPLP Leader and leader of opposition in the UP Assembly Lalji Tandon said that BJP''s stand was vindicated on deteriorating law and order and denotification of districts. ""Murder of PM''s kin, kidnapping of CM''s nephew and abduction of 14 persons in a single day from chief minister''s hometown Etawah speak volumes about the lawlessness in the state. High Court stay order has vindicated our stand on denotification of districts,"" claimed Tandon.

""The party has collected datas from its legislators and district units. Figures are shocking and would expose the Mulayam government in the eyes of the public,"" disclosed Tandon.

The BJPLP leader said that the party would raise the issue of killings of ten Sadhus in Eastern part of the state. ""There was sudden spurt in smuggling of statues of Hindu deities which were being stolen from ancient temples in different parts of the state,"" alleged Tandon charging the Mulayam government of giving protection to anti-socials. ""In Jaunpur, the district administrtaion has gone on record saying that statues were safer in treasury than in temples,"" he charged.

BJPLP members also discussed bringing a no-confidence motion against the state government. ""We are in touch with other opposition groups and if they agree the BJP won''t mind bringing a no-confidence motion,"" stated Tandon.

12,NRI investment fails to pick up in Gujarat,"GANDHINAGAR: The big non-resident Gujarati (NRG) show during the recent kite-flying festival cannot hide the hard reality that the non-resident Indians (NRIs) have so far been rather shy while investing in Gujarat. The official figures, made available from a top Sachivalaya source, suggest that of the 18,794.90 crore total foreign direct investment (FDI) in the state till November 2003 ever since the new economic policy began in August 1991, the NRI share is a mere 4 per cent.

The figures, which the industries department has been keeping under the carpet, suggest that the state attracted just 88 NRI-sponsored FDI projects worth Rs 756.53 crore. This comes to just 7.07 per cent of the country as a whole -- Rs 10,705.20 crore NRI investment. Andhra Pradesh tops the list with 190 projects worth Rs 1,905.77 crore of NRIs'' FDI investment, or 17.80 per cent of India as a whole.

Then it is Maharashtra with 273 NRI projects with Rs 1,890.70 crore of FDI investment (17.66%), Karnataka with 163 projects for 1,332.99 crore (12.45%), Delhi with 140 projects for 959.53 crore (8.96%) and Tamil Nadu 192 projects for Rs 683.34 crore (6.38%).

Official figures on foreign projects suggest, the state is No 5 in total FDI approvals (both NRI and non-NRI) -- Maharashtra tops the list with Rs 50,333.44 crore (17.38%), followed by Delhi''s Rs 34,635.87 crore (11.96%), Tamil Nadu''s Rs 24,763.24 crore (8.55%), Karnataka''s 23,969.95 crore (8.27%), and Gujarat''s 18,794.90 crore (6.49%). ""This suggests that the state may be on top in industrial investment, but when in FDI, it has far to go"", commented a top bureaucrat.

Giving complete details of all the 88 NRI projects approved for Gujarat, from where have they come and for which sector, the official source suggests, seven projects worth Rs 250.92 crore, or 33.17 per cent of the total NRI investments, are in the metallurgical sector, followed by drugs and pharmaceuticals (eight projects for Rs 141.23 crore -- 18.67 per cent) and textiles including dyes and prints (nine projects for 128.41 crore -- 16.97 per cent).

During the Vibrant Gujarat investment summit in September-end last year, the state made much propaganda on how NRIs were being attracted in the tourism sector. But the figures suggest that so far just four projects worth Rs 2.49 crore have got attracted here. The situation with telecommuncations is even worse -- just one project worth Rs 1.49 crore. Food processing is slightly better with five projects worth 9.8 crore.

No doubt, there has been some dent in 2003 towards providing FDI approvals to the NRIs. Figures suggest, in all six projects were approved last year worth Rs 218.44 crore. The highest number of project approvals to the NRIs was in 1996. That year, 19 projects were approved, though the amount was considerably low, just 69.29 crore. Similarly though 16 projects were approved in 1995, eleven in 1993, eight in 114 and as many as 1998, the amount was rather small.

Interestingly, none of the 2003 projects are in the tourism or hotels sector. The 2003 approvals list suggests that three of the six approvals were in the real estate or construction, one related in the manufacture of gas meter, one for manufacturing drugs and medicines and yet another for data communication and support service. The drugs and manufacturing project and one of the construction projects alone accounted to NRI FDI investment worth Rs 215.01 crore out or Rs 218.44 crore last year.

14,Cong gears up front outfits for polls,"CHANDIGARH: In a run up to the Lok Sabha elections, Punjab Congress is gearing itself and its frontal organisation which had been lying dormant for months.

Incidentally, the party youth wing is in shambles and its student wing- the National Student Union of India (NSUI)- has been headless and without any proper organisation in the state.

Conceding that Punjab Youth Congress and NSUI state units needed to be galvanised, Punjab Congress chief H S Hanspal said that soon the state presidents of both the frontal organisations would be appointed so that these could contribute to the success of the party.

Indications are that the party would opt for non-jat leaders for the coveted posts as already the CM, deputy CM and president of the Mahila Congress are jats. Gurkanwal Kaur, daughter of late Beant Singh, would continue to be chief of Mahila Congress. Earlier, she was tipped to be a minister and her slot in the Mahila Congress would have fallen vacant too. But since the proposal of cabinet expansion has been shelved, Gurkanwal won''t be disturbed though party was anxious to replace her by some young woman.

To mobilise the rank and file, the Congress has convened party convention on February 10 to 12 in three district where the activists of the adjoining district too would participate. The all India general secretary and in charge Punjab Mohsina Kidwai would address the conventions which would be attended by all the MLAs, MPs, ex-MLAs, MPs, party''s district units and other leaders.

Hanspal said that the details of the programme are yet to be worked out. Stating the objective of the meeting, Hanspal said the party would take stock of its strength and weakness in the districts and take corrective steps to ensure victory of the party. Also, these conventions would mobilise the rank and file.

The proposed conventions have at least made it clear that Hanspal would continue to head the party till the Lok Sabha elections. Insiders said any change of the Congress leadership would have led to changes down to the block level which the party could hardly afford at this juncture- close to the Lok Sabha polls and hence proposal to replace him too has been deferred.

15,Maharaja to sleep easy till polls,"NEW DELHI: Air-India has got a fresh lease of life, at least for the time being, with the Cabinet deferring a decision on the proposal to open up the foreign skies â€” minus the Gulf â€” for domestic carriers.

With its mega $2 billion fleet acquisition proposal still miles away from take-off, fresh competition from the likes of Jet Airways and Air Sahara would have led to a dent in the carrierâ€™s profitability.

""Since the private carriers do not have to go through the exercise of government approvals and endless rounds of meetings before buying planes, they could have easily expanded fleet and mounted services in competition with A-I in the West,"" a government official said.

Whatâ€™s worse, the backbone of A-Iâ€™s balance-sheet â€” bilateral earnings â€” would have crumbled. While the government had no intention of taking away A-Iâ€™s Rs 300-odd crore revenue from unused bilaterals, the airline would have not been able to earn more from any future bilateral agreements.

Even without touching those earnings, some political parties and even sections within the BJP-led government felt the move to open the skies would have led to an erosion in A-Iâ€™s market value in case of a sell-off in the future.

That said, the airline still has to start thinking of life without this extra income, given the rate at which the civil aviation sector is being liberalised. A-I will have pull up its socks and improve marketshare to remain an attractive proposition for future buyers.

As for private domestic carriers, they will now have to be content with flying only to the Saarc countries. While terming the deferment as ""a setback for the nation"", Air Sahara CEO Uttam Kumar Bose said the domestic airlines were now waiting for the ministry of civil aviation to finalise the finer modalities regarding routes and slots for operating in the Saarc region. ""We are ready to mount flights to Saarc, and will start as soon as the formal notification comes,"" he said.
