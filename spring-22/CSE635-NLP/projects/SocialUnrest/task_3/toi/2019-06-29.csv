Over 3000 supporters, led by Maulana Jawwad, were intercepted near the Asifi Imambara when they took to the streets in a massive procession, marching towards Vidhan Bhawan after the Friday prayers. In another procession, taken out from near the Capitol theatre, Maulana Sadiq courted arrest along with thousands of his supporters who were taken to the Reserve Police Lines and detained. They were later released by the district authorities.

â€œWe had already announced that we would march up to the Vidhan Bhawan and stage a demonstration to press for our demand of dissolving the Shia Waqf Board,â€� Jawwad said, talking to Times News Network.

He said that last year a memorandum was handed over to the Prime Minister Vajpayee during one of his visits here. â€œThe PM then assured that he would get the matter inquired and initiate action,â€� Jawwad said, adding that he again met the PM in New Delhi to press for his demand when nothing came forth after months. On June 13 last the two Shia clerics handed over a memorandum in this regard to the Chief Minister Mayawati and accorded a fortnightâ€™s time to the government to act. The 15-day deadline expired of Thursday and the protests were staged on Friday afternoon accordingly.

The two clerics said that there were mass irregularities in the working of the Shia Waqf Board and Maulana Kalbe Sadiq had even filed a writ petition before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, seeking appointment of a commission of inquiry in this regard. The High Court had even appointed Justice UC Srivastava, a retired High Court judge, but the state government, they say, filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court against the HC order.

The protesting cleric had sought dissolution of the board and appointment of a senior IAS officer as the administrator or controller till a new waqf board is constituted, finalising action against complaints of misappropriation and speedy completion of investigations into criminal cases lodged by complainants.

1,EC amends rules for poll candidates,"NEW DELHI: With the Union government declining to proceed in the matter for the time being, the Election Commission of India went ahead on Friday and enforced the May 2 order of the Supreme Court on compelling poll candidates to disclose various personal details, such as pending and previous cases and convictions, wealth and income of self, spouse and dependents.

Anyone wishing to contest a parliamentary or assembly poll will now have to file on affidavit, details of his wealth (bank balance, cash, property, jewellery, shares, bonds, loan dues to government bodies, etc), and that of spouse and dependents.

Besides, details of any prior criminal cases, convictions or acquittals and any pending cases that carry a sentence of two or more years, have to be mentioned together with educational qualifications.

This information will be made freely available to the media, the public and to rival candidates. The new order, adds the ECI, will also apply to Jammu and Kashmir, which has a separate Constitution and is going to polls shortly.

The Supreme Court had stipulated June 28 as the last date for enforcing its order, but the judges had created an interesting situation in doing so - the authority to prescribe and amend poll contest rules rests, under law, with the government, but the apex court''s directive was issued to the EC.

Hence, on May 14, after lengthy discussion with his colleagues, Chief Election Commissioner James Lyngdoh had written to Union law minister Arun Jaitley on a way out.

He wanted the government to issue an order amending the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, which prescribes the format of nomination papers to Parliament and state legislatures, to incorporate the SC directive as it was not something the EC could do.

After all, said Lyngdoh, the SC directive had to be so enforced as to obviate future legal challenge.

2,Hurriyat opposes Central rule in J&K,"SRINAGAR: The All-Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC) on Friday said that the imposition of the President''s rule in Jammu and Kashmir during the Assembly elections would not serve any purpose.

Speaking to Times News Network, Abdul Gani Bhat, chairman of the 13-party conglomerate, said their main objective was the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.

He was reacting to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s comment, earlier in the day in Lucknow, that the elections would be free and fair, and the government might even consider imposing Central rule during the period.

The suggestion has, however, found favour with mainstream politicians in the state and the local people.

5,"No funds to bail out HPL, says govt","KOLKATA: The West Bengal government may find it difficult to bail out its dream project, the Haldia Petrochemicals, because of its own financial constraints, a senior state government official indicated in Kolkata on Friday.

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, however, said there was no problem in HPL and talks were proceeding well with Indian Oil on the latterâ€™s equity participation in the company.

The state government will sit down with HPL chairman Tarun Das after he returns from abroad.

The state had often helped the HPL with funds to meet its interest payment requirements, the official said.

So far, a total of Rs 1,800 crore of interest dues have been repaid by the HPL. But, in the cur-rent quarter, the HPL is finding it difficult to service its debts because it had to spend a lot on the purchase of naphtha.

The state will not have any objection if IOC takes over controlling stakes in HPL, the official indicated. â€œBut, they must do it earlyâ€� The IOC had earlier sought 26 per cent equity and management control in HPL. Now it reportedly wants a majority stake.

â€œIt is for Purnendu Chatterjee to decide if he wants to give IOC majority stake as we have decided to hand over controlling shares to him,â€� the official said.

He indicated that the price at which shares of HPL would exchange hands could be one of the contentious issues in the deal with IOC.

Bringing in fresh equity is important for HPL because this will reduce the debt and the interest burden.

There was an unforeseen increase in debt because the HPL could not go for a public issue.

7,Unemployment biggest challenge before govt: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Identifying unemployment as the biggest challenge before the government, Home Minister L K Advani on Saturday said the Centre had launched several projects to generate additional job opportunities in the country.

""It may be comparatively easy to provide irrigation facilities to farmers, but it is a difficult to provide job to each hand,"" he said, inaugurating a ''Housing Mela'' organised by Delhi Development Authority at Dwarka sub-city on the outskirts of the Capital.

Advani said the NDA government had selected projects which could ensure maximum employment opportunities and construction of roads across the country was one of them.

While it was important to link villages to towns with good roads and to provide housing for all, the best feature of these projects was that it provided employment to millions of jobless, he said.

Advani said that for the sake of country''s all round progress, people should stop looking at flaws in each and everything. They should rather appreciate the positive things.

Stating that self-confidence among the people was the main strength of a country, he said a nation could not grow by indulging in criticism alone.

Referring to the importance of internal and external security, he said, ""our enemies are afraid of us"". He, however, did not elaborate.

Underlining the need for eradicating corruption, he said if people at the top are honest, its good effect will reach the bottom. He also asked people to shun personal ambition.

Advani lauded the efforts of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for carrying out their work efficiently.

He also handed over possession letters to some allottees at the function. DDA released 6,500 houses in various categories on Saturday.

Speaking as the chief guest, Urban Development Minister Ananth Kumar said 25,000 new houses were likely to be distributed by DDA by 2003 and by 2004 all the backlog was expected to be cleared.

He said that the government was trying its best to provide housing for all by 2010 as promised by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

9,No dialogue with govt on Babri issue: Imam,"NEW DELHI: Asserting that the Babri Masjid dispute could only be solved by court, the Shahi Imama of Jama Masjid, Maulana Sayed Ahmed Bukhari, on Saturday ruled out any dialogue with the government or Hindu organisations and said that Muslims had not authorised any individual to take part in any talks on the issue. Reacting sharply to the statement of the newly elected president of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Rabey Hasani Nadvi expressing his willingness to negotiate with the Kanchi Shankracharya on the Ayodhya issue, the Imam said in a statement here ""the community did not authorise any Muslim leader or organisation, including the Board, for negotiations on the issue"". Questioning the authority of the Board to negotiate on the issue, the Imam said ""the solution of this issue is possible only in courts"". He accused the VHP and other communal forces of trying to confuse the issue in guise of negotiations. ""It was their obstinate stand which had foiled all attempts to solve the issue through negotiations made by the Babri Masjid Action Committee in the past,"" he alleged. On Shankracharya's statement that the issue would be resolved within three months, the Imam said that it should be made clear with whom the negotiations were going on. He also asked the Shankracharya to pay attention to the condition of Muslims who fell victim to recent communal riots in Gujarat, the statement said.

10,CM brushes aside rumblings within party,"MYSORE/BANGALORE: Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Saturday brushed aside resentment being expressed by some of the dropped ministers, saying``statements of these leaders do not warrant any reaction from me.''''

Speaking to reporters here, Krishna said the issue is being blown out of proportion. He declined to comment on former minister S.R. Kashappanavar questioning his ``Congressness.''''

On Friday, Kashappanavar had told this newspaper that while Krishna had joined the Congress from the Praja Socialist Party, he was a dyed in the wool Congressman. ``There is no need to recommend to the high command any disciplinary action against Kashappanavar,'''' Krishna added.

The CM denied that at least four of the five dropped ministers owed their allegiance to a senior minister from north Karnataka. ``How do individuals matter in a reshuffle? Only after consultation and prior permission from the high command these ministers were dropped.''''

On 41 first-time legislators being unhappy over not being included, Krishna felt they have a point to raise. ``But there is no need for me to redress their grievance as the party high command did not want first-timers in the cabinet.''''

``Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee is going to reshuffle his cabinet soon. Let us see whether it will be free from such criticisms and outbursts,'''' he added.

In Bangalore, Water Resources Minister H.K. Patil''s camp claimed that 16 MLAs and five MLCs had called to express solidarity with him. Patil is reportedly unhappy about A.M. Hindasgeri, S.R. Kashappanavar, B.B. Chimanakatti and Veerakumar A. Patil being dropped and V.S. Koujalgi, his rival, inducted into the cabinet.

However, Veerakumar Patil maintained that though he was upset of being dropped, he had reconciled himself to it. ``I am a Congressman and will abide by whatever the high command says. I am not used to controversies,'''' he added.

Sources said Koujalgi met Veerakumar Patil as both hail from Belgaum and the latter fell at the new agriculture minister''s feet. Koujalgi met Congress leaders in Delhi on Saturday to thank them for his induction in the cabinet.
