0,Kumar to frame 'save water' policy,"PUNE: Municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar has announced the framing of a policy which will ensure â€œjudicious useâ€� of the available stock of drinking water in the city till the next monsoon.

The pre-emptive step has been mooted to conserve water, considering the droughtlike situation in rural areas of the district and the possibility of the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) restricting water supply to the city from the Khadakwasla dam.

The move assumes significance considering that hitherto, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had challenged the MKVDC whenever it had recommended a water cut in Pune.

Although this time round, the MKVDC has not asked the PMC to adopt any such measure, the civic body has decided to initiate some preemptive measures on its own.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar had on Tuesday told MKVDC, collectorate and zilla parishad officials to accord top priority to providing drinking water to drought-affected areas in Pune and adjoining districts and advised farmers against cultivating sugarcane,which needs large quantity of water.

In this backdrop, several NCP corporators, led by Rajlaxmi Bhosale, on Wednesday demanded that the civic general body frame a policy for water conservation. Interestingly, corporators from all political parties supported their demand. So much so that they demanded a cut in water supply to the cityâ€™s slums â€” their vote banks! Kumar lauded the stand taken by the corporators and assured that water supply to slum areas, most of which receive uninterrupted water for 20 to 24 hours, will be curtailed. The administration is considering supplying water to the slums only for three hours in the morning and three hours in the evening, he added.

Kumar said he will soon table a policy before the party leaders in the PMC, spelling out the long-term and short-term measures to be taken to conserve water.

The short-term measures will include curtailing water supply to slums and other city pockets and stringent action against those using tap water for washing vehicles and gardening.

The long-term measures include upgradation of the water distribution network and replacement of old water lines. Besides, the administration will make rainwater harvesting compulsory for construction coming up in the fringe areas, where the PMC is yet to develop a water supply network.

The administration will also moot a proposal to make it mandatory on big housing societies to set up water recycling plants on their premises, so that the recycled water could be used for gardening and in toilets, Kumar said.â€�

1,Police govt's domestic servant: DGP,"MUZAFFARPUR: Director general of police D P Ojha said here on Wednesday that the status of the police force has been merely reduced to that of a domestic servant of the government since there has been no requisite amendment in the police manual in the post-Independent India.

The police were not free during the British rule and even today they are not being given a free hand to deal with criminals, he said.

While participating in a seminar organised by the National Service Scheme (NSS) of BRA Bihar University, the DGP admitted that many malpractices and irregularities had crept into the police department. However, he claimed that it were only the police which could pave the way for development by ensuring peace in the society. Police need suitable circumstances, powers and resources to perform their duties as per the rule of law, he said.

The DGP said that todayâ€™s democracy is not â€œforâ€� the general people. It is for a few people who have got the ruling powers. It is also for their relatives. The democracy as well as the government are for hardly 15 per cent of the population. The definition of the rule of law and democracy has changed. These 15 per cent â€œpowerfulâ€� people do not consider themselves to be covered by the rule of law, he said.

Practically speaking, the rural population has not been given any importance by the government. Their economic plight has not yet improved substantially. Transfer of power to the rural populace has remained only on paper, he said.

Referring to the academic field, the DGP felt that the mass exodus of students from Bihar is only due to the deteriorating academic standards and environment in the state. The government would have to involve the general people in the activities of universities.

The government has no fund to spend on salaries of university teachers and therefore it cannot spare any amount for research activities. No university in Bihar can compete with others without making education purposeful, he said.

Being a former student of BRA Bihar University, Ojha enjoyed the company of his fellow students on the occasion.

He planted a sapling in LS College where he was felicitated by vice chancellor NNP Singh and college principal Pandey.

Earlier, VC Singh and NSS coordinator Arun Kumar Singh welcomed the DGP. A few entertaining programmes were also presented by NSS volunteers on the occasion.

2,Women's forum moves HC against minister,"PATNA: The left parties, RJD and womenâ€™s fora have demanded the resignation of junior Union minister Sanjay Paswan. They have alleged that Paswan has honoured and glorified gunis, ojhas and bhagats. The Mahila Jagran Kendra has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Patna High Court against the ministerâ€™s action.

State unit of the CPI, CPI(ML), RJD and womenâ€™s fora, including Mahila Jagran Kendra and AIPWA, have charged Paswan of violating the provisions of the Prevention of Witchcraft Practices Act, 1999, of Bihar.

CPI secretary Jalauddin Ansari said that it was unfortunate that persons, who take oath in the name of Constitution, are violating it. By honouring exorcists, sorcerers and witch doctors and accompanying them at a meet in the state capital is violation of Section 51 of the Constitution, which specifically mentions that development of scientific temper is every citizenâ€™s right. He also urged the state government to book the minister under the Anti-Witchcraft Act.

RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav has also demanded sacking of the minister for violating the law. The ministerâ€™s act simply reflected the hypocrisy of the BJP, Yadav alleged. Filing a PIL on behalf of the Mahila Jagran Kendra, lawyer Ibrahim Kabir said the most unfortunate aspect was that while the President stressed the need for development of scientific temper, the junior Union minister is spreading superstition among the people in open violation of the Constitution.

Earlier, at a function to mark the birth anniversary of former Bihar CM the late Bhola Paswan Shastri on September 22, the minister honoured ojhas, gunis, vaidyas, pandas, pirs and bhagats.

He also walked barefoot on embers, brandishing sword, much to the delight of the audience.

President of the state unit of the International Association of Peopleâ€™s Lawyers Shruti Singh and secretary Neelu said that they had to file a PIL in the court as neither the Gandhi Maidan police station nor the district authorities concerned took any initiative on their complaint against the minister.

3,Raja still rules the roost,"KUNDA: From Raghuraj Pratap Singh to ""history-sheeter No 163 A, Raja Bhaiyya alias Toofan Singh"", as the dossier in the Kunda kotwali describes him, it has been a long journey, indeed, for the former minister for sports and youth affairs.

Six months of solitary confinement may have changed him or so he claims, but nothing has apparently changed in Kunda the dusty little township in Pratapgarh which his family has ruled over generations.

His name still evokes extreme reactions as you can either love or hate Raja Bhaiyya. The promised release of the Pota detenue has predictably led to two camps, one waiting eagerly for the arrival of their much-wronged hero and the other which prophecies troubled times ahead fearing the Raja will go on a score-settling spree.

However, majority of people like the retired school master Surendra Pratap Singh would rather keep mum.

""If I celebrate his release then I become a target of witch hunt by Mayawati and her officers as and when she comes back to power and criticising Raja Saab would be equally bad,"" he wearily explained.

""It is a fight between two political heavyweights, Raja Bhaiyya and Mayawati,"" said Ramadhar Dubey, an employee in court. ""Naturally, people would rather keep their distance,"" he added.

However, his critics are quick to launch a no-holds barred attack. Aftar Hussain, a petrol pump owner and a trusted aide of Ratan Singh, Congress MP and Raja''s sworn enemy, termed the ""promised release by Mulayam as the biggest blunder made by him so far"".

The siren of his car at the station would have people lie prostrate on roads, he declared quite dramatically. So his freedom, Hussain declared, spelled trouble.

Akhilendra Singh, a distant relative of Raja, fears for his safety as he had taken the contract for Ambedkar bird sanctuary, Raja''s property acquired by the UP government. While Ram Lakhan Yadav, a JD leader, saluted Mayawati for ""cracking her whip at the most deserving man"".

The whip has made quite an impact, though. Attendants in Benti Palace, Raja Bhaiyya''s sprawling ancestral home, ran inside upon spotting a car as the TOI team approached the palace and resurfaced after half an hour after much cajoling and explanation.

""We thought you were police,"" said a a visibly shaken Ram Naresh, the old retainer. Mithu, his young trainee, narrated how policemen would raid the palace any time and beat them black and blue. ""They drove us out and we could only sneak in at night to feed the pet animals,"" he recalled.

Mahesh Kumar narrated how a police officer broke the leg of a colt and freed all dogs and cows and even yanked off the telephone line. ""Even women workers were not spared. Thank God it shall soon be over,"" he said.

The welcome found its echo in Kunda collectorate where dozens of lawyers in unison chortled how nice it was to have the Raja back once again. Sripal, a litigant, talked glowingly about the ""maharajaji"" who had sponsored his daughter''s wedding last year.

""Raja Bhaiyya is little hot-headed but, then, he is also magnanimous. I would rather bow to him than before local goons,"" declared Mohammd Islam, a dhaba owner.

Meanwhile, the ""big purge"" has begun in Kunda. Circle officer Kunda has been transferred and so was the district magistrate Mohammad Mustafa. In the deserted Kotwali, sub-inspector RN Pandey tried to make light of his worries. ""No option, I am not an IAS officer to get commando for my safety,"" he quipped.

""Tell me where did we go wrong?"" he asked. ""The CM told the DGP and the buck stopped only at the Kunda kotwali. What else could we do? We also have a family to feed after all,"" he argued.

Pandey showed police records where Udai Pratap Singh and Raja Bhaiyya had against them 50 and 39 cases, respectively, of mainly dacoity, murder and abduction. The former, according to the records, is even shown as the gang leader with 105 accomplices!

So Pandey now looks forward to a transfer. ""However, they will not find it easy to find my replacement this time,"" he smirked with satisfaction.

4,Compensation for farmers,"LUCKNOW: The government has directed the district magistrates of the flood-hit districts to provide assistance to the affected farmers before the sowing of rabi crop starts.

According to relief commissioner AK Singh, compensation would be given at the rate of Rs 2,500 per hectares, if 50 per cent of the crop was damaged. In the unirrigated areas, a compensation of Rs 1,000 per hectares would be awarded, he further said. In the event of damage to cash crops, the compensation amount would be raised to Rs 4,000 per hectares, he added.

Singh further added that the farmers could be given a compensation of Rs 10, 000 per hectares, if their crops were damaged due to erosion of land caused by the changing of the course of the rivers.

5,Farmers irked with Modi govt over power hike,"GANDHINAGAR: At a well-attended rally here in Gandhinagar, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) on Thursday declared a war against the Narendra Modi government for its refusal to bring down the nearly 250 per cent hike in the power tariff imposed on farmers two months ago.

Several speakers attacked the Chief Minister for failing to bring down the hike by 50 per cent despite its promise to do so. The rally ended by resolving to take the support of all MLAs and MPs for their demand on September 27.

""We would declare those MLAs and MPs not supporting us as Garudias (puppies)"", declared senior BKS leader Mangalbhai Uperia announcing the next programme of action at the end of the rally.

""We have known Hajurias (sycophants), Khajurias (the 1997 BJP rebels who went to Khajuraho) and Majurias (slaves). Now we will know who all are Garudias. Many of them are so servile and fearful, they would not to displease Narendra Modi even on this,"" he said.

The rally was called ''Kisan Mahakumbh'' against the ''Asuras''.

Not sparing the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat business summit, state BKS president Prafull Senjalia criticised Modi for following in the footsteps of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru by giving more importance to industry than agriculture.

""It seems, the Nehruvian ghost has begun bugging Narendra Modi,"" he said. ""It is unfortunate, he does not even remember the farmers today. He shouldn''t forget, he will not remain in power if he does not listen to us. We form 70 per cent of the electorate.""

Lending his support to the farmers of other organisations who have been protesting against the hike, Senjalia underlined, ""One must remember what happened in Vadodara. The farmers there had come to protest against the hike. Yet they were badly beaten up. We are with them. There is little reason why we should not unite and fight against the hike.""

There was a significant effort to distance the BKS from the BJP, even though both are known parts of the Sangh Parivar. Said state BKS general secretary Maganbhai Patel, ""We are a non-political organisation. There have been attempts to divide farmers along political lines. These should be repudiated. Some call us a child of the BJP. We are not the child of the BJP but the BJP is our child. We have elected the MLAs.""

6,Anomalies in defence travel rules,"KOLKATA: For those who had formulated travel rules for the defence services, the figure 1,450 seems to hold a special fascination.

For, 1,450 km is the maximum distance a service officer can travel on leave with free conveyance allowance, according to the travel regulations for defence services.

Under the travel rules, an officer proceeding on annual leave can avail of the facility of travelling on warrant to his home town along with his family irrespective of distance once in a block of two years. In the other year, he and his family are entitled to a free conveyance, but with the limit on distance.

Distances which service officers cover while proceeding on leave are often much more than the maximum stipulated, service officers in Kolkata point out. ""For, when proceeding on leave, most service officers prefer to go to their home towns as they have to stay away from home for long periods.""

The distance, for instance, by train between Jammu and Kanyakumari is about 3,750 km, while that between Guwahati and Trivandram is about 3,580 km, according to a railway official.

""There is an anomaly here. One posted near his home town is at an advantage, one who is far off suffers,"" a service officer says. Officers with hometown in one of selected hill stations, too, have an advantage, as they can avail of a hill station warrant on leave.

For a long time after Independence, the maximum distance which one could travel on leave with conveyance was 950 km, source say. This, however, was a British legacy which the services had inherited. Later, the maximum distance was increased to 1,450 km.

The 950 km norm prevailing in Britain had been enforced in India during the raaj without adapting them to the conditions of the country. According to information available from the British deputy high commission in Kolkata, the maximum distance in the UK, lengthwise, is just under 1,000 kms while breadth wise it is about 500 km.

7,Social watch report 2003 keeps an eye on law making bodies,"BANGALORE: Karnataka needs a new human development report to assess development in the state since the last report in 1999, Lokayukta vigilance director for social welfare, health and education, Dr H Sudarshan said here on Thursday.

Speaking at a forum to discuss the recently released ''Social Watch India Report - 2003'' Dr Sudarshan said such reports must not merely adorn almirahs but its findings must be translated to bring changes for the people.

The Social Watch India report -2003 is part of a citizens initiative to monitor governance in India and has been put together by a national social watch coalition.

It looks at the performance of the parliament, the executive, the Supreme Court and local governance.

The report states that there as many as 3,640,870 cases pending in high courts across the country and nearly 20 million cases in subordinate courts.

In the parliament, the social composition of the houses have witnessed a transformation with the number of professionals - teachers, doctors etc. - dwindling from 51 per cent that existed in early years after independence, the report has stated.

Attendance in parliamentary committees is also fast declining and a source for concern, the report says.

According to one of the authors of the report, Jagadananda, President APJ Abdul Kalam has asked for a report on the usage of MLA and MP funds.

8,Vajpayee slams Pak's politics of blackmail,"UNITED NATIONS: India will not talk to Pakistan as long as it uses terrorism as a tool of blackmail, Prime Minister Vajpayee told the United Nations on Thursday.

UNITED NATIONS: India will not talk to Pakistan as long as it uses terrorism as a tool of blackmail, Prime Minister Vajpayee told the United Nations on Thursday.

In the bluntest, most public rejection yet of Pakistan''s attempt to force talks on the Kashmir issue, Vajpayee said, ""We totally refuse to let terrorism become a tool of blackmail. Just as the world did not negotiate with al-Qaeda or the Taliban, we shall not negotiate with terrorism.""

He prefaced the rejection by pointing out that the Pakistani President has made a public admission for the first time before the UN on Wednesday that ""Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir."" After claiming that there is an indigenous struggle in Kashmir, he (Musharraf) has offered to encourage a general cessation of violence within Kashmir, in return for ""reciprocal obligations and restraints.""

In effect, Vajpayee suggested, Musharraf was using terrorism to force India to the negotiating table. Talking to Pakistan under the circumstances would be betraying the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who had defied a most ferocious campaign of violence and intimidation sponsored from across the border and participated in an election which has been universally hailed as free and fair, he said.

The election was an unequivocal expression of both determination and self-determination, he added.

""When the cross-border terrorism stops - or when we eradicate it - we can have a dialogue with Pakistan on the other issues between us,"" Vajpayee, who spoke in Hindi, offered.

Vajpayee also mocked Musharraf''s shrill attempt during his US visit to seek parity with India saying ""he should not confuse the legitimate aspiration for equality of nations with outmoded concepts of military parity.""

Indian officials have said it is ludicrous that Pakistan should seek any sort of parity with a country that is seven times larger gerographically, ten times bigger economically, and an entirely different security and strategic orientation.

Without naming Pakistan, Vajpayee also implicitly criticised the international community for not extending the war against terrorism beyond Afghanistan into Pakistan.

""Some of its members are themselves part of the problem,"" Vajpayee said in an unstated reference to Pakistan. ""We are sometimes led into semantics about the definition of terrorism. The search for ''root causes'' or imaginary ''freedom struggles'' provide alibis for the killing of innocent men, women and children,"" he told the General Assembly.

No state should be allowed to profess partnership with the global coalition against terror, while continuing to aid, abet and sponsor terrorism. To condone such double standards is to contribute to multiplying terrorism, he warned.

Vajpayee''s tough speech came after a week of hectoring statements by Gen. Musharraf, including in his UN address on Wednesday, portraying India as a party reluctant to talk to Pakistan. Musharraf himself was not in New York for Vajpayee''s response, having left for Canada on a bilateral visit.

The tone of exchanges during the torrid week in New York now appears to have put even more distance between India and Pakistan after a brief period of hope.

9,New Education policy seeks greater private role,"AHMEDABAD: Notwithstanding the bitter tug-of-war between the self-financed institutes offering professional courses and the state government, vis-a-vis admissions this year, the Gujarat government plans to woo investors to further privatise the education sector.

The plan is likely to be tabled during the education session of the â€˜Vibrant Gujaratâ€™ summit beginning September 28.

Secretary of higher education P Panneervel who has been instrumental in formulating the new policy, said that private participation was crucial as Gujarat continued to lag behind, compared to its neighbours, in offering job-oriented courses that had led to an exodus of students from the state.

â€œOn September 30, the government will be holding an education convention which will be chaired by the chief minister. The thrust of the new education policy will be to encourage the industry to participate in higher education. Private players can set up their own universities, so that they can enjoy complete autonomy in functioning,â€� he told TNN.

He pointed out that the idea behind inviting industry to participate in higher education was that it will be able to assist educational institutions in developing quality infrastructure and sensitize universities about its manpower requirements.

Approval provided to self-financed engineering, medical and management education institutes and granting university status to privately-run colleges backed by corporate houses such as Nirma and Reliance at Ahmedabad are seen to be a step towards opening an era of private sector participation in financing and managing institutions of higher education.

Ask him if setting up of more private colleges will cause more friction as was witnessed this year, he says, â€œWith increasing appreciation for the quality of education, more number of students and their parents are ready to pay the price.â€�

He said, the government had already organised a seminar with industry leaders such as CII and FICCI earlier during the year. â€œIn the seminar, suggestions were mooted to have members of these two bodies in panel of universities and academic councils, who can suggest which relevant courses to introduce and which redundant courses be scrapped,â€� he added.

For instance, he said, the state provides vast potential for setting up of new educational institutes in the areas of marine engineering, port management, gems and jewellery design, disaster management and biotechnology that will be able to serve market needs.

However, players who have already set up self-financed institutes in the state, mock at governmentâ€™s new policy. â€œContrary to the expectation that the government will appreciate and support the initiatives taken by private education trusts, it has been putting hurdles in the form of numerous notifications aimed at imposing controls,â€� remarked chairman of all self-financed technical institutes in the state, CL Patel.

But the government is all set to market its higher education policy during the forthcoming business summit. The official Vibrant Gujarat website not only enunciates the new policy of higher education, but also lists among the projects put up for investment, an ambitious plan to set up an education park with investment pegged at US$20 million (Rs 1000 million).

The educational park will provide common infrastructure and flexibility at institution level, to the private sector and will be spread over about 700 acre.

The park would develop plots which will be transferred to corporates and trusts that want to establish educational institutions. The investors will be simply be required to develop their academic building. The park would be planned to house at least 10 to 12 such institutions covering various faculties.

10,Parivar's developmental concept dubbed communal,"BANGALORE: The Sangh Parivar''s concept of ""comprehensive development"" was unnecessarily being dubbed ""communal"" by other political parties, union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday.

Addressing a gathering of RSS workers on the occasion of Deen Dayal Upadyay''s birth anniversary here, Singh contended that any government had to look to both the materialistic and spiritual needs of the citizens.

""Upadyay''s vision was that the development of the society was linked to the comprehensive and integrated development of each person. To bring about a dharma raj, we need to have spiritual development as well as material development, but the other parties do not understand the definition of either spiritualism or dharma,"" he maintained.

While spiritual was the elevation of the soul, dharma was the rules and regulations which controlled the existence, development and protection of the entire world. ""Wind''s quality of blowing and fire''s quality of burning are their dharmas. This is the definition given by our sages, which should satisfy us, but it is ironic that Parliament still wants to define dharma!"" he rued.

Singh also said the will of the majority was not dharma. ""In a democracy, everyone thinks that the will of the majority rules. This is not true. The entire French people and the PM wanted to surrender to Hitler in the II World War, but it was Charles de Gaulle who fulfilled rashtra dhrama by vowing to fight for French freedom,"" he explained.

Deputy PM L.K. Advani''s concept of cultural nationalism also came from Upadyay. ""He believed that cultural unity will bring about political unity. If India has to become a world guru and carve out a special identity for itself, we must go to our cultural roots for that,'' Singh declared.

Speaking to reporters here after participating in Deen Dayal Upadyay''s birth anniversary celebrations, Singh said: ""Doors are totally shut for BSP.""

Singh also expressed surprise over Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajvadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav''s statement that his party was prepared to go closer to BJP if it gave up some issues, including construction of Ram temple and uniform civil code.

""We have never entertained the idea of an alliance with SP,"" he maintained.
