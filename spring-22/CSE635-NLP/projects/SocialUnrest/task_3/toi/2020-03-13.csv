0,"Kamal Nath, Vaghela face party men's wrath","GANDHINAGAR: It was total pandemonium at a meeting organised by the GPCC at the Town Hall here on Thursday afternoon. Even the national anthem, sung at the end of the meeting, failed to discipline the irate Congress workers.

The anger was not just against the AICC Gujarat incharge Kamal Nath but also GPCC chief Shankersinh Vaghela and others who sat on the dais â€” Amarsinh Chaudhary, Urmilaben Patel, K K Sharma. However, Ahmed Patel was absent. Congress workers struggled to rush to the dais, unmindful of the anthem.

They were all out to protest against the handling of the assembly poll campaign. Kamal Nath was twice hooted down before he could begin his speech, while Vaghela could not even start. Vaghela, who was to conclude the session, was heckled at by several back-benchers, shouting and abusing the Central and state leaders for the debacle. â€œItâ€™s a family quarrel, let''s not act like thatâ€�, Vaghela sought to pacify them. But he failed. The GPCC chief declared the meeting over, asking partymen to stand up for the national anthem.

Things worsened when in a corner Vaghelaâ€™s son, Mahendrasinh, tossed in the air the â€˜pagriâ€™ from the head of a Congressman sitting in front of him. Workers rushed to Mahendrasinh and had a heated exchange. It was only when Congress Seva Dal volunteers intervened that the tempers cooled down.

Earlier, workers called leaders â€˜thievesâ€™ for taking bribe to allot tickets. Voices could be heard from the audience holding Kamal Nath responsible for â€˜destroying the Congressâ€™. Someone shouted Rs 50 lakh. Another said the amount was Rs 50 crore! When Congressman Maulin Vaishnav moved a resolution hailing the partyâ€™s victory in Himachal Pradesh, a worker shouted from the back, â€œYou''d better move a resolution paying homage to the Congress in Gujaratâ€�.

When Kamal Nath spoke of the assembly poll as having been organised by the state unit, a worker shouted at him, â€œThe whole poll campaign was sponsored from the Centreâ€�.

1,Irrigation employees defer demonstration,"PUNE: Employees of Krishna, Tapi, Konkan, Godavari and Vidarbha Valley Development corporations have postponed their proposed agitation to demand salaries through treasury to Saturday.

An irrigation employees'' action committee release said the demonstrations had been postponed on account of Moharram on Friday.

There will be, however, no change in the agitation planned at Azad Maidan in Mumbai on March 19, Ramesh Agavane, co-convenor of the committee, told TNN on Thursday.

Agavane said employees of MKVDC and other corporations had been demanding salaries through the treasury to avoid delay in their payment.

""The government had agreed to do so and had promised to make the necessary provisions in the budget. However, we learn that the budgetary provisions would cover only 20 per cent of the salary amount, while the remaining 80 per cent will have to be paid by the respective corporations from money raised through bonds,"" he said.

The committee pointed out that MKVDC had no money left from the amount raised through bonds, which meant its employees will not get salaries in the next financial year.

Meanwhile, a delegation of the committee met irrigation minister (in- charge of MKVDC) Ajit Pawar, irrigation minister Padamsinh Patil, irrigation secretary Nandkumar Vadnere and other officials on Wednesday to press their demand. ""We got no concrete assurances,"" Agavne complained.

2,CID arrests 13 in Vasavi Bank scam,"HYDERABAD: Thirteen present and former directors of the Vasavi Co-operative Urban Bank were arrested by the Crime Investigation Department on Thursday.

The directors, who were apparently taken into custody on Thursday evening near the Markfed office in Saifabad, were quickly huddled into police vehicles and taken to the CID office in the DGP office complex at Lakdi-ka-Pul.

The arrested bankers include G Rajamouli Gupta, M Sudhakar Gupta, G Veeresham, G Chandraiah, G Ashok Kumar, B Rajender, R Venkateswar Rao, S Sangameswara Gupta, B Narsimha, P Jayaprakash Ram, R Narasimha Rao, Ravindranath Gupta and G Janardhan.

The CID officials recorded the statements of the directors in different rooms. According to additional director-general of police M L Kumawat, police have detected Rs 20.02 crore worth of questionable loans taken by the bankers. The directors had converted the loans into overdrafts to evade repayment. The total non-performing assets of the bank amounted to 67.02 crore, he said.

The largest loan detected so far, of Rs 3.31 crore, was taken by G Rajamouli Gupta. His two sons â€” Ramesh and Praveen â€” had taken loans of Rs 81 lakh each and his daughter-in-law Jayashree, Rs 88.50 lakh.

Sudhakar Gupta apparently took a loan of Rs 2.7 crore in the name of his driver P Sudheer. Kumawat said all directors and former directors of the bank took loans by pledging a particular plot in Begumpet measuring 7,528 sq yards on which they do not have any ownership rights.

The directors have also facilitated loans for many firms, most of whom have not submitted the relevant documents with the bank. The firms whose names have come up during interrogation of the directors included Lakshminarayana and Co, Bhagwan Das Enterprises, Kamakshi Enterprises, Karuna Associates, Venugopal Transport, Sarveswara Transport, Maheswara Enterprises, Bhargavi Enterprises, Sunny Enterprises and Rasi and Co. Kumawat also said that these firms had not complied with even the basic rules pertaining to taking bank loans.

â€œNone of the borrowers photo and address has been submitted. Neither did the borrowers submit the project report and the nature of business they are doingâ€�.

5,Rebels cut Marandi government to size,"RANCHI: In a dramatic turn of events on Thursday, the 27-month-old Babulal Marandi government was reduced to minority when seven ministers â€” four of Cabinet rank and three Ministers of State â€” resigned from the ministry and sat on the Opposition benches in the post-lunch session of the ongoing budget session.

The seven ministers include three from the Samata â€” Madhu Singh, Revenue Minister, Ramesh Singh Munda, Excise Minister, and Jaleswar Mahto, PHED Minister, two from the JD-U â€” Lalchand Mahto, Energy Minister, and Baidyanath Ram, Sports Minister, as well as two Independents â€” Samresh Singh, Science and Technology Minister, and Joba Manjhi, Tourism Minister.

Late in the evening, Opposition leaders met Governor Rama Jois and staked their claim to form the government. Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari has unanimously been elected their leader.

Babulal Marandi also met the Governor and conveyed that he would prove his majority in the House and that the Speaker had indulged in foul play by allowing the ministers to sit in the Opposition and declaring the motion against the government passed without getting a voting done in the House.

The CM alleged that the Speaker was part of the political conspiracy. Jois promised to look into the proceedings.

However, Namdhari denied charges of conspiring against the government.

Over the past fortnight, five ministers had revolted against Marandi and demanded his removal. They got a boost when the two Independent ministers decided to join their bandwagon.

The 82-member Jharkhand Assembly at present has 80 members, including the Speaker. With seven ministers crossing over to the opposition, the ruling alliance is left with 32 BJP MLAs, two Samata MLAs and two Independents, while the opposition has 42 members.

On Thursday, a cut motion in industry department''s budget was moved by JMMâ€™s Hemlal Murmu.

The seven rebel ministers entered the House, submitted their resignations to the Speaker and took seat in the opposition benches. The mines minister soon moved a no-confidence motion against the Speaker.

In the melee that ensued, the Speaker announced that the cut motion against the government was passed by voice vote. The House was later declared adjourned for 15 days by Loknath Mahto, who was in the chair.

6,Unstamped meat in upmarket shops,"CHANDIGARH: Buying meat from swanky, upmarket departmental stores is no guarantee of its quality. On Thursday, the MOH wing of the Municipal Corporation confiscated over 20 full unstamped goats being sold under unhygienic conditions at reputed departmental stores.

The drive against unstamped meat was initiated at the behest of Mayor Subhash Chawla. Employees of the MOH wing raided departmental stores including JD''s store in Sector 35, from where six unstamped full goats, whose meat was being sold, were seized.

Four goats were seized from MG Superstore in Sector 9, four from Punjab Meat in Sector 37 and three from Peshawari Store in Sector 19. All the goats were not stamped and had not been approved by civic authorities in MC''s slaughter house in Industrial Area.

Mayor Subhash Chawla, who had asked the MOH wing to initiate action against those selling unhygienic meat said, ""There were reports of big departmental stores selling unstamped meat. Also, with summers round the corner, the possibility of outbreak of diseases is high and the raid was a precautionary exercise initiated by the MC.""

Medical Officer of Health Dr GC Bansal said, ""All meat sold for consumption has to be butchered in MC''s Slaughter House in Industrial Area, where the animal is medically examined and approved for this. The slaughtering procedure there is hygienic and totally mechanised. After slaughtering, the animals are stamped with an MC seal, which is a foolproof way of letting people know that the meat is safe for consumption.""

MC officials said that besides issuing of challans, the departmental stores, may also have their licence to sell meat cancelled. The confiscated meat was later destroyed by the MC staff at the Dadu Majra dumping ground.

7,Temple priest commits suicide in Sector 22,"CHANDIGARH: A temple priest, said to be in his early twenties, ended his life by hanging himself at his Sector 22 house. His body was found on Thursday morning by his neighbours. The deceased, Subash Chand, left four suicide notes addressed to his wife, children, mother, maternal uncle and police, saying that he suffered from some uncurable mental ailment and was ending his life so that he did not become a burden on them. Subash Chand worked as a priest at the Sector 22 Shastri Market temple and had come to the city a couple of years ago from Tehri Garhwal. On Thursday morning, when he did not reach the temple, ""mandir pradhan"" Madan Lal went to his house to inquire about him. After many knocks, when there was no response, the deceased's neighbours and Lal, through a crack in the door, saw Chand lying on the floor. Then they entered the room by breaking open a window at the first floor. ""The scene was horrifying. The pandit was lying on the floor with his fist clenched, a broken rope round his neck and a piece of rope hung by the ceiling hook,"" said a neighbour. The pandit had committed suicide by hanging himself and used a gas cylinder to reach the ceiling hook. He might have fallen after the rope gave way, the neighbour added. The police was informed and it sent the body for postmortem. Neighbours told Times News Network that Subash often confided in them that he had some disease for which he even went to hospital. ""He never told us what disease it was. He went into depression,"" they added. Subash is survived by his wife and two children. He took them to his native village last month and returned alone. In his suicide note addressed to his wife, he asked her to take care of his children and always love them. And in other notes addressed to his uncle and mother, said that they look after his children. In the final note addressed to police, he said that he was taking his life by himself and no one was responsible for it.

8,Exodus hits rural govt schools,"CHANDIGARH: With students in rural pockets choosing to join schools in urban areas after matriculation, rural government schools are left with a small number of students in senior secondary classes.

The rationale for having senior secondary schools in rural belts may have been to afford equal opportunity to the students there, but it seems calculations of the education department have gone awry, due to the rural students'' obsession for urban schools.

The senior secondary schools where student enrolment is minimal include Government Senior Secondary School (GSSS), Sector 38 (W), GSSS, Dhanas and GSSS, Karsan. The count of class XII students at these schools is about 40 each, which is substantially lower (two to four times) than senior secondary schools in urban areas.

The picture is most pitiable at GSSS, Maloya - which was upgraded to senior secondary level more than five years ago, but continues to function as a high school as students are simply not interested in studying here after matriculation. GSSS, Maloya principal Prem Gupta said students were more inclined to enrol in urban schools after passing class X.

""The existing scenario at rural schools is the result of the student''s love for urban schools. We do not have any formula to draw senior students to our schools,"" she said.

Another reason for students making a beeline for urban schools is availability of more options here. In rural senior secondary schools, students have no alternative other than pursuing the arts stream after passing class X.

GSSS principal D P Singh said the decisive factor for seeking admission to schools in urban areas was that students could choose from different streams. He added, ""Rural students are sometimes more inclined towards undertaking vocational courses for which we do not have any provision. To them, enrolling in other schools appears logical.""

The education department is sensitive to the issue of this ''student exodus'' but has no panacea for the declining student enrolment in rural schools. An education department official said, ""The intent of upgrading high schools in rural areas to senior secondary level was to offer convenience to students. The plan has not worked well in some pockets.""

Student scarcity is not the sole problem afflicting rural schools. Most of the students who seek admission to class XI at these schools comprise students who have barely managed to pass or are compartment cases.

Satya Pawar, a senior teacher at GSSS, Dhanas said, ""The handful of good students that we have do not prefer to continue here. Students who land up here are mostly those who fail to secure admission elsewhere.""

9,SC strikes down poll reforms law,"NEW DELHI: Confronting Parliament for making a ""half-hearted"" attempt to cleanse the election process and to curb criminalisation of politics, the Supreme Court on Thursday declared as ""unconstitutional"" the amended electoral reforms law which negated its laudable verdict making it mandatory for the candidates to disclose their criminal antecedents, assets and liabilities and educational qualification in the nomination papers.

In a landmark judgement, the court restored its May 2, 2002, verdict. A Bench of Justices M B Shah, P V Reddi and D M Dharmadhikari also questioned Parliament''s legislative competence to ask the state or its instrumentality to disobey the court''s orders. The judges pronounced separate but concurring judgements.

""The legislature cannot declare that the law declared by the Supreme Court is not binding,"" Justice Shah said.

Aggrieved by the court''s directives which were supported by the newly-enacted Right to Information Act, the Centre first promulgated an ordinance and then amended the Representation of People Act (RPA).

Section 33 of the amended RPA stipulated ""notwithstanding anything contained in any judgement"" of any court or any order of the Election Commission, ""no candidate shall be liable to disclose or furnish any such information, in respect of his election, which is not required to be disclosed or furnished under this Act or the rules made thereunder.""

The amended RPA also stipulated that the candidates have to give details of only such criminal cases in which cognisance has been taken by the court. It also said that only elected candidates were required to give details of their assets and liabilities but did not make any provision for declaring their educational qualifications.

Holding that the amended RPA curtailed the right of people to know about their candidates, the court also quashed section 33 and clarified that it would be effectuated prospectively.

The court also directed the EC to issue a fresh notification for the implementation of its judgement.

Keeping the amended RPA in mind, the Bench asked whether there was any necessity to keep the voters in dark about any murder, dacoity or rape committed by a candidate or about his ill-gotten money which could be used for elections.

Justice Shah said that the judgement was aimed at cleansing the democracy of unwanted elements and give the country a competent legislature.

Henceforth, unless the government still attempts to circumvent the judgement, each candidate would have to furnish on affidavit five types of information while filing his/her nomination:

(1) Whether he is convicted / acquitted / discharged of any criminal offence in the past, if any, whether he is punished with imprisonment or fine?

(2) Prior to six months of filing the nomination, whether he or she is accused in any pending case of any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more, and in which charge is framed or cognizance is taken by the court of law. If so, the details thereof.

(3) The assets (immovable, movable, bank balances etc) and of his / her spouse and that of dependents.

(4) Liabilities, if any, particularly whether there are any overdues of any public financial institutions or government dues.

(5) The educational qualification.

The court said that the amended RPA was a ""half-hearted attempt"" by the government to fight the use of money and muscle power in elections.

This judgement is a fall out of the petitions challenging the ordinance and the Act filed by the People''s Union for Civil Liberties, Lok Satta and Association for Democratic Reforms.

10,Stage set for court-legislature clash,"NEW DELHI: With the Supreme Court declaring amendments in the Representation of People''s Act ""unconstitutional"", the field is now set for ""open confrontation"" between the legislature and judiciary.

This is how a senior law ministry official reacted to the Supreme Court''s Thursday judgement.

Privately, officials admit that what went against the government is total disregard of the SC''s May 2, 2002 order which held that the voters'' right to know the criminal antecedents, assets and liabilities and educational qualification of candidates seeking elective office is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(a) of the Constitution.

The apex court had also directed the Election Commission to call for this information on an affidavit. On June 28, 2002, the EC issued a detailed order implementing the SC''s directive.

""Cutting across party lines the political establishment came together to dilute the SC''s order,"" says the official.

Despite President APJ Abdul Kalam returning the electoral reforms ordinance once in August 2002, political parties unanimously came together in undoing the SC order.

For instance, parties decided that only those convicted for an offence punishable with two years imprisonment can be disqualified. Also, they decided that instead of candidates declaring their assets and liabilities in an affidavit at the time of filing nomination, they would give the information only to the presiding officers of legislatures.

The amendment bill was finally passed in the Winter Session of Parliament last year.

But the amendment went against the SC and the Election Commission orders. It did not require the candidate to give any information about his educational and financial backgrounds.

There was no way of knowing whether the candidate has defaulted on repayment of bank loans or has unpaid electricity, water and air travel bills which are long overdue.

The issue of disclosing the criminal background was also limited in intent since it only provided for a procedure and proforma for filing such information before the returning officer, nothing else.

Also, according to the amended law, if a candidate is chargesheeted less than six months before filing nominations, he can still contest elections and become an MP or MLA.

Law ministry officials feel that ""the final word"" is yet to come out on the contentious issue. Says one official, ""Centre is hellbent on subverting the judicial pronouncement on this issue. Even when the Delhi High Court held in 2000 that the past of the candidate should not be kept in the dark, the centre appealed against it in the SC.""

The way out, he suggests, can be a compromise whereby political establishment would have to accommodate SC''s order of giving criminal background, assets and liabilities of candidates.

""Disqualification rules would have to be made more stringent. But apex court''s insistence on educational qualification would be given a quiet burial,"" official hopes.

11,"Fiscal policy is untenable, says Jaswant","NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister and Deputy PM by his side, finance minister Jaswant Singh told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday the fiscal policy is unaffordable and untenable.

""This policy is a legacy,'''' he told an attentive audience, which included two of his predecessors, Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee.

""Of our revenue, 50 per cent is swallowed by payment of just interest on (government) debt. Another 20 per cent goes on subsidies and 25 per cent on defence. What am I left with?

""So, like all my predecessors, I have had to borrow. This year, it is Rs 1,53,000 crore. When I do this, I''m soaking up all the domestic saving available. Where is the money for investment by other sectors to come from?'''' he asked.

Jaswant said: ""Our entire plan budgetary support this year is Rs 1,21,000 crore. And subsidies are Rs 1,50,000 crore. Of this, Rs 28,000 crore goes on food or is agro-related; I can''t touch that. And another Rs 12,000-Rs 13,000 crore on fertiliser...I''ve just had to withdraw on trying to cut it. How can we afford to go on like this?''''

He said: ""What to do about all this is a decision the political community has got to take collectively. Either we sit down and collectively decide what to do or we can keep playing political ping-pong.''''

He remarked: ""Just consider: our borrwing to pay interest is Rs 30,000 crore more than what we can give for Plan support. We''re funding the Plan through borrowings. We can''t just keep going on this path. We''ve got to sit down together and address it.''''

Replying to the House debate on the appropriations Bill, which was later passed, the finance minister said he was keeping a close watch on inflation, whose growth had accelerated between November and February due to the drought and the Gulf uncertainty; it is now at an annual rate of around three per cent.

""I''m continuously in touch with the governor of the Reserve Bank of India and we''re monitoring it...nothing affects the common man as much.''''

12,Govt to call all-party meet on SC verdict,"NEW DELHI: The government will call an all-party meeting to discuss Thursday''s Supreme Court ruling declaring as unconstitutional the controversial electoral reforms law and restoring its earlier directives that candidates at the time of filing their nominations must declare their criminal antecedents, assets and liabilities as well as educational qualifications.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said: ""Since the law passed by Parliament had emerged from an all-party meeting, we need to have another such meeting to discuss the SC ruling striking down the law.""

Interestingly, while the BJP''s response to the ruling was negative, the Congress welcomed it. BJP spokesperson V K Malhotra said: ""This is a very serious judgement and needs to be dealt with seriously. Without studying the judgment, we don''t want to comment, but we do feel that in matters of law making, Parliament is supreme and under our Constitution, each pillar of democracy has a different function.""

The Congress, on the other hand, claimed that its stand on the electoral reforms law has been vindicated by the SC ruling. ""We will not cooperate with any move to nullify the SC judgement. The electorate has every right to know the criminal antecedents and the assets and liabilities of the candidates. Our only opposition is in empowering returning officers to reject nominations,"" said Congress spokesperson S Jaipal Reddy.

About the supremacy of the legislature being challenged by the judiciary, Reddy said that the SC had every right to go in for a judicial review of a piece of legislation.

The party refused to comment when it was pointed out that earlier Congress governments had overturned SC judgments through legislations as in the case of the Shah Bano judgement.

Of the BJP''s NDA partners, the Telugu Desam Party''s Yerran Naidu, while saying that he needed to study the judgment before giving a considered opinion, stressed: ""While we are for transparency in declaration of property etc, we are opposed to giving the right to the returning officer to cancel a nomination based on these declarations.""

The Shiv Sena''s Chandrakant Khaire said that a distinction had to be made between a candidate being implicated in a political and a criminal case.

CPM general secretary H K S Surjeet said that the ruling could deprive a large number of people of participating in the electoral process. ""It does not seem to be a wise move,"" he said reacting to the court verdict negating the all-party view on electoral reforms.

He wondered whether issues like the low level of education and desirability of delving into someone''s background had been properly explored. ""We will discuss it with other Opposition parties,"" he said.

But another Opposition leader, the Rashtriya Janata Dal''s Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, welcomed the ruling and said: ""If political parties have failed to prevent criminalisation of their members and another institution is willing to step in to do it for them, it is a good thing.""

15,Four hurt in Vadodara riots,"VADODARA/AHMEDABAD: Tazia processions in Vadodara turned violent on Friday afternoon in which four persons, including two policemen, were injured. Police had to resort to firing and lobbing teargas shells to quell the violence. Trouble continued till late evening as mobs came out on the streets in the Wadi Ladwada area where the police had to fire 9 rounds to.

In all, some 25 rounds were fired by the police during the day but there was no reports of bullet injuries. Trouble started from Sarasiya Talav area when Moharram tazias were being immersed at about 4 pm. Rival groups clashed and pelted stones. A nearby house was ransacked by a mob. Police officers said that processionists had complained about stone pelting on them.

â€œWhile this is yet to be ascertained, it might have led to rioting. Processionists then barged into a nearby house and ransacked it,â€� said police commissioner D D Tuteja Late on Friday evening, the police nabbed 115 persons returning after immersions. They were pelting stones on the way and carrying stones in vehicles. Earlier, leaders of both the communities had agreed to observe restraint on Moharram. Harmony was, however, nowhere to be seen on Friday.

While the city Tazia Committee had decided against bringing out tazias, some dissidents insisted on doing so. As many as 68 applications were cleared by the police. First signals of trouble were seen on Thursday night itself when rival groups clashed during a â€˜tazia pittaniâ€™ procession in Panigate. On Friday, policemen on duty near the pond were also targetted by mobs.

Rioters smashed the glasses of the car of joint commissioner of police P C Thakur. The car driver and a wireless operator were injured and were taken to SSG Hospital. Thakur said that vehicles of policemen parked at the spot were also charred. â€œThey set ablaze two two-wheelers of policemen of the special branch. The rioters also attacked a middle-aged man and he was taken to a hospital for treatment,â€� Thakur said.

Trouble then spilled over to other parts of the city with mobs gathering on the route of the procession. The situation here was brought under control soon with teargas shells. Rioting broke out in several neighbouring localities of Fatehpura. Besides stones, soda bottles and cracker bombs were used by the mobs.

16,HC fines bank for harassing riot victims,"NEW DELHI: The high court has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the Union Bank of India (UBI), for causing harassment to two riot victims over recovery of interest on loan advanced to them under a subsidised scheme.

â€˜â€˜This is a case where the effort of the government to ameliorate the riot victims of 1984 has been deliberately subverted by the bank. The profound agony of the victims magnified and prolonged for nearly 18 years,â€™â€™ said Justice B A Khan and Justice R S Sodhi in a judgment.

The judgment came on an appeal by two riot victims against the order of a district court here, which had allowed a suit by the bank for recovery of Rs 1.6 lakh from them, on Rs 2 lakh loan advanced for purchase of a truck under the interest free central subsidy scheme (CSS). Allowing the appeal , the court directed that the cost would be paid by the bank to the petitioners in equal proportion.
