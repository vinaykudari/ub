0,"No riots in MP, yet relief","BHOPAL: There are no communal riots in Madhya Pradesh. But four months to the assembly elections, the Digvijay Singh government is creating a fund for â€˜â€˜riot-affectedâ€™â€™ people. â€˜â€˜Adequate arrangements will be made to provide relief and rehabilitation to persons affected by communal riots,â€™â€™ said chief minister Digvijay Singhâ€™s Minorities Agenda passed at a cabinet meeting on Thursday.

The agenda also claims â€˜â€˜introduction of a fund-e-madarsa schemeâ€™â€™ for funding of madrasas. This has been strongly objected to by the BJP. The cabinetâ€™s eight-point action plan for development and welfare of minorities include development of madarsas, providing educational and job sops to minorities, increased health facilities and creation of a fund for â€˜â€˜riot-affectedâ€™â€™.

BJPâ€™s chief ministerial candidate Uma Bharti argues, â€˜â€˜It seems Digvijay wants riots. He plans for them. â€œHe is creating a fear psychosis among Muslims. Whether Muslims are afraid or not, the chief minister certainly is.â€™â€™

During a press conference here on Friday, she said: â€˜â€˜Digvijay has insulted the people by creating a fund for â€˜â€˜riot-affectedâ€™â€™ when there are no communal riots in the state.â€™â€™

The BJP is also peeved at the fund-e-madarsa sch-eme. The government already runs a fund-a-school scheme whereby anyone can fund a government-run Education Guarantee Scheme School anywhere in the state. The state claims to have 26,000 such schools some of which have been funded by industrial houses and bureaucrats. Even foreign nationals can fund these schools.

1,Jagmohan ministry has no role: UP govt,"NEW DELHI: Asserting that environmental impact assessment of controversial Rs 175 crore Taj heritage corridor project be given to the Union environment ministry, the Uttar Pradesh government has stoutly opposed in the Supreme Court any role being assigned to Union tourism and culture ministry headed by Jagmohan.

This assertion was made by the state government through an affidavit filed in reply to court commissioner Krishan Mahajanâ€™s plea to the court to ask the Union tourism ministry to immediately issue directions to the state chief secretary under Environment Protection Act for immediate removal of all debris deposited by rain water behind and around Taj Mahal.

Mahajan had also pleaded that a time-bound action plan be drawn up by the ministry of tourism and culture for the protection of Taj and other world/national heritage monuments at Agra affected by the alleged unauthorised construction of the heritage corridor project. The affidavit filed by the new environment secretary Vinod Kumar Gupta, who took over from the suspended environment secretary R K Sharma, said the directions under the Environment Act could only be issued by the Union environment ministry and not by the ministry of tourism and culture.

The court on Friday directed the technical committee set up by the environment ministry to assess the damage potential of the debris swept away by monsoon water to Taj Mahal. It was on the initiative of Union tourism minister Jagmohan that the ongoing work of the heritage corridor by the Uttar Pradesh government was stopped last month.

The state government, opposing Mahajanâ€™s request to the court, said â€œThe ministry of tourism and culture has no role to play with regard to the enforcement of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.""

â€œDistribution of business amongst ministries is sole constitutional prerogative of the prime minister and council of ministries and there is no justification for seeking any direction to alter the existing arrangement by involving ministry of tourism and culture for enforcing the 1986 act,â€� the state government said.

2,VB arrests station superintendent,"BATHINDA: The Vigilance Bureau on Saturday claimed to have arrested a secretary of the cooperative department of Faridkot area for getting a government job by using fake certificates of his educational qualifications.

The department has also arrested a station superintendent for accepting bribe from vendors at the railway station.

SSP (vigilance) Baljinder Singh Grewal said that Jarnail Singh, who was working as secretary in the Jhakarwala cooperative society in Faridkot district for the last many years, had got a government job after producing fake certificates.

Grewal said that following a complaint, the Vigilance Bureau cross-examined Jarnail Singhâ€™s matriculation certificates from Panjab University dated 1966. However, in the university records no such certificate was issued in the name of Jarnail Singh, who was in government job since 1981.

The Vigilance Bureau also arrested a station superintendent posted at the Mansa railway station for accepting a bribe of Rs 1,000 from a vendor.

Grewal said station superintendent Yoginder Partap Singh was taking Rs 500 per month from vendors at the railway station, and those who declined to pay him the bribe were harassed on one pretext or the other.

After a complaint by a vendor, Ajay Kumar, the Vigilance Bureau laid a trap and caught the superintendent red-handed accepting the bribe. It is alleged that the superintendent had purchased a house in Faridabad in 1999 by investing Rs 6 lakh. The vigilance department is proving the sources of money which the accused invested to purchase the house, said Grewal.

In another case, the Vigilance Bureau has arrested PRTC Bathinda depot general manager Harbakhat Singh, who was a co-accused in a case of corruption registered against a cashier of the depot, Amrik Singh. The case was registered on June 25, 2003. As the general manager had already got anticipatory bail from the Bathinda district and sessions judge, he was released on bail after arrest.

3,More violence on LU campus,"LUCKNOW: Adopting ''gorilla style'', Lucknow University hostlers once again struck and ransacked the car of Subash Hostel provost VP Gupta, when he went to the hostel on Sunday morning to identify illegal occupants there. The strike came a day after LU authorities expelled five hostlers for indulging in vandalism and violence on the campus.

Meanwhile, LU authorities expelled one more student Digvijay Nath Shukla (LLB), identified as one of the brains behind the Saturday violence, and expelled him from the university. But these expulsions seem to have made no impact as, unleashing a spell of terror among the teachers residing on the campus, these hostel residents promised more â€˜actionâ€™ in the coming days.

Prof Gupta, escorted by two assistant provosts Prof MM Tripathi and Prof PK Rath, had gone to Subhash hostel on a routine checking exercise, when a mob comprising hostel inmates, came from behind and ransacked his car, parked outside the hostel premises, and left quickly. The action was so swift that the culprits could not be recognised. Police was called, but they too were helpless as no hostel resident was ready to identify the miscreants.

Tension gripped the campus, particularly those teachers living in the residential accommodations situated on the campus, after the incident. A teachersâ€™ delegation soon met vice-chancellor Prof SB Singh and requested him to arrange for proper security arrangements for teachers as well as their family members. Studentsâ€™ hostels and teachersâ€™ residences are separated by only a road on the campus. Teachers feared that anything could happen to them anytime.

Later, a delegation of teachers, including some LU officials, met district magistrate Navneet Sehgal and requested him to arrange for more security forces for the campus.

Thereafter, several officials of the district and the police administration met the V-C and chalked out a plan of action.

By evening, a heavy posse of police and several companies of PAC were stationed on the campus all around the hostel premises.

4,LU violence: Culprits still unidentified,"LUCKNOW: Even as Lucknow University authorities on Sunday decided to evict criminal elements and unauthorised occupants from the university hostels with the help of the district administration, the questions doing the round on the campus were about the identity of those behind the sudden eruption of violence and why students were resorting to violent agitations on the campus, expressing their anger by assaulting innocent teachers.

On the other hand, although Luta leadership appears to be in support of the vice-chancellor, but majority of teachers was said to be unhappy because their demands related to promotions and regularisation of services were pending and were not being heard.

A teachersâ€™ strike, too, seems a possibility as campus opens on Monday and a group of younger lot of teachers has decided to raise a banner of revolt if Luta leadership stuck to its â€˜softâ€™ stand against the V-C.

The campus was, by and large, peaceful for the last three years and criminal activities were fading away with strictness in admission process, which allowed admissions of only meritorious students.

However, now these sudden spate of events have left many perplexed in Lucknow University. It has also left LU authorities embarrassed in front of those students who are taking admission this year.

If sources were to be believed, the prime reason of discontent among the hostlers was the LU authorities decision to make mess facilities compulsory for the residents in every hostel.

While use of electric heaters in the hostels has been banned as it was costing LU coffers over Rs 12-Rs 15 lakh per year, now every hostler would be charged Rs 32 per day for mess facility. â€œMost of the hostlers come from economically weak background and spending around Rs 1000 on food only was a luxury for them,â€� said hostlers.

In fact, hostel residents have been for the last two decades in the habit of cooking their food on electric heaters in their rooms.

A section of them relies on â€˜influential student leadersâ€™, who make arrangements for nice lunch and dinner in various hotels and dabhas in the city on cheap rates.

This student unrest is being cashed in by a group of student leaders and students with criminal antecedents, who are living in hostels in an unauthorised manner and find hostel rooms a safe haven.

These criminal elements have thus strategically added demand of studentsâ€™ union elections with that of scrapping mess facilities so that university politics can become a platform for them to enter state party politics.

If highly placed sources were to be believed, teachers politics, too, was playing a major role of â€˜catalystâ€™ in the studentsâ€™ movement.

â€œThe war actually is between two lobbies of teachers, one out of power and another in power, who are using students as a pawn in their politics,â€� said a senior office-bearer of LU Teacherâ€™s Association (Luta).

Decisions related to students and hostels were being taken without consulting senior teachers and student representatives, said a group of teachers, adding that all onus to implement the decision had been left on the provosts.

â€œEmployees, too, are unhappy. The crisis here was absence of a collective decision,â€� he said. All these problems have accumulated gradually, but not disposed of properly by the LU administration, they added.

5,Central government advocate suspended on harassment charge,"MUMBAI: The law ministry has suspended senior central government advocate H.D. Rathod in Mumbai in the wake of several complaints of corruption and harassment made against him by other lawyers on the Centreâ€™s panel.

Mr Rathod, who represents the government before the Bombay high court and has been a government lawyer for 11 years, said that he had been suspended and a â€œdepartmental enquiry is being contemplatedâ€™â€™ against him.He said the ministry had sent his suspension order through a joint secretary, A. Agrawal.

Several senior lawyers and staff members of the law ministryâ€™s branch secretariat in Mumbai had recently written to the law secretary in Delhi complaining about â€œirregularitiesâ€™â€™ in the ministryâ€™s Mumbai office. They pointed out that Mr Rathod who was in charge of the ministryâ€™s office in Mumbai was responsible for assigning cases to lawyers on the government panel.

They alleged that only a few lawyers got regular work on a commission basis. Some of the women staffers in the ministryâ€™s office as well as women lawyers complained of discrimination and harassment. They also alleged that Mr Rathod often spoke rudely to his staff and juniors and ridiculed them. The lawyers had demanded an enquiry against Mr Rathod.

6,'Frame education policy for disabled',"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has asked the state government to formulate a proper admission policy for physically challenged candidates. The court said they should be given at least three per cent seats in its various educational institutions.

Justice Vikramjit Sen gave this direction on a petition filed by Kamlesh Chellani who was allegedly denied admission to the Bachelor of Education (B Ed) course of Guru Gobind Singh IP University. Chellani was not granted admission despite qualifying the entrance examination.

The court also directed the university to give one seat to the petitioner even if the seats are already filled in the B Ed course this year. The court relied upon one of the sections of the Disabilities Act, 1996 which mandates all government educational institutions and those receiving aid from the government to reserve not less than 3 per cent seats for physically challenged.

7,Porters plan protest march over wages,"PUNE: Porters affiliated to the Hamal Panchayat will take a protest march to the district collectorate here on July 30, demanding revision of wages. The march will start from the Hamal Panchayat office at 11 am and reach the collectorate in the afternoon.

Baba Adhav, founder president of the Hamal Panchayat, said in a statement that negotiations with the Poona Merchantsâ€™ Chamber about revision of wages ended in a deadlock, forcing the porters to take to the streets.

A memorandum will be submitted to the collector urging him to intervene in the matter. Copies of the memorandum will also be sent to the director of marketing and the additional labour commissioner.

Adhav said the wage agreement between the Hamal Panchayat and the Poona Merchantsâ€™ Chamber expired on May 31, 2003. The Panchayat had sent a memorandum to the chamber demanding revision of wages.

Adhav said subsequent meetings, held on July 16, 18 and 24, had not yielded any results. The chamber made counter demands about basic wages paid to porters, charges paid per quintal of goods lifted and carried, loading and unloading from tempos and shops. The Panchayat gave a written explanation about the counter demands, but the matter of revision could not be settled, he said.

The Panchayat leader said that usually, these issues were settled by the co-ordination committee.

However, the committee failed to take up the matter during the past three years, forcing the porters to approach the collector, Adhav added.

8,Urbanites strike roots in farming,"AHMEDABAD: Over the noise of a tractor working a stretch of land comes a voice laced with glee, happy that clouds are gathering over his field. There is a look of expectation on the face of this tall, moustachioed speaker navigating the tractor.

This man tilling land on the bank of the Mahi is no ordinary farmer. Just about two years ago, he was at the helm of a well-known universities. Today, Anil Kane, former vicechancellor of MS University of Baroda, is happy spending time with the brown earth and green fields.

He is one of a growing tribe of â€˜gentlemen farmersâ€™ in Gujarat who are striking new roots â€” taking to farming, finding time from the daily grind of their professional lives and the urban chaos. The hands that design a building, raise a scalpel or draft policies are also tilling land and sowing seeds. And they are reaping a rich harvest of mental peace.

Kane has developed 300 metre of the waterfront along the Mahi in Amrol village on the outskirts of Vadodara, growing onion, amla, chikoo, coconut, mango and atroba, an oil seed. He borrows a tractor to till the land and, after a hard dayâ€™s work, retires to a beautiful two-bedroom house designed by leading Vadodarabased architect Suryakant Patel.

â€œI will soon start helping the marginal farmers around my farm. This job rejuvenates me and I enjoy myself thoroughly,â€� says Kane, who now works at a leading wind energy equipment firm and spends almost all his weekends at the farm.

Busy schedules and distances canâ€™t keep these men away from their passion. Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Ashok Shah may be neck-deep in his business of manufacturing aluminium conductors and electric poles, but nothing can stop him from heading for Vyara, about 60 km from Surat, every week, where the â€œsight of growing saplings soothes my mindâ€�. â€œI may be an entrepreneur, but it seems my heart lies in agriculture,â€� says Shah, as he goes about nurturing his sugarcane and teakwood fields.

And they cannot be written off as novices. Many are becoming role models for farmers. Like the architect-builder duo from Rajkot, Kirit Kamdar and Nandlal Raja,whose use of â€˜organic manureâ€™ made from agrowaste and unique method of water conservation, are creating waves in Kanpar, 73 km from Rajkot, and have attracted agro-entrepreneurs from Dhoraji, Upleta and Paneli.

The activity also provides these people an escape from the maddening crowd and mechanical urban life. â€œLife was monotonous. It sapped me of my energy and any sense of fun,â€� says Ahmedabad-based chemical trader Moulik Barot. All that changed as Barot bought land in Vanch village and began growing vegetables and found a â€œnew reason to live and enjoy lifeâ€�.

And, itâ€™s becoming a family affair too. For Varsha and Sudhir Gala, a business couple from Vadodara, the lure of staying closer to nature encouraged them to take up organic farming. The couple is involved in growing fruits and grains on their land near Halol.

â€œThough most of the produce is for our own consumption, we give a part of the yield to an outlet in the city. My husband, who also owns a factory takes keen interest in the farming activity, though I manage the set-up,â€� says Varsha.

10,Indian-Americans turning to politics,"SAN FRANCISCO: Having made waves in medicine, business, law, information technology and other professional sectors, Indian-American are now looking to making their presence felt in the political arena.

The trend is epitomised by Bobby Jindal, the 32-year-old second generation Indian-American who is the Republican candidate for the election for Governor of Louisiana. Jindal and Kumar Barve, the Democrat majority leader in the House of Maryland, were among the speakers at a major day-long seminar held in San Francisco Saturday to train Indian-Americans of varying degrees of experience on how to interject themselves in the political process at various levels.

The Political Training & Networking Conference was organised by the Indian American Leadership Initiative (IALI), which plans to train thousands of Indian Americans to run for office.

The goal is to elect 10 Indian-Americans to federal office, both the congress and the senate, by the year 2010, by focusing on lower political offices and working their way up the ladder.

For years, Indian-Americans have been sitting on the stands cheering for those in the political court, but now has come the time for the community to be on the court, was the sentiment expressed at the well-organised and well-attended conference.

""Indian-Americans have been contributing large amounts of money to political campaigns, but for all the money we have given, how much do we really get out of it? The tangibles are so little,"" said IALI President Arun Nikore. For Indians in America the need to be politically alive and actively involved in the political fabric of the United States has been highlighted by the rising hate crimes and the increasing anti-immigrant sentiments in the county.

Underlining the need for Indians to build greater representation in public office, Deepka Lalwani -- who stood and lost a city council election in a Bay Area city last year -- said: ""You can be the best CEO or entrepreneur and have two Mercedes in your garage, but on the street you are just an ordinary brown person. Till we don''t reach the decision making process, our voices will not be heard. We have numbers that our parent didn''t have and unlike our parents, we know we are going to stay here and this is our home. But like our parents, we continue to face discrimination and hate crimes are increasing,"" said Lovely Dillon, an attorney and an IALI board member. We need to find a voice in America as an Indian American,"" she added.

Expressing similar sentiments, a participant, Neera Puri, a psychologist said: ""After the 9/11 tragedy, we were viewed as different. Our gurdwaras and temples were attacked and hate crime increased. We didn''t realise how important representation was till we became scapegoats.""

Speakers acknowledged that past generation of Indian-Americans had been more focused on settling into jobs and raising families than civic affairs. There had been scattered campaigns by Indian candidates in past years, but few succeeded.

12,Mixed response to call for Patna bandh,"PATNA: The bandh called by the BJP on Monday against increase in kidnappings in the state had a mixed response.

Life was paralysed in Ashiana Nagar of the state capital-the locality where an eight years old school going boy Sidhant Parmar son of a bank employee was kidnapped more than three days ago. Youths burnt tyres to prevent movement of traffic and the lighhts and wind screens of a few cars and two-wheelers were smashed by lathi-weilding youngsters. Though the police force was present with anti-riot vans, they remained mute spectators.

However, it was the banking sector which remained completely paralysed. Bank emplyees staged protests in front of their respective branches in Patna and Rohtas(Where another bank manager of Punjab National Bank was kidnapped and remains unrecovered). ""If we cannot feel secure about our children then how can you expect us to concentrate in banking. More than 50 per cent of the 30,000 bank employees in Bihar are from outside the state. There is a growing reluctance of bank employees in getting transferred to Bihar,"" remarked a bank official of the State Bank of India, A K Singh. Banking operations in Patna came to a grinding halt where the money transaction is around Rs 100 crore per day. Even ATM uits closed down by 10 pm.

The failure of the state government to recover Sidhant Parmar figured in the state legislative assembly where the BJP gave a 24 hours ultimatum to recover Parmar. ""If the government fails, we will stage a dharna in the Assembly on Tuesday,"" said BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi.

The state government faced criticism in the Patna high court on account of kidnapping. In response to a PIL filed by a traders association, a bench headed by Justice R Dhawan directed the state government to furnish details about actions taken by it to prevent kidnapping and extortion. ""The bench also asked the government to provide it details of action taken after a meeting chairmed by chief minister on Janruary,2001 which had given 21 points to combat kidnappers and extortionists"", remarked M P Gupta who appeared on behalf of the traders association.

14,Karnataka Fisheries Development to be closed down,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka government has proposed to shut down the 30-year-old Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation, which has incurred a loss of Rs eight crore.

""The Public Sector Restructuring Commission has recommended closure of the Corporation. The Cabinet is expected to take a decision in this regard shortly,"" fisheries and ports minister Vasanth V. Salian informed the Legislative Council on Monday.

Replying to a question from V.S. Acharya (BJP), he pointed out that 114 of the 227 staff employed by the Corporation had opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS).

Admitting that the Corporation had not paid salaries to its employees since last December, Salian said the dues had mounted to Rs one crore. ""The government has been urged to release the amount on a priority basis to clear the salary dues,"" he added.

The operational efficiency of the Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation was just 10 per cent. ""A majority of the cold storage and ice-manufacturing units have become useless. In case, the government decides to revive the Corporation, these machines have to be replaced by modern equipment"" he stated.

16,Marad violence not the result of conspiracy,"KOCHI: Kerala Government on Monday informed the High Court that the May 2 Marad violence, which claimed nine lives, was not the result of a conspiracy by any extremist organisation or outside agency, but was hatched by a relative of a victim of the previous bout of violence in January last year.

Investigation conducted so far revealed that the May 2 violence was masterminded by a relative of one Abubacker, who was slain in the earlier violence in Marad, the state government said in its counter affidavit filed by the Additional Secretary (Home), Shobana Kumari Amma, on two writ pleas seeking CBI inquiry into the violence.

The government described as ''baseless'' the allegation by the petitioners that persons wielding considerable influence in the higher echelons of power were ''deeply'' involved in the criminal conspiracy resulting in the carnage.

Investigation conducted so far had not unearthed any material to support such a conclusion, the court was told.

The government contended that the state intelligence had alerted the local police regarding the possiblity of violence in the area.
