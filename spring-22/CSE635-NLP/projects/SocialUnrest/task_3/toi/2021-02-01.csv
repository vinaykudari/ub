0,Telgi's policy of 'divide and rule',"HYDERABAD: Multi-crore fake stamp scam kingpin Mohammed Abdul Karim Telgi adopted the method of divide and rule to prevent any rebellion in his syndicate.

Telgi used the policy to control his crime syndicate across the country and enjoyed unquestioned authority, sources involved in the stamp scam probe said.

Telgi used to get three independent reports at the end of the day from three different persons of his syndicate working in each state. This was to check any manipulation by his men, the sources said.

Telgi never trusted any one person. Instead, Telgi made his men keep tabs on each other by making each of them believe that he was close to that individual, sources said.

The individual reports used to have the details of the orders received from various institutions seeking stamps, the quantity supplied and the money received. The reports also used to contain the description of expenses incurred on various counts, the sources said.

For instance, Telgi used to get three individual reports from his men in Hyderabad. Sadasiva, who had started the fake stamp sale for the first time in Hyderabad following Telgi''s instructions; Abdul Waheed, a relative of Telgi who was later made the in-charge of Hyderabad affairs, and Dastagir Kutbuddin Murghod, the marketing division in-charge of Andhra Pradesh, used to send separate reports, sources said, quoting from Abdul Wahed''s confession.

In fact, it was these individual reports that led to differences between Sadasiva and Dastagir, forcing Telgi to transfer Dastagir to Mumbai, sources said. Sources also said that Telgi never used to allow the same person to continue at one outlet for long. He used to shift the in-charge of each outlet frequently and ask them to start a new one. This was only to prevent the person from gaining control over the business, sources said. A similar method was applied across the country, and this helped Telgi maintain total control over his business, sources said.

However, Telgi was taken for a ride by Mohammed Abdul Waheed Quadri and Syed Hameed. The duo had taken fake stamps worth Rs 9 crore from Telgi and evaded payment, following which Telgi sent his man in the Maharashtra police Dilip Kamath to pick-up Hameed, sources said.

1,Poultry farmers seek to dispel bird flu scare,"LUDHIANA: Concerned over drastic fall in the egg and chicken meat business due to reports of bird flu, the poultry breeders claimed it was due to the scare among the consumers and as such the country is free of this disease.

The north zone chief executive of National Egg Coordination Committee, Ajit Singh on Sunday sought to dispel the fears of consumers claiming that India has been and continues to be free of the disease called Avian Influenza (AV) during the last four decades since organised poultry farming took roots in the country. He was addressing a news conference organised by North India Poultry Breeders Association here.

The Indian poultry industry is one of the most technologically advanced comparable to the best in the world, he said adding that Indian production infrastructure, indigenous disease surveillance and diagnostic facilities are highly sophisticated. Referring to Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center (PDRC) at Pune, he said it always placed emphasis on surveillance and monitoring of this disease in the border states to detect any possibility of cross-border infection. Apart from excellent facilities in the private sector, various government laboratories like Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, HDSL Bhopal, NIV Pune and National Institute of Communicable Diseases are world class and are manned by internationally reputed scientists, he said.

Meanwhile, Punjab Poultry Farms Association has urged the government to launch a massive campaign to dispel apprehensions about the presence of the disease in the state. The panic created by it has taken a heavy toll of their business. The association claimed the business had come down to half after the scare. There are 273 poultry farms in the state, which produce 65 lakh eggs daily, but they are suffering huge losses due to fall in consumption.

2,Lok Janshakti Party to contest Lok Sabha polls,"AHMEDABAD:The state unit of Lok Janshakti Party has decided to field candidates in Gujarat in forthcoming Lok Sabha elections after adjustments with like-minded parties.

A political resolution to this effect was passed at the meeting of the executive committee held here in presence of the partyâ€™s national secretary Prahlad Chauhan.

A spokesman of the party said that the final decision on electoral alliance would be taken by the party president Ramvilas Paswan, who reportedly was in constant touch with the leaders of the opposition. Only after the central leadership has discussed the political scenario in Gujarat with senior functionaries will it finalise its poll strategy, he added. Not certain on the number of seats the party would put up its candidates on, the spokesman said at the Sundayâ€™s meeting that a delegation of the state leaders will head for Delhi on Wednesday to apprise Paswan of the situation in the state.

3,"Hike income tax limit, BJP tells FM","NEW DELHI: Jaswant Singh is under siege. With two days to go for the vote-on-account, the finance minister is facing intense pressure from BJP colleagues to merge the dearness allowance (DA) of Central government employees with their basic salary and raise the income-tax exemption limit from the existing Rs 60,000 to at least Rs 75,000, if not a lakh.

He''s also being asked to widen the scope of farm sector insurance â€” currently restricted to crop insurance â€” to cushion farmers against income fluctuations.

Singh has so far held his ground, even appealing to the Prime Minister. But the BJP insists its feel-good campaign is more important than the state of the fisc, and is unwilling to buy the finance ministry''s arguments.

The ministry has been pointing out that the Fifth Pay Commission had dealt a crippling blow to state finances.

So it now wants the issue of DA entitlement of central government employees to be left to the National Development Council. Alternatively, it is ready to set up the Sixth Pay Commission to go into the matter.

However, the BJP leadership is determined to woo Central government employees, a crucial group which could hold the key to Delhi''s seven Lok Sabha seats.

Party leaders insist Singh make the announcement when he presents the interim budget, since ""post-dated cheques won''t work in poll season"".

Singh is reportedly more open to the demand to raise the I-T exemption limit, which squares well with his professed aim of putting more money into the hands of consumers.

Though he is hamstrung by the fact that tinkering with I-T rates can only be done through the Finance Bill, the BJP leadership is suggesting a way out. He could get around the stipulation by announcing his broad intent, thus dangling a lucrative carrot for voters.

The merger of DA with basic salary will cost the exchequer Rs 1,500 crore, but the BJP is determined to get its way.

It is unwilling to wait for a new Pay Commission, arguing that the panel would take at least three years to make its recommendations, which is of little use to a constituency clamouring for immediate relief.

Besides, the BJP leadership is convinced that no party would dare oppose a poll-time sop for Union government employees.

4,Mufti govt orders release of 34 detenus,"SRINAGAR: As the first effective follow-up of the talks between the Centre and Hurriyat Conference, the Jammu and Kashmir government on Sunday revoked the detention orders of 34 detenus on the eve of Eid festival, following the recommendation of a joint screening committee.

5,City lawyers split over Bleach issue,"KOLKATA: Pardoned off, Peter Bleach is now awaiting a clearance from the Mumbai court over a case pending against him. There has been no communication from the Centre till Sunday.

State home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said: ""There has been no further development in the matter.""

A senior official said the state will expedite legal matters from Monday. It will also move the court pleading withdrawal of the assault case pending against Bleach, and look into the legal aspects of Bleach''s petition pending before Calcutta High Court.

Lawyers, however, appear divided over the Bleach issue. Bikash Bhattacharjee, a lawyer at the high court, said: ""There is no doubt about Bleach''s involvement in terrorist activities. If UK and India are serious about curbing terrorism, they should have allowed the investigation and trial to take the natural course.

""Instead the government has decided to set a convict free. doubt whether the UK or the USA would have released an Indian convict with similar records.""

Bhattcharjee''s colleague Arunava Ghosh, however, said: ""The government has decided to withdraw the charges against Bleach following talks. And there is no denying that he has been discriminated morally if not legally by the government. Bleach should have been treated at par with the Latvians when the government released them,"" said Ghosh.

Gitanath Ganguly, executive chairman of the Legal Aid Services, echoed similar thoughts. ""I had once visited the jail as a special officer appointed by the high court.

""There I came to know that Bleach was suffering from a disease. He has been undergoing treatment ever since. Considering its repercussions in UK â€” a country that has diplomatic relations with India â€” the government could have released him earlier,"" Ganguly said.

6,J&K govt okays rehab policy for militants,"JAMMU/SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir government has approved the much-awaited rehabilitation policy to facilitate the return of militants to the mainstream.

The scheme, which has been cleared by the Central government, was cleared on Saturday by a state cabinet headed by deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma.

Under the scheme, a surrendered militant will be able to withdraw a rehabilitation incentive of Rs 1.50 lakh after spending three years of normal life. Further, a monthly stipend of Rs 2,000 will be paid to the surrendered militant.

The policy also envisages vocational training for self-employment at specified centres. This facility will be provided free of cost.

According to the Jammu and Kashmir chief secretary, those involved in heinous crimes will not be entitled to the benefits of the scheme.

The scheme will also not help militants who surrendered under the 1995 surrender policy, amended in 1997, but joined the ranks again later.

The government will, however, consider youths who had crossed the border and wanted to return home to lead a normal life. However, they won''t be provided all the incentives.

14,Civil aviation policy to be taken up on Feb 4,"NEW DELHI: The much-awaited Civil Aviation Policy, which among other things would allow private domestic carriers to fly abroad, will be taken up by the Union Cabinet on February 4, Civil Aviation Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy said on Monday.

""We will have a new Civil Aviation Policy shortly"", he told reporters after inaugurating a tourist facilitation counter at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here.

Replying to questions, he said several proposals on air connectivity and private and public sector airlines are likely to come up at the Cabinet meeting on that day.

Asked whether the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the aviation sector would also be addressed by the Cabinet, he said there were several proposals in front of the government and deliberations were required between Civil Aviation and some other ministries including Finance and Home Affairs.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, whose recommendations would form the basis for the new policy, has suggested 49 per cent FDI in the domestic airlines and up to 100 per cent in the helicopter services.

However, the sky is likely to be opened up only for those private airlines which have served in the domestic sector for a period of two years.

Rudy had earlier said that no new airline can suddenly emerge and immediately seek permission to fly abroad. They would have to put a minimum number of years in the domestic sector and operate a minimum number of services inside the country.

15,BJP will decide if it will rule alone: Vajpayee,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Prime Minister A B Vajpayee will not say if his party would rule solo or in coalition in the event of the BJP managing a simple manjority in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

Mr Vajpayee flew in the night to launch his maiden pre-poll â€œfeel goodâ€� mission in the South.

16,Tourism policy to regularise guesthouses,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi government wants more than 1,000 illegal guesthouses, most of them operating from residential areas, regularised. The government says this will help it promote tourism.

Urban planners, however, claim the move may deteriorate the quality of life as it will grant legitimacy to illegal commercial activity in colonies.

The proposal is a part of a draft policy prepared by the Delhi government to tackle the tourist rush during Commonwealth games. The proposal also talks of allowing commercial areas in the city to house hotels of up to 50 rooms and restaurant. Paying guest accommodation, right now available as licensed bread-n-breakfast joints are going to be encouraged. The plan talks of setting up two new five star hotels, five four-star hotels to prepare for the rush.

All major shopping and commercial centres are to have hotel and restaurant sites. Apart from this, land in institutional areas is also to be allowed for the construction of hotels.

Urban experts say the change in the by-laws and modification of the zone plans may not be in the jurisdiction of the tourism department. â€˜â€˜These things are decided by the Union urban development ministry, I donâ€™t know how far the department may be able to influence the Master Plan,â€™â€™ says K. T Ravindran, faculty member of the School of Planning and Architecture. â€˜â€˜Other than that, residential quality has to be maintained,â€™â€™ he adds. While tourism minister Arvinder Singh Lovely admitted that the proposals were under consideration, he said that the policy was still being finalised. â€˜â€˜There will be some additions and subtractions to the policy as it has been formulated,â€™â€™ he said.
