1,Traders block traffic to protest closed right turn,"new delhi: commuters were caught in a jam for over an hour near moolchand flyover following a face-off between the traffic police and traders protesting against the closure of the right turn into central market lajpat nagar from josip broz tito marg. traffic from nearby defence colony flyover and those heading towards it, had to be diverted because of the blockade by the traders. according to residents and members of the lajpat nagar tradersâ€™ association, closure of the turn was a major â€˜â€˜inconvenienceâ€™â€™. it was forcing them to take a tortuous route through already crowded lanes. â€˜â€˜we have been allowed entry through the krishna nagar and lal sai markets, both of which are narrow and perpetually jammed,â€™â€™ said sanjeev talwar, a resident of lajpat nagar-ii who runs a shop in central market. â€˜â€˜since these areas are largely residential with four-storey houses and several cars parked on the roads, the lanes become narrower,â€™â€™ he said. an executive member of the association said, the blocking of the turn had cordoned off the lajpat nagar area and made it chock-a-block. â€˜â€˜it has also increased the number of accidents,â€™â€™ he said. the traffic police, however, said the right turn was removed to clear the bottleneck on tito marg.

2,"Attack was politically motivated, says principal","new delhi: have colleges become political battlefields? after tuesdayâ€™s incident at aditi mahavidyalaya in bawana, where three students were arrested for allegedly beating up their college principal, it would seem so. the womenâ€™s college has been in turmoil for more than a week. but the story goes back a good six monthsâ€™ back, ever since the college union has been demanding affiliation to the delhi university studentsâ€™ union. the college is understood to have thwarted this. the students subsequently blocked roads and last week even went on a hunger strike. â€˜â€˜till now the principal changed rules for the college elections at her will,â€™â€™ said college president meena dabas. she is one of the three girls arrested. â€˜â€˜last year the principal had allowed only students with more than 50 per cent to contest the election.â€™â€™ the condition was withdrawn after students blocked roads and went on a dharna. â€˜â€˜the principal does not want the studentsâ€™ union to become powerful,â€� dabas said. following the protest in aditi mahavidyalaya, the college authorities agreed to a college union poll last week. this too, took a controversial turn, with the principal and the union president quote different figures for the number of students who cast their vote. the college version is that the union failed to secure the two-thirds majority required for an affiliation. referring to tuesdayâ€™s incident, dabas claimed one of the teachers started beating them up.the fight, dabas said, started because the college authorities were not returning identity cards taken on poll day. college principal sharda lal said the i-cards had been taken to keep a tab on the number of students who polled. â€˜â€˜it is a politically motivated ruckus,â€™â€™ she said. meanwhile, the dusu office witnessed an altercation. nsui member ajay nagpal alleged that a few members of abvp threatened him with a weapon. no case has been registered.

3,Polls in Punjab mark golden jubilee of elections in India,"new delhi: votes cast in the punjab assembly polls on wednesday marked the golden jubilee of elections in independent india. it has been a long journey for indiaâ€™s democracy since 1952 when the first lok sabha elections were held that led to the formation of a congress government led by prime minister jawahar lal nehru. along with the lok sabha elections, simultaneous polls were held to the legislative assemblies in states, a practice that continued till 1967. the simultaneous arrangement was disturbed with the early dissolution of lok sabha in 1971 and collapse of some state governments. since 1952, 13 general elections and scores of assembly polls have been conducted. in the 1952 elections, 61.16 per cent of the total 173.21 million voters across the country exercised their right to franchise, to elect 489 members of parliament as compared to a turnout of 60.02 per cent of the 618.11 million voters casting their ballot for 543 lok sabha seats in the last lok sabha elections in 1999. interestingly the expenditure has risen nearly 63 times, from a mere rs 104.6 million 50 years ago to a whopping rs 6530.1 million in 1999. the number of candidates also went up from 1,864 in the first elections to 4,648 in 1999 with the peak figure being 13,952 in 1996 after which the election commission took various measures, including hiking the security deposits to keep the number of contestants under check. while in 1952, there were 26 provinces, including patiala and east punjab states union (pepsu), hyderabad, saurashtra, ajmer, bhopal, bilaspur, coorg, travancore-cochin, vindya pradesh and madhya bharat, in the 1957 elections there were 17 states with reorganisation of states being conducted in 1956.today, there are 28 states, including uttaranchal, where assembly polls are being held for the first time, besides seven union territories. according to electoral records, the major parties in the fray in the first general elections were the congress, bharatiya jan sangh, swatantra party, cpi, and samyukta socialist party, with the congress bagging a vote share of 40.8 per cent. but in the 1999 lok sabha elections, the bjp, which came into being after the 1980 polls when atal behari vajpayee left the janata party, got a vote share of 23.7 per cent, besides 17 per cent secured by its allies, as against 28.3 per cent by the congress. as a result, the bjp and its allies won 303 seats in the 13th lok sabha as compared to 114 won by the congress.

4,Modi tells farmers to be pragmatic,"gandhinagar: strongly suggesting the need for power sector reforms just 10 days before the gujarat state assembly session, chief minister narendra modi told thousands of rural folk, mainly farmers, gathered here from north gujarat on wednesday that they ''cannot hope to enjoy free meals for long''. addressing a rally, called to felicitate 357 village sarpanches from the region, elected unanimously under the samras concept at the recent village local body polls, he said, the farmers of north gujarat were currently paying for the ''free meal'' offered to them by previous congress governments. ""you have to go as deep as 1,200 ft to pump out water your crop"", he said, indicating the huge power costs farmers have to incur. ""if you continue to enjoy a free meal even now, the future generations would suffer"", he added. the cm''s statement acquires significance against the backdrop of the state government''s plan to ensure that the electricity reforms bill is passed in the ensuing assembly session, to begin on february 23. the bill seeks to meter farm electricity and corporatise power transmission and distribution. this is the second statement by the cm in less than a week stressing his intention to go ahead with power reforms. last friday, speaking at the resurgent gujarat meet, he had admitted of recent slowdown in economic reforms in the state, declaring, he would shortly call a meeting of policy-makers and experts to go ahead with power sector reforms as his first priority. the cm''s stress on the reforms comes in the wake of asian development bank president tadao chino''s insistence to him on this. north gujarat farmers use the maximum share of 46 per cent of highly subsidised power, at 16 to 18 paise per unit. farm subsidy is the main reason for the huge rs 8,000 crore gujarat electricity board accumulated losses, a main stumbling block for attracting private power plants in the state. modi ensured farmers, he would do all he could to ensure that narmada waters reach north gujarat for irrigation. meanwhile, he asked them to save water by using such techniques as drip irrigation. an emotive issue, power sector reforms are being stiffly opposed by strong groups within the bjp, including minister of state for home gordhanbhai zadaphia and influential saurashtra mla saurabh patel, both of whom head geb unions. the congress, which had introduced unmetered, subsidised electricity regime in late 1980s, has also been opposing any move to charge higher for the electricity supplied to the farms. the bharatiya kisan sangh, the farmer wing of the bjp, also opposes the reforms. asking farmers to adopt modern ways, globalising the products of their villages, the cm said, one reason why the state farm sector has lagged behind is lack of emphasis on animal husbandry. ""we have stopped at producing milk. we must move forward"", he emphasised. ""we must produce natural manure out of gobar and produce farm products that do not use chemical fertilisers. such products have a lot of market in washington, new york, moscow and tokyo"", he said.

5,SP installed Vajpayee govt at Centre: IUML,"lucknow: indian union muslim league president gm banatwala said on wednesday that mulayam singh yadav was responsible for the installation of the vajpayee government at the centre. talking to reporters, the iuml president recalled that after the collapse of the 13-month rule of the bharatiya janata party government at the centre, the secular forces tried their best to cobble up an alternative front to prevent the bjp from coming to power. but the secular partiesâ€™ attempt was aborted by the rigid attitude of the samajwadi party president, said banatwala. the iuml president also held mulayam responsible for starting the practice of raiding madarsas and religious places in uttar pradesh. he said most parties in the past had joined hands with the bjp on several occasions. for instance, he said, first the so-called secular fores had joined hands with the bjp during the janata party experiment in the seventies. after that, he said, the second tie-up with the bjp came during the janata dal experiment. the iuml president said that those vishwa hindu parishad leaders who constantly harped that they would not abide by court orders with regard to construction of the ram temple at ayodhya, should be tried and prosecuted. â€œthe people who threatened to disregard court orders were â€˜terroristsâ€™,â€� he added. banatwala cited the instance of lahore where in the thirties the entire muslim community honoured the verdict of the court with regard to a disputed mosque. he also demanded that the eight senior leaders who had been absolved of all charges in the babri mosque demolition case should be tried again. he said the government should rectify the technical flaw which resulted in the invalidation of the government attempt to try them. the iuml, which is contesting 21 assembly seats in uttar pradesh, has asked the muslim community to support its candidates for making a strong bloc in the assembly. banatwala made it clear that under no circumstances his group would join hands with the bjp at any level.

6,Cong-NCP faceoff in zilla parishad polls,"mumbai: the congress and the nationalist congress party (ncp) are locked in a bitter battle in the ensuing zilla parishad elections scheduled on february 17.

demoralised by the results in the elections to the 10 major municipal corporations, both these parties are eager to win as many as possible of the 27 zilla parishads to boost the sagging morale of the rank and file.

maharashtra pradesh congress committee president govindrao adik is spearheading the congress campaign. he is touring the remote areas of the state. despite his party''s less-than-satisfactory performance in the municipal corporation elections, adik maintains that the congress was right in deciding to fight the polls on its own. ``mumbai was anyway a stronghold of the shiv sena. we could have achieved much more impressive results but for some lapses while selecting candidates,'''' he told tnn.

like adik, chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has also toured various parts of the state.

the zilla parishad elections are considered as mini general elections, a preliminary test of power for the political parties before facing the assembly elections. ``whoever controls these zilla parishads will fare well in the next assembly elections,'''' says adik.

the congress controls most of the zilla parishads, while the ncp has majority in four. adik addressed four meetings in four different districts on tuesday. he started from hingoli district and ended the day at vinchur in nashik. in hingoli, a tribal woman is the congress candidate for the presidentship. all the political parties are finding it difficult to get candidates in the reserved categories.

adik has been making an appeal to the voters to strengthen the hands of the chief minister to continue congress rule in the state. he talked about late prime minister rajiv gandhi''s decision to empower local self governments, like panchayat samitis and zilla parishads. he explained how money meant for rural development was siphoned off by power brokers.

deshmukh, who addressed a couple of public rallies in aurangabad, has stepped up his attack on the ncp during the campaign. both deshmukh and adik took potshots at ncp president sharad pawar for extensively campaigning in the rural parts of the state for the zilla parishad elections. ``congress president sonia gandhi is campaigning in up, punjab, uttaranchal, while the president of a so-called national party is roaming in small gullies in maharashtra,'''' adik said.

deshmukh also criticised pawar for aspiring to become the prime minister of the country with the help of seven mps. the tone and tenure of the congress campaign was aggressive.

unlike in the municipal corporation elections where the shiv sena-bharatiya janata party alliance was the major challenger, in the zilla parishad polls, the ncp is a formidable force to reckon with for the congress.

7,Cong not to support any party after the polls: Jogi,"lucknow: in a significant development, the congress on wednesday announced not to support any political party or front to form the next government in uttar pradesh. â€œthe party has decided not to support any political party if it failed to get the required numbers,â€� said jharkhand chief minister ajit jogi. the congress announcement may dash hopes of the samajwadi party chief mulayam singh yadav, who is relying on secular forces like congress to check the bjp from grabbing power again. the jharkhand chief minister, who was instrumental in causing a split in the bjp in his state, has made this clear to mulayam. â€œthere is no question of extending any support to mulayam singh yadav who stood in way of secular forces forming a government at the centre,â€� he said, talking to the times news network. jogi held mulayam responsible for vajpayee to become the prime minister again. and congress president sonia gandhi seems to have not forgotten this. when pressed again about congressâ€™ post-poll role, jogi clarified: â€œthis decision to stand alone has been taken at the highest level and there is no question of any change.â€� an over-confident jogi said that the winds were blowing in favour of the congress in the state. â€œpeople want change as the five-year misrule of the bjp government has relegated the state to the bottom of the development chart,â€� he pointed out. â€œan undercurrent is blowing in favour of the congress and it will not be surprisng if poll outcome in uttar pradesh shock all political parties,â€� he claimed. on partyâ€™s star campaigner priyanka gandhi vadra staying away from the partyâ€™s poll campaign, jogi clarified that â€œher family circumstances were not permitting her to campaign for the party but she is always there in the hour of any crisis. on sonia not as actively campaigining in uttar pradesh, jogi said that she has already addressed more meetings than even prime minister and many more are planned.

8,Is patriotism in Kolkata flagging?,"kolkata: for those who believed thousands would rush to the rooftops to fly the national flag, it is a disappointment. nearly a month after the january 16 supreme court ruling that ended 54 years of curbs on flying the tricolour, only a handful of kolkata residents made an effort to display their patriotism. for many, the verdict has yet not registered. for some, the rules are not yet clear. and there are many who just don''t bother. ""i don''t have to fly the flag to show my patriotism,"" says sushil choudhury of sarat bose road. ""it is good for the box-office. the indian audience laps up the patriotic fervour in movies like border and gadar,"" says shyamali ghosh, a teacher. this is unlike the americans, who are so passionate about their stars & stripes. ""it is an abstract representation of the freedom struggle. everyone takes it personally. ''i am proud to be an american'' â€” that''s how americans feel,"" explains american center director rex moser. he, however, admits that the upsurge of patriotism following the september 11 attacks has taken the american flag to new heights. in france too, the tricolour is everywhere. but then, you''d have trouble spotting the flag in vietnam and laos. businessman harsh neotia who has been flying it in front of his office for two years now, feels that it will take time for change to sink in. ""you cannot expect everyone to fly the flag after so many years of being told not to do it,"" he says. neotia now plans to fly the flag at all his factories and establishments as well as at his residence. neotia got inspiration from his friend naveen jindal who had fought for the right to fly one''s flag. ""i felt this was a truly valuable cause. flying the national flag is a very important symbol of one''s identity with one''s own country. it instils a sense of pride,"" he says. bengal initiative chairman amiya gooptu says people are, perhaps, not aware of the decision. ""there''s also the fear that has set in about committing an offence. many people i know have not tried to fly it because they don''t have the guidelines yet,"" he says. in case it''s the rules you are waiting for, here they are. the supreme court has allowed every indian national to fly the flag maintaining a code of conduct: â€¢ the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset and brought down every evening and kept properly. â€¢ the flag must be respected. it must not be flown if it is damaged or torn and must be replaced immediately. â€¢ certain proportions regarding the length and the width of the flag and its exact colour and shade should be maintained. â€¢ while flying, the saffron band should be on top.

""an important aspect of achieving this is to strengthen the provision relating to permanent account numbers (pan) and streamline the process of speedy issuing by upgrading the systems,"" it said. total tax revenue was only 52.1 per cent at rs 84,996 crore in the first nine months of the current fiscal as against the targeted collection of rs 163,031 crore for the whole year. on various deductions and allowances, the chamber said these were fixed long way back and need immediate revision and the tax benefit on medical treatment should be raised to rs 25,000 from the existing rs 15,000. on the issue of payments made to employees seeking vrs, cii asked for amendments on the one-time exemption available to individuals to the extent of rs five lakhs. ""one-time payment of vrs dues acts as a burden for corporates which are restructuring their workforce,"" it said. to provide a tax shield to the individuals opting for vrs, provisions of one-time deductibility should be revised, it said. on house building loan, the chamber said treating it as a perquisite would defeat the very purpose of social objective. on the condition that an individual has to acquire or construct a house within the period of april 1, 1999, cii said there was a need for extending the time limit by another three years to provide a boost to the housing sector.
