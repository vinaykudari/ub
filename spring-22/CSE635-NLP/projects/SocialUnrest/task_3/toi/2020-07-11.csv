0,Bakery was 37th riot acquittal,"AHMEDABAD: Imtiaz Khan (26) lost most of his family in the Gulbarg society massacre, where 42 persons, including Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, were killed by a mob after the Godhra incident.

After the Best Bakery verdict, he is afraid to answer his cell-phone.

His friend answers his calls, screens the caller thoroughly and only when assured it is not someone from the VHP or Bajrang Dal, does he hand over the phone to Khan. Such is the fear among the victims who have still to testify in cases which are yet to come up for trial.

What many do not know about the infamous Best Bakery case is that it was the 37th of the post-Godhra riot cases in Gujarat where the accused were acquitted after trials. The Bakery case just got famous because it was one of the five massacres picked by the NHRC to be probed by the CBI.

However, there have already been 36 riot cases where trials have been conducted and the accused were acquitted since the witnesses either did not turn up or they turned hostile.

When TNN finally got through to Imtiaz Khan, he was still wary, ""We have been asked not to speak to anyone, they could be from the VHP, who knows?"" he says. Only when assured, does he manage to say, ""We are all strong and will stand by our statements, none of us will retract our statements.""

But not all are hopeful. At least not the chairman of the Gulbarg Society â€” Yusuf Patel who moved to Gandhinagar on February 27 last year, a day before the massacre.

""Our people too have been threatened and this case too might go the Bakery way,"" he says.

The more striking among the acquittals is that of the Limbadiya chowk massacre, where some 34 persons were allegedly burnt alive in Panchmahals and where the prime accused was Kalu Maliwad who was acquitted just before the assembly elections.

Maliwad went on to represent the Lunawada constituency in Panchmahals as a BJP MLA and is said to have enthralled crowds during his election campaign with statements like, ""I went to jail for all of you.""

Maliwad was also the prime accused in the Kidiyad massacre of Panchmahals where some 73 persons were allegedly burnt alive on March 2 last year. ""Most of the trials were conducted in fast-track courts in the district where all the accused were acquitted,"" said a source.

In fact, most of the witnesses did not even dare to testify before the court and did not turn up at all in the Limbadiya case. And 90 per cent of the 23,000 arrested are out on bail, another reason for the victims to be scared.

Of the 4,252 cases that were filed between February and May 2002, 2,032 cases were disposed of by the police because there was no evidence to establish their culpability, while in 21 cases the complaints were found to be baseless.

1,VHP to Govt: Enact law on Ram temple or face stir,"NEW DELHI: The VHP-backed Ram Mandir Andolan Samiti passed a resolution on Friday at the end of a day-long brainstorming session here, which sources said, gave the Vajpayee government an ultimatum: If it did not bring in a legislation in Parliament to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya by September 14, a five-man committee will decide on the VHPâ€™s future course of action.

The action could include anything from stepping up a mass agitation to demanding the resignation of the government. However, these sources added that if the government did make an attempt to bring in the legislation on the subject and fell in the process, necessitating a snap poll, the BJP would be assured of unstinted support from the VHP during the polls.

The sources added that a formal announcement was postponed till Saturday to give RSS chief KS Sudarshan time to brief the Vajpayee government on the decision and to convey the â€˜â€˜angerâ€™â€™ of the VHP and the â€˜â€˜sant samajâ€™â€™ on the issue, particularly the fact that in the recent government-sponsored efforts to resolve the issue through the Kanchi Shankaracharya, the VHP was left out altogether.

VHP functionary Pravin Togadia, when asked why the VHP had deferred the announcement, said cryptically: â€˜â€˜To give us time to assess the impact on the polity of our decision.â€™â€™ But later, sources explained it was to give the RSS leadership time to convey the VHPâ€™s decision to the government. The RSS has fully backed the VHP line, but advised it not to publicly attack the BJP top brass. The BJP has thus far said it does not have the numbers to bring in the legislation as its NDA partners are opposed to it.

Further, since it has decided to contest the next elections as part of the NDA, an attempt to bring in a legislation would ensure the demise of the coalition, something it cannot afford. The VHPâ€™s offer â€” that if the government falls on the legislation, it would back the BJP electorally is â€” analysts feel, virtually amounts to asking the BJP to choose between the Sangh Parivar and its NDA partners.

Fridayâ€™s meeting, was attended, among others, by VHP supremo Ashok Singhal and its senior vice-president Giriraj Kishore, RSS chief KS Sudarshan, RSS general secretary Mohan Bhagwat and joint secretary in-charge of the BJP Madan Das Devi. They also discussed Kashi and Mathura, reiterating the fact that the VHP would not give up its claim to these two sites even if the Muslims gave up their claim to the disputed site in Ayodhya in exchange.

The meeting also decided it would ask the government to enact a Central law to ban cow slaughter in the forthcoming monsoon session of Parliament.

4,"Screens go blank, govt steps in to end impasse","BANGALORE: Even as films were forcibly taken off screens at theatres all over the state, the state government on Friday had separate meetings with Kannada producers and exhibitors in an effort to resolve the deadlock between the two.

Information minister Allum Veerabhadrappa, who met exhibitors in the morning and the producers in the evening, told The Times of India: ""They have both placed their grievances in front of me. Each one is blaming the other for their problems. I have called a joint meeting with both of them, along with office-bearers of the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) on Monday to discuss the issue.""

The shutdown of theatres was total in Bangalore city and partial in other parts of the state. Producers are in the process of taking back their prints from every theatre, including those in North Karnataka, producer-director Joe Simon said.

Both sides continued to stick to their stand on the basic issue of service tax. ""It is our legal right to collect it. Even the minister or the government cannot change this particular point, after the chief minister announced the tax in the state budget as one meant exclusively for theatre maintenance,"" Sagar theatre exhibitor Rajesh H. Patel pointed out.

An exhibitor said theatres were forcibly closed down in Friday because producers had made the service tax issue an ego hassle. ""Their demands are never going to end. They asked us to cut our rentals by 10 per cent last year, we obliged. But they claim we have not done it. If the films run on profit, they have no problems, if it is a loss, they fight with us, despite the fact that our expenses are the same, either way,"" he rued.

The situation in small-town theatres, which have very low rentals, would be severe if the service tax was also taken away. ""I had to pay Rs 25 lakh to run the film Kutumbha in my theatre. State-wide, the service tax collected for this film is just Rs 30 lakh,"" Patel stated.

5,HC order to govt on meals scheme,"BANGALORE: A division bench of the Karnataka high court on Friday observed that the state government should implement to purpose, the Akshara Dasoha (midday meal) scheme for which it was launched.

This was made following a petition filed by a city advocate stating that the scheme had become a nightmare causing a health hazard with hundreds of children falling ill after consuming the low-quality food.

The bench comprising Chief Justice N.K. Jain and Justice H.G. Ramesh, however, dismissed the petition and passed the directions.

In his petition, Raghumohan Reddy stated that the scheme, to provide free food to school children in rural areas, should be implemented in the proper manner as low quality food was being supplied leading to several children falling ill. Children are scared to attend school and the scheme costing huge amounts has attracted middlemen, the petitioner contended.

9,CPM expels 32 rural party members,"KOLKATA: The CPM has expelled 32 party members for indulging in unprincipled alliances with other political parties during the recently held panchayat polls, in order to capture power in the gram panchayats.

CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said unless party members rectified their mistakes within August 15, all such grams panchayats would be derecognised by the party. Such alliances had taken place in 13 gram panchayats.

As many as 12 members have been expelled from the CPMâ€™s faction-ridden North 24 Parganas unit.

Insisting that the party would, under no circumstances, encourage unprincipled activities during formation of boards in the gram panchayats, Biswas said it would give more importance to ideology than capturing of boards in panchayats.

B Anuradha, a resident of Aparajita Colony in Ameerpet, rushed to the police station, her hand bleeding, and lodged a complaint in the afternoon saying that her in-laws B Radhakrishna Murthy, Rangamani and sister-in-law B Anitarani, slashed her hand with a kitchen knife and then tried to set her afire when her husband Chandini Kumar was away from home.

12,Minority engg colleges flout govt order,"HYDERABAD: About 12 minority engineering colleges and two pharmacy colleges have reportedly begun admission process much before the mandatory counselling.

The government issued an order stating that counselling for engineering students will begin from July 18 and has permitted private engineering colleges to start their admissions from that date. However, some of the minority colleges are reported to have started the process in June itself.

According to GO Ms 34, the minority professional institutions should issue a notification in all leading newspapers inviting applications along with the cost of the application, seats available in each course, eligibility criterion and the fee.

The order also states that the application forms should be made available at reasonable cost to the candidates at the sale counter of the colleges concerned and at the offices of principal secretary of minority welfare department, technical education commissioner and AP State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE) secretary.

But students complained that many minority colleges under Planning, Co-ordination and Monitoring Board for Minorities (PCMB) had conducted admissions and also collected fees without issuing admission forms at these counters or giving any notification. The PCMB had declared its counselling dates for admission through MEMCET (minority engineering, medical common entrance test) rank cards, while also asking for EAMCET ranks, the students complained.

â€œThe admission notification covers all professional colleges, minority and non-minority, and any admissions done prior that will not be valid,â€� APSCHE secretary Prof V Jayarami Reddy said.

â€œAs the minority welfare department is the regulatory authority for minority institutions, it will monitor the admissions in such colleges,â€� technical education commissioner Ar Sukumar said.

13,"Explain ambiguities, govt tells Star","NEW DELHI: In the light of ""discrepancies"" detected in Star News''s compliance with the national up-linking policy, the government has decided to ""revise and revisit"" its guidelines in order to ensure strict compliance with the 26 per cent cap on foreign equity in news channels.

Information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad made the announcement on Saturday after a meeting with Prime Minister Vajpayee, Deputy P M Advani, finance minister Jaswant Singh, external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha and law minister Arun Jaitley.

The I & B ministry has written a tersely worded letter to Star seeking clarifications about the share structure of Star News Broadcasting Ltd. (SNBL) and the level of adherence to the up-linking guidelines.

The Centre''s new stance comes in the wake of allegations that Star is attempting to circumvent strict FDI limits in broadcasting by the use of corporate veils.

Though the government action followed the Indian broadcasters'' joint statement alleging denial of a level playing field, ministry sources claimed that ""many things came to light in the files from the beginning.""

The ministries of law, company affairs and I & B would hold consultations about the foreign channels'' equity structure and remittances pattern. ""Revision is needed to ensure that the 26 per cent foreign equity clause in the policy is adhered to,"" Prasad said.

Among the clarifications sought from Star News is the vital question about SNBL remaining the majority share holder despite its 26 per cent stake. ""The other share holders do not appear to have representation on the Board of Directs,"" the ministry remarked. While one company with a 25 per cent share has one director, another with an equal stake does not have one.

It asked how Media Content and Communications Services, the current content provider for Star News, is honouring its financial obligations with a paid up capital of just Rs. 1 lakh. ""For individual shareholders, no financial details are available to see if they can invest the required amount,"" the ministry said.

It wanted to know about the present owner of Star News, share holding of the foreign company SNBL and funds-flow statements for the past year.

In related developments, two persons of the Delhi-based company producing the pills were arrested by police here, while Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal ordered confiscation of the alleged â€œdefamatoryâ€� materials.

Bhujbal, who also holds the Home portfolio, asked the company to clarify its stand on promotion of the product.

A handful of protestors pelted stones near Bandra railway station here, police said. However, no one was arrested as they ran away from the scene when police arrived. No one was injured in the stone-pelting, police added.

Two executives of the company were arrested today at suburban Bandra on the charge of inciting religious sentiments of the people through the advertisement. They were booked under the relevant section of the IPC.
