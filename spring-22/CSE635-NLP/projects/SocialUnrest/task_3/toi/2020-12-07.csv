0,Cong yet to learn modern politics,"NEW DELHI: There is an engaging paradox about the two principal parties in India. The BJPâ€™s Hindutva platform and its communally divisive politics are as backward as any in the country, but its political organisation is perhaps the most modern.

On the other hand, the Congressâ€™ message of secularism is progressive, but its dynastic leadership belongs to the Middle Ages.

But while there are forces within the BJP seeking to modernise its message as well, any effort to democratise the Congress is ruthlessly crushed. An unnamed Congress CM once put it this way, â€˜â€˜Our party is a private company belonging to Sonia Gandhi, and anyone who canâ€™t live with it, can leave,â€™â€™ adding for good measure, â€˜â€˜Just as you can leave your company if you donâ€™t like the idea of working with its proprietor.â€�

The CM was mixing two universes â€” private proprietorships remain the cutting edge in the business world, but are out of date in politics. At any given time, we can count some half-a-dozen BJP leaders who can credibly aspire to become the head of the firm in the coming years, but when you look at the Congress, the options seem limited to the bossâ€™ family.

But as her detractors within the party know, it is easy to hit out at Sonia, but itâ€™s not at all easy to propose an alternative. The downward drift of the party in the Sitaram Kesri years is well known. It was salvaged by Sonia. She didnâ€™t make it a private proprietorship, Indira Gandhi did.

The problems with Congress are many. The party has not understood alliance politics, and if the mediaâ€™s experience is anything to go by, Sonia remains an aloof person. She does have the option to change the party from a private to a public limited company. But, itâ€™s not that easy.

Private ownership provides scope for a freer run of entrepreneurial talent and decisive management. Going public adds stakeholders who can provide resources for expansion, but they can also diffuse the focus. But there is a time in the life of every company when the question comes up â€” stay private or go public. And if ever there was time for Congress, it seems to be now.

1,Oppn set to mount attack on DF govt,"NAGPUR: Though chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde brushed aside any talk of the DF government being under threat, the opposition Shiv Sena-BJP combine is likely to test the governmentâ€™s mettle in the winter session from Monday.

For starters, the opposition will move a breach of privilege motion against deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal for â€œmisleadingâ€™â€™ the legislature in the fake stam paper scam.

Mr Bhujbal â€œmisledâ€™â€™ the house while replying to a discussion on the scam in the house in March 2003, alleged opposition bigwigs Narayan Rane of the Sena and Nitin Gadkari of the BJP, while announcing the saffron brigadeâ€™s boycott of the CMâ€™s customary tea party to mark the start of the winter session.

â€œMr Bhujbal,who heads the home department, had given a clean chit to former police commissioner R.S. Sharma who has been arrested under MCOCA in connection with the scam,â€™â€™ said Mr Rane.

2,SAD pitches protest rally as anti-govt morcha,"PATIALA: Itâ€™s no longer simply a rally to protest the arrest of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir.

Neither is it a rally driven solely by the resolve of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) workers to expose the repression unleashed by the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government.

In a strategic move, the SAD spin doctors have reinvented the â€˜anti-repressionâ€™ rally to be held at Patiala on Monday.With nine more issues thrown into its steaming cauldron, the rally has now been converted into a broader anti-government morcha that will now expose failures of the state government on other fronts.

In a call to the people, the organisers of the rally have projected Badal as a holy man a fighter, who has been targeted under the â€˜â€˜stateâ€™s repression campaign initiated against thousands of selfless workers and leaders of the SAD.

Labelling the Congress as â€˜anti-Panth,â€™ the organisers alleged that for the last two years the Punjab government had â€˜â€˜let loose state repression on all Punjabis.â€™â€™ They alleged that it had desecrated gurdwaras by sending policemen inside them and tried to interfere in religious matters of the Sikhs.

In a bid to rope in farmers in this crusade, the organiers said that the government had increased the burden on farmers through levies on canal water, electricity and revenue tax.

In trying to drum mass support for its cause, the SAD has not forgotten its its ally Bharatiya Janata Party and its constituency of urban voters. The SAD said that the government â€˜â€˜has betrayed the urbanites by imposing octroi, house tax and exim forms.â€™â€™

Going a step further, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) has made an effort to involve the government employees, students, dalits and even the exservice men. In the call given to the people to attend the rally, the party said that the government stopped salary and other perks of employees, it stopped â€˜Shagun schemeâ€™ for the Dalits, hiked college fee of students and stopped facilities for ex-servicemen.

In short, there is something for everything in this rally. The Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) wants to use this rally as a show of strength for which all out efforts are being made. They have exhorted people to attend the rally in large numbers so that an â€˜â€˜anti-repression public movementâ€™â€™ could be launched.

3,"George, Dhindsa to attend rally","PATIALA: NDA convener and Union defence minister George Fernandes, Union textiles minister Shahnawaz Hussain, Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, minister of state for home I D Swami, BJP spokesman Vijay Malhotra, Punjab BJP president Avinash Rai Khanna, two former BJP ministers Madan Mohan Mittal and Balramji Dass Tandon would attend the SAD rally to be organised here on Monday against the arrest of SAD chief Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir. They would later meet the two in the jail.

Stating here on Sunday, former SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar said that more than 1,000 Akali workers had already reached Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib.

He alleged that contrary to the assurances given by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh that the rally would not be disrupted, the police was conducting raids and arresting Akali leaders as well as workers throughout the state.

He claimed that nakas had been erected at many places and at Bhawanigarh naka, person was being allowed pass through without being thoroughly checked.

4,Judge to probe Old City riots,"HYDERABAD: The government announced a judicial probe into the riots that shook the Old City on Saturday and clamped an indefinite curfew in eight police station limits â€” Shahalibanda, Moghalpura, Bhavani Nagar, Chatrinaka, Mirchowk, Rein Bazar, Dabeerpura and Falaknuma â€” even as the toll rose to five persons dead and 25 injured.

No major incidents of rioting were reported in the affected areas by late Sunday night except some stone-pelting in Attapur which was unrelated to Saturdayâ€™s flare-up.

However, the curfew is unlikely to be relaxed till Monday evening, police said. Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu accompanied by home minister T Devender Goud, commercial taxes minister K Vijayarama Rao and senior police officials visited the riothit areas on Sunday morning.

Announcing the judicial probe, he said that those who planned the riots or took part in them would face stern charges under the AP Control of Organised Crime Act.

Referring to the disruption of power supply by the rioters, he said the forensic experts would be asked to collect fingerprints.

The chief minister interacted with the residents of Gowlipura, Sultanshahi, Nasheman Nagar and Moghalpura and promised steps to restore normalcy. He also visited the Osmania General Hospital.

He also said the government may consider giving ex gratia payments to the families of those killed in the riots.Twenty-one platoons of the Armed Police and Rapid Action Force have been deployed in the riothit areas to maintain peace, he said.

After reviewing the situation with Goud, police commissioner R P Singh and other top police officials, Naidu said, â€œSome people appear to have planned these riots for their personal benefit. We will take strong action against them and we will not spare anyone.â€�

5,Cricket matches spark two incidents of violence,"VADODARA: The city witnessed two incidents of violence on Saturday which were sparked off by cricket matches. One of them, at Gorwa, turned communal and led to stone-pelting. At least five persons were injured.

Groups from two different communities indulged in stone pelting after a verbal altercation during a night cricket match. The police fired at least five teargas shells to disperse the mob which was going berserk. According to the Gorwa police, the incident took place after a petty argument over a run-out call by the umpire. It was the final of a tournament in the communally sensitive area.

Heated arguments between the two teams followed and persons from Gorwa allegedly instigated youth from nearby slums to indulge in fisticuffs. When police arrived, members of both communities allegedly started pelting stones on the policemen. The five injured were admitted to a local hospital. The Gorwa police registered an offence for rioting.

Vadodara police commissioner Sudhir Sinha said, â€œThe incident occurred after a rumour in the minority community that a boy had been pulled aside by members of another community. This was not true. The police fired a few teargas shells to control the situation.â€� According to Sinha, such events turn violent as youth play with a lot of passion and tempers tend to run high, leading to small instances of violence.

In another incident of violence in Savli taluka, four persons including a woman assaulted a teacher of a school. According to Savli police, Govind Rana, Buddhi Sagar, Hira Rana and Kamala Ravji assaulted Gita Ravji in her class. The complaint registered stated that Gita''s son had allegedly entered into a verbal duel with a relative of the four assailants during a cricket match about a fortnight ago. The assault on Gita followed a series of threat calls issued to her over the phone. The Savli police arrested all the four accused.

6,"The govt giveth, and then it taketh away","AHMEDABAD: Vipul Shahâ€™s world collapsed around him on January 26, 2001. Close to the three years after the killer quake rocked Gujarat, Shah is dreading its worst aftershock.

The district collectorate has begun issuing recovery notices to those victims who have received compensation from the state government but have not yet completed constructing a new home. This has left Shah and about 350 households in the lurch as, of the 72 multi-storeyed buildings that collapsed in Ahmedabad, about 25 are yet to be constructed. They housed about 350 flats.

According to data compiled by the Home Losersâ€™ Service Association of Ahmedabad (HOLSAA), 25 quake-hit buildings such as â€˜Shikharâ€™, â€˜Sundervanâ€™ and â€˜Padmashreeâ€™ remain unconstruc0ted. HOLSAA figures say that while 22 buildings like â€˜Akshardeep Apartmentâ€™, â€˜Akshayâ€™ and â€˜Chittvanâ€™ have been completely reconstructed, 26 buildings like â€˜Himgiriâ€™ and â€˜Sangemarmarâ€™ are in the process of being reconstructed.

â€œWe have begun issuing notices to people who have received the financial aid to reconstruct their homes but have not done anything so far,â€� says Ahmedabad district collector Anita Karwal. The collectorate has sought HOLSAAâ€™s help to act as a facilitator to solve the problem. â€œItâ€™s a Catch-22 situation for all. Some residents have a genuine problem. But we too have our own constraints,â€� she adds. According to sources in the collectorate, a large chunk of the grant had come from the World Bank and that is the reason the state has taken up the issue on a war footing.

â€œQuake victims have received 90 per cent of the Rs 1.75 lakh pledged by the government as compensation. They will get the remaining amount after they produce the building use permission,â€� says Shrikant Shah of HOLSAA. Shah feels that in many cases, people have not rebuilt houses due to a funds crunch, despite the compensation amount. â€œThere are other reasons too â€” in many societies, not all flatowners are willing to contribute the expense of reconstruction. Then, many victims do not have proper documents and builders donâ€™t cooperate,while some have run out of money because they have to pay rent after having lost all in the quake,â€� he says. Vipul Shah, who had a house in â€˜Shikharâ€™, now stays in a rented accommodation.

â€œI have heard of notices being issued. Ours is a middle-class household and refunding the amount will be difficult because we have used it up. Moreover, I am still hopeful that â€˜Shikharâ€™ will be reconstructed,â€� he says. MS Shanker, an engineer who had a house in â€˜Padmashree Apartmentâ€™ in Navrangpura, has changed three rented flats after his building collapsed.

â€œThe government is acting in an inhumane manner. Instead of going after the errant builders, they are harassing common people who have suffered. We are ready to return the money if the government constructs earthquakeresistant houses for us,â€� says Shanker, whose compensation money has been spent paying rents. Absence of a proper nodal agency to coordinate the process has also affected the victims. â€œMany of us are willing to go for reconstruction but there have been problems. We need a body to coordinate among the parties concerned,â€� says a resident of â€˜Padmashree Apartmentâ€™.

7,Dacoity foiled with arrests and foreign arms haul,"KOLKATA: Police arrested a five-member gang on Saturday from near Tiljala and seized a huge cache of arms, including Chinese and Italian revolver bullets of various bores.

Mohammed Ansarul alias Ansal, Mohammed Inamul alias Babloo, Mohammed Manwar, Vinod Kumar, Mohammed Sajid alias Jhunnu were arrested.

Police said the gang had planned a major crime on Friday night.

Khan Road.â€�

Police found a few men loitering around and exchanging signals. â€œWe kept a close watch and as soon as the entire gang assembled, we swooped on them.

â€œAfter the arrest, it was found they had more sophisticated arms and ammunitions than us,â€� Chatterjee said.

More raids are likely as the gang is believed to be big â€œWe have gathered some information after interrogating the gang. We will conduct more raids as the gang is based in Topsia,â€� said an officer.

8,Peace and development are inter-linked: Minister,"PATNA: The third Bihar State Conference of Indian Doctors for Peace and Development (IDPD) was held on Sunday at the IMA hall. Eminent doctors of Bihar, medical students and senior representatives of IDPD attended the conference.

Minister for medical education Shakeel Ahmad inaugurated the conference. Speaking on the occasion, he said that peace and development are inter-linked with each other. He said that the formation of a unipolar world after the failure of communism in USSR and other countries of Eastern Europe continues to be a threat to world peace.

â€œThe country which is pressurising others to sign the CTBT has itself used weaponry having attributes of nuclear warheads in the recent war on Iraq,â€� he stated.

â€œBreach of peace always starts in the mind. In our country, efforts are being made to distort the thinking of the general public which may create disturbing situations,â€� he rued. He said that even the mindset of people belonging to higher classes of society is very narrow when it comes to Pakistan. It was India, which forced Pakistan to join the nuclear club after its nuclear explosion in 1998.

â€œThe amount of nuclear weaponry present on the earth can destroy the planet many times over,â€� said IDPD national president Dr L S Chawla. He also said that if such weapons get into the hold of terrorists, they would show no hesitation in using it.

He also reflected on the fact that three children die every minute in Africa because of hunger and on the other hand Rs 16,000 crore is spent per day on development of weapons in the world.

Indian Medical Association of Medical Specialty chairman Dr D K Choudhary said that the manifesto of politicians includes issues like health, education, roads etc, but once the election is over they forget all about this.

9,NDA calls bandh tomorrow for ousted DGP,"PATNA: The removal of D P Ojha from the post of Bihar DGP by the state government on Saturday took a somewhat serious turn on Sunday with the opposition NDA giving a call for the state bandh on December 9 to protest the government action.

The LJP has also given a call for the state bandh on the day.

The NDA workers would take out a torchlight procession on Monday in all the districts in protest against the removal of Ojha. The BJP workers observed Sunday as â€œblack dayâ€� in the entire state. Over 650 BJP workers, led by state BJP president Gopal Narayan Singh, courted arrest in Patna while staging a demonstration on the issue. Singh said over 20,000 BJP workers observed â€œblack dayâ€� in different districts.

An NDA delegation will on Monday call on governor M Rama Jois to demand the dismissal of Rabri Devi government for its â€œanti-nationalâ€� acts. NDA state convenor Nand Kishore Yadav said the NDA delegation would also call on PM Vajpayee and deputy PM Advani after December 9 to demand the dismissal of Rabri government. He said essential services will not be disturbed during the bandh. However, the NDA would not allow trains to move.

Charging the state government with extending patronage to RJD MP from Siwan, Mohd Shahabuddin ignoring his alleged ISI connection and link with international criminal gangs, Nand Kishore demanded institution of a fresh case against Shahabuddin. By extending patronage to Shahabuddin, the state government has proved that it has compromised on the issue of national integrity for political considerations, he said, adding the Centre cannot ignore the fact that Bihar is a state bordering Nepal and Bangladesh.

Nand Kishore also referred to the submission of a 100-page report submitted by Ojha to the state government giving details of alleged ISI connection and criminal links of Shahabuddin. He said Ojha has exposed the nexus among police, politician and criminal in the state. It is evident from the fact that the government is yet to hand over to the CBI the probe of Gopalganj bank dacoity, in which Ojha had alleged the Siwan MPâ€™s involvement, he said, adding the government has also not yet moved the court to seek trial of cases involving the MP outside Bihar.

The BJP leaders said that inviting Ojha to join the BJP was not at all on the partyâ€™s agenda. â€œItâ€™s a hypothetical question,â€� Nand Kishore said.
