3,"By-polls, a self-assessment for BJP: Rana","surat: the by-elections in rajkot-2, sayajigunj and mahuva assembly constituencies on thursday would be a self-assessment for the ruling bjp of the recent initiatives taken by the party high command to bridge the gap among different groups and strengthening its organisational structure. keeping in mind the growing perception that bjp has lost its hold in the state, a fact substantiated by pointing towards the recent poll debacle in sabarkantha and sabarmati and the erosion of the party''s base in the zilla panchayat elections, the electoral battle for these three seats will be a test for the bjp. union textiles minister and city mp kashiram rana, who was on his way to address voters in mahuva on tuesday, told tnn that these by-elections will prove to be an exercise to rejuvenate the party across the state and keep its hold intact. he, however, admitted that the party was a little overconfident, which was the reason behind the poll debacle in sabarmati and sabarkantha. various groups within the party felt the need to overcome internal differences. this could be possible by bringing in various measures, rana said. he added that these by-elections will help to tighten the loose ends within the party and to instil a new sense of confidence among its leaders and workers. on rajkot-2, rana said it would be a cake-walk for modi and would win with a margin of over 29,000 votes. he said the congress could not give a fitting match to the bjp there, as the party (congress) did not have any issue to talk about before the people. instead, congress leaders have resorted to character-assassination of modi, but these tricks won''t help as people now know about the hollowness within the congress. even in sayajigunj, the bjp would win as its candidate jitubhai sukhadia is well accepted among voters, he said. when asked about any erosion in their voter base due to samajwadi party candidate and former bjp minister jaspal singh contesting from there, rana said voters know that singh is an opportunist and had left bjp for not being given a ministerial berth by modi. referring to mahuva assembly by-election, rana said bjp candidate manubhai patel is far ahead of congress nominee ishwarbhai wahia. moreover, voters in this tribal-dominated constituency know that for the last 45 years nothing had been done towards the upliftment of the poor people of the region. however, several developmental works initiated during the last five years have given hope to the people here. only the bjp could bring in an all-round prosperity to this region, he added. the bjp must win all these seats by keeping in view the forthcoming assembly elections early next year, rana said. he was confident that all the necessary efforts put in by the party will lead to its victory.

``talks are on in this regard,'''' mr munde told presspersons on wednesday, referring to the reported unrest among smaller df constituents and the independent mlas supporting the eight-party coalition government.

when mr rane said the government would not survive another two months, mr munde interjected: ``say less than 15 days.'''' however, they refused to reveal their strategy to oust the vilasrao deshmukh government.

when mr munde was reminded that he had made similar claims in the past also, he said, ``now the attitude of the df constituents towards our alliance has changed. also, congress workers are disgusted with their state leadership. all the signs of change are there. just wait and watch.''''

6,PMC protests secrecy in contracts scam,"pune: there was high drama in the pune municipal corporationâ€™s (pmc) general body meeting on wednesday when corporators cutting across party lines accused the civic administration of shielding top civic officers who had assisted three contractors in cheating the pmc by submitting fake bills. annoyed by these allegations, additional municipal commissioner d s zagade walked out from the meeting in a huff, claiming that the corporators were not giving him a chance to present the administrationâ€™s side of the story. zagadeâ€™s walk-out was seen by the corporators as a vindication of their stand that the civic administration was trying to push things under the carpet. curiously, the administration has turned down the corporatorsâ€™ request to name the six civic employees found guilty of participating in the scam, though the commissioner had suspended them two days ago. ncp corporator rajlaxmi bhosale pointed out that last year the administration had tabled a report before the general body naming the pmc school board members who were prima facie held guilty in the rs 96 lakh book purchase deal. â€œyou have registered a police complaint against the contractors and you have suspended the six civic officials, and yet you are not tabling a report about the case,â€� bhosale said. zagade replied that the administration was willing to submit the preliminary inquiry report immediately, but a detailed report would be ready after a thorough investigation which is expected to be complete in a fortnight. this agitated the corporators even further and they sought to know why the six employees were sacked in such haste if the investigations were still on. corporators bhagwan kshirsagar, ankush kakde, ujjwal keskar and ramesh bodke charged that they have heard reports that the fake documents were signed by senior civic officers, and that junior officers were being made scapegoats. kshirsagar said that the six employees who have been suspended had complained that their senior officers are indulging in malpractices. zagadeâ€™s assurance that the administration would not spare senior officers failed to satisfy the corporators. led by mla chandrakant chhajed, they demanded that he announce the names of the officers who had cleared the bills. it was at this juncture that zagade declared his intention to walk out. corporator ramesh bodke threatened to move resolution demanding the state government recall zagade. it was at this juncture that avandhal intervened and assured the house that a detailed report on the case would be tabled at the general body meeting to be held on thursday.

7,Banks’ indifference worries state govt,"patna: the meeting of bankers called by the chief minister in patna on wednesday is being held under the shadow of dropping credit-deposit (cd) ratio and a total indifference of commercial banks towards implementation of central and state-sponsored welfare schemes. â€œwe have been asking the rbi to change the lead banks and the top brass of various banks to take action against bankers failing to meet the target. but so far there has been no response,â€� said an official of the institutional finance department. on september 30, 2001 the total deposit of banks stood at about rs 30,000 crore while the credits were just rs 6,213 crore making the cd ratio of the state touch an all time low of 21 per cent. â€œthere are south indian banks like corporation bank, indian bank and andhra bank having a cd ratio of 5, 6 and 10 per cent respectively. financing is virtually not a part of their business. they collect money here and send it to their head officesâ€�, he said. the prime ministerâ€™s rojgar yojna (pmry), aimed at creating self-employment for the educated youths by providing them with loans up to rs one lakh has been given a short circuit by banks. during 2000-01, the target was 14,549. only about rs 50 crore were distributed among 6,174 applicants despite the fact that the state had forwarded 17,000 petitions. during 2001-02 the target given was 18,000. till december 2001, only rs 6.24 crore was distributed among the beneficiaries with over 400 commercial bank branches in the state showing nil performance. â€œeven if the target of 18,000 were met with rs one lakh to each applicant banks should have given bihar youths rs 180 croreâ€�, a state government official pointed. the ambitious rs 2,884 million shallow tubewell scheme given to bihar under the special economic package is also in the limbo due to banks reluctance to entertain petitions. the scheme is aimed at installing 10 lakh tubewells for irrigating 20 lakh hectares of land. the scheme consists of 20 per cent self finance, 30 per cent subsidy and 50 per cent loan for the beneficiaries. till december 2001, against the target of 34,000 shallow tubewells, the banks were able to finance only 1,000 tubewells. the performance in swaran jayanti rojgar yojna, a micro-credit scheme for the below poverty line population was equally disastrous. the target for formation of 35,000 self-help groups is lagging far behind with not even 1,000 groups being formed. the banks were supposed to give 15 lakh kisan credit card to farmers of bihar. housing subsidy scheme aimed at constructing 20 lakh houses for people having an income of at least rs 32,000 per year, has virtually failed to take-off with only 100 houses completed in the year 2001-2002. bankers in the past have complained about poor recovery rates. during 2000-01, the recovery rate of sbi was 31 per cent and pnb 69 per cent. the average recovery of regional banks was 52 per cent. â€œin july 2000, the institutional finance department had issued a circular to dms, and commissioners of the state to follow up recovery of loans up to rs 50,000 at the co level, from rs 50,000 to rs one lakh at sdo level and above rs 1 lakh at the level of dms in co-ordination with bankers. the bankers never availed of the facilityâ€�, said an official.

9,State’s development far below its potential: experts,"lucknow: despite occupying a central place in the countryâ€™s politics and positioned to take lead as a software superpower, uttar pradeshâ€™s post-liberalisation economic scene is in a dismal shape. the reason: rampant corruption, population explosion, failure of government machinery to percolate benefits to the grass roots and the political misgovernance has pushed up into the economic mess. and now the only way out seems to be to prepare a fresh plan of social empowerment, which is actually implemented to help people reap benefits on their own. this was in a nutshell what economists and academicians from all over the country concluded at a seminar on â€˜economic reforms in uttar pradesh: functional realities, issues and future agendaâ€™ organised by the institute of development studies, lucknow university, on wednesday. presenting the theme paper of the seminar, ids director prof ak sengupta along with dr ap tewari and sp mishra pointed out that now population should be the bench mark for economic policies. prof sengupta said that without focusing on education, health and social empowerment the state could not expect to perform well merely by privatisation or economic reforms. â€œbecause, in the absence of social empowerment, the benefits will be grabbed by the rich and affluent, leaving virtually nothing for the poor.â€� he pointed out to the members of the second state finance commission present on the occasion that despite having its own data the government had hired foreign agencies to collect data for the national family health survey. as many as 50 recommendations were made. these included: â€˜district budgetingâ€™ be introduced in the process of decentralisation, expenditure on education be 6 per cent of the sdp, focus on development of agro-based industry, income security to people and tax reforms, including agriculture income tax. prominent speakers on the occasion included former additional director dr sr rastogi of the population resource centre, prof op bohra from the national institute of public finance and policy, principal secretary finance vk mittal, principal secretary planning sn jha, prof rk sen from vishwa bharti, kolkata, prof nk taneja and prof smriti mukherji from gokhale institute of politics and economics, pune.

10,Political will helps development: Study,"lucknow: why is it that a constituency represented by the prime minister or any prominent politician shows an impressive growth rate while other constituencies lag behind? reason: a matter of political will. a study conducted under ap tewari, faculty member, institute of development studies, in and around amethi, sultanpur and jagdishpur highlighted that these areas showed a remarkable growth rate till the time they were represented by an influential politician. later, the growth rate slid down gradually. clearly, the government machinery as well as politicians were active when the constituencies had a strong representative eager for development. but, the situation was back to square one after they were gone. the case is same in other parts of the state. tewari said the government would have to investigate development vis-a-vis district, block and village disparities prevailing in the state. this would help in determining other factors also as why some areas are underdeveloped whereas adjoining areas show remarkable growth. once this was done, a resource base of the area should be identified and a decentralised planning should be introduced for creation of social and individual capabilities, he said. a suggestion in this regard would be to implement pilot projects in blocks and study their performance, he added.

11,Breaking the law and getting away with it,"lucknow: for dp yadav and his clan, breaking law seems to come as easily as getting away with it. little wonder then the gaziabad police were yet to rope in dpâ€™s son vikas alias vicky and nephew vishal in connection with the kidnapping of nitish mohan katara, son of a joint secretary rank officer in the union government, despite evidence against them. reason? yadavs enjoy a strong political clout in the state with the powers that be, cutting across party lines. when chief minister rajnath singh went to campaign for mahendra singh yadav, sitting bjp mla from bulandshahar, dp yadav shared the dais with them. recently, when the name of dp yadavâ€™s nephew figured in a murder case in baghpat, some top leaders of the ruling bjp coalition intervened to give the accused a clean chit and when the then superintendent of police (sp) objected to the move, he was conveniently shifted. the case was now being investigated by the cb-cid. apart from his involvement in jessica lal murder case, in early 90s vikasâ€™s name figured in the murder of a youth in kavi nagar locality of ghaziabad. son of an engineer, the victim had objected to vikas passing a remark at his sister and paid with his life. as dp yadav was then in the state cabinet headed by samajwadi party (sp) supremo mulayam singh yadav, vikas remained â€˜beyondâ€™ the reach of the police. the fir in this connection was lodged with the kavi nagar police but only after vikasâ€™s name was deleted from the crime by the police. and finally when some senior police officials put their foot down and arrested vikas, he was released on bail for lack of evidence. vikas and vishal were accused of kidnapping nitish mohan katara from kavi nagar area in ghaziabad around mid-night on saturday. sources said that nitish was a â€œfriendâ€� of dp yadavâ€™s daughter bharti. the two were together in the imt in ghaziabad. even after they passed out in 2000, they remained in touch. the two families, except dp yadav, were aware of the â€œfriendshipâ€� between the two, sources said. on saturday nitish went to attend the marriage of his imt batchmate in kavi nagar and bharti was also there. eye-witnesses confirmed that around mid-night nitish left with vikas and vishal. investigations carried out so far reveal that nitish was taken to the government accommodation of dp yadav in delhi and left the house in the morning with vikas. meanwhile, dp yadav lambasted the samajwadi party for falsely implicating his son vikas yadav in the kidnapping case. addressing mediapersons he said that rpd had put up an exceptionally good show during the first phase of assembly polls leaving the sp high and dry. terming the entire kidnapping incident as an election stunt he said that he would meet cm on thursday and seek an independent inquiry.

16,"Notice to ministry, govt on medical boards","new delhi: the delhi high court has issued notice to the union health ministry and city government on a petition seeking direction to the government to open medical boards at each hospital and make them accessible to persons with the disabilities so they can avail special facilities. a division bench comprising chief justice s b sinha and justice a k sikri directed the respondents to file their replies by april 30. the public interest litigation, filed by a lawyers group, social jurist, alleged lakhs of the disabled persons living in the capital were deprived of benefits of the latest medical laws as there are very few medical boards and these too are not easily accessible to them. during a brief submission on thursday, petitionerâ€™s lawyers ashok agarwal and ritu jain told the court that even when the disabled persons manage to reach the hospital where such a board is located, they are given a future date of one year and return without the certificate. â€˜â€˜giving long dates actually amounts to denial of special facilities that should be made available to them under the amended laws. the government should also be directed to publicise the location of these boards so that needy persons could help themselves,â€™â€™ agarwal told the bench. he said government was duty bound to create medical boards for issuance of disability certificates under persons with disabilities (equal opportunities and protection of rights and full participation) act of 1995; the national trust for the welfare of persons with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities act of 1999 and the un convention of rights of the child of 1989. â€˜â€˜even after years of framing the law, the government is yet to take action,â€™â€™ agarwal said. â€˜â€˜the respondents should give publicity to these boards through radio, television, notice boards and at the gates of various medical authorities to enable the persons with disabilities to conveniently approach them for obtaining disability certificates,â€™â€™ agarwal said.

17,Rlys change rules of catering service,"new delhi: the good old roti-subzi and idli-vada business on passenger trains seems to be greater moneyspinner for the railways than e-age optic fibre cables. the fledgling indian railway catering and tourism corporation (irctc) is set to earn rs 32 crore in the next few months whereas the railwaysâ€™ telecom corporation sunk several crores with no earning yet to show for it. added to the revenue is the corporationâ€™s assurance of healthy food. it has asked its contractors to seek iso 9001 and certificates based on hazard and accident control checkpoints. also, the railway catering contractors from now on will have to submit themselves to a new â€˜â€˜food auditâ€™â€™ by external agencies. as for the revenue, the irctc merely changed the rules of the old game. almost 85 per cent of railwaysâ€™ mobile catering business is contracted out. in the old system, the contractor would give 12 per cent of his turnover as license fee to the railways. that is, the contractor will have to give a turnover figure which railway officials will verify, leaving some scope for manipulation. the new corporation has worked out a formula to identify the catering potential of each train, looking into the trainâ€™s running time and number of meals, thus arriving at a licence fee. earlier, the choice of contractor had nothing to do with him offering a better price than others. whoever bagged the contract would pay 12 per cent for normal rail pantries and 15 per cent for the rajdhanis and shatabdis. now, the fixed licence fee is many times the earlier amount and then there is a one-time payment of call concession money. yet, there is no dearth of bidders, says mn chopra, the managing director of irctc.

20,Marandi govt mum on NIT move,"jamshedpur: bihar ""missed"" an iit. and jharkhand could lose a national institute of technology or nit, thanks to its science and technology minister samresh singh. the minister has been dragging his feet on the centre''s proposal to upgrade the regional institute of technology (rit) at adityapur into an nit. the state government has failed to act upon the union hrd ministry''s advice to amend the memorandum of association and rules to convert rit into a deemed university. ""the hrd ministry had sent the letter in september last year,"" says vicepresident, rit teachers'' association, a k choubey. ""the government has taken no step so far. it wants to open more engineering colleges in the state, but is not interested in availing this golden opportunity. over 5,000 students could study at rit once it is converted into an nit."" but singh has turned a blind eye to the agitation by the teachers, paralysing the state-run institute. ""we have sent several memoranda to the minister. but he has not responded even once,"" rues the association''s general secretary, sanjay kumar. the ""politicians and the college administration"", apparently, do not want to lose their ""golden goose"" which the institute has become. the institute, in the last couple of years, has been making the headlines for a host of scandals, ranging from admission to purchase and construction that are being investigated by cbi and the state vigilance department. ""the politicians and the bureaucrats would lose control over the college once it is granted nit status."" though the rit''s acting principal j p singh was not available for comments, the college authorities have claimed the formalities for converting the college into an nit cannot be completed in absence of the board of governors. the board has become dysfunctional following the bifurcation of bihar and jharkhand. however, the teachers'' association dubs the plea of the authorities as an excuse. ""the authorities don''t have problem in awarding contracts and making fresh appointments. the chairman has even amended the reservation policy, without bothering about the board.""

21,BJP wary of bidding for govt in UP,"new delhi: the samajwadi party and the bahujan samaj party are determined to put their best foot forward to lead the next government in uttar pradesh. the bjp, on the other hand, is divided on whether it should even make a bid at all for forming the government. this is because the bjpâ€™s internal assessment is that it will be nowhere near securing a majority on its own and will, therefore, require the support of another major party â€” the bsp being the obvious choice. while one section feels another unstable five years will see the bjp decimated, the other feels a non-bjp government in lucknow will adversely affect the nda government at the centre. the final exit poll results confirm a hung assembly in up, but vary so widely that no conclusions can be drawn till the actual results come in: dd has been the most generous with the samajwadi party, giving it 156 seats, while assigning 118 to the bjp and its allies, 36 to the congress and 13 to others. the zee poll, too, puts the sp ahead with 145 seats, the bjp and its allies second with 131, the bsp 84, the congress 24 and others, 19. aaj tak has the bjp and its allies pegged at 142, the sp at 36, the bsp at 83, the congress at 22, and 20 to others. if the bjp gets the backing of the bsp and the sp that of the congress and kalyan singhâ€™s rkp, then both stand an even chance of forming the government if dd is right. but by the same logic, the other two polls give the bjp an edge over the sp in forming a government in up. but most bjp mps from up â€” as well as party president k jana krishnamurthy â€” feel that if the bjp cannot â€˜â€˜honourablyâ€™â€™ form a government in lucknow, it should accept the peopleâ€™s verdict and sit in the opposition for five years. says a senior bjp leader, â€˜â€˜look at madhya pradesh and rajasthan â€” we lost the last assembly elections there but within a year, we had recovered enough to win a majority of the seats in the lok sabha polls there. if we form a government either through jor-tor or by backing mayawati, in five years, we will be wiped out.â€™â€™ if that is the organisational point of view, a bjp national executive member â€” reflecting the view from raisina hill, says: â€˜â€˜ we cannot afford a â€˜hostileâ€™ government in lucknow (ie, one led by mulayam singh yadav, supported by the congress and the rkp). it would have a negative impact on the nda coalition here.â€™â€™ with the leadership aware that chief minister rajnath singh will do his utmost to prevent mayawati succeeding him, bjp sources say a compromise is being attempted â€” central cabinet berths for mayawati and another bsp colleague and allowing her to choose a bjp cm. the names of lalji tandon, mayawatiâ€™s rakhi bhai, and up chief kalraj mishra are doing the rounds.
