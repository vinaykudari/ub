0,State committee to redefine govt. 'aid',"PUNE: Are unaided medical and dental colleges in the state truly unaided?

While a sizeable number of private medical institutions in the state have increased their fees substantially after a supreme court order â€” on the plea that they donâ€™t take favours from the government â€” the state government has constituted a high-level committee to determine their status and classify them as aided, partially aided or unaided.

The committee, under the chairmanship of W.B. Tayade, joint director of medical education and research, has been asked to submit its report by April 15. Other members on the committee are cost accountant D.V. Patwardhan, deputy secretary A.N. Naiknavare, additional secretary (law) Dattatray Parkhe, and additional secretary (medical education and drugs department) B.R. Gavit.

Official sources said the committee was formed after a court ruling in 2003 to find out how many private medical and dental colleges were availing concessions from the government.

The stateâ€™s ministers for health and technical education had earlier said private colleges have at some point of time taken favours from the government, either in the form of land or other aid.

While the committee will scrutinise documents already submitted by the private colleges before making a final judgement and classification, the officials pointed out that the relevance of determining the aid provided by the government, as it has a substantial bearing on the fee structure of medical education.

The committee members will hear from all the managements of institutions that have filed the information as directed by the Bombay high court, besides examining the legal provisions of individual cases.

The Studentsâ€™ Federation of India (SFI) had earlier suggested that the state government exercise total control over all private engineering and medical colleges. Disclaiming the rationale given by private educational institutions that they could fix their own fee structures in the wake of the supreme court order, SFI secretary Maharudra Dake had said that private colleges have taken some favour or the other from the government, and hence cannot be termed as unaided colleges.

1,Anti-incumbency factor and Kalyan Singh,"KANPUR: Samajwadi Partyâ€™s favourite mantra â€˜BSPâ€™ â€” bijli (power), sarak (road) and paani (water) â€” is a hit in this part of the world.

Reason: None of the three are visible in ravine-dominated villages of Billhaur Lok Sabha constituency.

Lacklustre performance of politicians have left voters sulking.

In such a scenario, caste lines would decide outcome of the elections and not the issue of development.

Behmai massacre is still a major political issue in the constituency.

Even after the murder of bandit queen-turned-politician Phoolan Devi, the 23-year-old massacre remains a major poll issue.

As such, Samajwadi Party nominee Lal Singh Tomar is trying hard to stem growing tide against him.

Reason: Thakurs are yet to forgive chief minister Mulayam Sinh Yadav for his favours to Phoolan Devi. In his bid to woo Thakurs, Tomar has been going around highlighting woes of Pota accused Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh instead of SP-led governmentâ€™s achievements.

On the other hand, Bahujan Samaj Partyâ€™s Raja Ram Pal is leaving no stone upturned to ensure that Thakurs never forget Phoolan who became an MP due to Mulayamâ€™s assistance.

As campaigning was becoming Thakur centric, senior SP leader Chaudhary Harmohan Singh intervened and told Tomar â€œThakurai sae kaam na chalihae, workers par dhyan do (Thakur centric campaign would do no good, concentrate on workers)â€�.

While BSP and SP nominees are banking on Thakur votes, four-time MP and Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Shyam Bihari Mishra and Congress candidate Madan Mohan Shukla are eying Brahmin voters. Congress decision to field a Brahmin candidate has come as a blow to Mishraâ€™s prospects as the latter is already facing anti-incumbency wave.

Caste equations indicate a four-cornered fight on May 5 with BSP candidate being the front runner. Among approximately 13 lakh voters, scheduled castes account for 25 per cent while Thakur and Brahmin voters are placed at around 15 per cent each. Besides, there is a sizable presence of Yadav and Lodh voters.

Though Mishra has sailed through on the last four occasions, his nearest rival Pal has narrowed the margin of defeats in the last two general elections. In 1998, Mishra polled 2,80,318 votes to defeat Pal by 91,347. In 1999, Mishra polled 1,92,054 votes while Pal bagged 1,88,831 thus bringing down the margin to merely 3,223 votes.

Being a scheduled caste, the traditional BSP voters â€” dalitsâ€” would polarise in his favour. The only solace for BJP candidate is the under-construction golden quadrangle road which passes through the constituency. Besides, re-entry of former chief minister Kalyan Singh in BJP is likely to tilt Lodh voters in favour of Mishra thus reducing the anti-incumbency heat. Fate of Congress candidate would depend on its traditional voters (Brahmins) as party cadres are expecting a boom after Rahul Gandhiâ€™s debut into politics.

Tomar, meanwhile, is banking on Thakur leaders like Raghuraj Pratap Singh and Amar Singh to make a difference.

2,Pachauri is fast losing friends in party,"KANPUR: Problems of Bharatiya Janata Party candidate from city seat Satyadeo Pachauri are compounding with every passing day.

As if internal bickering was not enough, the number of party leaders keeping away from the campaign too is steadily on the rise.

All this has brought broad smiles on faces of Congress and Samajwadi Party candidates. They are already one up on the saffron party in campaigning. After former MP Jagatveer Singh Dron and Cantonment MLA Satish Mahana, on Saturday partyâ€™s district chief Rakesh Sonkar too expressed discontent over the election coordination committee constituted by Pachauri.

The district president and three-time legislator was stunned by the exclusion of several senior leaders from the committee. â€œLeaders close to candidate has been preferred over senior and responsible party workers,â€� he told TNN. Regarded as a close ally of Mahana, the district president has other worries too. Not only Mahana but even Sonkar group has been sidelined.

However, he is not ready to take it easy and warns to take upthe issue with senior party leaders.

While Pachauri is going out of his way to describe the committee as fair decision, not many party workers are willing to follow instructions of coordination committee. While Diwakar Mishra would coordinate campaigning in Generalganj assembly, Kaushal Kishore Dixit would look after Govind Ngar and Anand Trivedi after Arya Nagar. Besides, Ram Gopal Jaiswal and Prahlad Singh have been appointed coordinators for Cantt and Arya Nagar assembly seat respectively.

Shortly after the announcement of coordination committee Cantt MLA Satish Mahana held a meeting in Rail Bazaar where workers unanimously decided not to take instructions from Jaiswal.

An annoyed Mahana told TNN: â€œWhy to take instructions from loyalists when we have senior and more capable leaders.â€� Party workers from Cantonment demanded that like previous elections Vishnu Prakash Mishra be appointed coordinator. Meanwhile, three-time MP Jagatveer Singh Dron has continuously kept away from all party functions.

Before the announcement of party candidate from city seat, Dron had told TNN: â€œI am a loyal party worker and if not given an opportunity to contest elections I will serve partyâ€™s cause.â€�

3,BJP is desperate to win polls: LJP,"PATNA: LJP has condemned what it described as ""BJP attack"" on the RJD office here on Saturday in which one person was killed and others were injured. LJP said BJP is desperate to win the ensuing Lok Sabha polls and hence unleashed criminals.

LJP general secretary and spokesman Mohammad Qamar Alam said opinion and exit polls should have been banned earlier as these influence voters'' minds. Such polls run counter to the concept of fair play in democracy and put their own spin on the ground situation. These polls by their very nature are sheer propaganda by bigger parties through surrogate means. Smaller parties cannot afford to have such polls.

The EC, which has got a clear mandate to ensure free and fair elections, does not require any ordinance to ban such tendentious polls, he added in a press release.He decried the attorney general''s argument in favour of such polls.

4,No change in BITS admission policy,"HYDERABAD: It''s confirmed. Admissions into the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani will be made based on marks at the +2 level.

BITS is a favourite institute among AP students and last year the highest number of students who went to BITS - more than 500 by a conservative count - were from the state.

Recently, Rajasthan High Court gave BITS the nod to continue with its old recruitment procedures for professional courses.

Hence, the institute will neither conduct a separate entrance examination nor will it recruit students who qualify for the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE), sources in BITS told The Times of India over the phone.

""The high court was categorical that the admission guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for professional programmes in 2004-05 would not be applicable to BITS.""

""The court restrained UGC from enforcing its instructions to bring BITS within the ambit of the AIEEE-2004 and also for subsequent years. The old admission process will not be interfered with,"" the sources said.

Since applicants for the institutes come from all over the country, the college has a unique normalisation process to figure out the ""relative displacement of a candidate"" who stood first in a public examination in his/her home state.

The equation is: If a first ranker of some board gets 94 per cent, it will be construed as 100 per cent aggregate in BITS. If a student of the same board gets 88 per cent, the normalised percentage will be (88x100)/94=93.61 per cent.

The cut off percentage for the 2004-05 academic year will be decided after the deadline for receiving applications. In the last two years, it was above 96 per cent, the sources said.

5,"Life's a dance, say hell to polls","HYDERABAD: Ashok Reddy, 24, is a hardcore pub-goer. He loves his drink and music. He''s successful and upwardly mobile and completely out of sync with the poll theatre that''s being played out there.

One evening, caught pubbing at his usual joint, he shrugs, shakes his head and looks quizzical. ""Polls? Who cares? Don''t know when Hyderabad''s voting.""

Reddy isn''t a freak. He''s one in the young crowd for whom politics means nothing. Political parties and their ideologies are alien. Their indifference to the election process is stunning.

In a state where more than 50 per cent of the total population is made up of young people, this aloofness is worrying for politicians. These young lives are obsessed with question banks, IIT, IIM and Eamcet scores. They study hard and, when the goal is reached, party hard.

""They are more engaged with Newton''s laws than the future law-makers,"" says political science lecturer K Srinivasa Murthy.

""That part of their lives when they should be looking around is given to cramming, attending tutorials, sitting through lecture sessions. The other aspects of life just go by unexplored.""

For instance, many among them don''t even know the name of their constituency. K Vijnan Kumar is a case in point. He lives in Trimulgherry. Ask him which his Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies are, he''s clueless. ""How are they relevant,"" he asks.

""This indifference is indeed disturbing,"" B Phaneesh Murthy, a sociologist working for an NGO, says. ""We are creating a breed of passport Indians, who''d put up with anything as long as their own goals are reached. The place where they live might be stinking. But who cares? The ultimate aim is to get to the US or an IIM degree.""

Soon enough, the nation would be led by geriatrics. There''d come a time when a 50-year-old minister will be considered young. The young world is far too disengaged.

This is possibly a consequence of banning elections in universities, says educationist Ch Ramaiah.

""It''s a situation where the young person''s links with history have been snapped. His culture and background are immaterial. The old social moorings are gone. A successful career is the only mantra,"" he explains.

6,Sanjay Paswan hurt in pre-poll violence in Bihar,"PATNA: In stepped-up pre-poll violence, three RJD activists were killed and ten others injured, as Union Minister of state for Human Resource Development Sanjay Paswan escaped with head and rib injuries in separate incidents at Jamui, Nawada and here, the police said.
