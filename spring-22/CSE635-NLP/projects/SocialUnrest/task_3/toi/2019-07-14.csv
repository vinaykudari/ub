0,AU students protest reduction in reserved seats,"LUCKNOW: The student members of the Ambedkar University Dalit Studentsâ€™ Union are on a fast unto death from July 10, to protest the move of the administration of the Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University to reduce the 50 per cent reservation of seats provided for dalit students, in the university.

The union leaders claimed that the first ordinance of the university included the provision for 50 per cent reservation of seats for dalit students in the university, which was later even approved by the University Grants Commission and the Government of India.

The leaders alleged that the acting Vice-Chancellor and the acting registrar, had hatched a conspiracy to reduce the reservation of seats for dalit students and had taken the matter to court. They informed that the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, in its interim order, directed the university authorities â€œto act in accordance with the lawâ€�.

The union leaders said that as the law in this case pertains to the first ordinance of the university, therefore the university administration should have followed the directions of the high court and issued a fresh order in consonance with its interim order. â€œSince all our pleas have fallen on deaf ears, we do not have any other option but to assert our democratic right and therefore we are sitting on this fast unto death,â€� said Dilip Kumar Jauhar, member of the executive committee of the union.

1,Education: Parents fee(l) the govt pinch,"MUMBAI: Arundhati Chavan is your average Mumbaikar. She teaches at Anjuman Islam polytechnic institute in the Fort area, finds time to help out at a special school and is proud to be a member of the Parent Teachersâ€™ Association of her daughterâ€™s school, Mahimâ€™s Canossa Convent.

Ms Chavan doesnâ€™t seem the kind to take on politicians and organise rallies. But last week, she was in the forefront of an agitation that displayed the divide in the cityâ€™s schools and brought protesters onto the roads. In a bid to counter a government decision to raise fees in state-aided English-medium schools, more than 5,000 parents, teachers and students held up traffic for more than five hours, eventually forcing chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh to issue a face-saving statement about reviewing the increase.

The writing is on the wallâ€”citizens who suffer higher petrol rates and taxes quietly wonâ€™t express the same benevolence when it comes to their childrenâ€™s tuition fees.

Academicians are pondering just how the fee increase swelled into such an explosive issue. They say that the governmentâ€™s continued neglect of the education sector, coupled with its perilous financial position, has alienated parents and the school authorities.

The trouble began to simmer when the state government implemented the Fifth Pay Commission recommendations four years ago for its six lakh teachers. Teachersâ€™ salaries went up by more than 100 per cent, making the government consider the unpopular measure of hiking fees, says H.N. Pal, administrator of the Sir J.J. group of schools.

Under the revised fee structure, parents earning more than Rs 50,000 per year have to pay fees starting at Rs 100 a month. Before this, fees hadnâ€™t changed in the last 40 yearsâ€”a nominal amount of Rs 5 per month for boys, while girls received free education.

2,Congress accuses TDP of failing on election promises,"KHAMMAM: The Congress and the Telugu Desam Party TDP) traded charges and counter-charges against each other on promises made by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu during his visit to the Khammam district in the recent past.

While, Congress MLA T Jeevan Reddy listed out the chief ministerâ€™s promises which were reportedly not fulfilled by the district administration, TDP leader and roads and buildings minister T Nageswara Rao at a separate press conference, said that the Congress was â€œtrying to gain political mileage by making a mountain out of a mole hill.â€�

According to Jeevan Reddy, Naidu has been making promises but the same were not being kept by the district administration. He said the Pandurangapuram bridge in Paloncha, Nagaram-Yanambialu, Yenkuru-Tanamcharla, Narsimhulugudem lift irrigation schemes, Paleru, Kamepalli, Bhadrachalam central water schemes were among the promises made by the chief minister and were not pursued by the district administration.

He alleged that Chandrababu was indulging in political gimmicks and the reality was much different from what he actually announced. Congress MLAs Yunus Sultan, R Venkat Reddy and DCC president Vanam Vekateswar Rao were present.

But the minister, while denying the allegations the Congress, claimed that the government had fulfilled 80 per cent of the 119 promises made by the chief minister and works on another per cent were in progress. He further said that Naidu visited the district as many as times to know the peoples problems.

The pending works were due to certain administrative problems, he said adding that the government was determined to complete them with in the stipulated time. The Congress is unnecessarily politicising the developmental process in the state only to malign the image the chief minister who was striving hard for the progress of the state, the minister added.

4,"Auto driver arrested, property recovered","VIJAYAWADA: The city crime police on Saturday arrested an auto driver B Laxmaiah, hailing from Bhatlaveedu village of Guntur district and recovered stolen property worth Rs 1 lakh from him.

Assistant commissioner of police (crimes) K Bhupal Singh, told reporters that one Abhay Singh of the city engaged an auto to go to the railway station along with his family on June 1.

5,PW’s peaceful bandh baffles state police,"WARANGAL: The 48-hour peaceful bandh called by the Peopleâ€™s War (PW) naxalite outfit in the state, has stirred a debate among the police and the intelligence agency.

While the intelligence wing is inclined to believe that the extremist outfit still wants the dialogue process with the government to be sustained, the police feel that it was a deliberate strategy by the PW to con them.

Particularly the bandh in Warangal and Karimnagar districts, the bastions of PW, passed off peacefully. However, the police feel that the naxalites, as a strategy, did not indulge in violence anticipating that the former would ease combing operations.

This opportunity, the outlawed group wanted to utilise to improve its network and step up its operations.

Observers of naxalite movement, including some politicians feel that the peaceful bandh was a welcome step but the mistrust between the police and the naxal outfit needed to be removed.

As a tactical move, according to a police official of Karimnagar district, the naxalites stayed away from violence only to project themselves as victims of police encounters. By this move the extremist outfit wanted to win over the rural masses, the official said.

Another reason for the lull could be the waning influence of naxalism in both these districts. Citing the figures of PW cadre strength from the documents recovered from the naxalites killed in encounters recently, the police sources feel the extremist outfit might have scaled down its operations only to fortify itself in the Telangana districts.

Meanwhile, the police are stepping up the security measures in the Telangana districts notwithstanding the dialogue process between the state government and the extremist group.

11,Sonia asks PM to review rehab of riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has written to Prime Minister Vajpayee, urging him to review the relief and rehabilitation of riot victims in Gujarat. In a letter on Saturday, she expressed her dissatisfaction with the work done so far and questioned the logic behind closing some of the relief camps. She has also called the compensation grossly inadequate.

""I am told that many camps have already been closed and there is pressure from the state government to wind up the remaining camps as well, even though the situation does not warrant their closure,"" Gandhi has said in the letter. ""I am receiving reports that the victims residing at the camps, most of whom are poor, still urgently need food rations, shelter during monsoons and fair compensation.""

According to her, the compensation paid so far is not only inadequate, but has also gone only to a small percentage of the victims. ""You are aware that many of the affected people have lost their sources of livelihood as well their homes. Adequate compensation and loans for reconstruction are therefore an urgent necessity.""

Gandhi complains that even some of the obvious measures, like proper sanitation, safe drinking water, medicines and education of children, have not been adequately provided by the state and Centre.

15,"ASI, NDMC clash over waterfall","NEW DELHI: A waterfall near a protected monument has become the point of contention between the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

While the NDMC is giving final touches to a cascading waterfall it has built at Darya Khan Lohaniâ€™s Tomb in East Kidwai Nagar, the ASI is planning to demolish it. According to the ASI, the waterfall has been built without their permission.

However defending the structureâ€™s construction, NDMC vice-chairman Ram Bhaj said: â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s an old plan which was prepared by the Union urban development ministry to beautify the tomb. When the ASI complained about it, we showed them all the relevant papers but they are still not satisfied.â€™â€™

A senior ASI official said: â€˜â€˜Despite issuing a show cause notice, the NDMC went ahead and built the waterfall. In fact it doesnâ€™t gel with the aesthetic appeal of the monument. We will demolish it.â€™â€™

He said the NDMC has to only maintain the area around the monument and not construct anything.

Meanwhile, unaware of the NDMC-ASI squabble, the local people are wondering how the waterfall will run? â€˜â€˜As it is we get low water pressure, which is hardly enough to meet our daily needs. Where will the water come for it,â€™â€™ said Mohini Sharma, a housewife who lives in C block.

Bhaj said, â€˜â€˜A separate tubewell will supply untreated water to run the fountain and the NDMC has enough funds for its upkeep.â€™â€™

The protected monument is the tomb of Dariya Khan who was chief justice during the reign of Bahlol Lodi (1451-1488) and a vakil in Sikandar Lodiâ€™s (1488-1518) time.

17,Development BJP’s poll issue in Himachal,"SHIMLA: Developmental works undertaken by the present government, liberal assistance from the Centre and corruption allegations against Congress leaders would be the BJPâ€™s main issues for the state assembly elections, due in March next, said BJP spokesman for Himachal Pradesh Ganesh Dutt.

He said chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal had already called upon party workers to place before the public facts and figures of developmental works completed in the last four years, which were possible only because of the liberal assistance from the Centre.

Dutt said it was for the masses to make up their mind whether they would side with the Congress whose leaders were tainted with allegations of corruption and nepotism or with the BJP that had not only fulfilled all promises made but had undertaken record developmental works despite tremendous financial constraints.

Claiming that the present BJP-led government had promoted all-round development of the state without a region, caste or creed bias, he accused the previous Congress governments of developing select regions and favouring certain people.

The party spokesman said the anti-employee steps by the Punjab government, where the Congress is in power, had exposed the partyâ€™s true agenda. The government there had put a freeze on DA and deprived employees of LTC facilities.

On the contrary, he said, under the Dhumal government there had been no strikes and any facility or demand that government employees had had been met immediately.

Dutt accused the previous Congress governments for the present financial malaise of the state, adding that when the present government came to power it inherited a debt of Rs 9,666 crore.

20,"PWP not to join DF govt, says Patil","PUNE:Warning the Vilasrao Deshmukh government not to take his party for granted, senior leader of the Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), Prof. N.D. Patil, on Sunday ruled out any possibility of re-joining the Democratic Front (DF) or the state cabinet.

Addressing a press conference at the end of a two-day party conclave here, Patil said the PWP had decided to maintain equi-distance from both the ruling democratic front and the BJP-Shiv Sena combine. In what might be crucial for state politics in days to come, Patil said the five MLAs belonging to PWP will not shy away from voting against the government in case any issue demands such an action. â€œThe party legislators will vote according to the merit of the issue without bothering about the consequences,â€� he said.

Patil said the PWP cannot be blamed for the political crisis in the state last month as the DF government was in majority even after the withdrawal of its support. â€œThe leaders of both, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had gone on record stating that the exit of the PWP from the DF combine was a setback, but will not affect the stability of the government,â€� he said.

Justifying the withdrawal of support to the government, Patil said the Congress and the NCP had become complacent about several important issues relating to farmers and development matters in general. Significantly, he said the two major partners in the ruling front never bothered to take his party into confidence while taking important policy decisions. â€œWe came to know about the increase in water surcharge, labour law amendments and the hike in rates of ration for the below poverty line (BPL) people through newspapers,â€� he said.

But the proverbial last straw on the camelâ€™s back was the unofficial alliance struck by the NCP with the Sena in the Raigadh zilla parishad polls. PWP not to join DF govt., says Patil.
