0,Animal lovers protest order,"BANGALORE: The order by Lok Ayukta N. Venkatachala to make Bangalore stray dog-free like Singapore has invited protests from animal rights activists.

CUPA trustee and Income Tax PRO Sudha Narayan said: ""We, animal lovers, agree that sick, rabid, biting dogs should be put to sleep. But putting all dogs to sleep would just not be ethical.

Poornima Harish of Animal Rights Fund said: ""We do not accept the Lok Ayukta order. We will challenge it. Things have improved after the Animal Birth Control programme. The number of deaths due to rabies and dog bite cases have come down substantially.""

2,Students rally against war on Iraq,"KOLKATA: Students brought out a huge rally in the city on Wednesday to protest against the US war threats against Iraq even as Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar urged the Centre to clearly denounce the US.

Otherwise, he said, the country would lose its high moral ground in the community of nations. Meanwhile, the state Assembly has decided to pass an all-party resolution condemning the â€œunjust war against Iraq violating the basic tenets of the UN Charterâ€�.

Expressing solidarity with the anti-war demonstrations across the globe, the resolution will call upon the countries opposing the â€œwar designs of Bush-Blairâ€� to assert themselves more and hold high the banner of peace.

The resolution is likely to be placed in the House on March 21. Addressing the national studentsâ€™ convention at Calcutta University, Sarkar said India had once led the Non-Aligned Movement and yet was failing to denounce the US war efforts now.

â€œI urge the Centre to keep the countryâ€™s high tradition of siding with the downtrodden and oppressed nations of the world rejecting the designs of the imperialist forces,â€� Sarkar said.

Speaking at the convention, organised by the Calcutta University Studentsâ€™ Union, Left Front chairman Biman Bose said that the US, if allowed to continue with its policy, would target countries like Iran, Syria, Egypt and Lebanon for oil.

4,'Focus on infrastructure development',"LUCKNOW: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Uttar Pradesh chapter, held its annual session at the Taj Residency on Wednesday.

Elections to office bearers was held, at the session, with Keshav Thirani, managing director, Autometers Alliance Ltd, Noida, continuing as the chairman, and Kiron Chopra, managing director, Chopra Retec Rubber Products Ltd, Lucknow, being elected the vice-chairman.

A session on ''Developing the competitive edge for industry: The road ahead'', was organised, in which, Keshav Thirani, chairman, CII UP state council spoke about the requirements of industrialists to meet new challenges thrown up by the emergence of globalisation. Both new and traditional forms of industries should adopt the latest technologies to remain at the forefront of competition, Thirani stressed.

The government too has to be receptive to ideas and focus on infrastructure development to create the optimum scenario for the industry to blast-off, he stated.

Dr Sheema Rizvi, minister for IT and electronics, UP â€” the chief guest â€” said the absence of a stable government over the past decade in Uttar Pradesh, has been the bane of industry in the state.

Tourism, small scale industries and IT are the keys to UP catching up with its southern counterparts, she said, and announced that the single window system for projects is about to be finalised.

Dr Pritam Singh, director, Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow, delivering the keynote address, dwelt on three aspects â€” context building, landscape of the Indian mindscape and the kind of road map required for this. Comparing the Indian and Chinese economies, he pointed out the glaring disparities on key parameters, despite the apparent similarities in the two.

He said India should think in terms of a global landscape, wealth creation, information and intellectual capital, outsourcing, and leading from the front as far as positive change was concerned.

Dr Upendra Kumar, MD, Uptech Computer Consultancy Ltd made a presentation titles ''Industry/ Business in Uttar Pradesh: Emerging challenges and opportunities'', pointing out that agro-based industries, process food industries, IT and IT-enabled services, and knowledge management services are the key areas for growth that UP should concentrate on.

SK Bijlani, chairman, CII (northern region) said direct changes are sweeping Asia and there is a radical restructuring across industries. The focus of second generation reforms, he said, has shifted from the Centre to the states.

5,Jabir pulls up junior minister,"PATNA: Bihar legislative council chairman Jabir Hussain on Wednesday reprimanded junior minister for health education Sheetal Ram for what he termed â€œsadan ko halke dhang se lena (taking the House lightly)â€�.

What invited the ire of the chairman was the ministerâ€™s failure to give a proper reply to a question regarding one Vishram Ojhaâ€™s appointment as a clerk in Sri Dhanwantari Rajkiya Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya at Buxar allegedly on the basis of a fake matriculation certificate. Earlier, Badri Narain Lal (CPI) raised the issue in the House through a call attention motion. The minister informed the House that the Ojhaâ€™s certificate of â€œMadhyamaâ€� examination, issued by Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit Vidyalaya, Darbhanga, has already been verified.

Charging the government with misleading the House, another member produced a document disputing the ministerâ€™s claim. Sensing the seriousness of the matter, Hussain remarked: â€œJalsajon ke bachao ke liye sarkar hai kya?â€� He asked the minister to name the officer who had prepared his reply. After the minister did so, Hussain remarked: â€œJis pracharya ne jalsaji kiya usi ka hawala de rahen hain. Bilkul aapne tamasha kar diya (You are quoting the same principal who is charged with committing the fraud).â€� Later, the chairman asked the minister to give a complete answer on the issue on March 25. Uproar over compensation: The House witnessed uproarious scene following the admission of panchayati raj minister Upendra Prasad Verma about the governmentâ€™s failure to make payment of compensation to the family of victims who were killed in a â€œfakeâ€� encounter at Manjhaul in Begusarai district. Chairman Jabir Hussain asked the minister to apprise him of the progress made in the files related with the incident.

â€œI shall personally see all the files related to this incident,â€� he announced. The issue will again come up in the House on March 25. Earlier, the minister attributed the delay in payment of compensation to the ongoing probe into the incident by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The issue was raised by Mahachandra Prasad Singh through a short notice question.

One Chandan Kumar reportedly received bullet injuries while more than one and a half dozen people were injured in the incident. Chandan has been admitted to a private nursing home located in Phulwarisharif area. Meanwhile, the district administration has deployed heavy forces in the area to keep the situation under control. The anti-riot vehicle â€œVajraâ€� has been parked near Tamtam Parao in the same area fearing trouble in the wake of prevailing tension between the two communities. Earlier, trouble began when a group of people, belonging to a particular community, started collecting â€œchandaâ€� (donations) from the truck drivers on the FCI road located close to their native place, Khalipura.

Meanwhile, truck drivers attacked them and beat up one of the youth. The injured youth is said to be one Hesamuddin. Some youths returned to Khalipura and informed other people about the incident.

7,Drug raids expose govt armour chinks,"PATNA: In a major operation against the sale of fake and substandard drugs, the state drug control administration of the health department on Wednesday raided the shops of 10 medicine wholesalers, including the Gandhi Agencies, Rajendra Medical Agencies, Sangam Traders, Drug India and Sarita Agencies, at Uday Place and Mahima Place on Govind Mitra Road here.

The raids, however, exposed the chinks in the armour of drug control administration. It proved to be quite ill-equipped to conduct such massive raids. They revealed existence of more than 40 medicine shops in the basement of Mahima Place. A majority of them did not even have a signboard.

Barring a few, the shops were closed at the time of raid. The drug control officials could seal only two of them. There are about 800 shops on the road, including about 250 located at Mahima Place. A large number of medicine dealers closed their shops as soon as they came to know about the raids. The raids were carried out by 33 drug inspectors and five regional licensing authority (RLA) personnel under the supervision of State Drug Controller Sangeet Kumar Sinha.

There are only 38 drug inspectors in Bihar. The drug control team reached the place at 12.30 pm in seven vehicles. The Patna district administration had deputed there an executive magistrate along with constables. Sinha said the raids have sent a right signal to medicine dealers who sell fake and substandard drugs, adding that several drugs being sold in contravention of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act were seized. Patna RLA Y K Jaiswal said a large number of physicianâ€™s samples were seized from Drug India. Sinha said he has asked the Sangam Drug House at Uday Place not to sell 137 drugs as the salespersons manning the shop at the time of raid failed to show the purchase receipts, adding that the officials seized three drugs in the shop.

He said 13 expired drugs lying in front of the shop of another medicine wholesaler, Associate Traders, at Uday Place were also seized. Medicine dealers are not supposed to keep such drugs even in front of their shops, he added. Sinha said the Gandhi Agencies has been asked not to sell four drugs. Samples of four drugs were collected from the shop for chemical tests. Maa Shakti Drugs, another medicine shop at Uday Place, was sealed as its owner failed to turn up before the officials conducting the raids, he maintained.

8,RJD rally to protest US hegemony,"PATNA: The RJD is going to organise a rally in protest against Americaâ€™s â€˜dadagiriâ€™ (bullying) and its proposed war against Iraq on Thursday. RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav will lead the rally.

The show appears to have been hijacked by Lalooâ€™s brother-in-law Subhash Yadav and his men. Already hoardings in Patna have been painted green hailing Subhash Yadav. â€œThe rally will be unique. Over two lakh persons are going to participate in it,â€� claimed Subhash Yadav.

The services of party strongmen, like Lalit Yadav and Azad Gandhi, have already been recruited to bring in the crowds. â€œAtleast 10,000 persons are likely to come from my constituency,â€� claimed Lalit Yadav. Azad Gandhi stated that the cut-outs and posters are in Hindi, Urdu and English. However, not all sections of the RJD are happy over the rally on Wednesday.

Subhash Yadavâ€™s brother, Sadhu Yadav, appears to have kept himself aloof from the rally. â€œWhatâ€™s all this fuss about holding a rally against the US when the state is facing acute problems with regard to,â€� said an RJD MLA fron Sadhuâ€™s camp.

9,Development of Trishul missile on backburner,"NEW DELHI: The short-range surface-to-air missile â€˜â€˜Trishulâ€™â€™, one of the five core missiles being developed under the countryâ€™s indigenous missile programme, seems to be as good as dead.

Defence minister George Fernandes admitted in Parliament that â€˜â€˜Trishulâ€™â€™ was being â€˜â€˜progressed (only) as a technology demonstrator, de-linking from the user servicesâ€™â€™. In other words, the armed forces have now been de-linked from the project. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) officials also admit the missile is now â€˜â€˜on the backburnerâ€™â€™.

The nine-km-range â€˜â€˜Trishulâ€™â€™ has been dogged by several delays due to repeated snags in guidance and propulsion technologies. The Navy, for instance, was compelled to go in for the Israeli â€˜â€˜Barakâ€™â€™ anti-missile systems for its warships due to repeated slippages in the â€˜â€˜Trishulâ€™â€™ programme.

â€˜â€˜While a number of complex technologies and sea-skimming capability have been established, the missile needs to be proved for all its capabilities. These technologies will be useful in futuristic missile projects,â€™â€™ said Fernandes. The defence minister, however, replied in the negative about whether sanctions imposed by the United States had led to the failure of the â€˜â€˜Trishulâ€™â€™ programme.

10,"Shiite Muslims, policemen injured in Pak violence","LAHORE: Two Shiite Muslims and a police officer were treated at a hospital after violence erupted at a religious gathering prior to the annual Shiite mourning of the death of one of their martyrs, officials said today.

The clash occurred near Bhalwal, 200 kilometres southwest of the eastern city of Lahore, when Sunni Muslim residents allegedly objected to the sermon of a Shiite cleric, police said.

The verbal exchange led to a scuffle, and later both sides threw stones and fired guns, officials said.

Bhalwal authorities said that by evening the situation was under control.

Pakistan this week put police on alert to prevent religiously motivated violence- particularly against minority Shiite Muslims- during the Islamic holy month of Muharram.

Muharram is the first month of the Islamic calendar and the mourning month for Shiites, when they recall the seventh-century death in battle of Hussein, grandson of Islam''s prophet Mohammed, on the plains of Karbala in modern Iraq.

The battle was part of a leadership dispute that arose after Mohammed''s death. It caused the split in Islam between Shiites and Sunnis, and remains a powerful source of inspiration for many Shiites.

The Bhalwal clash occurred during the lead-up to the observance Friday of Ashoura, the blackest day for Shiites, who make up about 10 per cent of the world''s estimated 1 billion Muslims.

13,Lawyers' stir draws flak as suicide threat fizzles out,"VADODARA: Chinks emerged in the lawyers'' unity on Thursday as one of the Baroda Bar Association (BBA) members, who had threatened to jump from the Nyay Mandir building, changed his decision, which did not go down well with the large gathering assembled there.

The BBA locked horns with the police recently over the issue of a case being registered against a senior lawyer for not parking his vehicle at the proper place. As lawyers stalled court proceedings on Thursday, it was harrowing time for litigants who had come from far off places.

A restless crowd had gathered around Nyay Mandir since morning in wake of the threat by the senior lawyer to jump off the court building in protest. While the police deployed forces in the court complex, the lawyer, RNS Ghotra, developed cold feet and decided not to carry on with his threat.

â€œRamani''s determination to carry on with his hunger strike despite his deteriorating health inspired me to take the decision to jump. But then, I realised that by doing so democracy stands defeated. If advocates are forced to resort to extreme steps like this, it will demoralise the common man,â€� Ghotra tried to justify his move, even as the crowd jeered and shouted.

However, undaunted by Ghotra''s volte face, the BBA has decided to intensify its agitation from Saturday. â€œWe will stage a ''rasta roko'' in the Old City area on Saturday and resort to mass-arrest if need be. But we will not stop our protest against the police commissioner,â€� BBA president Narendra Tiwari said, adding that the courts will remain closed as a mark of protest against the â€œhighhandednessâ€� of the city police.

Caught in the crossfire were litigants who came here from the district. â€œWe have come from Padra village to attend the hearing of our case, but weâ€™ll now have to go back.

We somehow managed to meet our lawyer and got the next date of hearing,â€� said one litigant Mahesh Jasbhai. Traders in the area expressed surprise on Thursday over Tiwari''s statement on their behalf that they would down shutters in support of lawyers. â€œWe are being unnecessarily dragged into the controversy. We haven''t pledged support to any body,â€� said a businessman in Kadak Bazaar area, not willing to be named.

Tiwari said, â€œThe police commissioner refused to attend a meeting called by the district collector and district judge on Wednesday to resolve the issue. The matter is now in the hands of the state home department.â€�

14,Meter rule in PCMC soon,"PUNE: In a significant move, the traffic mobility committee of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has decided to re-implement the â€˜pay-by-meterâ€™ rule for three-seater rickshaws.

The committee on Tuesday decided to hold an initial meeting with union leaders in an attempt to convince rickshaw drivers to use meters. Assistant police inspector (traffic) and a member of the committee Suhas Bhosale told TNN that this time, they would hold a one-to-one meeting with the drivers.

â€œAnd if they (rickshaw drivers) are not convinced and flout the rule, we will take strict action against them,â€� he said. It may be recalled that the traffic police have failed to implement the meter rule in the PCMC on three previous occasion.

Drivers had complained that meter rates were not affordable to them as they rarely got return passengers. The police initially enforced the rule strictly on all three occasions but could not keep up the momentum. The last time the police failed to implement the rule was two months ago.

â€œWe collected fines up to Rs 8 lakh from three-seater drivers and even confiscated some rickshaws. Those rickshaws are lying at regional transport authorityâ€™s premises,â€� Bhosale said, adding that despite this, the drivers refused to adhere to the meter rule.

Three-seater drivers in the PCMC have been long since found demanding exorbitant fares from commuters. And with the public transport system being weak, commuters have no alternative but to give up to their demands.

15,Cong raises issue of 'mass suicides',"GANDHINAGAR: The tragic mass suicide by a family of five in a Vadaj slum of Ahmedabad last week found mention in the state assembly on Thursday when Congress members alleged that mass suicides had increased, ever since BJP assumed power in the state, mainly due to poor economic conditions.

Raising the issue, senior Congress members Punjabhai Vansh and Chandrikaben Chudasma charged that the family had committed suicide because the father was unemployed and not in a position to make both ends meet. â€œThis was the eighth such incident and it was high time the government took a serious view of such incidents and implemented remedial measures to prevent such tragedies.â€�

Minister of state for home Amit Shah, however said the police was still investigating whether it was a case of mass suicide or accidental deaths. Shah said preliminary investigations had shown that Nagjibhai Makwana, head of the family, was mentally deranged.

Even his father was said to be suffering from metal illness and had committed suicide by jumping into the Sabarmati some years ago. Shah assured the House that government had taken a serious note of the incident and was trying to ascertain its cause. He ruled out the possibility of the extreme step being taken because of poverty as had been reported. He said the police had recovered a â€˜above poverty lineâ€™ ration card and 15 kg of foodgrain from the house of the victims in Purpiditnagar.

The mother and two of the children had petty jobs, he claimed. Dr Jitendra Patel, legislator from Sabarmati constituency and Ishverbhai Makwana who had rushed to the site of incident, supported the ministerâ€™s statement and demanded that the remaining members of the family be given financial aid.
