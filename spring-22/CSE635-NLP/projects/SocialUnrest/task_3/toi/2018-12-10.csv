0,Cong defectors stoke unrest in Trinamul camp,"kolkata: with mamata banerjee out of the union cabinet, trinamul congress leaders seem to be getting impatient. state-level leaders like paresh pal and sadhan pandey have openly expressed their dissatisfaction immediately after the party's organisational elections. but on a more serious note, the recent induction of at least seven erstwhile intuc leaders in trinamul state leadership has caused a few heart burns. senior intuc leader samar chakrabarty was not only inducted into the party, but also made its state vice-president. chakrabarty's induction has not been taken kindly by trinamul's ""own"" trade union leaders like sobhandeb chattopadhyay. though chakrabarty is a veteran trade unionist, he has never featured as a trinamul functionary. on the face of it, chattopadhyay is not peeved at the new induction. but it is clear that he is not ready to yield space for the veteran intuc leader. ""trinamul has fully endorsed our organisation and party leaders often join us for programmes organised by inttuc. ""it is important to see what chakrabarty and others are contributing to the trinamul trade union wing,"" said chattopadhyay, indicating that chakrabarty and his men may not be welcomed with open arms into the inttuc fold. six more intuc leaders have been accommodated in pradesh trinamul general body. trinamul sources point out that all these leaders were inducted into the party under pressure from intuc veteran and kolkata mayor subrata mukherjee. and none of the original trinamul trade union leaders have made it to the party's governing body. mukherjee and chakrabarty were dropped from the congress-backed intuc at its national convention in ranchi in early november. intuc sources said that congress leaders oscar fernandes and sudha joshi were instrumental in dropping them. mukherjee, however, is not at all perturbed. ""apart from samar chakrabarty, all others have been with the trinamul from the very beginning,"" he told tnn. ""i will be accused of being soft to the left when i launch a joint movement with them on january 7 over the plight of jute industry,"" mukherjee said. ""it is not right to weaken the trade union movement by dividing it on party lines,"" mukherjee added. but his erstwhile intuc colleagues are also a disillusioned lot. ""the trinamul will not touch us with a barge pole and the congress has revived its own labour cell,"" said one of them. but mukherjee seems to have kept the option open for the two congress groups to merge in some future date.

2,Naxalites torch Banjari cement factory trucks,"sasaram: in their second offensive against the kalayanpur banjari cement factory here within a fortnight, about 100 maoist communist centre (mcc) activists wearing police uniform on sunday morning set ablaze eleven trucks laden with cement near the tumba village under the extremist-affected rohtas police station of the rohtas district. three of the torched trucks belonged to the factory and one was owned by an rjd mla. the other trucks belonged to local transporters. the outlawed naxalite outfit had given a call to truckers not to provide their vehicles for transporting the factory cement a few days back. sources said the mcc had been pressurising the management for extortion money. the failure of the management of the loss-making unit to oblige them has annoyed the mcc. the armed mcc men also assaulted the drivers and cleaners of the trucks before torching the vehicles. the trucks were on way to the sonenagar railway station of the aurangabad district, where the cement was to be unloaded. after taking the drivers and the cleaners hostage, the mcc members set afire the trucks one by one. the disclosure of one of the drivers that his vehicle was owned by an rjd mla further infuriated the extremists and the driver was again assaulted badly. on getting information, senior district officials have rushed to the spot. sources said about a fortnight ago, the mcc extremists had set ablaze a truck laden with cement near the factory premises under the amjhore police station and kidnapped the driver and cleaner. a passerby was also killed in indiscriminate firing by the mcc men when he tried to escape in his maruti van. sunday's attack was the fifth naxalite attack in the last two months on the cement factory, the only industrial unit worth the name in the district. earlier, the mcc squad attacked the factory on two consecutive days for looting arms and ammunition belonging to the factory's security personnel. after the mcc had issued its threat to the transporters, the factory management had requested the state government authorities to provide adequate security to the lives and property of the employees and the unit. yet, the mcc managed to torch the vehicles on sunday. the mcc squad later escaped in the kaimur hills, infamous as a hideout of naxalites. the road wore a deserted look as vehicles went off the road after the incident which has also created a sense of acute insecurity among the employees of the factory. recurring incidents of naxalite violence against the factory have put a question mark over the future of the company and its employees. nearly 50,000 people of the district and adjoining areas are directly or indirectly dependent on the factory for their livelihood.

3,Move against absenteeism among govt doctors,"patna: union health minister c p thakur said on sunday that the centre has approved some stringent measures to ensure presence of doctors at primary health centres and medical college hospitals during working hours. delivering the convocation address at the eighth convocation of the national board of examination (nbe) in which about 1,200 medical graduates were awarded the degree of diplomate national board (dnb), thakur said any doctor found violating the provisions of the regulation on professional code of conduct and ethics would be strictly dealt with by the medical council of india. bihar governor v c pande was the chief guest at the function. thakur said the centre has made it mandatory for the doctors to maintain the clinical records of in-patients for a period of three years and pass them on to the patient concerned within 72 hours if required. it has also made it mandatory for the doctors to display their registration certificates at their clinics to help the government identify quacks, he added. referring to bio-medical research, he said the government has formulated comprehensive guidelines which would be mandatory for any institute conducting such research on human beings. any violation of these would mean a ban on the research body. the centre is planning to establish a central medical university, he maintained. thakur said the proposed national health policy of the centre will ensure that 55 per cent of the public sector spending on health is utilised to provide primary health care. although the government has been spending a huge amount on medical education, the benefit of specialised care is not reaching the common people, he felt. he asked nbe president r v azad to launch time-bound projects for development of protocol for clinical evaluation of new drugs. jammu and kashmir chief minister farooq abdullah said the doctors in his state are performing their duty despite threats from terrorists. while maintaining that the states lack resources to develop proper health infrastructure, abdullah urged the centre to release more funds to them. he said the government hospitals in j&k are inadequately funded and do not have sufficient staff. he urged the centre to provide better pay package to doctors. both thakur and abdullah were conferred the honorary degree of dnb on this occasion. azad said the nbe has created 620 seats in 39 specialities and super specialities by accrediting institutions in the private, public and corporate sectors. it has so far recognised 182 such institutions. the board is making efforts to meet the increased manpower requirement relating to surgical and other medical specialities to be made available to the people, he added. several top doctors of the country, including the director of the all india institute of medical sciences in delhi, attended the function.

4,A suicide and maths as the sum of all fears,"new delhi: how do we divide a fraction by a fraction? inverse the divider and multiply the two fractions. but why? area is length multiplied by breadth. but why? our teachers never told us why. and that is possibly why mathematics - the magic key to many opportunities - is something most students fear. so intimidating is the fear of numbers, that 16-year-old amit puniya committed suicide last month when he found mathematics impossible to handle. his was only the most extreme case. most remedial classes in schools are packed with students requiring that 'extra' help in mathematics and most who require tuitions do so in mathematics. more and more are seeking psychiatric help. ""seventy per cent of the 50-odd children i see every day are victims of academic pressure,"" says dr samir parikh, consultant psychiatrist. ""our teaching methodology is skewed. we insist that children must improve their concentration, but never tell them how. we tell them they must 'improve' in mathematics, but not how they can go about it,"" he says. according to jose paul, formerly with st xavier's school, who teaches teachers how to teach mathematics: ""after class 6, everyone makes a child conscious that his or her future is sealed if he or she doesn't make it in maths. this only drives the child away from the subject,"" he says. so why is there a mental block about mathematics? ""maths needs logical thinking and practice,"" says p k sharma, head of department, mathematics, springdales school, dhaula kuan and pusa road. ""teachers need to explain concepts rather than just the methods. but nobody has the time. teachers are caught up in extra-curricular activities and children have too many tuitions to attend,"" says sharma . agrees annie koshy, principal of st mary's school, safdarjang enclave. ""a bad teacher can kill initiative. also, with the indian social psyche equating intelligence with mathematics, a child is under immense pressure to perform. the result: he or she neglects other areas of talent,"" she says. that mathematics can become everyone's cup of tea if taught well and delhi public school, r k puram believes that it has managed to achieve this. says the school's education counsellor mamta sharma: ""students here are fairly comfortable with mathematics. in fact, many take it up for higher studies. here, the problem is social studies. that really bogs them down,"" she says. that clearly does not seem to be the case in most schools. invariably maths becomes a problem first because teachers fail in getting their message across and secondly when comparisons become too much to bear. success in maths becomes all important and those who have the aptitutde and do well enjoy an exalted status in classrooms. others who cannot keep up either stagnate or keep sliding. failure feeds on failure. when 16-year-old amit took his own life last month he had lived through these many agonies.

5,‘SP to continue terror law protest’,"kanpur: criticising the bjp-led union government for its plan to implement the much-hyped prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), the samajwadi party chief, mulayam singh yadav on sunday said the samajwadi party would continue its protest against poto both inside and outside the parliament, as the ruling party was planning to harass anti-bjp political parties in the name of poto. yadav said that in order to combat terrorism in the nation, it required a powerful armed force with hi-tech ammunition, instead of such ordinances. talking to reporters at the circuit house here, he said there was no requirement of any ordinance like poto in the nation, as tada and nsa already existed to counter anti-national activities. it was really a surprising fact, he said, that those political parties which had opposed implementation of tada, dir and mesa, were now advocating this ordinance which was really a cause of great concern. he charged that the bjp government was interested in implementing the ordinance to get political revenge with other political parties in the name of saving the nation from anti-national forces. he alleged that the police had arrested several samajwadi party workers under national security act (nsa) from various parts of india, but later the court had released all of them due to lack of evidence. it had vindicated the fact that the intention of the government was not clear behind the ordinances. reacting sharply on assurances of prime minister atal behari vajpayee to the vishwa hindu parishad's activists for solving the ram temple issue before march 12, he said the prime minister should inform the nation about the solution which he had assured vhp leaders. he alleged that the prime minister was supporting vhp leaders so that they could instigate the temple issue, especially in uttar pradesh, to make a favourable atmosphere for the bjp in the polls.

6,‘Common goal for development’,"nagunuru (karimnagar): union home minister lal krishna advani on sunday suggested that people set themselves a saamuhik lakshya (collective goal) for attaining comprehensive progress. addressing a gathering after inaugurating prathima institute of medical sciences in karimnagar on sunday, home minister said that only by setting a common goal can one achieve the desired progress. he said pre-independent india has got a common goal of realising independence and it was achieved with a collective effort. similarly, the present day society, too, requires similar effort for taking our country on the path of progress. he said, country was progressing in the right direction and indians have become torch bearers in medical and health fields. advani lauded chief minister n chandrababu naidu's efforts in taking andhra pradesh towards a definite goal and added that naidu changed complexion of the political scenario by making issues such as governance, administration and development as prime subjects on the electoral arena. naidu said inspiration of janmabhoomi was reaching nooks and corners of the state and called upon non-resident indians to lend a supportive role to the janmabhoomi cause. he lauded efforts of prabhakar rao guniganti,md of pims for donating rs 6 crore to the hospital. naidu said,andhra pradesh was achieving positive results in prevention of communicable and contagious diseases. he called on doctors and health institutes to educate people about prevention of diseases as surveys were revealing an alarming increase in heart diseases. he said, government was working hard to improve medicare by increasing the health budget from rs 550 crore to rs 1,500 crore. health was given top priority by the government in its agenda and each district is granted a medical college during the last two years. health minister n janardhan reddy suggested to the pims management to encourage satellite hospital system in rural parts. union minister of state for home ch vidyasagar rao suggested to the hospital management to provide medicare for poor. pims managing director prabhakar rao and others also addressed the gathering.

7,Govt sticks to terror law with changes,"new delhi: a senior union minister has said that the government intends to press the poto bill to its logical conclusions. ""we have heard the opposition and accepted a number of their valid suggestions, but now we are determined to go ahead and make it law even if it requires a joint session of parliament."" discussion on the contentious bill in parliament is slated for tuesday. the government's acceptance of the changes in the bill reflects its decision to obtain the widest possible consensus. however, the left and the congress remain steadfast in their opposition to the bill. according to government sources, ""they have no amendments to suggest since they are against the entire bill."" many of the changes made reflect the views of ncp chief sharad pawar and tdp supremo chandrababu naidu. the government has now accepted that the term of the bill will be three years and not five, a concession to naidu. it has deleted the entire section 8 which critics charged could be misused against journalists and political opponents of the government. the government officials acknowledge that the changes in the provisions relating to the confiscation of property used for terrorists were needed. earlier provisions accorded the power on the police. the government has accepted that such draconian power must be exercised through judicial supervision. it also concedes that the poto must make a distinction between a terrorist of foreign-origin and an indian national. ""we cannot treat a member of the lashkar-e-taiba and the hizbul mujahideen in the same manner,"" conceded a home ministry official. the union minister says that the government has accepted 7 of 9 proposals made by ncp leader sharad pawar at the all-party meeting on poto earlier this month. ""sharad pawar was keen that there be no comparison of poto with the mcoca act for tackling organised crime in maharashtra and we agree with that,"" said the official. while the government has accepted a number of provisions, it has yet to act on suggestions calling for stringent punishment for those misusing the law. the government is aware that the torrent of criticism that it has faced over poto is really a manifestation of the distrust the average citizen has for the law and order authorities, but it appears unable to act on this.

11,"Mamata snubs Cong, inches closer to BJP","kolkata: amid speculation of a fresh reshuffling in the union cabinet, trinamul congress chief mamata banerjee tried to warm up her relation with the bjp by opposing the congress demand of ban on bajrang dal. she also pulled up the congress for joining hand with the cpm on the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) issue and called it an 'unholy alliance' to pull down the vajpayee government. she even renewed her call to the congressmen to come out and join her fold in protest. notwithstanding her continued efforts to woo muslim voters with her customary presence and prayer in the iftar parties, mamata made it clear that she would stand by the centre on the controversial poto issue during the voting in parliament. earlier during the day, mamata's estranged ally and president of state congress pranab mukherjee sounded quite warm about the opposition unity in parliament against the nda government. however, he was equally cold about opposition unity in the state assembly where the trinamul congress would go for an no-confidence motion against buddhadeb bhattacharjee government. making digs against mukherjee as well as the congress leadership, mamata reminded him that the congress was in power at the centre when the the babri mosque was demolished. ""bajrang dal was proscribed earlier by the congress government. but the government failed to sustain the charges,'' said mamata. while her defence of bajrang dal left many of her rank and file visibly upset, she tried to balance the mood by reminding that it was she would opposed many a 'draconian' sections of the tada and would continue to raise concerns if something similar is found in the poto. before leaving for delhi, she renewed the charge of hypocrisy against the left front government for preparing a bill against organised crime while opposing the centre's ordinance of similar nature. mamata had apparently forgotten the problems of her own integrity as she lent support to advani's poto and opposed bhattacharjee's prevention of organized crime act in the same breath. and her men spoke of 'political compulsions' before the next bus for the rastrapati bhavan leaves.

12,Left leader criticise young party members,"kolkata: former west bengal finance minister asoke mitra on sunday lashed out against the new generation cpm leaders and ministers for wooing multinationals. speaking at a seminar organised by the dr dwarakanath kotnis memorial committee, mitra lamented the 'ideological confusion' and demoralisation among the left parties in the wake of the 'neo-colonial' globalisation. ""thirty years ago, leftist students and youths in kolkata forced former us secretary of state robert mcnamara to go back. i felt aghast to see that an upcoming youth leader, with his eyes glowing, was boasting about the arrival of microsoft in west bengal recently. the young minister was harping on our need to muster information technology. as if, microsoft will change the lives of our mute miliions,"" mitra maintained. lamenting ""the loss of class consciousness and idealism"" of the left supporters of yesteryears, the cpm leader observed that the present generation in many left families are no more interested in nationalist and revolutionary ideology of their fathers and grandfathers. ""they are now career-minded, consumer- culture oriented and america is their el dorado. ""gone are the days when marxists used to send young men and women to villages to gather firsthand understanding of the rural reality. now nobody thinks of it."" cautioning against the ""growing comprador mentality among a large section of the middle class"" both in west bengal and in the country, he said it was the middle class who led the anti-imperialist movements earlier. ""today, imperialist west has changed its strategies and rules the world through the world bank, imf, wto and multinationals. it has found the consent among a sizeable section of the middle class all over the world by promoting a consumerist blitzkrieg,"" said the veteran economist. reminding the ground reality , he said despite all the euphoria over joining the global economy, the growth rate of indian agriculture and industry have been outpaced by the growth of population in last decade. ""the future of the anti-imperialist movement depends much on the metamorphosis of the 'selfish' middle class as a socially concerned people once again,"" he cautioned.

20,State govt under fire over devdasi system,"kolhapur: even as our country has made giant strides in social and scientific fields, the age-old system of devdasi still continues to ruin the lives of thousands of women, mainly coming from the scheduled castes and tribes. maharashtra notoriously ranks among the three states worst affected by the inhuman practice of the devdasi system, under the garb of religion. karnataka and andhra pradesh are the other two states. and, kolhapur is no exception.an official survey conducted in 1993 in the district showed nearly 5,000 women who have fallen victim to the system. recent unofficial figures quoted by the anganwadi teachers showed that around 9,000 women are devdasis in the district. prof. sadhana zadbuke, an activist working in the field in kolhapur, blames the government for the social evil.traditional attitude and faulty government policies are responsible for this outrageous practice and its rise, says prof. zadbuke, who has been involved in the state-level devdasi mukti chalval for the last 20 years. prof zadbuke says 80 per cent of devdasis finally land in red light areas.they usually come from the scheduled castes and tribes. lack of education makes matters worse. young girls are married off to gods and goddesses such as yellamma, khandoba, hanuman and venkatesh pashupati in the months of march and april (chaitra poornima) under the garb of religion, she says. many devdasis boldly narrated their sordid saga to this correspondent without pleading for anonymity. indubai shende (84) says she was dumped into the practice when she was very young. the sexual trauma still haunts her. gaurabai dhanawde (55) and ganagubai yellappa powar (60) have similar stories to tell. santubai kurade (65) recalls her dedication ceremony to goddess yellama which took place when she was only seven years old. my mother, who was also a devdasi, got me married to the goddess, hoping to bear a male child, she says. it is believed that devdasis should have sex with multiple partners and collect alms for a living. besides this, they are also compelled to keep 'jatas' (unkempt hair) for the whole of their lives, which often result into spondilits and other neck ailments, besides hygiene problems. however, local ngos like samvedana,ingol foundation and a few others have helped bring about a sea change in the attitude of the local devdasi community. with the help of a few devdasi leaders, these ngos have managed to cut the 'jatas' of nearly 60 women from kolhapur city alone. yellubai patil aka maushi, a retired devdasi, who is working as a peer leader with the samvedana for the last 15-years, said she go around in the 'basti' and cut their 'jatas', besides making them aware about hiv/aids. the government gives pension of rs 300 per month to devdasis after they retire at the age of 40, under the women and child welfare department scheme. around 100 such women have benefited from the scheme. but the remaining are running from pillar to post to avail of the pension. prof. zadbuke ridicules the government scheme. on the one hand the government claims to eradicate the system and on the other hand it makes policies which demand an annual income certificate from these illiterate women. pension is refused to those aged below 40 years and also those who have an annual income of more than rs 15,000. likewise there is no pension scheme for eunuchs, she complains. nevertheless, these ostracised women continue their endeavour in spreading hiv/aids awareness and trying to eliminate the devdasi system. they have helped hundreds of devdasis come out of the flesh trade and start life afresh.the freed women are now making a living by selling vegetables, pickles and other things. local co-operatives and scheduled banks have also helped them with loans up to rs 10,000 for businesses.
