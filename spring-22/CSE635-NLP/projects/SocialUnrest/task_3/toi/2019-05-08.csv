0,"PWD facing fund shortage, says minister","KISHANGANJ: Public Works Department (PWD) of Bihar urgently needs a mammoth Rs 750 crore to complete the ongoing schemes in the state whereas the department has on its hands a measly Rs 28.90 crore under plan head and Rs 100 crore under non-plan head.

This amazing truth came right from horse''s mouth when Bihar PWD minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui revealed it before newsmen here on Tuesday morning.

Siddiqui, talking to mediapersons said that the state had taken up ""on top priority basis"" construction of 225-km-long national highway from Supaul to Galgalia which will meander through Pipra, Araria, Bahadurganj and Thakurganj and cater to the needs of this backward region contiguous to Bihar-Nepal border.

The PWD minister disclosed that the truncated Bihar has been allocated a sum of Rs 51 crore from the Central Road Fund (CRF). It would be utilised to construct a network of roads alongside Bihar-Nepal border which is of strategic significance. Barring one or two, most of such schemes were under progress, the minister said, adding that 75 more such schemes are under active consideration which would help lay a network of roads in districts like Purnia, Saharsa and Madhubani among others.

Siddiqui announced that all the wooden bridges across this district would be replaced with concrete RCC bridges soon which should go a long way in removing traffic hazards and substantially curtail recurring huge expenses in their upkeep.

The minister, who made a whirlwind tour of border districts to make an on-the-spot assessment of the ongoing schemes, indicated that many a departmental bigwigs and top-notch engineers, who had indulged into scams in execution of schemes, might find their heads rolling. He said show cause notices are being given to them.

Siddiqui said that Nabard was likely to sanction loans for replacing 45 bridges across the state, particularly in Madhubani and Araria districts, with RCC ones. Besides, Border Development Fund for roads was also sure to fund many such ambitious schemes in the state.

The PWD minister claimed that notwithstanding a lot of hue and cry, the PWD had done a significant job to improve the quality of works by making engineers and others accountable and trying to blacklist contractors who tried to siphon off funds without doing anything on the ground.

Siddiqui, who holds additional charge of commercial taxes department, claimed that the state had generated a whopping revenue of Rs 2,011 crore against the targeted Rs 1,885 crore whereas Jharkhand could collect barely Rs 750 crores.

1,Man arrested in duping case,"MUMBAI: The crime branch recently arrested one Surbajeetsingh Suri (26) for allegedly duping businessman Ramchandra Keswani (39) of Rs 10 lakhs by promising him a loan of Rs 2 crore.

The police said Mr Suri collected Rs 10.62 lakhs from Mr Keswani as a processing fee and registration charges for a loan, which he said, he would get sanctioned from the HSBC bank. Mr Suri also claimed that he would use the influence of S.C. Garg, a judge at the Bandra metropolitan court for the deal. However, police inquiries found that there was no judge by the name of S.C. Garg at the court.

The loan of Rs 2 crore, Mr Suri allegedly told Mr Keswani, would be at a nominal eight per cent rate of interest. However, even after Mr Keswani paid him the processing charges, Mr Suri did not get him the loan.

2,BJP announces stir against DF govt,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra unit of the BJP has announced a plan to agitate against the state government for its â€˜failure on all frontsâ€™.

State party president Pandurang Phundkar told reporters here on Monday that the first phase of the agitation would begin on May 25 with morchas to tehsil offices across the state. â€œThe BJP cannot remain a mute spectator to the havoc taking place all over Maharashtra,â€™â€™ he said.

Phundkar was briefing the press on the deliberations of a twoday meeting of the state BJP executive committee meeting held here over the weekend. The meeting was attended by BJP president Jana Krishnamurthy, Union minister Pramod Mahajan, and others. Veteran leader Anna Dangeâ€™s resignation from primary membership of the party was accepted by the executive.

Krishnamurthy is learnt to have said at the meeting that nobody was more important than the party, and that indiscipline would not be tolerated. State BJP spokesperson Atul Bhatkhalkar said that the meeting adopted two resolutions, one about the privations faced by farmers and the rural population, and the other about the alarming deterioration of the law and order situation in the state.

The first resolution has made eight demands of the state government. These include writing off 50 per cent of the electricity dues of farmers, providing work under the employment guarantee scheme to everyone asking for it, resolving drinking water problems of villages, initiating drought relief efforts, opening cattle camps, making payments to cotton growers and rescheduling farm loans.

The BJP, Mr Phundkar said, was the first to expose the scam in the Nagpur district central cooperative bank in the legislature. â€œCorruption is the norm with the Democratic Front government.

Many of its top leaders are involved in shady deals. Therefore, the executive committee has demanded that transactions of all district cooperative banks in Maharashtra be investigated,â€™â€™ he said. Mr Phundkar lamented that not a single minister had resigned despite clear evidence of government complicity.

Criticising the law and order situation, the partyâ€™s resolution said the police had become a laughing stock because of the embarrassment faced in cases like the arrest of Mohammed Afroze, the Gulshan Kumar murder case and the increasing Naxal activities in Vidarbha. Instead of investigating a sex scandal uncovered by party leader Gopinath Munde in the assembly, the government was trying to cover up the matter, it charged.

The resolution also expressed grave concern over the sliding credit rating of Maharashtra. Even staff salaries were not being paid on time. No developmental works were being undertaken.

3,Three arrested for extortion,"PUNE: A businessman and two of his accomplices posing as Dawoodâ€™s men have been arrested in an extortion case on Tilak road at Nigdi and remanded to police custody till May 13.

According to the crime branch authorities, the main accused â€” Adil Tapia (32) â€” of Somatne village near Talegaon, who owns a poultry farm at Parandwadi in Maval taluka, claimed money from another businessmen, Jagdish Patel of Tilak road at Nigdi who had purchased a plot of land near his farm. When Patel started construction work on his factory to manu-facture cement pipes, Tapia claimed that he had the power of attorney for the land and demanded money, the crime branch said.

When Patel refused to part with any cash without seeing the power of attorney, the accused, in December last year, allegedly took Frank Dâ€™Souza (30) and Nana Rao (30), both from Mumbai, to Patelâ€™s house. The three then allegedly extorted Rs 1 lakh at gun-point from Patelâ€™s father, saying they were Dawoodâ€™s men.

However, Tapia allegedly demanded money again from Patel recently, following which, he lodged a complaint. The crime branch sleuths, led by inspector Dattatraya Datar, laid a trap at Patelâ€™s residence on Sunday afternoon and arrested the three accused. Assistant inspector Satish Deore and sub-inspectors Avinash More and Satish Deore also took part in the operation.

4,Naidu for action against Central government,"HYDERABAD: Striking a tough posture against the Centre, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday mooted a joint action by â€œvictimâ€™â€™ states encountered with the problem of reduced central devolution in the taxes and said that an action plan would be prepared in consultation with other similar states.

Speaking to reporters, Naidu reiterated his charge that the performing states were being penalised by the Centre by drastically reducing devolutions. He said victim states should join together and bring pressure on the Centre. He, however, did not elaborate on the mode of the struggle or fight. â€œI am continuously fighting and I need your cooperation,â€™â€™ Naidu remarked.

The chief minister said the ratio of central taxes to total tax revenues had been declining since 1996-97. â€œThis ratio has steeply declined from 37.58 per cent to 25.78 per cent in 2001-02 and it is further likely to come down to 25.37 per cent during the current financial year,â€™â€™ Naidu observed.

Naidu said that this decline was forcing the state to go for additional mobilisation of own resources. According to the figures furnished by the government, while the tax revenue had gone up from Rs 7820.54 crore in 1996-97 to Rs 18,034.67 crore during 2002-03 budget estimates, the percentage of devolution came down from 37.58 to 25.37 for the period.

Naidu said that he would continue to fight with the Centre on this issue and recalled that the fight against the recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission did not yield substantial results. Naidu also disclosed that this matter would be taken up with other states which are facing similar problems. However, the Centre collects Rs 9953.36 crore from the state as central excise, customs, income tax and corporation tax which witnessed a 5.44 per cent growth compared to the previous year.

5,Reformists got ‘incentives’: WB,"HYDERABAD: The World Bank officially admitted to providing â€˜incentivesâ€™ to political leaders who took risks in implementing the reforms under its guidance in the country.

In a draft â€˜Strategic Directions for World Bank Engagementâ€™ in the Water Resources sector, under the section pertaining to Andhra Pradesh, the bank feels that, â€œThe art of reform is defining a sequenced, prioritised set of reform actions, of picking the lowhanging fruit first, and ensuring an appropriate incentive system for political leaders who take these risks.â€�

According to the bank, the reform process can be â€œmost effective when it identifies reforming political leaders and provides them with the backing for their reform programmes,â€� which can be inferred to mean that the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh N Chandrababu Naidu, as the bank feels, is the â€˜first and strongest reformer.â€™ However, the World Bank admits that efforts to promote reform, often had little result, and hence in recent years, it has taken a radically different position in India.

The bank feels that the central issue is not â€˜visionâ€™, but â€˜how to move from here to thereâ€™ or the â€˜political economy of reform.â€™ Also, the bank is able to â€˜exert little leverage through conditionalityâ€™. In a highly controversial observation, the bank mentions that it is difficult to reform the performance of the managers of the irrigation department, which the state government realises as the next challenge.

In what could ultimately lead to the privatisation of the irrigation department, the draft mentions that the discussions between the bank and the government are â€œcentring on the assessment of options for developing service providers which operate on modern institutional principles, including competition and accountability to users, and for management and maintenance of assets.â€�

The bank maintains that the challenge in the state is to assist the state in its efforts to be a â€˜facilitatorâ€™ in the management of the water resources and â€œthe World Bank is likely to remain a central partner for both advice and investments in advancing this ambitious and vital agenda.â€�

Coming to the contentious issue of privatisation of the urban water sector, the bank clearly states that it has â€œdecided to discontinue financing of urban utilities unless they are associated with major institutional reforms,â€� and that the bank is focusing its advisory services on states â€œwhich have shown commitment to fiscal and institutional reforms.â€�

6,Govt willing to hike aid for farmers,"DHARWAD: The state government had an open mind on paying compensation to the kin of farmers who committed suicide and a decision on the Veeresh Committee report would be taken after examining various aspects carefully, Agriculture Minister T B Jayachandra said here on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters at the University of Agricultural Sciences, he said that the chief minister would decide on the Veeresh Committee report at the next cabinet meeting.

The minister said that the government was in favour of farmers using biotech seeds and warned that anybody coming in the way of such farmers (making use of biotech seeds) would be severely dealt with.

He decried the opposition to the use of BT seeds and modern techniques of cultivation and said some people were engaged in ``false propaganda'''' against BT seeds.

Jayachandra said the government was committed to providing Rs 12 crore as aid to the paddy grown in rain-fed area in 34 taluks of seven districts as promised by the chief minister. Dharwad and Belgaum districts are in the list.

Senior IAS officer Sudheer Kumar and Deputy Commissioner Kapil Mohan were present at the press conference.

7,Radio still rules the airwaves,"MANGALORE: For Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, cardiologist, who grew up in a village near Kasargod, radio was the only means of information. Even now after the advent of cable television, he firmly believes that radio can still dominate if it can respond to listeners'' aspirations.

Dr Elizabeth Daniel, child psychologist, believes that between TV and radio, the latter is ""more imaginative"" than the former.

R Vittal Shenoy of Paanjalu is an agriculturist by profession. His association with radio dates back to 1948, when rural radio fora was in existence. To him, radio still has relevance and he regularly listens to some of his favourite programmes diligently.

Eminent writer Amruth Someshwara regards radio as having given a fillip to Tulu literature and Yakshagana. For writers like him, interface with several other intellectuals has become a reality because of radio.

These are a few of the many voices which ring out in appreciation for the services of the All India Radio (AIR), Mangalore.

But is radio losing its relevance in the age of information technology boom and the advent of cable television? Far from ringing the death knell, radio is carving a niche for itself by re-programming and responding itself interactively to listeners'' aspirations here, says Mangalore AIR assistant station director C.U. Bellakki.

Affirming his view is the audience research survey undertaken by the AIR in Dakshina Kannada recently. Since the inception of the Mangalore station in 1976, barring a survey in 1983, there had been no effort to study and assess listenership trends to the station''s programmes.

Bellakki told Times News Network that when the study was planned, the broad objectives were hinged to assessing the existing levels of radio programmes, whether people were aware of the changes brought about in programmes and to identify listeners'' choices.

The results which emerged from the survey were surprising, to say the least. Bellakki said that listening to radio in rural areas was close to 97 per cent, while in urban areas it was 92 per cent. But what about frequency?

Only 5 per cent never listened and 40 per cent did listen to radio frequently. While regular listening (over a week) was over 50 per cent in rural areas, it was above 25 per cent in urban areas.

Bellakki maintains that analysis of the research data showed that AIR''s innovative and imaginative programmes had brought back listeners to the medium in large numbers. He said that despite the presence of 60-odd TV channels, radio programmes registering 30-50 per cent actual listening is, indeed, heartening.

Bellakki notes that interactive programmes have paid dividends in a big way, adding that utilitarian and need-based programmes can certainly make invasions into other media territory.

In this regard, the station has been airing informative, educative and entertaining programmes like Nela Nammadu Jala Nammadu (13 episodes on water, soil conservation), Sassya Sourabha (on medicinal plants), Rangasthala (interview programme with eminent Yakshagana artists) and Swara Sampada (feature on great musicians).

Its phone-in programmes like Hello Hello (monthly grievance redressal programme), Hello Putta Putti (programme for children), Rasaganga (listeners'' choice programme of film and folk songs), Daari Deepa (employment opportunities), Tallaana (on adolescent health problems), Adenendu Helu (programme based on riddles), Prajaprathinidhi (interaction with elected representatives), Vaidyarondige Beti (meet the doctor), Mahila Loka (programme on women''s problems), etc, have been registering increased listenership.

Bellakki says the Mangalore station will pursue a more rigorous programme strategy to expand its existing territory.

``While the visual medium focuses mainly on entertainment-based communication, I would like this medium to focus on information and education to make it more appealing to listeners,'''' adds Bellakki.

8,"Stay out of politics, minister tells SHGs","MANGALORE: Former minister Jayaprakash Hegde advised members of self-help groups (SHGs) not to indulge in politics, but work for the development of the people.

He was speaking at a seminar of SHGs organised by the Netravathi Grameena Bank at Brahmavar recently. Nearly 300 women members of 30 SHGs were present. He also distributed loans to seven SHGs on the occasion.

9,Report on farmers' suicide dumped in dustbin,"BANGALORE: In a novel protest against the G.K. Veeresh Committee report on farmers' suicide, Legislative Council Opposition leader K.H. Srinivas on Tuesday dumped the report in a waste-paper basket. Speaking to reporters here, Srinivas said the report defies all logic and reasoning besides being an insult to the farming community. ``The report is a cruel joke played by perverted people on innocent farmers which deserves to be dumped into the dustbin,'' he added. Ridiculing the report for making ``childish'' observations, Srinivas said it is common sense that suicide is an ultimate act based on several factors and there cannot be any one reason. ``Was there any need for an experts committee to say this?,'' he asked. Taking strong exception to one of the recommendation that the government must instil pride, confidence and self-respect among farmers, Srinivas said it is an insult to the farming community who, despite many hurdles, has made the country self-reliant in food production. ``This particular recommendation is in bad taste,'' he said.According to Srinivas, the report is prejudiced as it could be made out by the terms of reference set by the government. ``The government wanted the report in a particular way and the committee has obliged,'' he said.Urging Chief Minister S.M. Krishna to pay compensation to all the families of the farmers who committed suicide, Srinivas demanded that there should be a ban on the auctioning of farmers' lands irrespective of the size of his loan. ``If Krishna is sincere in retaining his pro-farmer image which he started cultivating through his budget address, he should act quickly on these lines,'' he added.

12,World no better for children since 1990,"HYDERABAD: Except for a decrease in the infant mortality rate, there has been no change in the living condition of children in Andhra Pradesh since 1990.

According to Unicef State representative William B Thompson, out of every 100 children in Andhra Pradesh, more than six die before they become one year old. There is a tremendous disparity of the chance for survival after one year in urban areas, with a infant mortality rate (IMR) of 37, compared to rural areas, where the IMR is 75.

Only 32 per cent of children born in the state have their births registered.

Out of every 100 children, 38 are moderately to severely malnourished, 23 of the babies born are severely underweight, 72 of the children suffer from anaemia, only about 59 have been immunised, only 49 boys and 31 girls complete their primary school, 80 girls get married by 18 and 49 girls get married by 15.

Thompson said the data has been collected from various official sources including National Family Health Services and Census-2001.

Among the achievements, there is a decrease in growth rate since 1990 and the state IMR has come down by 19 per cent. The pre-primary attendance has been increased to some extent when compared to other states.

According to a Unicef report, there are presently about 2.1 billion children in the world, accounting for 35 per cent of the worldâ€™s population. Globally, one in four children lives in abject poverty â€” with families receiving an income of less than Rs 50 a day. One of every 12 children dies before it turns five, mostly from preventable causes.

Of every 100 children in the world, 55 are born in Asia (10 in India, 18 in China), 16 in sub-Saharan Africa, eight in Latin America and the Caribbean, seven in the Middle East/North Africa, six in Eastern Europe and eight in the industrialised countries. Of them, 27 are not immunised against any disease, 32 suffer from malnutrition during the first five years of their lives, 18 have no access to clean drinking water, 39 live without adequate sanitation and 18 never go to school.

15,Paswan blames Modi govt for continuing riots,"AHMEDABAD: Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan, who recently resigned from the Vajpayee government, has squarely blamed the state administration for the continuing violence in Gujarat.

On Wednesday, he accused the Narendra Modi government of lacking a political will to restore normalcy.

""There is no no government in Gujarat. Dalits and minorities have lost confidence in the BJP Government. If Chief Minister Narendra Modi has a political will, only then he can restore peace in the state,"" Paswan, who is on a day-long visit to the riot-hit state, told reporters here.

Paswan, accompanied by his brother MP Ramchandra Paswan and MP Jainarain Nishad, visited Vikram Sarabhai and L G hospitals, Shah Alam camp and several affected areas and exchanged views with the people of different communities.

Paswan said he would lead a delegation of his party leaders to President K R Narayanan on Thursday and submit a memorandum on the prevailing situation in Gujarat.

He appealed to dalits and minorities not to fall prey to the vested interests bent upon destroying the age-old ties.

17,Hizb to boycott J&K Assembly polls,"SRINAGAR: The dominant Pakistan-backed Kashmiri militant outfit the Hizbul Mujahideen on Wednesday announced its decision to boycott the forthcoming assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir. The Hizb also warned of severe punishment for those who took part in the polls.

""Elections held under the Indian Constitution will be boycotted by Hizbul Mujahideen ,"" said Saif-ul-Islam, Chief Commander of Hizb''s operations, in a statement to a local news agency.

Without making any reference to the growing revolt against the Pakistan based supreme commander of the outfit Syed Salahuddin by top commanders in J&K, Islam said thousands of militants owing allegiance to Hizbul Mujahideen have been directed to take action against those involved in the elections.

""Any group or organisation which will take part in the elections will cause harm to the Kashmir cause and so all of them will be treated as traitors and cannot escape punishment"", he added.

Islam said it was a ""useless exercise"" for Hizbul Mujahideen to take part in elections since it considers participating in it as a ""defeat for ourselves"".

Meanwhile, another senior commander Abu Ubaid joined the chorus of attacks against the Hizbul leadership in Pakistan for expelling three former top commanders of the outfit in J&K saying it was done in haste.

18,Vote-bank politics means no resettlement,"AHMEDABAD: Why is the Narendra Modi government completely ruling out the possibility of the resettlement of riot-hit refugees to new, safer sites? Is it vote-bank politics, more than anything else, which stands in the way of refugees and their desire to find a new home?

In the answers to these questions, perhaps, lies the key to whether Gujarat will return to peace or continue on its seemingly unstoppable course of violence. Rough estimates prepared by the government suggest an overwhelming number of one lakh refugees, who have spent the last two months in camps, would like an alternative site for resettlement rather than return to their hostile neighbourhoods.

The view was only strengthened on Sunday when violence sparked off after a group of refugees from the Shah-e-Alam camp, who were returning home in Behrampura, met with resistance from their estranged neighbours. And yet, both Chief Minister Narendra Modi and chief secretary G Subba Rao have completely discounted the possibility of the government identifying alternative resettlement sites, like it did on a large-scale during the earthquake, for the riot victims.

Government officials linked to rehabilitation measures in Ahmedabad, where there are 65,000 refugees still staying in camps, admit that even to suggest resettlement sites is sacrilege.

""The fact is that there is land available for resettlement only on the outskirts of Ahmedabad but none, politicians or residents, would like a chunk of Muslims to be resettled in their area. The politician would not want it because of the vote-bank factor and residents because they don''t want a Muslim ghetto around.""

Sample this. Even though there is considerable land under the control of the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (Auda) in the Sarkhej area where safe resettlement sites can be created, the local population would not approve of this. Juhapura which is the largest Muslim ghetto in Gujarat having 2.5 lakh residents is close to this area.

""The point is that one Juhapura is enough to create tension in the entire constituency and we don''t want any more such ghettos to upset the situation,"" says a leader of the area.

Besides, the leader said, any move to create a new Muslim settlement in the largely Hindu-dominated western areas of Ahmedabad would be stoutly resisted by the local residents even if the government relents finally.

Modi gave no assurance to Shah-e-Alam camp chief Mohsin Quadri and Ahmedabad Shehar Ekta Samiti member Mohammedhusen Memon, who met him here on Saturday, pleading that they should be resettled at a place other than their original place of living. ""The chief minister or state officials are still not ready to agree on the need to provide these victims a separate piece of land for resettlement,"" said Quadri.

Officials say that even in eastern Ahmedabad areas like Rakhial, Ramol, Chandola, Pirana, Narol and Vatva, pockets could be found to resettle some of the victims as large tracts of land belong to the revenue department. But even here, the vote dynamics in the assembly constituencies would get upset.

Sharif Khan Pathan, a builder who assists the running of some camps, says, ""We are aware that there is vote-bank politics behind this, but the fact is that having seen death from such close quarters, returning to their homes is out of question for most victims.""

19,"MCC polls: BJP promises water, infrastructure","MANGALORE: The BJP manifesto for the Mangalore City Corporation polls has accorded top priority for supply of drinking water, apart from ample assurances of improving infrastructure and making the city clean and beautiful.

The manifesto, released by Union Minister of State for Textiles V. Dhananjaya Kumar on Tuesday, enumerates the actions to be taken up by the BJP - if it comes to power. The manifesto has also assured the voters that it would urge the state government to withdraw the unscientific (SAS) self-assessment property tax system in its present form.

Regarding the self assessment property tax, the manifesto states that a final decision would be taken only after having a detailed discussion with the town planners, people''s representaives and all party members.

Kumar said the manifesto also laid stress on developing the Bajpe Airport to internaional standards and setting up of a passport office here.

The lackadaisical attitude of the corporation authorities while taking up repair works would be mended so that works would be expedited, he said.

Kumar noted that the MCC should have got its share of Rs 35 crore grants from the state government for repair of 800 km of road, instead it had got only Rs 18 crore. The BJP will attempt to secure the full share, he claimed.

Strangely, the manifesto does not make a mention for shifting the service bus-stand from Hampanakatta. The BJP felt that the existing system could be strengthened to fulfil the needs.

BJP leaders Yogish Bhat, BJP city unit president Monappa Bhandari, former MP Jayaram Shetty, Narayan Shetty, D.V. Sadananda Gowda, alleged that the Congress was not able to provide good administration during its tenure due to its infighting. They said lack of vision and leadership had weakened their hold on the officials and the developmental works had suffered.

20,IPPs face raw deal as govt plays waiting game,"BANGALORE: Sixteen months after the independent power producers (IPP) policy banning escrow was announced by Karnataka, IPPs are scrambling to save their projects with alternate payment security mechanisms (PSM).

Karnataka is reeling under power shortage with experts predicting 16-hour shutdowns in villages within eight years, but the state government is not ready to support the IPPs, who can provide over 2000 MW in four years.

``We prefer to depend on the Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC) because we are not forced to pay up precisely on time, since it is a government organisation,'''' a senior energy official told The Times of India.

In 1996-97, the government cleared power purchase agreements with 14 IPPs in the hope of meeting the rising power demand. ``But we do not have the money to buy so much power even if there is need. So we don''t want them,'''' the official maintained.

The IPPs, including Mangalore Power Company (Cogentrix), Nagarjuna and Atria, have already invested hundreds of crores into their projects and are reluctant to close shop and wash their hands of their money. While MPC representatives said: ``We are still awaiting action from the state government and KPTC,'''' Nagarjuna and Atria have moved the Karnataka High Court.

IPP representatives contend that financial institutions will not fund projects unless some kind of PSM is given by the government and KPTC. Atria''s case is still being decided by the high court while the judgment in the Nagarjuna case has directed the government to negotiate with the IPP and come up with a PSM agreeable to both.

Three options have been suggested by CRISIL to KPTC on payment security for IPPs. The most favoured is still escrow and a state government-guarantee and the other two options are a reforms-based agreement similar to the one signed for the Unit 7 of Raichur Thermal Power Station (RTPS) or a reserve fund collected through a specific cess from the people, which will function as a default payment account.

``The idea behind the reforms-linked RTPS agreement was that once the sector improves, income won''t be a problem. This has not worked out in the case of Unit 7, so a more stringent agreement is necessary,'''' IPP representatives contended.

The cess option envisages an account similar to ELRTS or the road cess on petrol or sales tax. ``We are examining all options. But it is up to the KPTC board and government to decide whether we should take these up or not,'''' KPTC Chairman V.P. Baligar said.

21,Scribes' arrest: Minister protests innocence,"BANGALORE: Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister M Y Ghorpade on Wednesday claimed he was a mere ``pawn'''' in the recent incident where reporters trying to meet him in Nagarhole were placed under arrest.

``The forest officials asked me if I had invited the journalists. I said no. That is all I know about it.''''

``If some journalists use my name and get into a prohibited area, am I responsible for their arrest by forest officials?'''' he asked.

A misinformation campaign had been spread against him that he was relaxing in Nagarahole when the entire state was struggling for drinking water. ``I took three days off to visit my grandchildren. People spend days on end without a care in five-star hotels, but everyone only talks about my holiday. Even in Sunkadakatte, I checked the level of borewell water before going to Nagarahole,'''' he contended.

22,Assam tightens pursestrings for ministers,"GUWAHATI: Ministers in cash-starved Assam are in for a pay-cut soon.

Compelled by intense political pressure to expand his ministry â€” notwithstanding empty coffers â€” Assam Chief kinister Tarun Gogoi on Wednesday announced a 20 per cent cut in pay and travelling allowance of all his ministers.

â€˜â€˜We would also fix a ceiling as far as the reimbursement of telephone bills is concerned. This particular measure would be applicable to bureaucrats as well,â€™â€™ Gogoi said. He, however, ruled out any cut in the salaries of state government employees.

24,Modi faces ministers' ire over violence,"GANDHINAGAR: For the first time since the communal disturbances began in Gujarat on February 27, several top Cabinet ministers questioned the ability of the state administration under Chief Minister Narendra Modi to control the continuing violence in the state. They also wanted to know what exactly was the brief for â€˜â€˜super copâ€™â€™ K.P.S. Gill. The ministers including the Industry Minister Suresh Mehta, who is number 2 in the Cabinet, Water Resources Minister Narottam Patel, Finance Minister Nitin Patel, Energy Minister Kaushik Patel and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Fakir Vaghela raised the issue at Wednesdayâ€™s weekly cabinet meeting here. Mehta, who fired the salvo, particularly asked the CM to explain why K.P.S. Gill was appointed security adviser. The view was strong among all the ministers that the BJPâ€™s image was taking a downward turn as a result of the â€˜â€˜inabilityâ€™â€™ of the government to control the situation. They said that both Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Union home minister L.K. Advani had said that the riots were a â€˜â€˜blot on the face of the party.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜How should one explain to the ordinary party workers when such statements are made by the Central leadership? What is the meaning of such statements?â€™â€™ asked several ministers. The ministers, expressing concern on the law and order situation, said the effectiveness of the police was going down, the business community was getting disillusioned with the party, there was virtually no combing operations in areas which are known to be hot-spots of tension. They said that everything possible should be done to stop the violence. The CM, who had never before faced such ire from the ministers, was on the defensive. He explained away by saying that steps such as appointment of Gill, starting of combing operations, and finding out the culprits were being taken. Coming out of the Cabinet meeting, a senior minister told this correspondent on condition of anonymity, â€˜â€˜We said there should be enough preparedness to fight the difficult situation arising out of the disturbances. We were assured that Gill, with his commando force, would effectively curb violence.â€�
