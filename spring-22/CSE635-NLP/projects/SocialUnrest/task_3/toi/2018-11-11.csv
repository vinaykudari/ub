0,Activists lobby for good candidates in civic polls,"mumbai: a civic activist ran into a senior politician at a music concert the other day, and they started chatting about the forthcoming civic polls. the activist, a member of agni (action for good governance and networking in india), elaborated on the ngo's efforts to instil better governance in the corporation, to which the politician yawned and said, ``laudable, but unfortunately you represent such a tiny english-speaking constituency, that you're not going to make a difference.'' the agni member raised his eyebrows and replied, ``don't be mistaken. within the various organisations that come under our umbrella, we cover a lot of people.'' politician, ``numbers bolo.'' civic activist, ``hmmm. about five lakhs.'' at this, the politician balked, ran an invisible calculator in his head, and suddenly changed his tune. he followed the activist all the way down the grand stairs of the concert hall and scribbled his number on the programme brochure, asking him to stay in touch. if that encounter is any indication, even the most hardened city politicians probably won't ignore the registered letters and calls from civic activists that will soon start bombarding their party offices. for agni is now poised for phase ii of its action plan to improve the calibre of what is perhaps the largest and richest civic body in the country, the brihanmumbai municipal corporation. phase i involved getting more like-minded citizens to enrol in the electoral rolls and generating awareness. says additional municipal commissioner gautam chatterjee, ``from all accounts, their efforts have been quite successful.'' now, three months before the polls, civic activists are planning to approach local party heads and urge them to nominate good candidates. what does `good' mean? ``that they should have no criminal record, for one,'' says agni activist gerson da cunha, pointing out that in the last several years, the calibre of corporators has been steadily declining. agni's list of demands include the following--that the candidates should be willing to reveal their assets on a quarterly basis, that they agree to hold monthly meetings with their constituents and share with them precisely how they are spending the rs 20 lakhs in development funds. it also requires that candidates agree, in writing, not to support the unruly disruption of proceedings in the house, and not to support any strikes which would cause the tax-paying citizens of mumbai any hardship. civic officials feel that political parties will have to take cognizance of these demands. as mr chatterjee says, ``this code of conduct requirement will at least put some pressure on the parties to put up better candidates.'' indeed, politicians, who will start deciding their nominees after the bmc finalises all seat reservations next week, realise the need to balance their political compulsions with the demands of this new pressure group. as mumbai bjp president vinod tawde says, ``when it comes to corporation elections, even 500-1,000 votes can make all the difference to results.'' he cites the last civic elections in which more than 89 of the 221 seats were won or lost thanks to less than 500 votes. adds mr tawde, ``the bjp welcomes this move to improve the quality of candidates and i think all parties should, but there is one technical loophole as far as the criteria on criminal background is concerned. some of our party workers were arrested during the emergency or during the ram mandir movement, so they may have a criminal record, but that doesn't mean they are criminals.'' in the next few weeks, agni will ask the political parties to highlight their vision on critical civic subjects, including slums, encroachments and water. finally, it will ask the parties to lay down the five main characteristics of the candidates they are putting up. says mr chatterjee, ``after all, people are suddenly realising that the outcome of these polls affects everyone's day-to-day lives--whether it is roads, drains, garbage or taxes.''

4,Dholai harbour in Valsad to be ready before polls,"vadodara: the state government is all set to establish the first ever 'fishery harbour' in gujarat. the rs 11.70 crore project at dholai in valsad district, has got the centre's green signal, fisheries, labour and employment minister kanjibhai patel told tnn. the government has begun acquiring land, making budgetary provisions and will ask new delhi-based engineers india limited to prepare an environment assessment (eia) report. with the elections just 15 months away, the state government seems to be in a hurry to speed up the project. patel, who got the fisheries portfolio last month, resolved a long-standing issue of payments to the firm. the eia reportedly got delayed by three months after the firm sought advance payments. all the three minor fishery harbours at veraval, mangrol and porbandar are located in saurashtra. another minor fishery harbour at jakhau on the kutch coast is under construction, said patel. the bigger mechanised fishing vessels (mfvs) operating in and around dholai now have to travel long distances by sea to use the ferry wharf at mumbai to dispose off their catch due to lack of suitable fish landing facilities and markets in the region. the distance between dholai and mumbai being about 230 km, fishermen of dholai find it convenient to stay and operate from mumbai during fishing season and return to dholai village during off season. fishermen feel, if landing and berthing facilities are provided at dholai, considerable amount of fuel and time can be saved. fishing vessels are parked upland on either side of the banks of river ambika. during the fishing season, they catch fish off south gujarat coast and land their catch at the new ferry wharf in mumbai. valsad district, with 116 km long coast line, has nine important fishing villages around dholai _ mendher, bhavri, bhatt, kukwasi, nani danti, moti danti, mithiya, dandi and bhagal. the district, however, does not have a fishery harbour. the fishing zones off valsad are reported to be rich in prawn. statistics of 1995-96 reveal that the number of non -mechanised fishing craft operating in valsad has been dwindling over the years. it came down to 548 from 1,140 in 1982. though valsad has no full-fledged fishery harbour, the district contributes 12 per cent of the marine fish production of gujarat. the fishing season in valsad generally commences in september and lasts up to may-end. according to patel, the state government is keen in increasing the fish production to meet the rising demand and earn foreign exchange by exporting processed sea-foods. and, with gujarat topping the list in marine fish production in india, the government realised the need to upgrade the fish landing centre at dholai, he added.

11,'Possibility of war cannot be ruled out',"chennai: the possibility of a war between india and pakistan could not be ruled out if hardliners deposed pakistani president pervez musharraf as he might use the opportunity to ""unite"" his countrymen, according to top army officials at the college of combat in mhow (madhya pradesh). even if musharraf was able to stave off a crisis, arising out of protests in pakistan against his support to the us-led onslaught on afghanistan, he might ""indulge"" in a war with india, they said. the officials told reporters from chennai, who visited the college recently, that they had presented to the defence ministry, several scenarios arising out of the conflict in afghanistan. they replied in the negative when asked if pakistan army's border exercises had caused any worry to india. they said that the on-going war against terrorism in afghanistan would not succeed unless the us despatched ground forces, adding ""mere bombings are not enough"". one could not say how long the conflict would continue as there were a variety of factors to be taken into account. none was aware of the present strength of the taliban and northern alliance forces. the terrain was also a difficult one, the army officials said. india's stand of supporting the northern alliance was a ""perfect one"", they said, adding india would have a key role to play in the afghan war if hardliners staged a coup in pakistan. the us would then have to totally depend on india. the centre should go in for ""hot pursuit"" of terrorists in pak-occupied kashmir and destroy their training camps, they said. asked about the possibility of nuclear weapons being used in an india-pakistan war, the officials said that india would not use them as a first option, but retaliate within a reasonable time if forced to do so. indian nuclear weapons are more deterrant than that of pakistan, they said. the officials, who are teaching war strategies to army personnel, opined that if the war against terrorism was a prolonged one, it might create a cultural divide in the world with muslim countries starting to support the taliban. stating that future wars would be fully electronic, they said that the indian army was developing suitable software. ""it might take a couple of years,"" they said.
