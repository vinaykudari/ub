0,A peace initiative with political message,"AHMEDABAD: Peace moves to promote communal harmony are not uncommon post-2002 riots.

But what makes â€˜Meri Awaz Sunoâ€” Youth Aman Karwanâ€™ unique is its express purpose of motivating the 2.75 crore first-time voters to elect a government â€˜that does not promote communal hatredâ€™.

Twenty seven youth, mostly students from all over India, have embarked on a plan to cover 40 cities from April 7 to May 7. â€œIt is a totally political move,â€� says Shabnam Hashmi, founder member of ANHAD (Act Now for Harmony and Democracy), whose youth wing began this journey.

During this phase, Hashmi also plans to attract youth organisations, that have been working for peace, to build a network. Says Kandala Singh, a Delhi student associated with ANHAD since its inception in March, 2003, â€œThough I canâ€™t say exactly how much of a difference we will make, there is optimism because we know that a lot of people believe in peace. Itâ€™s just a question of pushing them.â€�

The team also includes Yasin Allarakha and Rizwan Ayub from Kalol, who originally belonged to Delol, one of the worst riothit areas.

Says, Yasin, â€œI lost my father, grandmother and brother-in-law. I donâ€™t want others to suffer the way I did.â€� Says Rizwan, â€œEven today we canâ€™t go back to Delol. We donâ€™t want this government to return.â€� Sumeet Popli from Delhi adds, â€œItâ€™s open knowledge that the views of RSS are based on Hitlerâ€™s fascist ideology. These have to be curbed.â€� Swapnil Gupta, also from Delhi, says, â€œOur democracy is in danger as secularism â€” the core of our identityâ€” is being attacked.â€� Says Hashmi, â€œThe fight is now on an intellectual level and I want to build a cadre of such youngsters.â€� Undaunted by the absence of many youth at the meeting, Hashmi adds, â€œBy the time we finish touring 40 cities, I am sure some difference will be made.â€�

If for nothing else, the movement gains credibility in the conviction of the 27 who have undertaken the journey. â€œIf we donâ€™t raise our voice in protest now, after five years, we will not have a voice to raise,â€� they echo.

1,Ex-teachers make the political arena their classroom,"AHMEDABAD: If historysheeters rule politics in Bihar, it is the â€˜gurusâ€™, who are out to capture politics in Gujarat.

â€œShikshak kabhi sadharan nahin hota, pralay aur kranti inki gode me palte hainâ€� reads the pamphlet quoting master strategist Chanakya circulated by Vitthal Pandya, father of slain BJP leader Haren Pandya.

Pandya, a retired school teacher contesting against LK Advani as an Independent, is one more addition to the big number of teachers who have moved out of their classrooms to create a political revolution of sorts. Interestingly, Pandya has chosen a book as his symbol.

Ratilal Verma, Harin Pathak, Shankersinh Vaghela, Ramila Bara, Ramsinh Rathwa, Madhusudan Mistry, are some of the other â€˜gurusâ€™ in fray for Lok Sabha elections 2004. Not to forget education minister Anandiben Patel and senior Congress leader Urmilaben Patel, who are leading the way, campaigning hard for the candidates.

Though their earlier jobs and the prospective one may have little in common, they could encash on their skills to compel a crowd to listen to them, be it is the classroom, the Parliament or a public meeting. While Verma is presently working as a principal in Pandit Nehru Vidya Vihar Secondary School in Behrampura, Harin Pathak took voluntary retirement from Nalanda High School in Saraspur, where he taught.

If Shankersinh Vaghela worked as an NCC instructor in a college in Unjha, Ramsinh Rathwa, BJPâ€™s candidate from Chotta Udepur, was an art teacher in Jiwan Sadhna School in Vadodara. And, while Ramila Bara, BJPâ€™s candidate from Sabarkantha worked as an assistant teacher in Maharaja High School in Vijaynagar in Sabarkantha earlier, her rival Madhusudhan Mistry delivers lectures in many institutes.

â€œI believe teachers can become better politicians. Teachers can stop criminalisation of politics,â€� says Pandya. He believes that teachers are scared of entering politics for a variety of reasons. â€œPerhaps, the ugliness of politics is scaring them. But the scene will certainly improve if more such people come out,â€� he adds. Harin Pathak believes that his teaching career has helped him immensely in politics. â€œIn the course of 1969 to 1992 (the year when he took voluntary retirement), I must have come in contact with at least 60,000 families.

Some of my old students have grandchildren who are eligible to vote,â€� he says. However, isnâ€™t the two professions poles apart â€” one a pious profession and the other a corrupt occupation. â€œPolitics is a science. And no science can be bad. Itâ€™s the people in it who are bad,â€� he says. According to him, there are bad people in all professions, so why blame only politicsâ€�, argues Shankersinh Vaghela.

Anandiben Patel, who used to teach science and maths in Mohiniba Kanya Vidyalaya in Ahmedabad and later went to become the principal of the same school before she took voluntary retirement to pursue full-time politics, confesses tenure as a teacher has helped her as a becoming a good politician. â€œIf you have been a teacher, you bring discipline to politicsâ€�, says Patel. Not only this, teachers also get an ready-made team of followers. â€œWherever I campaign, I invariable meet one of my old student who come up to pay his respect. Once the link is established, many take up the responsibility to campaign for me in that village,â€� says Patel.

â€œIn my 30 years at the SV College, I have taught over 50,000 students. In fact, many of my students are active in rival parties too but do not fail to touch my feet whenever they see me,â€� says Urmilaben Patel.

2,This may be the cheapest election yet,"AHMEDABAD: â€œYesterday I saw one new poster on a wall and went up close to take a look and guess what it turned out to be â€” an advertisement for an ice-cream!â€� â€” remarked N Murugan, senior election observer from Tamil Nadu and in-charge of the Dollarrich Anand constituency.

Not just election observers from poll-charged states who are posted in Gujarat, but even corporate houses, who are accustomed to being fleeced by fund-raisers, claim that something is â€˜amissâ€™ this elections. They admit that no politician is chasing them this time.

So is this going to be the cheapest elections ever held in Gujarat? It is expected that the government will spend about Rs 40 crore on conducting the elections in Gujarat. When elections were announced, it was estimated that at least Rs 100 crore would be pumped in by the candidates and the parties put together.However, election observers say this now needs a drastic downward revision.

So stark is the absence of election fever that some observers in their reports to the Election Commission (EC) have made a note of the conspicuous â€œlullâ€� in a state known for its money power. Says Murugan, â€œwe are really surprised, because when I left Chennai, every wall was reserved for posters of Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaâ€�.

The BJP candidate in Anand, Jayprakash Patel, is the richest in Gujarat going by his affidavit, but obviously it is not showing in his campaign. In fact, companies are surprised that even the minor demands like footing expenses of boarding and lodging for party workers or ones in kind like cars and banners are few.

â€œApart from some stray demands for small favours, we havenâ€™t been approached in a big way by parties. Usually, we get frantic calls from party officials,â€� concedes an official of a Bharuch-based pharmaceutical firm. â€œUsually, we are approached by parties at least a month before the polls. But this time, we have had no demands,â€� explains a top official of an Ahmedabad-based corporate house.

Ex-finance minister Manmohan Singh, who was in Gujarat on Saturday, had an interesting answer to this. â€œThis is a ruthless government, any industrial house that approaches the Opposition with funds gets a call either from the I-T or FERA officials.â€�

Star campaigners like Shankersinh Vaghela too have stayed away from what they call, â€˜show-baaziâ€™. Another observer from south India, posted in north Gujarat, explains the lull, â€œElectors here have already decided who to vote for, so candidates feel there is no point in wasting money.â€�

The promoter of an FMCG company agrees with this: â€œWith the outcome of the election so clear, most of the industry funding is flowing towards the expected winner to keep them happy.â€� A top official of an Ahmedabad-based corporate house attributes the lacklustre fund-raising to the centralisation of funding at Delhi and the strict implementation of the code of conduct.

3,Who cares once polls are over?,"PUNE: If wishes were horses, political manifestos released just before elections could well be the magic wand that could transform Pune dramatically, every five years.

However, the track record of the candidates and political parties tells a different story.

Mega-projects such as the SkyBus mass transportation system and CNG-powered public transport have been promised by the two MPs from Pune â€” BJPâ€™s Pradeep Rawat and Congressâ€™s Suresh Kalmadi (Rajya Sabha). But little was done in the last five years to sincerely solve the worsening traffic congestion in the city.

This was the period when Pune acquired the dubious distinction of being the fifth most polluted city in Asia. Little was done in the last five years to pursue less ambitious initiatives, such as improving the existing municipal transport systems in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, promoting cycle tracks and encouraging the use of non-polluting LPG, which is already available in the city.

Despite a series of recommendations made by the Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) to improve the traffic scenario, such as merging the Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) with the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT), the Congress and the BJP made little efforts towards this end.

Similarly,while CNG-powered vehicles are promised by both Rawat and Kalmadi, there is no evidence to show that these leaders or their respective parties undertook initiatives to promote the use of LPG.

Also, neither the BJP nor the Congress has nominated a transportation expert on the PMT committee that governs the transport bodyâ€™s functioning.

This, despite the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, recommending that traffic experts be appointed on municipal transport committees.

The two parties also made little efforts to promote cycle tracks in the city, which could have brought relief to a countless school-children and cyclists. Kalmadiâ€™s 1998 election manifesto had promised cycle tracks for Pune. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) even introduced a track at Wakdewadi on the Mumbai-Pune highway.However, that track now serves as a parking lot for vehicles.

Both the manifestos also promise beautification of the Mutha river. The track record of the last five years, however, has this to say: a river-beautification project drafted by the PMC has been awaiting approval from the Kalmadi-dominated PMC standing committee for the last three years.

Kalmadi, in his 1998 manifesto, had also promised a major afforestation drive along the hills in and around Pune. Five years down the line, the ruling Congress party, while recommending an amendment to the draft DP (Development Plan) for the 23 fringe villages, de-zoned over 200 hectares of hilltop/hill-slope land. Finally, it were the citizens who took to the streets to protest against the de-zoning. The process was then temporarily stayed and objections raised by the citizens are now being heard.

On its part, the city-unit of the BJP fiercely opposed the dezoning during the PMCâ€™s general body meetings and also mobilised a section of the citizenry against the move.

4,'Sugar lobby raising funds for election',"PUNE: The NCP-Congresscontrolled sugar lobby is not only artificially hiking sugar prices ahead of the general elections, it is also generating funds for the election in the process, with the connivance of big traders, Shiv Sena MLC Kanhaiyalal Gidwani has alleged.

They have been told to reject tenders with current market prices, he said. â€œOtherwise, they would not have been keen on exporting sugar when the international price is lower than the domestic price. Even the government would not have offered a subsidy of Rs 250 per quintal.â€�

Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the Maharashtra State Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories, has, however, denied the allegations. â€œSugar prices would have crashed after the announcement of the increased quota for April-June by the Union government. We also feared that traders would start hoarding sugar, so that factories decided to streamline the release system â€” by releasing a weekly quota not fortnightly,â€� he told TNN.

5,NCP-Cong. plays sugar politics,"PUNE: For the second time this year, the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) controlled sugar lobby has spiced up the election scenario in the state by engineering a hike in sugar price, by not releasing the sanctioned quota into the market.

In just six days, the sugar price has shot up by Rs 125 per quintal.

In Pune, the wholesale sugar price has gone up to Rs 1,450 per quintal from last weekâ€™s Rs 1,325 -Rs 1,350. In the retail market, it has gone up from Rs 13 per kg to Rs 15 per kg.

The sugar lobby had resorted to similar market manipulation in January-February, compelling the Union government to release additional quota to maintain price stability.

Highly-placed market sources told TNN on Sunday that by not releasing the sanctioned quota into the market, the mills were allowing the quota sanctioned by the Union government to lapse.

â€œPune needs 2,500 to 3,000 sugar bags every day, but only 500 bags are made available by sugar factories, resulting in a price hike,â€� sources revealed. They alleged that from the sanctioned quota for March, as many as 7 lakh bags were allowed to lapse in the state.

Sources alleged that sugar factories have formed a cartel to engineer an artificial scarcity in the market, despite the Union government sanctioning 52 lakh tonnes of sugar for April-June.

They fear that prices would touch Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,600 per quintal in the next six days. Shiv Sena MLC Kanhaiyalal Gidwani charged that as many as 75 sugar factories had not sold their quota for April. â€œThey have stopped selling sugar in the open market s on instructions from the Congress-NCP-dominated sugar lobby to create problems for the NDA.â€�

6,Best case: SC slams Modi govt,"NEW DELHI: Though the acquittal of the 21 accused in the Best Bakery case was upheld by the Gujarat High Court, which also raised questions about the intentions of groups campaigning for the accused to be tried afresh and transfer of the case, the Supreme Court on Monday upturned the verdict with a stinging indictment of the Modi government.

The order to transfer the trial outside Gujarat came with a sharp censure of the law and order situation in Gujarat: ""Keeping in view the peculiar circumstances of the case and the ample evidence on record, glaringly demonstrating subversion of justice delivery system with no congenial and conducive atmosphere still prevailing, we direct that retrial shall be done by a court under the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court.""

The Bench directed the state government to consult victims and witnesses before appointing advocates to represent them, and asked the Director General of Police to oversee the probe which is now to be conducted on a day-to-day basis.

Maintaining that free and fair trial of the case was not possible in Gujarat, the Bench criticised the Gujarat High Court for making ""irresponsible"" remarks against those seeking retrial â€” social activist Teesta Setalvad, key witness Zahira Sheikh and even against NHRC.

7,MLA denies allegations in youth's suicide note,"MUMBAI: In his five-page suicide note, Dharmesh Jariwala (26), who hanged himself from a ceiling fan at his Malad residence on Saturday, has blamed Borivli''s BJP MLA Hemendra Mehta and four others for the incident.

Speaking to some mediapersons on Sunday, Mehta denied the allegations. The suicide note was recovered by the police from the flat in Giridhar Park Marve road.

A senior police officer said, ""We will question Mehta and four others including a corporator whose name also appears in the note.""

Police sources said that Jariwala had shifted to Malad six months ago along with his mother and sister, Gayatri, who is a TV actress and worked in the serial Amanat.

They earlier stayed in Giriraj society in Borivli where they had a dispute with neighbours. Jariwala had lodged a complaint with Borivli police against N B Gohil, chairman of the society, for sexually abusing his sister some years ago.

Following this, Jariwala received threats over the phone and was also stabbed some months ago.

Police said that when Jariwala approached the local MLA, Mehta, for help, the latter allegedly demanded sexual favours from Gayatri. Mehta has denied the charge, stating that he wanted to settle the dispute between Jariwala and Gohil.

""I am willing to co-operate with the investigators as my name figures in the suicide note,"" Mehta said.

8,Garland trade withers as elections near,"HYDERABAD: More proof of how much the common man is affected by the forthcoming elections. Many people from the Old City have decided to postpone their weddings until after elections fearing trouble during poll time.

This has directly affected the flower and garland market as no weddings mean no flower sale.

Contrary to the popular belief that election time spells big business for flower and garland vendors as supporters will be queuing up to greet their leader with garlands, there has actually been a major dip in the sale of flowers this season.

Almost all of the 20 to 22 garland vendors of the Moazam Jahi market, the largest garland market in the twin cities, have hardly any business.

""People are afraid. Anything can happen during elections. All the celebration spirit will be lost if there are any disturbances. So, it is better to get married after the elections are over,"" said Md Shabeer, a flower merchant.

""They don''t get married and we don''t get business,"" he said. While some garland traders are actually making a profit from the sale of garlands to political parties, these are a very small percentage of people.

""Our sales have gone up by 20 per cent. Party workers come and buy bulk quantities of garlands to decorate their campaigning leader,"" said Md Khadeer, another flower merchant from the Moazam Jahi market.

The most popular are the medium size jasmine and rose garlands that each cost Rs 20 to Rs 30. But not all are this fortunate.

""The sales were good when when NTR was the chief minister or even during the Congress'' rule. These days no political party buys garlands,"" said Md Yaseen, another garland maker.

""We incur an expenditure of up to Rs 4,000 each day, but there is hardly even Rs 2,000 worth business. And it''s not like we can store the stocks. At the end of the day, all unsold flowers will have to be disposed of,"" he said.

What keeps them going is the knowledge of booming trade at the end of elections, when not only will the marriage season pick up, but the election results also will be announced - meaning it''s time for celebrations.

""That''s when there is maximum election-related sales. People buy bouquets and garlands in large numbers to congratulate their leader on his or her win,"" bouquet trader M T Afroze said. ""We have good business then,"" he added.

9,'Be aware of building rules',"HYDERABAD: The public''s lack of knowledge on how to get the nod for constructing residential buildings has turned out to be a blessing in disguise for a few corrupt municipal authorities, who are involved in according permissions for the same.

""If the citizens are well aware of all rules and regulations, it would be virtually impossible for officials to deny them permission. The citizen will not have to pay a single paise, even to the most corrupt officer,"" an MCH official said.

No prior sanction is required for the construction of individual residential house in plots up to 100 sq mts without raising more than 10 mts. It should not have more than ground plus two upper floors (without stilts).

The plot should be part of an approved layout or sub-division, allotted by or purchased from a public agency like housing board, housing corporation etc. It should be covered by pattas issued by revenue department.

The construction should be carried out strictly in accordance with the master plan, zoning regulations and building bylaws among others.

The owner should file with the local authority copies of drawing of the proposed building along with the necessary fee and attested copies of ownership documents and layout plan before undertaking the construction.

He should also state that he shall leave and surrender land for road widening. He should also state that he will not violate any rules or building by-laws and if does, the local authority would be at a liberty to remove such deviations without prior notice.

Such applications filed with the local authority shall be valid for a period of three years for completion of building and would be mandatory to file building completion certificate with the concerned authority.

Similarly, the construction of individual residential buildings in plots up 300 sq mts and height up 10 mts, (ground plus two floors without stilts) also requires no prior approval.

However, approvals must be secured from empanelled licensed personnel like qualified architects, engineers, and town planners.

The time limit for disposal of building applications for individual residential buildings is only 15 days and that for other buildings is 30 days.

If the authority fails to intimate the applicant, then the plan deemed to be approved and should be carried out only as per the building regulations.

10,"CPI(ML) flays MCC, PW decision to contest polls","KOLKATA: Flaying the naxalite outfits Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and the People''s War, active in western West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, for ''pursuing wrong paths'', the CPI(ML) on Monday said it would contest five Parliamentary and an Assembly seat covering four states in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.
