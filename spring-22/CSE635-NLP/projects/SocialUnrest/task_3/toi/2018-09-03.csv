0,Debate hots up on archaic military laws,"jalandhar: the findings of the parliamentary standing committee on defence have fuelled a debate among the retired army officers who are at present practising as lawyers, and other luminaries, about the very nature of the system of administrating justice in the indian army. most of them are of the view that the army act, 1950 is based on the army act, 1911 which, they argue, was enacted by the british to provide unbridled powers to army commanders to punish at will, thereby using the indian army as a tool to spread their influence over the whole country. they feel that the system of court martials was created not to deliver justice, but to carry out the wishes of british officers. the debate, which stemmed from a landmark supreme court judgment in the case lt col prithi pal singh versus union of india, is becoming hotter day by day, especially in the light of the recent cases pending in military courts, including those relating to the kargil conflict and the tehelka scam. this very judgment says: ""our army act was more or less modelled on the uk act. three decades of working with winds of change blowing over the world necessitates a second look so as to bring it in conformity with the liberty-oriented constitution and the rule of law which is the uniting and integrating force in our political society."" many of the retired army personnel who are today practising as lawyers and frequently taking up cases dealing with the army, are of the view that ""there are serious lacunae in the army act, and that is the reason why the number of army officers seeking the help of civil courts is on the rise and faith in the administration of justice in the army is being eroded"". according to lt col (retd) s k bhatia, practising as a lawyer dealing with military cases, says: ""even uk had enacted a court martial (appeals) act, 1951 and it had been extensively amended in the court martial (appeals) act, 1968. usa also corrected the deficiencies of their army act by enacting the military justice act, 1968."" pointing out the lacunae in army laws, lt col bhatia says: ""right from the beginning, the accused is put behind bars and is closely guarded. he knows that he is to be punished.the 'friend of the accused' provision is there, but when the accused is locked up how can he help him. all the judges of the general court martial (gcm) are under the influence of the convening authority. the gcm members have the authority to award even death penalty, but are laymen as far as the legal technicalities are concerned."" barinderjit singh shelley, an advocate, says: ""the universally accepted dictum is that 'justice must not only be done but must seem to be done'.the administration of justice in the army certainly needs overhauling to repose the confidence of the armed forces. it is because army personnel fail to get justice from the military judicial system that they knock at the doors of the civilian system. the indian army act needs amendment. the old one is redundant. provision for judicial review or appeal should be incorporated."" the historical reasons that compelled the creation of the 1911 act, on which the present army act is closely modelled, are spelled out clearly in the manual of military law vol 1.major mohinder singh, a veteran who has sat through a large number of gcms as a defending officer while in service, and as defence counsel in more than 300 court martials, says: ""the army act which was made in 1911 was applicable only to the indian troops. the summary court martial (scm) is peculiar to the indian army. no other army in the world, except in india and pakistan, has this practice. these courts were not introduced into the regular army till after the mutiny of a greater part of bengal in 1857. the discipline of the regular indian army had for sometime, before that catastrophe, seriously deteriorated and it was noticed that the irregular troops and more especially the punjab irregular force were in this respect in a much better state than their comrades of the regular army. ""after the suppression of the mutiny, the reason for the difference was sought and it was found to be largely due to the position of comparative insignificance occupied by the commandant of a regular regiment who had practically no power to punish or award his own men. in contrast to this, the commanding officer of a regiment of punjab's irregular force had almost absolute power in that regiment and could, under the system prevailing in the force, himself deal promptly and effectively with all military offenders.... with this object summary court martials (scms) were at first introduced tentatively and were, in 1869, definitely established as part of the legal machinery of india.the scms are still part of military law in a free and democratic india,"" says major mohinder singh. ""the scm comprises a one-man court that acts as judge, prosecutor and witness in the trial. there can be a friend of the accused to defend him, but he has no right of audience.there is no appeal against the judgment. the judgment does not have to be put in written.the system of trial by court martial does not inspire confidence of the accused, as mostly the members of the court martial are under the command influence of the convening authority,"" he says.

1,"Morcha, Cong lambast Badal govt","chandigarh: the panthic morcha and the congress organised separate rallies, at chhapar fair, in ludhiana, on sunday, and lambasted the ruling sad-bjp combine for non-performance. the panthic morcha rally was lacklustre in the absence of former sgpc president gurcharan singh tohra, though the presence of two former akal takht jathedars, ranjit singh and jasbir singh rode, partly compensated. panthic morcha leaders hit at punjab chief minister parkash singh badal, accusing him of ''violating all the panthic conventions and traditions and demolishing the sikh institutions by his autocratic style of functioning and thrusting his own men in the party, sgpc and sikh institutions. for the congress, it was another opportunity to display that the party was united under the leadership of its state chief,amarinder singh. congress leaders hit at the panthic morcha and ruling sad-bjp combine. having a dig at badal, congress leaders described the ''sangat darshan'' of the chief minister as ''a fraud''. most of the speakers held the view that development had suffered during the five years of sadbjp rule, and towards the fag end of the term, badal was busy enacting the drama of 'sangat darshan'. they pointed out that the cheques issued at ''sangat darshans'' were not honoured by officials, and how the visitors to such functions were screened.

2,"Samata to contest elections in Punjab, says Krishna Rao","hoshiarpur: a proposal which could give a new twist to the akali-bjp combine vis-a-vis the assembly elections in punjab, the key nda constituent samata party, on sunday, said the party would contest the polls and also negotiate with the akali-bharatiya janata party leadership for seat adjustments. ""the final decision on the number of seats and candidates will be finalised only after consultations with all concerned authorities,"" president of samata party v v krishna rao told mediapersons here, on sunday. rao supported the demand of chief ministers of the states of punjab, haryana and andhra pradesh for raising the procurement price of paddy from rs 520 per quintal to rs 550 per quintal. referring to the tehelka expose, in the wake of which he had replaced jaya jaitly as the party chief,v v krishna rao said the motive of the portal investigation was solely to break the national democratic allaince and topple the vajpayee-led coalition government. he charged tehelka editor-in-chief tarun tejpal of ""spoiling the name of journalism"" by resorting to unethical use of prostitutes in the operation."" rao, however, said samata party will not file any defamation case against the editor of the portal. he said that the samata party units will be soon set up in himachal pradesh, goa and tripura.

4,Left partner asks govt to look into power cuts,"kolkata: aggravated by intermittent power cuts in large parts of the city as well as in howrah, hooghly and north 24-parganas, the cpi has demanded the immediate intervention of the state government in the matter. in a statement issued on saturday, cpi state secretary manju majumdar said the state government should take effective measures to ensure smooth power supply in the affected areas. the cesc recently reduced the supply of power to its command area after the west bengal state electricity board curtailed its supply to the cesc by 100 mw. the seb had explained that it had been forced to take the hard decision following the cesc's failure to clear its dues to the tune of rs 1,050 crore. the cpi and the rsp, two major partners of the ruling left front, had earlier hauled up state power minister mrinal banerjee saying that his department had gone against the front's policy to help private players in the power sector. banerjee had been summoned to the meeting of the left front committee last month to reply to the charges of the two front partners. even as banerjee explained the state power department's policy, he was asked to give his reply in writing to all the nine front constituents. significantly, the seb decision to curb supply of power to the cesc followed the cpi and the rsp's scathing attack against the power minister.

5,Insecurity grips senior ministers in state,"hyderabad: fear and a sense of insecurity have gripped the ministers over the future of the government, in the light of reverses in the local body elections. senior ministers in the government who have close proximity with chief minister n chandrababu naidu, have conveyed their sentiments to him during the meetings held to assess the lapses in the government and administration, recently. ministers who have long administrative experience say that naidu should undertake a serious exercise in self-introspection at government and personal levels, undo the damage done to the government, and rectify the drawbacks in the administration at the earliest. ""if we go to the elections today, the party will be routed completely, please believe me,"" a senior minister told the times of india. naidu had already begun an exercise to set right things in the government and administration. but the ministers appear skeptical. a cabinet sub-committee is looking into the government schemes and programmes to identify the shortcomings and suggest ways to make them people-friendly. however, the ministers blame naidu for the present state of affairs. they say that naidu had centralised the powers and reduced the ministers to non-entities, and in the process, giving an upper hand to the bureaucracy. ""he directly talks to the officers and they do not obey our orders. what can we do?"" a senior minister remarked. as a result, the administrative system and command control structure have collapsed in the government. the ministers and senior government officials have virtually lost control over the juniors, leading to disenchantment among the ministers. ""too much of personal interaction between naidu and officials is not advisable. it is good that he should have cordial relations with them, but we are becoming a casualty in the process, and they do not care for us"", observed another minister. the programmes initiated by the government with fanfare and publicity did not yield results at the ground level as naidu went on switching over to different programmes without establishing the mechanism at the grassroot level to carry on the existing ones. ironically, all the major government programmes have failed to produce the desired results. the ministers also say that the government should have pro-poor moorings, and time and again have been requesting naidu to stop openly meeting and spending time with big industrialists and information technology bigwigs. they feel that the government should relaunch all the programmes with a poor man's perspective and mind. the distance between naidu and party cadres has grown beyond imagination in recent years, and the lower level leaders are not prepared to believe the government.

6,Cong raps govt for failing to aid drought-hit ryots,"hyderabad: senior leader g muddukrishnama naidu on sunday criticised the state government's failure to secure central assistance for drought relief in spite of revenue minister p ashok gajapathi raju meeting prime minister vajpayee in july and apprising him of the severe drought in the state. chief minister n chandrababu naidu also met the pm twice, and a central team toured the droughtaffected areas in the state, but the centre has ignored the state's pleas for assistance, he said. he demanded that the centre immediately release rs 850 crore for the drought relief scheme proposed by the state government. he appealed to the government to write off farmers' loans in the drought-affected areas. he added that in spite of the government promising rs 6,000 crore fresh loans to farmers, not even rs 500 crore were dispensed so far. naidu wanted the government to supply seeds and fertilisers free of cost to the farmers. he observed that ""our state which is the leading milk producer in the country was falling behind, as the farmers were selling their cattle to slaughter houses, unable to feed them."" he wanted the government to give fodder free of cost to the farmers. reeling out statistics showing decrease of rainfall in the state, naidu said that there was an average decrease of 40 per cent in rainfall as compared to last year. he alleged that insurance companies had collected premium for crop insurance from the farmers, but insurance was not paid to the affected farmers. many parts of the state were suffering from acute drinking water scarcity and many borewells had dried up. he said the government should immediately see that more wells are dug. he alleged that the government was harassing contractors who had completed the municipal works, by not paying their bills. he wanted the government to supply at least nine hours of electricity to the agriculture sector, if not the 12 hours promised by it.

8,"Reshuffle based on ministers performance, says Vajpayee","new delhi: immediately after the re-shuffle-expansion of his ministry, which saw six new faces in the ministry, the prime minister told journalists that the message of the exercise he had undertaken was:""i wanted to fill up some vacancies, make some changes based on the performance of my ministers, and give an opportunity to the new generation."" but the most key vacancy, defence, which external affairs minister jaswant singh is holding, is still awaiting the return of george fernandes. the pm also said that the next phase, induction from non-bjp nda parties would not be for a while and that he would do it only after consulting his allies: ""there will be no expansion now, for sometime,"" he stressed. the six new faces were those of two cabinet minis-ters, ved prakash goel and karia munda, and four ministers of state, ravi shankar prasad, rajiv pratap rudy, annasaheb patil and vijay goel; the seventh, ashok pradhan, who was to have been sworn in as a minister of state could not attend the swearing in cer-emony as he has gone to durban to attend the un conference on racism. two ministers of state were ele-vated, arun shourie and syed shahnawaz hussain, and four ministers of state have been dropped, chaoba singh, shriram chauhan, debendra pradhan and jaisingh rao gaekwad patil. the two winners of the evening were pramod mahajan, who in addition to parliamentary affairs and it, got the plum communications, and mr hussain, who did not just get a promotion but moved to civil aviation: as minister of state for food processing, the latter presided over the disinvestment of modern foods; as civil aviation minister now, the disinvest-ment of air india is expected to go through smoothly. on saturday evening, after the many tense moments they went through, the ministers' faces told their tales; yashwant sinha came in, beaming, m.venkaiah naidu looked visibly relieved that he was still in government and not back at the bjp head-quarters, while arun jaitley, who has lost shipping, looked somewhat sombre, indeed, he had to cancel a trip to malaysia where he was headed on friday to sign some shipping contracts. of the three ministers who have been given new jobs, apparently not to their liking, sharad yadav arrived, looking grim and left with his arms around the shoulder of fellow yadav, hukumdeo narayan yadav, ramvilas paswan came so late that the security almost stopped him at the gate and maneka gandhi did not show up. another cabinet minister told journalists: ""in addition to the lists of fresh induction and those who've been dropped, you should add the names of the survivors and those who narrowly escaped."" home minister l.k. advani is clearly more than pulling his weight in the government, as soon as he walked in, all those who were to be sworn in rose to their feet and came up to greet him. he is believed to have played a major role in saving jobs, new portfolios and fresh induction, the real hand behind the tiller.

9,Rajnath not to make Ayodhya an election issue,"new delhi:uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh has said he will not make ayodhya a plank for the state assembly elections. talking informally to reporters here on sunday, mr singh said he was determined not to raise the temple controversy for the purpose winning elections. ""i said this before and i repeat now that we have no intentions to make ayodhya a poll issue,"" mr singh said. referring to prime minister vajpayee's recent statement, he affirmed that talks were indeed on with the concerned groups to find a solution to the ram janmabhumi tangle. the cm made it clear that he was not involved in the negotiations and that the dialogue was on another level in delhi. he said the bjp would seek a verdict from the people on the basis of the work done by his government. mr singh denied there was any further move to drop 'tainted' ministers from his team. asked about the possible repercussions of perceived demotions of sharad yadav and ramvilas paswan in u.p., the cm said there would be no impact of saturday's union cabinet reshuffle on state politics. ""i am in touch with both of them and they will campaign for us,"" mr singh said. despite his denial of any political motive behind the recent announcement for a special quota for the most marginalised among the backwards and sc/sts, mr singh made no bones about its likely political impact. ""about 55 per cent of the population in u.p. will benefit,"" he said. a large section of muslims, he claimed, will also be covered by the quota for the most backward classes. he said that an electoral tieup with union agriculture minister ajit singh's rashtriya lok dal would boost the prospects of the alliance in the coming elections.

10,Emotion rules over reason for Sena,"mumbai: whether or not the shiv sena's version of the events that unfolded at singhania hospital last sunday will wash with thane's electorate will only be known at the next civic elections. however, this is not the first time that the 35-year-old party has attributed violence by its cadres to an ""emotional outpouring"". neither is this the first time that the party has resorted to such tactics. when ghulam ali sang in mumbai, the show was disrupted. when fire was screened here, the cinema hall was stoned. whenever the indian cricket authorities want test matches with pakistan, sainiks have dug up pitches and ransacked the cricket board's office. if schools deny admission to locals, their prin-cipals are roughed up. not only is the violence resorted to by the rank and file, even elect-ed representatives of the party have not been above such tactics. last year, 13 sena mlas were sus-pended for six months after they ran amuck in the state assembly, smashing furniture and tearing up law books. this was their way of responding to the proposal by deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal that mr thackeray be arrested for his writings in the sena mouthpiece saamna during the 1992-'93 riots. again, last year, sena women corporators, led by former mayor vishakha raut, tried to strip waqarunnisa ansari of the samajwadi party in the briha mumbai municipal corporation hall during a debate in which ms ansari had made a disparaging remark about the sena chief. ironically, for a party whose avowed aim is to ""develop a strong, upright and cultured youth, aware of responsibilities and duties towards the motherland and society,"" vio-lence has never been triggered by bread and butter issues. instead, says bohra reformist and campaigner for secularism asghar ali engineer, the party has capitalised on topical and emotive issues.

11,Rupee rules rock-steady against $,"mumbai: the rupee ruled rock-steady against the u s currency on monday in extremely thin and listless dealings at the interbank foreign exchange market in the absence of fresh leads. opening around rs 47.13/14 per dollar, the rupee was wedged in a narrow groove of rs 47.13 and rs 47.14, before closing around rs 47.1350/1400, unchanged from last friday's levels. rupee-dollar outright spot transactions remained quiet and within tight bands due to lack of market-moving factors. a labour day holiday in new york also aided the subdued activity. light dollar supplies accumulated over the weekend gave the rupee slight underlying support, but was mopped up by steady demand from public sector banks, dealers said. ""the rupee has been quietly steady in a 2-5 paise band for the past one-month due to lack of clear market direction and waning interest in the spot trade. it should continue this trend in the current week also unless some important local or international factor emerges to move the exchange rate significantly,"" a dealer said. the reserve bank of india fixed the reference rate at rs 47.13 per dollar, as against rs 47.15 on the last working day on august 31. the reference rate is based on 12-noon rates of a few select banks in mumbai. the sdr-rupee rate is calculated on this rate. marketmen expect the rupee to trade in a range of rs 47.12 and rs 47.15 on tuesday. in cross currency trades, the rupee staged a smart rally against euro and recovered moderate ground against the british sterling. resuming on a distinctly firm note against the single european currency at rs 42.84/86 per euro from last friday's finish of rs 43.23/25, the rupee firmed up further at the close to rs 42.78/80 per euro. the indian unit ended higher against sterling at rs 68.62/64 per pound from rs 68.83/85 after opening better at rs 68.46/49 per pound. the futures market was also dull and forward dollar premiums declined due to renewed receiving interest on the back of comfortable liquidity at the domestic money market. call rates hovered in a range of 6.80-7.00 per cent at the overnight call money market following ample liquidity in the banking system. the benchmark six-months forward dollar premiums payable at the end of february closed at 104-1/2-103-1/2 paise, lower from last friday's closing levels of 106-104 paise.

12,'Bush govt for transformed Indo-US relationship',"new delhi: the newly appointed us ambassador to india, robert blackwill outlined the importance that the bush administration places on indo-us relationship, while delivering his maiden speech in india. us president george bush, the ambassador said, wishes to develop a transformed relationship with democratic india. us is seeking to intensify collaboration with india on a whole range of issues that currently confront the global community, he added. ""in short, president bush has a global approach to us-india relations, consistent with the rise of india as a world power,"" he noted. speaking at a conference organised by the confederation of indian industry, blackwill said that the us president does not only intend to accelerate cooperation with india on purely bilateral terms, but also wants the administration to engage more actively with the indian government and its people. speaking on free markets, he said: ""open trade has more than material benefits. unimpeded commerce between nations promotes freedom."" without directly naming china or pakistan, he said: ""those regimes that now imagine that they can increasingly open up their economies to the world, and at the same time maintain their autocratic grip on their people, are engaged in a losing struggle."" ""among other things, the information technology revolution will speed their downfall. that is because citizens who gained freedom to choose in the marketplace will eventually want the same freedom in the political arena,"" he said. blackwill also noted that asia continued to contain a dangerous legacy from the cold war and added, ""it is also home to the continuing tensions between china and taiwan, and between india and pakistan, he said.

13,Agri minister opposes palm oils import duty cuts,"new delhi: strongly opposing any cut in import duty on palm oil, union agriculture minister, ajit singh, said on monday it should rather be increased keeping the interests of the farmers in mind. ""with burgeoning imports of palm oil and mounting import bill, imports of the commodity needs to be curbed and the domestic production encouraged,"" he said. he said when kharif crop of oilseeds was being harvested any move to reduce duty on palm oil would be a retrograde step and work against farmers' interests. any surge in imports on account of reduction in duty would also depress the prices which could have long-term implications for india's crop pattern. ""if the farmers do not get remunerative prices for their produce, they would be discouraged from producing oilseeds and shift to other crops,"" he added. at a time when there is a need to bring more and more land under oilseeds so that india became self sufficient in edible oils, a cut in duty would result in the opposite. duty, in fact, should be increased on palm oils as it was much below the wto-bound rates level, he added. there has been a consistent demand by the vanaspati industry to bring down the duty on crude palm oil the main raw material for them. malaysia has also been demanding a duty cut saying palm oils were placed at a disadvantage vis-a-vis soya oil on which the duty was 45 per cent compared to 85 per cent on rbd palmolein oil and 75 per cent on crude palm oil.

14,Orissa govt blamed for starvation deaths,"bhubaneswar: president of orissa unit of janata dal (secular) ashok das, mla, on monday blamed the state government for the recent spate of deaths in kashipur block of rayagada district. ""though there has been raging debate as to whether these deaths were actually due to starvation or food poisoning, there is no doubt that the incidents are related to food scarcity in the area,"" das said in a statement here. ""it is high time that the naveen patnaik government owns responsibility for its failure to protect the lives of the people. the government is in the dock and its ability to govern is under test,"" the jd (s) leader said. stating that the tribals of the block had been taking mango kernel not out of fancy, das said that the tribals had switched to mango kernel out of compulsion as they did not get staple food like rice and ragi. ""they had no choice,"" he said. on recent comments by orissa chief secretary that mango kernel was a staple food and the tribals were in the habit of eating it, as reported in press, the jd (s) leader claimed that mango kernel was cattle food. ""if people are eating cattle food 54 years after independence, who else other than the government will be blamed,"" he maintained. das demanded to know what happened to the rs 100 crore spent in kbk districts (undivided districts of kalahandi, bolangir and koraput) and particularly in kashipur block where rs 60 crore were spent in last 10 years under the orissa tribal development project funded by international fund for agricultural development (ifad).

15,Bureaucrat takes on Education minister,"thiruvananthapuram: kerala education minister nalakath soopy is in the midst of a raging controversy, kicked up by a senior ias official of his own department over what is described as the ''entrance scam''. the first major controversy of the four-month-old antony government surfaced when firebrand bureaucrat alphons kannanthanam came out openly against soopy in the wake of his request before the cabinet to shift the official from the post of commissioner of entrance examinations and secretary, higher education, and post him as commissioner, land use board. with the august 22 cabinet meeting promptly obliging soopy, kannanthanam minced no words to express his anger and went to the extent of alleging that he was being shunted in reply to his ''firm no'' to the minister's directive to tamper with the entrance rank list for the sake of accommodating a candidate of his choice from malabar for the mbbs course. kannanthanam, who worked as secretary to ram jethmalani when he was a cabinet minister in the vajpayee government, also threatened to burst a high explosive ''bomb'' against the minister. ''i am ready to hand over this bomb to the chief minister along with supporting documents. but the chief minister should make a demand for the same. i will not show this bomb to anybody else'' he said. in fact, kannanthanam had flaunted a file containing the alleged bomb to some newspersons who visited his chamber, but refused to allow them to have a glimpse. soopy, a leader of the indian union muslim league, did not react to his allegations and just said ''this is blackmailing''. he told newspersons that he was not afraid of anything. ''let the chief minister decide. i have explained everything to the party leadership''. chief minister a k antony has so far not broken his silence over the issue. however, he told newspersons at kochi on monday that he would open his mouth only on wednesday after the meeting of the council of ministers. it is not known if the transfer of kannanthanam had anything to do with the leakage of cabinet notes relating to granting minority status to some of the newly sanctioned self-financing engineering colleges. the pro-left students federation of india and the all india student federation had wanted antony to sack soopy for ''exercising pressure on the entrance commissioner to commit an irregularity in this year's entrance rank list''. however, the sree narayana dharma paripalana (sndp) yogam has come to the rescue of the beleaguered minister with its leaders demanding action against kannanthanam for allegedly trying to blackmail the minister.

16,"Despite govt claim, it's still mango kernels","bhubaneswar: has rice actually started reaching the hungry tribals of kashipur block in rayagada district? if the orissa government is to be believed, everything is fine there. but the special relief commissioner (src) says that nothing has changed. the people still have no option but to continue eating mango kernels and wild roots. the foodgrain component under the food-for-work programme has not reached the block. the antyodaya scheme (under which a beneficiary can buy 25 kg of rice per month at a rate of rs 3 per kg) has not started in the district, the src, hrushikesh panda, has observed in his report. the src had rushed to kashipur block following a nationwide outcry over hungry and jobless tribals in villages eating mango kernels and wild roots and dying. he submitted his report to the government on saturday. in the last few weeks alone, 20 tribals have died in the block after they consumed a paste made out of mango kernels. this seems to be continuing with reports of more deaths of tribals coming in from the area. main findings of the src's report: * the benefits of most welfare schemes are going to vested interests instead of the common villagers. in many cases, the works cannot start because of quarrels between contractors. there are several instances of misappropriation in works done under the calamity relief fund (crf) and the food-for-work (ffw) programme in the last season. * in panasguda village, which accounted for seven deaths, people had mortgaged their below poverty line (bpl) ration cards with a local moneylender named dada sabat. the commissioner ordered the tehsildar to immediately raid the moneylender's house, from where bpl rice was seized. * rice is not reaching the tribals, forcing them to eat all kinds of inedible stuff and court death. instead of being lifted by villagers, rice is bought by moneylenders with whom the bpl cards are lying mortgaged. * the report also casts shadow on the state government's claims that the food-for-work (ffw) programme had been going on in the area since april and that works had been intensified after the recent deaths. at least rs 15 lakh had been sanctioned under the ffw, the government claimed. * other problems which are being neglected and which are contributing to the people's hunger include land reforms, usurious moneylending, mortgage of crops, bondage and illegal alienation of tribal land.

17,Tunga farmers gherao Dharam Singh,"raichur: the tail-end farmers of tungabhadra left bank canal on monday gheraoed district incharge and pwd minister dharam singh, who was on his way to lingasugur to inspect and review drought relief works. a group of more than 200 farmers obstructed the minister's car near the seventh milecross and gheraoed him. they said the water gauge in the main distributary and its sub-distributaries of the tungabhadra left bank canal was not being maintained. the farmers complained against the officials of the irrigation department for their failure, due to which water supply to their fields has dried up. this despite the authorities having released tungabhadra water on july 26 in the main left bank canal. the farmers were led by g basawaraj reddy and kalmala sharanappa of the janata dal (united). dharam singh assured the farmers he would look into the issue and set it right. the minister later visited kotikal and karadkal villages and lingasugur town where drought relief works are going on. nearly 400 labourers are engaged in desilting the kotikal water tank. singh proceeded to karadkal village and inspected the road laying work under the drought relief programme. the road has reached a length of 2.2 km and will link karadkal village main road to karadkal tanda, where there are no basic facilities. karadkal is a village in the back of beyond, where no inroads have been made. the people of karadkal tanda said they have no drinking water. the panchayat has provided only one borewell, which is out of order. the ill and diseased have to be carried manually to lingasugur town for treatment. since there are no roads, the villagers tread through fields to reach the main road. this godforsaken place has a population of around 400. dharam singh, who heard out the woes of these people, instructed the officials of the zilla panchayat engineering section to drill another two borewells in karadkal tanda. he also inspected the permanent drinking water supply project under construction at lingasugur town, which has a population of around 28,000. this project is estimated to cost rs 16 crore and has a storage capacity of 0.35 tmcft in the proposed reservoir. more than 400 labourers are engaged in building the reservoir. he later visited rampur near lingasugur, where roads are being laid.

18,"Caste decides, but does not rule in Sabarkantha","ahmedabad: if one were to go by the difference in reception sabarkantha gave to bjp candidate upendra trivedi and congress candidate madhusudan mistry at himmatnagar when they went to file their nominations, one could bet on who might win. but the sabarkantha parliamentary constituency has the reputation of throwing up surprises. it has elected candidate gulzarilal nanda thrice and given the country a prime minister. then there has been h m patel, arvind 'ravana' trivedi of ramayan fame and nishaben chaudhary. patel and chaudhary have been elected twice from sabarkantha. but the irony is that of the 11.5 lakh voters in sabarkantha, at least 35 per cent are tribals, followed by the chaudhary-patels who comprise 20 per cent of the votebank. the other decisive votes are those of scheduled castes and muslims who comprise roughly 10 per cent each of the consituency. in this many-hued constituency, nishaben chaudhary was the only candidate who was a tribal and was elected from here twice by a huge margin. upendra trivedi is arvind's younger brother, and having won as an independent candidate from the bhiloda assembly constituency, he could very well take over the parliamentary constituency, except that the district panchayat here is dominated by the congress. unfortunately for trivedi, when he went to file his nomination on saturday, he was met by the striking school teachers who reportedly gheraoed him and told him of their demands. the mood naturally turned sour till some senior bjp leaders intervened to end the scuffle. contrarily, first-timer mistry was flanked by three former chief ministers amarsinh chaudhary, shankersinh vaghela and dilip parikh, besides urmila patel and raju parmar when he went to file his nomination papers on monday. but these things have never determined the political fate of sabarkantha. it has been the adivasis, the chaudhary-patels, the muslims _ and this time the voter turn-out and electronic voting machines (evms) _ which will determine it. ""a majority of the people here don't know how to use evms, and there is not much time to train them. so there is scope for manipulation,"" observes a political functionary. the contest is between the congress and the bjp, but the other candidates in fray are ramesh nanjibhai bhambhi from the bahujan samaj party who is a scheduled caste candidate and has contested earlier, and ramesh dharmabhai patel from the samajwadi party. of the assembly constituencies in sabarkantha ls seat, vadgam, danta, khedbrahma and bhiloda were in the favour of the congress in the 1998 elections, while idar and himmatnagar and modasa went in favour of the bjp candidate kanubhai patel. both parties have their fingers crossed this time, since even an outsider like nanda and nris have been sent to parliament by sabarkantha. so, no one's betting as yet.

20,CERC warns govt on genetically modified foods,"ahmedabad: the consumer education and research centre (cerc), ahmedabad, in a memorandum has called upon the union agriculture ministry not to allow unrestricted import of food items without proper health and quality checks at entry points. also, it advised consumers not to buy any imported foods unless they conformed to indian food standards and also carried a ""gm free"" label. ""without giving much attention to systems needed to ensure quality, like testing for communicable diseases, checking for proper labelling, the government is hastily allowing these imports,"" cerc stated in the memorandum, and warned that considering the prevalence of mad-cow disease in europe, the issue was more serious than realised and important. it stated that the government was first allowing a whole lot of meat items under the free trade list and then making sanitary permit mandatory. at the same time, fish and other seafood products were being exempted from such a permit. ""one doesn't understand the logic behind the exemption, since fish and other seafood may be contaminated with mercury and other pollutants,"" it stated. cerc also referred to the issue of genetically modified (gm) imported food items and their safety. gm technology allows shifting of genes from totally unrelated species to bring about characteristics like increased yield, taste, pest-resistance, etc. cerc stated that in a clear violation of the provisions of the prevention of food adulteration act (pfa), many imported packaged foods were being allowed to sell without giving the consumer full information. some product labels are not even in english, let alone indian languages. greenpeace india has tested isomil baby food and pringles' potato chips and has found them positive for genetically engineered ingredients. as isomil is meant for infants, the manufacturers _ abbott laboratories _ should have labelled its gm-status. procter and gamble of japan has recalled 8,00,000 units of pringles' chips, largely consumed by children, after it has been discovered that they contain unapproved genetically modified potatoes. pringles is imported into india and sold without any label regarding its gm status. cerc called upon the government to see that gm food products without proper label were not allowed to be sold in the country. ""these foods are in the market because of our lax regulations"", it added.
