0,Near total response to traders' bandh,"PUNE: The bandh call given by the Federation of Trade Associations, Pune, on Thursday to protest against the introduction of value-added tax in the state, evoked a good response.

Most wholesalers, cloth merchants, electronic goods shops, jewellers and grocers in the city downed shutters for the day. A delegation of traders met district collector Madhukar Kokate in the morning to submit a memorandum, opposing immediate implementation of VAT.

Mohan Oswal, president, Poona Merchants Chamber told TNN on Thursday that there was great confusion among traders over VAT as the precise rules had not been made available.

â€œOfficers are still being trained and we fear there will be harassment due to differences in interpretation,â€� he explained. Oswal said tradersâ€™ representatives will meet in the city in the next couple of days to chalk out a line of action to oppose implementation of VAT.

Among the tradersâ€™ demands is the abolition of all other taxes before VAT is enforced, the chamber president said. They have also called for the simultaneous implementation of VAT all over the country, while calling for the exclusion of all essential commodities from its purview.

The traders have also objected to certain provisions which they felt would lead to harassment. Meanwhile, Market Yard, Laxmi road, Bhavani Peth and other commercial districts of the city wore a deserted look during the bandh. Some grocery and general stores, however, conducted business as usual.

1,"State BJP, Sena leaders keep off Modi's Shivneri rally","JUNNAR: Differences within the Hindutva forces, particularly between the BJP and the RSS, came to the fore on Thursday as senior BJP and Shiv Sena leaders and party cadres stayed away from Shiv Jayanti celebrations at the Shivneri fort in Junnar taluka, where Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi was the chief guest.

The function was organised by the Shivneri Smarak Samiti (SSS), a Sangh Parivar organisation. While Modi was present for the function, the Thackeray cousins â€” Uddhav and Raj â€” were conspicuous by their absence, along with senior state-level BJP leaders such as national vice-president Gopinath Munde, state president Pandurang Phundkar, state general-secretary Sharad Kulkarni and party spokesperson Prakash Jawadekar among others.

Those who attended the function were MP Pradeep Rawat, city BJP president and corporator Anil Shirole and four other corporators. The function had already generated heat within the BJP, which had expressed its displeasure with the Shivneri Smarak Samiti for inviting Modi as the chief guest. Modi was also scheduled to address public meetings in Pune and Aurangabad.

However, these were cancelled by the state BJP, apparently at the instance of the partyâ€™s national general-secretary, Pramod Mahajan. The party functionaries attributed Mundeâ€™s absence to the state assembly being in session and the presentation of the state budget.

Party sources said even the Rawat and Shirole would have avoided the function, but for appeals by a state unit general-secretary to ensure a face-saving presence of the party at the Gujarat chief ministerâ€™s function. The Sena on its part was upset with the samiti as it had turned down local Sena MLA Balasaheb Dangatâ€™s request to perform a pooja of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharajâ€™s statue at the fort and a public rally of Modi and Sena leaders in Junnar town.

Hurt at being sidelined in the event, local Sena leaders requested senior leaders to stay away from the function. Consequently, party cadres also stayed away, resulting in poor attendance at Modiâ€™s rally at the fort. Speaking at a public rally on the occasion, Modi praised Shivajiâ€™s foresight in establishing a navy despite waging a majority of his battles on land. â€œShivaji was among the first to recognise the threat from the British and French,â€� he said.

2,22 hurt in anti-war protests,"KOLKATA: Twenty-two protestors and two Kolkata Police constables were injured as anti-war activists of the SUCI and SFI, who staged separate demonstrations before the American Center, clashed with lathi-wielding police on Thursday.

Two other demonstrations by radical groups organised under the Committee Against War on Iraq and Iraq Juddha Birodhi Prachar Abhijan, however,went off peacefully although they blocked roads for some time.

About 800 SFI members broke through the police cordon, pelted stones and broke window panes of the American Center. Two constables and at least five students were injured when police tried to chase them away.

Earlier, around 150 SUCI supporters burnt an effigy of the US President and faced the wrath of the police. Seventeen of them were injured.

Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, along with 140 councillors, marched to the American Center and handed a memorandum against the war to the chief securitycum-liaison officer.

The Left Front and 11 other parties will organise a procession from Rani Rashmoni Road to the American Center on Friday. Another rally is planned by these parties on March 30. The Front called an emergency meeting during the day in which 19 parties including the SUCI, CPI(ML), CRLI, RJD and the Workersâ€™ Party decided to step up anti-war campaign in the state. CPM state secretary Anil Biswas criticised the Centre for taking a middle-path and said that the Vajpayee government should come out openly against the US aggression.

The politburo of the CPI(ML) Peoplesâ€™ War issued a statement from Patna urging the people to boycott all US-made goods and to resist the Centreâ€™s attempts to help the US in its war efforts.

3,YSR alleges witchhunt by govt,"HYDERABAD: Congress legislature party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Thursday demanded the chief minister to institute a probe by a sitting Supreme Court judge to enquire into the allegations made against him and his family members by the ruling Telugu Desam Party leaders.

In a strongly worded letter handed to Chandrababu Naidu in his chambers in the Assembly, Rajasekhara Reddy also demanded the government to nationalise all the mini-hydel projects and offered to hand over the one being run by his son.

The Congress leader accused the government of diverting important Assembly proceedings by harping on his sonâ€™s alleged involvement in a suitcase bomb case and besides his role in communal riots in Hyderabad during the year 1990.

â€œA judicial commission, which probed the Hyderabad riots, has clearly stated that neither me nor any of the Congress party members were involved in the riots. But the treasury benches time and again link my name to the riots,â€� Rajasekhara Reddy said.

â€œThe police tried to link my son, Jaganmohan, with a suitcase bomb case exactly two years ago, and is yet to prove him guilty in the case,â€� the CLP leader said pointing out that the government should better order a judicial probe to unravel the truth in the allegations.

He also observed that successive TDP governments slapped 28 criminal cases against him, but have not proved a single case so far. He also pointed out that the chief minister deliberately withheld a file pertaining to his house in Banjara Hills and cleared it under unavoidable circumstances.

â€œThe TDP is pursuing a single-point agenda â€” defame Rajasekhara Reddy and thereby divert the attention of the public on important issues like drought, water and power shortage,â€� he said.

The CLP leader said his son was selling power to Transco at a fixed price of Rs 3.30 per unit, and over 100 companies also doing the same.

â€œIf the chief minister thinks that the hydel power units are eating the government revenues, then let him nationalise the companies.â€�

4,Holi violence: Home Dept differs with CM?,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawati expressed concern at the incidents of violence during Holi which claimed six lives in the state and left several injured. But someone seems to disagree with the Madam as the state home department, in a separate release, expressed happiness that Holi passed off peacefully albeit some incidents.

A release, issued to the press by the state government on Thursday, stated that the CM had â€œtaken a serious note of Holi incidentsâ€� and went on to add that â€œno laxity will be tolerated on sensitive occasionsâ€� as subheads. The press communique quoted the CM as saying that while taking oath of office, she had promised to provide a fearless atmosphere to people by putting an effective check on the crime.

It was further stated that all the police officials, irrespective of their posts, would be responsible for maintaining the law and order in the state and if a major incident occurred the responsibility would be fixed at all the levels. The CM was also quoted as saying that owing to this policy she had transferred the then DGP of Lucknow, the IG zone and the DIG range in July last year holding them responsible for crime incidents that had taken place in the state capital. Thursdayâ€™s transfers were a sequel to it, the release added.

However, another release, issued to the press by principal secretary, home, Pradeep Kumar on Thursday, stated that barring stray incidents of violence, Holi passed off peacefully in the state. The press release header read: â€œOwing to effective and alert response of administration, Holi passes off peacefullyâ€�. The principal secretary was also quoted as saying that incidents of violence as published in newspapers were highly exaggerated and only six persons died during Holi in the state.

As both the releases were issued by the government, there remained no possibility of a goof up. So the bottom line remains: Either the principal secretary, home, does not agree with the CMâ€™s views or it was the other way round.

11,GoM meet soon to formalise opening of foreign investment,"NEW DELHI: The group of ministers on foreign investment policy headed finance minister Jaswant Singh will meet shortly to formally recommend enhancement of sectoral foreign equity holding limit as part of the budget.

The GoM was scheduled to meet on Friday, but the meeting was postponed because four out of six ministers in the group were out of Delhi.

Commerce and industry minister Arun Jaitley was campaigning for the BJP in Himachal Pradesh assembly pol; external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha was in Moscow, power minister Anant Geete was on a visit to the Talcher thermal power plant in Orissa and small industries minister C P Thakur was in Patna. That only left the FM and telecom and disinvestment minister Arun Shourie in the Capital.

As reported in The Times of India on Friday, the forthcoming budget will contain major initiatives for attracting foreign direct investment. The policy liberalisation will do away with the need for FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion Board) clearance of FDI proposals on a case-by-case basis.

The budget will also implement the recommendations of the N K Singh Committee on enhancing the sectoral limits for foreign equity participation in key sectors including telecom and civil aviation.

The decision on these initiatives, being taken at the behest of the PMO and the finance ministry, has to be formalised in the next few days before the presentation of the budget on February 28.

14,Cricket commentary in Sanskrit to rule airwaves,"VADODARA: It may be a game the English gave to India, but it may not be just our cricketers beating them in their own backyard. Commentary too, may soon have an Indian tinge with centuries old Sanskrit taking over the airwaves.

â€˜Pashya pashya chowkaâ€™ (a glorious shot for four runs), â€˜sahatu chowkaâ€™, â€˜sarvatra prekshaka mandalie anandasya vatavaranamâ€™ (another four, the crowd is ecstatic), are not tongue-twisters. A Sanskrit scholar here is drawing up a cricket vocabulary like this to make the â€œdying languageâ€� appeal to the youth.

â€œAnd, what can attract them more than cricket,â€� says Ramanlal Pathak, the pioneer behind this novel format for Sanskrit commentary. He now plans to teach this â€œartâ€� and also plans to approach different audio-visual channels.

â€œThe popularity and reach of this game inspired me to learn more about it. I thought it could be an effective medium to popularise Sanskrit, which is dying a slow death,â€� says Pathak,who now plans to hold workshops for students to acquaint them with the language and its contemporary relevance.

It was not easy to develop a vocabulary in Sanskrit for a game which originated in England, says the scholar, who is working towards making Sanskrit more acceptable. But with his latest venture, he is confident of reaching out to a larger audience.

â€œFor seven years, I kept a close watch on the game. I made a database of equivalents in terminology of English and Sanskrit. A bowler would be addressed as â€˜Kanduka Kshepakaâ€™ and fielder as â€˜kshetra rakshakaâ€™. Later I realised that it should be simplified to appease the masses. So, I used â€˜Bat-dharâ€™ for batsman, â€˜gacchaâ€™ or â€˜dhavanâ€™ for runs and â€˜nivruttahâ€™ for getting out,â€� explains Pathak.

â€œThough it is a language of literature, it fell out of use as a colloquial tongue because it was perceived to be a difficult language. We want to eliminate this misconception,â€� says Pathak. â€œMy commentary in Sanskrit during Navratri, Ganesh Chaturthi and Uttarayan appealed to many. Some of them were also published,â€� says Pathak.

15,State govt earnest on banning gutkha,"GANDHINAGAR: Health minister I K Jadeja on Friday announced in the assembly that the government was earnest about banning the sale and production of gutkha, whose consumption endangers health.

Replying to queries on a question from Ambalal Rohit of the BJP during question hour, he said the government has implemented the directives issued by the Central government on banning gutkha.

Accordingly, the government has banned gutka sale near educational institutions and strictly implementing the same, he said. In a lighter vein, when Finance minister Vajubhai Vala asked as to how many members of this House were addicted to gutkha, for a while the minister was baffled and retorted that the gutkha could be banned in the state assembly complex only if the Speaker wished so.

Speaker Mangalbhai Patel sensed the membersâ€™ feelings and said it was possible only when gutkha was banned all over state. Jadeja said gutkha consumption could lead to dreaded diseases like cancer and cause kidney ailments.

16,BPL list revision after rural polls,"KOLKATA: Realising that correcting anomalies in the list of people living below poverty line may affect the poll fortunes of the ruling Left Front, the state government has decided to make the changes only after the panchayat election in May.

The distribution of the BPL cards is likely to remain incomplete in districts before the poll. The Opposition appeared satisfied that the CPM would not be able to harvest the fruits of â€˜BPL politicsâ€™ in the poll. The card will enable the poor people to get subsidised food, free hospitalisation and other benefits.

The tirade against the BPL list became shrill on Friday in the state assembly. The Opposition moved a non-official motion resolution alleging that the CPM and its partners are enlisting their wellto-do members at the cost of real poor.

They alleged that the â€˜privilegedâ€™ people included CPM MLA from Bankura Makar Tudu who owns a double storey house.

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattcharjee drew flak as the government failed to complete the list and distribution of the BPL card as promised. Minister for municipal affairs Asok Bhattacharya admitted discrepancies in the BPL list prepared by the panchayats in villages and municipalities in urban areas.

â€œWe have enlisted 19.7 million people so far. Neither the chief minister nor others in government have denied anomalies in the list.

Many really poor people may have been dropped while well-off people might have got berth. Tuduâ€™s name has already been deleted. All other errors will be rectified after panchayat poll. We do not want to play politics with the poor,â€� he assured. The Opposition, however, was not impressed. SUCI member Debaprasad Sarkar warned that unless the anomalies are undone immediately, rural Bengal will witness major social tension.

The state had taken up the exercise of enlisting only after being pulled up by the Supreme Court, said Trinamul Congress MLA Kalyan Banerjee. He complained that house-to-house survey was not conducted to ensure inclusion of the real poor.

Bhattacharjee blamed the Opposition-run local bodies for inflated the percentage of BPL population in their areas. While the Trinamul run Kolkata Corporation reported that only three per cent of the city population live under the BPL.
