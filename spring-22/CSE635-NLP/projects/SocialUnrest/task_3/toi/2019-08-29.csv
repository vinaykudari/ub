1,Haryana Cong legislature party not to change office-bearers,"CHANDIGARH: The Congress legislature party (CLP) in Haryana has decided not to change any of its office-bearers. As such, Ajay Singh Yadav will continue to be the deputy leader of the CLP which is now headed by Bhupinder Singh Hooda. A decision to this effect was taken by the CLP at its meeting presided over by Hooda, who was elected its leader on August 23 in the presence of AICC general secretary Mohsina Kidwai.

However, state Congress president Bhajan Lal and four other MLAs failed to attend the meeting. Voicing concern over prevailing drought conditions in the state and the governmentâ€™s failure to press Centre for the completion of Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal despite the Supreme Court ruling in the case, the CLP decided to forcefully raise these issues during the monsoon session of the Vidhan Sabha commencing here on September 2. The apex court in its January 15 ruling had directed Punjab to complete its portion of the canal within a year failing which it would be the responsibility of the Central government to get the canal completed through any of its agencies.

The Punjab government, however, is not willing to construct the canal on the plea that it has no surplus water to give to any state. The SYL canal is supposed to bring surplus Ravi-Beas water from Punjab to the southern districts of Haryana.

Meanwhile, all the 12 cells of the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) have decided to organise state-level â€œsammelansâ€� from October 25 to November 7. Announcing this, president of Haryana INLD Sher Singh Badshami said that the steps were being taken to expand the network of the party.

2,Govt tells principals to shop for mid-day meal rice,"MUMBAI: A shopping list was the last thing that the state government would send to school principals. At least that was what ML Phansekar thought. Last month, the head of Shailendra Education Societyâ€™s school at Dahisar realised he was wrong. The state government sent a directive to school principals to pitch in to keep its mid-day meal scheme afloatâ€”by purchasing their quota of rice from the fair price shops themselves.

Until now, the government transported rice to schools. â€œNow, they want us to purchase rice from the ration shops and distribute it among students,â€™â€™ explained Mr Phansekar. Like him, many of the cityâ€™s 1,184 civic and government school principals were appalled at the state governmentâ€™s directive. In fact, many schools decided that it was better to forfeit the rice than shop for it themselves, considering the time and money they would have to spend to transport the rice.

The standoff, the latest in a series of problems that have plagued the mid-day meal scheme, has brought the programme to a halt in Mumbai.The scheme covers 4.4 lakh city students in classes I to V and was started as an incentive for children to attend school. Each student receives three kilos of rice every month as part of the programme. The central government funds the scheme,while the states pick up the rice from the Food Corporation of India.

At least, thatâ€™s how itâ€™s supposed to work on paper. In Maharashtra, the distribution network has been patchy and riddled with corruption. For instance, government officials in Sangli were found to have misappropriated 6,000 quintals of rice, valued at more than Rs 72 lakh, between 1998 and 1999. Around the same time, in Aurangabad, officials made a quick buck by selling in the open market thousands of quintals of rice meant for the scheme.

Mumbai didnâ€™t fare any better. Last year, none of the city schools received any rice. Then, this May, principals found truckloads of rice in their school front-yards. â€œThe government sent us the quota for the whole year, at one go, in May,â€™â€™ said Ramakant Pandey, principal of Bansidhar Agarwal school, Wadala. There were no students in school then and principals had no idea what to do with the rice. â€œSchools had no place to store the rice, so many just sent it back,â€™â€™ Mr Pandey said. As if that was not disastrous enough, the government this year came up with the doyour-own-shopping idea. No one, not even the municipal corporationâ€”the governmentâ€™s implementing agency for the mid-day meal scheme in Mumbaiâ€” knows why the state hit upon this plan. â€œWe have told government officials that it is not possible for schools to lift rice,â€™â€™ said Mesta Sulabha, administrative officer of the civic education department.

At many schools, such as Don Bosco at Matunga, principals organised Parent Teachersâ€™ Association meetings and passed resolutions saying no to the rice. To placate principals, the state government issued a circular last week, saying that the non-salary grant it gives to schools for meeting maintenance expenses would be expanded to cover the costs of transporting the rice. It wasnâ€™t enough to convince school authorities, though. â€œAs it is, they havenâ€™t paid us the non-salary grant for the last three years,â€™â€™ said Mr Phansekar.

School education department officials, meanwhile, said that committees will be set up in each ward to work out how to distribute the rice. â€œA ration card will be given to each school and authorities can collect their quota against that,â€™â€™ said S.P. Joshi, deputy education secretary.

3,R K Sharma’s lawyer picks holes in police theory,"NEW DELHI: The police story of a relationship between journalist Shivani Bhatnagar and IPS officer Ravi Kant Sharma is â€˜â€˜full of vulgarity and the product of a perverse mindâ€™â€™ â€” amounting to character assassination, Sharmaâ€™s lawyer contended in the high court on Wednesday.

Arguments on the anticipatory bail of Sharma which had not finished when Justice M A Khan adjourned the hearing, will now resume on Monday. â€˜â€˜It is not only vulgar and perverse but it is also full of absurdities. By making oblique hints at a relationship, the police is trying to project that there was an illicit relationship between the two,â€™â€™ Sharmaâ€™s lawyer Dinesh Mathur told the court.

Squarely taking on the police, Mathur said to establish their theory the police have depended on such â€˜ridiculousâ€™â€™ facts as Shivani telling her relative to call up Sharma and inform him about the childâ€™s birth.

â€˜â€˜How do they (the police) establish that there was some intimate relation between the two? Through a telephone call?â€™â€™ Mathur contended, saying it was natural for people to call up their near and dear ones when a child is born. â€˜â€˜It is nothing but a police story, whose wisdom has never been questioned,â€™â€™ Mathur remarked.

Citing various judgments from the Supreme Court, Mathur argued that under the law, bail was the rule and jail an exception.

â€˜â€˜The court may impose conditions, but any person anticipating arrest is fully entitled to bail, especially when he has been cooperating with the investigating agency in the past. He also accused the police of planting stories in the media and took strong exception to a newspaper report which quoted deputy commissioner of police M S Upadhye saying: â€˜â€˜He (Sharma) cannot get bail now.â€™â€™

4,Ex-minister moves court for surrender,"KANPUR: Former minister for minorities welfare and waqf Buniyad Hussain Ansari has moved an application of surrender before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate Kanpur on Wednesday.

The ex-minister in his application submitted that he came to know that he was wanted in a case of misappropriation of funds which was being investigated by special investigation branch of UP co-operative cell.

According to investigation officer, funds to the tune of Rs 60 lakh meant for stipend were misappropriated. The entire amount was deposited in Federal Co-operative Bank on the direction of the minister and another former minister Raja Ghazanfar Ali. To draw this amount fraudulently as many as 1,500 bogus schools were raised on paper and the entire amount of Rs 60 lakh was withdrawn. The matter came in light when CB CID co-operative cell was investigating embezzlement in the Federal Co-operative Bank to the tune of Rs 9 crore.

The Reserve Bank had given permission to open only one branch while the directors of the bank opened five branches. The two ministers had directed to deposit the funds of the department in this bank instead of nationalised bank. Ghazanfar was arrested last month in this connection and was released on bail after a fortnight.

During investigation, the name of Buniyad Hussain Ansari also came to light and it was found that a handsome amount was deposited on the direction of the minister. The investigation agency was about to arrest him.

5,‘Root out corruption on road to development’,"ALLAHABAD: Union HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi, while addressing a series of public meetings in connection with the inauguration of various development projects in the Karchana assembly segment - part of his trans-Yamuna Parliamentary constituency - on Wednesday. The minister made a strong plea for accelerating the pace of development in all spheres of activity, for which, he felt corruption needed to be weeded out first.

On the second day of his four-day visit to his Parliamentary constituency, Dr Joshi, who undertook a hectic tour in the trans-Yamuna Karchana areas, inaugurated the long pending Rs 5.5 crore Kondhar Ghat bridge over the river Tons.

The foundation stone of the bridge had been laid in 1988 during the Congress regime, but had consequently been neglected by subsequent governments. It was following the initiative of Dr Joshi, that a sum of Rs 2 crore was sanctioned in 1994. Later, he got an additional Rs 1.67 crore released for construction of the approach road.

In the course of his visit, Dr Joshi also laid the foundation stone of the science building and inaugurated a computer centre at the Brig Mangal Singh Inter-College. He also addressed party workers at the venue.

In his address, the Union minister recalled the Prime Ministerâ€™s recent Independence Day announcement, that India is to become a â€˜superpowerâ€™ in the 21st century and observed that the only road available was through developments in the fields of science and technology. He emphasised the need for rapid development to facilitate this.

He regretted that corruption has assumed serious proportions and it has become the biggest obstacle in the march of the country on the road to development.

While taking a vow to make Allahabad an â€˜ideal districtâ€™, Dr Joshi said that beautification work in the vicinity of the bridge would also be undertaken. Similarly, he pointed out, a science city, which would be coming up very soon, would help in the growth of science and technology in the district. He pointed out that the Shankargarh refinery project, which is in the pipeline, would also boost developmental activity in the district and bring prosperity to it. He cautioned people against those playing politics with development.

6,HC lawyer held for links with gangsters,"LUCKNOW: Despite a daring encounter in which the Special Task Force (STF) personnel took on listed criminals at great risk to their own lives, there seems little coming as appreciation for the sleuths.

Instead of applause and appreciation from the government, the STF officials remained glued to their offices preparing answers for the questions put up before the treasury in the state assembly.

While, on the one hand was the connection of the deceased criminals with the high-profile politicians, including ministers, on the other hand the arrest of a High Court lawyer in Allahabad on Wednesday on charges of his connivance with the slain alleged criminals is all set to bring the STF face-to-face with the lawyersâ€™ fraternity.

Wednesday witnessed quite some heat in the assembly when the connections of the criminals with a former Member of Parliament from Padrauna region, another MLA from Sahjanwa area, one ruling party MLA, a student union leader from Ghazipur came to the fore during the interrogation of Satyendra Kumar Srivastava alias Shiv Kumar, the third associate of Jayesh who was arrested after the encounter.

While the government took the STF head-on over the arrest of High Court lawyer Vijaya Nand Maurya, it is likely to stir a hornetâ€™s nest. Maurya had bought a SIM card in his name and attached the copy of his driving licence for address verification. This SIM card was recovered from mobile phone of Jayesh, sources in Allahabad said.

There was also information that Maurya was allegedly acting as a manager of Jayesh in Allahabad arranging for his needs. Sources said that the police were now on the lookout for 2 AK series rifles, 1 carbine, 4 pistols and 1 revolver of Jayesh which was at present with his absconding gang members.

Regarding political connections of Jayesh, reports were that he had even come to the Vidhan Sabha gate number 7, entered the premises to meet his mentor. Jayesh was, however, cunning enough to use a coded language while talking about shady deals on phone for the fear of his telephone being tapped.

Despite liquidating such a high-profile gangster the STF seems to have rolled back into a cocoon even as senior officials remained elusive for the media all day long and were not willing to speak on anything related to the encounter which took place in Rae Bareli on Tuesday afternoon.

7,Development of Buddhist circuit Govt’s top priority,"LUCKNOW: In her maiden appearance in the Vidhan Parishad in this session, chief minister Mayawati said the development of the Buddhist circuit would be the priority of her government and stressed that tourism in Uttar Pradesh would not be allowed to suffer.

The CM said plans and projects were on the anvil for developing and inter-connecting all places associated with Lord Buddha. In her earlier tenure the new district of Sravasti had been carved out from Bahriach to ensure its all round development on account of its association with Buddha. Pending projects as well as new ones would now be taken on a priority basis, she added.

Mayawati said when the state government would take a keen interest in the development of Buddhist circuit, then only the Buddhist countries would also show interest in Uttar Pradesh. The cabinet had already okayed the proposal for the construction of an international airport at Kushinagar and a budgetary provision of Rs 1,020 crore had been made for the development of the infrastructure of the Buddhist circuit. Likewise, a sum of Rs 115 lakh had been earmarked for the Braj circuit, she informed the House. The CM said, amidst smiles, that she was prepared to provide the full data to the members except that they would say that all the money was being utilised for these projects only.

The CM intervened in the course of a reply by urban development and tourism minister Lalji Tandon to a question posed by Panchanan Rai on what steps the government had taken towards the development of tourism in UP following the creation of the new state of Uttranchal. Tandon admitted that tourism had suffered a setback and the tourist inflow had also fallen as many important tourist spots had gone to the new state. Nevertheless, the government was taking all steps to keep up the inflow.

With this end in view, the minister said the government was developing Garh Mukteshwar as an alternative to Haridwar. Emphasis was also being laid on the Buddhist circuit. To a poser by Rai, the minister denied that any survey had been carried out to assess the drop in the tourist inflow. He informed the circuit would connect all places associated with Lord Buddha and would extend from Varanasi to Kushinagar and then to Bihar.

Later in the zero hour Rajesh Mishra of the Congress raised the issue of the disappearance of Kashinath Pandey of Varanasi. Recounting the sequence of event Mishra said Pandey was intimately associated with the RSS and was known as the Madan Mohan Malwiya of Varanasi. He had renounced all his property in favour of the Lok Nyas trust of which the BJP and RSS members were the office bearers. Pandey had been taken to Kharagpur by Arvind Kodia on March 31 and had not returned since then.

Leader of the House Swami Prasad Maurya said orders had already been issued to find the whereabouts of Pandey to which the acting chairman Manvendra Singh gave the ruling that a high-level inquiry by a senior officer be conducted and the House informed about its findings.

The death of two people of Sahjanwa village in Gorakhpur was raised by Devendra Pratap Singh of the Samajwadi Party. He said despite being informed in advance the police had failed to take any pre-emtive steps which could have averted the killings. Maurya informed the House that the police station incharge had been suspended.

8,Dharna staged for minister’s dismissal,"PATNA: Members of the Bihar Pradesh Khet Mazdoor Sabha on Wednesday submitted a memorandum to chief minister Rabri Devi, demanding the dismissal of state minister for health Akhilesh Kumar Singh for violating the minimum wages Act in his native village in the Arwal district.

A large number of villagers belonging to the Jehanabad and Arwal districts on Wednesday staged a daylong dharna at the Income-Tax roundabout demanding the dismissal of Singh.

Earlier, they took out a procession in the city. A delegation handed over a four-point charter of demands to the chief ministerâ€™s secretariat. Their demands included implementation of minimum wages in the panchayats of Koel (Singhâ€™s village) and Rustampur (village of Jagdish Sharma, Ghosi MLA), dismissal of Singh for his links with Ranveer Sena, withdrawal of cases against labourers and dismissal of Hulasganj police station OC.

9,KLO men in govt offices: CPI,"KOLKATA: Militants belonging to the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) have infiltrated the police and administration in Jalpaiguri, feels the CPI. A party delegation, led by state secretary Manju Majumdar, has just returned after an on-the -spot survey of the militancy-hit areas of north Bengal.

â€œThere are reasons to suspect that the KLO has infiltrated both the police and administration,â€� Majumdar said on Wednesday.

â€œTerrorists have been attacking us since 1999. Intelligence agencies had alerted them (the police and administration) of such strikes. Yet they failed to prevent the Dhupguri killings. This makes us suspicious,â€� Majumdar said. He said his party would talk to the chief minister and raise the issue during the Left Front meeting.

Majumdar also advised the police to restrain themselves while raiding villages in search of KLO activists and not to arrest or harass the innocent.

â€œThe people, who were sympathetic to the KLO, have now begun to realise their mistake after the gruesome Dhupguri killing. Police high-handedness might once again change their mood,â€� he observed.

The CPI, which is convinced that the KLO has links even with the Peopleâ€™s War, however, made it clear that whatever be the law and order situation in the state, it was not in favour of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (Poca).

â€œThe chief minister wanted to introduce Poca. But even he is silent about it now. In any case, the police have successfully cracked many crimes even without an anti-terrorist law,â€� observed CPI leader and state water investigation minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya.

As part of its political process to combat extremism and divisive forces, the CPI suggested greater cooperation with Left parties still outside the Front.

It also proposed that the Front build up movements on peopleâ€™s issues to earn their trust.

The failures and incapability of the Left Front should also be admitted, it felt.

10,Infighting ruining us: CM to party,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has put his partymen on notice. He has told them to put an immediate end to their bickering or face disciplinary action.

Naidu issued the fiat hours before leaving for New Delhi on Wednesday, worried that he is by the humiliating defeat in the Palasa-Kasibugga municipal polls. Palasa-Kasibugga is in Srikakulam district, a Telugu Desam stronghold.

Defeats such as these, he believes, would send wrong signals to the public. The assembly polls are two years away and this drubbing could not have come at a worse time. He is just as worried by the wafer-thin margin by which the party won the Medak byelection.

""Our behaviour is giving an opportunity to the opposition to launch anti-government propaganda,"" Naiduâ€™s message to his partymen said. Worried over the TDPâ€™s dismal showing in the recent elections, the chief minister commissioned the intelligence department to carry out a comprehensive constituency-wise analysis.

Although intelligence SP M V Dinakar Prasad said the report was not validated, The Times of India has learnt that the survey looked at seven key parameters and found that the TDPâ€™s popularity is on the wane. The functioning of the ministers and legislators is far from satisfactory.

Naidu apparently got a shock from the findings, which said infighting and groupism is rife in the party, much like the Congress.

""In most villages, the TDP has two groups and they quarrel bitterly among themselves. Consequence: The TDP is losing its image and the Congress capitalising on it,â€™â€™ the report says.

Referring to Anantapur district in particular, the report says: ""Penugonda legislator and former minister Paritala Ravindra is unhappy with the TDP government, for he was not accommodated in the cabinet. Ravindra is an important leader in the district. Since he was not given any importance, he is not evincing much interest in district politics."" It also has some harsh words for ministers. It mentions Nimmala Kistappa, animal husbandry minister, in particular.

11,Notification for 2nd phase of J&K polls issued,"SRINAGAR: The Election Commission on Thursday issued notification for the second phase of polls to be held for 28 constituencies of Jammu, Srinagar and Budgam districts on September 24.

12,Oppn politicking picks up ahead of polls,"NEW DELHI: The Samajwadi Party has extended a hand of friendship to the Congress, but the relationship comes at a price: commitment of support in UP.

While SP leader Amar Singh put the ball in the Congress court on Wednesday, saying the party was eager for an alliance in Gujarat, there is fine print to the offer. ""Nothing is possible without a firm undertaking that whenever there is a chance to topple the communal BSP-BJP combine in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress will throw its lot with the SP,"" a senior party leader told Times News Network.

The leader pointed out that the frantic efforts at cobbling together a unified Opposition was essentially aimed at a Congress-led force coming to power at the Centre under Sonia Gandhi. ""They stand to gain everything with an alliance, but there has to be a quid pro quo,"" he said.

The Samjwadi Party, miffed with the Left for disbanding the People''s Front over support to A P J Abdul Kalam in the presidential elections, pointedly stayed away from a dinner at CPM leader Somnath Chatterjee''s residence on Tuesday. But to make sure that the wrong signal did not go out to the Congress, Amar Singh was in touch with Sonia Gandhi to assure her that it had nothing to do with her being there.

At the dinner, the Opposition parties present agreed to take on the BJP unitedly in Gujarat, ensuring straight contests in a bid to combine secular forces. However, with the exception of the Congress, other leaders present like CPM leader Jyoti Basu, RJD supremo Laloo Yadav, and former Prime Ministers V P Singh, H D Deve Gowda and I K Gujral have little electoral standing in the state.

Those who can be of nuisance value are NCP and the SP. With the NCP already indicating that it would field candidates for all seats, having the SP on its side will only help the Congress cause.

There are two views on a tie-up with the SP within the Congress, with a section of leaders saying it would affect the party''s prospects in Gujarat adversely. But the party leadership is clearly eyeing the bigger prize, Delhi, with a joint Opposition challenging the NDA.

Sonia Gandhi herself has been forthcoming, having met and had several conversations with Amar Singh since the SP decided to bury the hatchet and support the Congress vice-presidential candidate Sushil Kumar Shinde earlier this month.

The SP is not averse to propping Sonia as a joint Opposition leader, but only if she promises a similar arrangement for Mulayam Singh Yadav in UP. The SP is the single-largest party in the state with 147 MLAs, and will be within striking distance of a majority (203) in the 404-member Assembly with the Congress'' 25 MLAs.

With the ruling BSP-BJP alliance in UP anything but easy, the SP expects a split there. ""At that moment, we want the Congress to support us,"" the SP leader said. ""The Congress argument that going with us will destroy the party in UP is tenuous. In any case they have no base there.""

14,Founder of Ranvir Sena arrested,"PATNA: The Patna police on Thursday achieved a major breakthrough by arresting the fugitive leader of Ranvir Sena, Brahmeshwar Singh Mukhiya, the alleged masterminded behind more than 500 killings in central Bihar.

Aadditional director-general of police (Patna zone) Ashish Ranjan said that a three-member task force constituted by the state government raided a hotel at Exhibition Road here and captured the founder of the private militia of landlords, which had let loose a reign of terror.

Singh, carrying a cash award of Rs 5 lakh on his head, is the prime accused in the 1996 Laxmanpur Bathe massacre of 61 Dalits, besides Miapur carnage of 34 people, which was carried out to avenge the killing of 34 upper caste people at village Senari in Jehanabad district in 1998.

Singh, allegedly championing the cause of Bhumihars and providing protection to their lands, has also been charged with masterminding several other crimes involving killing of people belonging to the oppressed section of the society.

Sinha said that soon after his arrest, Singh was sent to the high-security Beur Model Jail on the outskirts of the state capital.

He added that the state government might consider booking Singh under Prevention of Terrorism Act. Ranvir Sena is locked in a war of attrition with the outlawed naxal outfits People''s War Group and Maoist Communist Centre.

""Our basic stand of June 1999 that a person of foreign origin should not become Prime Minister cannot be compromised at all"", party spokesman Nasim Siddiqui told reporters here. He said Congress leaders including pradesh unit chief Govindrao Adik''s criticism of NCP general secretary P A Sangma for his recent remarks ""was uncalled for"". ""Maharashtra unit of NCP endorses Sangma''s views on the issue word by word. If on this issue, Congress wants to pull out of DF all alternatives are open for it"", he said. He, however, said NCP was committed to keep ""communal"" saffron combine out of power in Maharashtra. ""The frequent threats to us that on Sonia''s issue we can walk out of coalition is not acceptable to us"", he said. Answering questions, he said NCP did not mind any other Congress leader replacing Chief Minister Vilasrao Desmukh. NCP as a policy would not mind change in CLP leadership, he said, adding ""our understanding is with Congress to run a coalition. Change in CLP leadership is their internal matter"". He denied any meeting had taken place between NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and senior Congress leader Suresh Kalmadi. The NCP spokesman attacked BJP and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for their ""motivated"" campaign against Election Commission and CEC J M Lyngdoh.

17,Staff suicide stalls work at Writers’ Building,"KOLKATA: Work at the state secretariat came to a halt on Thursday afternoon when a law department employee committed suicide by jumping out of the second floor balcony.

Sukumar Dinda, 47, was a Group C staff and the police are yet to discover what led to the suicide.

At around 2:45 pm, Dinda, who had been working in the records section of the law department, suddenly jumped off the second floor balcony of the G block. â€œI had come to buy muri at the G-Block. Suddenly, I heard people shouting and saw a man falling off the balcony and hitting the ground. Someone tried to revive him by pumping his chest, by which time the police arrived,â€� Sushanta Mitra, a peon of the state information and cultural affairs department, said.

The news spread like wildfire throughout the state secretariat, and in a few minutes, the place where Dinda fell was swarming with people.

The police took Dinda away in an ambulance normally earmarked for ministers, but by then, there was complete chaos. As a fresh batch of policemen arrived to clear the crowd, groups of people continued to peer from the balconies - clearly, work was over for the afternoon. The extent of Dindaâ€™s injuries were not clear; moreover, there were no blood marks at the spot. The victim was a resident of Bali in Howrah and entered the departmentâ€™s service as a Group D peon in 1985 after the death of his father Baikunthanath Dinda, who worked in the same department. â€œHe was always a very soft spoken man, regular in his duties. We never found him to be depressed,â€� section officer Kalyan Chakraborty said.

Dinda is survived by his wife and two sons. â€œWe never got any hint of any family troubles or other problems,â€� an employee in the law department said.

18,Ex-army man arrested for Alibag murders,"ALIBAG: The police on Wednesday arrested former army man Ganesh Shanker Mhatre for the murder of a woman and her two children here on Monday.

19,Cops' role in Godhra riots comes under scanner,"AHMEDABAD: The role of the local police in the riots at Godhra town, immediately after the burning of the Sabarmati express on February 27, has come under a scanner with the Godhra sessions court charging them of attempting to ""drag the names of several people in this incident, purely in a fit of emotion"".

Dismissing the case as being weak and loaded with discrepancies, the court cast aspersions on the role of the police as they were the complainants as well as the witnesses.

Among the accused acquited in this case, are aprime accused in the train carnage former Godhra municipality president Mohammad Husain Abdulrahim Kalota and former councillor Haji Bilal Abdulmajid Sujela.

The judgement delivered on August 9 by sessions court judge Viral Desai, acquitting the accused, notes that ""the accused cannot be held responsible for this offence since the investigations do not appear independent and systematic"".

The trial uncovers the role of the police officers including then police inspector of Godhra town police station KS Trivedi who has been transferred to Bhavnagar since. The police had on March 13 recovered three swords, ten daggers and three iron rods from a sewer near Aman guest house (which belongs to Razzak Kurkur), reportedly on a confession from Abdulrehman Abdulmajid Dhantiya who was arrested on February 28.

The court questioned Trivedi''s role in this recovery on the grounds that the investigations were being carried out by police sub-inspector RD Solanki, and pointed, ""on what grounds has Trivedi conducted the inquest of this recovery is not clear"". It further stated that the ""two witnesses in this case did not support the complainant and the police seems to have taken their signatures by not telling them what it was all about"".

Interestingly, the court also observed that ""although, the accused Abdul Rehman Abdul Majid Dhantiya discovered the weapons used by the Muslim mob, none of the eyewitnesses have said that anyone in the mob had daggers, which cast a doubt on the investigations conducted by Trivedi"".

The court also noted that a copy of the complaint was given to the judicial magistrate four days after the incident ""which raised doubts on the complainant"". Taking strong note of the fact that the complainant and the witnesses in the case were policemen, the court said that the eye-witnesses in this case were assistant sub-inspector Mansukhbhai Rumal, police constables Vipulkumar Natwarlal, Dilipkumar Chandubhai, Bhikhabhai Kanabhai, Parvatbhai Somabhai and others who worked under the complainant, sub-inspector SJ Pawar, ""so it could not be ruled out that they were helping each other"".

It commented on Pawar''s cross-examination where he told the court that fifteen names were included in the list of the accused ""on the behest of a policeman, but he did not clarify which were these names"". Constable Parvatbhai, who claimed to have spotted Haji Bilal, Kalota, Kurkur, Irfan Pado, Kasim Biryani and others in the mob, also claims that he arrested them around 2-3 pm from near Neelam lodge. But, ""the incident at Neelam lodge was over before noon"", the court observed. During the cross-examination, this constable then admitted that he had got the names from one accused who was arrested.

Taking a serious note of the discrepancies in their statements, the court remarked, ""there is no justification yet, as to on what grounds were these 72 persons chosen from the mob of 2,000 for this case"".

21,Power minister rules out withdrawing tariff hike,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the hike in power charges announced by the Kerala government evoked widespread protests from various quarters in the state, Power minister Kadavoor Sivadasan on Thursday ruled out the possibility of re-considering government''s decision.

""The government is forced to take the decision due to the continuing financial instability of the KSEB coupled with the monsoon failure"", Sivadasan told reporters here on Thursday.

The state had to depend more on costlier thermal power and even after imposing thermal surchage of 50 paise per unit and through rationalisation of tariff structure, the board would be left with a deficit of rs 112 crores per month, he said.

Stating that this was the only option open before the government, he asked the opposition LDF, which was triggering agitation against the hike, to put forward any alternative to tide over the present power crisis.

""We are ready to withdraw the decision if the opposition puts forward a viable alternative proposal"", he said.

22,NGOs come together for development,"NEW DELHI: The Times Foundation organised a meeting of non-government organisations (NGOs) on August 27 and 28 in an effort to create a forum for sustainable development.

Among those present were Surekha Sabbarwal of UNDP, Yoo Fakazawa of the Japan Foundation, John Chalones of Plan International and Poonam Muttreja of the Mac Arthur Foundation.

Many participants, like Dr Manavalan of AFRO and members of Sakshi and the Young Menâ€™s Christian Association, felt that the Times Foundation, with the support of The Times of India, was uniquely poised to act as a platform for creating awareness about social issues.

It could play a pioneering role in bringing about policy changes as well as disseminating information to citizens.

Said Surekha Sabbarwal: â€˜â€˜Agencies need to come together to work cohesively towards specific agendas and issues concerning development.â€™â€™

Diego Palacis of UNFPA felt that the platform provided by the Foundation would give his organisation an advantage in advocating population and development issues.

Ashoke Maitra, Times Foundationâ€™s director-incharge, said the Foundationâ€™s endeavour was to usher in positive social change. To this end, it has been working to create a platform of convergence between NGOs, government and corporate bodies.

It has already organised meetings in various cities, including Mumbai and Pune, to this end.

23,HC bans govt hospital strikes in city,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has banned strikes in all government hospitals in the city, holding that patients have a right to life and health, which overrides all other interests. The court had already banned strikes in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). From Thursday, all state-run hospitals have come in the purview of the court order.

Taking exception to the tactics of arm-twisting of patients adopted by the Unions, a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice S B Sinha and Justice A K Sikri, said: â€˜â€˜We are of the opinion that the treatment, which was given to AIIMS in the May 20 order, needs to be extended to all the hospitals run by the Centre and the Delhi government.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜We also expect the government to set up a permanent negotiation/committee and consider constitution of arbitral tribunal on the lines suggested in case of AIIMS and make necessary modification in the service rules,â€™â€™ the Bench ordered. Extending the May 20 order passed on AIIMS strike, the Bench said: â€˜â€˜The court while giving such direction was not oblivious to the right of the agitated employees to resort to a peaceful agitation.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜However, it found that the public interest, keeping in view the sensitive nature of the hospital functioning, would outweigh other considerations and it was necessary to ensure uninterrupted and smooth functioning of each and every sphere of activity of the hospital,â€™â€™ the Bench observed.

The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in this regard was filed by one Salekh Chand Jain on August 8 last. Jainâ€™s lawyer Sugriva Dubey said there was an impending strike threat which the government had failed to check and the patents would be the ultimate victims. When matter came up for hearing on August 13, the government informed the court that the employees had called off their strike and the petition was disposed of with that assurance.

However, the petition was readmitted when employees owing allegiance to the joint action committee of health employees and other trade unions again declared strike from Aug 19 to 23.

The strike hours, timed to hit the patients hard, was chosen between 9 am to 3 pm. The union also threatened that no employee or patient would be allowed to go inside the hospital during these hours. The court again issued a notice to the government and the union. But union persistently kept ignoring the notices.

Expressing displeasure at the unionâ€™s stance, the Bench observed union office-bearers had â€˜â€˜deliberately and intentionally avoided to appear in the court.â€™â€™

The Delhi government submitted a detailed action plan it intended to enforce on the striking employees, but the court was skeptic of the governmentâ€™s ability to carry it out.

â€˜â€˜We are of the opinion that the required steps have been taken by the government. However, it would be appropriate to find a lasting solution to such problems,â€™â€™ the Bench observed.

24,GP polls may be vested in govt hands,"BANGALORE: The state government proposes to withdraw the powers of the State Election Commission (SEC) over polls to the posts of presidents and vice-presidents of the state''s 5,659 gram panchayats.

The government is expected to table an ordinance to this effect before the cabinet on Friday. ``This is a ridiculous move because the government''s motive is to bring its men in these local bodies. The government will virtually rule the elections now,'''' sources told The Times of India.

Earlier, deputy commissioners (DCs) conducted the elections on instruction from the SEC. Now, the ordinance will give powers to the state government.

Interestingly, on August 19, the SEC directed all deputy commissioners (DCs) to finalise the list of categories for elections due in September. Friday is the last date for allocating posts to different categories. The 30-month term of presidents and vice-presidents of GPs comes to an end this month.

``The DCs have completed categorising candidates for reservations. With this ordinance, the whole exercise will become futile,'''' sources added.

25,Nagappa's father-in-law blames Raju Gowda,"MADIKERI: A 90-minute drive from Madikeri to Kyate village, the native place of Parimala, wife of abducted former minister Nagappa, tells us one thing.

Unlike other politicians, Nagappa never spoke of his links with Kodagu during his term as APMC minister. But he did a lot to develop market yards at Shanivarsanthe, Kodlipet and Somwarpet, besides other things. His last visit to Kyate village from here was in May.

When reporters approached the once silent house on Wednesday, Kyate S. Shanthamallappa (87), father-in-law of the abducted minister, alleged that political rival of Nagappa and district in-charge minister Raju Gowda was behind the kidnapping. ""Veerappan had been threatening to kidnap my son-in-law and now he did it.''''

He said of the 10 demands the brigand has put forth, six have been fulfilled. ``We have to get Nagappa released by fulfilling all his demands,'''' Shanthamallappa said.

Hemalatha Jayaprakash, daughter-in-law of Shanthamallappa, said Nagappa is a diabetic and he needs regular medication. She said the former minister was not insistent on security but would go on night drives all alone. ``He is weak. I don''t know how he is managing himself.''''

Indira Paramesh, another daughter-in-law, said she had casually enquired with the police guarding Nagappa''s house about Veerappan a day before the kidnapping. ``We were decorating the house for a baby''s birthday on Saturday. I saw the police gun kept in a corner and asked him is there any latest report about Veerappan''? He casually replied ''He is only threatening people and will not come this side''. ''And within 24 hours, Veerappan entered the house'', said Indira.

26,JD(U) wants govt to handle crisis seriously,"BANGALORE: The Janata Dal (U) has made it clear that the state government will have to take the entire responsibility if ``something untoward'''' happens while getting former minister H. Nagappa released from the clutches of forest brigand Veerappan.

In a joint letter addressed to Chief Minister S.M. Krishna, JD(U) leaders P.G.R. Sindhia and B.N. Bachche Gowda have expressed their solidarity to the government''s rescue efforts although ``nothing has been made clear'''' to them.

``We are given to understand that the state government is all set to launch an operation in tandem with the Tamil Nadu government and by getting more forces from the Centre. We, however, have not been informed of the details. We believe that you have considered all the pros and cons of the steps you contemplate to take. What strategy is to be adopted is left to the state government''s wisdom. We will stand by you. But the safe rescue of Nagappa should be the topmost priority,'''' they said.

Recalling the efforts made by the government to get Kannada thespian Rajkumar released, Sindhia and Gowda urged Krishna to show the ``same seriousness'''' and take ``similar action'''' to get Nagappa rescued.
