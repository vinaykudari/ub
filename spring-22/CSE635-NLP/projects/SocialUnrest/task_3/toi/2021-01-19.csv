0,"6,500 govt teaching posts lying vacant","NEW DELHI: If you visit a government school and find class rooms empty before closing time, don''t be surprised. With almost 6,500 teaching posts vacant, the scene is perhaps a common one in many schools.

According to the latest figures available with the government school teachers'' association (GSTA), there is a shortage of 6,426 teachers in the city''s government schools.

The vacancies include virtually all posts like principal, vice principal, trained graduate teacher (TGT) who teach uptill Class X, and post graduate teacher (PGT) who teach the senior secondary classes.

As teachers and authorities argue over facts, students continue to suffer with some schools being short of as many as 20 teachers.

""Some schools like Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalay, Shastri Park and government boys school, Tughlakabad extension are short of almost 18 to 20 teachers. There is no way of holding back students in classrooms when there are no teachers to teach them,"" said GSTA president, Om Singh.

Many schools also don''t have teachers for non-academic subjects like physical education, music, craft and dramatics. While there is a shortage of over 400 lab assistants, a total of 111 librarians are also missing from schools.

While authorities claim that recruitment is an ""ongoing process"", teachers say the the assurances are just an eyewash.

""Posts are gradually filled throughout the year and recruitments have been made from time to time,"" said an official at the directorate of education.

Out of the total vacant posts, 75 per cent are filled up by promotions, while there is direct recruitment for the remaining 25 per cent.

Teachers say the shortfall has been affecting studies for over a year but there has been no move in the directorate to call a meeting of the departmental promotion committee (DPC). The DPC last met in November 2002 in which about 1,100 teachers had been promoted.

While Class X and XII being the board classes, are the worst hit, teachers say the shortfall is creating problems for primary students as well.

""While one post in our school is vacant, the other teacher is on maternity leave. There is no provision for sending substitute teachers and schools are not even free to allow volunteers from the parent teacher association to manage the class. It''s a chaotic start to school for primary students,"" said R M Mohla, a teacher at the Sarvaodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Tilak Nagar.

1,120 govt schools run from the open,"NEW DELHI: Tin sheds, porta cabins, tents... welcome to the government schools of the city. As per a Delhi government survey, there are about 120 schools awaiting suitable plots to construct buildings.

Even if the plots are sanctioned, many are not fit for school buildings. And there are some, which though alloted years back, are yet to be located on Delhi''s map.

Officials admit poor school infrastructure to be the bane of government education for the urban poor. It starts with the constant tussle between the government and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for allotment of plots.

A senior official says: ""Even if the plots are alloted by the DDA, other civic agencies like Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC), fight over the building plan which derails the proposed construction.""

""Last year we managed to get 50 plots from DDA, but the building plans for those plots are yet to be approved. There are some whose plans have been pending for the last five years. In east Delhi, four plots had to be surrendered as they were of no use,"" he adds.

The government blames both MCD and DUAC for the avoidable delay. An official says: ""The DUAC takes a lot of time even though there is not much scope for it to interfere in a school building plan. But then it has to take note of class room size, provision of bathrooms, doors and windows.""

Senior DUAC member H K Yadav explains: ""Our suggestions are only to make improvement in the proposed designs, if possible. We want to make the best use of such plots. For example, high schools must have space for sports and cultural activities, and the exteriors must be designed in harmony with the building plan.""

Construction of schools does not rate very high in the priority of the MCD. Usually a building is constructed three years after a requisition is received.

""Once a requirement is sent to the engineering department, it is prioritised according to the area or the need, sometimes even political pressure. The process of opening tenders takes 2-3 months but can drag onto even 6 months,"" says an MCD engineer.

3,"No joint elections, says Krishna","BANGALORE: Chief minister S M Krishna on Monday spiked speculation about simultaneous polls in Karnataka and said elections to the Legislative Assembly will be held in September â€” on schedule.

â€œElections to the Lok Sabha are round the corner. In September, we are going to have one more election,â€™â€™ Krishna told senior police officers at the inauguration of their annual convention here.

Speaking to reporters, Krishna declined to elaborate on the polls. â€œYou heard my speech. You can draw your own conclusions... inferences. I donâ€™t think I can be more specific than what I said. I reached my optimum capacity in expressing,â€™â€™ he said.

Asked whether he discussed Karnataka elections with Congress president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s during his visit to New Delhi last week, Krishna said: â€œThe political situation was discussed substantially.â€™â€™ Later, Krishna held meetings with Assembly speaker M.V. Venkatappa and Council chairman B.L. Shankar on dates for convening the budget session.

It is learnt that both presiding officers have left it to the government to decide on the dates. The issue is expected to figure in the cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Sources said the legislature is likely to meet briefly in February first week. â€œIt is still not known whether Krishna would like to present a full-fledged budget or seek a vote-on-account. He is keeping it a well- guarded secret,â€™â€™ they stated. Since both Houses have not been prorogued, the government can fix the session dates.

The corporators, not comfortable with the decision for obvious reasons, have decided to approach the minister for solution. After much trying, the corporators managed to get time from the minister.

But, however, the corporators deny that they will be talking only about their corporator''s quota. ""There are other things like development and renovation that are also on our agenda,"" said a corporator.

5,3 trains delayed due to protests,"LUCKNOW: Three trains were delayed when agitationists blocked the route for two-and-a-half hours from afternoon at the Gonda-Kachehri station to protest against the scrapping of the Devi Patan commissionery.

ACM (NER) DK Srivastava said that while passenger train number 594 was delayed at Burwal for 30 minutes, train 2556 Gorakhdham was stopped at Jarwal Road for 35 minutes.

Similarly, train 5064 Awadh Express was also held up at the Karnal Ganj station for 35 minutes.

Special drive: During a special drive to check passengers travelling without ticket, the North Eastern Railways (NER) caught 10 passengers who had been allowed to travel in the railway mail service (RMS) coach in three different trains.

ACM (NER) DK Srivastava said that the passengers had been allowed by the mail guards and the mail man of the respective trains. While in train number 5008 Gorakhnath Express, mail guard Mithai Lal and mail man Om Prakash Mishra had allowed three passengers to travel in the RMS coach, in the 5003 Chauri-Chaura Express, the mail guard Phool Chand Gupta and the mail man Anil Kumar Singh had let four passengers to travel in the RMS coach.

6,CM's no to simultaneous polls,"LUCKNOW: Will UP go to the polls along with the Lok Sabha in April-May? No, according to chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, who even tries to dispel all doubts on this count by asserting that unlike the vote-on-account proposed to be taken up by the Centre, he will have a full-fledged budget session of the assembly from February 4.

But, after five months in office, Yadav''s government is dogged by speculations about mid-term assembly elections, despite the fact that Yadav is currently busy seeking election from Gunnaur assembly constituency, slated to be held on January 24.

The most forthright in his view is state BJP president Vinay Katiyar, who predicts the fall of the government due to its internal contradictions. ""We are ready for the assembly polls as well, as they are certain,"" he said, adding that ""I cannot explain more than this at this point of time.""

As far as numbers go, Yadav is comfortable having a formidable majority of over 240 on the floor of the assembly. The break-up is: Samajwadi Partyâ€”190, Congressâ€”16, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)â€”14, Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP)â€”4, two each of the CPM and the LCP and one of the Akhil Bharatiya Congress, besides at least over a dozen of total 16 independents.

The majority was secured by Yadav during the trial of strength on the floor of the House, after assuming office on August 28. However, the political situation is now set to change. And the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, which is expected any time now, has much to do with it.

It is after the dissolution of the Lok Sabha that the state will have realignment of political forces. Already, there is an indication that the Congress might go with the BSP and the RKP with the BJP. Significant in this context was the recent meeting of RKP leader Kalyan Singh with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Prior to this, Singh had also shown his differences with the Samajwadi Party on the issue of Council election from Aligarh. Likewise, the Lok Dal will go where its leader Ajit Singh thinks his political future will be more secure.

But, then, the cause of worry for Yadav is the writ petition filed by the BSP before the Allahabad High Court to challenge the merger of its breakaway group with the Samajwadi Party. The petition is also pending for a final judgment of assembly speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi.

Tripathi, who himself is a BJP man, is free to dispose of the petition, though at present he has taken the plea that he will take it up only after the high court judgment. And, once the split in the BSP is derecognised, Yadav can hardly retain his sway.

7,BJP leaders seek dismissal of government,"LUCKNOW: Alleging complete breakdown of the law and order machinery in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP on Monday sought dismissal of the Mulayam government on the ground that it was proving to be a threat to the people of the state and announced to restore disbanded districts and divisions, if it came back to the power in the state.

Submitting a memorandum to governor Vishnukant Shastri after holding a demonstration, about 127 party MPs and legislators from UP, including two Union ministers of state Ashok Pradhan and Chatrapal Singh, sought intervention of the governor alleging that the Mulayam government had failed to fulfil its constitutional obligations. ""Deterioration in law and order has created a constitutional crisis in the state. To divert the attention of the people, the Mulayam government has disbanded nine districts and four divisions. This has further fuelled the fire and the anger of the people was now bursting on streets,"" said party state chief Vinay Katiyar, declaring that the party would reverse the decision to scrap nine districts and four division, if came to back to power in Uttar Pradesh. ""Two of the ruling party ministers were in the wanted list of the police and order for attachment of property against one has also been issued. Cases of kidnapping, rape, atrocities on women and murders were on the rise. Police was failing to act as criminals were being given shelter from the government,"" alleged Katiyar.

Predicting fall of the Mulayam government by April 15, the BJP chief said that ""the Mulayam government is proving to be a threat to the people of the state and the party will ensure that its ''misrule'' must end"".

A former BJP minister and senior party MLA Ram Prakash Tripathi even went to the extent of charging a senior Samajwadi Party leader of giving protection to three dreaded gangs in the state. ""The leader is the kingpin who is behind sudden spurt in kidnapping cases in the state,"" he said.

Later, Union minister of state for IT and telecom Ashok Pradhan, who is the BJP MP from Khurja, met chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and submitted him a memorandum demanding review of the government''s decision to disband districts and divisions. Terming the Mulayam government''s decision arbitrary, Pradhan said that no criterion was adopted while disbanding districts and divisions. ""The decision was causing inconvenience to the people. The unrest may turn more violent if the government did not review its decision,"" he said.

8,"Vajpayee cancels trip, polls likely by April","NEW DELHI: The possibility of the next general elections being held in the second half of March or the first half of April increased substantially on Monday.

The Prime Minister cancelled his foreign trip slated for the second week of February, two days after parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj announced the convening of a special session of Parliament from January 29 to pass the vote-on-account.

Sources added that the Lok Sabha may be dissolved immediately after the passage of the vote-on-account on February 5.

State elections could be held simultaneously in Andhra Pradesh â€” where the assembly has been dissolved â€” and in Orissa â€” where a decision on calling early elections will be taken by January 28.

The BJP had hoped to hold assembly elections in Maharashtra as well, but with the NCP sticking with the Congress there, it is unlikely.

The PM, who was to attend the BIMST-EC summit in Phuket, Thailand, and then fly to Australia for a bilateral meeting, official sources said, rang up Thailand''s PM on Saturday to say he would not be able to attend the summit on February 8-9 because of ""a number of domestic preoccupations"".

On Monday morning, Thailand''s PM called back to say that the other BIMST-EC leaders â€” Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka â€” with whom he had discussed the matter ""felt that it would be inappropriate to proceed with the summit under these circumstances"".

It was, therefore, decided to postpone the summit to ""a mutually convenient date, to be fixed through diplomatic channels"".

10,Politicians get down to mudslinging before polls,"MYSORE: It was a day of mudslinging for the politicians of Congress and Janata Dal(S) in Mysore city.

One another not only tried to smear each others faces, they tried to defend the alleged misdeeds of their bosses in the party.

At a series of press meets held one after another here on Tuesday, while Congress leaders tried to expose the land scams allegedly involving JDS leaders, JDS leaders made an effort to counter the allegations of Congress leaders, besides accusing Congress leaders of intimidating them.

At the first press meet it was Congress leaders against Congress leaders. Former Mayors T B Chikkanna, B K Prakash, Women''s wing president Latha Mohan and other MUDA members went hammer and tongs at their own corporator colleague M C Chikkanna and sought his expulsion from the party for allegedly exposing the irregularities in MUDA which is headed by Sandesh Nagaraj a Congress leader.

It has become habit for M C Chikkanna to criticise party leaders and help the rival party politicians, said T B Chikkanna, alleging him of being hand in glove with Dal politicians. Even one of the leaders threatened to stage dharna infront of KPCC chief Janardhan Poojariâ€™s residence if M C Chikkanna was not thrown out of the party.

These leaders termed all the claims and allegations made against MUDA officials and authorities were false and concocted and said it is a tactic by Chikkanna to come out with such false allegation to cover up his failures as a corporator.

However they remained silent when reporters wanted to know why they are holding a brief on behalf of MUDA chairman and officials against whom M C Chikkanna had levelled charges are keeping quiet on the allegations.

At the second press meet, it was again Congress leaders who came out with an allegation against JDS leader Dr. Yoganna that he has produced false documents and information to MUDA in 1988 to get allotted a Civic Amenity(CA) site for constructing a hospital.

Congress leaders H A Venkatesh, former ZP president B M Ramu and others who produced the correspondence between MUDA and Dr Yoganna demanded the government to cancel the allotment and initiate legal action against JDS leader.

They accused that Dr Yoganna way back in 1988 got allotted a land measuring about 4066 Sq.mts. in Ramakrishnanagar area claiming that land is needed for a registered institution indulged in social service.

â€œ It is surprising that letter head given to MUDA seeking the site contains the names of noted persons from Mysore city besides the names of a couple of journalists â€�they said , adding that MUDA authorities have neither verified the documents of the concerned institution nor the authenticity of the claim made by the applicant. â€œOne wonders how these noted persons and Journalists have used their influence to get a site worth in crores allotted to a non-existing institutionâ€� they said.

In addition to it, Dr. Yoganna also secured the bit of land attached to this site by using their influence, Congress leaders said accusing Dr.Yoganna has blatantly violated the rules and regulations related to allotment of CA sites.

In the third press meet, it was Dr. Yoganna himself who not only tried to defend the allotment , he even accused Congress leaders including district minister H.Vishwanath of victimizing him and other JDS leaders to settle political scores.

Dr Yoganna along with other JDS leaders said Vishwanath and his cronies in the district are behind this mudslinging campaign . â€œ As Vishwanath is losing his grip over the constituency , he has become panic over his political future and instigating his supporters against meâ€� he alleged adding that he has purchased the land from MUDA on outright sale .

â€œThere is nothing irregular or illegal in the allotment as the site is being used to construct a hospitalâ€� he added.

He even complained of receiving threatening telephone calls and said he has lodged a complaint with Mysore police in this regard.

11,Congress MLAs for simultaneous polls in Maharashtra,"MUMBAI: Expressing apprehension that NCP president Sharad Pawar might renege on his electoral pact with the Congress after the Lok Sabha polls, a majority of Congress legislators in Maharashtra on Tuesday strongly advocated simultaneous elections in the state.

Till December 2003, the department received 9.78 lakh returns out of which 6.61 lakh have been processed and refunds issued. He said that the department was committed to process returns within four months from the date of filing. Speaking about permanent account number (PAN), Tulsyan stated that after the job was outsourced to UTI from July last, 1.04 lakh PAN have been issued. Before that the department had issued 15.91 lakh PAN. People can find out the status of their PAN applications on website www.incometaxindia.gov.in he said adding that UTI was issuing PAN in three weeks after receipt of application.

Speaking about the e-TDS arrangements, Tulsyan said that from Monday all TDS deductors have to file the data in electronic form through a CD. The CD will be downloaded in the computer system of the department. The job of accepting e-TDS has been outsourced to National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) which has opened 41 tax information network (TIN) facilitation centres all over the country including three in Pune. In view of these changes the last date for filing e-TDS has been extended to March 31, 2004, he stated.

When asked about sending tax refunds directly to banks, Tulsyan said that the system could not succeed since people were reluctant to give their bank account numbers fearing that they would be used for investigations. Refunds can also be electronically sent to banks but the banks have said that they will not accept them unless a list of minimum 500 persons was sent.

Answering a question about the IT departmentâ€™s role in investigat-ing export sugar scam, Tulsyan said that the matter was pending before excise department tribunal as the sugar exporters have claimed that they have exported the sugar. â€œThe position is far from clear but if we find that sugar factories have earned excess money in the transaction they will have to pay taxâ€�, he clarified.

He also stated that the IT department was in constant touch with special investigating team (SIT) and other investigating agencies probing the fake stamp paper racket but declined to divulge more information saying that the matter was subjudice.
