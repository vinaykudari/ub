8,NHRC denies backing terrorism law,"new delhi: though sources at the national human rights commission (nhrc) denied reports that president k r narayanan had consulted nhrc chairperson justice j s verma before giving his assent to the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), they admit that the two did discuss the matter. ``actually, justice verma had gone to invite the president for human rights day which falls on december 10. president narayanan casually asked justice verma about the bill. he was never called for any discussion,'' says the source. on the other hand, justice verma, without getting into this bit of controversy, confirmed that he is yet to get a copy of poto. ``we have been trying but without any luck,'' he said. the commission has been at the forefront of opposition against the new law. in fact, last year when the law commission had sent a draft of this bill to the nhrc, the latter had noted that the commission ``regrets its inability to agree with the opinion of the law commission in its 173rd report and recommends that a new law based on the draft pot bill 2000 be not enacted.'' senior officials of the commission are surprised that the nhrc has been brought into the picture after a categorical denial. ``we still maintain that the existing laws are enough to contain terrorism. they need to be implemented forcefully,'' a commission official says.
