3,"No VAT before Oct, says minister","rajahmundry: the state government will not implement value added tax (vat) in the im-mediate future, certainly not before october, said the state finance minister y ramakrishnudu. in an informal meeting with the media rajahmundry on friday, he said though the state government, in principle, was committed to im-plement vat, it could not go ahead before october this year due to certain technical reasons. he said andhra pradesh was not the only state to postpone the introduction of vat. he said there were several other states like karnataka, tamil nadu, maharashtra and orissa which expressed their inability to implement vat immediately. the finance minister said imple-mentation of vat would help the state earn more revenue in the long run. he felt that all states should implement vat simultaneously lest it would re-sult in diversion of trade and commerce re-sulting in ad-verse impact on the states' economies. this was one of the reasons why andhra pradesh government decided to wait for some more time for imple-menting vat, he added. referring to the economic situa-tion, ramakrishnudu said the na-tional as well as state economies were in recession following which the revenue receipts of both of them were not as expected. this has created an adverse impact on the economic situation both at the centre and the state. commenting on the world bank findings that there was a paradigm shift from the indus-trial-based economy to agriculture-based economy, which was more suitable to the indian conditions, he said in the wake of the experi-ences of industrial-based economies of the west, adopting agriculture-based economy with indigenous inputs would be more beneficial for the state. the finance minister said that he had stressed upon the same in a recent meeting with the union finance minister. replying to a question, he said as far as additional revenue genera-tion was concerned, the central government was prepared to shift about 51 subjects from central list to the state list in the indian con-stitution. he said the earlier proposal of bringing certain heads of taxes into the concurrent list for the benefit of the state was still under consid-eration. the union ministry of law, he said, had raised certain ob-jections in the matter. procrastination no vat atleast until october technical reasons cited other states also not adopted

5,Bihar govt move to prune current plan,"patna: with the centre reducing bihar's share in the central taxes by rs 64 crore per month for the last four months and its own additional resource mobilisation also falling short of the target, the state government has been forced to initiate steps for pruning the size of its current annual plan ending in march. the state finance department made a suggestion to this effect to the planning and development department a few days ago. how much the state government is dependent on central assistance to sustain its annual plan can be gauged from the fact that out of the rs 2,644-crore annual plan for 2001-2002, the quantum of central assistance is expected to be rs 2,005.32 crore. the state government has suffered a cut of more than rs 250 crore in the central assistance during the last four months due to international developments. the union finance ministry had given sufficient hints to this effect to the bihar government in september itself, saying that it would have to reduce central assistance to the state as its revenue collection had started falling due to international developments. a top functionary of the government said that the union finance ministry has already rejected bihar's demand for rs 108 crore for 2000-2001 for panchayats in the light of the recommendations of the 11th finance commission due to delay in holding of panchayat polls. it is also unlikely to get rs 26 crore from the centre for urban development bodies for the years 2000-2002 due to delay in holding of urban local bodies polls. a senior planning department official, however, said that the state government is still pressing its demands and that chief minister rabri devi discussed the issue with planning commission member n k singh on wednesday. with the centre objecting to certain provisions of the bihar finance bill and the subsequent delay in presidential assent to the bill, the state government's plan to mobilise an additional resource of rs 250 crore during the year suffered a major setback leaving it with no option than to prune the annual plan size. top officials of the planning department on wednesday indicated that the annual plan size is likely to slashed down to about rs 1,825 crore from the rs 2,644 crore approved by the planning commission four months ago. the revised plan size will, however, be announced only after the planning department discusses the issue with all the 40 departments in next 15 days. the planning department officials said that the government would see to it that the core schemes of any department are not affected by it, adding that the government has spent only about rs 600 crore during the first six months of the current financial year. the slashing of the size of the current annual plan would also tell on the overall performance of the government during the 10th five-year plan ending in march. if the plan performance of the government during the last five years is any indication, it is unlikely to attain even 80 per cent of the five-year plan target of rs 16,680 crore.

7,Hill station hoteliers call off proposed bandh,"mumbai: the maharashtra hill station hotels and restaurants federation (mhshrf) has called off the proposed bandh of all hotels and restaurants at the hill stations of matheran.mahabaleshwar, panchgani and panhala. the `indefinite bandh' was scheduled to commence from january 14 and has been withdrawn after the state government `promised' to waive the enhanced water charges.mahendra thacker, chairman of the federation told this newspaper on friday that the government has planned to reduce the increased water charges and has asked the municipalities to ``take over'' and operate the water supply schemes at the hill stations. a delegation of the hoteliers and federation members met minister of rural development and water supply r.r. patil recently demanding the lowering of water charges.an official of the federation had termed the 120 per cent hike in water charges as ``unreasonable.'' ``at present the tourism sector is reeling under recession and the industry would be unable to bear the burden of hiked tariff'', he said. as per the old tariff, the users were charged rs 39.75 per thousand litres but that was hiked to rs 87 for thousand litres.the water schemes at the hill stations are managed by the maharashtra jeevan pradhikaran (mjp). `` actually the mjp's mandate is not to run the schemes but to design and construct them.'', a senior government official said. the municipal bodies at the hill stations have been reluctant to take over the water supply systems at the hill stations. despite the state government's financial backing, the mjp runs into losses of around rs 50 lakhs a year and that the revision of charges will not wipe out the losses, he said.the municipalities of matheran and mahabaleshwar are likely to take over the schemes soon, mr thacker said. mr patil was not available for comment.

8,HC directs Pune civic body to hold polls,"mumbai: in a significant order, the bombay high court on thursday directed pune municipal corporation to hold elections as per schedule on february 10, 2002. the order smoothened the road for the pune elections after almost a month of uncertainty in the wake of petitions challenging the exclusion of 20 villages from the pune civic limits. a plea for a stay of the order was refused.a bunch of petitions had challenged a maharashtra government notification dated november 17, 2001, which excluded 20 villages from the purview of pune municipal corporation (pmc) jurisdiction. a petition filed by a pune corporator challenged the government's decision on the grounds that pmc was not taken into consideration and a proper hearing was not given.the notification to exclude the 20 villages was issued after the election process had begun and delimitation of wards was carried out. hence the question arose as to how the pmc election ought to proceed and on what basis. a division bench headed by justice r.m. lodha on thursday accepted advocate general goolam vahanvati's submission that election be held in the 38 wards which were unaffected by the exclusion of the villages. only ten wards were affected by the exclusion of the 20-odd villages for which elections will be carried out by march 14 after completing the delimitation process once again. the pmc is divided into 48 wards and has 146 corporators.the court did not find favour with the election commission's (ec) contention put forth by its counsel c.j. sawant that the court had no jurisdiction to interfere in the matter now as the election process had already begun. the former advocate general sawant said the state notification ought to be stayed as reworking the ward delimitation would take time and as per constitutional mandate the election process had to be completed by march 14, 2002. the ec is likely to appeal the hc order in the supreme court on monday.in the hearing which lasted for four hours, vahanvati however noted that the ec sought a stay of the government notification only because it was more convenient for the commission. he also cited a sc judgment of 1989 where it was held that principles of natural justice did not apply when it came to the function of legislation and all that the court could do was to see that proper procedure was followed before a decision was taken.the bench, therefore, said it was not staying the government's impugned notification, but was only admitting all petitions which included some which supported the government decision.vahanvati also argued that if elections were permitted for all the wards inclusive of those covering the 20 villages, a situation could arise where the corporators who got elected would have to cease holding office if the notification was held to be valid later. if such an election was held it would be a futile exercise and a complete waste of public funds, he said. he argued that a fair solution had to be found which would be legal as well as equitable.earlier the court had asked all parties to come up with concrete suggestions to resolve the problem of reworking the delimitation of wards. however, the state said efforts to get the ec to work out a joint solution yielded no response.in 1997, 38 peripheral villages were included in the pmc limits. on november 17, 2001, a notification was, however, issued by the government deleting 15 villages and parts of five more from the pmc jurisdiction.justifying its decision to exclude the villages, the government also said that the whole purpose of including the villages in the pmc limits was not met with as there was hardly any implementation of civic amenities despite a high tax being collected from the villagers.the government noted that ``large chunks of irrigation land has been shown as reservation for software par, central business district, housing and other purposes. such large scale diversion of prime agricultural land for non-agricultural use would be a dangerous step.'' the state's theory now is that ``urbanisation at the cost of agriculture should be avoided at all costs.''

9,Police retracts after arresting 28-yr-old,"mumbai: on january 8, the borivli police arrested 28-year-old sagar kapadia for allegedly murdering his grandfather ratanshi sampat (74) and produced him before a magistrate, who remanded him to 15 days' custody. the murder was committed on the night of january 1 and the police tried to prove that it was an ``inside job''. on january 11, the police say kapadia is innocent and discharge him from the case! the police now claim that they have arrested the ``real culprits''.despite the major goof-up, which has traumatised sagar, the police insist that they have done no wrong. ``had we not arrested sagar, we could have never traced the killers. sagar helped us solve the case,'' additional police commissioner madhu shinde reasoned in a rather convoluted way.but was sagar's arrest necessary? ``sometimes, we need custody of a person to interrogate him at length. under section 169 of the crpc, we can always discharge such suspects after they are found innocent,'' he said. it remains unclear how sagar will be able to clear his image, considering the fact that he has spent two days in police custody and the news of his arrest for the murder of his grandfather has been flashed prominently in the media.``such actions on the part of the police causes irreparable damage and loss of reputation,'' said criminal lawyer majeed memon. ``it also affects the victim's psychological state and social status. the police while acting in a hurry has ruined somebody's life. such rash action deserves to be condemned. sagar should challenge his arrest in court.'' memon said it was a violation of a supreme court mandate (jogendra kumar v/s state of uttar pradesh) stating that the police should have adequate evidence before arresting a person. ``they cannot encroach upon anyone's personal liberty without having concrete evidence against him or her.''said another lawyer, requesting anonymity: ``for certain government formalities, sagar may be required to produce a police clearance since his name has appeared in the police records.'' deputy commissioner s.s. kemkar was, however, nonchalant when he said that sagar was always ``welcome'' to the borivli police station to demand a certificate of his innocence.kemkar insisted that sagar's arrest was ``technically correct''. ``we had some evidence which pointed towards at sagar,'' he said. ``but on interrogating him, we found him clean. but he helped us arrest the killers, one of whom was a neighbour of the deceased.''the neighbour, ashwin gohil (28), a builder hailing from a respectable family, ``confessed to the crime'' during grilling by the police on january 10. unlike the earlier murders of senior citizens, where the motive was robbery, this murder had a unique motive. the killer allegedly wanted to steal a licenced .32 bore webley & scott revolver belonging to the elderly person, the police said.said shinde: ``ashwin wanted the revolver to commit another murder along with his associate dharma tevar (32), who has also been arrested. tevar has a previous record of murder and extortion. the duo, along with a third person who is still to be arrested, approached the senior citizen at his flat on the night of january 1. when the old man refused to give them the revolver, they gagged him with a pillow.``the trio searched the house for the revolver, but in vain. finally, they made good their escape with some jewellery,'' shinde claimed. the police recovered the firearm from the kitchen cabinet, which was not touched by the killers. asked why sampat had kept a licensed revolver, shinde said: ``he had procured the weapon from his father.''during their investigations, the police had come across a local resident who had seen some persons entering sampat's residence on the fateful night. ``the description of one of the persons matched that of sagar, which is why we arrested him on suspicion,'' said an investigating officer.``it was difficult to interrogate sagar for over 24 hours as that would have meant illegal detention. we had no option but to arrest him and seek his custody. it helped us solve the sensational case,'' the officer said.

10,"Cotton growers stage rally in Rajkot, seek urgent relief","rajkot: nearly 400 cotton growers in the region staged a protest rally from kisanpara to the cci office on friday and submitted a memorandum to cotton corporation of india branch manager here. they wanted remunerative prices. the rallyists later made a bonfire of the statement in front of the cci office and demanded that cotton purchase begin immediately at all places, immediate payment for the cotton, direct purchase of cotton from the grower without involving the middlemen and ensure adequate price was paid to the farmer. the farmers threatened to intensify their agitation. bholabhai patel, farm leader from ahmedabad, who led the rally stated that it was estimated that the cotton yield would be around 40 lakh bales but the crop was infected and the yield was 30 lakh bales. at the same time, the prices were slashed from rs 450 for 20 kg to rs 300 to rs 350 for 20 kg. the farmer was hit both ways, by way of lower yield and also by way of lower price. though 12 centres had been opened in saurashtra to procure cotton, only 7,171 bales were purchased - 6,665 at the market rate and only 506 bales at the support price. patel alleged that last year 40 lakh bales were procured from saurashtra and that too when the production was half. this year the production was more but the purchase by cci was less. patel said that while union agriculture minister ajit singh had assured farmers that purchases would be made according to support price, the local branch of cci had not done so. so they had to come out on the street.

12,Police contradicts minister's version in kidnap-rape case,"gandhinagar: the kidnap and rape of a koli girl on december 17 in khambhala village - about 10 km away from the famous hanuman temple at sarangpur in ranpur taluka of ahmedabad district - has taken a curious turn with the police investigating into incident delaying its final report on it despite instructions from gandhinagar. minister of state for home gordhan zadaphia says he expects a report by the weekend, while state fisheries minister purshottam solanki, a koli, insists there is ""nothing to 0investigate"". the case took a political turn early this week when purshottam solanki, a vote-catcher for the bjp among kolis supported by other obc party mlas and community leaders, barged into the home minister's cabin asking for immediate re-arrest of the four accused set free by the local police. now, vikas sahay, sp, ahmedabad (rural), investigating the case and submitting a report to the state government, has sharply contradicted minister solanki's version. ""first of all, it was not a gang-rape,"" he says. ""in fact, the fir filed by the girl's father on december 29 does not mention rape at all. it only says that the girl was abducted. later on, the statement by the girl taken by the police established it was a rape."" sahay further says: ""it is also clear that only one person had raped the girl and she was not gang-raped. others may have been involved in the abduction. the accused, ramjibhai bachubhai, also belonging to the khambhala village, is in police custody along with one more man. others have been set free on bail. further, the girl is not a minor, as claimed by the minister. she is not 15 but 19."" solanki was away at mumbai, hence not available for comment.

13,Rongji visit may seal China's policy,"new delhi: the visit by chinese prime minister zhu rongji will be a crucial factor in shaping the current phase of indo-pakistani relations. officials expect the visit, the first by a chinese premier in a decade, to substantially alter the impression of china's tilt towards pakistan. though china has a longstanding relationship with pakistan and close military ties, it has not sided with either country in the current stand-off between india and pakistan, sources pointed out. official sources said notwithstanding pakistan's claims of having secured china's support, china had actually told pakistan to defuse tensions and affirmed that it had ties with both countries. pakistan president musharraf had flown into kathmandu for the saarc summit aboard a chinese plane, a move that was being seen as an attempt to signal chinese backing for pakistan. the visit by rongji, officials hope, will seal china's hands-off policy towards the ongoing diplomatic conflict. while officials have made no bones about the fact that contentious and delicate issues relating to the border and china's military aid to pakistan will figure in rangji's talks in new delhi, they stress that the visit will have a major economic component with cooperation in the area of science and technology. rongji will be accompanied by the minister for foreign trade and economic cooperation and minister for labour and social security.

15,"Flop bandh a verdict for Left, says CPM","siliguri: but for a few minor incidents, the 24-hour bandh called by the suci and the cpi(ml) on thursday was peaceful in the districts of north bengal. more than 900 cpi(ml) supporters, including its state leader avi ranjan majumder, son of former naxalite leader charu majumder, were arrested. in darjeeling, jalpaiguri, coochbehar and the two dinajpore districts, the presence of cpi(ml) and suci agitators was significantly low. while the cpi(ml) took out processions in all the district towns in support of the bandh, the cpm organised rallies opposing it. while most government offices in the towns had attendance figures much below normal, the scene was different in the outskirts and rural areas. tea gardens also registered near normal attendance. only a few buses were run by the north bengal state transport corporation. the national highways, too, were deserted as private vehicles hardly ventured out. police removed a road blockade on nh31 near ghoshpukur under darjeeling district. according to additional divisional railway manager (northeast frontier railway) h.k. singh, train services were normal all through from kumedpur on bengal-bihar border to srirampur on assam-bengal border. senior manager at bagdogra airport p.k. roy said that with normal attendance of the ground staff, flights took off and landed without any disruption. in siliguri, 40 leaders and supporters of the cpi(ml) were arrested during a procession. six policemen were injured in a clash with cpi(ml) supporters in dinhata subdivision, the coochbehar police superintendent said. a total of 340 persons, including 90 women, were arrested. north dinajpore police superintendent a. roy said that the situation in the district was normal, but cpi(ml) leader gouri dey claimed that state committee member from the district ajit das and 300 other supporters were arrested while holding a 'peaceful' demonstration. in jalpaiguri, about 200 cpi(ml) supporters, including state committee member sankar das, were arrested for trying to disrupt a meeting of engineers belonging to a left front-backed organisation. however, according to police sources, 'near normality' prevailed in the district. cpi(ml) leaders accused the cpm of using the police and the government machinery to ""smother democracy"" in west bengal and condemned the arrest of their supporters. countering this, the cpm claimed that the strike was a ""great flop"" and an ""anti-naxalite verdict"" of the people in favour of the ruling party.

17,Plea for policy decision on medical colleges,"patna: the medical education department has requested the government to take a policy decision with regard to filling the government quota seats in private medical and dental colleges of the state in the light of the supreme court order in the unnikrishnan case a few years back. this follows requests from private medical and dental colleges seeking to start post-graduate courses in different subjects. the katihar and kishanganj medical colleges have also been given government directive regarding the internship of the students obtaining mbbs degrees from these two colleges. the medical education department is, however, not in a position to take a decision on such matters, since the government is yet to recognise these institutions even though katihar and kishanganj medical colleges are recognised by the medical council of india (mci). both these colleges are supposed to fill about 30 seats each from government panel prepared on the basis of the results of the combined competitive entrance examination for admission into various technical institutions of the government. the dental council of india (dci) has recognised some private dental colleges. meanwhile, medical education and family welfare secretary afzal amanullah said that the government would fill all the vacant posts of professors, associate professors and assistant professors in the six medical colleges of the state by february by appointing retired teachers one-year on contract to meet the mci guidelines. bihar medical education and family welfare minister shakeel ahmad admitted that the department has requested the chief minister to take a policy decision on matters pertaining to private medical and dental colleges soon. he said that the department could not send its panel to these institutions without the prior permission of government as it would amount to granting them recognition. the minister, however, maintained that the private technical institutions should be allowed to grow in the background of bifurcation of the state. he said that a state like kerala received money orders (mos) worth rs 900 crore every year from the people obtaining jobs outside the state after obtaining degrees or diplomas from different private technical institutions of the state. he said that the issue would be discussed at a high level meeting soon. as of now, he said, about 75 posts of professors were lying vacant for the past several months in these colleges. amanullah said that the department had also initiated steps to amend the medical education rules, 1997, to fill the vacant posts of professors and associate professor by promotion.

19,State govt asks for World Bank aid,"kolkata: the west bengal government has asked for assistance from the world bank to implement its plan to reduce pressure of population on kolkata. state urban development minister ashok bhattacharya discussed this with world bank in charge of transport and urban development john flora in a recent meeting. in the absence of an adequate all round development of small and medium sized towns in the state it has not been possible to stop the propensity of people to rush to the city- although kolkata bound traffic flows have certainly been stemmed somewhat lately. a wider range of educational and cultural facilities, better living standards and quality of life continue to make most bengalis as well as people from other eastern and north eastern states make heavy demands on kolkata's limited space and infrastructure. hence the urge of the government to upgrade facilities in the smaller towns to the metropolitan level, and contain migration to the city. it is learnt from official sources that flora has asked bhattacharya to submit a fully spelt out proposal to world bank officials in new delhi, and assured him that an expert team would be sent soon to discuss the proposal with the state government. the final clearance would however depend, however on the economic affairs department of the union finance ministry. meanwhile at a recently held three-day conference held in kolkata under the auspices of the cities alliance( a world bank sponsored organisation and the british government), representatives from 30 countries including brazil, south africa, thailand and malaysia exchanged experiences of third world countries in tackling urban growth . a data bank was proposed to be built up, a senior official of the urban development department said. ""we intend to work together in many fields and will use the experiences of big cities elsewhere to solve kolkata's problems."" help of the world bank and other international bodies was also expected for improving district towns in the state. here too experience sharing would be essential, the official added.

20,RJD’s plan for UP polls in jeopardy,"patna: the continuation of rjd chief laloo prasad yadav behind bars has put the party plan to contest in the ensuing up polls in jeopardy. there are several persons coming from up, who want to contest the election on rjd ticket, stated party spokesman shivanand tiwari. he, however, did not comment on the number of seats likely to be contested by the rjd in the up polls. rjd sources indicate that the congress stand that it will go alone in up has come as a setback. incidentally, aicc president sonia gandhi, in her public speech in up on thursday, made it clear that the congress is in no mood for alliance with any party. we had hoped to contest the up polls in alliance with the congress since we have such an alliance in bihar, said an rjd leader, adding that the reports hinting that laloo and priyanka will jointly hold election rallies are false. though the rjd has no stake in up, it had hoped to make its entry with the congress carrying it piggyback. ""the status of rjd in up is the same as that of the samajwadi party in bihar. in the bihar assembly elections, aspirants failing to get ticket from any other party contested on samajwadi party ticket. in up, the rjd will play the same role,"" conceded a former rjd minister. the past experience of the rjd has proved that laloo may be a crowd puller in up but votes completely elude him as the track record indicates that in the last assembly polls in up, the rjd got just 0.14 per cent of votes for the seats it had contested. as laloo's future is uncertain with the jharkhand hc rejecting him bail in a case, the rjd is unable to decide its course of action in the up polls. but even in the past, laloo never showed any interest in expanding the rjd base beyond bihar's boundary, and its ""national meet"" is full of obscure persons presented as unit presidents of different states.

21,Sabotage not ruled out in Bikaner ordnance fire,"bikaner: sabotage was not ruled out in the fire that devastated 80 ammunition trucks of an army convoy near here on friday as defence minister george fernandes visisted the site and said that this aspect would also be probed by the comprehensive court of inquiry orderded into the mishap. fernandes, who made an on-the-spot inspection of the fire site along with rajasthan chief minister ashok gehlot on saturday morning, said that gehlot also suspected sabotage behind the incident. a series of explosions in the 250-strong convoy carrying tank ammunition to forward formations claimed two lives and destroyed 1000 tonnes of ammunition laid atop 80 trucks, which were completely gutted. fernandes and gehlot spent over two hours going round the mishap site, accompanied by top ordnance experts, hours after leaping flames from ammunition trucks had been doused by over 30 civil and army fire tenders. the two leaders also visited the nearby villages, where large number of people who had fled in panic were returning to their homes. according to initial reports, highly placed army sources here said that an electric spark in one of the 250 civil trucks hired to move heavy ammunition from bhatinda in punjab to ganganagar-bikaner in northern rajasthan frontier had triggered massive explosions in the parked convoy gutting as many as 80 ammunition trucks. the convoy was part of the movement orderded in connection with the operation parakrama, as the current army mobilisation is codenamed. the convoy was parked in an army cantonment bay for a short rest when a truck caught fire and the bursting ammunition engulfed all the nearby trucks. huge explosions echoed round the area with flames leaping as high as 60 to 70 feet sending hundreds of villagers living around the area fleeing in panic. top army and civil officials, who rushed to the spot, managed to get the 170 ammunition-laden trucks comprising the bulk of the convoy, to drive away to safety as fire tenders were pressed into service. the sabotage theory had come to surface as the pattern in the mishap was the same as what happened near the suratgarh ammunition depot last year, army officials said. at suratgarh, an army ammunition convoy carrying tank ammunition after joint indian air force and army exercise 'operation poorna vijay' had caught fire gutting over 2000 rounds of armoured ammunition. a court of inquiry into the incident is yet to submit its report. friday's incident incidentally is the third major fire near a forward ammunition depot in the ganaganagar-pathankot-bikaner belt. a mysterious fire at mamoon near pathankot towards the end of 2000 had gutted large volumes of tank ammunition after conclusion of forward armoured exercises. security officials said that there had been reports of intrusion by pakistani agents in these border belts and over the past three years a number of arrests had been made.

23,FEAR alleges backdated selection,"patiala:the forum for educational action and reform (fear) in its meeting, here, on friday, strongly criticised punjabi university vice-chancellor for making the back dated appointment of an ad hoc employee, bs mann, to the professors' grade. the vc had reportedly reactivated the national integration chair kept in abeyance by the syndicate due to non-availability of funds.the funds were being contributed by two chandigarh institutions, swraj tractors and punjab alkalis. releasing a press note, here, friday, forum president amarjit singh dhillon said that they felt that the appointment, which dated back to december 24, 2001, was an attempt to hoodwink the election commission whose model code of conduct was enforced on december 26, 2001. this, he said, was clear from the appointment letter. the telephone number, the release said, was of the registrar and not the university establishment branch. the vc, the release added, had announced at a function, held during december end, to honour america-based baba daljit singh that starting january 1, 2002, bs mann would be in the professors' grade.the vc need not have mentioned the clause that the appointment was subject to the decision of the election commission. the vc said that he did not have the time to react to the baseless and irresponsible statements of fear. be neutral, says dc deputy commissioner vikas partap, on friday, directed district officials to play a neutral and impartial role during the elections.while addressing the meeting of district officers at bachat bhawan, he warned officers not to run away from election duty. once deputed, he said, they will be held responsible, adding, no duties would cancelled. the dc said that if any official was found misusing his position during the election, he would be dealt in accordance with the rules of the ec.

24,Industrialist adopts government Urdu school,"bangalore: having been playing angel to the nondescript government urdu model primary boys' school, he finally decided to come out in the open and adopt it. meet ashraf pasha, the industrialist of the area who had been pumping in some rs 2.5 lakh every year for more than a decade to see that the students get basic amenities required for studying in the school situated in islampur near hal: wooden plank, crisp white uniform with thin blue stripes. once the basic amenities were met, the kindergarten children were all attention hanging on to every word of the teacher. the medium of instruction is urdu no doubt, yet the school caters to children from various communities and religious groups up to class vii. the apparent negligence of the government for over a decade had left the school tottering and help from the government was limited to providing textbooks free and salary to the teachers. after the behind-the-scene philanthropic activities, pasha on saturday adopted the school officially. with pasha at the helm, each student can now be assured of two sets of uniform and free midday meal on occasions. classrooms have been fitted with fans and lighting fixtures. economically poor sections of the society, whose children make a major chunk of school students, have been advised not to let their children labour in the sun. send them to school instead, he says. ashraf pasha's son chand pasha, who is on the school committee, says: ""now teachers cannot go on leave for more than seven days without our permission unlike earlier when they used to chronically absent themselves."" the school is located inside a mosque. ""the government has not paid rent to the mosque for a long time,"" says chand pasha. the school plans to start higher secondary in a few years.

25,"New law, old problems","new delhi: delhi police have begun partying. for once, let's spoil it. suggest they tone down their euphoria. maybe temper the doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom. remind them that a new, more stringent law is simply akin to a users' manual for a more advanced gadget. someone still needs to read the fine print, press the correct keys and understand its features well for it to work. it won't start solving our problems on its own. the maharashtra control of organised crime act (mcoca), a law recently extended to delhi, hence, doesn't mean the end of extortions, abductions and gangs. it's simply a means. fighting crime will still need better investigating skills, knowledge and the ability to use the new law. solid evidence will still decide whether an accused ends-up paying a price for the terror unleashed by him or her. and on all these three fronts, the delhi police have a gloomy record. which is precisely why the euphoria must end. there are umpteen illustrations of faux pas, shoddy probe skills, scanty knowledge of law and technique and overall lack of application to supplement this. which is why our police must keep this new crime busting tool and their smiles aside, brush-up their basic investigating skills and work long and hard on the nitty-gritty. take july 22, 1997, as one such day they ignored a seemingly trivial matter. even before the city had woken up from its early morning slumber, golf links had been unsettled by a gang of kidnappers, who whisked away nine-year-old tarun puri from outside his home. they fired a few shots as well. any police force would have looked at it as an opportunity for bullets mean evidence...a link to suspects. but not the new delhi district. they combed the area but only as a routine, not an opportunity. they missed a particular empty bullet, which later turned out to be the key in cracking the case. this empty bullet belonged to an ak-47 automatic, a weapon not many gangs could boast of then. luckily, the empty bullet had been spotted by a journalist and handed over to the police commissioner. the empty bullet turned out to be the key element which led them to the gang. but they didn't learn any lessons. not even while handling the high-profile murder of bandit queen phoolan devi. she was gunned down outside her official residence. political conspiracies did the rounds. the house should have been combed...and well. but even if they did it, they missed a locally-made weapon from inside one of the rooms — an unpardonable lapse for any professional force. that this had once happened in the past as well made things worse. a few days before navy day celebrations at the naval chief's house, a sensational case of an armed intrusion occurred in november 2000. again, it was a messy job of routine combing which caused an embarrassment. for, the police recovered some empty bullets, after the prime minister had left the house once the function was over. his visit ostensibly was preceded by a detailed, multi-agency combing and sanitising operation. that the intrusion was merely the outcome of a navy guard's story-telling skills shouldn't distract us from the shoddy effort. it this was about scanning the crime scene. they don't fare any better on understanding the value of evidence and using it for a solid case either. in september 2000, the police instantly returned a car to a person accused of raping a girl inside the moving vehicle. that they quickly took it back after the case was widely reported, reflected even poorly on the way our police investigates...and thinks. their report card on simple common sense and application of mind is full of red marks as well. in september 1998, a delhi police official reached the then air force chief s k sareen's ancestral residence on dehradun to ''verify his character and antecedents,'' and began grilling his family. the goof-up left the police red-faced and an inquiry revealed it had occurred merely because the officers in-charge of prime minister's security wanted everyone attending a function which included the pm verified, with their men taking it too literally. the only leveller in these umpteen examples of shoddiness is that they don't spare their own men either. delhi police commissioner ajai raj sharma, in may last year, had to ask south district police to apologise to a sub-inspector and a constable because their names were included in a list of policemen having links with criminals. apparently, the si shared his name with another officer who was supposed to be in the list. the constable, however, didn't even have this luck. why he became an accused remains a mystery. it happened again in february 1999. a robber had gagged a housewife and then committed the horrific crime of drowning her 13-month-old son in a bucket of water in south delhi's sukhdev vihar even as she watched. it was a crime which needed to be worked out fast to restore the confidence of a shaken city. the police ended up wasting several days trying to locate a car which they believed had been used by the suspect to escape, only to find it belonged to the cousin of an officer who was incharge of that very area's police checkpost. but let's not dismiss this as a mere attempt to be snippety. behind all these episodes lies a huge issue of investigations being unprofessional, officers not being trained and equipped to do a good job and seniors shying away from punishing bad work. that is why just mcoca shouldn't make us happy. the party should begin the day the law is used well...and fairly.
