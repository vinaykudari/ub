0,Arun Jaitley pulls out rulebook on elections,"NEW DELHI: Now that the Gujarat assembly has been dissolved, the BJP is trying to impress upon the Election Commission that it has no option but to call an election before October, so that the new assembly can be formed within six months of the last session in April.

On Friday, former law minister and BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley met Chief Election Commissioner L M Lyngdoh to give him the partyâ€™s â€˜â€˜legal angleâ€™â€™ on the issue.

According to BJP sources, Jaitley told Lyngdoh that the provisions of Article 356, which relates to imposition of Presidentâ€™s Rule in a state, did not apply as the dissolution had been done voluntarily by the state government and not followed a breakdown of the Constitutional machinery and, therefore, the arguments put forth by former Prime Minister I K Gujral and Justice Rajinder Sachar to the EC did not apply.

That left Article 324 and Article 174, Jaitley told Lyngdoh, adding that in his opinion, Article 324, which relates to the powers of the Election Commission in the conduct of polls, was circumscribed by Article 174, which says that there cannot be a gap of more than six months between two sittings of the assembly.

In other words, since the last session was in April, the next has to be in October, and therefore the elections must be held before that.

1,"New laws, police to stop vandals","NEW DELHI: City buses and even trains cannot escape the destructive prowess of vandals â€” sometimes scribbling on a love note in a railway compartment, at others using the vehicles as mobile advertisements or simply relishing the perverse thrill of defacing public property.

But any such activity at the Delhi Metro stations or aboard the train may land the perpetrator in serious trouble.

â€˜â€˜Anybody who vandalises Metro property will either end up paying a hefty fine, or may even have to spend a spell in prison, depending on the severity of the action. Serious crimes like sabotage may even invite death penalty,â€™â€™ said Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesperson Anuj Dayal.

Dayal said a legislation in this regard was being formulated. â€˜â€˜We have already submitted the proposal with the transport ministry. If it is cleared, the law will come into being as the Operation and Maintenance Act â€” an elaborate legislation that will take into account every aspect of running the Metro,â€™â€™ he said.

Apart from the legislation which may take some time to be formulated and implemented, DMRC has already rolled up its sleeves to tackle security at the six stations that are going to be opened first.

â€˜â€˜Besides technical reinforcement like earthquake-resistant tunnels and structures and state-of-the-art fire fighting systems, the other aspect will be civil security. For this we have tied up with the Delhi Police and a special squad is being formulated for the Metro,â€™â€™ Dayal said.

These personnel will set up a police station at Shastri Park where, incidentally, the Metroâ€™s central operational control centre is going to be located. â€˜â€˜One will be able to control operations at any Metro station from here, including the running of trains, ventilation and air conditioning,â€™â€™ said Dayal.

At the individual stations the police personnel will co-ordinate with the private security personnel to be identified as Metro Police. The Metro Police will be responsible for random checks at the stations. Close circuit televisions (CCTVs) installed in the stations will be connected to the central control centre, keeping a tab on all activity.

Officials say some of the CCTVs will have long-range vision and will be installed on the tracks. For its surface tracks, DMRC plans to construct a nine-feet high RCC wall, which will be difficult to breach. Barbed wires will be put on the wall to deter people from crossing over tracks. The CCTVs will also monitor the surface lines.

Bomb detecting equipment like special explosive vapour detectors, scanners and metal detectors will be installed, while sniffer dogs trained to identify explosives will help the Metro Police ward off terrorist strikes. All entry to the Metro stations will be through automatically controlled gates and an electronic access control system will permit only authorised personnel in the technical area and the maintenance depots. Cash rooms and unmanned technical areas will be protected by security alarm systems.

2,Modi announces increase in VUDA limits,"VADODARA: With elections round the corner, care-taker Chief Minister Narendra Modi came to the city with a bouquet of sops. Modi announced extension of city limits, a long-standing demand of Vadodara residents.

Modi was in the city to inaugurate the newly constructed VUDA Bhavan and address teachers on the occasion of the Shala Praveshotsav of the VMC school board. Addressing a gathering at VUDA Bhavan, Modi said the state government had cleared a decision regarding the increase in VUDA limits. Modi also took a dig at the Congress.

""Till now they had been chanting that we should resign. Now that we have done that they are not willing to face the people,"" he said. Modi alleged that the Congress had been deliberately trying to keep people in relief camps to create an impression that things in the state had not returned to normalcy.

3,'Cong govt's days numbered',"ALAMGIR, Ludhiana: Lashing out at Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, former chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Parkash Singh Badal on Sunday said that the Congress government would not last five months as it had failed on all fronts, causing widespread disillusionment.

Badal was addressing the first of a series of district-level party meetings held in Diwan Hall of gurdwara Manji Sahib, Alamgir, near Ludhiana. Apprehending further political victimisation, Badal said implication of Akali sarpanches in â€˜â€˜falseâ€™â€™ cases ahead of panchayat polls is the next item of the state governmentâ€™s anti-Akali agenda.

He said Amarinder had turned against him because he had rejected his request to allot an Akali ticket to contest the 1997 Punjab assembly polls. In the same manner, All India Shiromani Akali Dal president Gurcharan Singh Tohra, too, nursed a grudge against him, Badal said, adding, both these leaders had joined hands to finish him politically.

Referring to the two-pronged attack from these leaders, Badal also alleged Amarinder and Tohra had reached a secret understanding according to which the latter had supported Congress party during the recent assembly polls.

It was in accordance with the same understanding that as many as seven Congressmen were given tickets for the DSGMC elections, Badal further said.

Continuing his tirade, he said Congressâ€™ next move would be to usurp control of SGPC with Tohraâ€™s support since this institution was the centre of Akali politics.

â€˜â€˜But I will not let their nexus work,â€™â€™ Badal said. On the SGJC issue, he claimed his government had nominated those members who were recommended in the panel approved by Tohra. Now the same commission had been disbanded by Amarinder at Tohraâ€™s behest, Badal said.

Addressing a news conference, Badal reiterated that if the government was sincere in its resolve to root out corruption, it should immediately reopen the cases of former Congress ministers Shamsher Singh Dullo, Bal Mukand Sharma, Lakhmir Singh Randhawa and present finance minister Lal Singh, who had been indicted by the Lok Pal.

Taking a dig at the government for its â€˜â€˜double standards,â€™â€™ Badal said a former Punjab governor, who had set aside the Lok Pal recommendations for action against them, had now joined Congress.

Badal also said the district-level meetings planned by SAD to expose the government would be followed by public rallies at all district headquarters by the end of August.

4,"Modi, ministers go back to their constituencies","AHMEDABAD: Even as the co-ordination committee of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is scheduled to meet this weekend to chalk out the party''s poll strategy for the Assembly election, several ministers of the Modi government and members of the dissolved Assembly have reached their constituencies to reestablish contact with the electorate.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi himself had left for Rajkot after submitting a letter to Governor S S Bhandari seeking the dissolution of the Assembly to pave the way for fresh elections. Modi had entered the state Assembly from Rajkot-2 that was vacated for him by former finance minister Vajubhai Vala.

Though it is too early for Modi to decide from where he should try his luck in the ensuing Assembly elections, political observers feel that Modi may contest from the same constituency. During his one-day trip on Saturday the chief minister painstakingly gave the account of his 10-month tenure to the people of Rajkot city.

State industries minister Suresh Mehta was also amid his voters in Mandvi of Kutch district. He has been representing the constituency in the Assembly for the past two decades.

Among other functions held in the port town of Mandvi, Suresh Mehta inaugurated a Rotaract Club meet. Members of Rotaract clubs from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat took part in it.

Senior BJP leader Ashok Bhatt, who represents the urban Khadia constituency, was equally busy explaining people about the importance of ayurveda. More than 2,500 patients were examined by 50 experts led by Padmashree Devendra Triguna at a camp organised there on Sunday.

During a demonstration, Bhatt exhorted patients about the high medicinal value of ''tulsi'' leaves which he said should be grown in every house.

Anandiben Patel also visited her Mandal constituency in Ahmedabad on Saturday. She addressed workers'' conventions in three talukas of Ahmedabad district. State prohibition and excise minister Fakirbhai Vaghela was in Dasada constituency of Surendranagar district to tell his voters as to why elections were being held earlier than scheduled.

State water supply minister Narottam Patel is in Chorayasi, his home constituency in Surat district. He was welcomed by an enthusiastic group, some of them beating drums. Patel inaugurated a newly-constructed water tank at a small village near the taluka town of Chorayasi.

5,Undertrial commits suicide,"FEROZEPUR: With the death of an undertrial Rajiv (25), who allegedly hanged himself at the local central jail on Saturday night, a sense of insecurity has creeped among the rest of the undertrials and the prisoners lodged in the jail. Family members of the deceased allege foul play and accuse the jail authorities of the illtreatment that led to the untimely death of Rajiv.The jail authorities said Rajiv Bhatti had been in custody in an excise case since June 26, 2002. He was a drug addict and was referred to medical college, Faridkot for de-addiction on July 10. He returned to the jail after getting medical help on July 17 and since then he was perfectly alright. Rajiv hanged himself on Saturday night, they added. Mukhtiar Bhatti, father of the deceased, visited the jail on Sunday and said that there were bruises on his body. If my son hanged himself, then why were there bruises on his body, he asked. He said the jail authorities used to demand money from him for the upkeep of his son inside the jail.Notwithstanding the allegation made by the relative of the deceased, a jail official told Times News Network that Rajiv was a drug addict and was being treated for de-addiction and perhaps under some frustration he hanged himself. A postmortem was performed by a panel of three doctors in the presence of local SDM, and viscera of the body has been sent to the forensic laboratory at Patiala for determining the cause of the death.

6,Modi asks party workers to be ready for polls,"RAJKOT: Chief Minister Narendra Modi called upon party workers from his Rajkot-2 constituency to get ready for a ""battle royal"" with the Congress.

""No effort must be spared to demolish the Congress in the state"", he told BJP party workers during his brief stopover here on Saturday.

He asked his partymen to reach out to the interior areas of the state and highlight the achievements of the BJP government.

""As the Congress would try every trick in the trade to win the Assembly elections, it is for the party workers to give a befitting reply to Vaghela''s strategy"", Modi said, adding that the next two months were crucial for the party. Modi met party workers from all the wards and listened to their grievances.

Most of the party workers expressed their displeasure with the working style of senior leaders like Vijay Rupani and Vajubhai Vala.

Earlier, the computer-savvy chief minister announced his government''s plan for e-governance. Rajkot has been the first district after Banaskantha, where the system of e-governance has been introduced from Saturday. Through this, a person can dial 1505 and register his grievance directly with the chief minister''s office from where it would be directed to the concerned department. He said that a similar exercise had been tried in Banaskantha where almost 8,000 complaints were received, 70 of which were solved.

Similarly, the e-gram sabha had also evoked a good response as problems faced by people were addressed directly through video conferencing. A direct dialogue with the people has helped in better understanding of their problems, Modi said, adding that there were plans to set up facilities for tele medicine, which would go a long way in improving health facilities in the villages.

The state government has gone in for more employment-oriented schemes, where by the rural poor would be given employment. The concept of samras gam, Gokul gam, Gram sabha and Gram mitra are all schemes meant to uplift the standard of living in villages, he said.

7,Congress readies itself for Assembly polls,"AHMEDABAD: All those who thought that the problems of the Gujarat Congress have ended with the appointment of Shankersinh Vaghela as the state chief, might be quite off the mark.

The political arena is already agog with the verbal fisticuffs between Vaghela and Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

The signals are loud and clear that Gujarat is set to become the laboratory for yet another political party - the Congress, which shed its orthodox garb and appointed a leader uprooted from the enemy camp. If successful, this might usher in a strategy to be replicated in other non-Congress states, reveal sources. And the entire phenomenon will be observed closely, by the central leadership of the party through observers appointed to identify prospective poll candidates here.

On Monday, the Congress steering committee will put the party into poll gears to fight its battle against a potent Hindutva-fuelled saffron surge. But the biggest thorn in Vaghela''s flesh might still be former GPCC chief Amarsinh Chaudhary. The central Congress leadership tried to mollify him by thrusting on him the mantle that he had shed to become the party chief, but Chaudhary is obviously not happy. And he misses no chance to reveal this.

""If in the interest of the party, he successfully mobilises his supporters, then it is enough!"", observed a senior party leader. The superficial differences seem settled with all the leaders - Madhavsinh Solanki, Urmila Patel and Chaudhary having come around, but will this cementing process percolate to the lower rungs - is the dilemma that the Congress will have to handle.

Late though, but the party did realize that it needed to plug the gaping holes and don war paint to combat the BJP, which is being equally discreet about its moves. The appointment of observers is a promising step to ward off possibilities of factionalism surfacing in the nomination of candidates.

But party leaders are beginning to realize that they have very little time to spread this word and placate supporters of various factions, who might try to sabotage the forged unified front. There was a subtle statement in the impressive gathering that turned out to receive Vaghela on Thursday - that the minorities, too, were for the change, but how much of it would translate into votes is what matters now.

""Yes, initially, I did think that Vaghela''s appointment was badly timed, but later realised that it is better accepted in the greater good of the party"", quipped Urmila Patel.

9,Cong does not rule out free power for farmers,"HYDERABAD: Virtually endorsing the Congress promise for providing free power to farmers in the state, the Congress high command has said that the issue concerned the respective states and it is upto the governments to take a decision on that.

Brushing aside the criticism of TDP president and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu over the â€œdouble speakâ€™â€™ of Congress on the issue, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Vyalar Ravi has said that though the Congress as a national party had a generalised perception on the issue, he said the party is against subsidies, but the conditions and priorities vary from state to state and hence it is for the states to take a decision whether or not to provide free power to farmers.

â€œIf the state Congress is confident that it can sustain providing free power to farmers, the party high command will have no objections to it,â€™â€™ he said.

Quoting instances of different policies being adopted by different states like Kerala and Karnataka on the power sector, Ravi told reporters on Sunday that in Kerala for instance the Congress promise for free power upto one bulb is still being implemented.

In the same vein, he said that while Karnataka had its own compulsions on providing free power, the Congress government headed by Biju Patnaik in Orissa was the first in the country to privatise the power sector. â€œAs a national party we laid down some guidelines on the issues. But, we gave flexibility to the state to decide on priorities,â€� he said.

On Naiduâ€™s claims that Karnataka government was not giving free power and was in fact charging more compared to Andhra Pradesh, he said that if the chief minister was that keenly following Krishnaâ€™s policies, he could have left the government to the Congress.

10,TDP leader accused of violating FFW rules,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Telugu Desam Party (TDP),Visakhapatnam (rural) president and Visakha Dairy chairman Adari Tulasi Rao has been accused of misusing Food-for-Work (FFW) rice by issuing rice coupons and thereby violating rules.

The revenue officials on Saturday seized rice coupons with the signature of Tulasi Rao being distributed at Timmarajupet village in Munagapaka mandal in the district.

According to the rules, rice coupons for the FFW beneficiaries engaged in the construction of a veterinary hospital at Timmarajupet should be issued by the Munagapaka mandal parishad revenue officer (MRO).

The officials have no clue how Tulasi Raoâ€™s signature appeared in place of the MRO.

The Visakha Dairy has sanctioned a 30 per cent grant for the Rs 3 lakh hospital project, while the remaining 70 per cent is being met by the state government under the FFW programme.

The issue was brought to the notice of Munagapaka mandal revenue officer by locals who complained that Tulasi Rao was issuing rice coupons.

The MRO, who inspected the coupon books and found the dairy chairmanâ€™s signature on them, ordered stoppage of rice distribution immediately.

11,Naidu dares Cong to face Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: Adopting an aggressive stance, BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday dared the Congress to face his party in an early election in Gujarat, even as he rejected the demand for Presidentâ€™s Rule in the state.

He accused the Congress and the Left of adopting double standards and betraying â€˜â€˜weakness, nervousness and unpreparednessâ€™â€™, while praising chief minister Narendra Modi for his â€˜â€˜moral courage â€˜â€™ in dissolving the state assembly.

Addressing the Press here, Naidu countered the Congress demand by asking whether the Congress would like to have Presidentâ€™s Rule in Congress-ruled states, where elections are due next year. â€˜â€˜The Congress talks of idealism and ideology only when it is in the Opposition.â€™â€™

Naidu said the Congress had, for the past two months, been saying it was ready for elections in Gujarat. â€˜â€˜Now the state BJP says it is ready for elections, but you (Congress) are against it. What is the rationale behind this?â€™â€™ he questions.

12,Indian arrested in Hong Kong,"BEIJING: An Indian is among 17 suspected criminals arrested in Hong Kong for involvement in two transnational crime syndicates smashed by police, a report said on Monday.

The police raided over 20 places on Saturday night in Hong Kong, arresting five men and 12 women aged between 20 and 50 and seizing about Hong Kong $63,000 and US $2,000 in cash.

Initial investigations revealed besides the Indian, 13 Colombians and three Sri Lankans were arrested, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

They are suspected of being connected with seven theft cases which had occurred since May this year.

Senior superintendent and head of Interpol Hong Kong, China, Yu Mun-Wah said that the culprits used to divert the attention of victims by spraying liquid onto their clothes or tell the victims that some banknotes belonging to them had fallen from their bags.

14,Oppn demands President's rule in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: Set to dominate the rest of the monsoon session, the Gujarat issue rocked Parliament once again on Monday, with a determined Opposition forcing adjournment of both Houses demanding President''s rule in the state.

The issue will be debated by the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

The issue came up as soon as the two Houses assembled in the morning, with the Congress-led Opposition demanding that Question Hour be suspended to discuss the matter of ""prime national interest.""

They also sought an explanation from the government on why Central rule should not be imposed in Gujarat.

Senior Congress MPs Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi and Jaipal Reddy said there had been ``gross abuse and misuse of constitutional power"" in Gujarat, reiterating the party''s demand for President''s rule as a pre-requisite for elections.

Speaker Manohar Joshi quoted precedence to say that the only time the Question Hour was suspended was with the consensus of the entire House, but Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan said the government would answer the Opposition but only in the Zero Hour.

The Speaker made all efforts to control the fracas, even threatening action. The Question Hour continued amid the din of agitated Congress members - later joined by the Left, the RJD and the Samajwadi Party - who trooped into the well of the House shouting slogans.

The House was adjourned for two hours as soon as the Zero Hour began. It reassembled for a few minutes at 2 p.m. amid chaos only to be adjourned for the day.

The Rajya Sabha saw similar scenes and was adjourned for the day even earlier. The Gujarat issue will now come up for discussion under Rule 193 in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

The House, which was scheduled to discuss the drought situation on Tuesday, will now take that up on Thursday.

Though the discussion has been listed primarily to debate the relief and rehabilitation process in Gujarat, Opposition leaders said it would naturally spill over to include the latest developments like Narendra Modi''s move to have early elections in the state and the demand for President''s rule.

The Opposition would draw attention to the fact that relief and rehabilitation work was far from over in Gujarat with over three lakh refugees still languishing, awaiting rehabilitation, without even identity slips. The process of issuing identity cards begins only next month in Gujarat.

The issue has also brought together the Opposition, with the Samajwadi Party joining the Congress and Left members in trooping to the well of the House on Monday demanding Central rule in Gujarat.

On the other hand, even the NDA allies, who had made noises of dissent during the Gujarat debate the last time around, are now rallying around the BJP.

The Telugu Desam Party leader in the Lok Sabha, Yerran Naidu, who had led a walkout of party MPs just before the Gujarat issue was debated during the Budget session, told Times News Network on Monday: ""It is the prerogative of the CM to dissolve the House and go for elections. Ultimately the people are the best judge.""

The party is now saying that the situation in the state has considerably improved since three months ago.

17,Congress demands governor's rule in J&K,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday demanded imposition of governor rule in Jammu and Kashmir to hold free and fair elections where political parties have ""lost faith"" in the National Conference government.

The demand came following a high-powered Congress delegation led by state senior party leader and state PCC President Ghulam Nabi Azad meeting Election Commission here to apprise the EC about the prevailing situation in the state as well as in Gujarat, Azad told reporters.

""Election is the root cause of all problems in Jammu and Kashmir. In the last Parliamentary elections 90 per cent votes were rigged due to voters list... To have free and fair polls it is a must that governor rule is imposed in the state"", he said after meeting the EC.

The delegation included senior party leaders Manmohan Singh, Ambika Soni, Oscar Fernandes, Kapil Sibal and H R Bhardwaj, who impressed upon the commission that Kashmir problem would further deteriorate if there were no free and fair elections.

Azad, who was in June shifted to the state as PCC president, demanded that adequate security should be provided to leaders of other political parties at par with National Conference.

19,Early Gujarat polls will benefit people: Gill,"NEW DELHI: Strongly advocating early Assembly poll in Gujarat, former security advisor to Gujarat chief minister K P S Gill on Monday said the ""people"" opposing it would realise its benefit after some time even as he charged politicians with indulging in ""divisise politics"" for the sake of votes.

""Many people do not understand why I recommend early poll in Gujarat. But they will understand once time passes,"" said Gill, who wrapped up his task as security adviser last week saying his job was over as peace had returned to the state.

Confirming that the commission has received the official communication from the state government, EC sources said that it was not in a hurry and it would take some more time to crystallise its views on the poll in the state.

22,Centre to amend divorce law,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has decided to render a helping hand to women, who are either divorced or seeking maintenance from their estranged husbands.

It has worked out an amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 to enable women in distress resort to the courts at their own place of residence instead of where they had last lived with the spouse.

The law ministry said on Friday that section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act would be brought in conformity with section 126 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which prescribes the procedure for seeking maintenance and filing a divorce suit.

â€˜â€˜The amendment will enhance the human rights of women in distress besides making it more convenient for them to file suits for maintenance in the courts of the districts they reside,â€™â€™ sources said.

The government has circulated the proposal for amending the Act to all the state governments. The issue relates to the concurrent list and both the Centre and the state government can exercise the jurisdiction to amend the statute.

The Law Commission and the National Commissions for Women have strongly recommended the amendment in the larger interests of harassed women.

By amending the Hindu Marriage Act, the Special Marriage Act, 1954, the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936 and the CrPC, it has become obligatory on the part of the courts to grant interim relief within 60 days to a distressed woman or children from the wedlock, or aged parents.

Senior lawyer Vishwa Nath Saraf has lauded the amendment and said that the government should also try to infuse humane spirit among the courts and law-enforcing agencies dealing with cases of harassed and distressed women across the country.

23,Hero Hondo to hike FII's investment limit to 40%,"KOLKATA: Hero Honda Motors plans to increase investment limit of foreign institutional investors in the company to 40 per cent.

""At present, the foreign investors hold around 22 per cent in equity share capital of the company,"" the company sources said.

A special resolution seeking permission of the shareholders to increase investment limit of FIIs will be moved in during the annual general meeting on August 12, they said.

Since the increased investment by the foreign investors is considered to be in the interest of the company, the Board of Directors have already approved a proposal to this effect.

Meanwhile, Hero Honda has also decided to increase the number of directors of the company to 16, excluding FII nominees, which may be required in view of the expansion plans that it had envisaged for the future, including setting up of a new plant.

""The decision was taken as the company may need to appoint more directors/managing directors who may be nominated and designated by the promoter group and the collaborator in future,"" they said.

To give effect to this decision, the company will move another resolution seeking permission of the shareholders at the AGM to ammend its present Articles of Association which restrict appointment of so many directors.

26,Ex-minister Langah may surrender,"PATHANKOT: Has former PWD minister Sucha Singh Langah, who has been evading arrest for the last about three months, decided to surrender?

If his supporters in Dhariwal are to be believed, Langah is understood to be in a mood to give up and appear before the court shortly.

According to them, Langah is likely to appear before the court on or before July 30. Langah was booked by the vigilance bureau (VB) for amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income.

While the VB sleuths have been searching for him since then, PWD minister Partap Singh Bajwa, in a recent statement in Kahnuwan, had said that Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala had given him refuge in the neighbouring state. While others believe that Langah is hiding in Sri Ganganagar area in Rajasthan.

During the last three months, the VB officials have raided several suspected hideouts of Langah in Gurdaspur, including his residence in Dhariwal. He is estimated to have amassed wealth to the tune of Rs 12 crore including benami properties.

The Langah aides who have been released on bail by the court are saying that they had made statements regarding Langah purchasing property in their names, under pressure from the enforcement agencies. On the contrary, now they say that they themselves paid the money for the properties.

They have also deposed before the court that the tippers owned by Langah, in fact, belonged to them and reportedly produced the papers regarding the ownership in the court.

Not only the supporters of Langah had been advising him to surrender before the court, SAD chief Parkash Singh Badal is also understood to have asked him to do so without any further delay, it is learnt.

Dharna by BJP A Gurdaspur BJP delegation on Monday sat on a dharna in front of the DCâ€™s office in Gurdaspur and submitted a memorandum for the governor, alleging witch-hunting against the party members by the state government.

28,EC yet to decide on Gujarat elections,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has not yet decided on the date for a full meeting to take up the Gujarat government''s request for early elections in the state.

However, the EC confirmed on Monday having received an official communication from the state government in this connection.

According to EC officials, the commission was in no hurry and would take some more time to crystallise its views on polls in the state. ""The commission feels it should form an opinion before holding a meeting. Right now, all we can say is that the situation is tricky. We are evaluating the views of both sides.""

After Friday''s representation by former prime minister IK Gujral, a Congress delegation on Monday met Chief Election Commissioner JM Lyngdoh and the two election commissioners, TS Krishnamurthy and BB Tandon, and told them that early polls should not be held because of the communally surchared atmosphere in the state.

""The situation is far from normal in Gujarat. Thousands of people are still living in refugee camps. Thousands of people are homeless and have left the state. In this atmosphere, it is not just to hold elections in the state,"" Congress leader Manmohan Singh said after the meeting.

Congress MP Kapil Sibal said it was the obligation of the commission to see that the poll dates were announced only when they realised that the situation was ripe to hold a free and fair poll.

Besides Singh, the delegation included senior party leaders Ambika Soni, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Oscar Fernandes, and HR Bhardwaj.

29,BJP fear holding civic body polls,"RAJKOT: The ruling BJP was having double standards so far as holding elections to the state Assembly and the nagarpalika and panchayat elections were concerned.

While it was keen to hold early elections, it had time and again deferred elections to the local bodies.

According to information available, as many as 88 nagarpalikas, two district panchayats and 15 taluka panchayats were still awaiting elections even though their term had ended and were now ruled by administrators. These included nagarpalikas of Jasdan, Jetpur, Dhoraji, Upleta and Bhayavadar in Rajkot district.

The terms of these nagarpalikas had ended on February 24 last year and elections were deferred thrice by the state government.

The ruling BJP had faced poll reversals so far as the elections to the local bodies were concerned. The ruling party had not won a single election during the chief ministership of Keshubhai Patel and hence the government was delaying elections to the local bodies in these nagarpalikas on one pretext or the other.

The BJP was scared that any reversal in the nagarpalika elections would have an adverse impact in the Assembly elections.

Every time when the state election commission had decided to hold the elections, the ruling BJP - first under the chief ministership of Keshubhai and now under Narendra Modi - had decided to move against the decision of the election commission citing various reasons like drought, the Godhra carnage and other petty issues.

In January this year, the election notification for polls in the civic bodies was issued, but then came the Godhra incident and subsequent communal violence. This gave the Modi government another chance to postpone elections to the nagarpalikas. The term of these civic bodies was extended up to October 11 this year and now with the uncertainty over the state Assembly elections, it was doubtful when the elections for these nagarpalikas and taluka panchayat would be held.

As there were no elected representatives in the local bodies, it was left to the administrator to govern the local bodies. The civic functioning had come to a virtual standstill in most of these nagarpalikas, as there was no one to hear and reply the queries posed by the people.

30,Idea cellular makes incoming calls free,"AHMEDABAD: In anticipation of the price war that is likely to follow in the next few weeks after the arrival of new entrants in the cellular service market, Idea has taken the lead making all incoming calls free.

Idea chief operating officer, Gujarat, Sukanto Dey told TNN, ""We are trying to change the rules of the game to enhance growth and ensure an expanded platform for competition."" For the first time a mobile to mobile incoming call on Idea would actually be free. ""We are moving towards the CCP (calling party pays) regime,"" he said.

Gujarat is the first circle in the country of Idea cellular where this kind of a scheme has been launched.

Also, this is the first time when mobile to mobile goes free. Earlier, both Idea and Fascel had free incoming calls within their services. Fascel, however, was the first to do away with it last year-end and Idea followed suit.

Fascel''s Celforce was taken aback. Though company chief Sanjoy Mukherjee appreciated the package terming it ""an attractive basket"", he said ""We would evaluate the schemes and take feedback before affecting change in our tariff.""

Bharti, which is almost ready for launch in about 25 towns in the first phase, is still negotiating with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation for certain clearances. In the absence of certain AMC clearances, the company has been denied power supply for its Ahmedabad sites. The launch has once again missed its deadline of July 15.

Even the BSNL''s cellular launch is getting delayed due to bureaucratic hurdles and technical clearances. According to sources, the project, that was to be launched by June 30, is still waiting for a go-ahead from the corporate office in Delhi.

BSNL Gujarat chief Pradeep Kumar, however, said the process of setting up the network is still on. ""When others are slashing rates, one can imagine that we are not far away,"" quipped Kumar.
