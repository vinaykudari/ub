1,Israeli govt buys prime property on Aurangzeb Rd,"NEW DELHI: The Israeli government on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that it had deposited the full amount of Rs 25 crore as consideration for buying the Skipper Builderâ€™s property on Aurangzeb Road in Delhi.

The Israel government, through its embassy in India, said the balance amount of Rs 18.50 crore had been deposited with the Supreme Court registry.

It had earlier deposited Rs 6.51 crore.

A vacation Bench of Justices N Santosh Hegde and Shivaraj V Patil asked its registry to put the money received from the state of Israel in a fixed deposit with a nationalised bank. It will hear the matter relating to defrauding the allottees by the builder when the court re-opens in July after the vacation.

The apex court had directed the sale of 3, Aurangzeb Road, belonging to the Skipper Construction Company to recover the money due to the allottees of the companyâ€™s other projects. The money had been defrauded by the company owned by Tejwant Singh. The lone bid for the house, amounting to Rs 25.01 crore, was made by the Israel government.

It was allowed to buy the property for this amount as no other bids were received even after the lapse of sufficient time.

2,Mafia legislators planning to switch political loyalties?,"LUCKNOW: As the major players on the opposition benches join hands to topple the Mayawati Government, the upheaval thus generated has led to some drastic re-alignments of loyalties among the political musclemen.

Last week at least three secret meetings were held where these politicians got together to discuss their stance in case of trial of strength on the floor of the house. And if sources are to be believed, there are quite a few shocks in store for chief minister Mayawati. What had brought these dons together against the ruling coalition is the deep rooted feeling of being â€œleft outâ€� by the present regime once their utility in Vidhan Sabha was over.

And to add to it is a general feeling that all of them were â€œused and thrownâ€� at the behest of none other than the don turned MLA Amarmani Tripathi, who has been the closest to the CM. Be it Akhilesh Singh of Rae Bareli, Mukhtar Ansari of Mau, Madan Bhaiyya from western UP, not one of them appears inclined to to help bail out Mayawati from the crisis.

More so, Akhilesh Singh, believed to be underground since being named as accused in a kidnapping case recently, is even making all-out efforts to rope in four more MLAs who had earlier been his close aides but were lured away with ministerial berths by the ruling coalition in the recent past. On the run from the police, Akhilesh surfaced in Noida four days ago and got in touch with these four MLAs who reaffirmed their support to him.

Another nucleus of hectic activity among mafia-turned-politicians has been the industrial hub of Kanpur where Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya is lodged in prison under Pota. This independent MLA from Kunda has been in touch with at least three others of his pedigree.

A recent meeting held at a posh hotel in Kanpur saw the threesome assuring their help in case of change in government. Next, it is Mukhtar Ansari from Mau who has been, till recently, a blue-eyed MLA of chief minister Mayawati and vouched his support to her in the assembly on at least three occasions. Hospitalised at Lari Cardiology Centre on Tuesday after his appearance before a court here, Mukhtar has been unhappy over the state governmentâ€™s decision to shunt him back to Tihar as a punishment for visiting the DGP headquarters despite supposedly being in jail while in Lucknow.

Though he is tight-lipped over his stance on support to political players, the tight security at the hospital is a clear pointer to his relations with the government. What further establishes his alienation from the ruling coalition is that this time he has been virtually quarantined. Security guards at his bedside are not allowing any visitors. And a senior police officer made a surprise inspection of the ward where he is admitted to counter-check if Ansari was being allowed any relief. For independent MLA Madan Bhaiyya from Western UP, there seems hardly any option but to support the party in power.

Or else, a proclaimed absconder from Delhi High Court, Madan Bhaiyya knows where he will land if he dares to irk the party in power. For jailed MLA Atiq Ahmad, the scene in no way is different. But nursing a grudge against Mayawati for having him shoved behind bars, he is also learnt to have sent feelers about his joining hands to pull the carpet from under the ruling coalitionâ€™s feet.

4,EC punishes Nadia DM for violating election code,"KOLKATA: In a major embarrassment for the state government, the Election Commission on Friday replaced Nadia district magistrate Krishna Gupta as returning officer for Sundayâ€™s Lok Sabha by-election in Nabadwip on charges of violation of the model code of conduct.

The action was taken after Gupta visited chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the circuit house on June 4, during the CMâ€™s visit to Krishnagar to campaign. Gupta has been transferred to Delhi as the resident commissioner.

Though Gupta said his visit to the CM was a courtesy call, state chief electoral officer Nurul Haque said the EC had taken exception to the visit after a complaint by Opposition parties. It was the first action of its kind against a district magistrate in the state by the EC, Haque said. Divisional commissioner (presidency range) S.K. Magon was appointed the new returning officer.

â€œUnder normal circumstances, the returning officer cannot meet the leader of any political party on a campaign trip. In his capacity as the DM, he could have met the chief minister only if some natural calamity or some breakdown of law and order had taken place,â€� Haque said.

5,MIM leader's death sparks riot,"HYDERABAD: Violence erupted in several areas in the city on Friday, a day after a local leader of the Majlise-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (MIM) died in a clash between people belonging to different communities on Thursday.

With rumours doing the rounds that the inspector of the Habeebnagar police station was involved in the MIM leader Mohammed Ghouseâ€™s death, the situation turned volatile on Friday. Shortly after the last rites of Ghouse were performed at a cemetery near the Bhoiguda Kaman, groups of young men began pelting stones in several surrounding areas including Seetharambagh, Asifnagar, Charminar and Moghalpura. Two two-wheelers were set on fire, a car damaged and petrol poured into a wine shop near Charminar by the violent mob.

The wine shop owner, however, put out the fire with the help of local Maithri committee members. At Mallepally, where the trouble began on Thursday, a mob set ablaze vehicles parked outside the local branch of the State Bank of India. Timely intervention by police stopped the mob from entering the bank. Police fired 20 rounds, many of them in the air at Mallepally and Agapura while near Habeebnagar playground they had to fire over the heads of the rioters to disperse them. No one was injured in the firing.

Police had to resort to caning rioters at some other places. Central zone DCP C V Anand was reportedly attacked with stones while he was touring the sensitive areas. The three attackers were chased into a place of worship. When the DCP demanded that they come out, the youth emerged and denied the charge that they had attacked him.

MIM MLAs Asaduddin Owaisi and Mumtaz Ahmed, who arrived at the spot, demanded that the youngsters be released. Even as the task force police bundled the three men into a jeep, a mob surrounded the vehicle and forced the police to free the arrested youngsters.

6,"TDP leaders cross border, court arrest","ANANTAPUR/BANGALORE: The Karnataka police on Friday arrested two Telugu Desam MPs and five MLAs, among others, when they tried to march to the Paragodu project after crossing the inter-state border.

With the TDP legislators and MPs insisting on going towards Paragodu, about 10 km from the

border, the Kolar district police took 23 leaders into custody and lodged them in the Bagepalli police station. The leaders were let off in the evening after they signed personal bonds.

The TDP has called for an Anantapur district bandh on Saturday to protest the arrests. High drama preceded the arrest of the leaders at the border checkpost in the morning when TDP workers, led by Penugonda MLA Paritala Ravi and Anantapur MP K Srinivasulu insisted that the Anantapur police permit them to cross the border. Ministers Nimmala Kistappa and S Chandramohan Reddy addressed a public meeting at Kodikonda border point inside AP, but did not cross the border.

Ravi and Srinivasulu urged the cadre to cross the border. Though Anantapur DIG A V Narayana and SP Anil Kumar initially refused to permit the TDP leaders to move further, they too later relented and allowed a small contingent to go ahead. However, before the TDP workers â€” about 500 of them â€” stepped into the Karnataka territory, they were stopped by the Kolar district police and asked to go back.

When the TDP leaders refused to budge, they were huddled into waiting police vehicles and taken to Bagepalli town. The arrested include MP B K Parthasarathy, Srinivasulu, MLAs Ravi, K Jayaram, P Raghunath Reddy, Sainath Goud and C C Venkataramudu. Mild tension prevailed for a while, when Karnataka police bashed up a security guard to Ravi, who tried to get into the vehicle along with his boss.

In Bangalore, two Karnataka ministers took a dig at the Centre for remaining silent over the â€œunnecessary ruckusâ€™â€™ by AP on the Chitravati barrage. Water resources minister H K Patil and Kolar district in-charge minister V Muniyappa asserted that Karnataka will complete the project as scheduled. â€œIt is our duty to provide drinking water to people. The Centre should take an interest in this and not keep quiet,â€™â€™ Patil told reporters here.

Muniyappa said: â€œThe dharna by AP will not change our minds. We will convince the Centre to support us on humanitarian grounds as most people in this area suffer from fluorosis.â€™â€™ Patil said â€œWe are well within legal limits. Chitravati barrage proposal was laid before the Central Water Commission meeting at Hyderabad in December 2001. AP did not make any dissent note then,â€™â€™ he pointed out, adding it was time AP leaders stopped making â€œirresponsible statementsâ€™â€™.

7,"Ajit urges farmers to defeat BJP, allies","MEERUT: Former Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh expressed his annoyance over his ouster from the Central cabinet and exhorted farmers of western UP to frustate all attempts by the BJP and its allies to return to power in the Centre after next yearâ€™s Lok Sabha polls.

Addressing his first farmersâ€™ rally on Friday in his Parliamentary constituency after his dismissal from the Cabinet, Singh said the BJPâ€™s days in most big states were numbered.

He clarified that factionalism within the central unit of the party on the leadership issue, attempt to revive the Ayodhya to derive mileage and fear of trying to repeat Modiâ€™s experiment in states like UP may contribute to the partyâ€™s setback in the polls.

â€˜â€˜Voters are aware of their tricks to garner support and they are no longer going to be befooled,â€™â€™ he said.

The RLD chief made it clear that the senior party leaders in the state, with the help of the Samajwad Party, Congress and RKP were trying to oust the government.

8,Princely school breaks gender wall,"RAJKOT: It has always been a princely affair at the Rajkumar College here â€” both in style and gender.

But, 135 years after the establishment of Indiaâ€™s first public school, the classrooms that groomed maharajas and the likes of Mahatma Gandhi, Ranjitsinhji and Duleepsinhji in its strict boysâ€™ school ambience, will now open its doors for the eves too.

Year after year, one motion has remained the hot favourite during debating sessions here â€” â€˜Should Rajkumar College be made a co-education institution?â€™ Now, as 30 girls walk its corridors when the school begins its new session on June 18, the debate will be finally put to rest.

And, from old students of this school established in 1868 for the princes to parents queuing up to admit their children, girls on the campus are a sign of the times, a welcome move.

Perhaps, cricketer Ajay Jadeja, an illustrious alumni, wouldnâ€™t mind padding up for another innings at school as it goes co-educational. For many, going back to school isnâ€™t a bad idea. â€œIt certainly would be exciting to be studying in this era,â€� says Satyajit Khachar, scion of the Jasdan royal family,who is a council member and has two of his sons, studying at Rajkumar College.

But,what made Rajkumar College, popularly known as RKC, break the more-than-a-century old â€œgender wallâ€�? â€œSegregation based on gender in schools in not healthy. But, it is not the first time that we have admitted girls. In the early 50s, we took in daughters of senior officers and the elite as day scholars for a brief period since there were no English medium schools in Rajkot. But, the practice was stopped once the Nirmala Convent School for girls came up in the mid-50s,â€� says principal Ayaz Khan Babi, himself an old student.

The idea struck Babi,when, during an alumni meet, a former student told the gathering that he did not put his son into RKC because it was purely boysâ€™ school. â€œThis set us thinking as turning the school co-educational has been a hotly debated topic.We have often been asked why we didnâ€™t start a rajkumari college,â€� said Babi.

What began as an experiment last year, allowing girls between standards one and five, is now the rule. If 13 girls walked in last year, the figure has touched 30 this year. The school has also announced that it would soon start its first boarding facility for girls.

â€œThe experience will be enriching for both the boys and girls. The boys have accepted the presence of girls in the classroom, on the campus. Itâ€™s been beautiful,â€� gushes Babi.

â€œThese kids now will grow up in different atmosphere. Moreover, girls are more studious and it will give rise to a healthy competition,â€� says an old student Ashit Chhaniara, who has admitted his son to the â€œplayhouseâ€� section of RKC.

Another old student, Rahul Mehta, is happy now that his daughter is in RKC. â€œIt is a good school and when they opened up to girls, I put my daughter in. I welcome the move to bring in girls as an institution should change with the times,â€� says Mehta.

9,Politburo yet to decide on election pact with Congress,"KOLKATA: The Congress should first spell out its strategy on electoral alliances, said the CPM. The latter though refused to rule out the possibility of such a tieup for the next Lok Sabha election.

The CPM was in the process of identifying its electoral allies, said CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury before attending the four-day central committee and politburo meetings that began here on Friday.

â€œThe Congress will have to spell out its strategy. On our part, we, too, will decide our strategy on alliance,â€� stated Yechury.

He further said that the party politburo and the central committee would decide the gameplan to be followed during the forthcoming Assembly elections in four states.

Senior CPM leaders claimed that the party would be able to overcome differences within it on the issue of joining hands with the Congress to combat the BJP in next yearâ€™s Lok Sabha elections.

The likely stand of the party would be to rely on floor coordination with the Congress, instead of supporting the Congress openly, in its fight against the BJP.

The future understanding between the Congress and other secular parties, especially with Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, would be closely observed, they claimed.

10,Punjab govt to crack down on fake drugs,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab government has launched a state wide crackdown on the sale and supply of spurious drugs in Punjab. In a statement issued here on Friday, Punjab health minister RC Dogra said the campaign would be intensified as Punjab is considered to be the main hub of substandard drugs.

Dogra said the World Health Organisation studies point out that 34 per cent of the worldâ€™s fake drug supply comes from India and Indian Drug Manufactures Association (IDMA) estimates that 25 per cent of the 20,000 crore drugs manufactured in India are spurious and sub-standard.

North India, Punjab in particular, is the centre of this activity. During the raids conducted in the last fortnight by the state drug controller, serious breaches of Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and allied laws came to the fore. Of the 24 chemists raided, licences of seven were cancelled while of 12 others were placed under suspension. Drugs suspected to be substandard or spurious were also drawn for test and action would be taken after reports are received. The drug controller has also been directed to ensure that every retail outlet should have a qualified pharmacist on the premises, who would wear a white apron with his or her name displayed on it.

11,SSF to fight for voting rights in SGPC polls,"CHANDIGARH: The Sehajdhari Sikh Federation (SSF) will challenge the Union home ministryâ€™s decision to disenfranchise the Sehajdhari Sikhs from the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) elections.

In a statement issued here on Friday, SSF president PS Ranu accused the RSS of playing its cards through the SGPC and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to create a â€˜minority within the minorityâ€™. He said 80 percent of the Sikhs were â€˜non-amritdhariâ€™ and not granting them their fundamental voting rights, which had already stood the test of times, was unjustified.

He said the SGPC general house had passed a resolution to debar the Sehajdharis from voting in the SGPC elections and repeatedly the Union government had been pressurised by the Akali Dals and the SGPC to pass an ordinance to this effect. He said his party was registered with the Election Commission of India and would challenge the notification or ordinance, whenever issued by the Union government.

14,US claims on Iraqi germ weapons political: Analysts,"NEW YORK: Disputing US administration''s claims that the ""mysterious"" trailers found in Iraq were for making biological weapons, analysts have said the government''s announcement was ""political"" and lacked proof.

They said that the mobile units were more likely intended for other purposes and charged that the evaluation process had been damaged by a rush to judgement.

""Everyone has wanted to find the ''smoking gun'' so much that they may have wanted to have reached this conclusion,"" an expert who had seen the trailers was quoted as saying by a US newspaper. ""I am very upset with the process.""

The Bush administration has said the two trailers, which allied forces found in Iraq in April and May, are evidence that Saddam Hussein was hiding a biological warfare programme.

In a white paper last week, it publicly detailed its case, even while conceding discrepancies in the evidence and a lack of hard proof.

According to the newspaper report, at least three teams of Western experts examined the trailers. While the first two groups were largely convinced that the vehicles were intended for making germ agents, the third group of more senior analysts divided sharply over the function of the trailers, with several members expressing strong scepticism.

""I have no great confidence that it''s a fermenter,"" a senior analyst with long experience in unconventional arms said of a tank for multiplying seed germs into lethal swarms.

The government''s public report, he added, ""was a rushed job and looks political.""

The mobile plants lacked gear for steam sterilisation, normally a pre-requisite for any kind of biological production, peaceful or otherwise, experts said.

15,"BJP, BSP leaders booked for violence","JALANDHAR: Curfew was clamped in more areas here on Saturday as caste violence continued for the third day even as police registered FIRs against Punjab BJP vice-president Vijaya Sampla, district BSP chief Pawan Tinu and 12 others for allegedly instigating riots.

A minor clash broke out on Saturday morning in Talhan village, where an indefinite curfew has been in force since Thursday night following clashes between Jat Sikhs and Dalits, official sources said.

Overnight violence was reported from a number of areas in the disrict prompting authorities to clamp curfew in Buta Mandi, Bhargo camp, Abadpura, Siddharth Nagar, Ravi Dass Nagar, Jyoti Chowk and Nakodar Chowk.

Besides Sampla and Tinu, police have also booked Dalit Action Committee president Channu Ram and committee member Lahori Ram among others in connection with the violence.

Shops remained closed here in response to the Jalandhar bandh call given by the Dalit Action Committee and policemen were deployed in strength in view of cremation of a Dalit youth killed in police firing following clashes on Thursday night.

While the Janata Dal (Secular) accused Opposition SAD-BJP of vitiating the atmosphere, Shiromani Akali Dal Chief Parkash Singh Badal sought immediate resignation of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.

""The chief minister should own responsibility for his utter failure to give good and effective governance to the state and step down without any further delay,"" he told reporters here.

Alleging there was no law and order in the state, Badal said he would bring the growing lawlessness to the notice of the governor and the Union home ministry.

""The explosive situation in the state following incidents at Talhan village is the direct consequence of the policy of drift and utter negligence on the part of the chief minister,"" he alleged.

Badal said the issue had been brewing for sometime and even the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes had asked the state to take timely steps to difuse the situation.

""But the government sat tight over its constitutional responsibility and allowed things to drift in a dangerous direction"", he said.

The Akali leader said casteist violence had never taken place in Punjab. ""Even during the days of militancy, the state remained free from communal, casteist or any other form of mob violence,"" he said.

Badal appealed to the people to maintain peace and communal harmony.

By refusing to order a CBI probe into the incident, the UDF Government was only trying to shield one of its alliance partners, he charged, adding BJP was keen to cooperate in restoring peace in Marad if Government agreed to its demands.

Meanwhile, office-bearers of the Women''s wing of the Araya Samajam, demanded that the arrested members of the Samajam be released immediately.
