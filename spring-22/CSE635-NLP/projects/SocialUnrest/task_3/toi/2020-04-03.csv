0,DDA violates monument rules,"NEW DELHI: Cocking a snook at the rule book, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is running its officersâ€™ club close to the historic Siri Fort wall, which has been declared as a protected monument by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI).

According to the Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, no digging or building activity is allowed within 200 metres of a protected monument. During a survey of the area in November last year, an ASI inspection team found the club had been constructed 49.75 metres from the exposed remains of the Siri Fort wall and 42 metres from the mound aligned with the fort.

Not just the club, a banquet hall and a tank-top restaurant called Asiad Towers are in tact despite being served demolition notices by the ASI. â€˜â€˜Since the DDA has constructed the officersâ€™ club in the prohibited area... without obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the ASI, the structure so raised is unauthorised and liable to be removed,â€™â€™ the ASI inspection team says in its report.

Following the inspection teamâ€™s report, ASI director (monuments) K P Poonacha issued a notice to the DDA and the hallâ€™s owners. The DDA was given 15 days time to remove the â€˜â€˜unauthorised constructionâ€™â€™. â€˜â€˜Failure to comply within the specified period, action shall be taken for the removal of the same and you shall be liable to pay the cost of removal...As you have unlawfully constructed the building in the protected area of monument, you are also liable to be punished under the rules,â€™â€™ the notice says. DDA commissioner-cum-secretary V M Bansal argued that the club and hall were no longer being used for marriages and were only being used for training new DDA officers.

â€˜â€˜We have replied to the ASIâ€™s notice but have not heard from them yet. The ball is now in their court,â€™â€™ Bansal said. This dispute had reached the high court last year. But following the competing contentions on the existence of the Siri Fort wall, the court had disposed of the matter, leaving the ASI to inspect the site and take action.

1,These snakes byte Pak govt sites,"BANGALORE: Cobra, Snake Eyes, Beelzebuth, Roxx, King Cobra, Devil Incarnate. These ideologically charged twenty-somethings constitute the Yaha, a band of vengeful Indian hackers who take pride in destroying Pakistani government websites.

The members of the Yaha group, whose identity is concealed, work with reputable IT security companies as hackers. Hailing from Bangalore, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, New Delhi and Kochi, these â€˜cyber-nationalistsâ€™ interact online by using their code names.

Their only communication channel is their website, http://indiansnakes. cjb.net. Yaha is strict about inducting new people. â€œThough thousands of experts want to join us, we are careful about taking new members. Today, there are only six core members and 20 associate members in our group,â€™â€™ Beelzebuth, a core member who is a security expert with an MNC in Bangalore, told The Times of India.

The Yaha group sprang up in retaliation to the attack on the Indian defence ministry site by Pakistani hackers in June 2002. â€œAfter the Indian sites were defaced, we felt the need to avenge this insult and show Pak we are technologically superior.â€™â€™

Beelzebuth claims Pakistani hackers destroyed over 1,000 Indian government sites between 1998 and 2000. Cobra, from Thiruvananthapuram, wrote the first worm, Yaha-e. He and Snake Eyes unleashed it on pak.gov.pk, which went bust from June 15 to July 1.

Soon after, the hackers took control of one of the servers of comsat.net (nodal agency of the IT infrastructure of the Pakistani agencies) and launched the worm from there. The virus attack came with a warning to Pakistani hackers: â€œYour days are over; now itâ€™s our turn to show India is great.â€™â€™

Yaha worms disable antivirus software and command the computer to launch a denial-of-service attack of Pakistani websites. â€œFollowing the attack, the Pakistani government changed the name of the website to infopak.gov.pk without rectifying the security holes,â€™â€™ Beelzebuth says.

On New Yearâ€™s eve, Yaha wanted to wish Pakistani hackers a â€˜very good new yearâ€™. New worms Yaha-i, Yaha-k and Yaha-j, created by Roxx, a standard 12 student from Bangalore, were released on December 31. These crippled infopak.gov.pk from January 1 to January 15.

These worms have caused 25,000 infections around the world. The Yaha worms have been leaving anti-Pakistani messages on hard drives, though one such message suggests that the hack in not politically motivated.

2,State govt to ban ‘khesari dal’,"PATNA: The state government has decided to ban the sale of â€œkhesari dalâ€� and its products and â€œkhesariâ€� flour and its products in the state with effect from January 1, 2004.

The government has also decided to ban the sale of mixture of â€œkhesari dalâ€� and Bengal chana (gram) or â€œkhesari dalâ€� and some other pulse from the same date.

The decision has been taken in exercise of the powers conferred on the government under Rule 44-A of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1955.

The health department issued a notification about the ban on April 1, 2003 amending partially its earlier notification issued on September 9, 2002 banning the sale of â€œkhesari dalâ€� and its products in the state three months from the date of issuing of the notification. The notification said that no person shall sell, or offer for sale or be in the possession of the same for the purpose of sale of â€œkhesari dalâ€� and its products.

Several other states have already banned the sale of â€œkhesari dalâ€� and its products.

The copies of the amended notification has already been sent to all the government departments, divisional commissioners and district magistrates.

The ban on â€œkhesari dalâ€� follows the view expressed by the Mumbai High Court on the matter about two years back. The Union health ministry had, in a communication to the Bihar health commissioner, Ashok Kumar Chaudhary, in December 2001, apprised him of the views of the Mumbai High Court on the matter.

Mumbai High Court was of the view that Bihar and UP should also impose ban on the sale of â€œkhesari dalâ€� and its products.

A health department official said that a petition had been filed in the HC demanding ban on the use of â€œkhesariâ€� in the country. The petitioner had claimed that the consumption of â€œkhesariâ€� had a crippling effect, the official said.

The Union health ministry had, however, also informed Chaudhary that agriculture experts were of the view of that with less toxic variety of â€œkhesariâ€� seed now being available to farmers, the states concerned could even avoid imposing ban on its consumption.

The health department official said that a few years back when the issue had cropped up, the then agriculture production commissioner had opposed the idea of imposing ban, describing it as the poor manâ€™s food.

The chief engineer informed the court that by June end all the 44 tubewells would be energised. At this, counsel for the petitioner M P Gupta said that the summer has already set in and the residents of the city are not getting pure drinking water in adequate quantity, although a sum of Rs 12.50 crore of the 11th Finance Commission for this purpose is already with the state government.

The chief engineer further stated that due to the objections raised by the principal of the A N College and some MLAs, borings at three places could not be completed.

7,NDA govt raking up non-issues: Sonia,"SUMERPUR, Rajasthan: Stepping up attack on the Vajpayee dispensation ahead of electoral battles in four states, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday said the government was pursuing anti-people and anti-farmer policies and was deviating from real issues by raking up non-issues.

Accusing the NDA government of failing to mitigate people''s problems, Gandhi at a public meeting here projected her party as the only saviour of the masses.

""Programmes and policies pursued by BJP are harming interests of the people who need employment and commodities of daily use at reasonable prices,"" she said.

Terming the NDA government as anti-people, Gandhi charged it with raking up non-issues to sidetrack real issues.

Referring to drought, Gandhi said large parts of the country were reeling under it and charged the Centre with not extending help to states to provide relief to affected people.

The Congress president was speaking after launching reconstruction work of a canal at Jawai dam.

9,US wants to quickly install new govt in Baghdad,"WASHINGTON: The United States plans to install an interim government in Baghdad, if possible as soon as within a week to a fortnight, even while it tries to squeeze Saddam Hussain and his party apparatus out into the open to finish them off.

US officials say they have taken almost total control of the Saddam Hussain International Airport and have reached the outskirts of Baghdad without much of a fight from the regime that still controls the city itself. American forces are now planning to go into the city at a time of their choosing, take over key facilities, and begin running the show even if Saddam is still holed up in the city and there fighting in parts of the city.

The idea is to begin exercising administrative control over the city and restore basic civic amenities so that it can win the local population over to their side. This they say is the surest way to make the Saddam regime irrelevant and to demoralise it.

Washington hopes that Baghdad''s five million residents, including two million Shias who it believes have been oppressed by the Saddam regime and have no loyalty to him, will largely welcome the coalition effort to put an end to their day-to-day difficulties.

Baghdad went without lights on Thursday night and the telephone system has collapsed almost totally. The water and sanitation system is still holding up.

Claiming to have taken over the Saddam Hussain International Airport almost completely, US officials express no great concern over the possibility of urban combat in Baghdad while acknowledging the going could still be tough.

Military experts also suggested U.S forces would not fall into the trap of engaging in classic urban warfare or lay siege to Baghdad and put the citizens to greater difficulty. Instead, the coalition would attempt to induct an administrative apparatus into the areas it controlled.

""You''re going to have Baghdad isolated, you''re going to have half the population that probably wants nothing to do with the folks, the oppressive regime,"" Joint chiefs of Staff Gen. Richard B. Myers, said at a Pentagon briefing on Thursday. ""And then you''ll start working at it as you can.""

While declaring that ""whatever remnants are left would not be in charge of anything except their own defence,"" Myers however counselled patience and indicated that it would take some time for the coalition to establish complete control.

The only danger to U.S forces now comes in the form of asymmetric warfare, according to military analysts here. The formal Iraqi Army has just melted away and the Saddam regime might now use guerrilla tactics and suicide bombers to harass coalition forces as they move into Baghdad.

But US officials indicated that they are in no great hurry to go into the city, and when it happened it would be a piecemeal approach with the primary aim of restoring normal life. There is also talk here of the coalition forces quickly handing over administrative duties to Iraqi exiles and citizens who come forward.

10,BJP eyes Parivar strength for polls,"

NEW DELHI: The BJP has decided to employ the energies of the entire Sangh Parivar, as it had successfully done in Gujarat, in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chhatisgarh later this year. These polls will set the stage for the general elections in 2004.

To this end, the party will henceforth formalise and regularise interactions among various RSS frontal organisations.

Party general secretary Mukthar Abbas Naqvi said on Friday that representatives of the Sangh outfits would meet once a week in every town, once a month in every district, every two months in every state and once every three months nationally for better ``coordination''''.

The BJP will also call upon its reserve force ^ workers who are no longer active ^ to ``dedicate themselves'''' to the party till the next elections. Of the 10,000 former activists it hopes to draw upon, 5,000 will be deployed in the states set to go to the polls this year. This, along with a sharp crackdown on the growing indiscipline in its ranks, the party feels, should give it the edge in the four states currently ruled by the Congress.

The BJP''s twin goals of running a tight party machine and bringing the Hindutva agenda to the fore were evident on the opening day of the party''s two-day national executive here both in Venkaiah Naidu''s presidential speech as well as in the discussions on the coming assembly elections.

Taking a cue from the recent RSS pratinidhi sabha, where a resolution on Veer Savarkar was highlighted to provide a new entry point into the Hindutva agenda, Naidu, too, focussed on the subject. ``The freedom movement had thrown up several leaders and heroes... We should not allow our political differences to denigrate any of them.''''

He described the Congress boycott of the unveiling of Savarkar''s portrait in Parliament''s Central Hall as ``nothing but a manifestation of the political philosophy and approach of pseudo-secularist who were always guided by vote bank politics''''.

Naidu''s choice of issues which he wanted the party to project also fitted into the BJP''s new determination to return to its roots. He asked state governments to effectively act against terrorism and detect and delete from the rolls and deport infiltrators, and announce a special package for Kashmiri Pandits.

The party will also project the new NCERT curriculum as a ``corrective to past practice'''', demand an anti-conversion law in all states, call for a scrapping of the controversial IMDT Act, ask for a ban on cow slaughter and measures to effectively check population.

The Congress, understandably, came in for strong criticism not just in the four states going to the polls but also in Jammu and Kashmir, where it is in power with the PDP. ``It is time the Congress reviewed its Kashmir policy failing which it would be doing a great disservice to the people of the state,'''' Naidu said.

11,Cong asks PM to restore rule of law,"NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Friday sought the Prime Minister''s intervention to restore the rule of law and act against the Vishwa Hindu Parishad since it has ""admitted that it was responsible for the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the protracted communal violence of Gujarat last year"".

Congress spokesman Jaipal Reddy claimed: ``The operation of laws has been suspended for the benefit of the Sangh Parivar. No action has been taken against the VHP despite the admission that it was responsible for the demolition and last year''s riots. Even the self-proclaimed offenders have not been arrested.''''

Reddy also pointed out that while the leaders of the Parivar are able to go to scot free, Congress activists are being arrested under Pota in Andhra Pradesh. ``Konda Surekha, an MLA, has been arrested on the ground that she has spoken to some People''s War Group people. And this too is based on the submission made by a third person.''''

Reddy condemned the AP government''s action and claimed that it was one more example of the abuse of Pota.

12,"Another rally, this time it's BSP","NEW DELHI: After big players like the ruling NDA and the principal opposition, the Congress, have held their shows of strength, it is now the turn of the parvenu Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to impress everybody with a rally in the Capital.

The Kanshi Ram-Mayawati duo will address the party gathering this Sunday primarily to make a point about its aspiration to emerge as a major player in national politics.

After tasting power in Uttar Pradesh, the party is undoubtly ambitious now. It has made it clear that the coalition with the BJP in Uttar Pradesh will not be stretched beyond the borders of the state. ``Our leadership has already said that there will be no poll alliance outside UP,'''' BSP Delhi unit chief Dharamveer Singh Ashok said on Friday.

The party ruled out any possibility of a tie-up with the BJP for the coming Delhi Assembly elections. It has decided to field candidates for all the 70 assembly seats in the Capital.

The rally at Ramlila Maidan seems to be the party''s way of telling everyone about its viability as an important player in the months before the assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh and Delhi to be followed by the Lok Sabha polls.

The BSP, interestingly, is keen to keep the coalition going in UP while stoutly ruling out any such possibility elsewhere. It has always opposed anypre-poll alliance. Asked about the BSP reluctance for an electoral tie-up, Mayawati had remarked some time ago: ``Our votes are transferable, others'' not.''''
