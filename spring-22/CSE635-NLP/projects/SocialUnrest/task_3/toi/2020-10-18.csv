1,"At Panipat, disinvestment is left out of speeches...","PANIPAT: On Saturday, the day when a major expansion of Indian Oil Corporation''s (IOC) Panipat refinery was announced, disinvestment had a bad time and was crowded out completely.

Old Nehruvian themes of nation building, self reliance and giving command to strategic sectors of the economy were back. Disinvestment was carefully elided from all speeches delivered at the venue.

""Petroleum and development are synonymous,"" Union petroleum minister Ram Naik said in his speech and mentioned that the region requires 32 million tonnes of petroleum products at the present level of consumption.

He emphasised, more than once, in his speech the role of large infrastructure projects, like the refinery at Panipat, as being the cornerstone of nation building efforts and praised the efforts of officers and workers of IOC in making the Panipat project a success.

With the expansion of refining capacity from six million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) to a huge 12 MMTPA by 2005, a stand alone refining business divorced from retailing of products seemed as remote the venue from the ministry of disinvestment in Delhi.

If Naik was careful not to give any hint of controversy on the hiving of IOC''s refining and retail business, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was more forthright in spelling out the strategic and self-reliance objectives of the oil sector.

""Today we are here to open a project that will go a long way in making the country self-reliant in petroleum and it will have spin-off effects in employment generation and development of this region,"" he said.

In the same breath, Vajpayee mentioned how the country needs such projects to evade conditions tagged to oil imports from other countries.

""This is strategically a very important sector. In times of war, we cannot be seen as depending on foreign sources for our needs of this vital commodity. We are not the ones who can be threatened and projects like these will take us far on the road where such threats will cease to matter.""

Other speakers at the venue echoed similar sentiments in their speeches.

2,Two more students commit suicide,"HYDERABAD: Two more students committed suicide in separate incidents on Friday in the city and its suburbs.

In the first case, a 15-year-old student committed suicide by setting himself ablaze on Friday out of fear that his parents would reprimand him for failing in four subjects in the recently held quarterly examinations.

According to the Kandukur police, the class IX student has been identified as M Narasimha, son of Mallaiah, a resident of Mucherla village in Kandukur. He was studying in the Government High School in the same locality.

Police said the boy might have committed suicide due to fear that his parents would scold him as he had failed in four subjects.

Both Mallaiah and his wife Kistamma were not at home when the boy took the extreme step.

In yet another incident, a 20-yearold B.Com first year student allegedly committed suicide by consuming poison-laced cool drink on Friday evening.

According to the Kachiguda railway police, J Vamsi Krishna, son of Lakshmana Chari, a resident of Sriramnagar Colony, Gowlipura.

However, the reasons behind the extreme step were yet to be known.

On Friday, Vamsi had gone to the Malakpet railway station along with his two friends. The trio bought soft drinks there but Vamsi reportedly mixed some poison in his bottle and consumed the drink.

As soon as Vamsi fell unconscious, his two friends rushed him to a private hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead.

3,Leave benefits for govt staff still in limbo,"BANGALORE: With the festival season around, scores of Karnataka government employees who had planned to surrender their Earned Leave (EL) in lieu of cash are disappointed, as their applications have been rejected.

Besides, government employees on the verge of retirement and those drawing pension stand to lose a substantial amount in their benefits. Against the pension amount calculated on the last pay drawn, an average of 10 months'' basic salary will now be taken for computation.

Reason: chief minister S.M. Krishna''s assurance on October 1 that the government will withdraw its September 30 order, which put a freeze till February 2004 on employees encashing their EL, is yet to be implemented. Each employee is entitled to encash 30 days'' EL once in two years.

""Any decision on staying the already issued GO has to be taken in the cabinet. This, because suspending certain benefits enjoyed by government employees were part of the austerity measures decided in the cabinet meeting to mobilise resources for the Rs 880-crore farmers'' package. Hence the order has to go back to the cabinet,'''' sources told the Sunday Times of India.

Treasury department sources said they had returned all applications for leave encashment as they had no instructions from the finance department. ""As on today, the September 30 order is in force,'''' they added.

However, on September 27, addressing a convention of state government employees'' association in Mandya, Krishna announced that contribution by them towards drought relief should be voluntary.

When this was brought to Krishna''s notice, he assured to stay the GO. ""The government has no plans to cut the existing benefits enjoyed by employees,'''' he said and the GO''s issuance was attributed to a ""communication gap'''' with the finance department.

Even as the employees are sulking, the government quietly withdrew an order on Friday, in which it had announced a Rs 5-crore relief for crop loss to farmers in Mandya district. It was withdrawn after the Mandya Zilla Hitaraskhana Samiti, led by former MP G. Made Gowda and former MLA K.S. Puttannaiah, rejected the package as they have pegged the loss at Rs 141 crore.

Officials held discussions with the farmers representatives in Bangalore, which was a follow-up to their meeting with Krishna on October 1.

The Rs 5-crore package covered Srirangapatna, Mandya, Malavalli, Maddur and Pandavapura taluks in the district. ""We have rejected the offer and will hold another round of talks with the chief minister,'''' both said.

4,"ACP, 2 other cops arrested under MCOCA","MUMBAI: Three police officers, including an assistant commissioner and a senior inspector from the elite crime branch, were arrested on Saturday in connection with the multi-crore fake stamp paper racket.

All three were arrested by the Special Investigation Team looking into the scam and booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). They were taken to Pune, where they will be produced before a metropolitan court.

Those arrested were assistant commissioner of police Gokul Patil of the state intelligence department, senior inspector Vashist Andhale of the airport unit of the crime branch and sub-inspector Prabhaker Kakde of the Nallasopara police station.

Sources in the SIT, based in Pune, said they were likely to arrest an IPS officer posted at the state police headquarters in the next few days. â€œThis officer had demanded Rs 40 lakhs from scam kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi,â€™â€™ the sources said.

The SIT is also probing the role of a high-profile deputy police commissioner and an assistant commissioner in Mumbai.

Telgi had printed and sold fake stamp papers for the last decade with the connivance of officials at the state government printing press at Nashik. He had been arrested on several occasions but had managed to get off the hook by allegedly bribing policemen and politicians.

The first major case was registered against him by the Bund Garden police in Pune in November 2001.

Andhale is the third Mumbai police officer to be arrested in the case. The SIT team has already arrested assistant inspector Dilip Kamath and senior inspector D.Y. Dhal of the Mumbai crime branch. Inspector K.K. Parmar of the airport crime branch was suspended in connection with the case on August 30, 2003.

A city police officer said the arrests had â€œdemoralisedâ€™â€™ some officers in the crime branch. The SIT team has so far arrested about 33 persons, including Telgiâ€™s lawyer Rasheed Kulkarni, MLA Anil Gote from Dhule, and some officials of the state government press.

The Mumbai police has been accused of not taking action against Telgi in seven offences registered against him at various police stations since 1995.

6,Former engineer defends DC rule circulars,"PUNE: Former city engineer Madhav Harihar has strongly contested the view that the Pune Municipal Corporationâ€™s (PMC) city engineer is not empowered to issue circulars interpreting the development control (DC) rules.

A ruling to this effect was given by municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar at a civic general body meeting here on Friday.

Kumar assured the general body that he would forward to it for scrutiny, all the 124 circulars issued by city engineers over the last five decades.

In a statement issued to the press on Saturday, Harihar has warned that if the old circulars were cancelled, it would create a â€œconfusionâ€� among PMC engineers and the process of clearing building plans would come to a standstill.

Harihar has claimed that the circulars were issued to ensure that the engineers had a clear interpretation of DC rules and that consistency was maintained in building permissions. â€œOfficials from the city engineers office get transferred after some years and new appointments are made. If there are no guidelines spelling out the rules, new engineers may sanction plans according to their understanding of the rules,â€�

Harihar has stated. Asserting that there was no need to seek prior approval of the general body to issue such circulars, Harihar said a city engineer in his capacity as the head of his department, can issue a circular clarifying rules for the benefit of junior officers.

The former city engineer said that three such circulars were challenged by a citizen in the Bombay high court in 1992. However, the high court had ruled that the circulars were in accordance with the DC rules.

7,Muslim law board meet from today,"PATNA: In the backdrop of the surcharged atmosphere prevailing in the country due to current round of Ayodhya controversy, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board will hold a two-day meeting here on Sunday to deliberate on the controversy so as to spread the message of national harmony and unity.

Reception committee chairman A A Hai said on Saturday that about 35 members of the board had already arrived in this connection.

9,Sebi tightens rules to check sub-brokers,"NEW DELHI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has barred sub-brokers from issuing ""contract notes"" and making payments by cheque directly for share transactions.

While barring the usual practice of issuing contract notes to investor, a sub-broker will now have to mandatorily enter into a ""tripartite agreement"" with a Sebi-registered broker and the client for any sale or purchase of securities.

The move comes after numerous instance of default in payment by brokers and sub-brokers to their clients in absence of a well-defined rule on agreement between the three parties.

Sebi has amended its Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers Regulations 1992 by inserting a clause that says ""a sub-broker shall enter into a tripartite agreement with his client and with the main broker specifying the scope of rights and obligations of the sub-broker, broker and such client of the sub-broker.""

The sub-broker would have to assist his clients in obtaining the contract note from the main broker but can not issue the note or make payments through cheques directly, which has to come from the main broker from now on.

Sebi has also directed brokers not to deal with any person acting as a sub-broker unless he is registered with the exchange and the regulator.

Moreover, sub-brokers would have to comply with the rules, regulations and by-laws of the exchange, Sebi said in its new regulation.

A sub-broker can not be affiliated to more than one broker of one exchange, it said.

10,Shinde govt moves SC,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging an order of the Bombay High Court, which dropped the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder framed against actor Salman Khan for killing one person and injuring four others in a hit-and-run case.

The petition, filed on October 16, would come up for hearing after October 27 when the apex court reopened after vacations, official sources said here on Sunday.

The actor will be defended by well known criminal lawyer Dipesh Mehta.

In view of this development, the trial in a magistrate''s court may not commence on October 21 and is likely to be adjourned until the Supreme Court decides the law point on whether the offence allegedly committed by the actor fell within the scope of section 304 (2) IPC, culpable homicide not amounting to murder which attracts 10 years'' jail term.

On October 6, a magistrate framed 10 charges against Salman, a year after he allegedly killed one person and injured four by ramming his vehicle into a bakery.

The actor pleaded not guilty to all the charges framed against him under provisions of IPC, Motor Vehicles Act and Bombay Prohibition Act and said he was ready to face trial.

Magistrate S Y Sishode rejected the state''s plea for staying the process of framing charges as it desired to prefer an appeal in the Supreme Court against an order of the Bombay High Court, which had dropped the charge of culpable homicide framed against the actor earlier.

He said that the state was free to move the apex court even after framing charges.

11,Kaun banega chief minister?,"NEW DELHI: Elections are the great crucible of a democracy. And they are like examinations for politicians, after all they are the ones being judged.

What elections mean: Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit has just completed a five-year term. ""For me, elections this time round is to keep in mind how Delhi has changed over the years,"" she said.

Delhi politics, according to her and the Delhi Congress spokesperson Jagdish Tytler has changed a lot over the years. ""There are new people coming into Delhi everyday, the electorate of Delhi has a changed profile now,"" Tytler says.

Delhi BJP chief Madan Lal Khurana however wants to stick to the tried and true election lingo. ""The elections will expose the misrule of the Congress at all levels, these elections will mean a referendum against the government,"" he says.

Leader of the opposition of the Delhi Assembly, Jagdish Mukhi had nothing more to add to what his state party chief said. ""After enduring it for five years, the people will pronounce judgement on the misrule of the Congress. This time round its just anti-Congressism,"" he stresses.

Issues to be picked up: For Dikshit the main issue is the shrinking of space in the city. ""Delhi has grown beyond imagination, and if in the next five years the economic boom which is propelling it, is not harnessed in the right way, this could well lead to chaos,"" she says.

Tytler puts a different spin to the whole thing, saying that the problem of resettlement colonies is the most burning issue.

""Lakhs of people come into the city everyday, we need their labour but are not prepared to accommodate them,"" he says. ""For this, the Master Plan should be implemented in toto. Land and police should be given to the state government,"" says Tytler.

Land and police: The handing over of land and police has long been demanded by successive Delhi governments, albeit half heartedly. On paper, though, the heinous rape of a Swiss diplomat has led to this rethink.

""We want VIP security to stay with the central government, but the policing pertaining to ordinary citizens should be handed over to the state government,"" says Dikshit.

BJP Delhi chief Madan Lal Khurana maintains a diplomatic silence on the issue of handing over land and law and order. ""We want capital punishment for rape and stringent policing,"" he says. ""Congress has no right to make an issue of crimes against women,"" he says.

Search still on for the issue: From the privatisation of the Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) to the water problem faced by large parts of Delhi, and now the dismal record of crime against women in the city, the issues in this election cover the whole gamut. Both parties are waiting for that election winning issue. The electorate is waiting for that winning candidate.

12,PM lashes out at Cong-ruled states for tardy progress,"BHOPAL: Accusing the Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere of not delivering the goods on development front, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Sunday said BJP should be voted back to power there so that these states and the Centre work ""in tandem"" for meaningful progress.

Kick-starting BJP''s campaign for December 1 Assembly polls in the state at a women''s rally here, Vajpayee said, ""the country has taken giant strides on the path to progress but the pace is still slow because of dismal show by Congress-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh.""

There are mountains of foodgrains in granaries of the country and foreign exchange reserve is at its peak but all achievements made by Centre are going in vain because of ""lack of cooperation and coordination by states like Madhya Pradesh. he said.

The Prime Minister said achievements made by the Centre would bear fruits if BJP is given power in states to work ""in tandem"", he said.

Hitting out at Digvijay Singh government for failing to lift Madhya Pradesh from ''BIMARU'' (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) status due to its ""inefficiency"", he said ""I am worried about situation here... How long the state will remain BIMARU?"".

He said there are abundant resources in the state but these are not being harnessed.

He alleged Madhya Pradesh had the dubious distinction of topping the number of rape cases and other atrocities against women.

Vajpayee charged atrocities on Dalits, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes were on the rise in Madhya Pradesh and various schemes launched by the Centre for the elevation of their status in society have become ""meaningless"" due to ""lack of seriousness"" on the part of states to implement them.

""We cannot remain silent spectators to these atrocities... It is for the people of the state to decide. The coming elections will give them an opportunity to ensure a new beginning. What could not be achieved in the past ten years can be achieved in the next five years,"" he said.

If the BJP-led government at the Centre can succeed in many areas because of its sincere efforts, the states should not lag behind provided they have the right government to translate development plans and welfare schemes into action, he said.

Slamming the state government for failing to initiate effective reforms in the power sector and check electricity theft, the Prime Minister said despite Centre''s help and assistance in stepping up power generation, states are not able to overcome shortage due to mismanagement.

Though road communication holds the key to development and prosperity, Madhya Pradesh government has neglected this sector causing sluggishness in trade and business, he claimed and said issues pertaining to development should be central to the entire electioneering.

13,"PM asks terrorists, Naxals to shun violence","BHOPAL: Asking terrorists and Naxalites to shun the path of violence, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Sunday said terrorism is a curse and when blended with religious fundamentalism it becomes deadly without achieving anything.

""Terrorism is a curse before mankind and when it is coupled with religious fundamentalism the menace becomes all the more dangerous. We have to fight it jointly despite all political differences,"" he said launching BJP''s election campaign at a women''s rally here.

Condemning attempts to embarrass the elected government in Jammu and Kashmir by frequent acts of terrorism, Vajpayee said notwithstanding apprehensions in several quarters, considerable change has been brought about in the state through peaceful means and holding of impartial elections.

The Prime Minister also asserted that Naxalites in Madhya Pradesh and other states would never succeed in achieving their goals through violent methods which have no place in democracy.

Misguided youths resorting to violence in the name of Naxalism should realise that no problem can be solved through violent means, he said.
