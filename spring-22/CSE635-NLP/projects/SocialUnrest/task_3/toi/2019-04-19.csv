1,MC polls: SAD-BJP may try BSP,"chandigarh: smitten by its defeat in the vidhan sabha elections, the sad-bjp alliance is likely to strike an alliance with the bsp in the coming elections to the four municipal corporations. state bjp president bl rinwa told mediapersons here on thursday that details of sharing of seats would be worked out in the near future.a state-level advisory committee would be constituted for the purpose, which would also hold consultations with the sad to decide on the number of seats to be shared. rinwa discounted reports that the outcome of the vidhan sabha elections, in which the bjp suffered a humiliating defeat in urban areas, would have any bearing on the corporation elections. he sounded optimistic of the bjp improving its electoral prospects, as the people had started getting disappointed with the congress. he said the congress had so far failed to keep the promises made in the manifesto, which had made people believe that it had nothing much to offer. rinwa reiterated that the sadbjp governmentâ€™s anti-urban bias was responsible for the bjpâ€™s defeat. state general secretary avinash jaiswal, meanwhile, denied reports that the party high command intended to replace rinwa due to the partyâ€™s dismal performance in the assembly elections. he said the criticism against him was mounted by disgruntled elements in the party. a two-day meeting of the state executive has been called on april 29 to assess the party preparedness for the corporation elections.while the national general secretary op kohli, who is also in charge of the state affairs, would preside over the meeting, national organising secretary sanjay joshi, would be the special invitee. earlier, a delegation led by national vice-president of the bjpâ€™s kisan morcha harjit singh grewal presented a memorandum to the state governor jfr jacob expressing concern over farmersâ€™ plight in the state.

2,No takers for govt’s word on rehabilitation,"new delhi: contrary to reports emanating from gujarat, the union health ministry claims that 62,000 people living in cramped conditions in 112 relief camps across the state are being well looked after through an efficient network of services and that the possibility of any epidemic has been checked through timely immunisation. union health minister c p thakur said that only eight cases of measles had been detected in five of the relief camps in gujarat, thanks to the governmentâ€™s effort at immunisation in these camps. addressing a news conference with gujarat health minister ashok bhatt, thakur also claimed that he had not received any reports of sexual violence against women in gujarat from the team of doctors and psychiatrists working there. their claim was sharply at variance with the findings of a fact-finding team of women activists which visited gujarat. the team found compelling evidence of the â€˜â€˜most extreme form of sexual violence against women during the first few days of carnage.â€™â€™ their report gives graphic first-person accounts of survivors in camps. both thakur and bhatt tried to dispel doubts about the conditions in the camps as they reeled off official data on the number of doctors working there, the disease profile of cases being treated as also the sanction of medicines worth rs 8.26 crore by the centre. even as bhatt tried to explain that the requirement of medicines worth rs 8.26 crore was â€˜â€˜normalâ€™â€™, officials in the health ministry said most people in these camps would not be in need of antibiotics or any expensive drugs. many of these people were displaced, not injured, they said. the funnelling of drugs by the centre could well be a way of making â€˜â€˜money out of misery,â€™â€™ the officials alleged. thakur also tried to impress on the newspersons that women and others in these relief camps were being taken to specialised hospitals as and when the need arose. so, he said, only one delivery had taken place in a camp; for all the others, women had been rushed to hospitals. bhatt said ambulance services had been provided outside four major camps. later, a presentation by a representative of the red cross that talked about women preferring to deliver in the camp instead of going to hospitals â€” while showing photographs of new- born children â€” had thakur and bhatt scrambling to â€˜explainâ€™ that the women had come back soon after delivering in the hospital.

5,HC pulls up govt on tax evasion,"patna: a division bench of the patna high court comprising chief justice ravi s dhavan and justice shashank k singh on thursday pulled up the state government in a pil, filed by ajay kumar singh, mla, alleging government connivance in the evasion of sales tax running into hundreds of crore by a liquor company. the bench asked the government to study its own affidavit (cwjc no. 7024/99) and the report of the (then) chief secretary, v s dubey, on the issue. a division bench of chief justice ravi s dhavan and justice aftab alam had forced the government in 1999 to inquire and rescind the contract awarded to the proxy firm of a concern which had defaulted on sales tax. additional advocate general s k ghosh assured the court that the government will never allow such a thing and will take all steps to thwart the evasion of taxes. he assured of positive action in this regard by april 29, the next date of the hearing. the bench said it cannot understand how the government could be so casual in a matter of evasion of such huge revenue. justice singh said that the son cannot be allowed to float a dummy company and avoid the tax demand on the company run by his father. justice dhavan also felt that the company floated by the son is only a camouflage and the government has to be alert to check revenue lapses. the petition has cited the example of a few firms and persons, like k d liquor & fertilisers, ally food pvt limited, sanjay kumar and rewati international pvt limited which have been allowed to cheat the government of tax revenue amounting to hundred of crore. the petition says that the excise department was aware of the tax evasion of these concerns and has yet connived with them to facilitate them in getting liquor licenses. the petition said that the people of bihar has a vital stake in the revenue as it caters to large number of public need like education and medicare and its loss will jeopardise the government spending on them. counsel for the petitioner rajendra singh asked the bench for invocation of the public recovery demand act against the defaulters and stern action against the excise officials for facilitating this charade. he said the excise department is a den of corruption which works only in the interest of tax evaders. the rules categorically forbid tax defaulters from participating in liquor bids by governments and yet these concerns have been allowed to participate in the process, he added.

7,Police warn against investment firms,"vijayawada: police commissioner n v surendra babu on thursday cautioned people against investment companies operating in the city. the commissionerâ€™s caution, made at a press conference here, comes in the wake of a complaint by a person named nune nageswara rao, a resident of vidyadharapuram, against two new delhi-based sister-concern companies, pearls agritech corporation limited (pacl) and pearls green forests limited (pgf). nageswara rao alleged that the pgf cheated him by not paying the promised 15 per cent interest on his investment of rs 9,000. instead, the company offered a plot of 150 sq yrds. after investigating the case, the police closed the case against the company for want of evidence. but the investigations revealed that the companies that were not registered either with the reserve bank of india (rbi) or the securities and exchanges board of india (sebi), collected a whopping rs 143 crore as deposits from 1.42 lakh customers across the country. in vijayawada, the companies collected rs 14 crore as deposits in the last two years from 12,500 customers. the companies claim that they have property in tamil nadu, punjab, haryana, maharashtra and nirmal in andhra pradesh to distribute it to investors in case of a cash crunch. so far they have allotted a 150-sq yrd plot to each of the 86,000 customers. they are yet to distribute land to another 16,000 customers. police investigations revealed that the sebi had served notices to 605 companies in 1998 to get themselves registered with the regulatory authority. however, the pacl obtained a stay against the sebi order from the rajasthan high court, while the pgf obtained a similar order from the chandigarh high court.

8,Missions don’t take govt’s word,"new delhi: the government has claimed that the international community has expressed its â€˜â€˜understandingâ€™â€™ over the events in gujarat, but the diplomatic community is concerned and worried. interactions with a cross-section of diplomats show that the governmentâ€™s claims that â€˜â€˜most governments have expressed their understanding of the manner in which we are dealing with the situationâ€™â€™ in so far as â€˜â€˜effective steps are being taken to restore peace and stability â€˜â€™ are completely belied by facts. though only a few are willing to raise the issue in bilateral interaction with the government, none is willing to go public with the criticism on â€˜â€˜internal affairsâ€™â€™, and every mission has been monitoring the developments in the state. they are collecting information, interacting with independent observers and ngos, and many missions have sent their independent teams. a senior diplomat from one of the friendly countries was worried rather than critical. â€˜â€˜indiaâ€™s prestige that was sky high, has sunk so low.â€™â€™ claiming that gujarat has created a problem for the friendly countries. â€˜â€˜if we raise the issue of cross-border terrorism, pakistan will turn around and point a finger at the internal terrorism within india. on what grounds do we defend india and accuse pakistan?â€™â€™ the diplomat asks. the governmentâ€™s efforts to reach out through its missions and â€˜explainâ€™ the aberrations as a fallout of the â€˜â€˜complexities of a pluralistic societyâ€™â€™ have not cut much ice. few buy the governmentâ€™s argument that it acted decisively to quell the violence. though no one is keen to take up the issue publicly as western countries did in the past on human rights abuses in kashmir, the silence is not a sign of consent. â€˜â€˜these are internal affairs of the country. what can we say?â€™â€™ asks a western diplomat.

14,Kerala minister in trouble over vanishing forests,"thiruvananthapuram: the denudation of 3,000 acres of forestland has rocked the kerala government, with allegations that a minister''s kin were involved in the felling spree. thick evergreen forests over 3,000 acres at mathikettan mala in idukki district, 150 km from kottayam, have reportedly disappeared. and there are allegations that revenue minister k.m. mani''s relatives and friends were involved. the issue surfaced when forest minister k. sudhakaran received a series of complaints from environmentalists. he made a surprise visit to the area and was shocked to find that the complaints were true. the forest felling issue was raised at the cabinet meeting here wednesday. sudhakaran, a first time minister, and mani, one of the seniormost political leaders in kerala, apparently locked horns over the matter, sending the local media into a tizzy. to control the damage, sudhakaran immediately called a press conference to deny that he and mani had clashed. ""close to 3,000 acres of forest has been razed and those involved in the land grab include the brother of idukki district chief t.j. mathew,"" sudhakaran said. ""big houses have been built on this land now. i was surprised to hear that mathew had assured the encroachers that they would be given title deeds for the encroached land."" demands for mani''s resignation have begun to come in from several quarters. opposition legislator p.c. george of kerala congress-j said he had given documentary evidence of the forest razing in the form of a videocassette to assembly speaker vakkom purushothaman just before the budget session and had also lodged a complaint with chief minister a.k. antony.

15,Vikhe-Patil blasts CM's `anti-farmer' policies,"mumbai: in a blatant disregard for protocols and conventions, union minister of state for finance balasaheb vikhe-patil, who belongs to the shiv sena, has written a terse letter to maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh to protest against the congress state government''s ``anti-farmer'''' decisions.

the state government''s recent decisions were ``retrograde'''' and not in tune with the state''s progressive image, said the letter. ``if immediate action is not taken to rectify the situation, the state government could face a serious agitation by the people,'''' mr vikhe-patil has warned.

the letter assumes significance in light of the state''s precarious financial situation and mr vikhe-patil''s recent statement that he could get the state economy back on track within six months if given the chance.

the letter lists the following as the state''s ``social problems'''': remunerative prices for farm produce have not been fixed, there was a water shortage in most parts and there was little institutional assistance available to farmers. ``in such a situation, you should be taking the decisions that can be helpful to the farmers and not hurting them,'''' he told the chief minister.

the state government''s decision to charge farmers for power supply has also irked mr vikhe-patil. farmers had so far been charged on a horse-power basis, but they now have to pay as per the meter. ``when it has been established that power thefts take place in urban and not in rural parts, it would be unfair to criticise farmers for losses of the electricity board. this had been accepted by the maharashtra electricity regulatory commission. therefore, it would not be sufficient that farmers were supplied with power on a horse-power basis,'''' said the letter. the minister has, in fact, recommended that power should be provided free of cost for agricultural purposes.

the state government''s decision to privatise irrigation projects has also drawn flak. mr vikhe-patil has described the decision as ``anti-social, unjust to farmers and an attempt to turn the clock backwards''''. he has told mr deshmukh that such a decision was withdrawn in canada in 1983 following public outcry. privatisation of ``public wealth'''' like water resources in the state would be opposed tooth and nail, he has further said.

the state should not do away with the concept of a welfare state, he said. ``the new philosophy is that one should pay for every service. but this is not in keeping with the humanitarian and welfare concept,'''' he added. ``does this mean that the poor should bring up their children without education or that they perish without medicines. while social security measures were being strengthened all over the world, these were threatened in maharashtra,'''' the letter said.
