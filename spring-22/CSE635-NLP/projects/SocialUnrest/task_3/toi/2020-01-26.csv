0,Moorthy's incentive for 'good work',"LUCKNOW: Minister of state for railways A K Moorthy announced an award of Rs one lakh each for both NR and NER considering the measures already taken to improve the services and the premises.

At a press conference, keeping in mind the heavy rush of passengers, Moorthy also noted down a suggestion to extend the Lucknow-Bhopal train to Poona. Moreover, long distance trains would have an additional coach for housing mini-theatres, he announced.

To start with, Moorthy proposed one train from Lucknow and one south-borne train could have this facility. Mobile phone charging points, hair-cutting saloons and other facilities would also be soon introduced in trains, he promised.

Moorthy highlighted the progress made by the Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) on passenger amenity ideas that were proposed by him. The RDSO has come up with a special cradle for babies, complete with brackets and locking pins designed so as to make them safe from injury.

A power-efficient 450 mm sweep fan had also been designed, said Moorthy, that would increase airflow by approximately 20 per cent. Modular toilets have also been developed with additional facilities like water jets giving greater convenience to passengers.

Meanwhile, in a memorandum submitted to the minister, the All India Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Railway Employees Association requested for action on the demands made during his earlier visit on October 25, 2002.

1,Rly minister carries out surprise inspection,"LUCKNOW: The visit of minister of state for railways AK Moorthy, who arrived at the Charbagh railway station for inspection, was a boon for both the Charbagh railway station and the NER station.

A fine of Rs 50 will now be imposed from today on people who were found relieving themselves at places other than the toilets. He directed officials to launch a month-long drive for sanitation and for improving the security and safety at the station.

Right after inaugurating the electronic train information display board at the Charbagh railway station, Moorthy started checking the most unusual places, focusing on the minutest detail.

Officials got the shock of their lives at platform one, when he jumped from the platform to inspect the tracks for safety. No official was allowed to accompany him as he started checking the bolts and clips.

He looked in disbelief when one of the ''pandroll clips'' used to fasten tracks came into his hands. What followed was obviously uncomfortable for the staff responsible for ensuring that the clips were properly tightened.

Moorthy inspected all the platforms and even entered a Memu train that was an eye opener for him as the train was filthy and the light bulbs were all broken. He went to staff quarters where he sat down to talk to employees, followed by a visit to the reservation building where he directed officials to install a music system and a television set.

He again went to the station to check toilets and directed officials to construct a urinal for women. He also checked waiting rooms and restaurant, even tasting food being prepared in kitchen.

The minister went to the subway, where he found cause for concern. Besides improper illumination, the water that had collected at many places due to seepage was enough for a warning issued to the chief health inspector (CHI).

Directing the CHI to be careful in future, Moorthy said that he was not being suspended so that he would have another chance to mend his ways.

Moorthy went to the NER station where he checked facilities especially meant for disabled people, like proper height of the board used to display passenger reservation charts and toilet, where he went inside to see the condition. He also tested public telephones and even checked book-stalls for obscene literature.

5,Act tough against Bangladeshis: Togadia to govt,"NEW DELHI: Expressing serious concern over infiltration from Bangladesh and alleged atrocities on Hindus in that country, the VHP on Sunday threatened to launch a mass agitation on the issue if the government failed to get tough.

""It is time that the Centre takes concrete steps to tackle infiltration from Bangladesh or face the music,"" Pravin Togadia, VHP''s international general secretary, told a private news channel, according to a release issued by the channel.

Asserting that people would no longer tolerate becoming refugees in their own country, Togadia said that VHP would launch a mass agitation against Bangladeshi infiltrators if the problem was not solved soon.

""We will not sit in peace and fight till our last drop of blood to chase all the infiltrators in West Bengal and Assam,"" Togadia, who recently visited the border states, said.

He criticised the Congress for its ""silence"" on infiltration and accused the politicial parties of ducking the issue in order to remain in power on Muslim votes.

""While all countries in the world are cracking down on infiltrators, we are issuing them ration cards and giving them voting rights. This is the worst form of vote bank politics as it is at the cost of national security,"" he lamented.

Accusing the border states, particularly West Bengal, of ""inaction"", the VHP leader said that the situation was worsening day by day. About three crore illegal Bangladeshi nationals were already in India and the figure would touch 10 crore by 2020, he warned.

Togadia alleged that anti-India forces were conspiring to create a ''Greater Bangladesh'', which would include parts of West Bengal, Assam and North Bihar.
