1,BJP-Sena to hold protests at CM's function on Friday,"PUNE: In the ongoing controversy over the 60-foot-wide road passing through the Bharti Vidyapeeth campus at Dhankawadi, the BJP and the Shiv Sena have threatened to hold demonstrations outside the college on June 6.

Announcing this at a press conference here on Wednesday, BJP-Sena corporators said the demonstrations would be staged when chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde arrives at the campus to unveil a newly-installed statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

The corporators have threatened to stage a hunger strike and, on June 9, move court against the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) for not making the road available to thousands of citizens.

â€œEverytime Patangrao Kadam, state industries minister and chancellor of the deemed university, visits the campus, we will wave black flags. This will continue till the time the issue is resolved,â€� they said.

The controversial road is part of the cityâ€™s 1987 development plan. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has gone ahead and built a Rs 1.5 crore vehicular subway at the Pune-Satara road to facilitate access to the road.

The road is crucial to residents of Ambegaon-Pathar and adjoining areas. However, they are being denied access by the university authorities.

â€œWe cannot allow such huge planned expenditure to go waste and thousands of citizens to be harassed, just because of political pressureâ€� the BJP-Sena corporators said.

The affected citizens have formed the Bharati Vidyapeeth Road Bachao Samiti and served a legal notice to municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar.

2,Doctors behind primitive state of govt hospitals,"DHARWAD: Government doctors are partly responsible for the pitiful state of affairs in state hospitals, which despite their huge infrastructure, are unable to provide state-of-the-art facilities to ordinary patients.

For on the side, they run a lucrative business in the form of private hospitals and clinics. They take advantage of the fact that both the affluent and common classes prefer private hospitals.

These institutions, run by influential personalities and government doctors, are flush with funds and lure people with modern facilities. Karnataka minister for health and information Kagodu Thimmappa, during his recent visit to a district civil hospital in Dharwad, found that a sum of Rs 7 lakh provided by the Karnataka government to buy modern equipment had remained unutilised.

â€œItâ€™s clear that doctors do not want government hospitals to provide hi-tech facilities as this will put an end to their extra income,â€� said Charantimath, a Congress leader who accompanied the minister. According to him, there is no dearth of patients thronging government hospitals, including the civil hospital, ESI hospitals and primary (community) health centres in Hubli-Dharwad. The only problem is they have to shell out hefty fees for these services, which would have been affordable were they available at a government hospital.

There are many super-speciality fields which are either not available or are in a poor state in civil hospitals. These include cardiology and neurosurgery, for which patients have to depend on the private sector. Many are forced to seek the services of diagnostic centres, which flourish here because of the growth of both population and demand. As competition increases, private players hire PR agencies, and a few even circulate pamphlets and advertisement material regularly, stating the facilities available and what they cost.

The state of government health services today can be gauged by the fact that even a common person prefers to visit a private hospital. â€œIn a majority of cases, government hospitals have become just referral centres,â€� says Basavaraj Hiremath, a social activist. Although crores of rupees have been spent on upgrading facilities to treat burns cases in the civil hospital here, patients are referred to private hospitals. He alleged that the apathetic attitude of the doctors and staff is responsible for affluent patients avoiding government hospitals. But this has left the poor in the lurch, as they depend on ill-equipped government hospitals, he feels.

Apathy at civil hospitals comes in the form of shortage of staff, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, while diagnostic and testing facilities are also not up to the mark. Facilities like CT scan and MRI are not available in any civil hospital in the region. X-ray and ultrasound facilities are not always available to patients, who are forced to visit private centres.

Medicines are also in short supply, Hiremath said. The district, which reports dozens of accidents, some of them very serious, has no trauma centre. â€œThough the demand has been raised many a time, there is no move to set up any such centre in the near future,â€� he rued.

3,"Cong govts to cooperate on power, tourism: CM","BATHINDA: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said here on Thursday that the chief ministers of Punjab, Uttaranchal, Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh were pondering over the idea of working jointly on a combined programme in the fields of electricity generation and tourism promotion.

This idea was mooted for the first time during a Congress chief ministersâ€™ conclave held recently at Srinagar. Amarinder told mediapersons that as hydel projects were cheap, a proposal was made at the conclave to map the hydel power generation potential of the hill states for the benefit of states like Punjab.

He said that while the hill states had the potential of attracting tourists in summers, similar was the case in winters for states in the plains like Punjab.

He said a consensus should evolve on a common tourism policy and hydel power projects, keeping in view both short-term and long-term gains.

The chief minister said that state government had deferred the abolition of octroi for the time being as a cross-section of traders and entrepreneurs had made various representations to the state government, asking it to reconsider Local Area Development Tax (LADT), which was proposed to replace the existing system of octroi.

He said that LADT being an effective tool for resource mobilisation and to check tax evasion, the government was expected to net revenue to the tune of Rs 720 crore from LADT, whereas octroi fetch Rs 580 crore.

Clarifying the governmentâ€™s stand on the issue of the alleged arrest of the farmers for the non-payment of their agriculture loans in Bathinda and Muktsar districts, he said that only those farmers were being arrested who had borrowed the loan for non-agriculture purpose.

Lauding the trend of â€˜â€˜unanimousâ€™â€™ elections in village panchayats in the forthcoming elections, Amarinder announced that such panchayats would be eligible for special developmental grants. The chief minister was accompanied by AICC general secretary Ambika Soni and Phillaur MP Santosh Chaudhary.

4,TRS chalks out its own rally,"HYDERABAD: After the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party yatras, it is now the turn of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) to take recourse to yatras.

TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao would take out a 10-day motor cycle rally in the ten districts of the Telangana region highlighting the governmentâ€™s â€˜indifferent attitudeâ€™ in implementing recommendations of the House committee on G0 610 violations.

According to sources, Chandrasekhar Rao would kick start his rally on June 11 or 12 coinciding with the TDPâ€™s Janachaitanya yatras scheduled to start from June 12. The TRS president would cover all the districts in 10 days and travel over 200 km a day in a district.

Chandrasekhar Rao would ask the people to â€˜gheraoâ€™ TDP leaders during the Janachaitanya yatras over the failure of the government to implement the recommendations of the House committee, which called for repatriation of non-locals working in the region to their res pective zones. The TRS leaders and its political affairs committee were chalking out a schedule of the tour, sources said.

Meanwhile, TRS public representatives forum chairman and Medak MP A Narendra underwent an open heart surgery at a private hospital in the city on Thursday. Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS general secretaries M Kishen Rao, K Dayanad and family members of Narendra were present at the hospital during the surgery.

TRS leaders and supporters of Narendra offered prayers at various temples, including Skandagiri temple, Ujjain Mahankali temple and others, for the leaderâ€™s speedy recovery, a TRS release said.

5,"Issues of water, power may dominate polls again","PATHANKOT: Drinking water and power supply are likely to be the poll planks for both the Congress and the SADBJP coalition for the coming panchayat polls and the Lok Sabha elections to be held next year.

While both housing and urban development minister Raghunath Sahai Puri and Congress MLA Ashok Sharma had won the elections on the promise that they would make drinking water available in all villages of their r e s p e c t ive constituencies, Sujanpur and Pathankot, villagers in the kandi belt continue to complain of power cuts and shortage of drinking water.

If the BJP is taking credit for the 72 deep bores got dug by former minister Satya Pal Saini in Sujanpur during the Badal regime, former education minister Mohan Lal is claiming credit for making drinking water available in villages of Dhar Kalan, which form a part of the constituency.

Despite some good work to their credit, the BJP candidates lost probably because of the anti-incumbency factor.

Puri and Sharma had promised sarpanches during the assembly elections that if the Congress came to power, they would ask the government to waive the panchayat t u b ewe l l connection bills and to provide free water supply.

On the c o n t r a r y, when the Amarinder government took over not only free power and water supply to the f a r m e r s were stopped, additional water charges were levied. To top it all, the recent hike in electricity tariff has them fuming.

Talking to Times News Network, Pathankot executive engineer (public health) A K Sehgel said while most of the disgruntled panchayats had cut off their tubewell connections due to non-payment of bills, they are relying on kundi system to get water for their daily needs in the absence of eight hours of regular power supply, as promised by the government.

In the process, the problem of drinking water has become more acute, he said.

Though there has been a good response to the Swaijaldhara scheme, a centrally sponsored scheme to supply water announced by minister of state for external affairs and Gurdaspur BJP MP Vinod Khanna, the scheme not being on the concurrent list seems to have hit roadblocks.

While Sehgel said that according to highly-placed officials they could avail central funds only for bridges and not drinking water, Khannaâ€™s OSD Arun Malhotra said the officials were not implementing the central scheme at the behest of some ministers. The local public health office is supposed to supply estimates for the tubewells meant for villages.

Malhotra said Khanna would meet chief minister Amarinder Singh shortly to seek cooperation of his government in fulfilling the scheme in 1,600 villages of Gurdaspur district.

The Punjab government is also running a Nabardfunded drinking water scheme in kandi areas, which has yet not been able to provide sufficient water to villagers.

Malhotra, who visited Ghoh village along with Satya Pal Saini and Swaijaldhara project manager Sukrit Sharda, said the BJP was planning to install deep bore tubewells in all the villages of the district and the response from villagers had been tremendous.

6,Ex-minister denies charges of promoting dissidence,"HOSHIARPUR: Former minister Naresh Thakur and District Congress Committee president Kuldip Nanda appeared before the disciplinary action committee (DAC) at the Congress Bhavan in Chandigarh.

The two had been summoned by the DAC following Kuldip Nandaâ€™s allegation that sitting MP Charanjit Channi and Thakur had promoted dissidence during the election to the post of the Municipal Council president, whereby the rebel Congress candidate had managed to win the coveted post. Channi had already appeared before the committee on May 23.

While speaking to Times News Network, Nasib Singh Gill, DAC chairman said that Thakur has denied the charges. According to Gill, it had been alleged that Naresh had influenced three councillors including Arvind Sharma, Krishna Saini and Kamaljeet Kaur to abstain from voting for the official Congress candidate Brij Mohan Batra. Gill said that Thakur had refuted these charges by claiming that Kamaljeet Kaurâ€™s ticket was not recommended by him while Krishna Sainiâ€™s candidature had been acceptable to all Congresspersons as she was already a sitting councillor.

According to Gill, the former minister had claimed that confusion had prevailed in the minds of the three councillors as to who was the official Congress candidate as Batra had rebelled against the official Congress candidate when elections were held on the first day before being postponed due to high-drama.

Thakur had also alleged that Batra was unacceptable to the people as there were allegations that Batra would misuse the position since he was a dealer of a soft drink company.

Gill said that Nanda in his meeting had termed Thakurâ€™s claims as a bunch of lies and had struck to his stance that had the three councillors owing allegiance to Thakur voted for the official Congress candidate, Brij Mohan Batra would not have lost. According to the DAC president, Nanda had also claimed that Naresh Thakur had made recommendations for Kamaljeet Kaurâ€™s ticket.

Gill said that the committee has asked Nanda to get the records of all the recommendations made during the allocation of the MC tickets.

Gill added that if the charges made Nanda proved to be true the DAC would initiate disciplinary action as per the constitution of the party against the guilty.

7,6 arrested for robberies in Howrah,"HOWRAH: The district police on Thursday arrested six men in connection with two separate incidents of robbery.

There was a robbery at a garments showroom on GT Road recently. Uttam Shah, the owner of the shop, found worth a few lakhs missing when he opened it. He filed an FIR with the police.

8,By-elections an acid test for Trinamool,"KOLKATA: The Nabadwip Lok Sabha by-election on Sunday will be an acid test for the Trinamul Congress.

Party leaders said that its outcome may well this may well determine the Trinamul Congressâ€™ status within the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

With a resounding defeat at the recent panchayat polls and no electoral success to show for after the Panskura Lok Sabha by-election a few years back, a defeat at Nabadwip could just be the beginning of the end for the Trinamul.

Its lone Rajya Sabha MP Jayanta Bhattacharya, who won as an Independent but was a prominent Trinamul leader, has already returned to the Congress.

Rebel Lok Sabha MP Ajit Panja, though still officially with the Trinamul, is openly participating in Congress-sponsored programmes. And Sudip Bandyopadhyay was the last of the MPs to discard loyalty and part company with mercurial party chief Mamata Banerjee when she prevented him from joining the Union ministry.

Mamataâ€™s camping at Nabadwip with the entire party top brass for the last one week shows her desperation to win this election, pointed out Trinamul insiders on Thursday. The death of the fourth Trinamul MP from Nabadwip, Ananda Mohan Biswas, has brought down the partyâ€™s strength in Parliament from nine to five.

Now, if she failed to ensure victory for Biswasâ€™ son Abir, her importance in the NDA will be that much reduced, claimed insiders.

With the Trinamul-BJP combine facing certain defeat at Vidyasagar, a defeat at Nabadwip will prove beyond doubt that the Trinamul is on the way out as the principal Opposition in the state with the Congress surely filling up that space, stated insiders.

Mamata is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee after the by-election to negotiate the partyâ€™s entry into the Union Cabinet. But she will have little for bargaining if she goes to Delhi with nothing to show coupled with deputy prime minister L.K. Advani still smarting from her adverse comments.

Rattled at the manner in which Vajpayee publicly expressed his desire to relegate leadership to Advani before the next Lok Sabha polls, the Trinamul issued a statement on Thursday saying it did not want any change in the NDA leadership.

â€œLeadership of the BJP is its internal matter. But being an NDA constituent, we accept Vajpayeeâ€™s leadership and are committed to NDAâ€™s common programme of governance,â€� said senior Trinamul leader Saugata Roy.

â€œAny deviation from this will have to be considered afresh and the party will decide on it as and when such changes occur,â€� he quipped.

The cabinet granted extension to 22 referral hospitals, 683 primary health centres, 27 district training groups running under the State Health and Family Welfare Institute, Sheikhpura, Patna and Regional Health Family Welfare Centres at Darbhanga and Bhagalpur for the current financial period at an estimated cost of Rs 44.97 crore.

Approval was also granted to the resolution for convening the 11th session of the present Bihar Vidhan Sabha from June 20 and 146th session of the Bihar Vidhan Parishad from June 24 respectively. While the assembly session would conclude on July 30, the Vidhan Parishad''s session would conclude on July 31.

10,Chief minister plea to conserve environment,"PATNA: Workshops, group discussions, lectures and slogan contests marked the World Environment Day on Thursday.

Chief minister Rabri Devi appealed to people to make a positive contribution towards conserving the environment. She said that the largescale denudation of forests and lack of pollution control measures had adversely affected nature and ecological balance.

Water and air were also getting polluted endangering our life, she said. Speaking at a function jointly organised by the forest department and state pollution control board the minister for forest and environment, Jagadanand Singh, warned the people of frightening consequences of increasing pollution and asked the people to be careful and lend their helping hand in the governmentâ€™s effort to pollution control.

â€œIf the pollution control board fails to bring down the pollution level in the state he would not attend such function from the next year,â€� said Singh. A group discussion-cum-slogan writing competition was also organised by Sarathi Foundation at Khagaul on the occasion.

About 50 schoolchildren participated in the slogan contest while about a dozen students took part in the group discussion on â€œProtect our Environmentâ€�. Suraksha Foundation organised a workshop on â€œEcological and Socio-Economic Problems and Future Strategiesâ€�. Speaking on the occasion, Patna University vice chancellor K K Jha stressed the causes of environmental pollution and blamed developed countries for it. He said schoolchildren should be imparted conservation training.

11,"One killed, 12 hurt in city riot","HYDERABAD: A minor dispute over payment for a cup of tea at a cafe led to a riot at Mallepally in which one person was killed and ten injured on Thursday afternoon. Mohammed Ghouse, an MIM activist, succumbed in hospital to injuries suffered in the clash. The injured, a couple of police officers among them, were treated as out-patients at Osmania General Hospital.

Trouble broke out at about 1 pm when two groups incensed by a petty quarrel began to pelt stones at each other in Habeebnagar locality. Police rushed to the scene and opened one round of fire in the air to scatter the mobs.

In the evening, trouble spilled over to Nampally with some groups of youth stoning five buses and breaking the glass panes of vehicles. A textile shop was raided and the ownerâ€™s scooter burnt.

Prohibitory orders were imposed and six platoons of police personnel deployed in the evening in parts of Habeebnagar and Asifnagar

Director-general of police P Ramulu and police commissioner M V Krishna Rao visited the affected areas late in the evening, and senior officers were monitoring the situation. Members of the two groups involved in the clash narrated conflicting versions.

Habeebnagar residents said it all started when a young man from Mangar Basti went to Ya Ghouse Hotel for a cup of tea at around 8.30 am. The man did not pay for the tea; instead, he abused the workers and broke a cup. The man fled when the hotel staff tried to take him to task.

In the afternoon, a group of men in a funeral procession from Mangar Basti pelted stones on the hotel, owner Mohammed Moazzam Ali told reporters. His workers retaliated. Mohammed Ghouse, a local MIM leader, tried to pacify the clashing groups but he sustained a head injury and was rushed to a private hospital, Ali said.

Residents of Mangar Basti, on the other hand, said the hotel owner and his supporters tried to stab two of the funeral processionists, Bheem and Reenabai, who had gone into the hotel to drink some water. Both persons sustained minor cuts, they said, adding that the procession carried on unmindful of the incident.

But on the way back, some of them attacked the hotel and ransacked it. A group, allegedly headed by Ghouse, retaliated by pelting stones.

12,Four die in suicide pact,"HYDERABAD: In what police suspect as a suicide pact, four of a businessmanâ€™s family were found hanging at their house in Gyanbagh Colony in Shahinayatgunj area in the city on Thursday.

The Shahinayatgunj police identified the dead as Vinod Kedia, 33, his wife Indu Devi Kedia, 30 and sons Kunal Kedia, 9 and Kushal Kedia, 8. Vinod was the owner of Kedia Plywoods at Topekhana in Begum Bazar.

Police said the incident came to light when Mohan, a sales boy at Kedia Plywoods went to Vinod Kediaâ€™s house as usual to get the shop keys. He knocked on the door several times and also called Vinodâ€™s mobile phone but there was no response. Mohan passed on the information to Vinodâ€™s brother Arun Kedia who reached the place and sought police help.

Shahinayatgunj police broke open the door and found the bodies of Vinod and his sons hanging from the ceiling in the hall and the body of his wife Indu Devi Kedia in the bedroom.

Kedia family sources said that Vinod had moved out of the joint family about five years ago. He had borrowed several lakhs of rupees from money lenders for his business, they said. But he was unable to repay as his customers had not cleared the pending bills running into lakhs of rupees, due to which he was under pressure.

Probably that may have forced him to take the extreme step, sources said. Indu, a native of Nagpore married Vinod in 1991.

13,"PUC checks only for commoners, not govt vehicles","AHMEDABAD/SURAT: Pollution Under Control (PUC), the yellow documents that certifies that your vehicle is environment friendly, seems only for the commoners.

On World Environment Day, TNN found vehicles of senior government officials including the police disregarding this otherwise mandatory procedure. The poor condition of police mobile vans and official vehicles allocated to 30 police stations had prompted the Ahmedabad commissioner of police, K R Kaushik, to call for a PUC drive in police headquarters.

This drive however ensured that the top brass of city police rode in PUC cars and jeeps while a large part of the police vehicles remained as polluting as ever.

â€œThis vehicle had been bought about three years back and PUC test was carried out on this only once. But, who will check us, PUC is not required for police vehicles,â€� quipped the driver of a police mobile vehicle parked at the police commissionerate in Shahibaug. This problem however has been taken up by the commissioner.

The drive to have police vehicles go through PUC tests was restarted on the World Environment Day. â€œI have asked the additional CP (headquarters) to ensure that all official vehicles of city police get a PUC test done,â€� Kaushik said. Among the vehicles at the Ahmedabad district collectorate, very few vehicles have PUC. â€œNobody stops us for any checks or even ask us for such documents,â€� quipped the driver of the vehicle of a senior government official.

B a -naskantha collector Kam a l Dayaniâ€™s car (GJ 8 1111) was last checked for a PUC certificate 18 years ago, informed his driver Babuji Thakore. District development officer (DDO) CS Patelâ€™s car (GJ 8 1242) too has not been checked for the last one-and-a-half years. â€œCan anyone tell a lion his mouth smells foul? We cannot question what our senior officers do,â€� says Banaskantha RTO RN Patel.

Driver of Junagadh collector Rohit Pathakâ€™s car (GJ 11 G 1000), Meranbahi Dangar, refused to show the PUC certificate. Nor is the certificate pasted on the windscreen.

â€œThis car belongs to the district collector. You cannot expect us to move around like ordinary men,â€� Dangar said. NR Gadhvi, driver of Junagadh district superintendent of police (DSP) RJ Savaniâ€™s car too refused to show the PUC certificate of the vehicle.

â€œThe DSPâ€™s office pays the required amount every year,â€� said Gadhvi.

In Surat, driver Ashokbhai Dattu was on duty on Thursday afternoon, manning the police mobile riot control van (GJ 5G 252). When asked about the PUC or a copy of that, he said he did not have the same and that all such documents would be with the motor transport (MT) section at Athwalines.

When contacted, MT incharge sub-inspector D C Contractor said that for each vehicle a separate history sheet is maintained and as when required PUCs are updated as well. But, when asked specifically, he admitted that there could be lapses in renewal of PUCs, in some cases.

In almost all of the city police vehicles, keeping PUCs or a copy of that is not a common practice. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) K L N Rao said that since drivers are on shift not kept in the vehicles, for the fear of their getting lost.

Private vehicle owners however are expected to show their PUC certificate whenever asked for.

Says Yatinbhai, manning the PUC centre at Chowpatty which is nearest to the MT section, â€œGovernment vehicles hardly come to me for PUCs.â€� Needless to say, driver of a vehicle parked nearby (GJ 5 G 555), allotted to superintending engineer Surat irrigation circle, when asked about PUC, said he was not aware of it.

However, Vinubhai Gamit who drives the Surat district collectorâ€™s Ambassador GJ G 9999, keeps updating the PUC as and when required. The present one is valid upto June 30.
