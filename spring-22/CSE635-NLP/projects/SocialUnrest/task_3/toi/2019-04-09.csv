5,Police assailed for Akola violence,"nagpur: state minorities commission chairman m.a. khandwani, who led a team of fellow members to the riot-affected akola city, has squarely blamed the police and the district administration for their failure in handling the situation in the communally-sensitive area. with the recovery of another body on friday last, the toll in the march 30 riots has gone up to seven. the policeâ€™s claim that the deceased was not a riot victim was rejected by mr khandwani at a press conference here on monday. except for a woman from the majority community who was stabbed to death, all others died in police firing. justifying the police action in opening fire twice in the old city areas, the areaâ€™s superintendant of police had said that if drastic action had not been taken, the situation would have turned worse and caused more deaths and damage. but, apparently, the state minorities commission has drawn a contrary conclusion after a daylong hearing of people from akola. mr khandwani accused the police of firing on the rioters without trying to control them by using teargas and lathis.

6,West Bengal not immune to violence: CM,"kolkata: west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee is ashamed of his gujarat counterpartâ€™s role in handling the recent carnage in the western state. he alleged that narendra modi had allowed the administration to remain inactive as right-wing militants butchered entire families belonging to the minority community. â€œas a chief minister, i feel ashamed when another chief minister describes the gujarat carnage as a revenge for the godhra incident,â€� bhattacharjee said on monday at a left front organised rally to raise funds for riot victims. â€œthe prime minister, too, has said that he is ashamed. but the entire country feels ashamed when the prime minister refuses to remove the modi government in gujarat,â€� he added. at the fund-collection drive, perhaps the most precious donation came from sheikh mohammed iqbal, a class six student, who gave rs 1001. he had saved the money from his tiffin allowance. singer ruma guha thakurta, actor subhendu chattopadhyay, economist amiya bagchi and several other artists and intellectuals were present at the programme to raise funds. the chief minister, in his address, indicated that although west bengal is culturally insulated against communal clashes, it was not out of danger. â€œthe heat of communal fire can be felt even in this state. there was an incident at canning. telenipara is still tense,â€� bhattacharjee admitted. the chief minister reiterated his governmentâ€™s resolve to take strong action against any attempt to vitiate communal harmony in this state. â€œthe government is alert. we will not allow any one to disturb amity,â€� he said. bhattacharjee also appealed to the people to remain cautious and snap any attempts to disturb peace. the left front will meet on april 11 to draw up a common programme and help the riot-affected people, said front chairman biman bose.

7,Night-long vigil by non-govt teachers,"kolkata: a large number of teachers in non-government colleges are not getting their salaries in time. in protest, seven executive committee members of the west bengal college and university teachers association (wbcuta) and several thousand teachers of non-government colleges have decided to organise a night-long sit-in demonstration in front of the left-controlled organisationâ€™s office on tuesday. state higher education minister satya sadhan chakraborty denied having received any complaint but admitted that payment of salaries could get delayed if the colleges failed to send the utilisation certificates of the previous instalments. â€œhow do i know if nobody tells me? as far as records in my office go, the salaries of all the colleges have been released,â€� chakraborty said. â€œmoreover, you must remember that many other state governments are not paying teachersâ€™ salaries at all. in our state, after all, we are not refusing them their salaries. and the law does not say that salaries have to be paid on the first day of the month,â€� he claimed. â€œwe received the salary for january and february on march 27,â€� said new alipore college commerce department head dipankar dasgupta. the teachers of the college are yet to receive their salaries for march. â€œit is good that the government has banned private tuition. but if we do not get our salaries in time, how can we run our families?â€� asked dasgupta. he could not buy books for his son this year. â€œi need rs 3,000 to buy new books my son. i donâ€™t know from where i will manage it,â€� he rued. the situation is the same in manindra chandra college. physics teacher pradeep ghosh said that he and his colleagues, too, got their salaries for january and february on march 27. â€œthose colleges which have their own resources can pay salaries in time. but in colleges like ours, that is not possible,â€� ghosh said. two months ago, in february, chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee was shocked to learn at a meeting that about 10,000 teachers of non-government colleges were not getting their salaries in time. â€œhow can such a thing happen?â€� an embarrassed chief minister, who was by then determined to do away with private tuition of college teachers, had asked the finance minister and the higher education minister, both of whom were present at the meeting. bhattacharjee then reportedly instructed his cabinet colleagues to ensure that the teachers got their salaries in time. two months down the line, the situation has only worsened. it appears that the wbcuta is divided on the issue as some of its senior leaders are said to be refusing to take up the matter with the state government.

9,Engg body flays govt,"kolkata: the engineering exports promotion council has severely criticised the west bengal government for the lack of industrial infrastructure in the state. eepc officials felt that the things would not get better unless the mindset of the workforce was changed. ""the way things are today, west bengal is at least 10-15 years behind the southern and western indian states,"" eepc eastern india chairman r.p sehgal said in kolkata on sunday after the annual eepc awards ceremony for excellence in exports in the eastern region. sehgal felt that the basic problem was the mindset of the workers. ""most of the workers here come from an agricultural background. whenever the harvest time comes, no amount of incentive will keep them back, despite the agricultural income being lower,"" he said. the infrastructure was the most pressing problem before the state''s industrial progress. ""west bengal touts itself as a power surplus state. but the quality of power is very poor. even if there is a strong wind, power is often shut off, and generators have to be kept ready all the time,"" sehgal said. almost 50 companies received awards under various categories. the awardees included major industries like tata steel, usha martin, hindusthan motors, along with smaller units like shammon engineering, supreme engineering and others. ""although the exports have not shown significant growth in recent times but if compounded annually there was an appreciable increase in exports in the past decade after the liberalisation of economy,"" union commerce secretary dipak chatterjee said. he exhorted the exporters to access products which other countries need and turn them into export based products to achieve a higher growth from its earlier rate of 0.6 per cent. expressing satisfaction over the improving export trends, he said the country could easily reach a target growth of 11 per cent if the trends continue. urging the states to improve the infrastructural facilities in the region, he said, ""only infrastructural development of the region would lead to overall development of economy and laudable increase in exports.""

10,466 candidates in fray for civic polls,"darbhanga: even as countdown to the civic body polls has already begun with candidates busy in hectic campaigning in their respective wards to woo the voters, the mood of the electorate seems to be quiet. the excitement and euphoria that precedes an electoral exercise is missing. ""certainly, we are least interested in the civic polls this time round as the previous elections yielded little to improve our lot,"" says shashi shekhar jha, a resident of ward number 6. atanu sinha, a bank employee who resides in rajkumar ganj locality of the same ward, makes a sarcastic remark, ""it is an exercise in futility. we are living in hellish conditions for the last 25 years here and no civic facilities worth the name have been provided to us. what''s the relevance of municipal elections then."" sanjay thakur, an eye surgeon, residing in kathalbari locality of ward number 7, comes out more forthrightly, ""lack of developmental activities on the part of civic body has belied all the aspirations of voters. although darbhanga was accorded the status of municipal corporation way back in 1982, the civic condition has deteriorated day by day."" meanwhile, as many as 466 candidates have remained in the fray for the elections of ward councilors in the 37 wards of the darbhanga municipalcorporation. the number of voters listed in the electoral roll of the corporation area is a little over 1.6 lakh. however, for the first time in the history of civic polls, a large number of female candidates are fighting the electoral battle of this kind after 12 wards were reserved for the women candidates according to the government''s reservation policy. an impressive number of 146 female candidates are in the fray. these include eight candidates, who have filed nominations from male bastions (unreserved wards). reservation of some wards for women led their male counterparts to take refuge in neighboring wards while some of the prospective candidates have fielded female kin in their fiefdom. the style of campaigning is quite similar to that witnessed during the previous elections with candidates parroting poll promises to improve civic condition if voted to represent their locality.

12,Curfew in Borsad after mob violence,"vadodara: violence erupted again in borsad town in anand district late sunday night. as many as 23 policemen were injured in stone-pelting, which continued till the wee hours of monday. stray incidents of arson continued in central gujarat, too. trouble began in borsad when a mob of about 1,500 persons came out to attack persons belonging to a particular community in rupakui and fatehpura areas at around 10.30 p.m. on sunday. acting on a tip-off, when the police rushed to the spot, some persons resorted to private firing. in the ensuing melee, at least 23 policemen, including borsad town police inspector and sub-inspector, were injured in stone-pelting. the police lobbed 15 teargas shells to tame the mob, but to no avail. then, the policemen fired 14 rounds from .303 rifles, dispersing the mob. no injuries were reported in the firing. despite the timely police action, the town simmered with tension. mobs started gathering once again in the same areas at 2 a.m. on monday. and this time, police sources said, the mobs were in larger numbers â€” about 2,000 to 2,500 persons. again, the police lobbed 17 teargas shells and opened fire to quell the mobs. in all, five rounds were fired from a revolver and 26 rounds from .303 rifles. but the mobs damaged two police vehicles. on the prevailing situation in the town, anand district superintendent of police b d waghela said curfew had been imposed and the situation was now under control.elsewhere, stray incidents of arson were reported. in villages around umreth, miscreants attempted to torch two kiosks and a roadside eatery.

13,UK ministers take acting lessons,"london: the royal academy of dramatic art (rada), britainâ€™s premier acting school, has been training government ministers in using theatrical techniques. they are understood to have been taught skills to ensure that their speeches and television interviews are delivered to the best effect. posture is studied so that it conveys suitable gravitas and vocal techniques are practised to reap â€œmaximum interest valueâ€� from scripts. clever use of breathing patterns is learnt so as to give time to think of a reply while being questioned. tutors at rada believe the skills of the stage can prove invaluable to those in government, where putting across the desired emotion and meaning are vital. lessons take place on a one-to-one basis amid great secrecy. last week rada refused to name any of the politicians it had trained, but confirmed: â€œrada tutors have worked up to the very highest level in government.â€� identifying which politicians bear the stamp of the theatre school that trained kenneth branagh and anthony hopkins will not be easy. last year parliament watchers noticed that robin cookâ€™s shrill voice had suddenly dropped an octave, giving him an added sense of confidence and authority. the shift followed merciless impressions of cook by rory bremner, the comedian. the leader of the house denied having had voice coaching, putting the change down to a bad cold. others who have shown an improvement in their commons performance include stephen byers, the transport secretary, who has lost some of his waspish demeanour, and alan milburn, the health secretary, who now conveys a confident image by projecting his voice more successfully than when he first entered parliament.

15,TRS demands package for Telangana farmers,"hyderabad: the telangana rashtra samithi (trs) has asked the government to announce a package for farmers who lost their crops in the recent gale and hailstorm in the telangana region on the lines of the one announced for the rayalaseema groundnut farmers. the telangana rashtra samithi has also demanded that the government pay an ex-gratia of rs 1 lakh each to the families of four persons who died in the hailstorm recently. the telangana rashtra samithi threatened to launch a massive agitation if the government did not concede its demand and take immediate measures to rescue the affected persons in the telangana region. speaking to reporters here on monday, telangana rashtra samithi president k chandrasekhar rao found fault with chief minister n chandrababu naidu for not visiting any of the hailstorm affected areas. it clearly showed the negligence of the chief minister towards farming community of the telangana region. â€œthe chief minister gave extensive publicity for cyclone in andhra region and picturised it as a national calamity. but the governmentâ€™s poor response to the hailstorm affected persons reflects its discrimination towards telangana,â€� he said and demanded that the government launch relief measures immediately as it had done in the andhra region during the cyclones. stating that the farmers in telangana suffered losses worth rs 125 crore during the recent hailstorm, rao said that despite this, the government did not stop collection of the power and water charges, besides recovering the loans from the affected farmers.

16,AMC to curb corruption in development projects,"ahmedabad: come may and the ahmedabad municipal corporation will set in motion an attempt to clean its civic projects of the notorious ''kickback syndrome''. in a move that could well hit the political wing of the civic body the hardest, the corporation has decided to award future civic projects only to those organisations which are nationally or even internationally reputed, preferably with an iso-9002 certification. with rs 100 crore (that the civic body recently got in its coffers by issuing non-convertible, tax-free debentures) in its disposal for civic projects, this change could well leave many ""interested"" parties of the amc sour. the logic behind this move is visible in plenty when one peruses the past records of the amc. records and pending inquiries with its vigilance department prove that kickbacks to certain sections of the civic body may have left many projects half-completed and thus defunct. the top-brass of the amc, now with the support from a certain section of its political bosses, has introduced this policy of converting most jobs into turn-key projects which would be handled only by the top professionals of the field. since the officials blame the unfinished business on lack of co-ordination between the five zonal offices of the amc, the municipal commissioner p panneervel recently formed a core committee of deputy municipal commissioners to ensure that there are no more repetitions of those tell-tale gaps between pipelines or pump-houses without the necessary pipeline network. if you are wondering about the type of ''wilful'' mistakes that may have spurred this change in the modus operandi of the amc, then here are a couple of examples: since more than a year now, the vatwa area has a pump-house that does not have a pipeline network to pump out filth from the area. meanwhile at ishanpur, the opposite is true: this area has a pipeline network waiting for more than a year for a pump house, which is yet to be constructed. another example of similar irregularities also can be gauged from the fact that the amc has scaled down project cost for undoing the wrong done. the civic body now proposes to complete similar unfinished business (like at ishanpur and vatwa) at a cost of rs 12 crore. the earlier estimate submitted by the authorities of amc for the same job was rs 17.5 crore. careful scrutiny of the nature of the job (read misdeed) allowed this scale-down. panneervel told tnn: ""a priority-list of projects has been prepared by my team of dymcs. and, riots notwithstanding, i have already ensured that wherever possible we have restarted work on such unfinished projects. once work in this area is complete, which i expect to be over by another four months, we will have finally put resources worth crores of rupees to good use."" another hefty section (rs 42 crore) of the debenture money, has been set aside for water supply, sewage and stormwater drainage pipeline projects which would largely benefit residents of the eastern sector of ahmedabad. here too, credentials and track record would help decide on prospective contractors. a source informed: ""this has been done to correct the mistakes committed in the past. possibilities of kickbacks too will be reduced to zero as only companies with established credentials will get the job."" even the rs 40-crore plan to construct 10 flyovers to ease traffic congestion on the city''s thoroughfares will be given to only those organisations with iso-9002 certification. panneervel, however, reasons, ""our motive behind short-listing on those prospective civil-engineering firms with iso-9002 certification is to ensure that ahmedabad gets the best. a three-part bidding process has also been designed to ensure quality. ""like in the flyover project, we will first peruse the designs then go through the technical aspects suggested by each bidder and lastly if it addresses the necessities of each locality that will have a flyover within a year''s time. i hope to begin work on this by may."" he added, ""for example, we want the professional firms (that are being contracted for building the 10 flyovers in city) to give us indigenously developed designs that would have a long life-span, be aesthetically perfect, suit the needs of that particular locality and be economical too. the other aspect that we are looking at is the completion of all the projects within a year.""

17,PMO minister meets CM,"hyderabad: minister of state in the prime minister's office vijay goel had a one-on-one discussion with chief minister chandrababu naidu at the secretariat in hyderabad on monday. even though goel described the meeting as a courtesy call'', many issues like gujarat, ayodhya, and the relations between the tdp and bjp reportedly figured in the talks. goel later told reporters that like other parties, the tdp too was worried about the situation in gujarat. goel said the gujarat chief minister narendra modi's exit was not a solution to the problem and called upon parties not to politicise the issue. replying to searching questions from reporters, goel said he had come called on naidu as a matter of courtesy as he was in the city in connection with an unrelated meeting. we discussed good governance,'' he said. asked about the bad governance'' in gujarat, he said naidu wanted the rehabilitation of victims and the law and order situation to be handled effectively. goel told naidu about the package of relief measures announced by the prime minister, which he said had infused some confidence among the people and the situation was improving. replying to a question about the hitch in the food for work programme at the centre, he said that 1.75 lakh tonnes of rice had already been sanctioned for andhra pradesh and more would be released soon. the minister said the issue of the telugu desam party's nominee for the post of lok sabha speaker did not figure in his talks with the chief minister.

18,Scribes lead protests as Modi orders transfers,"ahmedabad: mediapersons from different publications and news channels demonstrated at the income-tax circle on monday against the incidents at the sabarmati ashram even as gujarat chief minister transferred or suspended those police officers responsible on sunday in what is being described as a surprisingly â€˜â€˜swiftâ€™â€™ action. the transfers of additional commissioner of police shivanand jha, deputy commissioner of police v m parghi and the suspension of police inspector of sabarmati police station prakash mehra is considered prompt in view of the fact that the journalists who bore the brunt of the attack was from a news channel that has been facing the ire of the modi regime. ahmedabad additional commissioner had even banned relay of this channel during the riots. besides the transfers, a special inquiry commission, headed by justice s d dave, a retired high court judge will be set up to probe the incident. the commission will submit its report in three weeks and punitive measures will be taken against those found guilty on the basis of this report. the violence at the gandhi ashram was sparked off due to protests over the presence of activist medha patkar, but instead of controlling the mob, the police attacked the media without any provocation. meanwhile, a section of the police is interpreting the transfer of senior ips officer jha as a move long-awaited that got provoked with the attack on mediapersons. sources say that apart from from new delhi where the bjp had a lot of explaining to do to its nda partners, there were many local bjp leaders who had scores to settle with these officers, especially jha. the sources said that in the meeting held by the chief minister on sunday, the authorities wanted to suspend deputy commissioner of police v m parghi, but it was director general of police k chakravarthi and police commissioner p c pande who reportedly got the penalty scaled down to a transfer on a compromise that jha too would go with parghi. jha has been in the line of the bjp fire for a long time and the recent communal riots only reaffirmed their commitment to take action.

22,'Dhumal govt dividing HP into segments',"dharamsala: the former chief minister and the congress legislative party leader,virbhadra singh alleged here on tuesday that the dhumal government was indulging in division of the hilly state into small segments on the basis of caste, religion and area. addressing a rally at sulah about 25 kilometres from here, singh said that alleged division of the people of the state by the dhumal government in order to consolidate its vote-bank was unethical. he said that even the state bureaucracy had not been spared in terms of creating wedge within it to promote its political interests. speaking about the development in the state, he said that the focus of the state government was only on the development of hamirpur district, which is the home district of the chief minister prem kumar dhumal. he said that excluding hamirpur almost all the areas of state and especially kangra had been totally neglected in regard to development. singh asserted that the state administration was neck-deep in corruption and testimony to this fact was the questionable selection of the candidates by the state subordinate services selection board and state public service commission for various posts being filled since the dhumal government took charge of the state four years back. he accused that the state services selection board and the state public service commission had recruited even those candidates who did not even appear in the screening test held for the particular post. continuing his attack on the state government, he said that bjp did not get the mandate to govern during the last assembly elections held four years back in 1998, but due to the hvcs support it managed to form the government.

23,160 left in fray for Shimla civic polls,"shimla: with the rejection of four nomination papers, 160 candidates were left in the fray for the municipal corporation elections slated for april 27. the candidature of ashok sood (cong) has also been challenged from ward no 13, on which a decision is likely to be taken on wednesday by the assistant returning officer (aro). official sources said that the papers of rajesh and shyam lal both from ward no 7 had been rejected on the grounds that they had filled the forms as official candidates of the bjp, but did not have the party authorisation letter. the nomination papers of rakesh kumar were rejected from ward no 12 because his name did not figure in the electoral roll, while that of shiv kumar was rejected from ward no 14, as there was no scheduled caste certificate attached with the nomination papers. but it is the case of ashok sood that has become a bone of contention, with congressmen alleging foul play on part of the concerned authorities. district congress committee vice president arun sharma said that the papers of ashok sood had been found correct in the morning when the aro was scrutinising them and even invited objections, but no objections were filed, whereafter the candidature was declared valid and the scrutiny of papers for ward no 14 and 15 were taken up successively. sharma alleged that after the scrutiny was over, the deputy commissioner reportedly allowed the scrutiny of ashok soodâ€™s nomination papers, which was against rules.thereafter at 5:30 p m, staff of the deputy commissionerâ€™s office came with summons that ashok sood reach the office by 6 p m and file his version, he added. he said that the staff was told that ashok sood had gone for canvassing and could not receive the summons nor reach the d câ€™s office by the stipulated time at which, the staff pasted the summon and left. â€˜â€˜this is against all norms of democracy and election practice,â€� he added. the dcc vice president said that the objection was that ashok sood has an office of the vyopar mandal shimla on lease which owes a hefty amount as rent to the corporation. â€˜â€˜the fact is that the office is leased in the name of the mandal general secretary, arun kuthiala and there are no dues against ashok sood, but if the deputy commissioner in his capacity as returning officer rejects the nomination papers, the dcc will sit on a dharna,â€� he added.
