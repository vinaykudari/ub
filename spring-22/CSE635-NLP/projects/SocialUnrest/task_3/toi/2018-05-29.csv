0,India rules out referendum in Kashmir,"new delhi: india has dismissed pervez musharraf's reported desire to meet hurriyat leaders on his delhi visit as something ""beyond comprehension"". and in case pakistan wants to talk about a referendum in jammu and kashmir, it has ruled that out. setting what could be interpreted as india's bottomline on the kashmir issue, external affairs minister jaswant singh said that there was no question of delhi agreeing to a referendum in the state to determine its future. and he also recalled a parliament resolution stating that jammu and kashmir was an integral part of india. ""that remains unaltered,"" singh said when faced with questions on india's stand during the proposed talks. also stated was india's opposition to ""denominational nationalism"", an apparent reference to pakistan's claim that jammu and kashmir belonged to it because it was a muslim-majority state. ""we believe in civic nationalism,"" he said. he, however, added that india did not wish to enter into 'contentious' issues before musharraf arrived. at his press conference, singh went through a balancing act. he didn't want to say anything which had the potential of derailing the talks even before they began. but faced with specific questions, he had to state delhi's stand. like reiterating that maintaining law and order in the valley was india's internal affair. initially singh parried questions on pakistan foreign minister abdul sattar's reported remark that musharraf planned to meet hurriyat leaders in delhi. ""that's a non-issue,"" he said. asked later to elaborate, he said, ""a non-issue is a non-issue."" pressed further if that meant that delhi would not create obstacles in a hurriyat-musharraf meeting, singh said that the prime minister's invitation was meant for musharraf's meeting with him. ""from where all the additionalities have come in is beyond my comprehension,"" he said. in the past, india has consistently rejected the idea of a tripartite delhi-hurriyat-islamabad talks on kashmir. and even during the six-month ceasefire, it made clear that it was not keen on the hardliners in the hurriyat conference visiting pakistan. singh reiterated india's position that militancy in jammu and kashmir had been 'encouraged' and 'abetted' by pakistan. that was a fact of life, he said. but he justified what critics have termed an about-turn in india's policy that there would be no talks with pakistan till it gave up cross-border terrorism. india had said that it would not talk unless there was a 'conducive atmosphere' for resumption of negotiations, he reminded. he insisted there had been a change in attitude on the other side of the line of control. he added that there had been ""a very significant and very substantial"" decline in the exchange of fire between the two countries at the loc. india is also willing to bury the ghosts of kargil. ""we believe that we have to move beyond the confines of history,"" he said. unless the two countries addressed the challenges of tomorrow, they would do great harm to their people, he added. he further said that india's policy towards pakistan was not 'absolutist'. the invitation to musharraf was sent out at the right time, singh insisted. ""the timing should be right. that is decided by the government,"" he said. singh also indicated a revival of the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc) process, possibly leading up to the summit-meet, which has been postponed since 1999. the two foreign secretaries will meet on the sidelines of a coming saarc officials-level meeting. while making clear that india was willing to do business with a general, the minister made clear that it was not condoning the military takeover. he said that the fact remained that there was change of government in pakistan through military coup. time had passed since then and there also had been some opening up to the democratic process. ""we have to deal with the government of the day. and it is our decision to deal with them,"" he said. answering another question on india's stand against pakistan being in the commonwealth as a military dictator had taken power, singh said that the organisation had its own yardsticks. but india was against a change of government through military means.

2,Mamata at political cross-roads,"kolkata: after her party's electoral debacle in west bengal, trinamul congress supremo mamata banerjee is at the political cross-roads again. congress, her current electoral ally in west bengal is giving the cold shoulder. her former allies, bjp leaders in west bengal, are trying to drive a wedge in the trinamul by cosying up to rebel trinamul leader ajit panja. and trinamul's former state president is busy constituting a new state executive committee and split the trinamul. is there a way out for mamata to wriggle out of the situation? as a first step to political manoeuvring after the assembly elections, a group of trinamul mps and mlas are leaving for delhi on monday and tuesday ostensibly to meet president k.r. narayanan and hand him over a list of complaints regarding electoral malpractices that allegedly took place during the elections. an effort will also be made to meet prime minister atal behari vajpayee. but not everyone in trinamul are sure this will be the right move to make. ""we really do not know why we are going to delhi,"" said an mla. according to trinamul sources, the ""five to six page"" draft will cite several instances of ""gross irregularities"". the party has identified nearly 80 booths where voting was rigged. the letter to the president will also point out cases where voting was completed ""early"" and also instances where people were led out of the booths after their fingers were marked with the indelible ink on the ground that they need not take the trouble of operating the electronic voting machine. moreover, the administration is yet to bring out the boothwise voting figures and has given only constituencywise figures. though figures for 66,000 booths are expected shortly, trinamul insiders feel that the adminsitration is taking far too long to compile these. mamata's delhi sojourn, however, has given rise to intense speculation in kolkata's political circles. a section of trinamul leaders close to mamata feel that she is trying desperately to rebuild bridges with the nda despite party spokesman sudip bandyopadhyay categorically ruling out such a possibility. a section of the newly-elected trinamul mlas feel that it would be suicidal for mamata to rejoin the nda. a compromise solution would be, like the telugu desam party, to support the nda from outside, pointed out the mla. trinamul is yet to formally sever ties with the nda. as party spokesman sudip bandyopadhyay recently said, ""the letter to this effect can be sent before the lok sabha reconvenes."" by keeping the option to join back the nda open, mamata will be able to keep her flock together, especially in the face of rebel mp ajit panja's persistent attack on the ""coterie"" around mamata. in fact, it was ajit panja who kept up the line that the trinamul had made a blunder by dumping the nda. a section of trinamul leaders point out that bjp leader tapan sikdar's recent remark on panja being offered a ministerial berth is aimed at driving a wedge in the trinamul leadership and that one of the reasons behind mamata's delhi visit is to isolate ajit panja by trying to be close to the nda. trinamul insiders feel that the way out for mamata is also the most difficult one to tread. ""mamata should stick to her call of going it alone,"" said a trinamul mla close to mamata.

3,"BJP, Samata to stay out of Manipur govt","new delhi: in a clearly uncomfortable compromise, the bjp and samata party on monday decided to stay outside the process of government formation in manipur, which could now be headed for central rule. in a terse statement after a meeting of state and central leaders of both parties at the bjp headquarters here, bjp president jana krishnamurthi said that legislators of the two parties would neither stake claim in manipur nor support any formation. the parties also issued a joint statement to the effect, signed by leaders present at the meeting, including ousted samata party chief minister radhabinod koijam and bjp state legislature party chief r.k. dorendra singh, who had staked claim to form government. both leaders were also present at the press conference after the meeting, but did not speak. other leaders who signed the statement were krishnamurthy, samata party president v.v. krishna rao, president of the samata party manipur unit o lohrii, manipur bjp chief m. bharat singh and samata party spokesman shambhu srivastava. asked how many mlas the bjp had now, krishnamurthi refused to answer, saying ""wait and watch"". padmanabha acharya, bjp in-charge of the north-east, however, later admitted that the party had 26 mlas, but could be left with about six after the day's developments. krishnamurthi was also evasive when asked whether president's rule would be imposed in manipur saying ""that is for you to infer. i can only say that the bjp with all its mlas and samata party mlas will remain outside the process of government formation."" shambhu srivastava said that the two parties were writing to the manipur governor informing him of the decision. he, too, avoided a direct answer to whether president's rule would be sought saying it was now upto the governor to assess the situation and send in a recommendation to the centre. but he added that with more than 40 mlas of a house of 60 remaining out of any process of government formation, there did not seem many options. the bjp has 26 mlas in the five-party progressive democratic alliance (pda). a split in the party in manipur could enable the next largest constituent of the pda, the manipur state congress party (chaoba) to form government. the mscp(c) on monday asked manipur governor ved marwah to allow it to lead a pda government under speaker sapam dhananjoy singh if the bjp was unwilling to do so. dhanajoy singh has claimed to have the support of all 41 mlas. the manipur crisis was precipitated by the voting out on may 21 of the samata party-led radhabinod koijam government, with bjp mlas joining the opposition in the no-confidence vote. forty-one mlas had on sunday sworn allegiance to the pda led by rebel bjp leader dorendra singh, who had staked claim to form government. monday's meeting was being seen as crucial with the manipur crisis threatening to spill over to the centre. a withdrawal of support by the samata party to the nda government would have reduced the government's majority to a slender seven. after mamata banerjee's trinamul congress withdrew support, the government has a majority of just 19 in the lok sabha.

7,Mine workers protest sacking,"bellary: the standoff between the management and employees of vibhuthigudda mines and bellary iron ore private ltd (biop) continued with the latter threatening to stop all mining activity in the region. the management, however, defended the retrenchment of 54 `piece-rated' employees, saying it had `no other alternative'. s.k. modi, the director of vibhuthigudda mines and biop, said the mmtc, which was the major buyer of ore, had restricted itself to 70 per cent. it had last year restricted it to 80 per cent. the mmtc also stopped the procurement of manually broken lumpy ore __ basic or super __ from may 1 this year. while denying that retrenchment was made due to the switching over from manual to latest technology, he said the decision was a result of lack of demand for manually broken lumpy ore. countries like japan and south korea have stopped procuring such ore, he added. modi said retrenchments were made as per the norms laid down under section 25 (f) of the industrial disputes act. as per the rules in the mining industry, workers were paid benefits such as retrenchment compensation, gratuity and bonus based on their length of service. modi said the management also agreed to consider further payments within the framework of rules concerned. besides, these workers are covered under the provident fund and have accumulated amounts ranging from rs 25,000 to rs 60,000. he lamented that the two rounds of discussion the management had with the ganikarmikara sangha president k. somasekhar yielded no result. he appealed to somasekhar to come forward for further discussions, saying, ``the doors are still not closed.''

8,Girl commits suicide after failing in Board exams,"new delhi: a 17-year-old class xii student committed suicide in her delhi cantonment residence after she failed to clear her boards examination. in a similar incident in mandawli, east delhi, another girl tried to commit suicide by consuming poison. shalini, a science student of kendriya vidyalaya no 1, delhi cantonment, ended her life at about 11.50 a.m. on monday by reportedly shooting herself in the head with her father's licensed gun. she left behind a short suicide note, written on a page torn from her school diary, stating: ``i am doing it with my own wish''. minutes before taking the drastic step shalini had phoned her father, lance naik g s rathore who is posted with an artillery brigade, at his office and told him that she was going to her school to check the results ``it appears that someone informed shalini about the result over the phone because she never went to the school,'' said a police officer. a few minutes later when her mother stepped out of the house, shalini loaded her father's gun and shot herself. her 14-year-old brother, moni singh, who was in the adjacent room rushed in to find his sister in a pool of blood on the floor. the 12 bore bullet had practically ripped away part of the victim's head. there was blood all over the small room. within minutes of the incident, neighbours took shalini to the hospital but the exercise proved futile. police officials believe that failure in the board exams may not have been the only reason for shalini to commit suicide. ``the girl was suffering from cerebral tuberculosis. as a result she used to suffer from fits and often lost consciousness. for several months she had been battling the ailment,'' said a police officer. by afternoon, the rathore's two-room house at sanyat lines was full of neighbours. the victim's mother was delirious. no one wanted to talk about the tragic incident. in another incident of result-related trauma, a class xii student of mayur vihar public school was hospitalised after she consumed a pesticide in her house in mandawli. kaushal, 17, a resident of west vinod nagar, consumed the pesticide soon after returning from her school where she had reportedly gone to check her result. kaushal, a science student, had reportedly failed in the exam. ``the girl locked herself in the bathroom and consumed the poison. she was rushed to a private hospital by her family where she was stated to be out of danger,'' the police said.

9,Wah India case: Who are these lawyers?,"new delhi: when it was the press, it was hauled over the coals for contempt, but there was not even a word when it came to disclosing the names of the lawyers who participated in the survey - allegedly aimed at lowering the image of judges in the eyes of the common man. an application filed by advocate b l wadehra, seeking direction to the magazine editor to disclose the names of these lawyers and other from wah india, was disposed of without any specific direction. curiously enough, the judges too at one place in their ruling observed ``as to who the so-called senior lawyers are, have not been indicated (by the respondents or the petitioners in their pleadings) and how they have been described as `senior lawyers' is shrouded in mystery''.

11,Govt drags feet on changing farmland succession law,"new delhi: a public interest litigation challenging the male lineal succession in the 50-year-old delhi land reforms act is awaiting the delhi government's response for over a year. the committee constituted following a pil in the delhi high court is yet to file its reply regarding proposed amendments in the act. under this outdated law, a widow or daughter cannot inherit farmland if there is a male successor in the family. advocate j m kalia, who filed the petition in april last year, said: ``the government seems to have forgotten the role of the committee. they had announced it with much fanfare. but when the time came to submit a reply in court, the government started asking for time.'' another advocate jagdev, who is trying to get relief for three sisters after their father's death, says: ``these girls are fighting a losing battle. their father was a shareholder of two acres of his ancestral property. after his death, the land went to his brothers. this happened because the three daughters are married and do not have any brother to inherit the land.'' jagdev claims the government is sitting over the issue. ``it is not difficult for the government to amend the act. it is a state legislation and if the delhi government wants changes, they can be made as soon as possible,'' kalia contends. the petition was filed in april 2000 by a law student, tony jacob. the pil states that section 50 of the act is discriminatory and prefers male descendants to female. ``this provision of the act violates the right to life, guaranteed under article 21 of the constitution. right to livelihood is an integral facet of the right to life. by virtue of this section the legal heir of the deceased male descendants, including widow and minor children, are denied the right to livelihood,'' the pil read.

13,CM meets farmer representatives,"lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh held an open discussion with about 500 farmer representatives from 70 districts of the state regarding their interest under world trade organisation and gatt here on monday. he assured the representatives that the central and state governments were committed to safeguarding their interests. he said the difficulty before the central government was that those international agreements accepted by the then government in 1994 could not be revoked by the nda government in a single stroke. however, the government was taking decisions in the larger interest of the farmers and was even raising its voice at international level from time to time. referring to lifting of quantitative restrictions on imports under gatt, the chief minister said the congress party itself had accepted the gatt agreement, but now the same party was spreading misconceptions among the farmers that lifting of quantitative restrictions would increase import of oil seeds, resulting in loss to the oil seed farmers.
