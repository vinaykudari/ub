Suhrawardy said the petitioners had to be detained till the case against them was decided by a competent court.

1,"Sops for Punjab govt employees, farmers","CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has given sops to government employees and farmers. For employees, there is another instalment of dearness allowance (DA) and farmers have been exempted from sales tax on pesticides and weedicides.

Announcing this here at a press conference on Wednesday, chief minister Amarinder Singh said the government has decided to release another instalment of DA at the rate of three per cent to its employees and pensioners. With this raise, they would be be at parity with the union government employees and would be getting the highest DA in the country. Now they would get DA of 55 per cent instead of 52 per cent, while most of the state government employees get only 40 to 45 per cent DA.

The arrears of DA from January to April 2003 would be deposited in the provident fund and employees would get the enhanced DA in cash from May onwards.

The total burden from this would be in the vicinity of Rs 103.38 crore, which includes 10.02 crore for the enhanced DA of aided institutions.

On the other hand, the farmers would be benefited to the tune of Rs 40 crore by the government decision to exempt all pesticides and weedicides from sales tax. The tax rate has been brought down from four percent to zero percent, added Amarinder.

Earlier, he held a long meeting with the agitating farmersâ€™ outfits, where he sympathetically listened to their demands. Conceding that most of their demands were justified, Amarinder said that he was with them on the issue of defreezing of minimum support price (MSP) and non-lifting of Punjab sugar from cooperative mills.

â€˜â€˜I have myself raised these issues at the National Development Council meetings and other fora that the MSP for wheat and paddy canâ€™t be freezed when prices of agricultural inputs have been rising,â€™â€™ Amarinder said. But on farmersâ€™ demands like freeze on power tariff for farm sector, he said there were financial constraints.

Dismissing speculation on his meeting with Andhra Pradesh governor and senior Akali leader Surjit Singh Barnala, Amarinder said it was just a â€˜â€˜courtesy callâ€™â€™. He clarified that the government wonâ€™t issue any white paper on the Punjab State Electricity Board but would provide all information sought by the parties concerned.

2,"A man with a mission, but no government","NEW DELHI: What does a diplomat with a mission but no government to represent do? A tough question, but the charge d''affaires at the Iraqi embassy here has an answer. ""I am representing my people, my country,"" Adday Al Sakab maintains, stoically dismissing any suggestion that his role as an envoy has ended with the ouster of the Saddam Hussein regime by the US.

In fact, the buzz in the Iraqi embassy would appear to bear out his argument. Though the embassy no longer sports any portraits of Saddam - they once were mounted in every room - it would seem like business as usual were it not for an air of watchful tension.

Sakab is busy answering phones, dealing with queries by businessmen and says he is too occupied to meet anyone without an appointment.

Irritated with ""false reports"" suggesting the embassy had closed down or that he was seeking asylum, he maintains that he has been carrying out his diplomatic activities to the best of his capacity.

In fact, in one of his first diplomatic engagements in the post-Saddam era, Sakab says he was called in to South Block to discuss the issue of delivery of relief assistance from India to Iraq.

However, he admits that in the absence of any authority, his role is limited. He has had no contact with Baghdad and currently limits himself to ""waiting and watching, sitting here waiting for directions"".

His colleague, Omar Munir, a third secretary in the embassy, wants to go home. This is his first posting and he has been here a bare six months, not exactly the smoothest of first innings in the diplomatic service. But he is not in a tearing hurry to return. His immediate family is with him in Delhi and he has heard from Baghdad that all his other family members there are safe. The families of all other embassy staffers are also safe.

Munir and his colleagues say Indians have been very kind. ""My neighbours ask about our families (in Iraq) and say they are praying for us.""

Munir sees no reason why he will not continue to represent whatever authority is set up in Baghdad.

Iraqi refugees sitting in the embassy are, however, more outspoken than the staffers. Hassan Alsary had to leave Iraq because he was a political activist and does not think he can return for a year or two. ""That is how long it will take for the Americans to leave Iraq.""

3,French minister's visit to boost defence ties,"NEW DELHI: French Defence Minister Michele Alliot Marie will in Delhi later this week to discuss ways to boost defence cooperation with India, including finalisation of deals like the one for the ""Scorpene"" submarines which are to be constructed at the Mazagaon Docks in Mumbai.

With the IAF looking for 130 multi-role fighter jets to bolster its ageing fleet due to the delay in the induction of the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), France is also keen to sell its Mirage-2000V jets to India.

Marie, who will lead a high-level military and armament industry delegation, is scheduled to hold talks with defence minister George Fernandes on April 28. She will also meet the three Service chiefs, Admiral Madhvendra Singh, Air Chief Marshal S Krishnaswamy and General N C Vij.

The French minister is likely to press for the early finalisation of the $ 1.8-billion deal for the construction in India of six ""Scorpene"" killer submarines, said to be a generation ahead of the Pakistan-acquired ""Agosta"" submarines. The deal has been cleared by the defence ministry and is awaiting the final approval from the Cabinet Committee on Security.

Already collaborating with India in matters like upgradation of radars and modernisation of military helicopters, France has become one of the largest military hardware and software suppliers to India.

4,MPs' panel pulls up govt over defence purchases,"NEW DELHI: Though Army troops battling heavily-armed militants in Jammu and Kashmir are facing a crippling shortage of bullet-proof jackets, the government seems to be merely sitting on the decision to procure them.

This when over 1,000 soldiers have died in counter-insurgency operations in the last three years.

The parliamentary standing committee on defence has expressed its ""deep concern and alarm"" that only 1.24 lakh bullet-proof jackets are available when 3.53 lakh jackets are required for troops operating in anti-terrorist duties and along the Line of Control in J&K.

""It is disturbing to note that such a huge shortage still remains notwithstanding the fact that the procurement action was initiated as far back as 1988-89,"" said the committee.

The defence ministry told the committee that 1,24,640 bullet-proof jackets have been purchased for the Army through imports and indigenous production. Though the imported jackets are lighter, weighing 4.5 kg, to the indigenous ones at 5.5 kg, they cost almost double than those produced domestically.

""The required number of bullet-proof jackets of a quality in conformity with international standards must be procured either from Indian or international sources in a time-bound manner,"" said the committee.

5,Amendment to plug loophole in anti-defection law,"NEW DELHI: The days of jumbo ministries and large-scale defections may soon be over. A Constitutional amendment, approved by the Union cabinet on Wednesday evening, will put an end to defections in the garb of a split in a legislature party.

The amendment to the Constitution''s 10th Schedule takes away para 3 of the anti-defection law which recognised a ""split"" if the legislators, defying the party whip, form a third of the total strength of a legislature party.

Cabinet spokesperson Sushma Swaraj announced that a Bill would be brought before Parliament in the current session. She termed the proposed change as ""far-reaching and important"".

The anti-defection law was enacted in the wake of the massive majority that was won by the late Rajiv Gandhi government on the argument that it would end defections. Critics of the law, among them the late deputy prime minister Devi Lal, had held that it had been enacted in haste and that it was allowing manipulations among party leaders.

Another important decision pertained to delimitation of Lok Sabha seats under the 2001 census data that would allow for an increase of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It replaced an earlier decision to go by the 1991 census figures. The update means that there would be 15 more seats, instead of eight, for SCs and STs.

In yet another decision, the law would limit the size of ministries at the Centre and in states to no more than 10 per cent of the total strength, whether a legislature has one House or two (unicameral or bicameral Houses). For the smaller legislatures, the maximum number has been fixed at seven ministers.

6,"Munna takes potshots at pardafaash, cycle rally","Lucknow: Taking a potshot at recent â€œamusing anticsâ€� of the opposition parties, UPCC president Arun Kumar Singh Munna said that the cycle rally or the pardafaash drama would not help harassed masses.

What the common man in UP wanted was supply of drinking water and electricity and the hollow political antics to draw attention alone refused to touch him, Munna said while addressing mediapersons on Wednesday.

The bleak electricity scene might play havoc with farmers as this happened to be the threshing season, he said. Munna also expressed reservations about the wheat procurement policy adopted by the government and said that it might fail the same way as in the case of potato or paddy.

Slamming the chief minister for throwing all norms to winds in her blind pursuit of political vendetta, Munna apportioned larger share of blame to her coalition partner the BJP. â€œSaare gunahon ke mool mein sirf BJP hai,â€� said the UPCC president.

Despite Mayawatiâ€™s track record of opportunistic style of â€œuse and dumpâ€� politics, the saffron party, he said, continued to have ties with her for its present and future gains. However, she might belie their expectation during the parliamentary polls, he remarked.

The UPCC president said the Congress has launched a concerted drive to strengthen its infrastructural network.

Besides the meeting of district and divisional Congress presidents and state Congress party functionaries slated for Thursday, there would be various other meetings at the district and division level from May 1 to June 15. In July, the party would begin its cadre training programme, he said.

7,Penury forces six to suicide,"KANPUR: Poverty, burgeoning debt and reported threats by a policeman drove an ex-armyman and his family of five to commit suicide in the city on Wednesday.

The incident happened at Sanjay Gandhi Nagar, near the Kath-ka-Pul in Naubasta when one Ram Vilas Pal, lone breadwinner for his family, mixed â€˜sulphasâ€™ in sweets and consumed it along with his wife, Rani, his three daughters â€”Seema (22), Sonu (20), Renu (18) and their lone son, 15-year-old Sunil.

The tragic incident came to light in the morning when their landlord Ram Sanjivan Chauhan knocked at their room. When he got no response, he entered the room only to find all the six lying dead on cots. A crumpled, hand-written suicide note was also recovered from the hands of Pal. The note detailed the pitiable condition of the the family which forced them to commit suicide. The family was living in poverty ever since Pal took voluntary retirement from the army a few years back but was denied pension since some papers were incomplete.

Pal had taken voluntary retirement from the Swadeshi Cotton Mills three years back where he was working as a security guard. Thereafter he had taken a loan from an acquaintance â€” a police constable, Kamlesh Dubey, which he could not repay. Dubey allegedly threatened Pal with dire consequences.

Talking to TNN, SSP MK Bashal said that the police was probing this angle also and had done preliminary questioning of the wife of the constable since Dubey himself is away on 30-day leave.

8,Steps to check tax losses to govt,"RAJAHMUNDRY: Steps will be taken to recover the tax lost, if any, to the government during purchase transactions made by Transco and Genco, energy minister Kothapalli Subbarayudu said on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters, the minister said Transco and Genco officials who failed to deduct the tax at source while making payments for purchases would be punished.

Asked about the reported probe by the vigilance department into illegal rebates given to suppliers by these corporations, the minister said: â€œThe responsibility will be fixed and action taken against those responsible.â€™â€™

Subbarayudu said that while 24 hours of regular power supply was being maintained in the towns, there was an eight-hour power cut in villages.

However, steps are being taken by the government to add 3,550 mw of power in the next two years.

He said the state has added about 4,000 mw of power generation in the last four years and there was still a supply gap.

The minister said the government had recently approved three power projects to be executed by Genco and four in the private sector to improve the situation in the next two years.

9,TDP workers clash in different parts of state,"HYDERABAD: For the second day, Telugu Desam Party witnessed group clashes at different places in the state during the party elections on Wednesday. The TDP is conducting elections to the party mandal-level committees.

Though Chandrababu Naidu suspended ten party workers for indulging in violence and disrupting the election process on Wednesday, it apparently did not deter the cadre from continuing the infighting.

11,Laloo's 'samdhini' to lead men with lathis to rally,"DANAPUR: Jamaluddinchak in Khagaul, which is the â€˜samdhianaâ€™ of RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav â€” or Sasural of his eldest daughter Misa Bharti â€” is all agog with excitement and upbeat mood for the RJD Maharaila to be held in Gandhi Maidan here on April 30.

Thousands of RJD workers are likely to take part in it with lathis in their hands. According to Lalooâ€™s Samdhi Ram Babu Patheek, his wife Urmila Patheek will lead a band of 1,000 RJD supporters, including women from Khagaul alone, to participate in the Maharaila. However, about 2,000 RJD supporters will join the Maharailla with lathis in their hands from Patheekâ€™s native village Kunjwan in Bihta.

Both RJD chief and chief minister Rabri Devi personally visited it on April 10 to invite its people to attend the Maharaila in large numbers, he said. Patheek said his son Shailesh and daughter-in-law Misa will not be able to take part in the Maharaila since they were away in Banglore these days. He added that he had given his full moral support to the Maharaila. At the Danapur contonment, RJD leaders are moving from place to place to garner support for the April 30 mega show.

According to a local RJD leader Udai Rai, about 4,000 to 5,000 lathi wielding people will take part in the rally from the Danapur area only. Meanwhile, the railways are much worried about the forthcoming Maharaila, since those participating in it are likely to put bona fide passengers to a great inconvenience. The railway sources said a special drive will be launched for two days from April 29 to April 30 to prevent unauthorised entry into all long-distance trains.

12,Transco asks govt to bail it out,"HYDERABAD: The cash strapped Transmission Corporation of AP Limited (AP Transco) has sought an urgent release of Rs 500 crore from the state government to help it tide over a severe financial crisis and to prevent an impending cutting off of power supplies from the central sector power stations to the state.

In a submission to the chief minister, Transco said there was a real danger of it losing up to 1,000 mega watts of power that the state receives from central sector power stations if their dues are not paid on time. Highlighting the dire state of its finances, Transco said, â€œIf this situation continues beyond April, Transco will start defaulting on central power stations payments and will lose its share of 1,000 mega watts.â€�

But sources in the government said that though Transco has asked for Rs 500 crore, the government may not be in a position to release the entire amount. Instead, the government is expected to release about Rs 135 to Rs 150 crore to help Transco tide over the immediate payment crisis. The money, though not as much as asked by Transco, would be released in the next few days, according to sources in the energy department. Transco had earlier listed Rs 1,232 crore as receivables from the government under various heads of account.

According to the sources, the partial cash bailout for Transco is expected to be a part of the state governmentâ€™s promised subsidy to Transco, totalling Rs 1509.38 crore.

If Transco slips on payments to the central sector power stations, then the stoppage in power supply would result in a large gap between demand and supply and worsen the crisis already facing the state on the supply front.

This month, average shortfall in supply has been 4.3 million units with the availability hovering around 131 million units and the requirement around 136 million units.

14,'Hindu alliance' to be formed to fight next polls: Singhal,"BANGALORE: Asserting that the secularism would be ""uprooted"" from the country, VHP International Working President Ashok Singhal on Thursday said a ""Hindu alliance"" of parties would be formed to fight the next general elections.

""It will be a Hindu conglomeration in the next elections. It will not be NDA. It will be a Hindu alliance. It will be formed. We do not know how it will be formed,"" Singhal told reporters here.

""It will get two thirds majority,"" he said but declined to specify who the constituents of the so called ""Hindu alliance"" would be.

Describing the NDA as a ""conglomeration of secularists and BJP,"" he said, he did not know ""what BJP is today. It came to power because of Hindutva. Advani rode the rath and I do not know how he is trying to balance between Hindutva and secularism.""

Singhal, who was replying to questions on the Ayodhya movement, said government should bring in a legislation to pave the way for construction of Ram Temple as courts could not solve the problem. ""Otherwise, we will go to the masses"".

VHP did not, however, believe in militant means to achieve its goal, he said.

Blaming secularism for destroying ""spiritual life of this country,"" Singhal said: ""We will uproot secularism. We are born for it. We will do it under the constitutional rights we have.""

Stating that secularism was becoming a ""dead philosophy"", he said secularism as taught by ""our sages and munis will be established.""

15,LS adjourned amid furore over disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day on Thursday amid strong protests from the Opposition and some NDA partners over the governmentâ€™s alleged move to disinvest in oil majors BPCL and HPCL.

The government sought to deflect the issue by offering to advance the slated discussion on the subject. ""The government has never blocked any discussion; a response to the concerns can come only through a discussion,"" parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj said admitting that she had assured the Opposition earlier that the character of the oil PSUs would not change without a discussion.

With the tumult rising, Congress and Left members rushed to the well of the House. Unable to persuade them to return to their seats, Speaker Manohar Joshi adjourned the House for the day.

Earlier, an agitated opposition accused the government of going ahead with privatising the oil companies bypassing Parliament. CPM group leader Somnath Chatterjee said more than 300 Lok Sabha members were opposed to disinvestment in BPCL and HPCL.

""Let the government say that the disinvestment process in the oil PSUs has not begun,"" Congress chief whip P R Das Munshi said. He recalled the government assurance that no such step would be taken without a discussion in Parliament.

Members of Shiv Sena, an NDA constituent, also opposed the privatisation move. Lok Janshakti leader Ram Vilas Paswan said privatisation of the oil companies had clear security implications.

16,BJP to go it alone in elections,"PATNA: The BJP would go it alone in the assembly polls due in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Delhi later this year.

BJP national general secretary Pramod Mahajan on Thursday said: ""The BJP has decided to go it alone in the assembly polls in the four states in what is going to be the last and crucial trial of strength between the BJP and the Congress â€” before the next Lok Sabha elections.""

""These elections are of vital importance to us not only because they are the last test of strength before the 2004 poll, but also because these are the states BJP once ruled. Also, most of the MPs there belong to our party or have won with our backing,"" he said.

Predicting landslide victory for the BJP in all the four states, Mahajan said people of the four states wanted change since the Congress party had been ruling Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for the past 10 years and Rajasthan and Delhi for the past five years. He added that both the BJP and Congress had a strong base in the four states.

Mahajan said Atal Bihari Vajpayee would continue to be the prime ministerial candidate of NDA in the next Lok Sabha elections.

He said that Vajpayee would take oath as the prime minister for the fourth consecutive time if the NDA retained power. Even Indira Gandhi could not achieve this feat, Mahajan said, adding that Vajpayee had already become the first non-Congress Prime Minister to have completed five years in office.

Requesting the Opposition parties to support the two proposed Constitution Amendment Bills to stop defection, besides limiting the size of the Cabinet to 10 per cent of the total strength of a House, Mahajan said these Bills were aimed at bringing political reforms in the country.
