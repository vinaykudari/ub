6,Khanna swings President’s rule stick,"LUDHIANA: Union minister Vinod Khanna on Sunday said the Centre might impose Presidentâ€™s rule in Punjab if the NDA team, which would visit the state soon, finds the state government guilty of victimising political opponents in the garb of vigilance inquiries under the ongoing anti-corruption drive.

Khanna was addressing the state-level protest rally organised by BJP at Daresi grounds here. He said his party was not against punishing those involved in corruption but at the same time would not tolerate a witchhunt.

Flaying the state government for mauling democratic rights of its political opponents, the Union minister said the way the Punjab government had unleashed a spate of vigilance inquiries against former ministers of the SAD-BJP government showed that no democratically elected government existed in the state.

Khanna said Vaypayee was the first Prime Minister of the country to introduce Lokpal bill in Parliament, which also brought the Prime Ministerâ€™s office under its purview. The Punjab chief minister should uphold democratic traditions and not indulge in political vendetta as he himself was a democratically elected leader, the minister said.

Stating that the Centre is keeping a close watch on the developments in Punjab, Khanna said the Amarinder government has turned the state into â€˜police raj.â€™ Continuing the tirade, Union minister Sayed Shahnawaz said if the state government is sincere in rooting out corruption, it should also inquire into the misdeeds of Congress ministers.

He also threatened to adopt a tit-fortat policy when returned to power in the state. Talking about Gujarat, Shahnawaz alleged if the Congress party were in power at the Centre, communal violence would have engulfed the entire country. He attacked Congress for failing to save Babri Masjid during its tenure and also mentioned its role in the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.

Punjab BJP president Brij Lal Rinwa said the state BJP would organise similar rallies all over the state from September 3.

7,Bihar industrialists fear job quota in new policy,"PATNA: Bihar has been going without a new industrial policy for about two years since the industrial policy of 1995 lapsed in August 2000.

As a result of this, industries in the state, particularly the small-scale industrial (SSI) units, are gasping for the breath of life due to the lack of incentives.

According to industries minister Vishwa Mohan Sharma, the draft new industrial policy, after being okayed recently by the empowered committee headed by the development commissioner, has been sent to chief minister Rabri Devi through the chief secretary for her approval, he said.

After the CM''s approval, the draft new industrial policy will be sent to the cabinet for its approval. All this may take a few months'' time, Sharma maintained, adding that the proposed policy is likely to be passed by October.

The old industrial policy, which lapsed in August 2000, was extended by the state government in February 2002 with the retrospective effect from August 2000.

Some industries department officials, including director (technical) Mahesh Prasad, think that the government has done its job by extending the old policy. But the captains of industries, including Bihar Industries Association president B P S Keshri, are of the view that the government has performed only a ritual by extending the 1995 policy which provides little incentive for the growth of SSI units.

But what incentives for growth are in store in the draft new industrial policy is still not very clear to the industrialists while the industries department officials appear to be shying away from stating the actual position.

When contacted, Prasad told TNN that he was very busy with other work. The draft new industrial policy had already been sent for the CM''s approval, and he did not remember anything about the provisions of the draft policy, he added.

The industrial development commissioner was not available for comments despite repeated efforts to contact him.

On the other hand, a number of industrialists are fear-stricken following some unconfirmed reports that the draft policy contains the provision for job reservation in the industries.

A leading industrialist, requesting anonymity, expressed his apprehension that if the job reservation provision is included in the new policy, the industrial growth of the state would be hampered as the industries would have to wait for roster clearance.

Keshri said in 1995 itself the pre-production incentives announced in the industrial policy to prop up new SSI units had been withdrawn.

There were post-production incentives by way of either deferment of sales tax payment or exemption from sales tax for a specified period. But with the lapse of the 1995 policy in August 2000 they were also withdrawn, he added.

8,Bar council proposes to gag lawyers,"PUNE: The Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa (BCMG) recently passed a resolution restricting advocates from issuing press notes and releases or even giving interviews to news reporters in order to maintain the decorum of the profession.

Following the resolution, chairman of the council, S.E. Avhad, also sent a letter to the All-Bombay Advocates Bar Association advising it against giving details of court cases to the press.

9,Citizens’ panel to monitor enforcement of road rules,"PUNE: The city police will soon form a Central Traffic Advisory Committee (CTAC), comprising prominent citizens and traffic activists, to monitor day-to-day enforcement of traffic rules and regulations.

The work of shortlisting the experts is in progress and the committee will be formed within a fortnight, Pune police commissioner Ranjitsingh Sharma has announced. Addressing a seminar on Puneâ€™s traffic problems, organised by the Pune Vikas Pratishthan (PVP) here on Saturday, Sharma said the first meeting of the committee will be held on September 1.

Sharma took a serious cognisance of the complaints raised by the citizens about the irregularities in enforcement of the traffic rules, and admitted the need to seek citizensâ€™ participation.

Sharma pointed out that the police have formed similar committees at zonal levels. However, in order to develop a holistic approach to deal with the complaints of the citizens, a central committee must be formed.

Asked what was the need to form yet another committee when the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) already has established a traffic mobility committee, Sharma argued that the mobility committee mainly focuses on traffic planning and various solutions to redress the traffic problems.

The CTAC will have a limited, but a very important task of redressing the complaints of the citizens about the day to day enforcement of traffic regulations by the police. Sharma, however, refuted the charges that a majority of the traffic cops are corrupt and often harass the citizens.

â€œI have never claimed that all my men are pious. But, similarly there have been cases when citizens, who flout the traffic rules bribe constables. If we indulge in mudslinging then we will not be able to work out a solution,â€� Sharma said.

Reacting to a barrage of complaints raised by the citizens about the non-availability of rickshaws at the pre-paid rickshaw stands, Sharma said the functioning of the pre-paid rickshaw stands in the city was satisfactory.

Claiming that the public address system installed at 25 traffic booths in the city has helped in educating the citizens about traffic rules, Sharma said such address system will now be installed at all prominent chowks.

Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ravindra Sengaonkar pointed out that the traffic police collect around Rs 4 crore per annum as fine from the citizens caught flouting traffic norms. However, all these funds go to the state governmentâ€™s coffers.

Sengaonkar said he has sent a proposal demanding the state government to part with at least half of the fine amount so that it can be used for purchasing equipment like breath analysers and vehicle jammers.

Minister of state for public works Balasaheb Shivarkar assured he would ask the state to clear the proposal.

During the meeting, Sengaonkar underlined the need for controllng the long processions carried out during religious festivals. He said traffic police in Pune face a tough task as Pune holds processions for almost 70 days in a year.

MLC Sharad Ranpise, traffic planner Shriniwas Bonala, Shila Padmanabhan of Nirdhar and PVP president Anant Gadgil participated in the three-hour-long seminar and deliberated on the various traffic issues.

11,"BJP desperate to win polls, says Congress","NEW DELHI: Countering deputy Prime Minister L K Advaniâ€™s charges against the Opposition, the Congress party maintained that far from getting stabilised after the Goa national executive, the BJP is â€˜â€˜desperateâ€™â€™ to win even a single assembly election.

Reacting to Advaniâ€™s claim that Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi is the second most popular person in the country, the Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said, â€˜â€˜We hope and trust that the Bharat Ratna is not proposed to be conferred upon Modi.â€™â€™

He argued that the BJP has not won a single state assembly in the country in the last two and half years except Goa by one seat and huge defections. â€˜â€˜If the BJP is so sure of winning elections at any time in Gujarat, it shouldnâ€™t have exhibited extreme desperation by threatening and pressurising the Election Commission to have polls now,â€™â€™ said Singhvi.

12,Shekhawat: A mass leader and master in politics,"NEW DELHI: A consummate politician, the new Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat is a mass leader and firm upholder of high political principles.

Shekhawat, who has been thrice chief minister of Rajasthan and led the Opposition for years in the desert state, is a BJP stalwart and has reached the pinnacle of glory by his sheer diligence, and showing a personal trait of winning friends and making no enemies.

Born on October 23, 1923 in a small village Khachariyawas in Sikar district, Shekhawat however gives credit for reaching the high office to destiny and ""magic of democracy."" A political career spanning more thanb 50 years amply demonstrates his gradual growth as a fine legislator, an able administrator and a charismatic leader learning from his personal experiences excelling his contemporaries with his perseverance and rustic wisdom.

The death of his father in early age forced Shekhawat, eldest son in the family, to leave education after passing high school and join police service to support the family before independence. However, the dawn of independence saw young Shekhawat quit the police job and plunging into electoral politics, successfully contesting the first Assembly election from Danta-Ramgarh constituency in 1952 on Jan Sangh ticket.

13,CBI asks FBI to quiz Taliban minister in IC-814 case,"NEW DELHI: In a new twist to the case of hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane in 1999, the CBI has sought FBI''s assistance to question the then-Taliban Foreign Minister Mullah Abdul Wakil Muttawakil, who is presently in the custody of the American investigating agency.

Highly-placed CBI sources said that the request had been forwarded to FBI through proper channel and its response was encouraging.

It may be mentioned that FBI has also registered a case against unknown persons following a complaint lodged by an American national, who was on-board the flight IC-814 that was hijacked from Kathmandu to Kandahar on December 24, 1999.

The CBI has alleged that Muttawakil, who was the point man in the negotiations on behalf of the hijackers with the Indian Government, was also involved in the conspiracy.

His role came to the fore after the pilots of an Indian rescue plane that carried the-then Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh to Kandahar told the investigators that the jeep of Muttawakil had returned to Kandahar airport''s tarmac and taken away two bags belonging to the five hijackers, the sources said.

The role of Muttawakil as a negotiator was also ""shady"" as per the statements of the team members who had gone to negotiate with the five hijackers, they said. The CBI said the five hijackers -- Sunny Ahmed Qazi, Ibrahim Athar, Zahoor Ibrahim, Shahid Akhter Sayed and Shakir -- had used Muttawakil''s jeep to take away the three prisoners -- Masood Azhar, Omar Sheikh and Mushtaq Zargar -- released in exchange for the passengers of IC-814 after a week-long ordeal.

During the probe and revelations from other documents, the CBI also alleged that Masood Azhar was the ""most respected"" person for Taliban leader Mullah Omar and was a close-confidante of terrorist master-mind Osama bin Laden, the sources said.

They said now these allegations would have to be further corroborated during the interrogation of Muttawakil.

Muttawakil surrendered before the US troops on February 9 this year after an international alliance led by American troops launched an attack on Taliban regime for failing to handover bin Laden, the main accused in the September 11 suicide strikes on World Trade Centre and Pentagon.

The CBI has arrested three persons -- Abdul Latif, Dilip Kumar Bhujel and Bhupal Man Damai -- and their trial was going under various sections of Indian Penal Code at the Sessions court in Patiala.

16,Ravi happy with Krishna govt,"BANGALORE: Within minutes after arriving in Bangalore on Monday, his first official visit as AICC general secretary Karnataka in-charge, Vayalar Ravi gave a good certificate to Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on his administration.

``I am glad the Krishna government is undertaking welfare measures for the poor. For, it was this initiative of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi which electrified the nation in 1970s. I am sure the Karnataka government will fulfil the dreams of the people,'''' he told a jam-packed hall of Congress workers.

Ravi is the third AICC general secretary who has given the `good administration tag'' to Krishna. Earlier, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ambika Soni in their appraisal of the Congress government''s performance had rated it the best to be emulated by other CMs.

Addressing the workers, Ravi thanked the workers for fulfilling the ``herculean task'''' of bringing back the Congress government in the state. ``People voted for the party as it had portrayed a united face. All the leaders worked well with full cooperation from party workers,'''' he added.

This exhibition of unity paid off well and made people believe in the party. ``We should keep the spirit of unity alive in the party and retain it. That is the inherent strength of the party,'''' he said, in an obvious reference to a few discordant notes following the recent cabinet reshuffle.

Krishna admitted to differences in the party but said it was normal in a party as large as Congress. ``It is like a huge family. Like any normal family, even we have differences. But we should work towards gaining confidence of each other in the family. When this is done, we can go ahead with developmental programmes,'''' he added.

Krishna said the Congress was prepared to face any election in the state. ``We should try to capitalise on the goodwill by carrying forward people''s programmes. Problems are huge and five or 10 years is not enough,'''' he stated.

Ravi on KPCC president: AICC General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Vayalar Ravi said he has not ``applied his mind'''' about who should be the next KPCC president.

``I have not applied my mind about who the new president should be, neither have I received any suggestion or direction from AICC. During my visit, I will elicit the response of Congress workers and take a decision,'''' he told reporters after the party workers'' meeting.

17,"School, college bandh gets mixed response","BANGALORE: Amidst poor response to the indefinite school and college bandh in Bangalore on Monday, the Karnataka State Private Educational Institutions Managements and Employees Federation Joint Action Committee claimed that the bandh was ""a success"" throughout the state.

Committee president Basavaraj Horatti said that the bandh was successful in Mysore, Mandya, Hassan, Tumkur, Raichur, Bellary, Gulbarga, Udupi, Belgaum, Hubli-Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri and Davanagere.

Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.K. Chandrashekar said a meeting with the management representatives has been convened on August 26 to discuss these issues. ""We have appealed to them to withdraw the agitation as most of their demands have been met. The bureaucratic hurdles to appoint 1,892 teachers in aided schools has been removed. I have responded to each one of their demands and explained the hurdles in implementing some of them,"" he said.

One of the main demands of the managements is lifting of the three-year ban on recruitment in aided institutions. Though Chandrashekar has maintained that a government order lifting the three-year ban on recruitment of high school teachers in aided institutions had been issued, the managements contend that the bureaucratic hurdles continue.

""We have not heard anything from the state government so far. The indefinite strike will continue till we hear positive action from the government,"" Horatti said.

Some of the other demands of managements include: withdrawing the order issued to recover notional increments, extending financial aid to all private educational institutions opened till 1992 as against only SC/ST run institutions and to stop discrimination between government and aided institutions.

As many as 23 associations have extended their support to the strike. The Federation of Degree College Principals Association issued a press note on Monday supporting the strike.

At the district and taluk levels, demonstrations were held before the deputy commissioner and tahsildars'' offices on Monday. ""From Tuesday, sit-in agitations would be held at specific places everyday till the issues are resolved,"" Horatti said.

The situation in J&K was fragile after terrorist groups with links in many countries making the state their target.Reacting to the demand for resignation of Union minister Pramod Mahajan, the SP leaders remarked that in the Indian tradition, a public figure would have to be above all doubts. ""It is like Ram asking Sita for a second ordeal only because a washerman had doubts about her,"" they said. Replying to a question, Singh said: ""Faced with a similar situation, I would have resigned.""However, they objected to what they termed as 'media trial' and charges without basis.

The Congress meet will be addressed by, besides Vaghela, AICC leader Kamal Nath, Amarsinh Chaudhary, Narhari Amin and other leaders. The party plans to make the meet a launching pad from which it can mount a campaign against BJP''s ''misrule'' both at the state and the Centre. Vaghela will start his campaign after taking the blessing of the Shardapith at Somnath.

The Congress chief told TNN on Monday that the core issues which affected people would be raised by party leaders in their tirade against the BJP. Issues like power, water and crop insurance would be taken up.

Vaghela was given a rousing welcome by the Congress workers when he reached Veraval on Monday. Some 511 two-wheelers rode ahead his motorcade from the entry point in the city to the hotel where minority community leader Abdul Rehman Panja welcomed him.

After the ceremony, he was led to the Satta bazar where he addressed traders and highlighted their problems. A large number of BJP workers joined the Congress together with some members of the Koli samaj.

Addressing a press conference in Rajkot, the GPCC president said the BJP had failed to read the situation before going in for dissolution of the state Assembly. ""The BJP had not anticipated the present problems before going in for the dissolution. Another reason which may have forced the BJP to dissolve the House in a hurry was the growing dissidence among its rank and file.""

Taking a dig at the party, he said: ""Who set up the Election Commission, who formed the Human Rights commission, and who set up the minorities commission... All these were not Congress creations. Hence the BJP must stop making noises about the observations made by such autonomous bodies."" Vaghela said people of Gujarat would not pardon the BJP for asking for early elections.

Asked to comment on some of his erstwhile colleagues like Dattaji Chirandas and Chiman Shukla going back to the BJP, Vaghela said, ""It makes no difference to me.""

Perhaps the harshest criticism by the engineers has been on the proposal of the state government to slash down state energy requirements filed by the PSEB. In its ARR, the electricity board had projected the energy sale figure of Rs 22,347 MUs.

However, the state government, in its objections, slashed down the figure to 21,200 MUs, the association release said.

â€˜â€˜While the state requires 5 to 5.5 per cent increase in energy to maintain progress and growth rate of eight per cent, Punjab government has tried to turn the clock back and retard the stateâ€™s progress by slashing the energy requirement by five per cent,â€™â€™ it added.

In fact, a large slash has been applied to the component of energy purchase proposal of the PSEB.

PSEB had proposed to purchase 7,812 MUs of power, the state government slashed down to 5,702 MUs and the corresponding revenue requirement from Rs 1556 crore to Rs 910 crore.

â€˜â€˜If the energy purchases are to be restricted to Rs 910 crore then by mid-October, this limit will be exhausted and from mid-October (as per proposal of Punjab government) PSEB should stop purchasing any further power from the Centre. It will imply an energy deficit of the order of 200 to 250 lakh units leading to unimaginable power cuts in the range of 12 hour per day,â€™â€™ it said.

Apart from this objection, the association has strenuously objected to the proposal of the state government to prepare a road map to reduce transmission and distribution losses, pilferage etc and implement it in a definite time frame starting from the current year.

The engineers said that cutting T& losses is not merely a technical problem but more of an administrative, law and order problem one that the state government has to help the board with.
