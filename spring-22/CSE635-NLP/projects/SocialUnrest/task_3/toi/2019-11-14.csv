1,No riots sans govt wanting it: Gill,"NEW DELHI: Riots would not take place if the government did not want them to, said supercop KPS Gill here on Wednesday.

Speaking at the Indo-French seminar on secularism, Gill, who was sent as adviser to the Gujarat government during the post-Godhra communal violence, said no riots could take place if political establishment is impartial.

He said the number of people actually involved in the Gujarat riots was very small. Financially well-off people were involved. Most lootings were indulged in by those coming in cars. Nearly 60 per cent killings took place in 10 to 12 incidents.

Gill said that during his stay in Gujarat, he made those policemen suspected of having pro-BJP or pro-VHP image work with the minorities. Secularists chose to condemn communities. It was necessary to take them out of the mind-set built over years of rioting and demotivate them, he added.

2,Cong to protest against Modi's midnight rally,"VADODARA: Caretaker Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s Gaurav Yatra is in the eye of a storm again. This time around, the city police''s attitude of looking the other way when Modi''s public meeting was going on till the wee hours on Tuesday, has raked up a major controversy with the Congress planning to raise a protest against the same.

What has rattled the Congress is the fact that the rally continued beyond midnight despite the presence of police. Modi had reached the venue at around 12 midnight on Tuesday after a series of rallies in Kheda and Panchmahals districts as part of the ninth phase of the Gaurav Yatra.

The public meeting at Jubelibaug here lasted till around 2 am. Several officers of the city police were present at the rally, but allegedly took no steps to ensure that the rally was wound up early.

The Opposition Congress party''s city unit has pounced on the issue and is leaving no stone unturned to embarrass the BJP and the city police. A delegation of party functionaries went to police commissioner''s office on Wednesday to seek a clarification on the issue.

While the delegation could not meet police commissioner D D Tuteja, they met officers in the special branch and asked them to clarify things. Office-bearers of the city unit of the party said that the officers ""did not have any justification for letting the meeting continue well beyond the 10 pm deadline set by the Election Commission (EC)"".

General secretary of the city Congress Vasant Patni said that the meeting should not have continued beyond the deadline set by the EC. ""Or is it that the caretaker chief minister is being given special privileges by the city police. Besides, the officers in the city police were not able to tell us if they had any valid reason to allow the rally to continue,"" Patni said.

Patni pointed out that officers in the special branch had claimed that they had received a facsimile message stating that the rally should be allowed. However, he added, the officers were not able to tell from where the message had come.

A delegation of the Congress party will now meet Tuteja on Thursday to raise the issue. ""We want to know if other leaders will be allowed to do the same. If not, then the city police must be able to give us valid reasons for making an exception on this occasion,"" a senior Congress worker said.

Workers of the party also pointed out that the Supreme Court guidelines also came in the way of such late night public meeting wherein loud speakers were used. They pointed out that the city police had cited the same guidelines when they wanted to stop late night garbas in the city.

Meanwhile, Tuteja was not available for comment.

3,PM's debt relief for farmers in drought-hit areas,"NEW DELHI: The Union government had decided to instruct banks not to collect any loan dues this year from farmers in areas officially declared to be drought-affected, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said here on Wednesday.

Vajpayee further said that the Centre had decided to create a corpus of Rs 500 crore, with the state governments also contributing, for the plantation sector. The money would be used for providing relief to growers ""when market conditions are depressed"". The scheme''s details would be finalised soon.

The announcement also mentioned a special rescheduling of current loans to coffee growers.

The loan-collection announcement does not make a substantial change on the ground, since all banks and government rural credit institutions had more than three months ago been instructed to reschedule all short-term loans due this year from farmers in the drought-affected areas.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Nabard, the two apex institutions in this regard, had in July itself, given instructions to convert all short-term loans due this year into long-term ones without compounding any dues, to relax existing credit limits and to also give new loans for deepening existing borewells or installing new ones.

They had also given instructions to ensure that the accounting rules were relaxed to display loan non-payments on this account as standard assets.

Hence, the PM''s announcement only takes the process a formal step further, agro-credit officials told this newspaper. They point out that the PM''s announcement does not mean that dues have been written off; they will all be collected next year, with whatever is due then.

Wednesday''s announcement is the latest of a series of measures made by the Centre to help farmers in the drought-affected areas. The others include a Rs 5 to Rs 20 bonus for each quintal of crop procured in these areas by state agencies and issue of 1.3 million tonnes of foodgrain to 14 affected states, in addition to issue of Rs 11.9 billion under the Calamity Relief Fund and advance releases of money under the Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojana and the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme.

In his statement, Vajpayee said that the drought''s effects would have to be tackled ""with fortitude and prudence"" till at least May-June next year. His government, he said, would do whatever it could to alleviate farmers'' dificulties. He added that he expected the state governments to do likewise.

Addressing a press conference here during which he lost his cool several times, Tohra said ""it was a win of Hindu fundamentalists due to efforts of both Congress and BJP and ditching of the Sikh pant"" by his bete noire Parkash Singh Badal, chief minister Amarinder Singh and Akali leader Simranjit Singh Mann.

Tohra, who began the conference expressing ""satisfaction"" at the conduct of the elections on Tuesday, ended up declaring that he did not accept the verdict and would consider moving the High court to challenge the outcome.

Tohra''s behaviour during the conference upset the journalists so much that they refused to have tea and snacks. However, they were later persuaded back after Tohra apologised for his anger and admitted that the ire was directed against ""someone else but it came out here.""

He alleged that Hindu fundamentalist, whom he did not identify directly, ensured win of Badal, who had agreed to toe their line. ""Whatever Hindus are doing in Gujarat they are doing in Punjab trying to make India a land of hindus.""

He said Badal has ""surrendered"" before Hindu fundamentalists. ""We were facing four governments - Centre, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh in the run up to the SGPC elections,"" Tohra said adding ""whether it is a Congress or a BJP led government at the centre they have always opposed Panthic forces.""

7,Govt colleges turn to personality development,"BANGALORE: All government colleges in the State will soon have learning centres on their campuses to mould students'' personalities, Higher Education Minister G. Parameshwara said here on Thursday.

Speaking after signing an MoU with the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), a statutory body of the University Grants Commission (UGC), to jointly promote quality in higher education, Parameshwara said the primary objective of these centres would be to gear students up to meet the challenges in the corporate world. ""From inter-personal skills to communication skills, these centres will help students mould their personality. In the first phase, the centres will be established in 25 colleges,"" he added.

Stating that the NAAC had commenced assessment in 34 government colleges, the minister said an ""academic counselling and mentorship"" programme in 50 colleges would commence soon. Fifty teachers have been trained by the NAAC to act as facilitators for the unique programme.

The Education Department was in the process of doing away with the traditional courses and introducing new courses like e-governance. ""We have realised the need for including Information Technology (IT) skills in every stream of education. The department is in the process of effecting suitable changes in the course content,"" he said.

With a view to improving infrastructure in colleges, the government received a loan of Rs 23 crore from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco). Of this Rs 5 crore will be spent on technical education (upgradation of polytechnics), Rs 18.7 crore on collegiate education, the minister said.

Outlining the need for a professional short-term course for lecturers, Parameshwara said teachers must be trained suitably to ensure quality education.

8,"Go for plastic money, Krishna urges farmers","BANGALORE: Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Thursday urged Karnataka''s farmers to take a leaf out of the lifestyle of the West and switch to using credit cards instead of hard currency.

Even as the thousands of farmers gathered at the inauguration of the 49th All India Cooperatives Week gaped at the incomprehensible words, Krishna, who arrived an hour late said: ""We should look to the Western countries like US, England, Germany or even Japan. They do not take notes out of their pockets to buy everyday things, like we do. They use credit cards and they get a good idea of their monthly expenditure.""

On the subject of insurance, Krishna said: ""Those of us who are rich can afford life insurance. But none of us even go for regular health check-ups, though in the West, everyone goes for a check-up once a year be it US President George Bush or England''s Queen Elizabeth or their Prime Minister Tony Blair, everyone has health insurance.""

Advocating the Yashaswini health insurance scheme, which he earlier launched through a ""virtual"" pooja -- complete with bells, flowers, incense and aarati -- Krishna said: ""Under this scheme, if anyone of you or your family members suffers from any health problem, you can avail medical help. If more people go for the Yashaswini programme, the demands on the CM''s fund for medical expenses, which come from MLAs, MLCs and MPs will come down.""

Krishna said like cooperation, insurance should be a way of life. ""We have seen disastrous climatic conditions with the rains playing hide and seek with us for two years. Those who had their crop insured got Rs 128 crore, which we released. Don''t plant any crop unless you can insure it,"" he said.

Earlier, cardiologist Devi Shetty explained the Yashaswini scheme under which each insured person has to pay Rs 5 per month -- Rs 60 annual premium -- and get almost any operation done for free at 50 hospitals anywhere in the state. With 1.65 lakh farmers registering for the programme, a premium of Rs 1 crore was given to Dr Shetty at the function.
