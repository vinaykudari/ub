1,Wheat row: govt says we're ready,"NEW DELHI: The Centre said on Monday that all necessary steps would be taken to thwart US agriculture major Monsanto''s bid to secure European patent for Indian wheat.

Additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi told the Supreme Court that the government would take appropriate measures if it is found that Monsanto was getting the patent on Indian wheat.

A Bench headed by Chief Justice V N Khare, currently seized of a public interest petition by the Research Foundation for Science and Technology and Vandana Shiva saying the government was not serious in filing the objections to Monsanto''s patent bid, had earlier issued notices to the Centre and its ministries concerned.

Petitioners'' counsel Pinky Anand and D N Goburdhan said that in 1990, Unilever applied before the European Patent Office for a patent of wheat derived from a traditional Indian variety. In 1998, Unilever''s wheat division was acquired by Monsanto and five years later, the patent on wheat was granted to Monsanto, they added.

Referring to a Parliament question in this regard, counsel said the government had clarified that the patent was on a new variety of wheat for use in Europe and that the Indian variety was not covered under the patent.

The petitioners alleged that the government did not appear serious in filing them.

2,"LS polls: Enemies yesterday, allies today","PATNA: RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav has described the coming Lok Sabha polls as a battle between the Kauravas and Pandavas. ""But the brothers always keep changing sides here,"" remarked a senior RJD leader wearily, insisting that the dividing line between Kauravas and Pandavas has become blurred.

Two critics of Laloo - Raghunath Jha and Devendra Prasad Yadav - are expected to formally join RJD on Tuesday. There is a move within the RJD to field Jha from Bettiah seat while Yadav will be the candidate for Jhanjharpur - the same seat he represented as a JD(U) MP. ""Overnight one becomes a secular and communal,"" remarked a former CM.

The ''brothers changing sides'' include Anwarul Haque the RJD MP who switched his loyalty to the BJP and is expected to contest from BJP. Pappu Yadav, another MP from Purnia, who had sworn to throw out the Laloo-Rabri regime, has joined hands with Laloo. Both Anwarul and Yadav have their arguments. ""The BJP has been defamed in the eyes of Muslims by the so-called secularists,"" remarked Haque.

""Laloo is not an issue. The main issue is to defeat communalism"", remarked Pappu Yadav.

Joining the BJP are sitting RJD MPs, Sukhdev Paswan from Araria reserved seat and Nagmani (also a Union minister) who won from Chatra. Jainarayan Nishad has the reputation of contesting as a RJD candidate in 1996 and in 1998 as a NDA candidate, both successfully. This time he has switched his loyalties from JD(U) to the BJP.

LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan leads the lot. A Laloo candidate in 1996 from Hajipur, a JD(U) candidate in 1998 and 1999, he is all set to contest from Laloo''s secular front. Paswan has claimed that he has shut the doors for dialogue with NDA. Recently Sharad Yadav made an appeal to him to join NDA. The CPI has been swearing to dislodge the Rabri government for the past five years. It is now all tagged up with the RJD front.

The number of ''changing brothers'' may increase as confusion still prevails about the secular front. The Congress is demanding 22 seats. ""They have to convince us that their situation has changed since 1999 polls. We will see to even the list of candidates they wish to field,"" said RJd national vice president Raghubansh Prasad Singh. According to RJD sources, a senior Congress leader has staked him claim for ''any of the seven parliamentary seats''.

""Seeking a secure seat is the first priority and that''s why difference between Kauravas and Pandavas is getting is hazy,"" said a politician.

3,Even ministers want to 'migrate' now,"PATNA: When it comes to migrating from Bihar it''s not only workers, students and businessmen who want to move out, but also politicians.

At present, over a dozen ministers are lobbying for party tickets to contest the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections to ""get out of the state"". The glitter and glamour of Delhi is more attractive to them than being ministers in their own state.

""In Bihar, there is virtually nothing to do for most of the ministers because apart from establishment expenditure there is very little money available to do any other thing. Even the meagre fund available requires the nod of one man (read Laloo),"" remarked an RJD cabinet minister wishing to contest the next Lok Sabha polls.

Old-timers in Bihar politics recall that in the 1960s and 1970s there were Lok Sabha MPs willing to quit their seats to become ministers in Bihar. ""The late B P Mandal ignored the advice of even Ram Manohar Lohia and quit his Lok Sabha seat to become a minister in Bihar in the 1960s,"" recalled an old socialist leader.

But now the reverse is happening in the state with ministers openly proclaiming that they are willing to take a shot at the Lok Sabha polls ""if the leadership wishes them to do so"". There are some leaders like land revenue minister Ramai Ram and food and civil supplies minister Puranmasi Ram of the RJD who have threatened to contest the LS polls even without the blessing of Laloo.

""There are many of us who have seen ''both the worlds'' â€” the state as ministers and Delhi as MPs,"" said Congress minister Shakeel Ahmad. He, along with other ministers in the RJD like Sitaram Yadav, Md Taslimuddin, Rama Devi, Shakuni Choudhary and Chhedi Paswan have been Lok Sabha MPs before and their hearts have again started beating for Delhi as all of them are lobbying for tickets from their parties.

""Given the economic condition of the state we, as ministers, cannot fulfil the needs of the state. There is a perception that the condition of the state government is no better than a Zila Parishad and the real economic and administrative powers lie in Delhi,"" said Bihar''s excise minister Shivanand Tiwari.

He contested the last Lok Sabha polls from Buxar and is now gearing up for a second shot.

So are ministers like Ram Chandra Purbey, Shakeel Ahmad Khan, Akhilesh Singh, Upendra Prasad Verma and others. They are waiting for Laloo to give them an opportunity.

4,"Finally, it's simultaneous polls","BANGALORE: Ending the suspense, chief minister S.M. Krishna on Monday formally requested Governor T.N. Chaturvedi to dissolve the Karnataka Legislative Assembly on February 23.

This followed a unanimous resolution taken by the cabinet, which met at 10 am, followed by the council of ministers. After the meetings, Krishna read out the formal letter addressed to the Governor: ""The state cabinet met to seek dissolution of the state assembly on February 23, 2004. As CM of Karnataka, I am sending you the recommendation. I request you to be pleased to take appropriate steps for dissolution.""

Speaking to reporters on the steps of Raj Bhavan, Krishna said: ""We conveyed our decision to go for elections along with Lok Sabha. We suggested the date for dissolution, but it depends on the Governor''s decision.""

Raj Bhavan sources said the cabinet has the right to ask for dissolution of assembly on a pre-specified date. ""The Governor will now consider the recommendation only on February 23,"" sources added.

Amidst the general atmosphere of bonhomie, Krishna said the Congress party is happy with the decision. Asked if he is hopeful of returning to power, he said: ""We will rebound like a tennis ball hit on the wall.""

The election schedule was left to the Chief Election Commission. ""The CEC has been saying if dissolution takes place in time, it is logical to consider simultaneous elections.""

Krishna gave twin reasons for dissolution: confidence of getting re-elected and public good.

""The expenditure is not on me or the CEC but on the common man, who is reeling under severe drought. Somebody has to protect them. We could have stayed in power till October 24, but confident of re-election, we are curtailing our term.""

Asked if the Centre had thrust elections on the state, Krishna said Karnataka would have waited till September.

""Still, whether it is an advantage or not, we would like to set a precedent. Both in 1989 and 1999, joint elections were held and we won. Now opportunity has come our way without asking, we will make the best of it.""

He brushed aside the reported opposition of some MLAs to joint polls with: ""You did not come to the Congress Legislature Party meeting, did you? We took a joint decision.""

On polarisation of political parties, Krishna said it was taking place in bits and pieces in the state. ""The situation is fluid. Let me make it clear that we don''t see any reason for electoral alliances, but several persons within and outside legislature are concerned about casteist forces and want to be part of a larger secular movement.""

To a specific query on urban development minister D.K. Shivakumar''s offer to give up the Sathanur constituency for him, his response was: ""That shows my friend''s special consideration towards me.""

6,EC grapples with govt request on DPM status,"NEW DELHI: The Constitution comes in the way of the government''s request to the Election Commission that DPM L K Advani enjoy the special status as is enjoyed by the PM, during electioneering without attracting any penalty under the model code of conduct.

The EC, which is the sole authority in this matter, is grappling with the issue ever since the request landed in Nirvachan Sadan. Ironically, the request was made by former home secretary N Gopalaswami, who would now have to sit on judgment over his own request as election commissioner.

""We are looking at the Constitution. It does not talk about the post of DPM. Article 74 merely says there would be a council of ministers with the PM at the head to aid and advise the President. The DPM is a cabinet minister in the eyes of the Constitution. Special status can only be given by setting a precedent,"" a EC source said.

But, he added, this could open a ""floodgate"".

According to him, security is the main reason why the government wants the DPM to enjoy the same status as is enjoyed by the PM. But the risk spreads across the political landscape.

9,Bhattal in LS polls only if Amarinder is fielded,"NEW DELHI: In an apparent bid to prevent her exit from power play in Punjab, Deputy Chief Minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal Tuesday said she would agree to contest Lok Sabha polls only if the party high command decided to field her as well as Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.

Bhattal told reporters here that she had no intention of fighting the Lok Sabha polls but would help other candidates win.

She, however, said she would contest only if the party high command decided to field the chief minister also.

Bhattal had a running feud with Amarinder, whose removal she had demanded, before the Congress high command brokered peace between the rival factions in ruling Congress in the state under a deal which saw her becoming the deputy chief minister in January.

On the chances of Congress in the state, Bhattal said ""difference were already appearing in Akali Dal. But Congress stands united and we hope to win all the seats"".

10,"CM lying, govt failed to fulfill demands: Hazare","RALEGAN SIDDHI: Calling Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde a liar, noted social crusader Anna Hazare on Tuesday rejected Shindeâ€™s claim that the government has fulfilled all his demands. ""He is lying which not only undermines the prestige of the post he holds but also endangers democracy,"" Hazare stated.

Hazare who has lost five kg weight since February 9 when he started his indefinite fast, was looking very tired and weak when TNN met him at Yadavbaba temple on Tuesday morning. A steady stream of followers continued and Hazare made it a point to meet them even though the activity took its toll on his strength.

Speaking to TNN, Hazare wondered why Shinde was sending ministers and bureaucrats to act as mediators if he was so sure that all his demands have been fulfilled. ""The chief minister heads the state and should not make false statements. Whom should the people look up to if the chief minister starts telling lies? He should think before he speaks and whatever he says must be implemented,"" he remarked.

Hazare pointed out that although seven months have passed since the Maharashtra right to information act was passed by the Assembly, the government has not appointed information officers, appellate authorities and formed the state level commission. The Lokaa-yukta has not been given additional powers and meetings of regional information committees have not begun, he added. ""Why is the chief minister telling so many lies?,"" he asked.

He also stated that ever since he filed a petition in the Bombay high court regarding the fake stamp paper scam masterminded by Telgi, the government has become scared. â€œI feel that they are taking revenge but they donâ€™t realise that I have strong backing of common peopleâ€�, he remarked.

On other demands made by him, he said that Gramsabhas are yet to receive additional powers to help check corruption. â€œIn fact I donâ€™t think that the chief minister and the chief secretary realise the important role of Gramsabhas. They need to be trainedâ€�, he observed. He said that the government has dragged its feel over the demands since 1999 and now alleged that he (Hazare) sat on indefinite hunger strikes just ahead of elections.

Answering a question whether he would break his fast if the government fulfilled his demands, Hazare replied in the negative. â€œI have no hope now. I have decided not to expect anything from the government. If they want to do something, tell them to do it after I dieâ€�, he remarked. He clarified that he will not give any more chances to the government saying that it was not as if he was asking something for himself or his village. â€œIt is unfortunate that people have to start agitations for things which the government should have done on its ownâ€�, he pointed out.

When asked whether he felt that things would change after a new government came to power in the state, Hazare said that all political parties were the same. â€œThe BJP-Sena government went a step ahead of the Congress government when it came to corruption. The Democratic Front government has gone even further. It has become a coalition only for sharing the spoilsâ€�, he said.

Answering a question about the conciliatory efforts of co-operation commissioner Umeshchandra Sarangi, Hazare said that he has told Sarangi not to bother any more. â€œEvery time I start a fast the government sends people who are close to me and as soon as I break the fast they make a fool of me. I told Sarangi that the government will not hesitate to make a fool of him as wellâ€�, he remarked.

Commenting on reports about retired IAS officer Arun Bhatia contesting Lok Sabha elections from Pune, Hazare felt that people should support such candidates. â€œIf 15 to 20 such people get elected it will make a difference. They can challenge the political gangs and uphold values and moralsâ€�, he said adding that he would extend his support to candidates like Bhatia.
