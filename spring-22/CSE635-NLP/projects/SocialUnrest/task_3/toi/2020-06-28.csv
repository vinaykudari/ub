0,Digvijay's OBC quota is a political stunt: Uma,"BHOPAL: BJP chief ministerial candidate Uma Bharti has said that chief minister Digvijay Singhâ€™s 27 per cent reservation to other backward castes (OBCs) is only a political stunt.

She told reportes here on Saturday, â€˜â€˜It is an impossible task for Digvijay to implement it as a Supreme Court order had stated total reservation cannot exceed 50 per cent. When the Jayalalithaa government in Tamil Nadu gave reservation exceeding the 50 per cent limit, a Public Interest Litigation was filed. The matter is in the Supreme Court and no state government can now give more than 50 per cent reservation,â€™â€™ she added.

She said Digvijay was playing â€˜â€˜along the cow-slaughter lineâ€™â€™. â€˜â€˜During the cow-slaughter issue, he wrote to the Prime Minister and asked for a Bill in Parliament against cow slaughter. When the Bill was introduced, it was Digvijayâ€™s Congress that opposed it. This is Digvijayâ€™s second political gimmick,â€™â€™ she said.

â€˜â€˜By doing this he has betrayed the OBCs as the state â€˜â€˜has no jobsâ€™â€™. First the chief minister retrenched 30,000 daily wagers, most of them were Dalits and OBCs. Recently he attended a Planning Commission meeting where he promised to retrench 80,000 more government employees. If the CM is out to shut all job opportunities, the talk of enhancing the quota is meaningless,â€™â€™ Bharati said.

1,Stapling of notes spoils RBI's clean note policy,"CHANDIGARH: Practical difficulties are coming in the way of Reserve Bank of India''s (RBI) initiative to usher in clean note policy in the region.

RBI has imposed a complete ban on stapling of notes by the banks. Instead banks have been asked to securely strap the note-packets horizontally and vertically. Banks sources, however, say that it will take some time before unstapled notes become a norm rather than an exception.

Stapling of notes is done by the banks to secure the bundles of currency in order to prevent loss of notes when the bundle passes from one hand to the other. Bank officers dealing with currency, however, say that strapping of notes is at best a temporary measure in securing the notes.

""Once a strap of notes is opened, it cannot be replaced. It becomes necessary to count the notes every time the bundle changes hands.""says a State Bank of India official.

RBI has also instructed the banks to install note counting machines so as to facilitate the counting process. Bank sources, however, say that the installation of these machines in various bank branches is still in its initial phase. ""It will be difficult to enforce the new initiative till such machines are made available with all bank branches,"" the official adds.

Banks have also been asked not to accept stapled currency from the customers. Bigger customers of banks, however, still staple the notes before depositing them.

Senior RBI officials, however, say that the central bank has been unrelenting in pursuing the clean note policy. A senior RBI official says "" It is a new initiative. Stapling the bundles is an old practice. It will take some time to put a complete stop to this.""

The central bank has also asked the general public to accept only unstapled notes from the banks. ""Public awareness is a must to ensure the success of this initiative,"" the official adds.

Stapling of notes is the first step which results in damage to the new currency. RBI officials say that the central bank will not accept stapled currency from commercial banks. Instead, such bundles will now be treated as branch balance with the banks.

Unstapled currency is a norm in the west. Countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan too have put a complete stop to the stapling of notes.

RBI officials say that major government organisations like Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Railways have already started the implementation of unstapled currency in their commercial transactions.

5,Gogoi govt fights Centre's ban as malaria rages,"GUWAHATI: While malaria, having claimed 62 lives in the state, has assumed epidemic proportions, the Tarun Gogoi government is fighting a legal battle on whether to distribute five lakh medicated mosquito nets or not among the affected people.

Gauhati High Court is yet to dispose of the petition filed by the state government against the Centreâ€™s ban on distribution of the nets. The Centre put the ban in view of the CBI probe into anomalies in procurement of the nets.

The Assam government filed a petition last year that New Delhiâ€™s ban was unreasonable considering the spread of the disease. State health and family welfare minister Bhumidhar Barman said rodents might have destroyed the nets at several godowns sealed by CBI. The Centre had sent the nets to Assam when the AGP government was in power.

The anti-malaria programme in Assam, where the disease rears its head every monsoon, is fully sponsored by the Centre. Worse for the state government, the medicines supplied along with the medicated nets were well past the expiry dates. Additional director of health services and state malaria programme officer, P.C. Bhattacharya, said barring Dibrugarh, all the other 22 districts were malaria-prone.

Nagaon has been adversely affected with five confirmed deaths and nine suspected deaths. There have been five confirmed deaths in Sonitpur and eight more are suspected to have been killed. There were four confirmed deaths in Dhemaji, three in North Lakhimpur, two in Golaghat and one each in Cachar and Karbi Anglong districts.

June is being observed as Malaria Month. As part of this campaign, 2,240 camps have been organised for treating affected people. As many as 950 DDT spraying squads have been formed. The health departmentâ€™s woes have been compounded by the shortage of 400 health workers for malaria surveillance operations in villages.

6,Front decides against tabling farm lands,"KOLKATA: Amid stiff resistance from some sections of its Left Front allies, the CPM has decided not to table a controversial Bill for consolidating agricultural land in the state Assembly. The Bill was to be tabled on Saturday.

At a Left Front meeting on Saturday evening, CPM politburo member Jyoti Basu suggested that the proposal for consolidation of land be first discussed with farmersâ€™ bodies. â€œWe can discuss the issue only after they discuss the proposals in detail. They will understand the subject better,â€� Basu said.

He agreed with RSPâ€™s Kshiti Goswami that newspaper reports linking the proposed Bill with similar suggestions made by global consultant Mckinsey could confuse the people on the state governmentâ€™s motives. Goswami said the people feared consolidation of land could only be a prelude to MNCs entering the stateâ€™s farm sector.

A Bill to formulate a code of conduct for teachers was also held up. The Front decided its contents would be discussed by Left Front teachersâ€™ bodies before placing the Bill in the Assembly.

12,Assam govt caught in mosquito net,"GUWAHATI: While malaria, having claimed 62 lives in the state, has assumed an epidemic proportion, the Tarun Gogoi government is fighting a legal battle on whether to distribute five lakh medicated mosquito nets among the affected people.

The Guwahati High Court is yet to dispose off the petition filed by the Assam government against the Centre''s ban on distribution of the medicated nets.

The Assam government filed a petition last year that New Delhi''s ban on distribution of mosquito nets was unreasonable considering the spread of the disease.

Assam health and family welfare minister Bhumidhar Barman told TNN on Friday that rodents might have destroyed the nets at several godowns sealed by the CBI. The Centre had sent the nets to Assam when the AGP government was in power.

The anti-malaria programme in Assam, where the disease rears its head every monsoon, is cent per cent sponsored by the Centre. Adding more disappointment to the Assam government, the medicines, which were supplied along with the medicated nets, were well past the expiry dates.

13,BJP flays Rajasthan's new investment policy,"JAIPUR: The BJP while criticising the new investment policy has termed it as an election stunt. The state government in the last four and a half years has failed to develop an industrial climate in the state. On the one hand no big investment has come in while on the other, thousands of industrial units have become sick in the state.

Vasundhara Raje Scindia, the state president of the BJP said that the state government should first develop an industrial climate in the state. She said that an investment is not made just on rebates and concessions but for attracting it a climate has to be developed.

She said that the state government has failed to develop the infrastructure and only on account of this the industrialists are shying away from the state. Scindia said that ''inspector raj'' is prevalent in the state.

She said that if the chief minister is serious about industrial development then he should provide electricity at cheaper rates to the industrial units and save them from becoming sick.

15,Best Bakery case: Omar Abdullah flays NDA govt,"SRINAGAR: Expressing deep anguish over the verdict in the Best Bakery carnage in Gujarat, National Conference president and MP Omar Abdullah blamed the NDA government for doing nothing even as innocent people were ""brutally murdered"" in Gujarat a year ago.

Their only crime was that they were Muslims.""

Following domestic and international criticism, the government had assured that the guilty would be punished, he added.

Omar added, ""Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done and that will only happen when justice is blind to religion... If Godhra was terrorism then so was what followed.""

The former minister regretted that today justice was no longer blind to caste, creed and religion. While those allegedly guilty in the Godhra train carnage had been booked under Pota, those responsible for the massacre that followed were gradually being set free, he pointed out.

Omar further said, ""The Centre through its silence is condoning what is happening in Gujarat.""

Chanan Singh, a Congress supporter died while Major Singh, Gurmukh Singh, Gurdev Singh, Satnam Singh and Harjinder Singh were injured. Major Singh, whose wife is contesting sarpanchâ€™s election with the support of Congress, blamed SAD MLA from Patti Adesh Partap Singh Kairon for his ""involvement"" in the shoot-out incident.
