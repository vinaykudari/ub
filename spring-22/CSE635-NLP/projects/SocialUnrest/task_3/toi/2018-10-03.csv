5,Christians seek political destiny,"jalandhar:frustrated by the indifference of successive governments, under congress, akali dal and now the sad-bjp alliance, the christians of punjab have decided to form a political front to make their presence felt in the corridors of power. the timing seems appropriate, given the backdrop of the coming vidhan sabha elections. ''we were fed up with our political isolation. of late, some fundamentalist groups have been openly advocating violence against christian missionaries. many have even lost their lives. in punjab, the ruling party invariably ignores our presence despite our contribution to the health and educational infrastructure. so, why should not we assert ourselves,'' questioned koleen chery, popularly known as father roby, in a talk with times news network, on tuesday. ''the splintered nature of christian denominations has made them vulnerable. in this new front, we have representatives from catholics, methodists, pentacostals, anglicans, salvation army, seventh day adventists and others. we are going to be politically active during the coming state elections,'' said father roby, a keralite by birth who has been named chairman of the punjab masihi lok dal. ''the aim is to unite for our social, economic, political and other rights in a democratic set-up. the party will be open to all others who share our condition, even other religious minorities. christians have over 16 lakh votes in punjab. so far, they have voted for either akali dal or congress but neither has done anything for us.we have often been dubbed as 'foreigners' and 'anti-national', in disregard of our contribution to the fields of health and education,'' he said. talking to tnn, pastor gian chand recalled how, for the past many years, the community has been holding its conventions behind closed doors for fear of attacks. he said it all began in 1998 when they planned to organise a convention in amritsar's ranjit avenue. ''it took us four months to get the dc's permission. however, just an hour before the convention, police arrived in full force and uprooted our shamianas. ever since, we have not had the courage to attempt a meeting in the open,'' said the pastor. ''in the last two years, there have been 38 attacks on christians in punjab alone.we are not going to tolerate this any more.we plan to concentrate in this part of punjab before gradually spreading out to uttar pradesh, bihar and orissa. within three weeks, we will have our infrastructure ready at the block and district levels. then we will organise rallies. areas with a large christian presence will be covered first.these include khanuan, dhariwal, gurdaspur, batala, fatehgarh churian, dera baba nanak,ajnala, rajasansi and ferozepur,'' disclosed father roby.

8,Uneasy lies the farmer on his cotton bed,"giddarbaha:as night falls, incandescent lamps light up in many villages in this area. one might think some salesman has conned the farmers into buying expensive gadgets but it is only a desperate measure to trap the dreaded sundi (boll worm) that has nearly eaten up all the crop around here. ''we have tried everything, from insecticides to spraying neela thotha (copper sulfate), but nothing has worked, now we are trying this,'' explains charanjit singh of babania village near here. he says the idea came from a salesman who convinced farmers that this would work. the method is simple. light up a lamp at night and keep a trough filled with water and some kerosene on the ground. if the farmer is lucky, by morning some boll worms will be dead, trapped in the kerosene and water mixture. but the trick does not always work and many farmers have given up hope. ''this insect seems unstoppable,'' voiced a group from chaudhra village near muktsar. they said even spraying undiluted pesticide has no effect on boll worms. local officials say the pest has become resistant to insecticides because of reckless spraying, but farmers deny this. ''we don't know what the problem is but it is not true that we use insecticides without measure. if sundi is not killed after one spray, what would you do except go in for another round,'' argues jagtar singh of thandewala village in muktsar. fearing a repeat of last year's paddy disaster, these farmers diversified greatly into cotton.as luck would have it, this year it is paddy that has done well while cotton has suffered. ''we are helpless.for the last many years, rain has spoilt standing paddy as well as the one in the market.this year, paddy has done well but we have invested heavily in cotton and now the boll worm has destroyed it all,'' says ajaib singh of dullewala village in bathinda district. he devoted almost 60 per cent of his land to cotton. in most mandis in the region, officials and commission agents are of the view that in-flow of paddy will be less by almost 25-30 per cent. ''most of the farmers have heavily diversified into cotton.though it is the usual crop here, but the preference has been for paddy as it offers stability,'' says jagdish singh makkar, a prominent commission agent at kotkapura mandi. most farmers say they are not looking for compensation and if some method could be devised to get rid of the pest, they would be happy.

9,Transparency in govt functioning needed,"kochi: central vigilance commissioner n vittal has stressed the need for greater transparency in government functioning. delivering a talk on 'preventive vigilance and enhancing transparency in administration' at the public sector cochin refineries ltd on monday, vittal said accountability was necessary for good governance. this was possible through transparency in operations. transparency in government would be possible if there was freedom of information and citizens had access to the information, he said. terming delay and lack of transparency as factors breeding corruption, vittal said the hue and cry made when the cvc published on its website the names of charged offices brought home this fact very clearly. the website had also revealed how much delay was taking place in the process. removal of the secrecy by way of greater transparency and speeding up the process were the remedies for effective vigilance, he said. if level of corruption in the country came down to that of scandinavian countries, the gdp would grow by 1.5 per cent and the foreign direct investment (fdi) would be up by 12 per cent, he added. quoting statistics from a study conducted by the phd chamber of commerce and industry to show how corruption came in the way of economic development, vittal said due to corruption the country was losing at least rs 63,800 crore worth of additional investment per annum, roughly three times the present fdi and rs 28,600 crore of consequent national income per annum.

11,"Practise what you preach, govt. told","pune: it's not often that employees lecture their employers on the need to adopt austere measures. but on the birth anniversary of that great practitioner of austerity, mahatma gandhi, that is just what state government employees in the district did. they held a day-long demonstration at which they highlighted the failures of the state's much tom-tommed austerity measures. narayan joshi, who is president of the poona district state government employees federation, said forthrightly:the government should stop its doublespeak on job streamlining and cost-cutting when it cannot even control the size of its own cabinet. predictably, mr joshi attacked the state government's policy of retrenchment of more than 1,30,000 jobs, even as equal number of positions were vacant in various departments. those who are working neither get revised dearness allowance like central employees, nor any bonus due to this approach of the state, he said. the message to the state government to set its own house in order was accompanied by a helpful list of how it could do so. for example, the state government could hold its winter session in mumbai instead of shifting the entire machinery to nagpur for a month. the traditional winter session in nagpur costs about rs 40 crore and the outcome is nothing substantial. similarly, all the cabinet meetings should be held in mumbai, rather than having an extravagant affair in other cities of maharashtra,mr joshi said. also targeted was the huge amount spent on the security of ministers and the dozen-odd cars in ministerial motorcades. sudhir pimple, secretary of the federation asked if it was necessary for ministers newly-appointed to the cabinet to completely refurbish their offices at public expense as they do. even bureaucrats have adopted the practice of renovating their offices with development funds, said an angry government employee in the animal husbandry department. other speakers told of huge equipment purchases made by various departments which lie unused. government hospitals and several other departments have bought obsolete machinery at high cost and then simply dumped them without giving any reason, said one speaker. the message to the government was clear and one that most citizens will sympathise with: tighten your own belt before you preach that others do so. state government employees demonstrate in the city against the new austerity measures, which seem to exempt politicians and bureaucrats.

17,Gill Pati has 'home truths' for policy makers,"bathinda: most government schemes start with fanfare, only to leave behind a shell of ugly dreams. about 65 dalit and poor families of gill pati village in this district have learnt this over the last 20 years. about two decades ago, 64 pucca houses were constructed on the outskirts of gill pati village under union government scheme for providing houses to landless and homeless people in rural areas. after spending about rs 7.24 lakh on their construction, the district administration, in 1979, transferred their ownership to 22 harijan families, 14 carpenter, iron smith, nath and poor jatt sikh families and boriana sikh families. but since then, not one family has moved to these houses and they lie abandoned. while the windows and doors of these houses have been missing for a long time, these are now being used for dumping fodder and straw husk by the farmers of adjoining fields. partap singh, a former sarpanch of the village, said the scheme for providing houses to the weaker sections was ill-planned as these houses were constructed about 2 km out of the village,with no water, electricity, sanitation facilities or path way. the allottee families did not move into them as they were situated at a secluded place. sodha singh, darshan nath, daya ram, budha singh and jora khan, some of the 'beneficiaries', told the times of india that these houses lacked basic amenities and finding employment nearby would have been difficult. ''even 20 years after their construction, a connecting path has not been laid,'' said jora khan. partap singh said the village panchayat had repeatedly requested the district administration to dismantle the houses, dispose of material and sell the land so that the accrued money could be spent for the benefit of homeless and landless families in the village. but no steps had been taken. he said the same position prevails in the neighbouring gahiri village where none of the beneficiaries moved into the houses for lack of facilities.
