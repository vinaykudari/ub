0,125 detained for Bhiwandi clashes,"Mumbai: The Bhiwandi police on Monday recovered the body of a man who, preliminary investigations suggested, had been assaulted on the head and thrown into a river on Saturday following a clash between two groups.

The body was found in the powerloom townâ€™s Khadipar area. The police said an altercation between Akil Gaffar Shaikh (30), a rickshaw driver, and Parshuram Gharat (40), a casette shop owner, on Saturday evening led to clashes. Six persons were injured.

The police said Shaikh and Gharat, both residents of Khadipar, had been on bad terms for the past few months. However, it is not clear what the dispute between them was about.

On Saturday, the two picked a fight again, but residents presumed it was a communal riot. This led to clashes between two groups in which six powerlooms, a grocery shop, an electronics goods store, a srapyard and several houses were ransacked.

The police have detained 125 persons for the incident. Eighteen people have been charged with rioting. Gharat has been arrested, but the police refused to confirm if Shaikh had also been booked in the case.

1,Commercial taxes earning increases,"PATNA: Minister for commercial taxes Abdul Bari Siddiqui stressed that the commercial taxes revenue earnings of Bihar have been increasing at a faster rate than of many other states like New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Gujarat, Punjab, West Bengal and others.

In response to a short-notice question raised by Ashwani Kumar Choubey of the BJP in the assembly on Monday, the minister stressed that the commercial taxes collection was increasing at the rate of 15 per cent every year, which was higher than West Bengal (1 per cent), Gujarat (-3 per cent), Maharashtra (9 per cent), UP (10 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (7 per cent). He stated that the increase had taken place despite the worldwide economic slowdown and fall in collection of the Central taxes revenue. However, minister for Panchayati Raj Upendra Prasad Verma faced a stiff time in answering the question of the BJPâ€™s Prem Kumar related to murders and rapes in the state.

Conceding that on an average, nine persons were murdered and two women raped every day in Bihar, Verma stated that the police had been instructed to identify criminals and their gangs to take action against them. â€œWe have finalised our policy to give rewards for nabbing criminals,â€� he said, adding that the chief minister had stressed on quick action in cases related to atrocities against women. But the minister tried to duck the question on the special cell established at the CMâ€™s house for receiving calls related to crime. The minister said that everyone was free to approach a chief minister, ministers or MLAs for help in cases related to law and order.

Nor could the minister reply to a question by Sukhda Pandey of the BJP, who recalled that chief minister Rabri Devi had promised action against DMs and SPs of the districts where women atrocities were on the rise. â€œHow many SPs and DMs have been pulled up,â€� Pandey asked. The Speaker suggested that the subject deserved a special debate.

2,State govt ignoring physically disabled,"PATNA: The state government, in the last seven years, has failed to provide benefits to physically challenged (disabled) people in Bihar in line with the Persons With Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, normally called the PWD Act, which was passed by the Centre.

The state government made a serious move about a year back, asking all the government departments to give three per cent job reservation to the disabled people. Social welfare director Gautam Goswami, who is acting as commissioner under the Act, however, received only a small number of complaints in the two meetings held, since he assumed charge, regarding the job reservation not being given.Goswami said an awareness about the benefits of the Act is yet to be created among all concerns.

As per the Act, the reservation is to be provided prospectively in new jobs in the government. But the commissioner can act under his quasi-judicial powers only when the complaints are made. The state social welfare directorate lacks infrastructure and personnel to enforce implementation of the Act, which provides three per cent reservation in admission and jobs, both teaching and non-teaching, in educational institutions to physically challenged people. Only Patna University is making any serious move in this direction, he added.

The other provisions of the Act include three per cent reservation for funds under poverty alleviation programmes. The information regarding implementation of this provision has not reached the directorate.

The directorate, in collaboration with the Rehabilitation Council of India, an organisation run by the Union ministry of Social Justice and Company Affairs, has started rehabilitation centres in the stateâ€™s 10 districts. At least Rs 32.2 crore has been disbursed for the centres. This includes Rs 60 lakh each for the establishment of rehabilitation centres chaired by respective district magistrates in Darbhanga, Bhagalpur, Bettiah, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and some other districts, Goswami added.

This is being done under national programme for the rehabilitation of persons with physical disabilities. Under the programme, at least two community based rehabilitation workers would work at block level and two multi-purpose rehabilitation workers would work at panchayat level to generate awareness about the programme, give referral services and information about the treatment centres in the country.

3,Postcards to showcase govt achievements,"Lucknow: When it comes to publicity, even arch foes seem to bury differences, however inimical. And so, notwithstanding reports of frigid relations between chief minister Mayawati and her predecessor Rajnath Singh, the former has decided to consider an innovative proposal mooted by the latter to showcase government achievements.

The case in point is a publicity package involving purchase of two million postcards which would be used by the state government to showcase the achievements of the Mayawati government. Senior officials, while conceding that the proposal was under active consideration of the chief ministerâ€™s office, said that it would be launched in the run-up to mark celebrations of the CM completing the first 100 days in office in August, but only after the CM herself had approved the concept and design of the postcard.

â€œThe proposal appears to be good and we are in the process of looking at various aspects and their practical feasibility,â€� director and secretary, information, Rohit Nandan told Times News Network on Saturday.

The proposal was mooted by the Rajnath government in December 2001 but had to be shelved after some spade work when elections for the assembly were announced. According to a secretary to the chief minister, the state information and public relations department had already taken up the matter with the postal department and a price had also been â€œmutually acceptedâ€� for the purchase of postcards in bulk.

The blueprint of the package, a picture of Mayawati with printed slogans on the card, is being worked out. â€œAs soon as the CM approves of it we will be dispatching a draft of Rs 2 lakh as advance to the postal department,â€� said an official involved in the work.

Several slogans covering law and order, agriculture and land reforms are likely to find place on the card. The postal department has sought a printing charge of 10 paise per postcard. A list of villages which need to be focused under the new scheme is being identified. The postcards will be sent randomly to people instead of relying on sarpanchs and zila panchayats.

4,Ex-minister R G A Khan held for fraud,"Lucknow: Minister for Minority Welfare, Muslim Waqfs and Haj in the Rajnath Cabinet, Raja Ghaznaffar Ali Khan was arrested by the Co-operative Cell of the UP Police in his hometown Bijnore on Monday in connection with a case of fraud and embezzlement lodged with the Kanpur police in March 2000.

He was produced before a magistrate and handed back to the police in transit remand to be taken to Kanpur where the criminal case was registered against crime number 178 of the Naubasta police.

The FIR was lodged by the additional district co-operative officer Kripa Ram Rajput where initially 28 accused were named and identified. During the course of investigations, the name of Ghaznaffar Ali also surfaced as an accused charged with misappropriation of scholarships funds meant for students of minority community for higher studies.

IG Co-operative Cell Pyare Lal told TNN that initially, embezzlement worth Rs 2,68,84,879.60 were detected and a case registered in March 2000. During the course of investigations, more misappropriations worth another Rs 9,69,64,679 were detected. The modus operandi was to divert government money from Punjab National Bank branch in Kanpur to unauthorised banks which had their branches at Govind Nagar, Ghatampur, Sarsaul, Awas Vikas headquarters and Janta Nagar branches, said Naubasta police and then siphon it out. All the banks were co-operative banks with maximum money being taken out from the Fasal Co-operative Bank, IG Co-operative Cell Pyare Lal said adding that of the 28 accused named initially, seven had earlier been arrested before the police zeroed in on Ghaznaffar Ali on Monday.

Pakistan based militants, including United Jehad Council led by Hizbul Mujahideen supremo Syed Salahuddin, had rejected Bhat''s proposal for ceasefire and instead vowed to continue armed offensive more vigorously.

6,"Naidu, Jaitley in charge of party","NEW DELHI: Former rural development minister M Venkaiah Naidu took charge of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) here on Monday, marking a long overdue generational change in the leadership of the party organisation.

With Prime Minister A B Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and several cabinet and ministers of state present, it was evident the occasion was being used to introduce a â€˜â€˜war teamâ€™â€™ that would lead the party in the next yearâ€™s assembly elections in nine states and in the 2004 parliamentary polls as well.

Advani is slated to have a leading role in this new framework as hinted at by Naidu. In his first informal interaction with newspersons, Naidu said his â€˜â€˜requestâ€™â€™ to the Deputy Prime Minister to â€˜â€˜visit the party headquarters once or twice a week to ensure greater interaction between the party and the governmentâ€™â€™ has been accepted.

Greeting Naidu with a garland and a red bandhini safa, Vajpayee said the changes were aimed at â€˜â€˜strengthening the party and helping the government function betterâ€™â€™.

Putting the dramatic changes in perspective, Advani said the party and thegovernment have worked well, but the challenges before both at the end of four years in power demanded chintan aur vichar vimarsh (introspection and debate), which has led to parivartan (change).

He added that as a result several ministers offered to step down to â€˜â€˜serveâ€™â€™ the party.

While Naidu is yet to announce his team, he introduced former law minister Arun Jaitley as the partyâ€™s new spokesperson.

It is reported that while Sanjay Joshi will continue as organisational general secretary, the other general secretaries will be Jaitley, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh and Bal Apte.

The fifth general secretary will be either a Dalit or a woman â€” Maya Singh, who is already general secretary, may continue.

7,Chautala-farmer talks on July 5,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala on Monday revealed that he would hold talks with farmersâ€™ leaders on July 5 in connection with their demands.

The talks are being considered significant in political circles in the light of the fact that the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), which temporarily withdrew farmersâ€™ agitation on June 17 following the acceptance of some of its demands by the state government, has threatened to restart the stir if the government fails to concede its demand for a waiver for power arrears.

Incidentally, the BKU is also holding its â€˜â€˜mahapanchayatâ€™â€™ on July 4 to review the implementation of promises made by the government at the second round of talks held with finance minister Sampat Singh.

The government has already accepted farmersâ€™ demands for withdrawal of all the cases filed against BKU activists since 1992 and the compensation for the families of those killed or injured in police firing during the month-long agitation.

When told that it would be difficult for the government to completely write off the arrears, BKU supremo Ghasi Ram Nain said recently that it was for the government to find out ways and means to do this.

The farmers would not pay regular bills till the arrears were written off, he added. The government has already introduced a scheme under which if 25 per cent of the power arrears are cleared in one go, the remaining 75 per cent will be written off.

A complete waiving off of arrears at this juncture can have legal implications. It is feared that in case the government decides to write off the arrears, then those who have already cleared their arrears may challenge the decision in the court of law seeking refund.

8,All-party meet urges govt to break contractor nexus,"HYDERABAD: An all-party meeting convened here on Monday to discuss reforms in the tender process advised the government to put in place foolproof methods to break the contractor cartels.

However, the meeting endorsed most of the rec-ommendations made by a cabinet sub-committee regarding the subject. The Congress stayed away from the meeting. Roads & buildings minister T Nageswara Rao said Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president M Satyanarayana Rao had promised to send a representa-tive to the meeting but no one turned up.

Talking to reporters after the meeting, CPM leaders suggested a detailed discussion on the draft reforms. They felt the government should also work out a methodolo-gy to see that the reforms are effectively implemented.

Telangana Rashtra Samiti leader Papa Rao suggested that the government in-clude a clause for labour welfare. BJP leader S V Seshagiri Rao said land acquisition before execut-ing a project should not be entrust-ed to contractors and the sub-con-tractor system should go. He said the BJP wanted the government to permit private quality control agencies that are certified by a com-petent authority.

Minister T Nageswara Rao said introduction of e-procurement, a first-of-its-kind experiment in the country, would be introduced in three months. Under this system, the government would have the data of all the â€˜Aâ€™ class contractors, and only registered contractors would be allowed to participate in the tenders. Once the tenders were filed, the government would fi-nalise them after cross-matching them with the profiles.

With regard to land acquisition by contractors, Rao said the government would examine the prac-tices in neighbouring states before taking a final decision at the next meeting of the cabinet. He said the contractors might be permitted to acquire land only in case of small projects like roads.

The government was also considering a pro-posal where the contractors will have to specify the sub-contractors, whose names would be accepted only after proper verification. Meanwhile, the government is also considering a proposal to take a maintenance guarantee for five or eight years from the contractors.

9,No law to curb mobile use at petrol vends,"HYDERABAD: Although petroleum minister Ram Naik last week suggested that motorists switch off their mobile phones while at petrol bunks as a fire safety measure, concrete measures in this regard are still awaited.

While oil company officials say they would now put up notice boards, the fire department says it can act only after a government order is passed in this regard. The oil companies have also asked major mobile companies to educate their customers about the danger, the officials said.

The minister has said that a few fire accidents that oc-curred at petrol bunks abroad were caused by the sparks ignited by mobile phones. In his statement, Ram Naik told media per-sons the ministry had sent orders to oil companies to warn customers to switch their mobile phones off. When contacted by The Times of India, oil companies officials in the city say they could do little more than putting up signboards warning vehicle owners against using mobile phones while filling petrol. â€œSurely, we cannot have a security guard frisking customers,â€� an offi-cer with an oil company said.

Another officer too mooted the same step. â€œWe have received a note from the petroleum ministry to warn customers about the dangers of switching on mobile phones near petrol bunks. We will put up notices at our retail outlets very soon,â€� said the senior official with Bharat Petroleum. However, the tone of the notice would be that of a re-quest and not of a rule, the of-ficial said.

According to the director general of fire services Sadashiv Rao, the de-partment cannot implement any measure in this regard, for a government order was still awaited.

10,Medak by-election today,"HYDERABAD: The stage is set for the battle royal between the Telugu Desam, the Congress, and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti in the Medak by-poll which would be held on Tuesday.

The by-election was necessitated fol-lowing the death of former higher education minister Karanam Ramachandra Rao, and it had become a prestige issue for all the main parties. The three main contenders in the by-elec-tion â€” the TDP, the Congress and the Telangana Rasthra Samithi (TRS) â€” have not spared any efforts to elbow out their rivals.

The election turned prestigious as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) was fighting its first elec-tion after the recent power tariff hike. The TDP, in an attempt to garner the sympathy vote, had fielded K Uma Devi, wife of K Ramachandra Rao.

Uma is a political novice. The TDP electioneering centred around the development of the state, particularly the region, achieved during the TDP rule. On the last day of the campaign, the TDP president and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu attracted huge crowds, and the TDP leaders feel that this had made the by-election more difficult for the other two con-tenders, the Congress and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi.

The Congress, fighting the by-election on the plank of free power supply to the farm-ers, had also highlighted the lack of develop-ment and suicides of farmers and weavers during the TDP rule. The free power issue, however, turned out to be an asset for the TDP for criticising the Congress by highlighting it to the people that the scheme was not implemented in any of the 14 Congress-ruled states.

The TRS campaign, on the other hand, cen-tred around the separate Telangana plank and the injustice meted out to the region at the hands of Andhra rulers, and particularly under the TDP. All the three parties had utilised the services of their stalwarts to at-tract the people. Senior Congress leaders like party president M Satyanarayana Rao, oppo-sition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, Baga Reddy, Mallikarjun and others campaigned for the party candidate P Sashidhar Reddy.

Mirza Irshad Baig, AICC secretary (in-charge of AP), had been camping in Medak to look after the party affairs. TRS chief K Chandrasekhara Rao and Telangana Sadhana Samithi (TSS) president A Narendra have attempted to cash in on the separate Telangana sentiment. The TRS is also banking on the candidature of Pochaiah, the lone BC candidate in the fray, to garner BC votes.

From the TDP side, district in-charge minister T Devender Goud and other leaders like health minister N Janardhan Reddy, tourism minister T Srinivas Yadav, and panchayat raj minister P Srinivas Reddy campaigned on behalf of the party candidate. The constituency has about 1.70 lakh voters. The results would be declared on June 4.

16,Mamata sets conditions for joining govt,"NEW DELHI: With the Railway portfolio clearly out of reach, the Trinamul Congress has said it will not accept a ministerial berth till its demand to stall the bifurcation of Eastern Railway is met.

Trinamul leaders said on Tuesday that the party could not join the government and then wait for things to happen on their demand.

""If we get into the government and then nothing happens it will reflect badly"", said Rajya Sabha MP Dinesh Trivedi, who has been representing the party in negotiations with NDA convenor George Fernandes on the issue.

The party has also denied speculation that the government has offered Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee either the coal ministry vacated by Ram Vilas Paswan or the surface transport ministry. ""There has been no further offer"", Trinamul spokesman Sudip Bandopadhyay said, insisting that ""Mamata will not join the government unless this issue has been sorted out.""

The issue at hand is the bifurcation of the Eastern Railway and shifting the division to Bihar, a move initiated by Railway Minister Nitish Kumar recently.

The Trinamul Congress has accused Nitish, who is from Bihar, of doing this for political benefit and to the detriment of West Bengal. ""The timing was motivated with the Cabinet reshuffle in mind"", the leaders said.

Both Bandopadhyay and Trivedi pointed out that all parties in West Bengal were united in their stand on the issue, which was fast becoming a peopleâ€™s movement.

Mamata Banerjee, in her term as Railway minister, had also received such a proposal which she had turned down, the leaders said.

Political observers dismiss the Trinamul stand as Mamata Banerjeeâ€™s attempt to take the moral high ground after failing to secure the Railway berth.

But insisting that a particular ministry was not the real issue, Bandopadhyay said Mamata had been ""mentally prepared to take oath on Monday evening"" and had ""even offered to join government without a portfolio since the PM had so affectionately invited her to do so.""

At the same time she faxed a letter to the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office on the Eastern Railways issue, to which there was as yet no response. Trivedi said he had also raised the matter with Fernandes, who had assured that the Prime minister would look into it.

Fernandes, who has been the chief negotiator for the NDA, is out of town and will return to the Capital on Tuesday evening.

It would be only after his return that the next round of negotiations are likely to begin. The government has already made it clear that Nitish Kumar will not be shunted out to accommodate Mamata, who has been keen to get back the Railay portfolio to complete the projects she had begun.

The Trinamul has, of course, clarified that it will not destabilise the NDA government at the Centre on the delicate issue of Cabinet berths. ""This time we are very clear, we donâ€™t want to disturb the government. But there will also not be any compromise on our demand"", Trivedi said.

In the meantime, the Trinamul Congress is waiting for a Railways Consultative Committee meeting on Wednesday, where Bandopadhyay, who is a member, will raise the issue. ""We are hopeful that the matter will be sorted out soon. The Trinamul has no problem in joining the government once that happens,"" the Trinamul spokesman said.

17,Stalemate over Trinamul joining govt continues,"NEW DELHI: The stalemate on Trinamul Congress joining the Vajpayee government continued on Tuesday with the party saying it was still awaiting the Vajpayee government''s response to its demand for withdrawal of notification on bifurcation of Eastern Railway Zone.

""Cabinet berth is not important for us as much as it is West Bengal''s interests,"" party sources said.

Asked whether any NDA leader, including NDA convenor George Fernandes was in touch with them to sort out the tangle, they said that there had been ""no contact with anyone since last night"".

The sources said ""if and whenever the government takes a decision (on the bifurcation issue), we would like the government to make a public announcement of the same"".

There was no point in joining government ""if we cannot protect the interests of our state"", they said.

The sources, however, clarified that the party would remain in the NDA.

Trinamul has been demanding withdrawal of a government notification to bifurcate the Eastern Railway and hiving part of it to a new zone East Central railway with its headquarter in Hajipur.

18,"Tehelka, govt trade charges before panel","NEW DELHI: Tehelka Managing Director Tarun Tejpal on Tuesday charged the government with ''targetting'' the news portal both in the cross-examination and the affidavits filed before the Venkataswami Commission even as government accused the news portal of ''ethical transgression'' while undertaking the sting operation on alleged corruption in defence deals.

Pointing out that Tehelka was the only noticee to be cross-examined by the government, Tejpal, who was being questioned consecutively for the fourth day here, said the government never cared to cross-examine any of the other noticees and even never wrote a line against them in the reams of affidavits filed before the Commission.

It was a clear evidence of government''s intention of probing only Tehelka and not others against whom allegations of corruption were made, Tejpal said when questioned by Government''s counsel Additional Solicitor General Kirit N Raval.

Contesting the same and citing the actions such as Court Martial and the establishment of the Venkatswami Commission, Raval said they all are actions taken by the government to ascertain the facts.

Accusing Tehelka of ''transgression'', Raval alleged that it had violated the law of the land including Prevention of Corruption Act and Immoral Traffic Prevention Act.

Admitting that there was a ''ethical transgression'' while undertaking the sting operation, Tejpal, however, said public interest can at times take people to the wrong side of the law. Nobody can transgress the law but journalists in the public interest can do a bit, Tejpal said.

Speaking of his new ministry, Digvijay Singh said among the challenges before it was the normalisation of relations with Pakistan.

While incidents in recent times had cast a shadow of suspicion on this trust, a path had to be sought, no matter how difficult it was. India, he said, has options before it on how to deal with the issue of cross-border terrorism and would have no hesitaiton in using these options and in creating pressure on Pakistan.

Digvijay Singh''s words were the only ones emanating from the external affairs ministry on Tuesday which still awaited the senior incumbent. Jaswant Singh was still in South Block. Addressing MEA officials during the farewell given to him, the outgoing minister said Indian diplomats were second to none and Indian diplomacy had, in fact, led the debate in many areas in the last few years.

21,"Panel probing riots receives 3,100 affidavits","AHMEDABAD: Justice Nanavati and Justice Shah Commission of Inquiry into riots has received nearly 3,100 affidavits in all till Monday, the last day of testifying before the commission.

The commission, appointed in March to probe the aftermath of the Godhra incident, had started functioning from April 1 onwards and had thrice extended its deadlines to file affidavits.

""We cannot keep giving extensions ad infinitum, a time limit has to be fixed. Besides the commission''s term will end on December 5, so we have to carry out the exercise of the inquiry expeditiously"" said Justice KG Shah.

Talking to the TNN, Justice Shah stressed on maintaining a time limit for completion of inquiry ''keeping in mind the spirit of the Commission of Inquiry Act''.

He said the commission was keen on starting the inquiry at the earliest. The commission has given final shape to the Inquiry Procedure Rules for conducting the inquiry.

It has decided to allow inspection of records in its office or obtaining copies of its orders at nominal payment at mutually convenient time. An application will have to be made to the commission secretary in advance.

The commission appointed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act was free to evolve its own procedure for inquiry which will lead to preparation and submission of its report.

The commission has decided that it will ordinarily receive evidence on affidavits only. However, it might permit such persons to supplement their evidence by deposing orally and subjecting to cross-examination. Besides, the commission will not allow anyone to be represented by a legal practitioner or to cross-examine a witness or any person whose evidence is recorded by the commission, except for legal provisions.

But this will be allowed in cases where commission finds it useful for the purpose of the inquiry. Applications made before the commission may be disposed of by it without an oral hearing.

The commission has laid it down that no person shall have a right to be heard except as provided by Act and the rules or when permitted by the Commission. But, the Commission will have the rights to call any person filing affidavits for examination or cross-examination.

The witnesses being summoned before the commission will be paid travelling allowance on a daily allowances as is being paid to a witness in a civil courts.

Accompanied by Urban Development department officials, Shivakumar went around the office in Visvesvaraya Towers around noon and found that some of the staff were ``on a coffee break.'''' He went through the files and sought an explanation on the reasons for them being kept pending.

Shivakumar told The Times of India that the slackness of the directorate had resulted in the Centre and state governments slashing the budgetary allocation. ``The state finance department has earmarked Rs 50 lakh as against Rs 1 crore in the budget as the funds were not used. Likewise Rs 1 crore allocated by the Centre for solid waste management has not been utilised. I plan to bring some drastic changes in the functioning of the system,'''' he added.

24,"Gastro cases in Capital increase by 3,000","NEW DELHI: Monsoon has not yet arrived and the city has already recorded 36,000 cases of gastroenteritis this season. The number is much higher than this time last year when 33,000 cases were reported.

The city health ministry swung into action, and as a first step health minister A K Walia suspended three Delhi Jal Board employees who were found negligent in providing safe drinking water.

The suspended employees had failed to keep functional a chlorinator attached to a tubewell in Kanganheri village, west Delhi. An official said, â€˜â€˜The water from the tubewell would have been automatically chlorinated otherwise.â€™â€™

Over the past one week, more than 55 gastroenteritis cases have been reported from Kanganheri village. Walia said, â€˜â€˜We had told senior engineers to ensure proper functioning of chlorinators. A month ago, we had got written statements from all zones that their chlorinators were working.â€™â€™

He said, â€˜â€˜It was a clear case of negligence. We were given a wrong report as the chlorinator at Kanganheri had not been working for a long time.â€™â€™

About a fortnight ago, the main pipeline supplying DJB water to the village burst. As a result village residents were completely dependent on water from the tubewell. And since the chlorinator did not work, a large number contracted gastroenteritis.â€™â€™

Walia hoped that the three suspensions would send a clear message to all employees responsible for supplying potable water. â€˜â€˜They will now know that we are serious,â€™â€™ he said.

He said, â€˜â€˜One or two people falling ill in an area is not a big issue. But when one colony reports a large number of cases, it can only happen because of neglect by the civic agencies and I have to take action.â€™â€™

About this yearâ€™s figures, Walia said, â€˜â€˜The rise is not alarming. Having visited slums and resettlement colonies, I realise that these diseases also have a lot to do with personal habits and hygiene.â€™â€™

In a meeting with civic officials on Tuesday, Walia asked them to furnish a list of all areas in which proper sanitation work was not being carried out. He also asked for a list of drains that had been encroached upon.

â€˜â€˜Once I get both the lists, I would be able to initiate action against the employees concerned,â€™â€™ he said.

25,Expelled BJP MLAs support govt,"BANGALORE: Eight expelled BJP legislators, accompanied by a party legislator, called on Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Tuesday and offered ``issue-based'''' support to the government in return for grants for developmental work in their constituencies.

The nine legislators, including Belur MLA S.H. Puttaranganath, met twice to discuss whether they should sit as a separate group in the Assembly or join the Congress. However, the meetings were inconclusive, though legislators said they were not ruling out joining the Congress at a later date.

``We were advised by senior ministers Mallikarjun M. Kharge, H.C. Srikantaiah, K.H. Ranganth and Dharam Singh to meet Krishna. In their presence, we told him about problems in our constituencies and he has promised to help us. The issue of our joining Congress was not discussed,'''' legislator N.L. Bharatishankar said.

Six of the eight legislators __ Krishnappa, V. Papanna, C. Guruswamy, M.S. Shankarlinge Gowda, H.C. Basavaraju and Gundappa Vakil __ were expelled after they cross-voted for independent candidate Vijay Mallya in the recent Rajya Sabha elections. The other two __ Bharatishankar and A. Manju __ were expelled earlier after they signed Mallya''s nomination papers.

26,Why children of crime busters break the law,"NEW DELHI: A policewomanâ€™s son and his friends abducted a woman in her car in Vasant Vihar. He dumped the woman near Rajouri Garden and escaped with her car, mobile phone and cash.

A Moti Nagar-based sports goods shop owner refused to offer rebate to a policemanâ€™s son. Later, the boy along with members of his cricket club, started threatening the shop owner and tried to extort cricket kits for his team.

An east Delhi policemanâ€™s son bought a locally made weapon from a criminal and shot dead a woman after taking her to a picnic hut in Surajkund. He wanted to get rid of the woman whom he had earlier promised to marry.

The number of children of wardens of law taking to crime is alarmingly on the rise. The fact that their parents are employed with the Delhi Police seems to egg them on rather than deter them from crime.

Policemen squarely blame it on their job which often keeps them away from their children. â€˜â€˜At times, we donâ€™t get home in days. This affects discipline at home,â€™â€™ said a constable. â€˜â€˜This anomaly in the upbringing of policemenâ€™s children, where there is lack of bonding between the child and his father, increases scope for delinquency,â€™â€™ said senior consultant psychiatrist, Sanjay Chugh.

A woman police constable, posted in a police station in south Delhi, said parents become over indulgent because they have very little time for their children. â€˜â€˜This spoils the child as parents try to make up for lost time by fulfilling all his wishes,â€™â€™ she said. Dipanker Gupta, a sociologist with Jawaharlal Nehru University, said children of policemen were often influenced by the power their parents wielded. â€˜â€˜If you are powerful, you tend to demonstrate that law is of no consequence to you,â€™â€™ said Gupta. This was the case in all walks of life, he said.

According to Chugh, a policemanâ€™s child is also exposed to small doses of violence. â€˜â€˜This kills his natural aversion to violence. If ever he has to decide whether to turn violent or not, he has no hesitation in turning violent,â€™â€™ he said.

Poor education does further damage. â€˜â€˜The Delhi Police is yet to assure good quality free education for our children. Not all of us can afford to send our children to good public schools,â€™â€™ said a constable. â€˜â€˜As a result, our children fail to find good jobs and often end up in bad company,â€™â€™ he said.

â€˜â€˜None of us want our children to join the police. Given a choice, we would want them to join only at a gazetted officerâ€™s post so that they can take good care of their children,â€™â€™ said another the constable.

27,SSB indulging in petty crimes: Building minister,"KISHANGANJ: Building Construction Minister Mohd Taslimuddin said here on Tuesday that the Bihar police and the Special Security Bureau (SSB) jawans, instead of working in tandem in curbing trans-border crimes in this district, were rather trying to poach upon each other''s area of functioning, albeit for wrong reasons like exploiting the generally innocent but gullible people and providing cover for petty crimes.

Talking to mediapersons here, Taslimuddin said that when the SSB was deputed in the district in the wake of Maoist insurgency and upheaval in neighbouring Nepal, it was fervently hoped that they would crack their whip on insurgents and criminals thriving on trans-border crimes. But, they all appeared to behave like ordinary cops indulging in petty crimes, he regretted.

Taslimuddin said it was nothing short of an irony that though there was no dearth of schools in the district, it continued to suffer the stigma of having the lowest literacy level in the country. He also stressed the need for the public to agitate against ""absenteeism"" on the part of teachers.
