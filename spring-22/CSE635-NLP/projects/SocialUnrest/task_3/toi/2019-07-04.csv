0,New channel to increase water supply,"NEW DELHI: After years of delay, the construction of a parallel water conduit from Munak to Haidarpur may finally begin from next month.

Being funded by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and constructed by the Haryana state government, this parallel raw water channel would augment the cityâ€™s existing water supply by about 80 million gallons per day.

DJB chief P K Tripathi said the Delhi state government has already paid Rs 25 crore in advance to the Haryana state government to start work on the parallel water channel. The Haryana government has floated tenders to award work for this Rs 380-crore project.

This 102-km conduit would carry raw water from the Yamuna flowing in Haryana to Delhi. The existing channel gets about 300 quesecs of water which is made potable in treatment plants in Delhi.

Tripathi said as the existing channel is not properly lined, almost 30 per cent of water carried from Haryana to Delhi is lost in seepage. â€˜â€˜If a parallel channel is built, nearly 80 MGD water can be saved for Delhi,â€™â€™ he said.

The Haryana government had earlier promised to complete the project in three years. The deadline was later brought down to two years. â€˜â€˜We have given the Haryana government three years to put the parallel channel in place,â€™â€™ Tripathi said.

On Wednesday, Delhi state government chief minister Sheila Dikshit launched the DJBâ€™s official website. Application forms for a new water connection, regularisation of unauthorised connection and water meter testing can be downloaded from this bilingual website.

1,Students bear brunt as parties clash,"MYSORE: Even as Congress and Janata Dal members in the district fight a war of nerves, thousands of children and their teachers are left pondering what their school timings will finally be.

It''s been a month since the first term got over, still, there is uncertainity. Managements of schools do not know whether they have to follow the present timings (9.20 a.m. to 4.40 p.m.) or they have to change to the new timings, (10.10 a.m. to 4.50 p.m.)

Last year, when Vishwanath (then Education minister) introduced the new timings, there was discontent among teachers. The government however left it to the discretion of the Zilla Panchayats to handle the issue.

A majority of Zilla Panchyats controlled by the Congress opposed the new timings and stuck to the old one (10.10 a.m. to 4.50 p.m.). Members in Mysore ZP, that are dominated by JD(S) also opposed the new timings. However, a lack of majority in the council where MLAs, MLCs , MPs and Taluk Panchayat presidents have voting rights, prevented the JD(S) from opposing the government''s direction.

In a meeting held in June this year, ZP chief Vanajakshi brought up the issue for discussion. Congress members caught unawares, boycotted the meeting and JD(S) members passed the resolution (of resorting to old timings) by a voice vote.

But, there''s a hitch. Vishwanath has apparently directed officials not to implement the ZP resolution. And he''s not alone. The minister''s being backed by Congress members who are pressurising him not to give effect to the order, sources added.

ZP officials said there is a procedural lacuna in the resolution and this has prevented the CEO from implementing it. They feel, any policy decision should be implemented only after a discussion on the subject.

An official source said, ""This issue was not on the agenda when the meeting took place. And, it cannot be implemented without seeking the government''s clarification.""

On the allegation made by the JD(S) that Vishwanath is pressuring the CEO not to implement the resolution, the source refused to divulge details.

As for the JD (S), they are determined to go ahead with the resolution what with their party gaining a majority in the council. Of seven taluk panchayats, they have control over six.

""If the government fails to implement the resolution, we will bring it up again before the general body and ensure it is passed"" Vanajakshi the ZP chief said.

Whatever both sides claim, one thing is clear. The issue has become a matter of prestige for the Congress and the JD (S). Irrespective of who finally wins, the brunt will fall on the schools.

2,"Recruitment policy rollback may cost 32,000 jobs","LUCKNOW: With the BJP and other allies failing to draft a common minimum programme, chief minister Mayawati is having a field day. One after another, she is reversing decisions of her predecessor Rajnath Singh to carry on with her Dalit agenda. First it was quota-within-quota and now reversal of Rajnathâ€™s policy for decentralisation of recruitment process in government services. Fate of 32,000 job-seekers in Uttar Pradesh may hang in balance following Mayawatiâ€™s decision to roll back Rajnathâ€™s recruitment policy.

Significantly, the issue which had rocked her the last cabinet meeting got clearance without much resistance from the BJP and other allies. A part of her Dalit agenda, the move will help her government clear quota backlog and regularise ad hoc appointments till 1998, a long pending demand of state employees. But the decision may mar the prospects of general candidates who had taken Group C examination, one of the biggest selection exercises in the country involving over 15 lakh candidates, and other examinations for primary and secondary teachers.

During the Rajnath Singh tenure, the government had advertised for about 32,000 posts in Group C, BTC and state police services. Powers for appointments were withdrawn from departmental heads and the process was decentralised for free and fair selection through district and HoD committees.

A record 9 lakh applications were received for 3,000 posts to be filled through district selection committees while 5 lakh applicants had applied for 5,000 posts.

Accordingly, examinations were held in July-August 2001 and those selected were called for interview. But, before the appointment letters were issued the recruitment drive was stalled following a stay from the Supreme Court.

Now the Mayawati government has cleared the deck for recruitment of Dalits and backwards on vacancies in government departments. Since the case is pending in the court of law, she is using the â€˜back doorâ€™ to make recruitments.

The government has issued directives to fill up quota backlog till date and regularise ad hoc appointments till 1998. Orders have also been issued not to hold any fresh examinations but make direct recruitments on the vacant posts for these two categories. Powers of departmental heads and HCNs have been restored to make the appointments at the earliest. There will be hardly any seats left for candidates already selected after this exercise. Clearly, it will mar the future of about 32,000 candidates who were selected during the previous regime.

3,Govt going about industrial policy in right earnest,"Lucknow: Chief minister Mayawati is going about the implementation of her new industrial policy in the right earnest.

To begin with, Kanpur has been added to the list of special economic zones (SEZ) that are being created to speed up the process of industrialisation in the state. The other two SEZs are being established at Noida (Taj SEZ) and Varanasi. The process to acquire land in the three SEZs has begun. Rs 150 crore has been earmarked for acquiring 5000 hectare of land for the Taj SEZ which would cover Noida, Greater Noida and Agra.

Another Rs 20 crore has been earmarked for the Kanpur SEZ for which 1000 hectare land is being acquired. The Kanpur SEZ would lie between Unnao and Kanpur (near the Ganga bridge) and would cover some of the existing industrial area besides the area that lies with the UPSIDC.

For the Varanasi SEZ, process to acquire 500 hectare of land has begun. The sum allocated for the purpose is Rs 10 crore.

To ensure that the decisions are not changed with the change in regime, the government is expected to come out with an ordinance on the three SEZs within a week. What makes this policy different from others is the single window system and the decisions on power plants. It also extends to the CMâ€™s complete trust in her senior most principal secretary, Shashank Shekhar Singh, who is not just the industrial development commissioner but also the chairman of Noida and Greater Noida. Despite her trust, the CM would personally monitor and review the progress.

Perhaps for the first time, trade tax and environmental pollution-related issues for the SEZ will be handled by the IDC and the entrepreneur will not have to run to the departments concerned for clearance. In the case of power, although the Noida experiment had failed and the private investor there had burnt his fingers, sources point out that this time investors putting up a power plant would not be dealing with the state electricity board, as was the case in Noida. All that would be needed is an approval by the UP Power Corporation Limited and the State Electricity Regulatory Commission. An entrepreneur, however, commented that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. â€œAs a policy, it is definitely very entrepreneur-friendly but weâ€™ll have to wait and see what one has to go through when it comes to implementation.â€� Mayawati has very little time, so she may try and do something in double quick time, he said wistfully.

4,Panel to probe suicide attempt by girls,"PATNA: The state government has set up a committee to probe the attempt of the two girl students of a private dental college to commit suicide. The committee is to table a detailed report in the House on Thursday.

This was stated by medical education minister Shakeel Ahmad in the assembly on Wednesday, even as the government came in for severe criticism for failing to take action against the management of the dental college. Ahmad stated that the government had no control over the private dental college as the government had not given recognition to it.

â€œHowever, with this development it becomes a matter of law and order,â€� the minister said, pointing out that he had personally visited the two girls admitted in Patna Medical College Hospital on Wednesday morning. He said that they were out of danger.

BJP MLA Bhola Prasad Singh took strong exception to the ministerâ€™s reply, and insisted that any institution running in Bihar had to follow the rules and regulations of the state. However, the minister stuck to his stand, insisting that the private dental college was an autonomous institution under the provisions of the Constitution, and that the state had no say in its functioning.

While Speaker expressed concern over the development, leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi charged that the secretary of the institute, T R Rai, had strong links with members of the ruling party and was allowed to function like a dictator. Modi recalled that 10 days ago, there were reports of the students not being allowed to leave the instituteâ€™s premises.

5,HC orders govt to file report on state schools,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Wednesday directed additional advocate general S K Ghosh to file a detailed report to the court explaining the steps taken by the state government to ameliorate the condition of the primary and secondary schools of the urban areas in the Patna district.

Fixing July 10 as the next date of hearing on the matter, the division bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice R S Dhavan and Justice R N Prasad, observed that the bench was interested in the â€œresultsâ€� of the steps taken by the state government in the light of the courtâ€™s order of May 2 passed by the bench of the Chief Justice and Justice S K Singh.

â€œIt is not interested in the future planning of the state government,â€� the Chief Justice observed.

In its May 2 order, the high court had stated: â€œAlmost Rs 100 crore, meant for the plan allocation for the primary and secondary schools, lapsed in the last 20 years.

â€œThe state government pull up its socks and get into the exercise of budgetary planning and further executing the plans on this subject.

Both factors when not resorted to. It affects the people and consequently the high court, because it is saddled with litigations, which it could avoid, but cannot.â€�

â€œThe court will now expect a report of the systematic manner in which remedial steps will be undertaken to repair and resurrect the schools, so that they are available to the children as a part of the public plan, which, in any case, is obligation of the state.

But now there is no time to grant long adjournments, as keeping the schools in good repair and functional is the normalcy of the situation. Sitting back and letting jungle weeds and cobwebs grow in schools is an abnormality, a disease to be shed,â€� the high courtâ€™s May 2 order had said.

The reports of about 54 neglected primary and secondary schools of Patna had been placed before the bench at that time.

Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, lawyer M P Gupta said that despite spending of Rs 100 crore in the last 20 years, there in no improvement in the condition of 100 primary and secondary schools of the Patna urban areas, as reported in a local daily, while the state government has surrendered about Rs 100 crore to the Centre in last 20 years.

6,Vaiko dares Jaya to arrest him,"CHENNAI: MDMK chief and NDA partner Vaiko has challenged chief minister J Jayalalithaa to take action against him.

His reply came after Jayalalithaaâ€™s threatened on Tuesday to arrest Vaiko under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) for supporting the LTTE. In a letter to deputy prime minister L.K. Advani, asking the Centre to take action against Vaiko, Jayalalithaa had said: â€˜â€˜We have no other option but to proceed against the individual both under POTA and under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and to arrest the individual who has blatantly spoken in support of the terrorist outfit in total disregard and defiance of the laws of the land.â€™â€™

However, Vaiko in a statement faxed from Chicago on Wednesday challenged Jayalalithaa to take action against him, saying he would not be cowed down by such threats. â€˜â€˜My party has never indulged in violence. The state government will never succeed in its efforts to threaten the MDMK with POTA,â€™â€™ he said in his statement.

Quoting Vaikoâ€™s speech at a public meeting in Thirumangalam near Madurai on June 29, Jayalalithaa in her letter had pointed out that his speech â€˜â€˜undoubtedly attracts the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, as also POTAâ€™â€™.

She had quoted Vaiko as saying, â€˜â€˜Yesterday I supported the LTTE. Even today I am supporting the LTTE. Even tomorrow I will continue to support the LTTE. I am not afraid of POTA. I have faced even more draconian laws than POTA.â€™â€™

Jayalalithaa had observed that if such provocative â€˜â€˜outburstsâ€™â€™ were not dealt with an â€˜â€˜iron handâ€™â€™, fundamentalist groups like SIMI and Al-Qaida would be â€˜â€˜emboldenedâ€™â€™. She also sent video clippings of the public meeting along with her letter to Advani.

Terming Vaikoâ€™s statements as â€˜â€˜shockingâ€™â€™, she said: â€˜â€˜Vaiko has now openly defied POTA, thereby questioning and challenging the very authority of the Government of India. This amounts to a volte- face on the part of Vaiko who heads a party which is a constituent of the NDA coalition government at the Centre with its members serving as cabinet ministers.â€™â€™

But Vaiko in his statement on Wednesday pointed out that he had not said anything at his public meetings, including the one at Thirumangalam, that would disturb peace and, therefore, attract provisions of POTA.

â€˜â€˜The nation knows how the AIADMK uses power and machinery to suppress the democratic rights of its opposition and that she is using POTA only to threaten me,â€™â€™ Vaiko said and added when the NDA government brought about POTA to protect democracy, the CM was using it as a weapon against her political opponents.

Vaiko said he would cut short his visit to the US by two days and return on July 12. He had left for the US on June 30.

7,"Naxals, govt told to maintain restraint","Hyderabad: The Congress on Wednesday appealed to the Peopleâ€™s War and the government to observe restraint in the light of Tuesdayâ€™s encounter in Karimnagar.

Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president M Satyanarayana Rao told reporters on Wednesday that it was unfortunate that an encounter took place in the midst of the ongoing talks between the government and the naxalites. Agreeing with the opinion of chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on arms struggle, Rao said that the PW ideology to use arms for achieving social justice was unacceptable.

Referring to Tuesdayâ€™s encounter, he said both the parties should ensure that the talks were not derailed as the people wanted peace. He expressed the apprehension that a conducive atmosphere created for the conduct of talks had been disturbed with the encounter.

The Committee of Concerned Citizens (CCC) has strongly condemned the encounter in Karimnagar district on Tuesday in which four members of the Peopleâ€™s War, including senior leader Padmakka, were shot dead by the police. The committee asked the government to stop such encounters to keep the talks going.

In a press release on Wednesday, CCC convener S R Sankaran appealed to political parties and all sections of society to prevail on the government to adopt a democratic approach to the resolution of peopleâ€™s problems. He said the talks between the government and the Peopleâ€™s War had raised the expectations of the people that peace would dawn soon. â€œBut these encounters have come as a setback to such hopes,â€� Sankaran said.

â€œThe CCC feels that while there was no loss of life caused by the Peopleâ€™s War in recent times, the overall situation has primarily deteriorated due to the encounter killings which have continued as a state policy,â€� Sankaran said. The CPI-ML (New Democracy) also condemned the encounter and demanded an inquiry into the killing by a high court judge.

Describing it as a â€œfake encounterâ€�, the partyâ€™s state secretary Rayala Subash Chandra Bose said in a press release that the police had killed the naxalites although they could have arrested them.

In another press release, the CPM state secretary B V Raghavulu urged the government to create a conducive atmosphere for dialogue with the Peopleâ€™s War naxalites.

8,Students protest delay in issuing marksheets,"VADODARA: M S University''s faculty of commerce students sent a delegation of their leaders to the university vice-chancellor to protest against the delay in issuing marksheets despite the results being out a few days ago.

Faculty general secretary Rutwik Joshi said the students of final year commerce have encountered problems when applying to universities in other state and even within the MSU as the application forms have to be accompanied with mark sheets.

""The MSU''s exam section has delayed giving the marksheets despite the results being declared. This is causing us a lot of problems, as many of us have to apply to other university for further studies,"" they said. The V-C said he was not aware that the marksheets were not yet dispatched.

""He said he would look into the matter and speak to the university registrar and exam in charge,"" said Joshi. He added that the students have also asked for speedy decision on the inquiry about the ''theft'' of seven answer supplements of some students in the recent exam held at the experimental school.

9,Gujarat elections unlikely before Jan,"AHMEDABAD : Contrary to popular perception, the elections to the Gujarat Assembly may be held only in January or February next year. Although Chief Minister Narendra Modi prefers early elections, the Election Commission is not quite amenable to the idea, say highly placed sources.""The question is what is the need for advancing the date of elections by a few months, the Election Commission might ask and to that question we have no answer. After all, the government in Gandhinagar has a solid majority and is in no imminent danger of falling,"" concedes a BJP leader. The term of the present Assembly will end in March.In the last few weeks there had been talk of holding the assembly elections in October, just after the poll in Jammu and Kashmir. Speculation had also been rife that after the presidential elections in the middle of July, Modi would recommend dissolution of the Assembly and ask for a mandate from the people. The Gujarat 'Gaurav Yatra', that has now been put off, was conceived as a programme to kick-start the election campaign. "" I understand that Modi is now convinced that he has to give up plans for early elections and therefore his strategy will now be to hold on to his job till the last day that he can,"" a senior party MLA told 'The Times of India'. A session of the Assembly is believed to be requisitioned for the end of July and this would obviate the need for holding another session till the beginning of January. A gap of six months between two sessions of the Assembly is allowed as per legislative practice.All this comes as Modi's predecessor Keshubhai Patel has resisted moving to Delhi as a central minister, indicating his interest in state politics. Even without Keshubhai dissidence seems to be rearing its head once again in the state BJP. Though Modi wants to replace party general secretary Nalin Bhatt and vice-president Suresh Gandhi, state party chief Rajendrasinh Rana will have nothing of this. These developments have come to light even as it becomes clear that the perceived polarisation of votes in the state is actually restricted to Ahmedabad and a few urban centres. In the rest of the state, it is the same old caste politics that is at play.""Thus, the perceived gain to the BJP is largely illusory and the only two factors that would help them are the beginnings of a good monsoon and the fact that the Congress is in disarray,"" says an analyst. Though the main opposition party, the Congress is showing no signs of getting its act together. *Though Modi prefers early elections, the Election Commission is not amenable to the idea * Gujarat 'Gaurav Yatra', that has been put off, was conceived as a programme to kick-start campaigning * Perceived polarisation of votes actually restricted to Ahmedabad and few urban centres; elsewhere it's the same old caste politics at play.

10,Jain attacked for role in riot cases: FIR,"VADODARA: While the city remained tense following the firing on BJP leader Neeraj Jain, the FIR filed in the incident alleged that he was shot at because of his role he played in obtaining bails for accused in riot cases. No arrests have, however, been made so far.

According to sources, Jain had been working intensively for pleading cases of those accused of rioting. He was on a group of advocates that was formed for the purpose.

Jain''s friend and Bajrang Dal worker, Ketan Thakkar, has alleged that accused might have hatched a conspiracy to kill Jain. Thakkar has said the shot was fired from a distance of about five feet. While he was unable to see the assailants or the registration number of the bike, he has stated that the accused were about 28 to 30 years old.

The city police, meanwhile, is yet to make any significant breakthrough in the case. They said it seemed that the attack was the handiwork of professionals. However, they added, there were few clews in that regard.

""The modus operandi, though, definitely indicates that professionals may have been involved. The way they conducted the ''operation'' in a busy hour and escaped indicates this,"" one official said.

Jain is, however, yet to give any statement to the police. Officers said there was severe damage to organs in his neck, and hence he was not in a position to speak. ""Doctors have advised him against this, and we will have to wait for his statement,"" police said.

Doctors attending on Jain, meanwhile, said the bullet that hit him was still embedded in his shoulder. A CT-scan of the injured parts will be conducted soon. If required, an operation will be conducted on Jain within the next couple of days.

The city police is learnt to have offered security to a couple of prominent BJP leaders in the city following the firing incident. Prominent BJP leader Ajay Dave said he had received an offer in this regard, but turned it down.

""Security would hamper my movements and become a burden. Instead, I have asked the police to intensify patrolling in my residential areas,"" Dave said.

Baroda Bar Association, in a sharp reaction to the incident, has given a two-day strike call. A release issued here by association president Narendra Tiwari came down heavily on the city police stating that it was unable to prevent untoward incidents even in a busy area like Nyay Mandir despite the fact that several policemen were present there.

11,Rural riot victims reluctant to go home,"AHMEDABAD: Riot victims in the cities of Gujarat may find a way of putting the recent communal violence behind them and start lives afresh. But many from the rural areas are still reluctant to go home. Having escaped death by hairbreadth once, they are not ready to take any chances. If they do go back, it will only be after the July 12 Rathyatra, when trouble is expected. According to one estimate, nearly 50 per cent of the rural victims are simply too scared to go home.

The Sarvajanik Public Charitable Trust at Balasinor alone is taking care of about 110 families at Virpur, who have refused to go back. The Trust has taken responsibility of about 384 families of 45 villages who are waiting for July 12 to pass by without any violent incidents.

""We have even provided them with tin sheets to rebuild their broken homes,"" says Abdul Rashid Shaikh of the trust, ""but they are not ready to budge until the Rathyatra passes off peacefully.""

There are scores of villages in Kheda as well, where minority community members simply refuse to return and bring their lives back to normal. Because of the unprecedented scale of the violence, families prefer to live out in the open, near closed relief camps, rather than live in their villages in fear.

""On the whole, victims have refused to go back to Patel-dominated villages,"" says Martin Macwan of Navsarjan, which has taken the lead in helping villagers where they have gathered the courage to go back. ""In Kheda, the Patels are a major political force, which the victims directly associate with the VHP.""

According to Macwan, victims have gone back to villages where Muslims are in large numbers or where Congress politicians have a say. Sabli village in Sabarkantha has 90 per cent Ghanchi Muslims. Their community members from the surrounding areas have bought land here and settled down. But even here, there are 47 families of economically backward Muslims living in tents, who have refused to go back to their villages.

The tribal belt of the state, on the other hand, has its own set of problems. ""Pandervada, Anjanvav and Delol are all villages in which there was large-scale violence and more than 30 people were killed,"" says Sejal Dand of Anndi NGO, co-ordinating for camps in the area. ""The residents have nothing to go back to as their homes have been razed, apart from the fact that they are scared. With cash dole of Rs 5,000 and Rs 7,000, there is no way they can reconstruct their homes. They must have spent all the money in the camp itself.""

Director of Prashant, father Cedric Prakash believes rehabilitation in the tribal belt will be especially difficult. ""Tribals and Muslims have always had a special relationship, a bond,"" he says. ""For instance, if a tribal decides to get his daughter married, the Muslim, normally a shopkeeper, will be the first to lend him money and even help out in the preparations. That bond has been broken know. The tribal will find it difficult to face the Muslim, and the Muslim will have no trust.""

However, the one deadline that the victims are hoping will pass peacefully, is the Rathyatra. If the day passes off peacefully many of them may gather the courage to go back.

14,Ulfa forms women suicide squads,"GUWAHATI: The United Liberation Front of Asom is set to create a history of sorts, preparing to become the first rebel group from the Northeast to form an all-women suicide squad very soon.Police sources here on Thursday confirmed that between forty and fifty of female cadres belonging to the banned outfit are undergoing their final phase of training in an Ulfa training camp located in the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.""The training module developed for the lady guerrillas centres around handling explosives. This apart, they will also be imparted training in an assortment of weapons, besides being made to undergo rigorous physical training to make them tough"", the police sources commented.The outfit, it may be mentioned, is estimated to have a total strength of as many as twelve hundred cadres in its army, headed by the all-powerful commander-in-chief, Paresh Barua. All the suicide squad members have reportedly been drawn from among the women cadres of its army. According to the sources, the all-women suicide squad had been planned by Ulfa strategists for quite some time now. However, it took a long time to concretise because of the unwillingness of women rebels within the outfit to volunteer for such a high-risk assignment.""Without the motivation and all-out personal efforts by Kaveri Kachari Rajkhowa, the wife of Ulfa Chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and the outfit's cultural secretary, Pranati Deka, the suicide squad would never have been born. As per our reports, the rebels from this squad would be utilised for specific assignments like targeting VVIPS and so on"", the police sources informed.Security experts feel that the formation of the suicide squad is a ""last-ditch"" effort by the banned outfit - facing the heat after being inflicted with major casualties like that of its top leader Tapan Baruah - to boost its sagging morale. ""The outfit is bogged down with many problems. Desertions from its ranks have reached an all-time high, so much so that Ulfa cadres are being disallowed to come down from its Bhutan camps to Assam for minor medical treatment in the fear they will not return"", a top police official commented.

17,SSC passing marks to be increased to 40%,"AHMEDABAD: If the low 56.92 per cent SSC result this year has left students in a tizzy, cracking the class 10 board exams could become a more difficult proposition next year. For the Gujarat Secondary Education Board (GSEB) has finally decided to hike the passing marks from 35 to 40!

The GSEB had been contemplating to implement this decision for the past two years with the objective to improving the quality of education. But with Gujarat reeling under natural and man-made disasters it was kept at bay.

Passing marks were not raised in SSC exams held in 2002 as students became candidates of sympathy because of the communal violence.

""With the quake and riots behind us, the GSEB has finally decided to hike passing marks to 40 in SSC exams to be held in March 2003"", confirmed director of examination of GSEB Hasmukh Hingu. Subsequently, 40 marks passing will be extended to class 11 and class 12 in years 2004 and 2005 respectively.

""The GSEB has had 35 marks passing since years immemorial. It is high time the passing marks were hiked so as to make the students put in hard work"", says Hingu.

Educationists across the state have welcomed the decision as imperative and much-needed in view of increasing competition and rising standards of education in other states in the country.

""Increasing the passing marks will yield positive results as students will be required to put in extra hard work. It was high time some changed were effected to bolster the quality of education in state"", says KC Patel, principal of Sheth CN Vidyalaya School.

Some, however, felt that the decision will affect students who were in 8th and 9th class in 2001 and 2002 respectively and will appear in the board exams this year and the next. ""These are the students who were mass promoted because of earthquake and marked leniently in 2002 because of the riots. The task of scoring 40 pass marks might become difficult for such students. It would be prudent if board implements this decision two years later"", conceded DM Patel, principal of Diwan Ballubhai Higher Secondary School, Paldi.

19,‘Why has ex-secy not been arrested?’,"PATIALA: Why has the Vigilance Bureau (VB) not arrested the former secretary of the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) Pritpal Singh despite his name figuring in the FIR registered by the VB?

This question was raised by Gurpal Singh, a professor in the law department of the Punjabi University, while talking to media persons in the court complex here on Thursday.

He said that the VB was harassing the innocent persons while allowing the accused to go scot free.

He said that Pritpal Singh had on several occasions asked them to follow the â€œkey of answersâ€� while checking answer scripts.

That the efforts were being made to sideline the basic issue was clear from the fact that the Vigilance Bureau was concentrating on the appointment of PCS (judicial) but not taking any concrete step against the persons selected under PCS (executive) category, who had already been removed from their posts, he added.

Since he was not toeing the line of the investigating agency, the Vigilance Bureau arrested him.

He and his wife together earned around Rs 64,000 as salaries and paid Rs 2 lakh as income tax.

If he had made any amount in any illegal way, the VB should prove it, he challenged.

Speaking on setting question papers, he said that he had never set any paper except once in 1991, though he had been regularly checking papers since 1989.
