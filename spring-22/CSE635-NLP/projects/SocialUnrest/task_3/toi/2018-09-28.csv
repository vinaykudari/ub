""we had a target of 74.54 lakh tons but we now estimate that the production will be around 48.53 lakh tons,"" he stated. referring to the seeds position, jayachandra said: ""due to the failure, we expect many people to shift to rabi crops and are making arrangements to fulfil the needs of farmers. subsidy for seeds of all crops will be given only for certified seeds."" jayachandra said about rs 1.4 crore had been released for the purpose and would be channelled through the karnataka state seeds corporation and national seeds corporation. seeds procured from some private companies would also be made available through these two bodies, he said. meanwhile, despite the fall in production jayachandra said the prices had not gone up which had prompted the government to step in and begin procurement. ""we have asked the deputy commissioners in the districts to review arrival of produce and the prevailing rates. wherever the prices are below the msp, the officers have been asked to procure the foodgrains,"" he stated. in addition, the government has also increased the msp for the entire range of foodgrains as well as soya beans, sunflower and cotton. on the rainfall situation, he said the monsoon was active over a large part of the state except the coastal districts and the state had received an average of 692 mm of rainfall as against a normal of 765 mm, indicating a 10 per cent shortage.

3,DF govt rejects charges on drought relief,"mumbai: dismissing as baseless the centre's allegations that the state government had underutilised funds meant for calamity relief and failed to lift food stocks under the food-for-work scheme, state ministers on tuesday launched a verbal offensive against the centre. ganpatrao deshmukh, minister for employment guarantee schemes which implement the centre's food-for-work scheme in the state, said the allegation that the state had failed to lift food stocks was not based on facts.""the centre released only up to 10,000 metric tonnes till march 2001 when the demand was much higher. the allotment of 40,000 metric tonnes was done in mid-may with a terse order to dispose of the stocks by may 31. we merely requested them for a time extension till september 25, the end of the monsoon,"" he said. union minister of state for rural development m.k. anna patil had last week accused the state government of not lifting the food stocks for disbursement under the foodfor-work scheme.

4,Heritage activists to oppose relaxation of development rules,"mumbai: there''s a storm in the offing for heritage conservationists. proposals to conserve the character of dadar-matunga may run aground against formidable pro-development rules which allow reconstruction of cessed buildings in the island city.

the conservation blueprint for dadar-matunga, created by architects in the kamla raheja institute for architecture and environment and commissioned by the bmc''s heritage committee, proposes that the height of redeveloped buildings be restricted to 17 metres, and floor space index (fsi) limited to 1.33.

while the proposal has yet to come up for consideration, sources say that there will be considerable pressure to relax the restrictions since they clash with rules for old cessed buildings.

``there is tremendous pressure on the heritage committee to relax the height and fsi restrictions,'''' says an architect. ``indications are that the bmc is unwilling because of the lobbies behind fsi incentive schemes.''''

cess rules permit extra fsi to be given as incentives for builders to redevelop cessed buildings. in addition, a notification of 1998 removed the cap on the amount of excess fsi that could be given as incentive, while another in 1999 exempted cessed buildings which fall into grade iii heritage status or were unlisted, from taking permission from the heritage committee.

both notifications were then vigorously opposed by heritage and housing activists as nothing more than ``a bonanza for builders'''' and a disaster for the localities. there are 96 cessed structures in mumbai, most of which are in the heritage grade ii and iii categories but also a few hundred unlisted but architecturally significant cessed structures in areas like parsi colony.

activists say that since the recent notifications on cessed buildings, dozens of high-rises have sprung up in hindu colony, parsi colony and matunga, causing congestion in the area. for example, there are as many as ten proposals currently pending with the bmc for just one road in parsi colony, the jame jamshed road.

says aniruddh paul, deputy director of the kamla raheja institute. ``the influx of people, cars and the changing character of the area has put an unbearable pressure on the infrastructure there.'''' confirms resident praveen gandhi, ``since the crop of high-rises, the streets have become congested, parking is inadequate and the sewage system cannot cope.''''

heritage committee member cyrus guzdar says the study will help the heritage cause since ``they highlight the contradiction between the heritage rules and cessed buildings rules. to resolve this, amendments will have to be made to the development control rules to bring these buildings back into the purview of the heritage committee,'''' he says, adding, however, that this is likely to be a long and difficult process.

in tackling the liberalised fsi rules for cessed buildings, conservationists will not only come into conflict with the powerful builders'' lobby, but also tenants of cessed buildings.

ashok sanghvi, for example, who resides in a two-storied 60-year-old building behind podar college, matunga can''t wait for the builders to redevelop his apartment. mr sanghvi, with 11 other tenants, will get a 800 square-foot new flat in place of his 600 sq ft old one, in a new building, in addition to other benefits. ``even though, we have been squabbling with the builder for the last two years, eventually, i know the scheme will benefit me,'''' he says. ``heritage restrictions on height are not practical, unless the government is willing to pay for the reconstruction of all these old buildings.''''

his attitude is in direct conflict with old timers in the area, especially those in the increasingly vigilant residents associations, who want to limit development in the area. ``we want to see the area preserved the way it was, not the car-clogged colony it is now,'''' says mr gandhi, who was born and brought up in parsi colony. mr gandhi, however, admits that he is not under the same pressures as others. ``many tenants need the extra space for growing families, sons who are getting married, and changing lifestyles. many of the buildings balconies have already been enclosed to create another room, so desperate are people for more space.''''

in fact, the kamla raheja architects acknowledged the need for accommodating development by refraining from a ban on new development or construction in their proposal. and rather than ask for a withdrawal of incentive fsi, they suggest that the extra fsi for cessed buildings be given as transfer development rights, or tdr, to be consumed in the suburbs.

given the disastrous effect of tdr in suburbs like bandra and vile parle, however, critics point out that this will just displace the problem of congestion from one place to another. mr paul is more optimistic, ``if tdr is used in carefully selected places where there is enough infrastructure to bear the additional load of people or in new townships, it will not be bad,'''' he says.

5,`Sexual minorities' plan to stage silent protest,"mumbai: for the first time, mumbai's sexual minorities will emerge out of the darkness of public psyche into a sunlit city square on friday. wearing their identities on their sleeves, gays, lesbians, trans-sexuals and other so-called fringe groups will stage an unprecedented demonstration at flora fountain from 4-8 pm. lawyers representing the sexual minorities will also be part of the demonstration. the central issues prompting the stir include the arrest of five social workers in lucknow in july and abolition of section 377. ``this is the first time that we will be so visible. besides protesting against the arrests and section 377, which criminalises homosexuality, we're going to tell people about our sexual identities,'' said geeta kumana, project coordinator of aanchal, a lesbian group. on july 7, five outreach workers from bharosa, an organisation working in the field of `men having sex with men' (msm), were arrested in lucknow while they were distributing free condoms. the sexual minorities in the city have taken the issue up to highlight the misuse and abuse of section 377, which defines ``carnal knowledge against the course of nature''. ``this section forbids consensual same-sex activity and places in the same category as bestiality, or sex with animals,'' said ashoke row kavi, chairman, humsafar trust. ``one needs to abolish section 377 and strengthen section 376__rape. this will bring offences like rape of young boys under section 377,'' he said. according to ms kumana, section 377 is also abused by parents of homosexuals, who ``blackmail them into marriage, threatening to hand them over to the police otherwise''. organisers say friday's demonstration will be quiet. ``we'll be talking to people while distributing leaflets. there will be posters as well. we will ask people who support our cause to light a candle,'' said ms kumana, adding that they had not got police permission to stage streetplays.

6,Bangladeshis arrested for murder,"new delhi: the police claim they have arrested five bangladesh nationals allegedly responsible for at least 40 heinous crimes, including a murder and a number of armed robberies. the five accused have been identified as mohammed jehangir (22), mohammed ibrahim (28), mohammed fazlu (28), mohammed jamal (38) and mohammed yunus sheikh (60). police officials claimed that they recovered several locally made pistols, live cartridges and knives from the accused. north district police chief sanjay baniwal said that there had been a number of armed robberies in the recent past following which a special team comprising officials from operations cell, special staff and auto theft squad was set up to investigate the matter. the police said during questioning the accused said they had committed crimes in several parts of the capital, including sultanpuri, mangolpuri, ashok vihar, rohini, alipur, bawana, chandni chowk, kashmere gate, mehrauli, vasant kunj, ghitorni, mahipalpur, auchandi border, gokulpuri, sarai rohilla and wazirabad.

7,Car thefts leave lawyers in the lurch,"new delhi: theft of cars and accessories is on the rise in the various courts of the capital. the delhi high court has reported nine incidents of theft of car accessories in the past five months. all the cars were parked within the court complex. a car was also stolen from the court last week. similarly, 14 cars were stolen from the tis hazari courts this year. this is apart from sundry theft of car accessories. while patiala house court has not reported any car being lifted from its premises in the past two years, the theft of accessories is on the rise. this is despite the fact that parking in court premises is restricted to lawyers, judges and court officials. litigants have to park outside. lawyers suspect the involvement of insiders in these thefts. delhi high court bar association president amarjit singh chandhioke said, ''although we have not been able to identify the culprits, we assume it is the handiwork of insiders.'' but another high court advocate felt the main suspects were the lawyers' drivers. ''they are the ones who remain in the cars when lawyers attend court. the association has decided to vet drivers,'' he said. the bar association has set a time limit for the lawyers to get their drivers verified by the police and procure identity cards from the association. only drivers with the identity cards will be permitted to enter the court premises. ''we will take strict action if the directions are not adhered to,'' said chandhioke. in addition, four police officials in plain clothes will be posted in the high court complex till 6 pm. the size of the tis hazari courts make it difficult for the police to maintain a check. ''the maximum number of car thefts were reported in the may and june. but after june 9, when we posted men at the gates, only one case was reported,'' said a police official. according to him, returnable slips are issued to the drivers on entry. but delhi bar association secretary jatan singh said: ''the police have not done enough to tighten security. the association had to employ extra staff to keep watch. but tis hazari has so many entry points that sometimes cars are parked outside the guards' purview.'' the finger of suspicion also points to visitors. and in certain instances, like in the case of the patiala house courts, it is the lack of adequate parking space. ''cars are parked are often left in neutral to facilitate parking of other cars. it is possible that somebody manages to unlock it during this process,'' said k k manan, president of the new delhi bar association.

""if crime is not checked then muzaffarpur will be repeated in every town of the state,"" he insisted. bjp leader nand kishore yadav said the kidnapping was like a self-employment scheme sponsored by the state government.

10,NDA trying to politicise Muzaffarpur incident: Laloo,"patna: rjd supremo laloo prasad yadav criticised the nda for trying to take political mileage out of the muzaffarpur tragedy. ""they have no interest in restoring normalcy and are trying to politicise the whole matter. they are shedding crocodile tears"", he said while talking to mediapersons on thursday. he warned that the government would expose the people trying to defame the government. the rjd chief said that the government had taken the muzaffarpur incident seriously and a special team is already in the strife torn town to make a comprehensive inquiry. ""it would also probe the slackness on the part of the local administration"", he said. he, however, conceded that the initial `misinformation' by the town police was caused by the report of the civil surgeon and doctors that the body recovered was aged more than 12 years. ""later the body was identified by the child's parents but it gave the impression that the police was hiding facts"", he stated insisting that the anger of the local people into the brutal murder was natural. commenting on the inhuman murder of golu he said that ""in earlier cases of kidnapping of children in the state, the kidnappers provided them biscuits and milk, but the way he was murdered was rather strange. it was aimed at inciting the people to react violently and defame the government."" he said that there was a deep-rooted conspiracy behind the heinous act. ""we will expose and penalise the organisation behind this act"", he vowed. speaking on spate of kidnapping of doctors in the state he said that in the case of dr k k singh, it had come to light that a person from the same profession was involved. he came down heavily on the nda and alleged that a few of its members were trying to spread rumours in muzaffarpur by phone from within the state assembly. he flayed the nda for not allowing the assembly to function and pointed out that the debate on issues like flood, drought and power supply had not been allowed in the house and charged that the alliance was not concerned about the welfare of the people.

11,6 SIMI activists arrested,"hyderabad: following the imposition of ban on the students' islamic movement of india (simi), the city police took at least six of its important cadre into custody on wednesday. according to police, the simi activists, who were taken into custody include, simi andhra pradesh unit president athar quereshi, simi secretary yasar alias muqhimuddin, office-bearers -- javed amin, fasiuddin, ahmed, and mohteshim. all of them were arrested in a pre-dawn swoop at the simi office located at chaderghat and other places in the old city. a communique received by the city police from the union government said it had approved imposition of ban on simi under section 3 (1) of the unlawful activities (prevention) act, 1967. the ban will be effective in andhra pradesh only after the state government ratifies the centre's order. a senior official in the home department said the state government would shortly ratify the ban and seize the office premises and other assets owned by the simi. police sources said simi had been emerging as an important outfit among the minority community students in the city and elsewhere in the state. the simi is said to be active in a couple of junior and degree colleges located in the old city and also in the west zone limits, besides an engineering college in the city. anticipating stern action from the centre, the intelligence agencies kept a watch on the activities of the simi leaders and picked them up hours before the government clamping a ban on the outfit. simi all india general secretary shahid badr falahi had recently visited the city and addressed several meetings. during a press conference he held in the city, falahi demanded a ban on rss and vhp and invited union home minister l k advani to embrace islam.

12,Lapses in police verification of passports due to increased workload,"hyderabad: there are lapses in police verification of passport applicants as the `workload' is said to be more than what the special branch police can carry out everyday. sixty head constables attached to the special branch wing of the city police have to verify the credentials of over 72,000 people who apply for passports from the city every year. it means on an average, a head constable attached has to do a minimum of five passport verifications a day. they also find it difficult to locate the addresses of the passport applicants. they are also given no money to meet the travelling expenses. according to the procedure, the constables have to verify the antecedents of the applicants at both the present and permanent addresses, and also cross-check the details from the references cited in the application forms. the constables are also required to find out whether an applicant has provided genuine information with regard to his age, and educational details. but in reality, the verification does not happen the way it has to. since the special branch office has to forwards the verifications to the passport office within a stipulated time, proper verification does not take place. according to a special branch constable, they have to go to an applicant's house several times to get the details. a sb official said several of the government employees apply for passports without producing the required no-objection certification (noc). ""in such cases, we will have to depend solely on the information provided by the individual or the neighbours,"" the official said. the official said the staff were facing much difficulties in filing verification certificates with regard to minority community women, who follow purdah culture. ""we do not have women constables to independently verify the claims,"" he said. another area, where the constables are being hoodwinked is the affidavits submitted for illiterate candidates. the sb staff are to believe the statement on the age furnished in the affidavit and there is absolutely no independent mechanism to cross-check such information. when contacted, city police commissioner p ramulu said the state government was being requested to sanction additional 60 head constable posts to meet the requirement.

""with the terrorist groups, we are already at war. banning will not help stop their activities. while groups like simi have a front office and were operating overground, ''legitimately'' functioning against the interests of the state. so they have to be banned."" asked about the charge of simi''s links with the al-qaeda and other terrorist groups, pande asserted that the government had sufficient evidence. ""we have to be certain of the evidence. because we know that the matter will be referred to a tribunal within 30 days where it would be scrutinised,"" he said. the tribunal, which will be headed by a sitting high court judge, will adjudicate the ban within six months. in delhi, three office-bearers of simi were also arrested from its office in zakir nagar. the office was also sealed. the arrested leaders were produced in the court of metropolitan magistrate vinod kumar who rejected their bail and sent them to judicial custody for 14 days. meanwhile, pakistan on friday refused to comment on imposition of ban on simi, saying it was the internal matter of india. ""we do not wish to comment on the internal situation in india,"" foreign office spokesman riaz mohammad khan told reporters here in reply to a question seeking pakistan''s reaction. on friday, a delhi court rejected the bail plea of badr and three others on the ground that they had published an article in their magazine ""hurting"" sentiments of buddhists. rejecting the bail plea of badr, saif nachan, mohd khalid and irfan khan, who were arrested for raising provocative slogans in protest against the ban on the organisation, metropolitan magistrate vinod kumar remanded them to 14 days of judicial custody. referring to the order banning simi, he said: ""i have carefully gone through the notification which has been published in gazette of india extraordinarily on september 27 which has banned simi with immediate effect. i am of the opinion that at this stage this is sufficient to reject the bail application"". advocate feroz khan ghazi, appearing for the simi activists had contended that prosecution had neither disclosed the offences under the unlawful activities (prevention) act nor any notification has been published in the gazette. he said the tribunal has also not been constituted in this regard. referring to a prominent article in the magazine ""islamic movement"" published by the outfit, the judge said ""it has one prominent article on ''taliban bamian and budh'', the reading of which is enough to show that this magazine and article has been published with the sole aim to hurt and cause ill will to the followers of lord buddha. the bail application is therefore dismissed."" the court also rejected the bail plea of asif mohd khan, the controversial municipal councillor from okhla, who was arrested on charges of causing communal disharmony by printing and circulating posters to create enmity between christians and muslims and remanded him to 14 days of judicial custody. ""the contents of the posters attempt to promote the enmity, hatred and ill will between muslims and christians and if the accused is enlarged on bail it will encourage elements whose interests lay in promoting such ill will,"" the court said. it said the poster showing ""war between christianity and islam is more unfortunate because mohd saheb (peace be upon him) himself had great reverence for lord christ and acknowledged him as pegambar of the god"". khan allegedly had got pasted the posters on buses and public places praising saudi terrorist mastermind osama bin laden following the terrorist strikes in the us. the magistrate said ""references to war between christianity and islam have been given in quite bold letters"" in the posters, ""the meaning of which has to be read in the context with the recent developments after the attacks on the world trade centre in america"". stating that great restraint on behalf of all citizens was required in the present political and social atmosphere, the court said ""the representative of people who had taken oath to a secular constitution ... a councillor has greater responsibilities than others"". in lucknow, ssp b b bakshi said no untoward incident had been reported since thursday when four persons were killed in police firing on a rampaging mob protesting against simi arrests in the old city. the up government ordered a probe by the commissioner, lucknow division, into the violence and the police firing.

20,Hindujas threaten to sue AP government,"hyderabad:the hinduja national power corporation limited (hnpcl), whose 1,040 mw power project has been postponed for implementation to the 11th five-year plan, has threatened to sue the government for compensation for the ""effort and expenditure incurred"" in developing the project. in a recent letter addressed to principal secretary (energy) v s sampath, r j shahaney, the chairman of hinduja group company ashok leyland, said that the firm was extremely disappointed with the postponement. sampath had sent a communication in july asking the hindujas to postpone their project for implementation to the 11th five-year plan period. in his reply, shahaney wrote, ""your proposal now to delay the project for at least six years has come to us as a shock, particularly when subsequent projects have been accommodated in the tenth plan p r e s u m a b l y thereby leading to your present proposal to defer our vizag project to the eleventh plan. he also said, ""it is unfortunate that the 'fast track' vizag project has been allowed to languish whereas other new projects have been facilitated to proceed."" recalling the commitment made by the government to the development of the vizag power project, the letter said that the validity of the power purchase agreement (ppa) was extended up to sept. 30, 2001. ""all these have confirmed our belief thus far that the government was fully supportive of the vizag power project. however, it would now appear from the tone and contents of your letter that there are second thoughts on allowing the project to proceeds as envisaged, he wrote. referring to the suggestion to equate the hinduja project's tariff with that fixed for simhadri, the company contended that the two projects are not comparable as they are based on divergent commercial principles. the hindujas have regretted that despite a investment reduction of rs 415 crore on their project, the government had not responded. ""we would expect the government to reimburse all expenses incurred by the sponsors in taking various effective steps towards implementation of the project, failing which the sponsors would have no option left but to pursue all available remedies including legal to obtain proper compensation, the letter threatened. he, however, hastened to add,""this is certainly not our preferred option.

24,Private airlines to adopt marshal rule,"mumbai: the country's two private airlines, jet airways and air sahara, will deploy sky marshals on select routes which are considered sensitive. aviation sources told tnn on tuesday that the centre cleared the proposal to have sky marshals on domestic flights on monday. they will be drawn from the national security guard (nsg) unit. the order came 48 hours after civil aviation minister shahnawaz hussain told a meeting in patna that it was imperative that private airlines carry sky marshals in the wake of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington using four hijacked boeings. the main role of the sky marshals will be to deal with hijackers. they are trained in handling weapons and also undergo basic flying training. the sources said that while jet may implement the plan soon, sahara may have to wait for some time to get the armed flying commandos. jet operates nearly 225 flights daily to about 45 destinations. air sahara flies to 13 destinations, operating 37 daily flights. from mumbai it has flights to delhi, jaipur, bangalore, lucknow, patna, kolkata and goa. once jet gets the commandos, they will be deployed on routes like the one between delhi and srinagar or the kolkata-imphal sector. ""these routes are considered very sensitive,"" said a jet official. initially, the idea of having sky marshals did not find much favour with private carriers because of the additional costs involved. however, the recent developments in the us finally convinced them that it would be in their own interest to have these marshals as it would ensure passenger and crew safety. in the us, the federal aviation adminstration (faa) has currently embarked on a major drive to recruit sky marshals who would be deployed on domestic flights. indian airlines (ia) started deploying sky marshals on some of its routes in the wake of the 1999 christmas-eve hijacking of an ia airbus aircraft while it was flying from kathmandu to delhi. an ia pilot said the deployment of sky marshals was adding to the financial burden of the airline. ""but one certainly feels secure having them on board,"" he said. while supporting the need for sky marshals in principle, he said an important question has not yet been resolved. ""in case these sky marshals are forced to open fire at a hijacker at an altitude of 33,000 feet and some vital aircraft equipment gets damaged, jeopardising the safety of the flight, who will be responsible __ the commander or the sky marshal?"" the pilot questioned. in another development, the faa has asked all airlines operating to the u.s. to provide a backgrounder about its employees working at the airports. air-india operates flights to new york and chicago and has a total of about 25 employees working at jfk and chicago's o' hare airports. ``we have out-contracted the rest of the jobs like security and ground handling at both these airports,'' said an airline spokesperson.
