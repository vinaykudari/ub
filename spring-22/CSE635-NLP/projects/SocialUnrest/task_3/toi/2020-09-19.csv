0,Zahira's sister-in-law takes over bakery,"VADODARA: Even as the Best Bakery case was being heard in the country''s highest court on Friday, the sister-in-law of Zahira Sheikh, the star witness who turned hostile, was busy cleaning up and renovating the gutted bakery at Hanuman Tekri.

Yasminbanu Sheikh plans to stay on at the bakery which witnessed the worst carnage in Vadodara in last year''s communal violence.

She hopes to start a business and a new life and shouldn''t have any problems from the Hindu neighbours â€” 21 of whom were acquitted after the trial in the fast-track on June 27 â€” as she disputes Zahira''s version of the events on March 1, 2002.

Repair work at the dilapidated bakery was on at a brisk pace on Friday afternoon.

Yasmin and her mother Rashidabibi were overseeing the masons, who were cementing the broken walls.

Also present at the spot were Lal Mohammed and Kanu Panchal, who claims to be a social worker.

Interestingly, Panchal was often spotted with local BJP MLA Madhu Shrivastav during the Best Bakery hearings and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) team''s visit to the city.

Lal Mohammed, the person now accused of threatening Zahira and forcing her to turn hostile in court, had resurfaced on the day of the NHRC team''s visit and had said that the statement made by Zahira to the media was false.

He gave interviews under the benign gaze of Shrivastav at the Circuit House here.

He had deposed before the fast-track court that the accused were innocent and had in fact saved lives.

Panchal kept prompting Yasmin while she was speaking to TNN and kept shadowing reporters in the Hanuman Tekri area.

Yasminbanu claims that she had managed to escape from the bakery when a mob went on rampage there.

""I informed a police patrol in the area about the incident. However, my name never appeared in the FIR and I was never called to depose before the court,"" she said.

Yasminbanu, the first wife of Zahira''s brother, who''s now married to a Hindu woman, claims she does not know any person from the mob that attacked the bakery.

""None of them were from this locality,"" she claimed, as Panchal nodded his approval.

When it was pointed out that she was contradicting Zahira, Yasminbanu shot back saying, ""She''s lying. I was present when the attack took place and saw whatever happened here.""

""People here had tried to save us and asked us to leave during the riots. However, we had to stay back as my mother-in-law (Zahira''s mother) was worried about the stock lying at the bakery,"" she said.

Lal Mohammed, on the other hand, said he was there to reconstruct his godown, which was partially burnt during the riots.

""There is absolutely no threat to Yasminbanu and her mother. Their views regarding the incident are the same as ours,"" he said.

Rashidabibi said, ""We are not afraid of staying here though people say that the bakery is haunted.We have faith in Allah and he will take care of us.""

Residents of the area are all sympathy for Yasminbanu and her mother.

""They will be like our neighbours. We will keep relations with them like others staying here,"" said Chatur Chiman Baria, a resident of Hanuman Tekri.

1,"Rage runs riot, hits demolition squad","MOHALI: They could demolish their shops, but not their hardened rage. An eight member anti-encroachment squad of the Mohali municipal council (MC) struck on the illegal kiosks on the Chandigarh-Mohali border, near Phase VI, on Friday, demolishing 40 of them.

However, the residents of a nearby labour colony, to whom the kiosks belonged, were not willing to take it lying down.

They retaliated by pelting the MC staff with stones. In the process, three MC employees â€” enforcement incharge Avtar Singh Kalasia, JCB driver Amrik Singh and tractor driver Puran Singh â€” were injured. They have been admitted to Civil Hospital here.

The MC''s JCB was also damaged in the stone-pelting. A badly-bruised Avtar Singh said the team had completed the demolitions and was moving ahead to another target when a mob of around 500 people surrounded them. ''''They tried to provoke us into attacking them. A woman in the mob started shoving a broom into my face and when I struck it aside with my stick, they started shouting that we were attacking their women. And then, all hell broke loose,'''' he said. Other members of the team said that as soon as the mob attacked them, they ran for their lives. Almost all of them were hit by stones, but only three sustained serious injuries.

Residents of the labour colony claimed that their shops were on UT land and the Mohali MC had no right to demolish them.

''''They have always been taking this plea. The area is within the Mohali municipal limits. Their kiosks were left untouched when the Chandigarh administration, over a year ago, had removed some encroachments,'''' area councillor Rajinder Sharma said. The MC has lodged a complaint at the Phase I police station.

2,Hanspal helps end labour unrest,"CHANDIGARH: The labour unrest in the cycle and light engineering industry in Ludhiana is likely to be defused after the issues agitating the workers were resolved following mediation by Punjab Congress chief H S Hanspal.

Punjab Congress secretary Parminder Mehta, meanwhile, said that workers had cancelled their ongoing agitation and all issues would be settled between the labour leaders and industrialists soon. Hanspal said that his party would not associate with any element trying to create labour unrest in selfinterest.

A delegation of the industrialists, led by district Congress chief (urban) Jagmohan Sharma and D S Chawla of United Cycles, met Hanspal, here on Friday, and alleged that some INTUC leaders were fomenting unrest among workers in Ludhiana who had begun striking work in one industry after another.

Chawla said that there had been no unionism in the cycle industry and the workers and the industrialists had cordial relations for close to fifty years now. But, suddenly, industrial harmony had started becoming vitiated because of vested interests and â€˜â€˜outsideâ€™â€™ elements.

Such activity, he said, had the potential to ruin the highly competitive cycle industry which survived on sheer volume of production.

The representatives from Hero Cycles, Nova Cycles, Bhogal and Sons and Kumar Industries had urged Hanspal to intervene as those spearheading agitation either were Congress functionaries or INTUC leaders. INTUC is the labour front of the party. They had particularly blamed Joginder Singh Sarhali and his son Sarbjit Singh for fanning unrest.

Chawla said that they strictly adhered to labour laws and were paying the highest wages and giving all benefits to the labour yet trouble had been brewing in their units. Instead of approaching them or the labour department for the redressal of grievances, if any, these selfstyled leaders had been bent upon creating unrest, the industry representatives alleged.

3,Unions lash out at Wilson principal,"MUMBAI: The teaching and non-teaching staff unions of Mumbai university on Friday demanded that Wilson college principal, V.J. Sarwaiya, be asked to go on leave till the university inquiry concerning the death of Darshini Jadhav is completed.

Jadhav, an assistant librarian at Wilson College, had consumed poison on September 12 in the college premises to protest against the alleged harassment by college officials. Jadhav, who had been admitted to Nair hospital, died on Thursday morning.

Jadhavâ€™s husband, Gautam, has lodged an FIR against Sarwaiya, viceprincipal S.G. Joshi and librarian Subhangi Gavandkar for abetting the suicide.

The police found a suicide note in Jadhavâ€™s bag, which states that she was being harassed by college officials. Mumbai university has also set up a three-member committee to conduct an independent inquiry.

Meanwhile, Sarwaiya and two others have applied for anticipatory bail.

â€œThe facts of the matter suggest that Jadhav was forced to take the extreme step by the manner, in which she was suspended and later subjected to a long-winded inquiry,â€� Bombay university college teachersâ€™ union general secretary Tapati Mukhopadhyay said.

Jadhav was suspended in March last year when she protested about the increased workload after the college introduced some non-aided courses three years ago.

â€œColleges have started non-aided courses without actually hiring additional people to handle the work. This has put tremendous pressure on the non-teaching staff,â€� Mukhopadhyay said.

Meanwhile, the non-teaching staff of several colleges in the city stayed away from work on Friday to protest the alleged harassment meted out by college officials to Jadhav. The condolence meeting held at Wilson College in the morning saw a huge turnout of people.

4,MSEB tries to rein in farmers,"PUNE: In a bid to soften up farmers into accepting metered supply of electricity, the Pune circle the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) conducted a novel experiment to demonstrate that electricity meters do not â€˜run fastâ€™ and that farmers would end up saving money if they fitted meters.

The experiment was conducted last week in a village in Ambegaon near Pune â€” the constituency of energy minister Dilip Walse-Patil, who insisted that the demonstration be conducted in the presence of local farmers.

A team of MSEB officials fitted as many as nine meters â€” both electromechanical and electronic â€” on a 5 horse power (HP) agricultural pump in a farm in village Khadki in Ambegaon.

A panch committee, comprising farmers Devdatta Nikam, Shivaji Dhobale and Nana Ghodekar, witnessed the entire operation. An electronic check meter, to confirm the accuracy of the readings in the nine meters, was also fitted on the transformer.

Speaking to TNN on Friday, MSEB officials said that the pump was operated for three hours during the morning peak hours and for two hours in the non-peak afternoon hours. â€œAll the four meters and the check meter showed that 17 units were consumed during the operation,â€� officials said.

The MSEB used old as well as new meters manufactured by different manufacturers for the experiment, to ensure that no doubt or suspicion remained uncleared, officials added. Officials pointed out that there has been stiff resistance from farmers to electricity meters.

There have been incidents in the recent past of MSEB officials being beaten up by irate farmers when they tried installing meters to agri-pumps as directed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC).

To drive home their point, MSEB officials also showed farmers how they would end up saving money if they accepted metered supply in place of the existing HP-based supply.

â€œWe showed them that irrigating sugarcane on 4 acres with the help of 5 HP pumps throughout the year would cost them Rs 4,516 as per MERC tariff if they accept meters,â€� officials stated.

Considering that the government gave subsidy of 74 paise per unit, the annual electricity bill would be Rs 3,499. On the other hand, if they insisted on HP-based supply, they would have to shell out Rs 7,200 per year for irrigating sugarcane on 4 acres with 5 HP agripumps, officials explained.

With the MERC breathing down MSEBâ€™s neck for giving only metered supply to agricultural consumers, officials hoped that the 1 lakh agricultural consumers in Pune circle would allow the board to fit meters.

5,Two college girls commit suicide,"NEW DELHI: Two college girls committed suicide in New Delhi over the past two days â€” Shubhra Tanwar was reportedly driven to it because she was unable to tackle her obesity, while Arpita was suffering from depression for some months.

Shubhra, 19, was an undergraduate law student of Jamia Millia Islamia and was found dead in her parentsâ€™ Sector 29 flat in Noida this week. While police are saying she committed suicide as she was depressed about being obese, the university, which held a condolence meeting on Thursday, says it was told the girl died of a brain tumour.

There is a conflict regarding the date too. As per the information received by the university, the girl died on Wednesday. But police officers in Noida say the girl committed suicide on Thursday morning.

Noidaâ€™s Sector 20 police chief Arjun Singh told Times News Network Shubhra was depressed as she was overweight. The daughter of a serving Wing Commander in the IAF, she had tried virtually everything, including crash diets, to lose weight. After one of these â€˜crash dietsâ€™, about a month ago, Shubhra had reportedly gone into a coma, and had to be hospitalised. But after recuperating from the trauma of the diet, she went back on a strict exercise regimen.

If what the police are saying is true, Shubhraâ€™s is the second suicide prompted by weight concerns in the district this year. In the first case, another 19-year-old student had shot herself with her fatherâ€™s licensed .32 calibre revolver at her Dadri residence.

According to Singh, Shubhraâ€™s suicide happened sometime between 10 am and 11 am on Thursday. Shubhraâ€™s father, Wing Commander B K Tanwar, was away at work. Shubhraâ€™s sister and brother were at school. Shubhra and her mother, Alka Tanwar, were at home, in separate rooms.

At about 12.30 pm, her mother found Shubhraâ€™s bedroom locked from inside. Shubhra did not respond to shouts or knocking. So, the door was broken open by neighbours and she was found hanging from the ceiling fan. Her body was sent for an autopsy. But police said there did not, at first sight, appear to be any foul play.

Arpita, 20, was a final year BIT student of Acharya Narendra Dev College. The police said they received a call at 3 pm on Friday. The victim was found hanging from the ceiling fan with her dupatta at her Nehru Apartments residence in Kalkaji. Arpita was reportedly suffering from depression and had been undergoing treatment at VIMHANS. No suicide note has been found.

6,Punjabi varsity unrest: Badal condemns Amarinder,"CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal has warned Chief Minister Amarinder Singh against pursuing a path of confrontation with the student community.

In a statement here on Friday Badal condemned the manner the chief minister was handling students unrest in the Punjabi university, Patiala, and said instead of charting a course for the prosperous future of the youth of the state, the chief minister has chosen to confront them with police bayonets.

Badal said the police assault on media persons covering the student agitation on Wednesday was the an even worse act for which the chief minister should have taken action against erring policemen.

Meanwhile, the state CPI has announced to observe anti-repression day on September 30 to protest against the police action against the university students. Party secretary Joginder Dayal said the police had let lose repression on students and deprived them of their democratic right to protest.

He said the problem on the campus was being compounded by ""adamant"" stance of vice-chancellor S S Boparai. He demanded that cases registered against students be withdrawn.

7,"Medicos heed govt advice, call off strike","PATNA: The state government''s warning to the striking PG students of PMCH on Thursday that it might act tough with them if they did not call off their strike immediately seems to have had a salutary effect on the agitators as they called off their three-day old strike on Friday evening following talks with medical education secretary Afzal Amanullah.

The medicos also succeeded in getting an assurance from the government that their monthly stipend would be hiked soon.

Amanullah had on Thursday warned the striking PG students that the government would remove them from their respective PG courses and also debar them from the government service if they failed to call off their strike immediately.

They cannot hold the medicare system to ransom, he had said.

While giving an assurance on stipend hike during the talks on Friday, Amanullah remained firm on his stand that the striking medicos had got to call off their strike by Friday evening.

""We will not be talking as friends any more if you fail to call off your strike by 7.45 pm today,"" he told a delegation of the PG doctors and added, ""go, call a meeting of your general body and announce your decision to call off the strike this evening itself"".

Amanullah also gave the medicos a piece of advice. He told them to handle the attendants of patients in a dignified manner. ""You have undergone high-level professional training and are supposed to behave decently with people,"" he said.

Amanullah said he was not against a hike in the stipend of PG medical students as their counterparts in other states were getting a higher stipend. He assured the delegation that the government would soon initiate steps to raise their stipend to Rs 10,000 per month.

As of now, they get Rs 5,000 each for the first two years and Rs 6,000 during the third year of their three-year course.

He also assured the delegation that the government would include the construction of more hostels in the budget of the next financial year. He also conceded their demand to make the information centre of the hospital functional. The government would install coolers in the duty room of PG students.

The president of PMCH Junior Doctors'' Association, Dr Gauhar Alam later said the association has decided to call off the strike in the interest of the patients. This follows positive talks with the government, he added.

8,Tout arrested from CMCH,"KOLKATA: The alertness of a doctor helped net a tout at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) on Friday morning. The tout allegedly fleeced patients by promising to get their tests done at concessional rates.

Paresh alias Kaushik Mukherjee bungled up while trying to cheat the family of six-year-old Saurabh, who suffers from neurological problems. He was asked by his doctor at the Bangur Institute of Neurology to get an MRI-scan done.

The childâ€™s father, Dum Dum resident Krishnapada Das, was at a loss where to go. The expense was also a matter of worry. Mukherjee, who stayed in the same locality, approached them saying he had enough clout at CMCH to get the test done at concessional rate.

Two days ago, he approached CMCH principal Jayashree Mitra using his alleged credentials as a â€œformer Red Cross employeeâ€�.

On hearing that the patient was a six-year old, Mitra readily agreed to waive the complete charges of the MRI scan, which costs around Rs 4,000. Mukherjee, however, took Rs 2,000 from Das, saying he had managed to extract a 50 per cent concession on the test fee.

The lie was detected when Das refused to buy an injection for his son, saying he had already â€œpaid the feesâ€�. The attending doctor, Samir Kundu, smelt something fishy and told the father that the hospital had waived the charges.

9,"Blame dowry, stress for women’s suicide dash","KOLKATA: It was the disturbing statistics â€” two suicides by women every day â€” that led the CID on a painstaking study of the pattern of suicides in Bengal. The results were startling: married women were killing themselves more often than jilted lovers or poverty-stricken teenagers.

And the culprit in most cases â€” dowry. Take the case of Kakoli Dalapati, 22, of Regent Park.

She got married in November 2001. On August 12, she was found hanging in her house with a dupatta. She had attempted suicide twice before. Her brother alleged of torture by her husband. The same day Sujata Halder, 30, was found hanging in her house at Sonarpur. The police say she committed suicide due to â€œmarital problemsâ€�.

â€œGoing by the daily crime statistics compiled by the criminal intelligence wing of the CID, it was found that almost every day there were a couple of suicides, â€� said Raj Kanojia, DIG, CID.

But, there has been no comprehensive study on the various aspects related to suicide including reasons that push a person to commit suicide or areas more prone to this tendency. This prompted a team of CID officers led by IG CID (II) Naparajit Mukherjee to conduct the survey over a period of three years from 2000 to 2002.

While in 2000, 443 suicides were reported, the number dropped to 395 cases in 2001. The year 2002 saw a sharp rise in the number of suicides notching up 609 cases, said Kanojia.

Apart from suicides related to dowry, the survey revealed that males are more prone to committing suicides than females. In 2000, 20 men and five women committed suicide. In the year 2001, 23 men and six women killed themselves while in 2003, 25 men and six women committed suicide.

Financial reasons and related stress was found to be the main reason for men committing suicides. Other than dowry, women commonly committed suicide when they were jilted in love or were unsuccessful in examinations, said Kanojia.

Residents of suburban areas and industrial belt were prone to suicide, said Kanojia. The tendency was much less as one goes towards north Bengal. In 2000, the highest number of cases were reported from South 24-Parganas and the lowest from Cooch Behar. The maximum number of cases occurred in Hooghly in 2001 and North 24-Parganas in 2002. The tallies for Jalpaiguri and South Dinajpur were the lowest in 2001 and 2002 respectively. The report will be submitted to the government.

10,Priority to farm sector for supply of power,"HYDERABAD: Power supply to the industrial sector will be reduced to ensure adequate supply to agricultural consumers, so that standing crops can be saved.

""All possible steps would be taken to ensure that not even a single acre in the state withers due to lack of power,"" chief minister Chandrababu Naidu said during an interacting with district collectors at a video conference on Friday.

He asked officials to interact with the farmers and find out what their power requirement is.

Transco officials were told to replace transformers that need repairs at the earliest possible time. Transformers should be replaced within 12 hours in urban areas and 24 hours in rural areas. Transco CMD Rachel Chatterjee was directed to enquire into the long time being taken to replace transformers in the West Godavari district.

The chief minister asked the officials to complete the electrification works by the end of March. The Transco officials said that a new software, Transformer Information Management System has been developed by the department to monitor the status of all transformers.

The existing e-procurement software will also be modified to suit the requirements of the Discoms in identifying and purchasing transformers.

Reviewing the agriculture sector, Naidu asked civil supplies department officials and joint collectors to ensure that farmers get minimum support prices for their produce.

Farmers should be made aware of water management processes so that they can cultivate the maximum area with less water. When the Nellore district collector asked the government to take up cloud seeding experiment under the catchment area of Somasila project, Naidu said the process is still in an experimental stage.

Radio Mirchi has maintained a consistent record and has emerged right on top with over 50% share in listenership in Kolkata as well as leading in every other city of launch.

That 98.3 FM has touched the right chord in the hearts of the Kolkata listeners has also been due to the brilliant presentation skills of the radio jockeys. â€˜With Radio Mirchi, you should be prepared to expect the unexpectedâ€™, was a point underscored by the noted film director, Ashutosh Gowarikar.

However, the manner in which student leaders have been campaigning even before nominations, as per the high court order, almost all of them are guilty of violation of code of conduct and logically in danger of losing their candidature.

14,"SP, Cong candidates also enter LUSU polls","LUCKNOW: Lucknow University Students Union (LUSU) elections were further electrified on Friday when Samajwadi Party and Congress also announced their candidates for the post of LUSU president.

While Abhishek Singh Ashu will be the official candidate of SP''s student outfit Samajwadi Chhatrasabha, Gopal Rai was declared as candidate of National Students Union of India (NSUI). The amount of political prestige at stake could be gauged from the fact that announcement of these candidates came after a long delay and only after ''clearance'' by the ''high command''.

Four former LUSU presidents, Rakesh Singh Rana, MLA from Haidergarh Arvind Singh Gope, Arvind Kumar Singh and Brahma Baksha Singh Gopal, announced the name of sitting vice-president Ashu in a hurriedly convened press conference at DPA hall in LU.

Outside the hall, it was a brazen display of pomp and grandeur as over two dozen luxury vehicles, sporting party flags were packed with supporters and private escorts of student leaders, brandishing firearms and mobile phones. There were also some police officers, who were trying to be ''intimate'' with the student leaders belonging to the ruling party.

SP''s announcement came after two days of hectic deliberation in the party. Twice the announcement was postponed as there was hectic lobbying for the ticket. Party sources said there were recommendations for over half a dozen strong contenders from MLAs to MPs and senior politicians.

Faced with the problem of plenty, SP finally approved Ashu, as it was felt that he had kept alive party activities on LU campus, during the last three years.

The Congress made the announcement on NSUI candidates for president, vice-president and general secretary posts in a press conference held at party headquarters, after the approval of All India Congress Committee, secretary and UP incharge Subodh Kant Sahai and UP Congress president Jagdambika Pal. In contrast, the Congress was faced with a crisis of candidate. Thus Gopal Rai, who joined the party on Thursday evening, was declared the NSUI candidate for president on Friday.

Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), students wing of Bharatiya Janta Party, and Students Federation of India (SFI), All India Students Association (AISA), owing affiliation to Communist parties, have already announced their candidates earlier.

15,Plan to rope in private sector to insure farmers,"NEW DELHI: In a move which has government gung-ho but economists wary, the Centre plans to rope in private companies to insure farmers against both price and yield fluctuations.

A committee of secretaries â€” from agriculture, finance and banking â€” is working out the details of the scheme, primarily aimed at insuring farmers against the difference between the market price and the minimum support price for crops announced by the government. They are to give their report by the month-end.

This income insurance, complete with a subsidy on premium, would tie in with the existing crop insurance scheme, with a comprehensive insurance cover coming from one company.

A presentation was made to the finance minister on Thursday and he has agreed, in principle, said Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh on Friday. ""It will be a historic decision; all farmers will be assured of the right price,'' said Singh. The reduction of food subsidy, insisted officials, will be just a happy byproduct.

Private companies will have to step in, given the magnitude of the task. ""We will start it on an experimental basis,"" said Singh.

Initially, what is being considered is a pilot project which should, ideally, cover one or more districts in each state â€” insuring a few crops to begin with â€” and watch how the scheme performs in the field. If it picks up pace and covers crores of farmers, the government could relax and limit its procurement efforts to buys for the public distribution system and a buffer stock.

The government estimates the subsidy on this would be lower than what the procurement-based price support system costs. It could cast its net farther, since the present system covers a limited number of crops in some states.

Economist Abhijit Sen points out some of the possible pitfalls. Can this effort, an effort to delink subsidies from prices, be a substitute for a minimum support price system which was ensuring production incentives?

If insurers take decisions on a certain market price and average yield, this may reduce the scope for manipulation and information requirement but may leave open the question of assessing the area under a particular crop. Would a large subsidy element then be sustainable? Such a scheme, he says, is bound to breed corruption.

16,Money extorted from traders in the name of elections,"LUCKNOW: Come university election time and the extortion racket carried out by the student leaders turned don peaks. Friday saw a delegation of Lucknow Vyapar Mandal who met the district police chief Rajiv Ranjan Verma and registered their resentment for being repeatedly harassed by University students.

The students they alleged were extorting money from them in the name of union elections slated for Saturday. The traders unanimously demanded police protection and stern action against all those who were threatening them of dire consequences.

The delegation of traders complained to the official that similar threats were being received by traders of Hazratganj, Daliganj, Mahanagar, Chowk and other markets. The traders also apprised the official that a group of Alambagh traders had even managed to nab one of the extorters and handed him over to the Alambagh Police Station. But since then those very traders were receiving anonymous threatening phone calls.

Verma has assured the traders to provide security and take authoritative action against the mischief makers.

Speculations are rife with news that now another famous reel life personality turned real life politician, Samajwadi Party, MP, Raj Babbar will take over the post.

While Sinha has categorically stated in his letter that ''preoccupation with ministerial work'' is the reason for the resignation but it is believed that the decision so soon after the change in guard in UP politics is no coincidence.

During his tenure Sinha was instrumental in attracting many of the Bollywood glitterati to UP but this failed to provide the much needed impetus to UP''s film making aspirations.

Executive director of Film Bandhu and member secretary of FDC has however denied all rumours and said that he had no information on who would be appointed the new director.

The Bhasa Shahid Smarak Samiti said in a statement that Bengali was still not being used as the official language in government offices and police stations, despite repeated promises by the state government.
