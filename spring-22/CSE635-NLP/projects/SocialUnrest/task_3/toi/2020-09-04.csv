1,Bypoll to mark change in Kerala politics: BJP,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The BJP in Kerala has taken the Sept 23 Lok Sabha bypoll in Ernakulam as a chance to expose the ''Congress-CPI (M) nexus'' by backing the CPI-M dissident V Viswanatha Menon, who had entered the fray as an independent against the UDF and the LDF, state BJP president P S Sreedharan Pillai said on Monday.

""Ernakulam by-election marks the beginning of a radical political change in Kerala. We take it very seriously,"" Pillai told a press meet here.

""So far the BJP in the state has fought elections as a ritual. This time we are going to take it very seriously,"" he said.

The BJP leader wanted the CPI-M and Congress leaderships to spell out clearly what sort of tie-up the two parties were having at the national level to fight the BJP.

""Last month the CPI-M central leaders said that they will back the Congress chief Sonia Gandhi as prime ministerial candidate after the next elections. CPI-M politburo member Prakash Karat said in Chennai the other day that his party will not enter into alliance with the Congress.

""The party owes a clarification whether these shifting views are the result of the policy change or a ploy to hoodwink the people in view of the Ernakulam by-poll,"" he said.

2,Ryots protest release of Srisailam water,"KURNOOL: Hundreds of farmers, led by former MLA D L Ravindra Reddy, blocked the Kurnool-Chittoor national highway at Maidukuru in Kadapa district for more than three hours on Thursday in protest against the release of water from the Srisailam reservoir.

Farmers of Nandyal, led by municipal chairman S P Y Reddy, have decided to lay siege to the reservoir on Sunday.

Genco authorities began generation of power at the Srisailam left bank underground power house on Wednesday, although chief minister Chandrababu Naidu assured TDP leaders and the allparty delegation that water would not be released till September 15.

Contrary to the CMâ€™s assurance, the authorities released over 15,000 cusecs of water from the reservoir for more than six hours on Wednesday and five hours on Thursday to facilitate Genco to run two units of the second powerhouse.

Genco authorities claimed on Thursday they have begun generating power at the Srisailam left bank powerhouse only during peak load hours to avoid burden on the grid.

Farmers at a meeting held in Nandyal on Thursday decided to lay siege to the powerhouse on Sunday, demanding an end to power generation. Nandyal municipal chairman S P Y Reddy announced that hundreds of farmers would go to Pothireddypadu head regulator on Friday along with 20 earth movers and offer to work on the approach channel.

Meanwhile, S P Y Reddy resigned from the post of municipal chairman late in the evening stating that the CM did not live up to his promise. It may recalled that Reddy withdrew his decision to resign after the CM promised to stop release of water from the Srisailam reservoir. Farmers from Banaganapalli, Koilakuntla, Allagadda and Nandyal areas attended the meeting.

3,UDF starts campaign for by-election,"KOCHI: Congress-led UDF in Kerala on Thursday began its campaign for the September 23 by-election to the Ernakulam Lok Sabha constituency, even as a sulking K Karunakaran and his son and KPCC president, K Muraleedharan, minced no words in expressing their displeasure over the selection of party candidate M O John, a loyalist of Chief Minister A K Antony.

The workers of Karunakaran''s ''I'' faction kept a low profile in today''s party convention at Kochi. Though some of the faction leaders did participate in the meeting, ministers- Kadavoor Sivadasan and P Sankaran, were conspicuous by their absence.

The ''I'' faction is reportedly meeting here tonight to discuss its future plans.

While Karunakaran told reporters at Thiruvananthapuram that high command decision''s to field John overlooking his faction''s sentiments was ''painful'' and would harm the party''s prospects, Muraleedharan told reporters at Kochi that he was the ""next target in the agenda"" of the anti-Karunakaran faction in the state congress.

Muraleedharan, however, said he would neither resign on his own nor take ''political sanyas''.

The ''I'' faction is holding a convention at Kochi on September 6 in memory of George Eden, whose death necessitated the by-election.

Meanwhile, a petition, seeking quashing of the election notification, was dismissed by Kerala High Court.

4,City teachers court arrest to ‘save education’,"MUMBAI: When Avaneesh Bhatt (30) decided to become an English literature teacher, he never imagined that he would court arrest on the eve of Teachersâ€™ Day.

Yet, on Thursday, the Jai Hind college lecturer was among 200 other teachers getting into a police van at Azad Maidan to protest the state governmentâ€™s â€œanti-educationâ€™â€™ policies.

Courting arrest may be a symbolic gesture, but Mr Bhattâ€™s problems are for real. He was employed at Jai Hind College in June on a temporary basis. However, in July the state government issued a resolution stating that new teachers would be appointed only on a contractual basis.

As a result, Mr Bhatt,who has a six-year teaching experience and has cleared the mandatory National Eligibility Test (NET), now receives a m o n t h l y salary of Rs 8,000. This is less than half the salary stipulated by the Fifth Pay Commission.

In addition, contractual teachers get no pay during the vacations and have no job security as contracts have to be renewed every year. â€œWith this salary, I can barely afford the rent of my one-room-kitchen apartment in Andheri,â€™â€™ Mr Bhatt rued. â€œAt this rate, no sane girl will ever agree to marry me.â€™â€™

His colleague, Uddhav Zarekar, who is also a contractual teacher, has a wife and a daughter to support. The fate of 28 teachers of Mithibai college, Vile Parle, is worse. Employed on a clock-hour basis, these teachers are paid Rs 75 per lecture.

Once again, they get no salary during the vacations and can be asked to stop their lectures at any time. â€œIt is a sad situation that the tribe of teachers without any job security is only growing by the day,â€™â€™Mr Bhatt said.

â€œOn a day when the nation honours academicians, we teachers have very little to celebrate,â€™â€™ said Bombay University College Teachersâ€™ Union general secretary Tapati Mukhopadhyay.

Thursdayâ€™s â€˜jail-bharo andolanâ€™ is part of the teachersâ€™ campaign to improve education. Coming together under the banner of the Coordination Committee of Teachersâ€™ Organisations, Bombay, teachers from kindergarten to post-graduate levels submitted a memorandum to the state government on Thursday.

Their demands include scrapping the contractual system, regularising all present appointments and increasing government funding of education.

â€œThe government cannot give up its responsibility of funding education,â€™â€™ professor K.K. Theckedath said, adding that grants to schools and colleges should be resumed.

The teachers are also protesting the increase in fees for various courses. In addition to the rising fees for engineering and medical courses, colleges had increased the fees for regular arts, science and commerce courses as well, teachers said.

This had not even been followed by a commensurate increase in infrastructural facilities for students, the committee said. The academicians also criticised August 2003 SC judgment that took away state employeesâ€™ right to strike work.

6,Boparai blames govt for varsity crisis,"PATIALA: Punjabi University vice-chancellor SS Boparai has blamed the Punjab Government for the trouble in the university over the fee hike.

Addressing a meeting of senior university officers and department heads on Thursday, Boparai said first the government announced the fee hike without consulting the universities, and then decided to revise the fee structure again.

He said the Punjabi University followed the government''s decision and printed prospectuses listing the hiked fee structure.

The students took admissions without raising any objection. But then the government rolled back its decision without giving any direction to the universities.

Despite repeated efforts to get clarification, the government did not bother and under these circumstances the university could do nothing, he added.

Boparai, who broke his silence for the first time after the announcement of government''s decision to partially roll back the hike, claimed, ""We have won the fight.""

He said the government wanted a complete roll back, but the university succeeded in maintaining at least half of the hiked fee.

The vice-chancellor said they had identified the outsiders who provoked the students'' strike, and had informed the government about them.

Declaring the end of the era of leniency, Boparai asked the teachers to maintain their dignity, status, prestige and ensure punctuality and discipline.

He directed them to ensure that students attend classes and asked them to submit internal assessment details on time.

He said if the teaching community would take any stand, he would fight for it. Boparai also clarified that examinations would be held on time.

The V-C warned the ''unwanted advisors'' against giving him suggestions and said all decisions were taken after due consultations with heads and deans.

The VC, in his two hours meeting, made it clear that he would not bow down and would move ahead with his stand.

He also said that the teaching staff should perform their duties and if someone stopped them from entering the university, they should submit a complaint.

The university has decided to resume classes in two phases-with departments with less students to begin classes first.

If the students maintain calm, other departments would be opened then.

7,Gujarat govt to bear Surjan's treatment expenses,"AHMEDABAD: The family member of comatose commando Surjan Singh Bhandari, injured in the Akshardham temple attack on September 24 last year, wants Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi to assure that the expenses for his treatment would be borne by his government even after he is shifted to New Delhi by the National Security Guards.

Following this, the Gujarat government sent an official communiquÃ© to the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital that it would bear the expenses. Uttam Singh Bhandari, one of Surjan''s brother, had faxed a letter to Modi in this regard, family sources said. Surjan, who was decorated with the Kirti Chakra, is still ""critical and on lifesupport system"" at the ICCU of the civil hospital since he was admitted nearly a year ago after being wounded during crossfire with the militants.

When contacted, civil hospital superintendent Anil Chaddha told TNN, ""Whichever hospital he will be shifted to, the Gujarat government will bear the expenses of his treatment and the cost of shifting him. And, a team of doctors and paramedical staff would also accompany him to Delhi.""

Top brass of NSG are making arrangements to shift him to Delhi. Surjan''s other brother Surjeet told TNN, ""We have thanked the Modi government for the move."" This was stated in a letter faxed by Uttam Singh to the chief minister''s office which also sought assurance of the ""bearing of expenses for his treatment by the Gujarat government after shifting him to New Delhi"".

When contacted, an official of the CM office confirmed that they had received the fax sent by the commando''s brother.

8,MLA resents govt decision,"PATNA: The recent decision of the state government amounting to curtailment of rights of ministers and legislators and the state assembly, as they feel, has raised their eyebrows.

The government recently decided that ministers cannot give any assurance on questions of public interest or on call attention in the House, and if at all they have to give, then it has to be first approved by the departmental commissioner and secretary.

Talking to mediapersons here on Thursday, CPI(ML-New Democracy) MLA Umadhar Prasad Singh said that the government''s decision was violative of norms laid by the country''s Constitution.

According to him, the bureaucracy, which had been making efforts to get the decision passed by the government for the last two years, had finally succeeded in suppressing powers given to MLAs.

He said when he raised the issue in the assembly, referring to such a step initiated by the then parliamentary affair secretary Girish Shankar, then the minister had given a misleading answer on the floor of the House.

9,HC rulings show govt in poor light,"PATNA: The series of decisions taken by the Patna High Court has led to strindent criticism of the Rabri government. There is a growing impression that it is the court which is forcing the state government to take decisions which the latter should have taken on its own.

Within the last one month, the high court has directed the government to transfer police officers who have completed their term at one place, extended the tenure of mayors to five years, directed the removal of a few officers on key posts, fined a district magistrate for suspending an employee and even directed tthe governor to intervene in the functioning of the state government.

""It is not a monarchy. The government has to run under certain laws. Since the laws of the land are not being implemented, the court is intervening. I shall not be surprised if the court asks the Centre to impose President''s rule in the state"", remarked rebel Samata Party MLC P K Sinha.

The Patna High Court has evaluated the functioning of this government and declared it as having failed, said state BJP chief Nand Kishore Yadav.

He remarked that over one dozen adverse remarks were made by the high court within a span of one month, indicating that the Rabri Devi government lacked the will to govern the state.

Yadav stated that most of the work in public interest is being done at the behest of the court -- right from giving pensions to promotions to transfers of government employees. ""There are 4,610 contempt cases against the state government in the court,"" he added, insisting that the adverse comments of the court have failed to wake up the government from deep slumber.

On August 6, the high court remarked that no citizen of the state feels safe. It used the word ""goonda raj"" and ""jungle raj"" in its observations. It has also pulled up the state government for failing to provide citizens basic civic amenities like pure drinking water and cleanliness, and removing encroachments. It has repeatedly used harsh terms to describe the failure of the state government to give powers to panchayati raj institutions.

The question remains what is the justification for a jumbo ministry if the court is to take decisions on its behalf.

Currently, the SLKA is situated in the Lal Baradari Bhawan at Kaiserbagh. The building, which is more than 100 years old, is being maintained by the State Archaeology as a protected monument.

Two years ago, SLKA was given land next to the UP Sangeet Natak Academy in Gomtinagar to construct a permanent building and a modern art gallery.

15,"Girl tortured by in-laws, cheated by husband","AMBALA: ""I had been physically and mentally tortured by my in-laws for not bringing more dowry and even beaten mercilessly a number of times"", Dimple, a girl victimised by her in-laws and cheated by her husband, said while narrating her story.

Talking to TNN, she said: ""My husband has ruined my life as he concealed the fact of his first marriage from my parents and me"".

Dimple, a resident of Ludhiana, now-a-days living with her maternal uncle in Ambala, has written letters to Union Defence Minister and Human Rights Commission, alleging that a Sepoy Gurcharan Singh has cheated her by hiding the fact that he was already married with Sonia Devi.

Dimple got married with Gurcharan Singh on May 8, 2002 under Hindu Marriage rites. She stated in the letter that since the parents of Gurcharan were not alive, so he kept her with his sister at Ludhiana. Though she continuously pleaded her husband to take her along with him, he refused to do so. She alleged that her sister-in-law used to treat her like a maid servant, always abusing her and also had beaten her a number of times.

She said that her husband hardly came to meet her at his sister''s place and when she demanded some money to look after her, he never gave her.

She said that when the water went above her nose she complained about the maltreatment by her sister-in-law to her father, Ramesh Kumar. Her father brought her back to his house, she added.

In a letter written to the Commanding Officer of the Battalion, she has stated that at the time of marriage her husband had promised her that he would arrange a separate house for her. Moreover she was not given a single penny to look after herself.

She requested the Commanding Officer to ask her husband to send her maintenance allowance as per rules.

But the Commanding Officers reply stunned Dimple. It said that her husband was already married with Sonia Devi as per their records and the army authorities had been remitting a maintenance allowance to her.

Dimple lost her mother around two years back and her father too is suffering from loss of 80 per cent eyesight. There was no one to look after her, because of no source of income.

Ramesh, Dimple''s father, sent her to her uncle at Ambala.

Dimple alleged that since she had left her sister-inâ€“law''s house, but her father and other relatives from the parents'' side were getting continuous threats from her in-laws to send her back or face dire consequences.

The uncle of Dimple, Dr R P Sharma, said that he would take up this matter with the police. He said that he would personally visit the senior officers of Army taking Dimple along to seek necessary action against the Sepoy who had spoiled the life of a girl.

He said that these kinds of incidents were really shameful on the part of such people, who did not care about the life of another human being. Moreover it was sadder when a Sepoy by doing so was tarnishing image of army personnel.

Dimple strongly dismissed the idea of going back to her husband. She said that her life was already ruined and now she found no future ahead with that man.

16,NIC 3rd party health insurance a loss-maker: CMD,"KOLKATA: The domestic health insurance business has huge potential in India provided it is monitored properly, H S Wadhwa, chairman cum managing director (CMD) of the National Insurance Co Ltd (NIC), said in Kolkata on Friday.

However, according to him, the third party portfolio of health insurance is resulting in huge losses to the industry especially to the companies in the public sector. â€œThe losses are estimated to be as high as Rs 2,500 crore,â€� he said.

He said that being a PSU entity, companies like NIC have to bear certain social obligations like difficulties in denial of coverage and they cannot restructure the premium rates. According to him, their private sector counterparts can afford to avoid these obligations.

The NIC chief also said that there is no time or jurisdiction limitation in India and these are beyond the proper administration of the companies.

He elaborated by saying that certain cases are filed after a couple of years and even there are cases which are registered in a different locations â€œWe, on behalf of the PSU players, have made several representations to the IRDA as it is eating into our bottomlines,â€� he said.

Incidentally, NIC third-party (TP) premium income in this sector during the last fiscal was Rs 441 crore while the outgo was almost 176 per cent of its premium income or Rs 776 crore.

17,BJP panel to probe Virbhadra govt's misdoings,"SHIMLA: State BJP spokesman Baldev Sharma on Friday said that the party had formed a three-member committee headed by Ravinder Ravi, which would gather all instances of the government headed by Virbhadra Singh giving a go-by to set rules and regulations in its functioning.

Talking to newspersons here, he said that the commitee would be keeping a watch over all such incidents and also on the employees who were functioning as agents of the Congress and the government. The party would later decide what course of action should be adopted in such matters, he added.

He said that he had also filed an affidavit and sent it to the chief justice of the Himachal high court, stating that the CBI was not taking any action on a matter pertaining to land scam by the present chief minister, because of the latter''s influence and help by a caucus of officers in the country''s premier investigating agency.

Sharma claimed that he had apprehended that the prosecution would not be honest in its task in the Sagar katha case, currently being heard in the Himachal High Court, which turned out to be true in the hearing on August 30, where it tried to demolish its own case. ""It proved that the prosecution is under pressure not to work properly,"" he alleged.

He also accused the Shimla district administration of not acting impartially in the matter relating to excess land being held by Virbhadra, as it had not taken steps to take posession of the land, which too had been apprehended by the state unit of the BJP.

""The present affidavit relates to a matter referred to the CBI in 1998 in which some action was taken, but later a report was sent stating that on the strength of the documents available the matter could not be pursued further. Later, the then government retraced the required documents and informed the CBI that all documents were now available but nothing transpired,"" he claimed.

The BJP spokesman said that he had he sent a reminder to the Director CBI in June this year informing the latter of the intentional inaction on the part of the country''s premier investigating agency, but as he had not heard anything in the matter, he has asked the chief justice of the Himachal High Court to take up the matter and direct the CBI to proceed impartially in the case.

""When some documents with an affidavit are given, it is binding for the CBI to take action on them. As such under the present circumstances, the situation demands that the entire matter be handed over to the CBI and be monitored by the Himachal High Court,"" he added.

On the goings-on in the Himachal Pradesh University, Sharma said that it was during the earlier tenure of the Congress government, when Virbhadra was the chief minister then also, the government took away the powers of the senate, the highest body of the Univesrity and gave it to the executive council. If this had not been done then, the autonomy of the University would have remained, he clarified.

18,Curfew in Godhra after clashes,"VADODARA: Eight persons, including policemen, were injured in communal violence in Godhra town, 80 km from here, on Friday evening. Curfew was imposed in five police chowky areas along the route of the Ganesh immersion procession, even as police opened fire and lobbed tear-gas shells to disperse stone-pelting mobs.

It appears part of the trouble began with inflammatory slogans being raised by the processionists while passing through areas inhabited by Muslims. Police say both communities claim the stoning began from the other side.

Five citizens and three policemen, including a deputy superintendent, were injured in the rioting. A journalist is also said to be among those injured, while one person hit by a tear-gas shell was badly wounded and was sent to Vadodara for further treatment. Around 30 tear-gas shells were fired.

Arson was reported from the sensitive railway station area, where the notorious train carnage on February 27 last year had unleashed a wave of reprisals all across Gujarat. Though the police were on high alert, since all the Ganapati idols (86 of them) were to be immersed on Friday, also the day of Muslim prayers, curfew still had to be imposed to control the situation, with tear-gas shells failing to stop stone-pelting. A railway police sub-inspector fired four rounds in the air when a mob collected near the railway station and resorted to violence.

â€˜â€˜Trouble started near the Rani Masjid area of Polan Bazar, when the 51st Ganapati idol was on its way for immersion,â€™â€™ said Spl IG (Vadodara range) Rakesh Asthana. The police are not sure how it started, since both Hindu and Muslim groups have claimed the other started the stone-pelting, he added.

20,BJP demands CM's resignation over farmers death,"MYSORE: Opposition leader in the state legislative council D.H.Shankermurthy on Friday said Krishna should quit his post owning moral responsibility for the large scale farmers deaths in the state.

At a press meet here, reminding state Congress leaders of Sonia Gandhi''s he said five years back Sonia Gandhi has demanded the resignation of then chief minister J.H. Patel following a suicide of a lone farmer in Hubli taluk. Now when hundreds of farmers have died and are dying , not only Congress leaders who have heard of Sonia''s demand , even she herself is maintaining stoic silence on the deaths, he said adding that this indicated the Congress leaders scant respect for the farmers life .

""Congress government led by Krishna has no moral right to continue in the office even for a single minute"" he felt alleging the state government''s total failure on the farmers front.

Referring to the package announced for the farmers, Shankermurthy termed it as an "" eye wash"" and said in reality it has no implications on the farmers real life. "" Eevery thing announced is illusory and a paperwork with no realistic benefits"" he added.

Recollecting Karim Lala''s stamp paper scandal, BJP leader said despite hue and cry raised by the BJP and exposing the scandal, Krishna is not serious in his effort to nail down the culprits and punish them. "" Out party is determined to raise such issues and will not sit quiet till the guilty are punished and conspirators and abettors in the scandal are exposed.

Shankermurthy said the recent excavations at Ayodhya and findings of the experts have vindicated the BJP stand on temple issue.

"" Now it time for all the concerned to allow the people to build the Ram temple at Ayodhya"" he said.

21,Lawyers to be morally responsibility to society: HC judge,"BANGALORE: Karnataka High Court judge and Executive Chairman of Karnataka State Legal Services Authority, Justice R.V. Raveendran said that most law students who enter the legal profession are not aware of ground realities. A law student will come to know about realities of the existing society only when he comes in contact with people and where the basic principles of the noble profession need to be adopted, he added.

Speaking at the inaugural of a free legal aid cell at Seshadripuram Law College, Justice Raveendran said though the institution of law and lawyers hold moral responsibility towards service to the society, it had become commercialised. Education has become rather commercialised than based on moral principles and the legal profession more a means of livelihood often neglecting the cause, he added.

Students should break out of this shell and take up social causes as merely studying will not help them become good lawyers. Justice Raveendran said that in a country where illiterates are more and people are not aware of their rights, it is the duty of the law students and lawyers to bring about legal awareness. ""They should reach out to rural areas and provide free legal aid as it is an opportunity for them (law students) to come in contact with factual circumstances,"" the judge said, adding that many people were aware of their rights but not duties and this is where the legal fraternity plays an important role.
