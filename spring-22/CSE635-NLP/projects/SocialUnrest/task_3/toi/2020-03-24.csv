0,Board exams begin on Tuesday with stricter rules,"AHMEDABAD: When standard X and XII students sit down for their board exams from Tuesday, they will have more to contend with, than just the pressure of passing. To start with, this is the first exam in which the Gujarat Secondary Education Board (GSEB) has raised the bar of passing from 35 to 40 per cent for standard X students.

If that was not enough, the Board has announced stricter norms against copying, even severe action against teachers helping students copy. Add to this the fact that a large chunk of the students sitting for these exams have been mass promoted with lenient checking in the previous two years because the earthquake and the communal riots disrupting the academic process in the state.

â€œI would not be surprised if the board shows some leniency with grace marks this year as well,â€� says Aroma School principal and executive council member of GSEB Bhaskar Patel. â€œThose sitting for their SSC exams suffered the earthquake in standard VIII and the riots the year after that, while those sitting for the HSC exam suffered the same fate while in their SSC. This means many of the students have not gone through the rigours of normal schooling and may not be prepared for the test this year.â€�

Nidhi Mehta, an SSC student is very tense. â€œWith the minimum pass percentage raised to 40 per cent, I feel very tense,â€� she says. â€œWhile I get good marks in most other papers, I barely scrape through in maths. With the new rule, I will have to work extra hard.â€�

And work hard they will have to considering that GSEB is cracking down hard on students who copy and supervisors who help them copy. â€œEspecially in the villages, supervisors and conductors are under pressure to turn a blind eye while students sit for the exam with textbooks,â€� says general secretary of the Gujarat State School Principalsâ€™ Association Jitubhai Shah.

1,"Build confidence, Dhumal tells govt","SHIMLA: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in the Himachal assembly Prem Kumar Dhumal asked the government to face the harsh realities, as far as the financial health of the state was concerned, and rather than accusing others, try to resolve the issue by taking the opposition into confidence.

Initiating the discussion on the motion of thanks to the Governorâ€™s address in the Vidhan Sabha on Monday, he said that as head of the previous BJP government in the state, he had placed a white paper on the floor of the House on the financial health of the state, in which no one was blamed, but efforts were made to seek the cooperation of all in adopting the remedies that had been proposed and suggestions had also been invited.

He said that it was rather surprising that even the governor was given a false picture on the total loan liability of the state.

â€œThe governor in his speech spoke in terms of a loan liability of Rs 15,000 crore, which in reality as on December end last year was Rs 11,400 crore,â€� he added.

Dhumal said that when his government took office in March 1998, the state had an accumulated loan liability of Rs 4966.91 crore, which meant that it had only raised loans totalling about Rs 6440 crore; besides it had also repaid loans taken by the earlier Congress governments in the state at exorbitant rate of interest.

He said the user charges in hospitals for which the Congress members had in the past come out strongly against his government, had not been removed so far by the Congress government. â€œIncidentally, the user charges were first imposed by the Congress in 1975-76 and later twice by subsequent Congress governments, and the previous BJP government had only removed government control of the funds so accumulated,â€� he added.

The BJP leader said that law and order situation in the state did not find any mention in the governorâ€™s address and it was even more surprising that only yesterday 400 labourers had been rendered homeless after their 100 â€œjhuggisâ€� had been burnt by some people. These, he said, were reasons for which he could not support the motion.

â€œI would like to appeal to the government not only to provide relief and succour to the labourers who had been rendered homeless, but also to ensure that they get justice and find out reasons as to why their â€œjhuggisâ€� were burnt,â€� the former chief minister added. Earlier moving the motion, Harsh Vardhan (Congress) came out strongly against the previous BJP government in the state for lodging criminal cases against chief minister Virbhadra Singh and trying to tarnish his image in one way or the other.

2,Who are political bedfellows?,"BANGALORE: Is the BJP closer to the Congress than the Janata Parivar? The question caused some lighter moments in the Assembly on Monday. Araga Jnanendra (BJP) said: â€œYou have been dependent on the Centre for developmental work. If there had been no drought, foodgrains also wouldnâ€™t have come.â€™â€™

Law minister D.B. Chandre Gowda intervened to say: â€œWhy do you keep saying the Centre is yours? Isnâ€™t it the government for the entire country?â€™â€™ At this, K. Jayaprakash Hegde (Ind) recalled social welfare minister A. Krishnappaâ€™s statement that BJP MLAs were knocking on the Congressâ€™ doors. â€œIs the distance between the two of you lessening, I wonder,â€™â€™ he asked.

Home minister Mallikarjun Kharge shot up to say: â€œThe distance between you all (Parivar) and us is much lesser. The BJP and we are far apart.â€™â€™ â€˜Devotionalâ€™ row: Is devotion innate or is it an expression of weakness?

3,Anti-drug rally in Bathinda,"BATHINDA: A large number of youths on Monday undertook a rally against drug abuse by wearing placards around their necks with slogans against the menace. The rally was organised by Sahara Jan Sewa, a voluntary organisation here, with the cooperation of district health authorities.

The motive of the rally was to make the youths, who were most vulnerable to the menace, aware about the ruinous affects of drugs, said Vijay Goel, chairman of Sahara Jan Sewa. â€˜â€˜If peer-group pressure is the major reason for pushing the youths in morass of drugs, it could also be a potent weapon against the disease,'''' said Goel while explaining the reason for involving more and more youths in a crusade against drug-addiction.

The organisation had also organised a function on Sunday to commemorate the martyrdom of Shaeed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh and to infuse the spirit of nationalism among youths. Ziladar held for accepting bribe: The Bathinda vigilance department has arrested a ziladar for allegedly accepting Rs 2,500 as bribe from a farmer to decide a case on Monday.

B S Grewal, SP (vigilance), Bathinda, said that the accused, Balwinder Singh, was posted at Jaito town of Faridkot and received a bribe of Rs 2,500 from Iqbal Singh of Kotbhai village for arranging canal water for his field.

4,Budget reeks of political expediency,"CHANDIGARH: The stamp of political expediency was embossed all over the Punjab budget presented in the state assembly on Monday as finance minister Lal Singh undid some of the proposals that he and his mandarins had come up with in last yearâ€™s budget.

In fact the 2003-04 budget makes nonsense of the 2002-03 budget. Many reform minded steps were announced with much fanfare in the last budget and their â€˜â€˜implementationâ€™â€™ announced in the action taken report (ATR) this year.

Yet the finance minister undid many proposals already implemented and chose to remain silent on glaring failures.

Two examples illustrate this. Point number five in the ATR states that LTC facility for employees was suspended up to March 31 2003. Yet in this yearâ€™s budget the minister restored it again. The justification is that fiscal situation in the state has â€˜improved.â€™ With 88 per cent of the revenue receipts for 2003-04 estimated to go towards payment of salaries, pension and interest, one wonders where is the â€˜improvementâ€™ in the fiscal situation. On the fast track disinvestment of five PSUs mentioned in the ATR, the minister did not disclose that the disinvestment of PUNCOM had failed and it remains to be seen how the process will be completed shortly.

Most of the budget proposals seek to placate some lobby or the other in the state even as lip service was paid to fiscal and economic reforms.

In the face of strong opposition from farmers in the state, the four per cent sales tax on fertilisers was abolished. Purchase tax on milk has been reduced from four per cent to two per cent, something that will certainly brighten the faces of (private!) milk plant owners in the state.

The budget also proposes to dispose of all pending cases against â€˜kacha arhtiyas,â€™ another politically well-connected lobby in the state, under the summary assessment scheme without calling them to the assessing authority.

Like the Union budget that has â€˜â€˜something for everyone,â€™â€™ the Punjab budget, too, has sops for all lobbies in the state: farmers, traders, government employees, industrialists but one wonders where are the tough steps that are badly needed to put the economy back on the rails?

Perhaps the present government came in at the wrong time. Parliamentary elections are due next year; by that time the government would have completed two-and-a-half years and assembly elections would be on the horizon. With the economic priorities out of sync with the political cycle, it remains to be seen where is Punjabâ€™s economy headed.

5,Please-farmer budget to tax telephone users,"CHANDIGARH: Taking a leaf out of the Union Budget, the Punjab government too presented a soft budget even as the total debt of the state is expected to shoot up to a staggering Rs 42,055 crore in the coming financial year.

Presenting the Rs 5319-crore fiscal deficit budget for 2003-2004 in the Vidhan Sabha on Monday, finance minister Lal Singh offered revenue concessions worth Rs 90 crore to farmers, employees and traders, but proposed to levy user charges for different services in a phased manner and introduce a new tax on telephone rentals.

Tax at the rate of 12.5 per cent would be levied on telephone rentals charged by the BSNL, private telephone companies, including cellphone service providers. It is expected to fetch the state around Rs 100 crore.

An annual plan for 2003-04 is proposed at Rs 3,200 crore against the available resources of Rs 2,517.40 crore, thereby leaving a deficit of Rs 682.60 crore which would be met by generation of additional resources and compressing non-productive expenditure. The size of the annual plan 2002-03 was, however, fixed at Rs 2,793 crore, but due to financial constraints the actual expenditure stuck at Rs 2,428.03 crore, reflecting plan performance of 86.93 per cent.

Lal Singh said that while last year saw the state achieving a degree of fiscal stabilisation, this year the state proposes to launch a new initiative for development. While the state witnessed happy signs of fiscal consolidation with revenue deficit as percentage of gross domestic product coming down from 5.28 per cent in 2001-02 to 4.20 per cent in the outgoing financial year and 3.54 per cent in 2003-04, the finance minister said high debt stock, low tax GSDP ratio and high interest burden threatened to derail the improvement process.

Added to this is the virtual stagnant rate of growth which was clocked at 3.44 per cent in 2000-01 and 3.47 per cent in the subsequent year.

In a major sop to farmers, the government decided to do away with the sales tax on fertilisers which currently stood at four per cent, and reduce purchase tax on milk from four per cent to two per cent.

For disbursement of Rs 30 per quintal bonus on sale of paddy during 2001-2002, the government has earmarked Rs 275 crore to be released in two phases, while Rs 55 crore had been already released in the current financial year.

While the coercive process under section 37(A) of the Punjab Land Revenue Act for recovery of cooperative loans, under which farmers were arrested for non-payment of loans, would be dispensed with, the government also slashed the rate of interest on cooperative loans from 13.5 per cent to 13 per cent.

In order to placate government employees, the budget proposes to restore LTC facility to them from April. The government has also decided to abolish octroi from July and substitute it with the local area development tax at the rate of two per cent on all goods coming from outside the state. In order to dispose of pending cases of tax disputes, the government would launch â€˜â€˜self-assessment scheme''''.

The minister said it would help clear more than one lakh cases pending upto March 31, 2002, and fetch Rs 10 crore as revenue. Relief provided by the Centre to exporters in the form of exim scrip, replenishment licence and duty entitlement pass book would be exempted from payment of sales tax.

6,Ram sevaks to court arrest in Delhi,"LUCKNOW: With their Ram temple movement entering into final phase, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) is gearing up to fill the Parliament Street with Ram sevaks in New Delhi during their week-long satyagrah programme, beginning March 27.

The VHP and its associate organisations are planning a massive congregation of its cadre in New Delhi to mount pressure on the Central government for framing a legislation to hand over the disputed land to Ram Janambhoomi Nyas for construction of the Ram temple.

About 11 lakh Ram sevaks, including one lakh from Uttar Pradesh, will court arrest during their week-long protest in Delhi. â€œAbout 40,000-50,000 Ram sevaks will participate in the demonstration daily,â€� claimed the VHP UP and Uttaranchal incharge Purshottam Narain Singh.

The VHP also plans to take pledge from about one crore Hindus all over the country by asking them to sign a one-page â€˜Sankalp Patraâ€™.

The sankalp patra is a pledge from Hindus to participate in the final phase of the movement and follow the directives of the VHP for construction of the temple.

If the VHP protest failed to extract anything from the Central government, the organisation may hold an emergency session of 185-member Marg Darshak Mandal, the highest decision-making body, to chalk out its strategy.

â€œIt was the last Dharam Sansad which authorised the Marg Darshak Mandal to announce the date for the temple construction. We hope that the Supreme Court judgment will come before April 2 and the Central government will take a decision to hand over the land to us or, else, we will forced to take some decision having far-reaching consequences,â€� warns the VHP leader.

The VHP leader claimed that the temple movement had entered into final phase and the time had come to take a decision with regard to beginning the construction of the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya.

7,HC will rule on which 'Kanhaiyya' is real McCoy,"MUMBAI: In what could be representative of an underdog''s fight against the might and malpractice of big channels, a rookie production company has taken Zee Network to court alleging that the latter had appropriated its idea for a serial.

Offering a brief respite to the production company, the Bombay high court has withheld permission to Zee to telecast ''Kanhaiyya'', the serial in question, till Tuesday.

Sundial Communications claims the serial had been lifted from its original idea of 52-episode serial called ''Krish Kanhaiyya''.

About the parallel in the theme of the two concerned serials, the court observed, There is no doubt that the theme is not identical. The question is whether it is similar in material aspects... The common feature is clearly a troubled family and the fact that the child form of Lord Krishna enters the life of the family and becomes a succour to the family.''''

Sundial registered the serial''s concept with the Film Writers Association in 2002 and approached leading channels to sell its serial. The court was told the court that the pilot episode was shown to Zee on October 10, and that Zee gave the first offer of Rs 2 lakhs. Since the budget of the serial was Rs 2.9 lakhs, the producers dithered, even as Zee reportedly raised the bid to Rs 2.4 lakhs.

In the meanwhile, Sony made a substantially higher offer and Sundial signed an agreement on February 20. However, from February 24, Zee started a full-fledged campaign with hoardings announcing the arrival of ''Kanhaiyya'', only this been made by Gulshan Sachdev of Film and Shot productions.

Sundial filed a suit on February 28 alleging copyright violation. On March 7, Justice S.A. Bobde passed an adinterim injunction on the Zee show, restraining telecast and the March 9 launch episode.

Zee then moved a division bench comprising Justice A.P. Shah and Justice D.K. Deshmukh and got a stay on the injunction, allowing it to screen the first episode on March 16.

The judges then watched episodes of both the serials on March 21 and in its latest order, the court vacated the stay on the injunction, restraining Zee from telecasting further episodes.

The bench found some obvious similarities. In both the versions the family is â€œrich and dysfunctional'''', the main woman protagonist prays for help to God and the prayer is answered by the arrival of Kanhaiya, the God is in the form of a child and the use of music is mythologically Krishna-centric.

â€œUndoubtedly there are some dissimilarities in the manner of presentation... They are not, however in my view, sufficient to hold that the theme as expressed in the work of the plaintiffs is entirely different from that of the defendants,'''' the judges observed.

The case, which could prove to be a watermark for copyright violation disputes in the entertainment industry dominated and often silenced by giants, comes up for the next hearing on Tuesday.

8,LJP assails NDA govt on Iraq war,"PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan, while criticising BJP-led Central government for its lackadaisical attitude in protesting Americaâ€™s attack on Iraq, on Monday demanded passing of condemnation motion in Parliament.

Speaking to mediapersons here at a press conference, Paswan said that his party will organise a grand rally in New Delhi on March 27 to oppose the war and Central governmentâ€™s policy on it and other matters. He said that todayâ€™s world is divided into two categories and 98 per cent people of the world are opposing the US decision. â€œStill Indian government has a soft corner for the America,â€� he said, adding, â€œhad it not been so, the government would have passed a resolution in Parliament condemning the attack on Iraq.

He said that his party would support the Bihar governmentâ€™s stand against war. â€œBut it doesnâ€™t mean that we are supporting the RJD-led government,â€� he said.â€œWe will not only oppose the war inflicted upon Iraq, but we will also oppose the policy of the BJP-led government in our rally,â€� Paswan said.

Reacting on the budget, he said there is nothing for the common masses in the budget and our party strongly protests it. Paswan demanded immediate ban on parties like Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh and Shiv Sena. â€œThese parties are spreading communalism in the country.â€�

9,"District, block Cong chiefs against prop to RJD-led govt","PATNA: The state convention of the Congress partyâ€™s block and district presidents at Sadaqat Ashram here on Monday saw the partymen expressing views against the partyâ€™s participation in the RJD-led state government.

The state Congress leadership had called the meeting as part of preparation for the national convention of block and district presidents. Congress president Sonia Gandhi will address them at the national convention on March 28 and 29 for strengthening the partyâ€™s organisational structure.

Several participants described before senior Congress leaders the practical difficulties they faced while replying to the queries of people in rural areas about different local issues. A block Congress president from Araria district satirically said, â€œIf the law and order situation in the state is good, we should support the RJD governmentâ€�.

The listeners included AICC secretaries V K Vasan and Chandan Bagchi, BPCC president Shakeel Ahmed, the Congress minister in RJD government, Vijay Shankar Dubey, and others. The party incharge for Bihar affairs, Oscar Fernandes, was conspicuous by his absence at the meet.

Ahmed tried to pacify the block and district presidents as he said that Sonia Gandhi would address the block and district presidents from all over the country in Delhi to chalk out a future programme with certain political strategies.

The block and district Congress presidents complained about RJD leadersâ€™ influence at block and district levels that had made the Congressmen feel they are second class politicians before the people.

10,Lok Adalats not to harm lawyers' interests: Judge,"KISHANGANJ: Justice Nagendra Rai of Patna High Court sought to dispel wrong notions in the minds of lawyers, who boycotted the formal inauguration of permanent Lok Adalat at Kishanganj on Sunday, that the existence of Lok Adalat would deprive them of cases.

He also said that Lok Adalats were created mainly to help the unprivileged in the society get quick redressal of their grievances and justice.

Rai, speaking as the chief guest at the glittering function at Town Hall here on Sunday after the formal inauguration, reminded the legal fraternity that altogether 2.84 crore cases were pending in the lower courts across the country and going at the present rate, it would take decades for their final disposal.

In this context, he said, the Bar Council of India, whose call led to lawyers abstaining from the function, was concerned since henceforth public utility cases to the tune of Rs 10 lakh would be taken up at Lok Adalat.

Rai said he was extremely delighted to know that the number of cases pending in the courts here was far too less.

Ghanshyam Prasad, member-secretary, Bihar State Legal Cell Authority, informed that hi-tech video conferencing system had already been introduced for the resolution and settlement of long-standing cases through interactive processes and said the very success of the concept of Lok Adalat was largely dependent upon legal awareness of the people.

He said more than 100 Legal Awareness camps had been organised in the remote villages of the state through participation of non-government organisations (NGOs) and over 600 Lok Adalats were held so far inside the jails across the state to meet the ends of justice for those languishing in jails.

During the last five years since the inception of Lok Adalat, over one lakh cases had been finally disposed off and during the current year, another one lakh cases are targeted to be disposed off, Prasad added.

District and sessions judge, Purnia, S C Jha, while welcoming the guests, besides, dispelling misconceptions that Lok Adalat was distortion of legal system, clarified that it, in fact, was a parallel institution of the legal system itself which actually intended to cut cumbersome and time-consuming legal system.

Kishanganj DM K Senthil Kumar said Lok Adalat was a boon in disguise for all those who could ill-afford prolonged delays in dispensation of justice in the courts.

Arun Kumar Singh, additional district judge, Kishanganj, proposed the vote of thanks.

12,District board members lash out at govt officials,"MUZAFFARPUR: The elected panchayat representatives and the district board members in Muzaffarpur and Vaishali districts are up in arms against the officials of health, education and other departments for their alleged laxity in executing schemes these days.

On Saturday, the district board members of Muzaffarpur at a meeting lashed out at the officials of health, agriculture, education and other departments for their lackadaisical attitude on development front.

According to sources in district board, civil surgeon of Muzaffarpur Dr Ram Yash Ram, the district forest officer, the district education officer and the district agriculture officer were vehemently grilled at the district board members for their laxity in toning-up the functioning of their respective departments.

Not only the district administration officials were grilled but local RJD MLA Vijendra Choudhary was also reportedly taken to task by the district board members for not being present in the meeting.

The miserable condition of primary education and the supply of infected seeds of maize to the farmers in Muzaffarpur were discussed by the members and the officials concerned were criticised for that. It is to be known that the seeds of maize supplied to the farmers in the district by a multinational company have failed to yield â€œcropsâ€�. For the supply of useless seeds of maize the district board members criticised the district agriculture officer, S K Choudhary. Later, the DDC, Shafina, assured the members to invite a team of the agriculture scientists from Rajendra Agriculture University, Pusa, to look into the failure of maize seeds.

State land reforms and revenue minister Ramai Ram also came under severe attack by district board members for not obtaining permission of the board before distributing â€œpurchasâ€� of land among landless people. The pramukhs of Muzaffarpur, however, stayed away from the meeting.

Earlier, the members of Vaishali district board had grilled several district officials for their failure in streamlining the functioning of their departments.

â€œThe CPM has resorted to terror tactics in these districts and people have been forced to run away from their houses. Our leaders appealed to the election commissioner to visit the districts and restore order for panchayat polls to be fair. The commissioner should also ensure that members of the state co-ordination committee, alone, do not get all election duty,â€� Roy said. According to Roy, the leaders also urged a reduction in the security deposits for panchayat candidates.

The state BJP chief also ignored what union minister of state for small scale industries and development of the North-Eastern Region Tapan Sikdar had said about the BJP-Trinamul alliance. â€œI donâ€™t know what he has said. What I am saying now is with authority and is the authentic version,â€� he said.

15,Oppn stalls House over farmers' issue,"HYDERABAD: The issue of some Congress legislators trying to barge into the chambers of chief minister Chandrababu Naidu in the Assembly on Saturday, was referred to the Ethics Committee by speaker K Prathiba Bharati.

The speaker announced her decision on Monday even as the proceedings of the House were stalled almost for the whole day by the Congress legislators who staged a walkout on the issue of payment of compensation to farmers who had committed suicide.

Along with the Congress, MIM and left-wing parties members also staged a walkout in protest against what they called the governmentâ€™s â€œindifferent attitude towards farmers.â€�

Pandemonium prevailed in the House since morning when the speaker disallowed adjournment motions sought to be moved by opposition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, Nomula Narasimhaiah (CPM) and Asaduddin Owaisi (MIM) demanding a discussion on the farmersâ€™ issues and the Saturday incident.

The Congress members displayed placards asking the government to announce a package similar to the one announced by the Karnataka government to farmers. The Karnataka government has announced a relief of Rs 1 lakh each to the families of farmers who had committed suicide.

The speaker did not allow the Congress partyâ€™s demand for a discussion and asked the members to make their submissions in another form.

Legislative affairs minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu intervened and stated that the government was ready to answer any query on farmersâ€™ issues.

The Congress members insisted on a discussion and the proceedings were stalled for more than two hours with the ruling and the opposition members trading charges against each other.

Ramakrishnudu demanded an apology from Rajasekhara Reddy for â€œcausing destruction to the Assembly propertyâ€� by his party MLAs on Saturday.

The CLP leader denied that he had stormed the chief ministerâ€™s chambers and said that he had tried to meet Naidu to request the government to pay ex gratia to farmers. He alleged that the security personnel and the chief marshal had prevented the Congress legislators from meeting Naidu and had manhandled journalists.

The chief minister insisted that order be restored so that he could make a statement. But, Congress members prevented him from speaking and rushed into the well of the House and squatted for more than 45 minutes.

Amidst sloganeering from both the sides, the House was adjourned for tea break. When the House reassembled, Chandrababu Naidu vented his ire at Rajasekhara Reddy. The chief minister hit out at the CLP leader for â€œencouraging rowdyism and criminalising politics.â€� The CLP leader, in turn, took potshots at Naidu.

18,Telecom consolidation gets governmental nod,"NEW DELHI: Government today paved the way for consolidation of telecom industry by allowing companies to merge, de-merge and acquire more companies but with certain conditions like roll out obligations of parent company to be transferred to the new entity.

Prior to any transfer of business the past dues of the companies towards government have to be cleared before transfer of licence was allowed, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told reporters after the Cabinet meeting here.

The transferee will, however, be liable for the dues arising after the date of transfer and therefore, the set-off clause would operate accordingly, Swaraj said.

Swaraj said there had been representations from telecom service industry seeking flexibility for restructuring of equity and amalgamation of telecom licensees. There was no clause in the licence offered to private telecom companies in 1994.

There are several instances where telecom service companies belonging to the same group are licensees for different services like Bharti Group companies and Reliance Group Companies which have licences for basic as well as cellular services under the same company.

19,Delhi govt not to implement VAT from April one,"NEW DELHI: Value Added Tax (VAT) system will not be implemented in Delhi from April one this year although the city government is not averse to its introduction, Finance Minister M S Saathi said today.

He told a press conference here that the city government would be assessing the impact of VAT in other states before implementing it here.

""The April one deadline is not for us. We are not going to implement VAT from this date,"" Saathi said pointing out that the matter was a state subject and a decision had to be taken by the city government.

He, however, maintained that it did amount to saying that ""we will not implement it.""

Earlier, while presenting Delhi Budget for the financial year 2003-04, Saathi told the House that the city government was ""in the process of making suitable modifications in the proposed legislation to see that VAT system is simple, trust-based and taxpayer-friendly.""

""We have to ensure that our revenues and trade interests are protected,"" he said.

21,BJP may move HC over panel selection,"PUNE: The BJP has threatened to move the Bombay High Court, challenging the appointment of â€œexpertsâ€� to the planning authority committee (PAC) formed for hearing citizensâ€™ suggestions and objections to the development plan (DP) for the 23 fringe villages.

The state urban development (UD) department had recently appointed four â€œexpertsâ€� â€” director of the School of Health Science at Pune University, Bhushan Patwardhan; director of the Centre for Development Studies and Activity Aneeta Benninger; former director of State Town Planning A.R. Patharkar; and noted architect Jagdish Godbole â€” to the PAC.

As per the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act (MR&TP) Act, the seven-member PAC comprises three members from the Pune municipal corporationâ€™s standing committee, besides the â€œexpertsâ€� appointed by the state government.

The ruling Congress-NCP combine has already appointed its three standing committee members â€” NCPâ€™s Kaka Chavan, and Dilip Tupe and Suresh Kadam of the Congress â€” to the PAC, notwithstanding the vehement protest from the opposition parties.

The composition of the PAC assumes special significance as the members will scrutinise and study suggestions and objections to the DP. As many as 65,000-odd citizens have objected to the DP, while some 20,000 have supported it.

The PAC is required to give a hearing to these citizens and table a report within the next two months, recommending the changes which the civic general body should carry out before finalising the DP.

The BJP had already objected to the appointment of the three Congress-NCP members, arguing that at least one of the three should had been from the BJP or the Shiv Sena.

Now, the BJP has also challenged the appointments of three â€œexpertsâ€�, barring that of Patwardhan.

A group of BJP corporators led by Ujwal Keskar on Monday dashed off a letter to the principal secretary of the state UD department, Ramanand Tiwari, objecting to the appointment of Patharkar, Benninger and Godbole.

In his letter, Keskar argued that Patharkar had recommended to the government to include 50 survey numbers in the August 8, 2000, de-zoning notification, without calling for suggestions and objections.

Similarly, Godbole owns a plot at survey number 77, which was shown as a hill-top and hill-slope in the draft DP. The said plot was changed to residential by the ruling party, while sanctioning the draft DP.

Benninger, too, has objected to the DP, challenging the â€œparking reservationâ€� at survey number 58 in Bavdhan, Keskar said.

â€œWe have no objection to Patwardhanâ€™s appointment, but, the remaining three â€œexpertsâ€� are interested parties, and hence their appointment should be cancelled,â€� Keskar has demanded, warning of moving the Bombay high court if the appointments were not cancelled.

Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena has postponed its proposed dharna at Mantralaya in Mumbai on March 25 to protest against the contentious changes in the DP.

In a statement, Sena city unit chief Rambhau Parikh said the dharna has been postponed as the government has assured to appoint a committee to probe into these contentious amendments. â€œIf the state government fails to appoint a committee by the first week of March, we will resume the agitation,â€� he said.

23,RSS line on Iraq upsets govt,"NEW DELHI: The Vajpayee government''s carefully calibrated policy on Iraq appears to have run up against some indirect opposition from the RSS. While critical of the US, RSS chief K Sudershan''s remarks at an internal discussion that he would prefer that India not be seen as supporting Iraq. This is because it would upset the RSS'' endorsement of the ""clash of civilisations"" theory, and weaken its Pakistan line.

A hint of this appears in an editorial in a forthcoming issue of the RSS mouthpiece, The Organiser. While it talks of the ""isolation"" of the US, refers to way it has supported rogue regimes, encouraged them, and then attempted to civilise them, it also makes the point that the argument that the US ""must seek the permission of Bonn and Beijing to use its military might against what it perceives as a threat to its security"" makes no sense.

Sudershan''s line has upset the government, official sources said. ""Iraq not necessarily Saddam Hussein has been a traditional friend, and in post-conflict Iraq, we will have a role. Moreover, the government must not be seen as anti-Iraq because it would have a negative impact on our Muslims, a majority of whom are Sunnis like the vast majority of the Iraqis.""

RSS sources said the inspiration for the editorial came from Sudershan''s remarks. When asked about India''s position on Iraq, he began by saying that the government''s position on it was partially correct. The government line that no country should be arbitratrily labelled terrorist, that the unilateral war was wrong even as there was an acknowledgement that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was correct, he said.

But then Sudershan stressed that the current problem had not been created by the US or Iraq alone, but by the UN which had failed to resolve so many problems, including Kashmir. How many years, Sudershan asked his interlocutors, was the US expected to wait till the UN backed it on Iraq? If the US felt Iraq was a threat to its security, why did it need permission from Beijing or Moscow to use force? he asked.

Drawing a parallel, Sudershan said if India feels the terrorist camps in PoK threaten the country''s integrity, should it seek permission from other countries to take retaliatory action? If it does, it would impair the country''s sovereignty. It was in India''s interest that while it should not give unconditional support to the US, it should not be seen to be embracing Saddam Hussein, the RSS chief said.
