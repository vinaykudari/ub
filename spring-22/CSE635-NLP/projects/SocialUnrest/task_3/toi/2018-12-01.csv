0,Women to rule 158 villages in Kutch,"rajkot: the earthquake-ravaged border district of kutch is poised for a dramatic change. with 2002 fast approaching, about 158 villages in 10 talukas of this far-flung and second largest district of the country would have women at the helm of affairs. this is perhaps the first time that the border district would have such a large number of women in command as the countdown for the village panchayat elections begins. the 'sarpanchs', or village headmen, in these 158 villages would be women. it is sheer coincidence that the kutch women would head the village panchayats during the women's empowerment year, that too in a big way. the present president of kutch district panchayat is a woman, jagrutiben shah, the daughter of former state finance minister babubhai meghji shah. the panchayat election process in 480 villages of kutch district has already begun as part of the statewide exercise to hold panchayat polls in 10,368 villages on december 23. the posts of 'sarpanchs' in 10 talukas of kutch have been reserved for women. in abdasa taluka 28 out of 81 villages will have women 'sarpanchs', while in gandhidham two out of seven villages will have women 'sarpanchs'. the number of villages where women would occupy the 'sarpanchs' post in other talukas of kutch are mandvi -- 19 out of 62; mundra -- 6 out of 19; anjar 11 out of 29; bhachau -- 16 out of 50; nakhatrana -- 25 out of 66; bhuj -- 27 out of 85 and lakhpat -- 9 out of 27. the phenomenon of a woman occupying the ruler's position at the village level is not new to this border district. several kutch villages have women 'sarpanchs', including jawaharnagar and dhaneti in bhuj. however, it is too early to say how many of these 158 villages, ready to elect the fairer sex to the top post in the village, will have 'samras' status. a clear picture will emerge only after december 3, the last date for filing nominations. all said and done, the border district of kutch is set to write a new chapter in history.

1,Jharkhand govt biased: Dubey,"patna: minister for registration and adult education and congress leader vijay shankar dubey on friday alleged that the jharkhand government has been biased in not providing adequate security to the two former chief ministers of bihar, laloo prasad yadav and jagannath mishra, lodged in the bacon factory guest house-turned-camp jail in ranchi under judicial remand. dubey said the jharkhand government did not adhere to the requisite protocol when the two former cms arrived in ranchi. they should not have been treated by the jharkhand government like convicts. mishra had been the cm of bihar for many years and so the jharkhand government should have cared for his health as well, he added. according to a press release issued on his behalf, dubey along with congress state president and medical education minister shakeel ahmad will visit ranchi to take stock of the measures taken to provide security and health facilities to the former cms.

3,Board for organic farming mooted,"new delhi: a task force on organic farming has recommended a national-level permanent board to oversee the promotion of organic farming in the country and coordinate with various union ministries, states, agencies, research institutes and universities. giving its report to union agriculture minister ajit singh on thursday, the task force led by kunwarji bhai jadav recommended that the government promote the concept as a sustainable and better alternative to create an enabling environment. it suggested tax incentives and support as well as creation of facilities and certification agencies, and wants governments to lead the way with demonstrations on government farms. singh has directed his ministry to take up a pilot project. organic farming, which involves growing crops without harmful fertilisers or insecticides, is expected to get a token amount of rs 100 crore during the tenth plan. indian council of agricultural research chief panjab singh, a member of the task force, said there could be no doubt that an organic source is the better one — from all aspects, resources, environment and health. but there could be practical difficulties, ranging from availability of compost to quality parameters requiring testing labs and checks. all this would have to be organised and put in place. even then, the whole country can't make the shift. the task force, he said, has suggested some areas could be designated organic farming zones; it has not specified these. listing its recommendations, the task force, which began its work in october last year, has said a shift to organic farming in high-production areas could lead to an initial loss of produce, possibly necessitating compensation to farmers for the first couple of years. it has suggested states be asked to consider experimentation and demonstrations on half the area of government farms. krishi vigyan kendras could do the same. as an incentive, it has suggested tax exemption for ventures in vermicompost, compost, press mud and other forms of organic nutrient generation for crops. that is not all. it has recommended government support be decided after equating the economic value of chemical fertilisers and organic manure, in terms of overall effect on soil productivity and crop production. the task force has suggested an adequate number of certification agencies should be identified and recognised, and perhaps even financed by the government to carry out free certification for farmers for export. obviously, there is a lot of nitty- gritty. developing markets for supply and purchase of inputs and output, for one.

4,Victims of domestic violence speak out,"new delhi: they come from different regions, backgrounds and classes. they are not all affluent or educated. but what binds them together is the fact they have all been victims of domestic violence. instead of suffering in silence, these women have chosen to take on their families and society and speak out about their suffering and the need to break the silence around domestic violence. the voices of nazia, sumitra, asha, priti, nirmala along with other victims of domestic violence have been vividly captured in the short, one-minute film spots, prepared by film-maker shabnam virmani for the international centre for research on women (icrw) as part of its ''bol'' campaign. the message is that women subjected to violence at home need not remain silent for fear of social ostracisation. in short, these women raise fundamental questions like, ''who has given men the right to beat up women'' or ''how can a husband be worshipped like a god when he raises a hand at his wife.'' emerging as inspirational role models, these women exhort other victims not to brush aside these incidents: ''why should we be ashamed, it is this society which should be ashamed, which wants to push such matters under the carpet.'' shifting focus, several spots also feature men who are shown reaching out to society as fathers and common citizens condemning domestic violence and stressing the need to challenge masculine stereotypes vis a vis the issue of violence. of course, for all the men who refuse to acknowledge that such incidents take place in cities and among the educated, there are others who admit that men who beat their wives do so out of a sense of insecurity: ''they give vent to their frustration by beating up somebody weaker.'' according to shabnam, they did a lot of preparatory work with the women before actually shooting the film. ''most of them were more than willing to talk about their experiences but we first explained the implication of going public, before actually putting them before a camera,'' she said. many women did cry off when they understood the consequences of speaking out. but those who did speak, did so fearlessly, unmindful of their family's reactions, shabnam added. according to nata duvary of icrw, their research in india has revealed how pervasive the problem of domestic violence is in the country. she says their data shows that about 50 per cent of women reported experiencing at least one form of domestic violence in their married life. the study shows that domestic violence is prevalent in all classes. despite this, she said, it remains largely unreported as it is invariably treated as a private matter. the icrw hopes to inspire and generate awareness about this problem through these film spots, which they hope to put both on doordarshan and cable television channels.

5,"Terror alone won’t work in elections, feels BJP","lucknow: the state bjp is in a fix as it looks for issues for the forthcoming assembly elections. on one hand they have terror and on the other development, something on which the congress has already taken the lead causing concern in the ruling party. there were speculations that terrorism could emerge as a major election issue. after a threadbare discussion, however, the senior leaders have felt that terrorism cannot be the sole issue in the state polls. a minister, who is also member of the election manifesto committee, said that bjp was keenly watching the election strategy of its arch rival samajwadi party. after the ban on simi, the sp leaders made a noise in favour of the outfit. but within two days, they stopped talking about simi. similar is the case with poto. this political strategy of mulayam singh yadav has prevented terrorism from becoming an election issue, he said. we will clear our stand on terrorism and poto, but i fear this cannot be a major election issue, he said. the state leadership too realises this, he added. members of the election manifesto committee held a day-long meeting at the party headquarters on friday. the old manifesto was taken out and a detailed list was prepared on the promises that had been kept. terrorism could be an issue, but the focus of the election manifesto would be on development, said lalji tandon, who attended the meeting. the bjp government has changed the face of almost all the important cities of the state. not only this, we have also worked for the uplift of the downtrodden.

6,No politics in Shotgun’s appointment: Rajnath,"lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh on friday insisted that people should not read politics into the appointment of shatrughan sinha as the chairman of the film development council saying it had been done solely with the aim of giving boost to film activities in the state. he said the appointment was done only after obtaining consent from the cine-star-turned-politician. it has nothing to do with the next assembly elections in the state, he pointed out. meanwhile, the first meeting of the council is scheduled to be held in the next month as suggested by sinha, state information secretary alok ranjan said. he made it clear that the council was not an 'inactive' body as reported in a section of the media and said it had been reorganised under the chairmanship of sinha. he said that in order to develop film activities in the state, a film policy was finalised in 1999 with 'udyog bandhu' as its nodal department. after some amendments, the information department was made the nodal agency and a separate 'film bandhu' was proposed to be set up. he said that a sum of rs five crore had already been sanctioned for various activities of film bandhu. for the time being the services of officers and employees of information department would be availed. he said a script committee set up earlier had been considering applications for loan received by picup. he said the state government would provide several concessions, facilities, man power and equipment to the film-makers, who were willing to shoot in up. the government had also announced to make those films which were shot in the state tax free.

7,US visa rules to be costly for infotech firms,"mumbai: silicon valley unemployment figures have begun to pinch indian it companies. as more and more pink slips are handed out to it workers in the us, the bush administration has taken steps to ensure that highly skilled but modestly paid overseas professionals do not rush in to provide an inexpensive alternative. the recently passed american competitiveness 21st century act, coupled with h1b visa rules, is striking at the heart of the indian advantage by removing the cost arbitrage between the wages of indian it professionals and their western couterparts. the new act is aimed at safeguarding the interests of local us workers who have been displaced by overseas professionals. the combined effect is that all employers have to pay the prevailing wage in that particular region to h1b workers, as provided in the wage survey. so, if the prevailing wage for a systems analyst in massachusetts is, say, $55,000 per annum, the employer who brings in a foreign worker on h1b has to pay the same amount. foreign workers have thus far tended to be hired at lower salaries. moreover, an employee on a us visa will now have to be paid a minimum salary of $60,000 per annum unless there is a letter from his or her employer in the us stating that the new employee has not replaced someone laid off in the same position 90 days prior to the layoff and 90 days after the layoff. it majors like infosys and wipro have already had to realign their salary structure to meet the new guidelines. the salaries of all the new h1b visa holders of indian it firms after september 1 have been hiked. analysts believe that the move will hit the bottomline of indian it professionals as salaries will have to be revised significantly. ''companies sending it professionals for on-site work will now be forced to keep up with the regulation. this will impact on their profitability,'' said an analyst. when contacted, a wipro spokesperson said, ''the new rule impacts only fresh visas, issued after september 1. for such people, we will need to have the minimum salary. the floor level is not applicable to all the h1b visa holders.'' an infosys spokesperson also admitted that that company was complying with all the regulations. industry analysts point out that not all clients are ready to issue such letters and selective salary increases in cases where no letter has been issued could lead to employee dissatisfaction. hence, the only way out was a salary increase for on-site employees, taking the minimum salary to $60,000 per annum. many indian it companies have so far leveraged the cost arbitrage opportunity. the move has ended the age of ''body-shopping'' it companies.
