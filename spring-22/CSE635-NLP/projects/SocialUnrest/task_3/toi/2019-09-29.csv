0,Chautala for simpler labour laws,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala on Saturday stressed the need for simplification of labour laws and enhancement in the quantum of penalty for their violation in the same manner as had been enhanced for amending the company laws.

The chief minister in his address to the 38th session of the two-day Indian labour conference that began in Delhi on Saturday said that amendment in labour laws had been necessitated because the provision of penalty for violation of labour laws was inadequate. There had been occasions when desired results had not been achieved despite strict implementation of labour laws. He pointed out that amendment of labour laws was also required because these were not providing favourable atmosphere to the industries and security to labour. Also it had become difficult to effectively implement these laws because these were not clear, misleading and complex.

While referring to the recommendations made by the study group constituted by the second labour commission the chief minister said that states should be given adequate time to study its report as the states had the responsibility for implementation of labour laws. The chief minister said the Haryana government was not only studying the report, but was also seeking the opinion of various labour organisations. The state government would send its comments on various points of the report to the Central government shortly, he said.

Chautala said labour laws should be simplified within a specific time for speedy industrialisation. He said that in various labour Acts, the same word had different meaning, which led to a situation of uncertainty and increasing litigation. Therefore while simplifying the labour laws, the meaning of words should be defined clearly.

1,Economy will be guided by politics: Jaswant,"NEW DELHI: Finance minister Jaswant Singh was candid enough to concede in a meeting with the CEOs of leading US companies on Saturday that electoral politics will determine the course of economic reforms in India.

Singh admitted that reforms had got into the political spin of the Indian democracy.

Addressing about 50 CEOs of companies which have invested in India at a meeting in Washington, Singh reiterated the governmentâ€™s commitment to the process of reforms but made it plain that only reforms which get popular electoral backing can be expected to go forward.

Singh said it was politics which was behind the postponement of decisions on privatisation of two state-owned oil companies and the differences within the government on raising of foreign equity limits in insurance, telecom and aviation.

â€˜â€˜The recent debate on disinvestment and FDI must be interpreted as a process to deal with the complexities and dynamics of democracy in the country,â€™â€™ he said.

3,City reels under rally blues,"LUCKNOW: It was a virtual ''sea of humanity'' and a ''deluge of blue'' at the Ambedkar Sthal on Saturday as lakhs of BSP workers converged on the jail road-situated site to express their solidarity behind party vice-president Mayawati''s call for a Dhikkar rally.

The crowd, which had started assembling in the city since Thursday night, peaked on Saturday morning. The supporters came from both far off and nearby districts on trains, trucks, tractors, cars, jeeps and even tongas. Leaving their vehicles at the parking slots situated at considerable distance from the venue of the rally, they trudged their way to the Ambedkar Sthal.

Holding aloft BSP flags they rendered full-throated slogans, some of which went like UP ki majboori hai Mayawati zaroori hai, Bachcha-Bachcha Bhim ka BSP ke team ka and Baba Ambedkar ke samman mein BSP utri maidan mein.

Predictably, the mood among the BSP supporters was not only upbeat but also festive. So also was the rally site. Vendors were seen doing brisk business, the favourites being chaat, laiya chana and fruits. Men and women of all age groups donning their festive best could be seen haggling or making purchases. Drinking water proved to be a problem as even ''much was not enough'' going by the huge turnout.

5,Huda rushes reminder to govt on layouts,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Urban Development Authority (Huda) has rushed a reminder to the government seeking clarification regarding Urban Land Ceiling (ULC) clearance in unauthorised layouts after it did not receive reply from the government since it first wrote to it on May 15.

In a press release, Huda stated that it had identified more than 1,100 unauthorised layouts that do not confirm to layout standards and have no prescribed standard of works and amenities in nine municipalities and gram panchayats.

Immediately after that, Huda issued a public notification in April, 2001 listing out the unauthorised layouts and announced a layout regularisation scheme requesting developers, owners, plot owners and associations to use it so that it can examine each case and take up the regularisation.

In all, Huda received 720 applications. However, of these, 434 pertained to single plot regularisations. After a thorough examination many deficiencies were found in them. As many as 570 cases had ULC clearance problems, where most of them were covered in the core area of ULC limits. Regarding the ownership of ULC clearance aspects, the GO Ms. No. 367 MA dated July 12, 1988 provisions are silent. In may layouts, Huda found the circulation and internal road pattern had less road width than required as per the regulations. Many layouts did not even have proper approach roads.

Huda also found that almost all layouts did not have the statutory minimum open space of 10 per cent of the total layout area. It said many layouts were contrary to the statutory master plan or zonal development plan provisions. In many layouts, there was no development, and they were plotted on green field sites.

7,Preference to SSIs in govt purchases demanded,"COIMBATORE: Southern India Engineering and Manufacturers'' Association (SIEMA) has appealed to the Tamil Nadu government to give preference to small scale sectors in all their purchases, as was done in many foreign countries, to uplift the sector.

In a paper on the status of engineering and manufacturing industry, particularly electric motors, monoblocks and pumps, Siema President, G Rajendran said the government should consider to provide various incentives to SSIs to make Tamil Nadu as number one state in the industrial map.

Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation, which was providing term loans at 15.25 per cent interest, should reduce it to below 10 per cent and follow the pattern of foreign financial institutions in re-financing the banks for lending term loans, Rajendran suggested.

Stating that tax rates for motors, pumps and switch gears were high in the state, Rajendran alleged that many unorganised sector manufacturers were selling their products without bill, resulting in loss of revenue to the government exchequer.

He pointed out that local switch gear industry was facing tough time with the prevailing rate of 15 per cent tax, as spurious manufacturers were selling similar products without tax from other states.

He appealed to bring down the CST from four per cent to one per cent so that the input cost of the production could be brought down, to have a competitive edge to local products.

While introducing the new scheme with special thrust to agro-based industries, with a capital investment of Rs one crore for new enterprises, Rajendran said the government had by ""oversight or inadvertently"" had withdrawn subsidies to engineering and automobile industries, which were groaning under recession and consequent industrial slow down.

These industries would like to take advantage of the turn around of economic growth, and restoration of these subsidies would go a long way in reviving the small and medium industries, he said, and requested to maintain status-quo to help the existing engineering industries.

He appealed to the government to take immediate action to classify more areas as industrial, so as to meet the urgent requirments, to ensure quick industrial growth and create jobs.

In order to improve the quality of power, supply frequency had to be improved, voltage to be increased and fluctuation to be limited to maximum of plus 10 per cent. Improved quality of power could result in eight to 10 per cent improvement in pump set efficiency, he said.

The house strongly condemns such allegations.â€�

Representatives of CITU, S.P. Lepcha and Nirmal Barailey, stood by Bhattacharya. â€œWe staged a walkout from the meeting. The labourers have also come to know the proâ€“management attitude of the HPWU and have started joining us,â€� Lepcha said.

9,"CIL, govt in talks for rehabilitation of people living along coal belts","KOLKATA: The Coal India top brass will initiate discussions with the West Bengal and Jharkhand governments for rehabilitation of the people living along the subsidence-prone coal belts of Raniganj and Jharia.CIL chairman NK Sharma said in Kolkata on Sunday that it was time for the governments to display political will in tackling the problem of heavy settlements in mine areas. Some of the settlements are over the mines of Eastern Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal that are nearly 100 years old. They are not only hazardous to human lives, they also affect mining activities, Sharma said.He felt conditions would have to be created through sustained pressure from various quarters to force the governments to act. Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi has realised that the situation at Jharia is critical and settlements need to be relocated. Otherwise, there would be economic, environment and law and order problems, he said.Sharma expressed his surprise at how BCCL was continuing with the loss-making mines in the present open market economy structure.On loss-making mines in ECL and excess staff on its payrolls, he said the issues were being discussed with the state government.

10,Nagappa family upset over govt 'apathy',"MYSORE: Even 37 days after Veerappan abducted Nagappa, the Special Task Force is still groping in the dark, with no clues to the former minister''s whereabouts or his well-being. No definite information has been provided to his family, and wife Parimala is upset.

Nagappa''s near and dear ones are slowly growing disillusioned with the government, which has a lethargic attitude towards the crisis. Speaking to The Times of India over telephone from Kamagere, Parimala said she is upset with the government''s handling of the issue. ""I can say I am satisfied only when my husband rejoins me and all of us safely, till then no amount of cajoling or assurances will satisfy me,"" she said.

""Though the government seems to have withdrawn operations, it is yet to clear the forests of the STF,"" she said, adding that it had taken almost a month for the government to decide whether to continue or discontinue operations.

Negotiations have also been deadlocked, with the government yet to name an emissary to venture into the forests. Despite requests from us and our party leaders, it is intriguing that there have been no efforts to negotiate, says Parimala.

""We are still demanding that the government send Kolathur Mani, as requested by Veerappan,"" she said. ""If not Mani, the government has to finalise somebody. We are helpless on the emissary issue, we want Mani to go,"" she pleaded.

Parimala will be meeting her family''s well-wishers from the taluk after September 30. They will take stock of the situation and even plan the future course of action on ending the hostage drama, she disclosed.

""Neither CM Krishna nor Home Minister Kharge have spoken to me in the recent past to apprise me of the progress made by the government on the issue,"" she said.

Parimala has no plans to meet Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee or any other central minister. However, she was appreciative of the Lingayat seers and Janata Parivar leaders who have kept the pressure on the government to end the abduction saga.
