0,BJP mounts offensive on tainted ministers,"NEW DELHI: The BJP, finally in opposition mode, raised the issue on Tuesday of the ruling Congress-led coalition inducting chargesheeted persons in the Union government to embarrass the Manmohan Singh government. Is Prime Minister Manmohan Singh''s ""standard of probity the same"" as it is for Bihar CM Rabri Devi? BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley asked.

Referring to the inclusion of Laloo Prasad Yadav and his party colleagues Mohammed Taslimuddin, Jai Prakash Yadav and M A Fatmi in the Union council of ministers and releasing documents on these charges, he said, ""These are persons against whom chargesheets have been initiated and they are included in the ministry. The PM is an honourable man and this practice of including in his ministry persons having a criminal background is not in keeping with his stature.""

Anticipating question on the fact that there has been more than one BJP minister in the NDA government facing charges in the demolition of the Babri Masjid, he said Ayodhya was a ""national struggle"" and cannot be compared with these cases.

1,Sulking AP ministers fall in line,"HYDERABAD: Things began to fall in line in the new Congress government with one of the three sulking ministers deciding to assume office on Wednesday.

Labour and employment minister G Vinod, who had given his resignation letter to his father and Peddapalli MP-elect G Venkataswamy on the ground that the latter was not accommodated in the Union Cabinet, met CM Rajasekhara Reddy here on Tuesday and decided to take up his ministerial responsibilities.

This happened after Venkataswamy along with Vinod said in New Delhi on Monday that he was, indeed, hurt over his non-inclusion in the Union cabinet but felt that his son ""who is an upcoming politician with bright future should not lose the chance that came his way and should take up the ministership."" After his brief meeting with Reddy, Vinod said he had decided to assume office on the advise of his father. ""We met (AICC leader) Ambika Soni and she told us what all had happened. We are satisfied with AICC''s response to my father''s hurt feeling,"" he said.

PCC chief D Srinivas, who is still camping in Delhi, appears to have reconciled to the rural development ministry he had been given, though his main grouse was reportedly that the plum panchayat raj department was deliberately taken away from him.

2,Cong will revamp party set-up now,"NEW DELHI: After the daunting exercise of government formation, the task of revamping the party set-up to streamline the organisation is next on the cards for the Congress party president Sonia Gandhi.

With senior party functionaries opting for ministerial berths, vacancies have been created in the AICC set-up. However, the party wants to carry out the exercise beyond the usual procedure of replacing some outgoing general secretaries with new faces. Significantly, not a single young Congress MP has made it to the three-tier ministry, who are likely to get a call to join the organisation instead.

""Since the party elders had to be given space in the ministry because of their seniority, the young brigade will be asked to prove their mettle in the organisation,"" remarked a source close to Sonia Gandhi.

The party shake-up will probably take place after Sonia Gandhi is chosen as the chairperson of the UPA coordination committee. Recalling her concern for the party organisation, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma on Monday confirmed that the revamp was on the cards.

""The Congress organisation should lend strength to the government and focus on the party structure,"" Sharma said. He said that the party would ensure implementation of its manifesto by the government. Questioned about the procedure, he disagreed that this would mean the party acting as a watchdog overseeing the government performance.

Asked about the inclusion of chargesheeted ministers like Laloo Prasad Yadav, Taslimuddin, Shibu Soren, Jaiprakash Yadav and MAA Fatmi in Manmohan Singh''s council of ministers, the Congress spokesman denied his party had anything to do with their selection. ""In a coalition government, the partners decide as they have been given a mandate by the people,"" he remarked declining to say anything more on the issue.

3,Foreign policy could become CMP problem,"NEW DELHI: Foreign policy could become a bone of contention between the Left and Congress, so also reservation in the privatised public sector companies. Left is opposed to Congress seeking a special ""strategic"" relation with the US and wants to discontinue the strategic alliance with Israel.

Federalism, foreign policy and economic issues are three areas on which CPM politburo (PB) could take a stand different from that of the draft CMP prepared by Congress. The PB meeting on Tuesday in Kolkata will also decide whether CPM should accept the Speaker''s post.

CPI''s response on Monday to the draft CMP had a difference of opinion on foreign policy. CPI''s suggestion is, ""in the section on foreign policy about strategic and economic engagement with USA, rewrite as follows: ''Closer friendship and economic engagement with all countries including USA and G-7 countries''.""

CPI also wants Indian mercenaries to be withdrawn from Iraq and a ban on further recruitment of ex-army officers and personnel, correction of distortions in the Middle-East policy and discontinuation of the strategic alliance with Israel.

6,FM's top priority: Correct government's fiscal health,"NEW DELHI: FM P Chidambaram on Tuesday got cracking in three crucial areas of economic management: growth, inflation and consolidation of government finances. There were indications that the first phase of fiscal correction â€” raising higher resources and cutting wasteful expenditure â€” will be taken up in this year''s budget.

On just the second day in office, Chidambaram had a series of meetings with top bureaucrats, RBI governor Y V Reddy, Sebi chairman G N Bajpai, UTI chief M Damodaran and leading industrialists Kumarmangalam Birla and Anil Ambani.

Correcting shape of the treasury was the first task to get his attention. A team headed by advisor to finance minister Vijay Kelkar and including chief economic advisor Ashok Lahiri has been busy preparing a road map on getting the government''s terrible finances in order.

Chidambaram said honouring the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act requires the government to reach zero revenue deficit by 2009. This has to be achieved by cutting wasteful expenditure and mobilising resources. The Kelkar team is understood to have thrown up a few ideas as to how that can be done in phases beginning with this budget.

Sustaining high economic growth and keeping prices under check were in focus in Chidambaram''s hour-long meeting with the RBI governor. ""I have assured the finance minister that in our assessment the outlook for prices (5%) remain as indicated in the monetary policy,"" Reddy said afterwards.

IDBI and UTI chief also called on Chidambaram and apprised him about the latest developments in the financial sector.

Chidambaram had a detailed meeting with former Indian ambassador to the US, Naresh Chandra, who also heads the committee that is looking into the Dhabhol power project. Chandra said the Dabhol issue did figure during the discussions with the FM which was ""general"" in nature.

Anil Ambani of Reliance and the head of Aditya Birla group called on the minister and both described the meeting as ""courtesy call"". Planning commission member and chairman of the committee on foreign direct investment policy, N K Singh, who was revenue secretary when Chidambaram was finance minister in UF government of 1996-98, also had a short meeting with Chidambaram.

Earlier during the day, Chidambaram met PM Manmohan Singh in connection with finding the solution that was reached regarding the portfolio row involving DMK ministers. On getting S S Palanimanickam as his deputy in the finance ministry, he said he would have no problem working with the DMK member who had earlier been given commerce and industry portfolio.

7,Congress will win bye-elections: Amarinder,"LUDHIANA: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday claimed the Congress party would win three bye-elections in the state in spite of the defeat in recent parliamentary elections.

Addressing a meeting of party workers here, the CM vowed to turn the tables on Akalis on strength of the party cadres, who felt rejuvenated after the formation of a Congress-led coalition government at the Centre. The impending bye-elections would be contested after introspection into causes of the defeat of party candidates in LS polls, he said.

Amarinder Singh acknowledged the necessity of having a sound party base and assured that due respect would be accorded to workers. The defeated Congress candidate from Ludhiana, Manish Tiwari, strongly urged the CM to issue directions to government officials not to harass workers whenever they approach them for work.

The CM listed achievements of his government and said many things could not be done due to the biased approach of the previous government. The pace of development would pick up now as the party has its own government at Centre, Amarinder said. He said he would take up the issue of reviving industry in the state with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh soon.

State Congress president H S Hanspal also addressed the meeting.

8,It's Laloo's govts. Will crime on wheels stop?,"DANAPUR: With Laloo Prasad Yadav taking over as railway minister in the new Congress-led Union government, railway security personnel are confident that criminal activities, particularly dacoities, in trains will now be curbed to some extent in the state.

The Danapur division of East Central Railway (ECR) has alone registered about 15 cases of dacoity so far this year as against about 40 cases of dacoity, looting and snatching recorded last year.

Security officials of ECR said the Bihar government, which is directly responsible for maintaining law and order in and around railway station areas, would no more give any leeway to criminals to carry out their activities in trains. Being de facto chief minister of Bihar, Laloo would certainly not tolerate criminals creating havoc in trains, they observed, adding that the new railway minister would ask the DMs and SPs of concerned districts to deal sternly with the criminals involved in train dacoities.

According to sources, criminals, after committing crimes in running trains, take shelter at places which are under the jurisdiction of state police. RPF cannot take any legal action against such criminals. Thus, state police have to co-operate fully with railways in order to bring them to book. Unfortunately, most of the cases against hardcore criminals were earlier closed by railway police on the plea of ""no clue found"", the sources said, adding that railways now expect ""result"" in such cases as Laloo, in fact, heads both railways and state police.

On condition of anonymity, a senior ECR official told Times News Network that about 48 per cent punctuality rate of trains, mainly mail and express ones, was lost in the state recently due to the poor law and order situation.

Banned Naxalite outfits do not allow normal train movement in the Dhanbad and Danapur divisions of ECR, particularly on the Patna-Gaya and Kiul-Gaya sections.

Laloo would have to rise to the occasion to ensure a safe railway journey for the common people in the state, he maintained.

Laloo will also have to deal firmly with his own party workers in the state, who are said to have caused loss of railway property worth more than Rs 10 crore in the past in the wake of agitations, bandhs, rallies and dharnas in the state.

Only time will tell how successful Laloo proves to be as railway minister.

9,18 medical colleges took government favours,"PUNE: As many as 18 medical as well as dental colleges in the state have been found to take land, either free of cost or at concessional rates from the Maharashtra government, for setting up their colleges.

Even as the state governor-appointed committee''s report on determining the status of the aided/partially aided medical and dental colleges is still awaited, another study report published by the Institute of Costs and Works Accountants of India (ICWAI) has revealed that a large number of these private educational institutions have taken favours of different kinds from the government, but still claim to be unaided!

The ICWAI (western region), after being appointed by the government in October last year to study the costs of and government aids to private medial and dental colleges, covered 17 private medical colleges and 18 dental colleges across the state.

The findings of the report are important in fixing the fee structure for the aided/partially aided medical/dental colleges in the state. Although most private colleges have at some point of time taken favours from the government, either in the form of land or other support, but are reluctant in implementing the government fee structure.

Interestingly, the Pune-based Dr DY Patil Pratisthan''s dental and medical colleges, and the Bharati Vidyapeeth deemed university''s medical college refused to share any information to the committee members.

The committee which has already submitted its report to the government, in its report said that the Prawara medical trust''s dental and medical colleges at Loni; Vidya Shikshan Prasarak Mandal''s dental college at Nagpur; and the Annasaheb Chudaman Patil dental and medical colleges at Dhule have received land free of cost.

Not only that, the Prawara medical trust''s dental and medical colleges at Loni; and the Annasaheb Chudaman Patil dental and medical colleges at Dhule also sought concession in the land cess/ property tax, which was granted by the state government.

Among those who got land at concession rates are the Yerala medical trust''s dental college, Navi Mumbai; Vasantdada Patil dental college at Sangli; Dr DY Patil dental and medical colleges at Nerul; Dr DY Patil medical college at Kohlapur; Terna dental college, Nerul; and MGM medical college at Navi Mumbai.

The Terna medical college at Navi Mumbai, along with the Vidarbha Youth Welfare Society''s dental college and hospital at Amravati; NKP Salve Medical College at Nagpur; Dr Punjabrao Deshmukh medical college at Amravati; and the Nashik Zilla Maratha Vidya Prasarak Mandal''s medical college got land at concessional lease/rent, the report stated.

The committee''s study report pointed out that while free land resulted in huge reduction in capital investment (life-long) and finance cost (interest) for the colleges, colleges which got land at concessional rates/lease or rent also got similar benefits. On the other hand, concession in land cess/property tax resulted in reduction in the operating cost of the colleges.

The committee also noted that several other colleges took concessions from organisations like Cidco, or use the government medical set-ups either free of cost or at concessional rates. The cost incurred by the government on such hospitals also need to be treated as aid provided, since the same results in reduction in the operating cost of the medical/dental colleges, the report highlighted.

12,Washington winces at New-insky,"WASHINGTON: Just when you thought Monica Lewinsky had been consigned to history, here comes a New-insky.Washington''s salons are aflame this week, not with talk of war, but that familiar hi-power fuel: Sex. At the heart of the scandal is a 23/24/26-year old intern-on-the-Hill Jessica Cutler, whose Internet diaries have some Washington pols running for cover, with the paparazzi behind them, trying to uncover.Writing under the nom de plume ""Washingtonienne,"" Ms Cutler, an entry-level aide to Republican Senator Mike Dewine, relates some arresting details about her sex life on Capitol Hill, including encounters for money with mid-level movers and shakers in the so-far staid Bush administration.Although her weblog has been removed from the Internet and she has been fired from her job, excerpts from her diaries are being reproduced on other sites. Identifying the characters involved has become Washington favourite parlour game. ""I am done with W, for real this time,"" reads one Cutler entry. ""A man who tries to f you in the a when you are sober does not love you. He should at least take you out for a few drinks to spare you the pain. Now I know that W does not care about me, only my a.""Another entry recounts, ""I just took a long lunch with F, and made a quick 400 dollars...When I returned to the office, I heard that the boss was asking about my whereabouts. Loser.""Professional bloggers, adept at feretting out information from the Internet, have been zeroing in on the possible names.""F is the easier of the two to find. All we have to do is find a `Chief of Staff'' appointed by President Bush whose first name begins with F, and we have found him. There is only one such person listed at results.gov. That person is...,"" chortled one blogger.By mid-week, the Cutler story had taken on the usual contours. It had surfaced in the mainline media, including in the Washington Post, New York Post and Fox TV. Book agents were hunting her down to pen her sordid story, Playboy magazine was getting the arclights ready, and a movie project was most certainly in the works.It was just another salacious season in Washington at war.In other entries and interviews, Ms Cutler revealed some of the mores of the age. ""Most of my living expenses are thankfully subsidised by a few generous older gentlemen,"" she wrote in one entry. ""I''m sure I''m not the only one who makes money on the side this way: how can anybody live on 25K ($25,000) a year?""In a moment of introspection, Ms Cutler is horrified at her lifestyle. ""Shit. I''m fucking six guys,"" she records. ""Ewww.""",WASHINGTON
