2,No new case of polio since Jan 2001,"mumbai: there is a piece of good news for mumbai __ not a single case of polio has been detected in the city since january this year. this news is also an indicator of the success of the pulse polio campaigns, being conducted by the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) every year since 1995. civic health officials are, however, far from complacent. executive health officer alka karande says, ``till saturday, we had not heard of any reported case of polio. if no case is reported by december, it would be the first such polio-free year.'' international guidelines state that an area can be declared polio-free if no cases are reported for three consecutive years. ``however, in a porous city such as mumbai, we have to be extra careful because there is always a chance of infection coming in with migrants from other states,'' noted dr karande. in 1994, before the onset of the nationwide pulse polio immunisation, there were 130 reported cases of polio in the city. the figure was down to two last year. last year, eight cases were detected all over maharashtra. meanwhile, the first phase of the 2001-2002 pulse polio campaign, which was held on sunday, met with a 95.96 per cent success rate. the target was immunising 11.2 lakh children below the age of five. it is up to this age that children have the risk of getting the infection. ``those children who missed the immunisation on sunday will be covered by the three-day intensive pulse polio immunisation (ippi), which started on monday,'' dr karande said. incidentally, the next two phases of the pulse polio drive will be held on december 9, 2001, and january 20, 2002. with the inception of the pulse polio drive in 1995, it was expected that at least mumbai would be free by 2001. but, there seems to be quite some way to go. ``projected targets are always higher than the real achievements,'' said dr karande. the oral polio vaccine has been available in the country since 1974, but till 1986, only half the children under five were covered by it. since the polio virus is eliminated through the faeces, the aim of the pulse drive is to immunise all children on the same day so that the disease-causing virus in the environment can be replaced with inert vaccine virus. experts point out that diseases such as polio and small pox, which affect only humans and do not have animal reservoir, can be eradicated through intensive vaccination drives. polio, which is caused by a virus, attacks the nervous system. depending on the point at which the nervous system has been infected, the patient suffers paralysis of limbs and, sometimes, the respiratory muscles. the early symptoms are fever and vomiting. paralysis sets in after six weeks.
