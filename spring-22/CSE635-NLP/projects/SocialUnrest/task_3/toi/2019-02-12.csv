2,"Infocity ready, now ball in govt's court, says builder","ahmedabad: in november 2000, when florida-based construction magnate dilip barot set out to build an ''infocity'' in gandhinagar, he appeared very gung-ho about the rs 200-crore project which was expected to catapult gujarat into the big it league. then, of course, the earthquake happened and apart from causing a personal loss to barot (his brother hitendra lost his wife in the mansi collapse), there was a big question mark raised on the viability of the project itself. one year after the earthquake, barot says he has reasons to be pleased with what he has accomplished, given the odds. the civil construction of the first block of infocity is complete and he has already fixed up 40 per cent of the tenants. vital issues like connectivity have been sorted out and other infrastructural work - building residential premises, a club and other entertainment facilities - is progressing as per schedule. but it is the ""government''s part of the contracted agreement"" that he is not happy with. barot said it was understandable that after the earthquake, all the government''s attention and resources got diverted towards relief and rehabilitation. but, now was the time for the government to pick up the threads and start marketing itself as a tech destination. ""events like resurgent gujarat were good, but would not achieve much unless they are projected abroad,"" he says. ""my job is to build the infocity, but it is for the government to make the project a success,"" he says. he says the problem with the government is that ""it has some excellent individuals, but the whole thing comes apart when they work as a team. there is a need for cohesion for collective focus towards a common goal, which is absent at the moment."" barot, who is leaving for the us on tuesday, said he is making fresh efforts to market the project in the us, europe and the far-east through his companies - creative infocity ltd and gujarat informatics ltd. barot admitted that several foreign companies, which had shown interest in infocity, backed out after the earthquake. he said the perception that after the quake gujarat would not have funds to market the project, the slump after the september 11 attacks on the us last year and the growing tension on the indo-pak border have had an adverse impact. ""but, we have not given up. we still feel that infocity is offering the best value for money to any investing company,"" he says. infocity had to scale down the per square feet cost from rs 2,000 to rs 1,500 after the earthquake, in comparison to a price of rs 3,000 upwards in places like mumbai, bangalore and hyderabad. besides this, after having invested rs 40 crore in the first phase, barot does not plan to add any more blocks. ""we will build these blocks as per the market demand and we do not want to go against the flow of the market,"" he said. he says he was not looking to develop infocity as a centre for software development, but as a telecom hub and a centre for it-enabled services and outsourcing. he said these are the areas where high degree of it skills are not required. in fact, entrepreneurship could come into play in these areas. among the clients that have already booked space are vsnl, bsnl, celforce, wipro, bharti telesonic and tele services. creative infocity is also negotiating with three long-distance telephone companies, including fusion. besides this, creative is also in talks with several gujarat-based it companies, which are comparatively small, but has a lot of promise. ""we have already tied up with applitech and three other companies and we will help them in getting business in the us and europe. there are a host of small and mid-sized companies abroad which are looking for partners to outsource their jobs,"" barot said. in fact, creative infocity is entering into joint ventures with most of these companies to help them expand their businesses.

3,"CM rubbishes opinion polls, says SAD will win","lambi:wild speculation is the order of the day and analyses a nightmare. opinion polls forecasting a clear win for the congress-cpi alliance in punjab was the talking point at the rally of punjab chief minister parkash singh badal on his home turf lambi,on monday. these polls often are manipulative tactics to influence voters and we will prove them wrong once the results are declared on february 24, said parkash singh badal while addressing an election rally here. rejecting the predictions that project a sweep for congress, badal said â€˜â€˜after gauging the mind and mood of the voters in the 117 assembly constituencies which i visited during the last fortnight, i am confident that sad(b)-bjp alliance would emerge triumphant in the state with a tally better than that in the last elections.â€™â€™ badal clearly looked perturbed when questioned by the times of india. â€˜â€˜i donâ€™t believe in quick-fix opinion polls that many indulge in these days but the victory tally of the alliance on february 24 would prove all exit polls unfounded and baseless,â€™â€™ he said. sukhbir singh badal, the general secretary of sad(b) said these were manipulative but useless tactics to change the mind of voters in punjab who had already made up their mind in favour of badal. their rivals, like gurnam singh abulkhurana, congress candidate from lambi, find badalâ€™s remarks ridiculous. â€˜â€˜in august, when a weekly magazine conduct an opinion poll, the punjab government spent crores of rupees to advertise that badal is the best chief minister punjab has ever had, now when the same group predicts that congress would outstrip the sad-bjp alliance, the suggestions are unpalatable for akalis,â€™â€™ he observed.

4,Babbu Mann props up Badal’s rally,"lambi, muktsar: punjab chief minister parkash singh badal can find comfort in the fact that he is still the clear leader for the people of lambi, despite a massive swing against the akalis in the state. but on monday, to put an impressive show of strength in his home constituency, where he is seeking re-election, the president of sad(b) had to engage punjabi singer babbu mann to draw the crowds. apart from babbu mann, who regaled the youngsters for over two hours, badal had to press madan lal khurana and bhairo singh shekhawat, former delhi and rajasthan chief ministers, to seek votes for him.and not leaving anything to chance, the chief minister worked extra hard to ensure a massive gathering. people from the adjoining states of haryana and rajasthan were ferried in buses and trucks to the site of the rally. sita ram, inld mla from dabwali (haryana) attended the rally with hundreds of supporters. similarly, surjeet singh, son of najar singh masita, former president of haryana unit of sad(b) came with about 200 men from masita village.a number of other people from chautala and odan villages in haryana participated in the rally to oblige om prakash chautala and enjoy the performance of babbu mann. about 50 buses and a number of trucks were pressed into service to take people to the rally site. while none of the speakers spared an opportunity to count the misdeeds of congress, madan lal khurana took the lead by reminding the listeners of the anti-sikh riots and reading out blasphemous remarks about guru teg bahadur in ncert books, prepared under the congress government in 1992. he produced the ncert book on mediaeval history of india and read out a chapter, â€˜â€˜jatt lootere hote hain. in cahoots with a muslim, guru tegh bahadur plundered punjab. that is the character of congress, which has ever tried to pollute the minds of children towards sikhs.â€™â€™ at the rally, all speakers continued to heap praise on atal behari vajpayee for favouring punjab. they also warned the people of loss of the centreâ€™s patronage if congress came to power in the state. vijay goyal reached the rally with a message from the prime minister, urging people to vote for badal ji, his chhota bhara (younger brother).

6,Amarinder fears poll violence,"chandigarh:punjab pradesh congress chief amarinder singh voiced fears that the ruling shiromani akali dal could resort to violence before or during polling out of sheer desperation, but asserted that the congress workers were ready to give a befitting reply. during the last lok sabha elections, the congressmen were ready with their â€œdandaâ€� to repulse any such attempt which proved to be a deterrent, c l a i m e d a m a r i n d e r singh. but he ruled out any largescale violence, saying that the administration would tackle the law and order situation as it was evident that the sad-bjp government was on its way out. however, he did not rule out sporadic incidents of violence in patti or lambi, from where adesh pratap kairon and chief minister parkash singh badalwere seeking re-election. he urged the media to keep a watch on such sensitive constituencies including his own, patiala. â€œthere wonâ€™t be any provocation from the congress side, which is any way winning the elections hands down,â€� he assured, saying the party would get at least twothirds majority. referring to the akali dal charges that he owed rs 22 crore to a bank, he explained that the issue of â€œdisputed paymentâ€� was sub-judice as the case was before the himachal high court, and was in vicinity of rs 2 crore. he said his attorney would file a criminal complaint of defamation against the akalis for releasing an advertisement based on baseless allegations. however, he maintained that the congress allegations against badal were based on facts. stating that the congress campaign and coverage by the media had been â€œtotally objectiveâ€�, amarinder discounted that the campaign was negative. he said the party had focussed on corruption, unemployment and non-performance of the government. â€œwhile we focussed on corruption and disproportionate assets, the akalis harped on 1984,â€� he asserted, claiming that the congress had set the election agenda and the akalis were on the defensive from day one. â€œsince the akalis had nothing to boast about, their entire campaign didnâ€™t mention any achievement in the last five years,â€� he added.

7,"Speed up grains’ procurement, govt told","patna: a division bench of the patna high court comprising chief justice ravi s dhavan and justice shashank k singh has asked the bihar government to expedite procurement of food grains in the state and directed the food corporation of india (fci) to cooperate in the effort. hearing a pil on low procurement of food grains by the fci in buxar district, the bench on monday asked the state food secretary to explain his departmentâ€™s â€œdismal performanceâ€�. the petitionerâ€™s counsel mrigank mauli said farmers are forced to make distress sale of paddy in order to meet their needs as the procurement by the fci is at a very low level with only 40 such centres in operation in bihar. while preparation for procurement of kharif output has started in punjab and haryana, the procurement of even paddy in bihar is yet to begin in right earnest. justice dhavan observed that the number of procurement centres in bihar is indeed very small. he said all agencies need to coordinate their efforts to provide succour to the suffering farmers. he wondered why the fci is not procuring rice instead of paddy. senior union government counsel p k shahi blamed the bihar government for the low procurement, submitting that it is not the job of the fci. he said in other states, the state government concerned directly buys and hands over the food grains to the fci. but the bihar government has introduced intermediaries â€” primary agriculture cooperative societies â€” which has added to the problem. it was decided at a meeting of the secretary of the union food and public distribution ministry with his bihar counterpart that the state government would facilitate procurement through the primary cooperatives and that the fci would buy only rice, he added. shahi said the fciâ€™s godowns in the state are overflowing as the bihar government has not lifted six lakh tonnes of rice meant for supply to the people living below the poverty line and even to those above it. the state government has not lifted its quota of wheat as well. the procurement through primary cooperatives is also adding to the woes of the farmers.

9,Co-op. to taste fruits of forced investment,"pune: nearly 11 years after being ''forced'' to invest rs 1.32 lakh in the national savings certificate (nsc) scheme, and five years after being ''officially'' denied the fruits of that investment, the lonavala industrial co-operative estate ltd recently received justice from the district consumer disputes redressal forum. in its complaint, the co-operative has claimed that the tehsilsar of maval had ordered it to invest rs 1.32 lakh in the eighth nsc issue in 1991. the certificates issued by the lonavla post office, on maturity on june 5, 1997, were to be worth rs 2.65 lakh. however, when the co-operative submitted the certificates for encashment in 1997, its claim was rejected on the ground that cooperatives by rule were prohibited from investing money in nscs. when the co-operative took the matter to higher authorities, it was asked to collect just rs 1.32 lakh, the amount originally invested.the postal authorities offered to pay nine per cent interest on the amount, which the co-operative rejected. deposing on behalf of the society before the consumer forum, advocate n.k. gokhale pointed out that although nsc rules prohibited co-operative societies from investing the money, the maharashtra co-operative societies act 1960 and indian trusts act 1882 permitted them to do so. moreover, an agreement between the co-operative and the postal department could not be termed void and the co-operative denied the maturity amount. while delivering the verdict, consumer court president r.y. patil and members s.s. pendse and m.m. sukhatme observed that the postal department had waited for six years of the maturity of the certificate to inform the co-operative of the violation of the nsc rule. in issuing the certificates, the postal authorities too failed to abide by the rules. the court accordingly directed the postal department to pay the remaining rs 1.33 lakh to the cooperative within the next three months. the department has also been directed to pay interest at the rate of nine per cent from august 14, 1998, till realisation of the amount.

10,GM adopts pressure tactics for investment,"mumbai/new delhi: general motors india is on a bargaining spree. the firm has received proposals from six states seeking to be the site for its second manufacturing unit. gm india is using these offers to seek better sops from the gujarat government. its only manufacturing unit is based in halol, vadodara district in the state.

gm''s indian subsidiary intends to start negotiations with the gujarat government immediately after its proposal for rs 600 crore additional equity infusion is cleared by the foreign investment promotion board (fipb). ""we will first approach authorities in gujarat and seek new facilities for this investment. in case, it is not forthcoming, we can go to the other states and set up a second manufacturing base there,"" gm india spokesman p balendran told the times of india.

""we are keeping our options open and will leverage the best deal. if the sops are given, we will use this fund to modernise the plant in gujarat,"" balendran added.

though the site for the second plant has not yet been finalised, balendran said, ""it would suit us to have a site either in north india or in south india in view of the big ancillary bases there."" the new unit would generate employment for locals and generate revenue worth $1 million for ancillary units.

interestingly, individual hard-sell campaigns by the respective governments have come at a time when senior officials at gmi have expressed unhappiness over the lack of response from the gujarat government to their pleas for better infrastructure and industrial incentives.

the gujarat plant''s locational disadvantage - long distance from mumbai port and also from the biggest car market delhi - has been adding to operational costs. another factor is the crippling cost of electricity in gujarat, which has the highest rate in the country.

favourable labour policies by other states, like maharashtra, are the other temptations for gmi. however, the idea of a second unit also has a possible link with gm corp''s fresh deal with daewoo motors india. gm had last week evinced interest in picking up the ailing subsidiary of daewoo motor corp, south korea, under a fresh takeover package. if the deal comes through, gm india may pump in the investment in daewoo''s up plant to enjoy locational advantages and tax breaks from the state government.

according to gmi sources, the fresh capital of rs 600 crore could also be used to set up two plants, based on the honda model. the investment would be used to fund its foray into multi-utility and sports-utility vehicles. the firm has already shortlisted isuzu panther and chevrolet blazer as the models to lead its utility vehicle attack here.

the decision to have two plants would help gmi leverage the best from the state governments and help broadbase its presence in india. the halol plant, which employs 500 regular employees and 250-odd contractual staff, has the capacity to produce 25,000 units per annum on a two-shift basis.

11,IT revolutionalises election process,"mumbai: replacing typewriter ribbons, whiting ink and sore fingers, information technology has revolutionised the election to the municipal corporation. the four staff assigned to prepare and update the list of candidates and record the number of votes polled say they are discovering the joys of the enter, delete and backspace keys. computers have lightened the burden of once-despised chore that took hours of work on a typewriter. among the perks: getting to work in an air-conditioned room. for the 2,063 candidates who slugged it out at the hustings, computer intelligence has made a world of difference. no longer will an illegible squiggle botch up wafer-thin margins as accuracy and efficiency become the rule. ""the speed and accuracy of it is catalysing information-processing in this election,"" says additional municipal commissioner, gautam chatterjee, who is in charge of the elections. there was another benefit. though no official figures are yet available about the savings on account of computerisation, officials estimate it to be almost rs 1 crore. for the first time in maharashtra, the election results are available online, at www.mcgm.gov.in/elections/htm. in addition, two mega-screens outside the civic headquarters display the latest results. ""there is no need to scream out results on megaphones after each round,"" said an official. ""candidates and even residents can get the results at home or from a cyber cafe."" the brihanmumbai municipal corporation''s high-tech poll revolution started when a group of enterprising employees who had demonstrated facility with computers was handpicked from different civic departments. in fact, among the four computer operators, one is from the conservancy department in the western suburbs, says an official. in previous elections, the corporation would sometimes have to outsource secretarial and clerical services at election time. it meant typing out not only the names, addresses and symbols of the candidate, but also trends and the margin by which the candidates lost or won the elections. ""many times, the margins by which a candidate had won the election would not tally when the difference between the votes of two candidates were taken. or sometimes, a single error would end up rendering the entire sheet incorrect,"" a civic official said. ""to rectify the errors, the entire process would have to be started all over again__the operator would have no option but to type out all the data on a fresh sheet of paper."" now, he said, the operator only has to change the particular entry. the bmc made another imporant technology leap when it used a power point presentation to 600 polling superintendents to demonstrate how to conduct the polls. power point is a computer programme for creating audio-visual presentations similar to slide shows, but takes much less time and trouble to create. ""earlier, we used to have drab lectures with demonstrators physically showing how to fold the ballot paper, how to direct a voter, bringing in the ballot or sealing it. here, all 600 superintendents saw demos on screen and this really clicked,"" said mr chatterjee. ""i was surprised to see their interest in the presentation, especially during the question and answers session."" still, mr chatterjee said that there is a scope for improvement. ""ideally, i would have liked all 60,000 election personnel to be trained in this programme conducted through power point. we will try that next time."" then, there are the joys of e-mail. nearly 500 election-related circulars, which earlier had to be despatched through peons, were sent through e-mail to 24 ward officers. every ward office is connected to bmc''s main server. ""we would have incurred heavy costs on manpower and vehicles if we had used the conventional despatch method of the bmc,"" mr chaterjee said. still, for a municipal corporation with a rs 5,000-crore budget, savings is not uppermost in mr chatterjee''s mind. ""i am more satisfied that this year''s civic election was carried out with speed and accuracy,"" he said. ""saving was just a by-product of this entire process.""

12,Scholars shut out election din,"deobandh: the shrill cacophony of the election campaign in the town does not penetrate the high walls of dar-ul uloom, a reputed seat of learning, where students pursue their ambition to become islamic scholars. the wall-magazines at the entrance of one block, however, betray the turmoil in the school. one wall-magazine called jihad addresses the ""clash of civilisations"" issue and warns students against the motives of the west. the young students say they are more concerned with the world situation than the outcome of the assembly elections in uttar pradesh. ""one of our professors is a brilliant speaker; he said the other day that america is a terrorist state,"" said a student. the octogenarian rector of the institution, however, refuses to be drawn into polemics. ""i took part in the freedom struggle. at the time of partition, we opposed the muslim league and islamic fundamentalism,"" marghoobur rahman said. the rector said he was not concerned about the elections and had not extended support to any of the contenders. there have been no politicians lining up outside his door nor has he given his blessings to any one of them. ""i only want that fundamentalist forces on either side should not come to power,"" rahman said. he said he was distressed by union home minister advani''s remarks against madarsas. reminded of the charge that many of the taliban leaders had studied at dar-ul, the rector dismissed it as disinformation. he claimed that for many years, visas had not been issued to foreign students who wanted to come to deobandh. but ""if they do not come here, they will go to some institution in pakistan and go home with a poisoned mind,"" he argued. his deputy abdul khaliq claimed that though 800 students passed out of dar-ul every year, none of them had ever been involved in any terrorist activity.

18,Nuclear engineer out to rewrite laws of physics,"karwar: call him a magus, sorcerer, conjurer or a genuine practitioner of modern science. and the contraption that he carries around sure makes one''s head go a-whirr. for the record, paramahamsa tewari, former chief project engineer of the kaiga atomic power project, is a nuclear engineer. but he appears a conjurer with his space power generator (spg) that gives an output of 2.5 times the energy fed into it. tewari''s spg and the theory on which it is based will certainly demolish the foundation of modern physics. the spg is different from the conventional electrical generators which operate on lenz''s law and the law of conservation of energy. according to the law of conservation of energy, in an isolated system, energy can be transferred from one form to another but the total energy of the system remains constant; lenz''s law states that an induced current in a closed loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. in the conventional generator, while operating electrical power, a generator causes reaction on the prime mover in direct proportion to the output such that the output energy cannot exceed the input even if the generator is 100 per cent efficient. tewari said a low voltage high current (direct current) generator can produce more output energy than its input. this is because its reaction on the prime mover, while delivering power, is much less than the conventional generator. in this machine, the configuration of the electrical conductors in the generator with respect to the magnetic field is different from the conventional machines. when fully developed commercially, it will be the most useful generator for power supply to electrolyzers, producing hydrogen and oxygen at low cost, and for other applications in chemical industry. in machines above 50kw, part of the output power can be fed back to drive its own prime mover, with efficient and specialised current collecting sliding contacts (brushes). tewari explained that the spg operates on the theory of rene descartes space vortex which postulates a non-material massless fluid entity called ether in the universe. he said the spg was ready for commercial production. he said he had worked on it for 14 years. for three years beginning 1998, the crompton company gave tewari rs 30 lakh for experiments. the crompton company asked for higher capacity of the spg which could not be done with the existing infrastructure, he said. the three-year contract with the crompton company has now ended. he said there was a lack of interest about the spg in india since new things were not encouraged. having demonstrated the operation of the spg which yielded electricity at the rate of 2.63 kw for an input of 1 kw of electricity, he said he would give his spg for commercial production to anyone who came forward to do so. he said he had been invited to deliver a guest lecture on the spg theory with slides at second berlin congress for innovative energy technologies, 2002, which would be held in berlin from june 13 to 15. he hinted that foreign companies might get interested in commercial production. if the spg could succeed as an economically and commercially viable project, it should be hailed as a revolutionary manifestation in the energy- and fuel-starved world.

19,New Rent Control Act fails to enthuse lawyers,"mangalore: though the new rent control act of 1999, which came into force from december 31 last year, clears some ambiguities on some issues, it has given scope for litigation between the landlord and tenant in some aspects, observed senior advocates p. madhav rao and m.v. shankar bhat here recently. they were delivering lectures on the `new rent control act'', organised by the management and old students association of sri dharmasthala manjunatheshwara law college along with the mangalore bar association at the sdm law college here. they said the new act replaces the previous karnataka rent control act 1961 and according to the preamble of the act, it is based on model rent act framed by the central government. the advocates felt that the new act makes serious departure from the old one and has several provisions having far reaching consequences on the rights and obligations of landlords. they observed that due to the sudden implementation of the act, the government has failed to create sufficient awareness among the general public on the provisions provided to the tenants and the landlord. the advocates also deliberated on the protections offered to the tenant and the limitations in accordance with the new act. the symposium mainly focussed on important aspects of the likes of rent enhancement and fixation, rent fixation of commercial establishments, rent agreement procedures among others. commenting on the new act, rao said the law had its share of both lacunae as well as positive aspects despite the fact that it seemed inclined in favour of the landlord on certain counts. now that the act has been enforced, it is necessary that the government takes initiative to educate the general public on the important clauses of the act. rao said the new act would be implemented in mangalore city corporation limits as well as udupi city limits and not small towns like moodabidri, puttur, karkala, mulki, bantwal etc. he also dealt on length about the sub-letting clauses, the rent payable, the tenancy rights in case of the death of the owner, at which rate of rent the act is applicable, the rights of the tenant and the landlord and so on. the act has also provisions for penal action if the landlord or tenant fails to furnish particulars demanded by the rent controller, he added. the symposium was attended by a sizeable crowd.

20,Pvt educational firms up in arms against govt orders,"bangalore: two separate notifications issued by the education department have spurred opposition from private educational institutions. the department on february 1, 2002 issued the notifications controlling private educational institutions and making it mandatory for institutions to provide ancillary services to students. according to the karnataka educational institutions (control of private educational institutions) rules, 1999, the governing council can collect and utilise fees only as per the government rules. the rules also make it mandatory for all institutions to intimate the details of receipt of voluntary donations to the block education officer within 90 days from the date of receipt and deposit the amounts as directed by the beo. each institution should send details of movable and immovable property to the competent authority on or before january 1 of each year. on the other hand, the karnataka educational institutions (ancillary services in recognised educational institutions) rules, 2000, makes it mandatory for all educational institutions to arrange for medical examination of students. the head of the institution should maintain the health record of each student and the expenses in respect of medical examination of students -- providing medicine should be met out of the medical fees collected from students. any shortfall should be borne by the institution. the notification also asks institutions to provide adequate library facilities to students and to take steps to stop the sale of unhygienic or harmful food, drinks or eatables in or near the premises. to protest against the notification about the control of private educational institutions, the associated managements of primary and secondary schools in karnataka (kams) has convened a meeting of managements on february 13 to discuss the rules pertaining to the control of private educational institutions. ``several rules under the notification are very stringent affecting the day to day management of educational institutions. it infringes on certain fundamental rights and imposes unreasonable restrictions. similar rules under different acts have already been held invalid by the court,'''' association general secretary k.s. krishna iyer said. the rules pertaining to providing ancillary services should be welcomed. however, educational institutions role should be confined to conducting medical examinations and not distribution of medicines. ``once the medical reports are finalised, parents can buy the medicines,'''' iyer explained.

21,National security main issue in polls: BJP,"jalandhar: the bjp on tuesday asserted that national security was the main issue in the coming assembly elections in four states. ""the opposition parties have objected to raising national security in the election campaign, but how can such an important issue be ignored in the assembly election as it is concerned with the whole nation,"" bjp general secretary sunil shastri told reporters here. ""we have succeeded in isolating pakistan in various international fora on the issue of terrorism,"" he said, ruling out any possibility of talks with the neighbouring country ""unless and until it acted on india''s demand for handing over of 20 criminals."" referring to the ram temple as an emotional issue, he said that appropriate steps would be taken at appropriate time to maintain status quo of the disputed site as per the order of the supreme court. when asked whether the government would take preventive steps such as seizure of carved pillars for the ram temple in view of the vhp''s warning to start construction from march 15, shastri avoided a direct answer, saying the issue would be resolved through negotiations. to another question whether bjp had any tacit understanding with the bsp for the formation of the next government in uttar pradesh, shastri claimed that bjp and its allies would get a clear majority in the state.
