0,Mob turns violent in Godhra,"VADODARA: At least six tear gas shells were lobbed to disperse an irate mob which resorted to stonepelting during a demolition drive near Mesri river on Sunday. Four persons were reportedly injured in the incident, which took place when officials of the Godhra collectorate along with the police began razing shanties on the riverbed.

Senior officials were concerned as the locality has residents from both communities. Sources said, senior leaders from both communities had to intervene to pacify the violent mob.

According to officials, the demolition drive was conducted peacefully thereafter and nearly 60 shanties were razed. The second phase of the drive will be carried out soon, they added.

The deputy collector had undertaken the demolition drive after the issue of illegal encroachments in Godhra was raised in the Gujarat Assembly, added sources.

It was pointed out that these encroachments were being used by numerous bootleggers and gamblers as shelter places. Godhra district collector D H Brahmbhatt said, ""One of the ministers had assured in the Gujarat Assembly that these encroachments would be removed. We had to carry out the demolition on the basis of a report from the state assurance committee.""

1,Left may not join govt,"NEW DELHI: The CPM won''t join the government, save a dramatic turnaround by its leadership in its meeting which has started just now.

As CPM''s central committee began its deliberations here, it was clear that the majority view in the party''s top decision-making body didn''t favour either joining the government or signing on for the common minimum programme. The final decision would be announced on Monday afternoon.

The refusal of CPM to join the government would keep the whole Left contingent sitting out. CPI, which broke ranks in 1996 to join the UF government, has this time indicated that it would go by the common view.

The Forward Bloc and RSP, the two other constituents of the Left Front, support Congress only at CPM''s behest.

So far, the majority in CPM''s 77-member central committee appears to be against the idea of joining the government.

There is also a view that if CPM does not join the government, it should keep away from formulating a common minimum programme.

It is argued if the party stays out, it cannot implement the CMP and, hence, there is no point in sharing the blame for any misdeeds of the government.

If this view carries, then CPM would extend issue-based support to the government. Those who favour this argument say that in the 1996-98 UF experiment, CPM could not influence P Chidambaram''s policies.

2,Look who gatecrashed Sonia's party,"NEW DELHI: Not having received an invitation for the Sunday dinner Sonia Gandhi hosted for her allies and those deemed ""like-minded parties"", Mulayam Singh Yadav took off for Lucknow this afternoon.

But the UP chief minister need not have worried: batting for him was political marksman Harkishan Singh Surjeet. The CPM general secretary leaned on Congress and made sure that Mulayam''s SP and Ajit Singh''s RLD would be part of the next government.

Just as the Congress camp from UP and allies such as Laloo Yadav were beginning to feel relieved that the threat of SP forcing its way into the ""Congress and allies"" tent and reducing the size of the ministerial pie was receding, Surjeet sprang his surprise.

A shrewd practitioner of political brinksmanship, the CPI(M) boss told TV crews that exclusion of Mulayam Singh from the meeting of secular allies was ""not the right thing"".

He said that there must have been a ""communication gap"". This put Congress in a fix.

Going by its own ""stop BJP"" rhetoric, it would look churlish to deny Mulayam an invite.

The Surjeet-Amar Singh-Ajit Singh appearance added a dramatic element of what would have otherwise been a routine meeting to elect Sonia Gandhi leader of the alliance.

DMK''s M Karunanidhi proposed her name and RJD''s Laloo Prasad Yadav seconded it.

3,CM keen to cut govt ad spending,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy appears to be keen on cutting down government publicity expenditure in sync with his poll statement that the TDP government had spent a whopping Rs 350 crore per annum for the same and that this amount could very well be diverted to give free power to farmers.

Though this figure is disputed by I&PR officials on the ground that the annual budget for the department is only Rs 50 crore, they concede that the erstwhile government had allowed individual departments to go in for publicity on their own.

On many occasions, the previous government had paid a whopping Rs 5 lakh to each TV channel for live telecast of programmes like Dwcra meetings and other ones attended by the chief minister.

Sources close to the chief minister point out that he had strongly opposed releasing full page colour advertisements to newspapers about his swearing-in ceremony, when the chief secretary and other officials had called on him soon after he was elected the CLP leader to discuss logistics of the function.

It took a while for the officials to convince Rajasekhara Reddy, after which he had ""reluctantly"" agreed to issuing not more than half-a-page of black & white ads in some newspapers.

But it remains to be seen whether he would be able to continue with a low profile style of functioning and cut down on a number of publicity functionaries who were hired by the earlier government even outside the regular information & public relations department. Within the chief ministerâ€™s office (CMO), Rajasekhara Reddy is unlikely to allow the position of Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO) become as important and high profile as it was during the previous regime.

Though the previous CPRO was only of deputy director rank in the I&PR department, he had been able to wield considerable clout by virtue of his proximity to the chief minister.

Rajasekhara Reddy is likely to depend on some of his close associates with whom he has been familiar as CLP leader during the last assembly for all his media relations.

4,BJP to focus on assembly polls,"PATNA: The State unit of BJP on Sunday decided to organise meetings at block headquarters and remote villages from July as a part of its preparations for assembly elections due next year. The party will make road, water and power its main poll plank in assembly polls.

Senior BJP leader and former leader of opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi while addressing state executive committee meeting of the party, felt that state leadership should organise block, panchayat and village level meetings in the coming months to highlight the failure of the state government on law and order and development fronts. Majority of rural masses still do not know that providing road, water and power was the lookout of the state government, Modi told TNN.

Modi said thousands of villagers still thought that providing water, power and roads was the responsibility of the local MPs. The party must launch an awareness campaign in this regard, he said. Modi, who was elected to Lok Sabha (LS) from Bhagalpur parliamentary constituency on May 13, said that he would tour villages for six months to highlight state government''s failure on various fronts.

State BJP president Gopal Narayan Singh, former state president Nand Kishore Yadav and Ravi Shankar Prasad also addressed the members of state executive and presidents of district units of the party on this occasion. BJP will again convene the meeting of state executive after May 31 to analyse the reasons behind the poor performance of NDA in LS polls. All BJP candidates in the Lok Sabha and their election in-charges would also attend the meeting along with the district presidents. Prasad expressed hope that the BJP would win the Chhapra and Bettiah seats.

Singh asked the party leaders and workers to launch public contact programmes in Chhapra, Bettiah and Siwan in view of the LS elections in Chhapra on May 31 and repoll in the other two constituencies on May 24.

Several senior leaders of the party including Sanjay Paswan and Hukumdev Narayan Yadav, state vice-presidents Satish Jha, Ramdev Yadav, Arun Sinha and Dilip Verma, general secretaries Giriraj Singh and Nityanand Rai, treasurer Janardan Singh Sigriwal and party MP from Katihar Nikhil Chaudhary were prominent among those attending the meeting.

5,Did EC 'rig' rulebook on Chhapra?,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission''s decision to countermand the election in Chhapra on the basis of widespread booth capturing and rigging has left a number of legal issues unanswered.

EC spokesperson A N Jha maintains that countermanding does not mean that the process has to begin all over again with a fresh notification being issued.

But this statement completely reverses the guidelines as laid out in the EC''s handbook for candidates prepared for the 2004 general elections.

The handbook clearly states, ""If the election is countermanded by the EC on account of booth capturing, all proceeding for that election will commence anew and a fresh notification for the election will be issued in due course.""

When Jha questions as to why the EC was not bound by its own order, he cited the Delhi High Court''s 1993 judgment (Amar Pal Singh vs CEC).

In 1991, after the EC countermanded elections in Meerut, Purnea, Patna, Bulandshahr and Etawah, Meerut candidate Amar Pal Singh went to the Delhi HC against the commission''s order.

The HC had said that countermanding does not mean that the process has to begin afresh. After this, the EC approached the Supreme Court.

The apex court left the issue open, with the commission promising the SC that it would change the law and the future interpretation would be in the light of the changed law.

In this connection, a Bill to amend the Representation of People Act was introduced in Parliament in 1994 but it lapsed in 1996.

Finally for 2004 general elections, the EC handbook clearly states that countermanding means the whole process has to begin afresh. This leaves the question whether the EC is bound by its own instruction or not?

According to lawyer Nitya Ramakrishnan, ""When the Delhi HC gave its judgment, EC could have accepted it. But it chose to challenge it in the SC and adopted a course endorsed by the latter whereby the HC judgment was limited to that particular election alone. The SC clearly said that it left the interpretation open for future cases.""

Legal experts point out another issue regarding countermanding the Chhapra election. Laloo Prasad Yadav, who contested from Chhapra and Madhepura, has already won from the latter constituency.

Yadav could have easily opted out of the race in Chhapra had a fresh notification been issued. Now, he has no choice but to remain in the fray. In case, he wins from Chhapra and choses to vacate the seat, Chhapra would see three elections in a span of a few months.

It was for situations like this that the SC in the Amar Pal Singh case had said, ""...the framers of the Constitution took care to leaving scope for exercise of residuary power by the ECs in its own right, as creature of the Constitution, in the infinite variety of situations that may emerge in such a large democracy as ours. Every contingency could not be foreseen, or anticipated with precision.""

6,Cong-NCP tie-up offsets saffron gains in LS polls,"MUMBAI: Though the Shiv Sena-BJP combine has added a phenomenal 20 lakh votes to its 1999 statewide tally, its electoral gains in the state have been neutralised by the consolidation of the Congress-NCP votes.

While the Sena-BJP polled 125.8 lakh votes in 1999, it got 146 lakh votes this time. Yet, the saffron parties'' seat tally has actually shrunk from 28 in 1999 to 25. In fact, the vote share of the saffron combine has actually shot up in 31 out of 48 constituencies.

Despite this, they lost in 11 of them because of the Congress-NCP tie-up. Part of the increase in vote share can be explained by the growth in the number of voters. But percentagewise too, their vote share has grown from 38 per cent to over 42 per cent.

Statistics show that the anti-incumbency factor helped the Sena-BJP but this did not translate into winning mandate in most of the seats because of the consolidation factor.

In Kopergaon, a stronghold of Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil, the Shiv Sena actually performed marginally better than it did when it fielded Vikhe-Patil in 1999. This time, Vikhe-Patil stood on Congress symbol and won.

In one of the most stark cases, the Congress-NCP combination wiped out the Shiv Sena in Ichalkaranji though the latter recorded a quantumleap fromone lakh votes in 1999 to 3.2 lakh votes.

Likewise in Karad, the Sena got one lakh votes more than the last time but still lost to the NCP which got an additional 86,000 votes this time. The Sena ended up losing in Kolhapur with 3.87 lakh votes (against 1.63 in 1999) and in Satara (2.7 lakh votes against 1.88 in 1999).

Amravati posed a curious electoral puzzle where the Congress-NCP''s combined might did not work its magic. Though the Sena''s vote count dropped by over 1.15 lakh votes against its 1999 total, it retained the seat.

In Mumbai South-Central too, a 50,000 drop in vote count could not prevent Sena''s Mohan Rawle from winning, thanks to the split in votes among Arun Gawli (Akhil Bharatiya Sena) and Sachin Ahir (NCP).

The BJP, similarly lost Ahmednagar, which it held in 1999, though it polled 10,000 votes more. Sangli saw the BJP improve its tally from under a lakh to 2.2 lakh but it nevertheless lost to the Congress.

As it did in Pandharpur, an RPI bastion, after posting a gain of about one lakh votes. It lost to Dalit leader Ramdas Athavale whose score dropped from 4.13 lakh in 1999 to 3.47 lakh votes.

In Pune, BJP''s Pradip Rawat, who had won in 1999 with 3.04 lakh votes, polled just 4,000 short of that count but ended up losing to Congress'' Suresh Kalmadi. In Baramati too, the BJP has not really lost too many supporters.

It scored about the same number of votes (2.11 lakh) as it did in 1999 (2.12 lakh) but predictably lost to Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar.

The BJP suffered similar reverses in Nandurbar and Mumbai North. In Nandurbar, it got 2.44 lakh votes against 1.51 lakh votes last time and yet lost the seat to the Congress, while in Mumbai North, BJP stalwart Ram Naik''s vote share of 5.11 lakh was marginally less than his winning tally of 5.17 lakh in 1999.

Despite this, rival Govinda of the Congress romped home with whopping 48,000-vote margin.

Among the constituencies where the Sena-BJP alliance emerged victorious, it posted huge gains over its own score of 1999; Thane (over two lakh), Washim (1.14 lakh), Aurangabad (90,000), Khed (1.4 lakh), Parbhani (90,000) and, of course, Solapur (1.07 lakh votes), where the BJP candidate defeated CM Sushilkumar Shinde''s wife.

The Sena recorded a huge slide in Congress heavyweight A R Antulay''s constituency, Kulaba.

Its share dipped by 60,000 votes over last time while the BJP too had a shockingly poor showing in RSS heartland and Nitin Gadkari''s hometown, Nagpur, with its tally dipping from 3.52 lakh votes in 1999 to 2.74 lakh. They lost both seats.

7,Cong-led govt may slow down on economic reforms: Wisner,"NEW YORK: A former US Ambassador to India Frank G Wisner said the Congress led coalition government in India may slow down - but not alter - the economic reforms and efforts to improve relations with Pakistan.

The instinct of the Congress-led coalition, particularly the leaders of the Congress party, he said, will be inclined towards stability. But expressed reservations about the stability of the coalition and said country might see another general elections in matter of a year.

Pointing out that the Congress had launched the economic reform in the early 1990s, he said ""on the reform front, and even on the Pakistan front and the China normalisation front, Congress has a strong record, and it would want to stand by it.""

Noting that some 50 members of the Communist party would be in coalition, he said in an interview that some more drastic reforms, particularly in the field of privatisation and labour, would be harder to obtain, ""unless they surprise us.""

""But for openers it will be tough, and they will have to work very hard to make those sorts of reforms happen."" he added.

Referring to the Indian foreign policy, Wisner said Atal Bihari Vajpayee wanted to make real progress on relations with Pakistan and ""set aside"" the ""quarrel"" on Kashmir before the end of his political life.

13,SAD(Badal) dissidents may form new Akali Dal party,"PATIALA: Dissidents of the Shiromani Akali Dal ( Badal ) may form a new Akali Dal before the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbhandhak Committee (SGPC) elections which is scheduled to be held on July 11.

Former member Parliament and a dissident Jathedar Tarlochan Singh Tur, who had contested the recently held Lok Sabha election from Taran Taran seat against the official candidate of Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), talking to the TNN said that soon a new Akali Dal of â€˜trueâ€™ Akalis would be formed and its candidates would be fielded in the SGPC elections.

Tur said, â€œIn fact we want to bring all the Akali factions except SAD (Badal) on a common platform and revive the â€˜realâ€™ Akali Dal under the leadership of dedicated and honest Akali leaders like Prem Singh Lalpura or Surjan Singh Thekedar.â€� The former MP said that talks were being initiated with the leaders with SAD (Ravininder) president Ravi Inder Singh, SAD ( Amritsar ) president Simranjit Singh Mann, leaders of Barnala faction like Baldev Singh Mann, senior Akali leader Inderjit Singh Jira, former union minister Balwant Singh Ramuwalia and many other like minded people who want to revive the great spirit and traditions the Akali Dal.

SAD ( Badal ) president Parkash Singh Badal, responding to a question here on Monday said that formation of bogus Akali Dals was a part of the policy of the Congress party. Talking about the Akali Dal ( Ravinder ), SAD ( Asr.) and other small time Akali Dals, he said that there were the agencies of the Congress government working against the Panthic interests. He said that the SAD ( Badal ) was ready to contest the SGPC election and would prove again that it was the real Akali Dal.

Former SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar, while talking to the TNN here on Monday also said that the Congress was behind the move of Tur and others. He said that after the shameful defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the Punjab chief minister might go to any extent against the SAD ( Badal ). He said even in November 2002, at the time of election of the SGPC president, he had left no stone unturned to harass the members of the SGPC belonged to SAD ( Badal ) by imposing section 144 in the entire state forcibly lifting the party activists.

The former SGPC president alleged that the CM would again make all out efforts to snatch the SGPC from SAD ( Badal ) by getting formed a new party in the name of Akali Dal. He said that the people who were playing in the hands of the Congress party should keep in mind that they had already been rejected by the people just a few days ago in the LS elections.

Tur has denied that charges that the Congress was behind their move. He said that their only mission was to make the SGPC free from the clutches of people like Badal who had tarnished the image of Akalis by indulging himself at high scale corruption.

14,Cong leaders persuade Karuna to join govt,"NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leaders K Janardhana Reddy and Ghulam Nabi Azad on Monday met DMK President M Karunanidhi, apparently to persuade his party to join the Sonia Gandhi-led coalition government at the Centre.

15,Denial of judgeship to women lawyers discussed,"CHANDIGARH: The denial of due representation to lady lawyers in elevation as judges of the high courts and the Supreme Court of India and the urgent need to initiate remedial steps to restore balance in this regard was strongly voiced by majority of the speakers and others who participated in the seminar held on Sunday at the new bar complex of Punjab and Haryana High Court here.

It was not without significance that the seminar which was organised by the lady members of the high court bar association and attended among others by a number of judges of the high court, highlighted the rather raw deal handed out to women advocates by the powers-that-be in not finding even one of them to be eligible enough or adequately equipped for elevation to the Bench. This depressing scenario, the speakers from the fraternity were quick to point out, continued to persist despite good work done by women judicial officers and the lawyers.

Daya Chaudhry the former president of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association set the ball rolling by raising the issue of discrimination against women advocates in regard to giving them due representation by recommending them for elevation to the Bench. It was wrong to presume that women perhaps were not in a position to do such a job well, she said and added that women judges have acquitted themselves well. Daya Chaudhry besides well known advocate Sangeeta Dhanda, Gargi Kumar joint secretary of the bar association were among those who collectively planned the the seminar '' Role and Status of Women in Legal System.''

Punjabâ€™s additional advocate general Nirmaljit Kaur was forthright in pointing out that women as members of the bar and even those who were elevated from amongst the judicial officers, showed remarkable capability to cope with the demands of the judicial work. Going by the records alone, one came to the conclusion of continued lack of recognition to the women lawyers in terms of elevation to the Bench, Nirmaljit Kaur added.

However, Amarjit Kaur Khurana said elevation to the bench apart, not a single lady lawyer had so far been even designated as a senior advocate which appropriately sums of the situation. Sangeeta Rai Sachdeva a judicial officer posted in the district courts, Chandigarh, said she had not encountered any kind of discrimination so far.

Addressing the participants Justice G.S.Singhvi called upon the women advocates to work hard as this alone would help them in carving a place for themselves under the sun. Justice Singhvi said he had the opportunity to sit with four different women judges and all of them did their work well. Justice Kiran Anand Lall who presided over the deliberations favoured greater participation of women for strengthening the legal system. Dr Satya Nalwa, former dean of law faculty, Punjabi university, Patiala, Dr Sangeeta Bhalla, a professor in the PU law department, Chandigarh, were among those who spoke about the need to accord appropriate role and representation to the women in the legal system.
