1,Jilani files suit against minister,"LUCKNOW: The convenor of the All-India Babri Masjid Action Committee Zafaryab Jilani filed a suit for recovery of Rs 5 lakh as damages against waqf minister UP Shakir Ali on Thursday in the court of civil judge (senior division). The court has issued a notice to Ali for filing his written statement on April 16. Also, April 23 has been fixed for framing of issues when the parties will have to file their documentary evidences.

The suit was filed on the grounds that Ali had made defamatory remarks against Jilani on December 18, 2003 at Jawahar Bhawan on the occasion of Minorities Day and had also alleged that Jilani had occupied waqf land in Gomtinagar, which would be vacated from him.

A notice for damages and apology was served to Ali on December 19 in this respect by Jilani. However, it has been stated, Ali had neither issued an apology nor had he made payment of any amount for damages.

It has also been stated in the plaint that Jilani was Mutawalli of waqf Ganje Shaheedan, Gomtinagar, or of other waqf properties in his capacity as secretary Anjuman Ishlahul Muslimeen and not in his personal capacity and, as such, he could not be said to be in possession or occupation of any waqf property in his individual capacity. Moreover, the waqf property was being managed by the plaintiff for protection of the same.

Meanwhile, president of All-India Muslim Welfare Committee Mohammad Wasim Siddqui and Anjuman Islahul Muslamin member Sohab Ahmad have taken strong exception to the suit.

The two Muslim leaders said Jilani was trying to put pressure on Ali, intimidating him so that he might not pursue this case against him (Jilani), said the leaders, adding that the court fees borne by Jilani comes from the coffers of the Anjuman Islahul Muslamin which serves orphans. They said that Jilani had been trying to scuttle any probe that might expose him and his friends.

2,Absconding grand-kids of Bihar minister found,"MUMBAI: The police say it is a case of a minor kidnapping minors. But the kidnapped refute this strongly.

The four grand-daughters of Bihar revenue minister Ramai Ram who went missing from their Patna residence on February 22, were traced to Hotel Sea Lord at Carnac Bunder on Wednesday night.

The police found the four sistersâ€” Ujjwala Rani (16), Shweta (15), Khusboo (14) and Varuni (12)â€”at the hotel with Ujjwalaâ€™s classmate from Don Bosco School in Patna, Sayyed Umar (16).

The girls told TNN that they had run away after their parents reprimanded them sternly for a â€œpetty reasonâ€™â€™, but the Mumbai police refused to buy this theory and said there was more to the incident than met the eye.

â€œWe suspect Umar lured the girls to Mumbai. We have booked him for kidnapping and he will be handed over to the Bihar police,â€™â€™ said deputy police commissioner Himanshu Roy, who led the rescue team. Umar is now at the Dongri remand home.

But the girls have a different story to tell. Ujjwala, who was in tears when she spoke to this correspondent, said in fluent English, â€œI was upset when my mother scolded me andmy sisters for a petty reason. We decided to run away. We first went to Calcutta, where we slept on the platform before boarding the Howrah Mail toMumbai. We travelled ticketless.When we came to Mumbai, a taxi driver guided us to Hotel Sea Lord, where we booked three rooms at a daily rent of Rs 1,200 per room.â€™â€™

She claimed that Umar was already in Mumbai and that she contacted him only after arriving here. â€œHe came to our hotel and spent two nights with us. He tried to convince us to go home, but we refused. He is innocent and has not kidnapped us.We have come here voluntarily,â€™â€™ she said.

Inspector Manmohan Tiwari from Patna said that when the girls went missing, a complaint was lodged at the Sachivalaya police station.

Umar, whom the girlsâ€™ father suspected of kidnapping his daughters, was also missing from his home in Patna around the same time. Vikash Verma of Property Guards said that his firm assisted the Patna police in their search.

The breakthrough came when Ujjwala called up her home in Patna from her hotel room. The Patna police traced the call and a team arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday and alerted the Mumbai police. The hotel was searched and the girls found.

The girlsâ€™ mother, Geeta Devi, is a Rashtriya Janata Dal MLC. Minister of state for home Kripashankar Singh said he has spoken to the family in Bihar. â€œAfamily member will come to Mumbai to take the girls home,â€™â€™ he said.

3,SC rule forces state to sack additional A-G,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Thursday sacked additional advocate general P. Janardhanan.

The decision came in the wake of a January supreme court ruling that said the post was not a constitutional one.

Legal sources said the state had expected Mr Janardhanan to step down after the apex court order. â€œHe, however, continued in the post despite being assigned little work by the state,â€™â€™ the sources added.

The government finally had no choice but to revoke its earlier order appointing him.

Mr Janardhanan was on a monthly retainer of Rs 3,000 and was entitled to legal fees per appearance of up to Rs 7,000 per day.

The supreme court has ruled that the state can have only one advocate general in a constitutional post and he can even address the state assembly if necessary.

4,Rail minister unveils 'greater Patna' map,"PATNA: The creation of ""greater Patna"" is possible only when the people of the state will oust the RJD-led government and hand over the reigns of administration to a new leader, said railway minister Nitish Kumar.

Unveiling the map of ""greater Patna"", as envisaged by JD-U, here on Thursday, Kumar said the greater Patna means a fully developed and affluent Patna, which would be as beautiful as Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi.

""Every year there is a mass exodus of students here due to the lack of good institutions and jobs. But the time is not far away when such facilities would be available in Bihar also and the students need not go outside the state,"" he said.

He further said after the construction of All India Institute of Medical Science no body will go outside for treatment.

""Similarly, all necessary infrastructure of education will be created here,"" he said and appealed to the people in general and party workers in particular to ensure 100 per cent victory of the NDA candidates in the forthcoming polls.

Supporting the demand of JD-U Legislature Party leader Upendra Kushwaha to include Hajipur in the map of â€œgrater Patnaâ€�, he said today the demand has come from Patna Mahanagar unit of the JD-U, but it would soon be the demand of other political parties and orgnisations also.

According to Mahanagar unit of the party, the â€œgreater Patnaâ€� will have 57 wards of Patna and complete area of Danapur, Phulwari and Sampatchak blocks upto Punpun embankment.

5,Promotion policy angers IPS,"KOLKATA: Several top cops in the state are aggrieved by two decisions of the West Bengal government.

They believe that a senior officer has been elevated to director general of police, bypassing other senior officers, while another, due to retire in a month, has been denied promotion as an additional DG.

In both the cases, the â€˜annual confidential reportâ€™ presumably scuttled their chances, although their service records are impressive. The IPS Association intends to take up the matter with the government. But before that, its president ADG (traffic) T. Chattopadhyay has written to all members seeking their views. The letter, a copy of which is available with TNN, states, â€œTo say the least, there is danger of arbitrariness and discriminatory treatment in deciding on promotional cases, when the same set of officers handle both the ACR writing and promotional matters.â€�

The discontent has been brewing for long. On February 23, the association wrote to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, urging him to address the grievances. The association had earlier written a letter on December 15 last year. It cited a recent Supreme Court ruling which said that ACR had to be written by an officer immediately superior in the same service. The directive was not implemented in the state. The apex court had asked the state governments to issue suitable orders. The state police directorate has sent a copy of the ruling to the home department for implementation, but without effect. The SC ruling came in the case of the state of Madhya Pradesh vs T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad case)

The letter also claimed that the lack of a proper transfer policy had left IPS officers demoralised. Only a regular transfer policy, it said, could â€œeradicate discontent among IPS officers in the matterâ€�. The letter to the chief minister pointed out that the DG and the commissioner of police were yet to get financial powers of a departmental secretary. This privilege had been given to almost all erstwhile directors, such as those in charge of health and forest. The association said the IPS were being denied several benefits given to the IAS.

While the latter were given pension on the day of retirement, the former were made to wait. The government had instructed the accountant general on November 26, 2001 (No. 4802-PARIAS) to release pensionary benefits to IAS officers of West Bengal cadre on the date of retirement, but not to other all-India services personnel. â€œ...This is discriminatory and is ultra vires to the Constitution which in article 312(2) has created both the IAS and IPSâ€�, the association observed.

6,Ten incidents of carjacking in 30 days,"NEW DELHI: As many as 10 incidents of car jacking have been reported in the last 30 days in the city. In most of these cases, which took place mainly in northwest and west Delhi, the car owners were robbed of their vehicle at gun point.

Northwest Delhi seems to have been the worst affected with two such incidents being reported within an hour on Tuesday night. A Toyota Qualis owned by a private firm was robbed in the Pitampura area.

The driver was returning to Shalimar Bagh after dropping an employee. Barely 45 minutes later, an Indica owned was robbed in the same area. In both cases, the accused used a locally-made pistol.

Similarly, two carjacking incidents took place in west Delhi within a span of five minutes.

A Toyota Qualis was robbed from its driver while he was returning to Moti Nagar after dropping passengers in Jahangirpuri at 2 am.

At 2.05 am, another call was received by the police that a Toyota Qualis had been robbed near Punjabi Bagh flyover. In both the cases, the accused were young men armed with locally-made pistols.

Meanwhile, the northwest district police on Thursday cracked down with the arrest three men said to be behind the spate of carjackings reported from the district. Two locally-made pistols and four live cartridges were seized from the accused.

""The gang mostly targeted Qualis, Santro and Indica cars with a single occupant. The cars would then be parked in Metro rail parking lots in Vivekanandpuri and Pratap Bagh,"" stated DCP (northwest) Sanjay Singh. Three Toyota Qualis, two Maruti 800 and a Santro car has been seized from the accused.

In another incident, the southwest police arrested three men after an encounter in the Najafgarh area. They were allegedly involved in three cases of carjacking which took place in Dwaraka and Najafgarh recently.

The accused were found travelling in a Zen car which had been robbed from a businessman in Najafgarh on February 23. ""The accused had also robbed an American Express employee of his Tata Indigo at Dwaraka on February 27. We are trying to verify if they were involved in other cases as well,"" said DCP (southwest) Tajendra Luthra.

He admitted that incidents of carjacking had increased in southwest Delhi. ""They were targeting businessmen carrying cash. These incidents took place in broad daylight on busy roads,"" added Luthra.

7,"Boards or not, Sachin, Shoaib rule","NEW DELHI: March may be a ""happening"" month, courtesy Holi, the Indo-Pak cricket series and the election buzz. But the excitement seems to have made life more ""difficult"" for students bearing the Board burden.

The hapless souls toiling away amidst mountains of books and notes feel that the ""temptations"" offered by the eventful month are simply far too great to be brushed aside.

""To see or not to see"" appears to be the latest dilemma in thousands of homes across the city. What''s more is that the question is a ""critical"" one not just for students but for their parents as well.

""I''ve reduced my television viewing to one hour and have put restrictions on my husband as far as the idiot box is concerned. Parents have to make such small sacrifices if they want their children to do well,"" says Surjeet Kaur Monga, whose son is appearing for the Class XII examinations.

""I am fond of keeping up with news discussions on television. However, with my son taking his Class XII Boards, 10 pm is the line of control for switching on the TV,"" confessed a father.

Students of course can''t stop blaming the authorities, the calender and the gods themselves for such ""unfair"" turn of events.

""India-Pakistan cricket series on Pak soil! The temptation is too great to be resisted. I''ll watch the match on the 16th after the chemistry exam and the one on March 19 will be a celebration of the end of my Board ordeal,"" declared Amanpreet Singh, a Class XII student of Guru Harkrishan public school.

Most parents seem to agree that keeping children (and themselves) completely away from the excitement is a near impossible task. While many feel that a bit of television provides the much needed break from studies, caution must be exercised on Holi.

""As a parent my prime concern is to ensure that my daughter is not getting stressed out before an exam. A bit of fun is always a good idea. So we will celebrate Holi. However, only dry organic colours or gulal will be allowed,"" said Jayashree Joshi Eashwar, whose daughter is appearing for the Class X examinations.

8,Vote of change in school admission rules,"KOLKATA: The admission season is on and the great â€˜rat raceâ€™ for admitting oneâ€™s child in elite schools has started.

Parents are running from pillar to post, lest they lose out in the race. AC Nielsen ORG-MARG conducted an opinion poll for The Times of India on the admission procedures followed by major English medium schools and came out with some startling answers.

More than half the parents felt the admission procedures need to change here. Half felt the admission procedure is extremely stringent compared to Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore.

About 60 per cent also felt admission procedures are not clear and transparent in any respect. Interestingly, 70 per cent felt interviewing parents along with the child was part of an â€œideal admission procedureâ€�, and three out of every four parents felt it should continue. This system, they say, should continue till schools come up with a clearer admission procedure.

Most parents (80 per cent) feel studying in a kindergarten school prior to taking admission in a premier English medium school does help. More than 55 per cent felt students who have attended a recognised preparatory or kindergarten school should be given preference over others in matters of admission. A large proportion (80 per cent) feel each renowned school should have its own kindergarten branch.

Two-thirds donâ€™t want the Mumbai pattern, where children living near a school are given preference over others.

And close to 60 per cent felt that in order to give others a fair chance, children who have secured admission in a school should be disqualified from seeking admission in other schools.

9,The Godmother rules supreme over this port city,"AHMEDABAD: She has the demeanour of a homemaker and mother. And Santokhben Jadeja was upset when Shabana Azmi portrayed her character in the movie Godmother with a cigarette dangling from her lips.

Santokhben''s wrath does matter in Porbandar a fishing and industry town in of Gujarat where Gandhi was born 135 years ago. Here, she''s called Godmother after Azmi based her portrayal of a female don on Santokhben.

Her grip over the city is absolute, but wielded with a light touch. And of course, she plays a huge role in determining the city''s political contours.

Godmother donned the mantle of underworld queen after her husband, the dreaded gang leader Sarman Munjha, was killed in intra-gang warfare in 1986. Azmi''s movie based on crime in Porbandar shows a powerful underworld character out on a violent spree to avenge her husband''s death.

Urban legend has it that Santokhben has since led a group of 100 men drawn mostly from Gujrat''s Mer community.

Police records show that at its peak, in the late 80s and early 90s, the gang had nearly 525 criminal cases registered against it. And nine of these cases, including those of murder, were against Godmother herself.

But not many know that Munjha''s meteoric rise as a mafia don of Porbandar actually began in the 50s when he killed one Devu Vaghela, a local hoodlum allegedly hired by Nanji Kalidas Mehta, the owner of Maharaja Mills, to break the communist trade union.

Mehta is the grandfather of cement baron Jay Mehta, husband of film actress Juhi Chawla. Juhi''s name is being considered by the BJP for the Porbandar seat. So if one is talking about Juhi and politics, one naturally has to take into account the presence and influence of Godmother.

The film of course upset Santokhben and the Mer community, which remains fiercely loyal to her because the lady does not smoke cigarettes.

She believes that to gravitate from crime to politics is logical. In December 2002, Godmother, who was an MLA from 1990 to 1995, filed her nomination papers for the Kutiyana assembly seat but later withdrew in favour of the Congress candidate when she found her brother-in-law and arch rival, Bhura Munjha, contesting on a Samajwadi Party ticket.

Other ganglords like Ebha Arjan, Iku Gagan Siyal and Bhoja Kana have also tried their hand at politics in Porbandar.

Things haven''t changed much in Porbandar since Gandhi set sail for South Africa more than a century ago. One thing that''s changed however, is that fishing mafias which earlier thrived on smuggling have found new turf: real estate, immigration, transport and politics.

The present BJP MP from Porbander, Gordhan Javia, is under a cloud because Canada is probing an alleged immigration racket involving his sons. Elections in Porbander have always brought to the fore intense caste strife in this coastal belt located at the western tip of Gujarat.

Though the Patels constitute nearly 24% of the electorate, it''s middle caste Mers (11%), Ahirs (10%) Kolis (5%) and Kharvas (4%) and 14% Muslim folks who''re often at odds with each other. Babubhai Bokhariya, a senior BJP leader, says ""Caste wars are mainly between the Kharvas and the Mers over economic supremacy in the area.""

Either way in Porbandar, don''t get in the fray unless the dons are with you.

The Lok Sabha constituency comprises the assembly segments of Porbandar, Kutiyana, Dhoraji, Upleta, Mangrol, Manavadar and Jamjodhpur.

When Javia won in 1999, he got handsome leads in all these seven segments. But during the 2002 assembly elections in Gujarat, the Congress won in three - Dhoraji, Porbander and Mangrol.

Which just shows that the fight for Porbander is closer than other constituencies in Gujarat where the BJP is more comfortably placed. And that''s where the now dormant gangs will come in, to swing the tide one way or another.

Says Samat Odedara, a Congress leader from Porbander, ""threatening voters and candidates through muscle power during elections is common in Porbander"". Hey Ram!

10,NTPC raises $200 m for investment plans,"NEW DELHI: India''s largest power utility National Thermal Power Corp on Thursday announced the successful completion of $200 million external commercial borrowing, more than half of which came from Europe and the US.

""We raised $200 million through a 7-year Euro Bond issue at very competitive rate of 5.5 per cent,"" NTPC chairman and managing director C P Jain said.

The bond issue was part of NTPC''s requirement to borrow Rs 50,000 crore in the next eight years for its investment plans.

""NTPC priced a Regulation S $200 million inaugural bond issue at 99.370 per cent to yield 5.5 per cent, equal to a spread of 205 basis point over the 7-year US treasury,"" he said.

The final allocation saw 45 per cent of the issue placed with investors in Asia, 47per cent to Europe and 8 per cent to US offshore accounts. By investor type, asset managers took 39 per cent, banks 32 per cent, pension/insurance 17 per cent and retail/others 12 per cent.

""We are pleased with the results of our debt bond offering. NTPC has been able to capitalise on current market conditions to look in attractive 7-year funding. We have now set a new benchmark that will facilitate future fund raising exercises by the company,"" Jain said.

NTPC director (finance), P Narasimharamulu said, ""We have cultivated a new group of international investors and diversified the company''s source of funding. These objectives are key to the company''s growth strategy going forward.""

NTPC had appointed Merril Lynch and ABN Amro Bank as joint lead managers for the issue, Jain said.

The initiative to hit the global market came close on the heels of a mega deal signed by NTPC with Life Insurance Corporation for borrowing Rs 7,000 crore at an interest rate of 6.5 per cent.

11,Two former ministers to join Cong: Bhajan,"HISAR: ""Three legislators and two former ministers of Haryana would join Congress party on March 9"", disclosed Bhajan Lal, president, HPCC, while talking to newsmen at his residence here on Friday.

The Congress leader kept their names in suspense but informed that the formal joining would take place at Congress headquarters on that day at Delhi.

Former Minister Jaswant Singh was today present in the press conference of Bhajan Lal. He is expected to declare his entry to the Congress at Delhi on March 9.

Commenting on the Ranjit Singh''s admission to the BJP Bhajan Lal said,"" The indications were clear after the Fatehabad by-election. He has no influence among the masses. He would lose his security deposit if he contests the Lok Sabha election from Hisar.

Haryana Vikas Party and BJP would fail to open an account in Haryana during Loksabha polls. ""Only INLD is likely to give some fight to Congress in one or two constituencies and Congress is going to win all the ten seats in Haryana.""

Bhajan Lal said, ""HPCC is seeking time from the party highcommand for the second phase of road show of Sonia Gandhi in the segments left out in the first road show in the state ie Kurukshetra, Ambala and Karnal. The success of the road show has prompted us to cover the whole state.""

Replying to a question Bhajan Lal said,"" Lal Krishan Advani has drawn the right picture of Haryana. As Home Minister he knows the manoeuvering of O P Chautala and that is why he has appealed the voters to go with Congress in case they do not opt for BJP.

The INLD rule in Hayana would not last beyond next August. There are chances for alignment of Congress with BSP. In Haryana we shall our candidates by March 15. The survey for the winning and strong candidates is already being conducted.

12,PTU students stage rally,"JALANDHAR: Students of Punjab Technical University who have gathered from different colleges of the state staged a rally and later resumed the hunger strike on the PTU campus to press for implementation of the 24 credit rule which they claim was changed after they had taken admission.

The 2001 batch is facing difficulty on getting promoted to the 6th semester as a result of

the change in rules. The students gathered at DeshbhagatYadgar Hall and from there marched to the PTU campus.

There they sat in dharna for two hours. Swaranjit Singh, SFI state secretary spoke on the consequences of commercialisation of education. The gates of the PTU campus which had been sealed were opened and some students were allowed to have a meeting with the PTU authorities.

Meanwhile a group of students marched to Railway Road where they blocked traffic to register their protest.""The truth is that the PTU introduced the new set of rules after the 2001 batch was admitted,"" said Gurpal Singh, vice-president of SFI.

The V-C, Dr SK Salwan, when contacted on phone said ""the 240 credit rule existed in 2000. The 2001 batch were informed about the new rules."" Meanwhile, 10 students resumed the hunger strike on the PTU campus.

13,"Quake, kisan push Kutch's political Richter up","AHMEDABAD: ''1,28,364'' may sound an innocuous number. But, Kutch is waking up to its power now. For, it constitutes a magic number that may make or mar the fortune of politicians in the country''s third biggest constituency.

It is the new voters of Kutch and, though they constitute a small percentage of the 10,00,347 strong electorate, politicians are losing sleep over this number.

It is the victory margins of the winning candidates in Kutch in 1998 and 1999 â€” 61,000 and 4,000 respectively â€”that are sending shivers down their spines.

Analysts say it is this voter that will swing it any way. And, it is this voter that seems to be unhappy. If the earthquake was faced with stoicism, it was the apathy in rehabilitating them that has shaken them. Its aftershock may well be a disaster in the making in Kutch''s political battleground.

Analysts also indicate that though the new voter is a potent factor, a host of other issues hover over the political horizon in this land marked by vast expanse of inhospitable land and a long stretch of fragile border.

Keeping the graph of Kutch''s political Richter scale high will be the burning issue of a kisan movement that is gaining alarming proportions and the region''s caste politics. Even the Narmada waters, brought to the district with much fanfare last year, is yet to reach large areas.

And, adding salt to injury was the state-of-the-art Bhuj Hospital, the prime minister''s magnum opus for quake-ravaged Kutch that belied expectations when the promised AIIMS tag never came its way.

In 1999, the kisans had reduced the winning margin of BJP MP Puspadan Gadhvi to a measly 4,000 when it called for a boycott of the election over the issue of bringing the Narmada waters to Kutch.

This time too, the signs are ominous with the kisans in a foul mood again, peeved over the electricity tariff issue and the crackdown on them.

Then, even three years after the earthquake,Kutch residents are still virtually out in the open, mostly in the urban areas of Bhuj, Gandhinagar, Bhachau, Anjar and Rapar where rehabilitation work has progressed very slowly.

Sources say the TP schemes have been finalised only now and total reconstruction of Bhuj alone will take another year, even as allegations of a major scam â€” touching about Rs ..... crore â€” in debris removal has vitiated the minds of the voter.

If Kutch had anything to cheer about â€” the Rs 130-crore hospital dubbed the Atal Mahal â€” poured cold water on their hopes when it remained a cosmetic addition, with no AIIMS status coming its way nor the promised world class medical facilities being provided.

Analysts also believe that voting may take a different shape in a post-Godhra Gujarat though Kutch remained insulated from the communal strife.

They feel, its proximity to the border could prove to be a bigger influence, especially when Muslims constitute a whopping 22 per cent of the electorate.

The political constitution too has changed after the 2002 Assembly polls.

When the rest of Gujarat went with the saffron surge, Kutch gave Congress a ground to breathe on â€” from one out of six constituencies, Congress now has four in its kitty.

This explains why leaders swung into action well before the elections were announced.

If Chief Minister Narendra Modi rushed to Geneva to get the ''asthikalash'' of freedom fighter Shyamji Krishna Verma and installed it in his ancestral house in Mandvi, Keshubhai Patel has been holding hectic parleys with the two dominant Patel communities in Kutch, the Leuvas and Kadwas.

Political watchers say Modi''s move may well have been targeted towards the Bhanusalis, who form quite a strong force.

Kutch has also shown an affinity for its sons of the soil. If Gadhvi, who hails from Nakhatrana, has been to the Parliament thrice, MM Mehta, a physician known for his philanthropy, won in 1971 and 1980. And, it was Himmatshinji of the Kutch royal family who had won its first election in 1962.
