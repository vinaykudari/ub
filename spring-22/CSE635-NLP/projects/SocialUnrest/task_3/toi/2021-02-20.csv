2,'State will go by rule book on Sonia's security',"HYDERABAD: The Congress need not have any doubts about the state government''s ability to provide security to the AICC president Sonia Gandhi, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said on Friday.

Allaying fears expressed by some Congress leaders on Thursday, Naidu told reporters at NTR Trust Bhavan that the TDP may have ideological and political differences with the Congress party. It also opposes Sonia Gandhi becoming the Prime Minister of the country. But this does not make us blind towards discharge of our duty.

Naidu said the state government will provide full security to the AICC president whenever she visits the state. The state government goes by rule book on such issues, he said.

Naidu also favoured funding of elections by the state. He said a detailed debate on this was necessary and political parties should come to a consensus so that a legislation could be brought in. This would reduce poll expenditure and would be a major electoral reform.

Earlier, addressing 5000 party volunteers at NAC grounds who are undergoing special training in crowd management for Vijayabheri, Naidu criticised Congress party and its policies.

He said a country which stood as one and opposed British rule, can never accept Sonia Gandhi. Vote for Sonia would be a matter of shame for the country, he added. He said it was unfortunate that the TRS had mortgaged the pride of Telangana to Sonia Gandhi and the party led by her.

4,Fernandes assails Rabri govt,"SITAMARHI: Describing Bihar as a fit case for imposition of President''s rule, NDA convenor George Fernandes said on Friday if voted to power, the ruling alliance would definitely consider bringing the state under central rule.

""Bihar is a fit case for imposition of President''s rule. NDA thrice tried to bring the state under President''s rule, but failed due to lack of majority in the Rajya Sabha. If NDA is voted back to power, it will definitely consider bringing the state under central rule to end the corrupt and inefficient RJD regime,"" Fernandes told a public meeting at Chorauth block of the district. He said the Laloo-Rabri rule proved to be the ""darkest"" era in the state. PTI

""Law and order has worsened. No development is taking place ... People are fed up with the inefficient and corrupt administration under Rabri Devi,"" he said and appealed to the people to ""teach them a lesson"" in the coming Lok Sabha polls.

Fernandes said the NDA government by approving a large number of development schemes in the field of railway, power, road and other sectors had tried to pull the state out of backwardness, but due to lack of matching efforts from the state government, the objective could not be achieved.

Local JD(U) MP in the dissolved Lok Sabha Nawal Kishore Rai also assailed the RJD ministry. PTI

A delegation led by the state JD(U) president Gautam Sagar Rana, comprising Lalchand Mahto and Tarkeshwar Singh, rushed to the central party leadership and apprised them of the mood of party rank and files in the state.

The party leadership kept its voice mum on the issue and defered its decision till month end. George Fernandes and Sharad Yadav informed the delegation that the issue would be decided in Ranchi on March 1. The JD(U) also hurriedly called a rally on the fateful day to counter the BJPâ€™s plea.

6,Madhuri's fan irked at Haryana govt's move,"RANCHI: Noted film actress Madhuri Dixitâ€™s admirer Pappu Sardar has done it again.

The â€˜dhak-dhakâ€™ girlâ€™s fan who has been celebrating her birthday religiously for years now- sometimes with the physically challenged at Jamshedpur-based Cheshire Home or at the Old Age Home- now wants to give Rs 1.75 lakh to the Haryana government as payment for a plot of land at Panchkula, which was given away by chief minister Bhajan Lal to the actress at government rate.

Not ready to listen to any logic Pappu is angry with the Haryana government for sending a notice to the actress for paying the amount. â€œIt is not that she will not be able to pay, but I appeal to the Haryana government to accept my offer through the media,â€� he argued. Later, he said the plot of land could be used as an old age home or a home for the disabled, he added.

According to Pappu, newspaper reports suggest that Bhajan Lal had offered a plot of land to Diksit at a government rate of Rs 2.35 lakh, of which she had already paid an initial amount of Rs 60,000. On February 15, this year, the Haryana government reportedly served a notice to Madhuri asking her to pay up the remaining Rs 1.75, failing which, the land would be allotted to somebody else. Donning a â€˜Devdas kurtaâ€™ with images of Shahrukh and Madhuri, Pappu says that this will make him very happy for if he can do something for somebody who is his inspiration and who made him what he is today. No regrets if Madhuri has not once acknowledged his existence or the good work he is doing in her name.

â€œWe pray to God and make many offerings in His name, but is it necessary that god reciprocates?â€� he asked. Pappu who used to celebrate Madhuriâ€™s birthday by offering free plates of â€˜chaatâ€™ to the residents of the Steel City, now spends his time on the occasion at the Cheshire Home and has even donated a park for children of the home. The Madhuri fan also celebrates â€˜rakhiâ€™ at the home and with senior citizens at the old age home.

But Pappu would not like his inspiration to join politics. â€œActors should expose politicians and not run after politics,â€� he said.

11,No tariff increase by Tata Power,"MUMBAI: Tata Power Company on Friday proposed a change in tariff structure without increasing the tariff, to encourage economic use of resources by consumers and progressively move towards structure which reflected the cost of supply.

In its tariff rationalisation proposal submitted before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), TPC also proposed a franchisee system under which a franchisee would provide power to the individual industrial and residential units from a single bulk supply point at a commission of 10 to 15 paise/Kwh on TPC''s prevailing HT and LT tariff.

The company said that pursuant to the rationalisation, the overall revenue realisation for TPC would reduce marginally by about Rs ten crore.

""The rationalisation is essentially aimed at reducing anomalies in tariff structure and is not expected to substantially alter the aggregate revenue realisation from individual categories/licencees,"" it said.

It also proposed two bands of tariff while adopting Time-of-the-Day tariff for bulk licencees, Railways, and HT category of customers to increase consumption during the night hours when there is low-peak time.

""If power consumption increases during night it would reduce the demand on utility to set up capacity to meet peak demand,"" TPC said.
