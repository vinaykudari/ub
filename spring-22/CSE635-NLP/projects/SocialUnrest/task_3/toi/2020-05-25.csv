1,Lucknow Development Authority has nothing to lose,"LUCKNOW: The Viraj-Vineet Khand impasse seems to have its roots in a policy designed to make optimal use of all useless land owned by the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) even as the anguish of around 400 allottees is overlooked by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. An allottee of the erstwhile prime land in Vibhuti Khand, where now the new Gomtinagar terminal spread over 40 acres is being built, said that the Vibhuti Khand commercial land scheme was a failure because of the flyover constructed on the main road. The final nail in the coffin was the permanent closure of the Railways' level crossing. Prime property had lost its value. And what was the need to shift the Gomtinagar terminal proposed site from the Malhaur station to the Gomtinagar station? questioned an allottee while himself providing the answer—Only because it suited the LDA! The LDA board conveniently passed a proposal to convert land-use elsewhere for its 34 acre land. The 88 allottees, of which 69 will be affected and 43 even have their properties registered have not, however, been provided any alternative. Similarly, while the Northern Railways (NR) refuses to part with its 23 acre land in Vineet Khand, the LDA land here had already rocked the High Court, according to an allottee, over the High Tension Wire because of which the allottees had refused to take possession. If the Viraj Khand allottees are shifted to Vineet Khand, the useless LDA land will be utilised. Also, there was no necessity to make a loop in Viraj Khand, according to another allottee, as only after approximately 600 metres was the Malhaur station, from where the trains could return, instead of wasting money on constructing a loop to connect NR and NER tracks separated by more than a kilometre. It will take approximately 10 acre in Viraj Khand 1-2 to make the loop. Moreover, just before the Malhaur station is a yard owned by the Railways, which apparently is lying vacant. The loop can be made there if absolutely necessary. While an allottee, who is also an engineer, says that the yard land is suitable for making the appropriate bend, DRM NER VK Dutt, however, is convinced that the loop must be in Viraj Khand for an appropriate angle. Dutt, probably unaware of the 'motive', however, assures that they will reach an amicable solution to the problem. Likewise, secretary LDA, Rekha Gupta also says that as they have got the revised plan from the NER, they will see which plots are falling in the loop. Those plots would not be registered, she said. However, she brushed aside the allegation that the policy had been made to benefit the LDA. Meanwhile, more that 230 allottees of the Viraj Khand will be displaced but whether it will be to the Viraj Khand land beyond the railway line or to the Vineet Khand, nobody is sure. Officials say that they are still negotiating. Viraj Khand, even otherwise, remains controversial. Though legally the LDA cannot register the property if the area is not developed, most of the plot owners have their properties registered.

2,"Dilawar was not drunk, says family","NEW DELHI: The family members of the Indian driver, Dilawar, who was allegedly killed by the son of Senegal's ambassador on Saturday night, said the deceased never consumed liquor on duty. ""He drank occasionally,"" said his brother Pankaj. The driver reportedly died in a scuffle over car keys of the diplomat's Nissan car (number 97 CD 1) at city's Taj Palace Hotel. The family was reacting to allegations that the deceased was inebriated and the envoy's son, Mansoor Ali, wanted to drive the car himself. Pankaj said: ""Our mother allows us to consumer liquor only inside the house. She had warned us against getting drunk outside."" The family also wondered how Dilver got engaged in a scuffle and that too with his employer's son. ""He was cool-tempered and the neighbours remember him for always going out of his way to help others,"" Pankaj said. The deceased was from Solan district in Himachal Pradesh and lived with his two brothers and widowed mother in Pushpa Vihar for over 15 years.

3,Four arrested for prostitution in city,"CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh police on Sunday arrested three girls and a man, all residents of Delhi, on charges of prostitution. The girls were allegedly members of a dance troupe which indulged in flesh trade. The police claimed that they had received information about the involvement of Delhi girls in the sex racket. The mobile phone numbers of these girls had been circulated among many prospective clients in the city. The police on Saturday set out to lay a trap. A deal was struck for Rs 10,000 over a mobile phone with a known pimp, Kiran, based at Rajouri Garden in Delhi. A meeting was arranged outside a discotheque in sector 9. A decoy customer handed over a wad of notes to Amit Sharma, the man who was to provide the girls. As soon as Sharma accepted the money, the police standing nearby nabbed him. The girls, sitting in a car parked nearby, were also held. The girls were identified as Tisha (20), Kavya (21) and Divya (25), all from Delhi. Tisha and Kavya told the police that they were residents of Rohini while Divya said that she had recently shifted to Panchkula. A case under various sections of the Immoral Trafficking Act has been registered. The accused were remanded to one day police custody. Investigations revealed that the girls were frequent visitors to Chandigarh and various other cities of Punjab. Sources said that a police team will be sent to Delhi to arrest Kiran after acquiring her arrest warrants from the court.

4,MCD defers fund allocation over protests,"NEW DELHI: After protests over alleged improper budgetary allocation to each ward, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) commissioner, Rakesh Mehta, has shelved the ward-wise allocation of budget till the year end. The commissioner also constituted a 6-member committee to review allocations and make recommendations. ""A number of representations have been received relating to the allocation of budget to each ward.

As the matter is streamlined, the ward-wise allocation shall be kept in abeyance till December 31,"" the commissioner said. The commissioner shelved his recent order on zonal planning committee for deciding how the funds would be utilised. Raising objection against the allocation of budget, the leader of opposition Subhash Arya said the way funds were earmarked amounted to straitjacketing of the allocation.

5,Action against 18 govt doctors recommended,"CHAPRA: Saran district magistrate Baijnath Mishra told mediapersons on Tuesday that he plans to form a special task force to improve the education scenario in the district. He also said that different schemes, like Annapurna and Antyodaya, will be implemented in the district properly. Saran civil surgeon Sudhir Mahto, who was also present at the press meet, admitted that number of kala azar cases has increased in the district. He said that the names of 18 doctors, who were found absent from their respective places of posting, have been sent to the state headquarters for suitable punishment. Absence of anaesthetist hampers surgical operations in Sadar hospital and so most of the patients are referred to Patna, said the CS. The DM directed the CS to serve notices to private nursing homes to procure incinerators. The superintending engineer (electrical) stated that the district gets only 5-7 MW of power daily against the requirement of 15-20 MW. When asked about billing without metre reading, the executive engineer (electrical) said there is dearth of meter readers in the district. Regarding the damage bridge at Shitalpur Atti, the DM said that he is personally supervising the repairing works and essential materials have been brought from Kolkata. Refuting all charges regarding irregularities in grant of arms licence, Mishra said that they have been granted as per rule.

6,Jinxed SEZ policy worries Modi,"GANDHINAGAR: Showing clear signs of unease over the failure to form of new special economic zones (SEZ) to attract fresh investment, Chief Minister Narendra Modi has directed top officials of the state industries department to speed up the long-pending work to finalise the SEZ Bill so that investors have at least a legal framework to work on. Showing signs of impatience, the CM wanted quick results, but gave no directions on how to expedite the process at a time when the SEZ policy remains just on paper, said a senior bureaucrat participating in a meeting on SEZ taken by Modi. The reasons for the CM's concern were many. Though a state SEZ policy was out in July 2002, top industries bureaucrats say, things have not moved. There has been, in fact, deceleration. After two free trade zones, Kandla Free Trade Zone and Surat Export Processing Zone, were converted into SEZs, the expectation of coming up with new SEZs at Positra, Mundra, Dahej and Hazira has been belied. Positra, which was proposed to be developed by Nikhil Gandhi, is in hibernation. Officials complain, the developer has just disappeared from the scene and no one knows what is the latest status. Said a top bureaucrat, He has not been in touch with us at all. We do not know what he wants. Proposed on 10,000 hectares, its land acquisition process is still not complete. The CM was told, it was to bring in an investment of Rs 9,300 crore. Yet, the Centre has refused to environmental clearance for a proposed port to be set up along with the SEZ. The SEZ proposed at Mundra, much smaller, was to be developed by the Adani Group just near the Mundra Port it owns. The state government put up a request with the Centre to develop the SEZ at Mundra — which was to get an investment of Rs 663 crore — a year ago, yet nothing happened. The Adanis have enough land, yet things are at a standstill. As for the other two proposals, for Dahej and Hazira, they have failed to attract even a developer. This despite the fact that the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) has enough land to develop the two SEZs. Further, the policy to have SEZs in the state, out in July 2000, remains unimplemented because of lack of a legal framework. The management of the SEZs was to be under the designated development commissioner who was to grant all the permissions as single point clearance from his office. None knows when this office will come up. The commissioner was to give all types of environmental clearances. A legal framework was required to declare SEZs industrial townships or notified areas, allow the developer to set up independent power plants for generating and distributing power, approve power connections and carry out billing of units in SEZ, and allow units to set up captive power plants. The legal framework was to allow a simplified version of the labour laws. The industrial units in SEZ were proposed to be declared as public utility service under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act. Then, the legal framework was needed to formalise concessions and exemptions in electricity duty, stamp duty, registration fees on transaction of land as well as financial agreement, deeds etc., sales tax and other state taxes. Finally, there was to be an 'exclusive arrangement within the SEZs for law and order'. Whether it means converting the SEZs — deemed foreign territories — into prohibition free zones is not clear.

7,Tension in Navayard after groups clash,"VADODARA: Tension prevailed in the Navayard area of the city after groups belonging to two communities were involved in a confrontation. Policemen on duty in the area had to rush to the spot to bring the situation under control. Officials in the city police said that the area near the Navayard mosque has a sizeable population of both the communities and has been a flash point for trouble in the past. Earlier, there had been clashes after Gulbaharkhan Pathan — a noted criminal in the area — was abducted and killed on May 1, by alleged rivals. Sources at the Fatehgunj police station said that on Saturday night tempers ran high in the area after some persons made remarks about those from the other community, who were sitting nearby in a group. In no time, mobs belonging to the two communities gathered there and started using foul language against each other. A posse of policemen posted in the area, following the violence on May 1, rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control. Senior officers from the Fatehgunj police station, including police inspector B V Rabari, have camped there in wake of the tension. Rabari said that a large number of people in the area sit outside their houses due to the heat. There was some altercation amongst some of the people who were sitting outside and this led to the trouble. However, the incident was quickly brought under control, he said. However, rumours regarding the incident having its roots in the gang rivalry between supporters of the Keri brothers and other criminals, circulated in the area. The brothers, Ashok Keri and Dilip Keri, have been absconding since the murder of Pathan and have been named as accused in the murder case. Rabari, however, said that the incident on Saturday night was spontaneous and were not related to gang rivalry.

8,Police arrest four in Lal murder case,"PATNA: The police are learnt to have picked up at least four persons including, one alleged notorious criminal, Dharmendra, from different places in the city in connection with the sensational murder case of professor S Lal. Earlier, on Saturday, Lal was shot dead in Bazar Samiti area while moving in his Maruti Zen car. Sources said the four persons are being interrogated by a special police team to get the clues behind the murder.

10,Less marks drives student to suicide,"HYDERABAD: Peer pressure and intense competition over scoring marks claimed the life of an Intermediate student on Sunday who set himself afire at his residence in Jawaharnagar in Banjara Hills. K Subba Reddy, 17, doused himself with kerosene and set himself afire. He was alone at home when he attempted suicide after locking the doors from inside. While his uncle Eswar Reddy was away at work, his aunt, who had gone out for purchasing vegetables, spotted Reddy engulfed in flames when she returned home. She broke the doors with the help of neighbours and rushed him to Osmania General Hospital. Reddy, who suffered over 80 per cent burns, succumbed in the afternoon. Banjara Hills sub inspector A Srinivasa Rao said Subba Reddy was a student of Narayana College in Sanjeevareddy Nagar and opted for MPC group. In his first year, results of which were announced recently, Reddy scored 15 marks less than his friend. Though he paid the fee for 'improvement' exam and was preparing for it, Reddy appeared to have felt humiliated, the SI said and added that it was not clear whether he was admonished by his lecturers in the college. Banjara Hills police have registered a case. Incidentally, Subba Reddy is the fourth Intermediate student to commit suicide in the last seven days.

11,CID to 'fight' for incentives,"HYDERABAD: Taking a cue from the Anti-Corruption Bureau, officials of the Crime Investigation Department (CID) too have decided to 'fight', albeit quietly, for a 30 per cent incentive in wages. The CID officials have been asking the government for long for the 30 per cent incentive and better facilities. However, the government did not accept the proposal so far, while a similar proposal made by the ACB was accepted by the government a couple of weeks ago. Since a majority of the officers consider CID as one of the 'loop line' postings and are not too keen to work in the department, the senior officials had been trying to get the 30 per cent incentive so that officials work whole-heartedly. Now that their counterparts in the ACB have been provided with the incentive, the CID officials too want the same 'motivator' to be extended to them. Sources said the CID officials raised this issue during a meeting to decide the modalities for 'reorganising' the department on Saturday. It is learnt additional director-general of police (CID) M L Kumawat had assured his men that he would try and get the 30 per cent incentive from the government. The meeting also decided to have six regional command centres - Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati, Kurnool and Warangal. The officials dropped an earlier plan of having another centre at Guntur. Two vehicles are being given for each newly created regional centre to ensure mobility. Each inspector of the CID will be given a cell phone and other modern gadgets for effective investigation, the sources said. The sources, however, said that the idea of having four SP rank officers at Hyderabad was not discussed in the meeting due to some administrative complications.

""We condemn the proposal for the unity of the Left Front,"" Guha, also the state agriculture minister, told a party workers rally at Kolia More in Howrah district. Those who were floating such idea had vested interests, said the Forward Bloc chairman who was, however, very vocal against the CPM alleged torture on fb workers during and after the recently concluded panchayat elections. Forward Bloc is a coalition partner of the ruling Left Front partner in West Bengal.

14,Mamata alienates two party MPs from city,"KOLKATA: With the Trinamul Congress resolving to take disciplinary action against party MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay, two of the three of its MPs from the city may now be in the rebel camp. Party chief Mamata Banerjee's distance with Bandyopadhyay, MP from Kolkata North-west, was growing after Mamata walked out of the NDA in the wake of the Eastern Railway bifurcation. It reached a flashpoint after the BJP offered a ministerial berth to Bandyopadhyay against Mamata's wishes. Kolkata North-east MP Ajit Panja is all but out of the party for criticising Mamata's decision to tie up with the Congress in the last Assembly elections. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee sounded worried on Sunday when asked if this could affect the prospects of the party in the next parliamentary election, less than a year away. ""I am not thinking at that level now,"" he said. He thought, however, that there was no possibility of a split in the Trinamul immediately. Observers pointed out that erosion was taking place in the party where it would hurt it the worst, as Kolkata had been the stronghold of the Trinamul. All the three parliamentary seats in the city are in its kitty, Kolkata South being held by Mamata herself. Eleven Trinamul MLAs are also from Kolkata. The next parliamentary polls would, indeed, be an acid test if various Trinamul leaders had separate political identities of their own, or if they had been basking in the reflected glory of Mamata Banerjee, they said. ""In the last parliamentary polls, I had toured extensively the North-west constituency at Sudip's request,"" Trinamul MLA Paras Dutta said. ""His trump card was Mamata's image."" Dutta did not deny though, that Panja had won from the Kolkata North-west a number of times, but drew comfort from the fact that no Trinamul MLA had sided with him after he broke away from the party. Opinions differed on whether West Bengal would stand to lose, now that it seemed that the Trinamul had once again missed the bus for the Union Cabinet. The party could have served the interest of the state, even with a portfolio like coal or civil aviation, agreed Dutta. Mukherjee felt, however, that the time was too short. ""The election is due next year and it would have taken a minister a few months to understand the new department."" Mamata's insistence that Serampore MP Akbar Ali Khondakar be chosen over Bandyopadhyay in the Union ministry once again underscored the dilemma facing the party of joining hands with the BJP while the minorities were one of its main support bases. ""We have become a victim of wrong propaganda regarding minorities,"" Dutta said.

16,Cong to protest against Amethi renaming,"LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh Congress is chalking out a strategy to lodge its protest over the renaming of Amethi. The party plans to hand over the responsibility of the campaign to its Dalit leadership to counter chief minister Mayawati. The party unit will contest the government's decision to rename Amethi after Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, who has no relevance in Uttar Pradesh, said Congress spokesman Akhilesh Singh on Saturday. Protest dharnas and demonstrations have already started in the newly-carved district with eminent Dalit leaders heading the campaign to drive home the point that the people there - cutting across caste lines - were not happy with the renaming of the place. Amethi owes its development to the Congress and the Gandhi family, Singh said. People here cannot be divided on caste lines to serve the political motives of the BSP, he added. On Friday, the local party unit and the youth wing held a protest rally in Gauriganj, which has been made the district headquarter of the new district. The Congress leaders from Amethi are likely to meet governor Vishnu Kant Shastri soon to submit a memorandum in this regard. The Congress has not ruled out a legal recourse over the issue and is looking into the details, said Singh. The symbolic use of Dalit leaders to head the protest against the renaming of Amethi gains significance in the backdrop of Mayawati's attempts to counter the Congress influence in the area by first holding an alert rally to warn the Dalits against ""the Congress designs"" and, secondly, by renaming it after a Dalit icon. Meanwhile, the people of Amethi have expressed reservations over the new name.

17,BJP shadow Cabinet in MP ahead of polls,"BHOPAL: On the lines of the Parliamentary practice in Britain, the Opposition BJP in Madhya Pradesh has formed a shadow cabinet in the state ahead of the next assembly elections. ""The legislators included in this cabinet have been alloted departments and its first meeting is scheduled to be held here on June 8,"" BJP sources said on Sunday. The chief minister of this shadow cabinet is BJP's star campaigner Uma Bharti, who has already been named as the party's chief ministerial candidate for the state. Legislators, who have been made members of the shadow cabinet, have been told to make preparations about the departments allotted to them so that this information can be used to prepare slogans, pamphlets and posters for the assembly elections. Based on the recommendations of this cabinet, the BJP would finalise charges against the Digvijay Singh government, the sources said. This would also be useful to draft BJP's manifesto for the next assembly elections. The shadow cabinet has been formed to make BJP's legislative wing more active before the assembly elections in the state. State BJP president Kailash Joshi and its organising secretary Captain Singh Solanki would be present at the first meeting of the shadow cabinet.

18,PIL challenges use of English by government,"MUMBAI: The Rashtrabhasha Mahasangh has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Bombay high court, challenging the constitutional validity of the Official Languages Act as amended in 1968 to ensure continuance of English as the official language of the Union. The litigation, filed by president of the Rashtrabhasha Mahasangh and former high court judge D R Dhanuka, urged for a direction to declare the Official Languages Act ""unconstitutional"". It is expected to come up for hearing in the first week of June. According to section 3(5) of the Act, English would continue to be in use until a resolution for discontinuance of English for official purposes was passed by legislatures of all states which have not adopted Hindi as an official language. But this did not authorise Parliament to postpone the implementation of Article 343 (1), the PIL said. It argued that Parliament had the exclusive jurisdiction to enact an appropriate law in this regard and state legislators had no jurisdiction in the matter.

21,Mufti invites Sonia to address public rally,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has invited All India Congress Committee Chief Sonia Gandhi to address the first ever public rally in north Kashmir on June 1. Sonia Gandhi, who is to arrive here on May 30, will be addressing a public meeting at Baramulla in north Kashmir, soon after conclusion of the two-day meet of the 5th Congress Chief Minister Council (CCMC)on June 1, the Congress sources said. The programme of Gandhi to address a rally was not included in the itinerary earlier, he added. This will be the second public rally of Sonia since state Assembly elections were held October last. The state Congress executive committee, which met here on Sunday to finalise the programme of Sonia Gandhi's visit to valley, resented involvement of People's Democratic Party. Most of the congress leaders, who are already peeved with the style of working of the state government led by PDP, asked the state leadership to keep the PDP ministers, particularly Muzzafar Hussian Beig and Gulam Hussian Mir, away from public rally to be addressed by Sonia Gandhi at Barmulla. The Mufti, according to the sources, invited the Congress chief to address the public rally at Baramulla, highly militant infested district, to neutralise the public image of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Congress chief was unhappy with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed after he arranged public rally for Vajpayee at Srinagar last month. The Congress ministers and leaders had boycotted the Prime minister's public meeting. Congress in the Kashmir valley was put on the back burner after Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's PDP formed ministry with the support of the Congress. Mufti has tried to adjust every executive member of his party into the government. Though congress MLAs have been given the charge of vital ministries yet PDP ministers dominated every department in the state, says Gulam Rasool Kar, a senior state congress leader. He said he was astonished to learn that state finance minister Muzzafar Hussian Beig of PDP conducts meetings concerning power department held otherwise by Mohammad Sharief Naz of the Congress.
