3,'Bihar govt apathy delayed Central assistance',"patna: the leader of opposition in the state assembly sushil kumar modi on thursday said that the failure on the part of the bihar government to send the account number of its calamity relief fund (crf) to the centre had delayed the release rs 52.73 crore to it for the current year. the state government's contribution to the fund would be the tune of rs 17.58 crore, he said. modi said although the government had opened a separate bank account two month ago to deposit crf after a delay of almost five years, it was yet to send the account number to the centre after seeking permission from the account general (ag). modi, who on wednesday visited aurai (muzaffarpur) said that union minister of state for agriculture sripad naik assured an nda delegation that the centre would release rs 52.73 crore to bihar as soon as it received crf account number from bihar government. the nda delegation, led by the state bjp chief nand kishore yadav, had demanded launching of ""food for work programme"" in flood and drought-hit areas of the state. modi said that the nda would soon launch a statewide agitation to demand the resignation of rabri devi government for its failure to tackle the law and order situation. the bjp leader described the aurai police firing as a clear case of state terrorism. he said that in aurai people were being given 7 kg wheat every week to each flood-affected family even as the government had announced to distribute 25 kg wheat per week. modi said that the state government would have been in possession of rs 130 crore crf, had it sent its account number to the centre after opening the account as it would have enabled it to launch relief operations in the 62 flood-affected blocks of the 13 districts in a big way. he, however, said that the government still had more than rs 60 crore unspent crf of last year at its disposal to undertake relief work since it had to cover only 62 flood affected blocks. criticising the inadequate relief operation, modi said that the rabri government had so far released only rs 2 crore for relief work of which rs 1 crore was given to gopalganj district, the home district of the cm. he said that of 90 per cent of the fund released to the district was being spent to distribute relief materials in gopalganj assembly constituency represented by rjd mla sadhu yadav, the younger brother of the cm.

""so long we had confined our function to only political activities inside parliament. it had been a mistake,"" a prominent left front mp said from delhi on friday. ""from now on, we will also act as ambassadors of our state and convince the centre to invest more for the development of west bengal,"" he said. as a part of his strategy to tap all resources and bring more funds and schemes from the centre, the chief minister has also decided to meet senior ias officials from west bengal now posted in delhi. at the meeting, slated for saturday, bhattacharjee will urge them to lobby with the centre in the interest of the state. industries minister nirupam sen and chief secretary manish gupta are also expected to attend the meeting. the meeting would be unofficial as the officers were not bound by law to work in the interest of the state, a senior official at the chief minister's secretariat said. ""you are from bengal. so help bengal,"" will be bhattacharya's informal message, he said. several ias officers from west bengal have gone to senior positions in the centre. some have even become secretaries, principal secretaries and joint secretaries and are in a position to ""influence"" the centre in giving more funds and developmental schemes to this state. ""the officers, being in senior positions, learn more about the new schemes and plans being mooted by different ministries in delhi. the chief minister will urge them to tip-off the state government so that the left mps can pursue with the centre and bring these schemes for this state,"" the senior state government official said. the idea, however, is not new and former chief minister jyoti basu had met senior bengali bureaucrats in delhi even earlier with a similar idea. ""somehow, the effort was not continued then. but this time, the chief minister seems determined to see results,"" a secretariat official said.

10,"Despite law, mentally ill suffer","new delhi: on paper, practically everything that is necessary is in place to ensure a dignified life for mentally challenged people. the central government changed an obsolete law, the indian lunacy act, 1912, almost 14 years ago, but several states have yet to start implementing the new mental health act. that act of 1987 has enough provisions to ensure that the mentally ill are not ill-treated and that their rights are not violated. an effective implementation of this act could have checked the tragic death in fire recently of 25 inmates of a privately-run mental asylum in ramanathapuram in tamil nadu. the act lays down strict norms for setting up a psychiatric hospital and empowers the police, civil society as well as judiciary to initiate action when rights of the mentally challenged are violated. some of the provisions are: * no person can start a psychiatric hospital without a licence. the licence would be valid for five years and renewal would depend on the licensing authority's satisfaction with the running of the hospital. * any private citizen can report to a magistrate if he believes that a mentally ill person is being ill-treated or neglected by relatives or other persons. the magistrate is empowered to initiate suo moto action if he comes to know of any ill-treatment of a mentally ill within his jurisdiction. * at least three visitors will make a joint inspection once a month of the hospital or nursing home. the hospital license can be revoked any time that the licensing authority feels that patients are not being looked after. * no mentally ill person is to be subjected to any indignity, whether physical or mental. and no person will be used for purposes of research unless such research is of direct benefit to him, either for diagnosis or treatment. * if a person feels he has recovered, he can apply to the maigstrate for discharge. the magistrate, after making inquiry, can order his discharge. * the act imposes penalty or imprisonment for those who violate the provisions. at the same time, the central government has established an authority for mental health for regulation, development and supervision of mental health services. under the act, all state governments need to establish such an authority for mental health. unfortunately, even in the global year of mental health, the provisions remain largely on paper.

11,Thousands rally against evictions,"kolkata: in the first show of strength against the west bengal government and calcutta municipal corporation's determination to go ahead with the eviction policies, more than 10,000 people marched over 10 kilometres from college square to gariahat on friday. the rally was organised by uchchhed birodhi jukta mancha, a forum of citizens' organisations from various walks of life. the procession resulted in a massive traffic snarl in central and southern parts of the city in the afternoon. the moving mass of people took up the whole of the south-bound road, letting only ambulances to pass. as it reached its destination, the busy gariahat junction was blocked for half-an-hour before the participants moved to a side and held a street-corner meeting. apart from hawkers, slum dwellers and residents along the tolly's nullah and other canals of the city, the participants also included the peasants of kulpi in south 24-parganas who are being evicted for building a port, the rickshaw pullers who are being threatened to be banished from the city and members of the mamc banchao committee from durgapur, who are being displaced from their factory. while they were not opposed to development, the members of the forum said, the official notion of development itself was skewed as it did not take the social cost of mass evictions into account. researchers have estimated that at least 300,000 people would be displaced from their homes and livelihood as a result of these policies. the economic contributions of these people cannot be wished away. moreover, eviction without a proper rehabilitation plan would create tremendous tensions in society. they alleged that such policies were directed by the world bank-adb-imf-wto regime. one the other hand, the measures violated the united nations declaration on the right to development adopted in 1986, which makes equality and justice preconditions for development. india is a signatory to this declaration.

13,"Govt keen on privatising farms, but dept demurs","bangalore: the government wants to privatise a few horticultural farms by handing them over to entrepreneurs on a 30-year lease. but the horticulture department, which is opposed to the idea has, however, suggested to the government to create a karnataka farm development corporation to ensure optimum utilisation and also mop up funds. official sources told the times of india the farms need to be managed professionally to tap the commercial potential as well as retain them for field demonstration and nurseries. ""the department is of the view it is unwise to lease out the lands as there is an element of risk involved. there is also a scope of litigation at the end of the three decade lease,"" they added. chief minister s.m. krishna had announced in his 2000-01 budget speech the government would seriously consider privatisation of some horticultural farms to make them viable. the state government is spending rs 13 crore for the maintenance of these farms, including salaries and earning a revenue of rs 9 crore. during 2000-01, the horticulture department earned a revenue of rs 10 crore. sources said the management of these farms was difficult due to a staff shortage. till 1984, things were fine as there was scope for recruiting workers on a contract basis. but it was stopped following a supreme court judgment in 1984. there are 415 farms throughout the state, accounting for an area of 17,153 acres. about 10,656 acres had been developed by planting fruit-bearing trees and nurseries. the first such farm was started in 1942 at maddur in an area of 42 acres for field demonstrations. in 1987, the horticulture department handed over 161 farms to zilla panchayats. the department's proposal lists out 17 of 415 farms which account for 3,500 acres to be privatised on an experimental basis. of these, five are meant exclusively for setting up food processing units.

15,HC for action against permit rule violators,"new delhi: the delhi high court on friday ruled that transport authorities should take stringent action against bus operators who violate permit rules and are found committing the same offence more than once. there were sufficient provisions in the permit rules evolved by the state transport authority to take action against violators and impose conditions on the continuance of permits, a division bench comprising justice arijit passayat and justice d k jain observed. they were hearing a public interest litigation on the violation of permit rules by transporters. ``there could be some leniency for the first time but stringent action should be taken if the offence is repeated,'' the bench said, while seeking details on the procedure being followed by authorities for second-time violators. in his pil, the petitioner, sugan chand aggarwal, has alleged that commuters are harassed while bus operators continue to violate rules with impunity.in its defence, the government counsel said if a bus was run without permit, a fine of rs 2000-rs 5,000 was imposed on the owner and, in many cases, the vehicles were impounded. the court observed that the challan was a deterrent, but the vehicle would have to be watched even after the driver was challaned. the bench gave the government till september 6 for filing a detailed reply. among the other things the petitioner mentioned were: * rules require conductors to display their identity card on their uniforms, which was not being followed, the pil said. though it was mandatory for drivers and conductors to wear uniforms, authorities have failed to enforce them strictly, the petitioner alleged. * sought a ban on playing music in buses and a directive to the bus staff to ensure that seats reserved for women and disabled persons were made available to them. * very few buses were displaying the fare and distance chart, despite clear guidelines in this regard. * private buses were allegedly employing drivers without licences and conductors who did not have the basic training of how to deal with passengers.

16,DPCC discusses civic polls,"new delhi: city chief minister sheila dikshit called a meeting of the delhi pradesh congress committee and mlas from east delhi recently to discuss the municipal elections next year. she plans to call another meeting of mlas and councillors from other areas to devise their election strategy. sources said the party had decided to oppose the rotation of seats as it reduced the credibility of councillors before their electorate. the leaders felt that the anti-incumbency factor will work in the congress' favour only if rotation is not resorted to. it was also decided in the meeting that the corporation would not be restructured before the elections as it would delay the polls, which would work to the bjp's advantage. in a related development, the congress leaders in the corporation have launched an offensive over the imposition of property tax on unauthorised colonies by the mcd. the congress, which is the opposition party in the mcd, has also decided to launch an attack on the bjp for being vague about the regularisation of sainik farms. leader of the opposition, ram babu sharma, said: ``the corporation should first provide sanitation and health services in unauthorised colonies, and then levy taxes. without providing services, the mcd should not collect tax. the bjp also keeps shifting its stand on sainik farms. it should put an end to the matter because a demolition at sainik farms will be a colossal waste of money and resources.''

17,Stay on arrests of ex-JMM MPs extended,"new delhi: the delhi high court on friday extended till november 1 the interim protection against arrest of three former jmm mps, against whom the cbi has registered cases of money disproportionate to their known income in 1993. justice k s gupta adjourned the hearing of bail pleas of suraj mandal, shibu soren and simon marandi after cbi counsel said their interim plea against arrest may be allowed. ``the records of appeals by former prime minister p v narasimha rao and former union minister buta singh, both convicted in the jmm bribery case, are not yet available so the investigation into the source of money has not progressed,'' cbi counsel told the court. cbi had registered cases against the jmm mps on november 16 last year following a special court's direction, when it convicted rao and his cabinet colleague buta singh under the prevention of corruption act. the special court had directed cbi to investigate the source of over rs 1.68 crore, deposited by the three jmm leaders in punjab national bank's nauroji nagar branch here. the cbi, during trial in the mps bribery case, had said the amount in question was the bribe money given to the three former mps for voting in favour of the rao government during the 1993 no-confidence motion. but the trial court in its judgment said the agency had failed to establish its source. the cbi in may sought the return of certain documents from the high court to pursue the probe about the source of money. the documents were submitted by the agency in court in response to appeals by rao and buta singh.

18,BJP fires first salvo for UP polls,"new delhi: uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh''s sacking of lcp leader and state energy minister naresh aggarwal on friday, after consulting party president jana krishnamurthy, is being viewed here as his bid to pre-empt the samajwadi party''s alleged bid to split the 19-member all-ministerial legislative wing of the loktantrik congress party, and reduce aggarwal''s bargaining power vis a vis the sp. bjp sources here said that this action had isolated aggarwal, who now had the backing of just two other lcp mlas and, therefore, the state government still had a majority. in place of the three lcp mlas it has lost, it now has the additional support of the nine mlas of ajit singh''s rashtriya lok dal. if the immediate provocation for sacking aggarwal was the bjp''s fear that the lcp was headed towards joining hands with the sp in the forthcoming assembly elections, the official reason being put out is that aggarwal was responsible for the abysmal power situation in the state, and that while up was reeling under a severe power crisis, he was in london for 20 days. given that power is likely to be a major election issue, the bjp is hoping aggarwal''s sack will blunt public anger against the rajnath singh ministry, especially as it is also being said that the minister had diverted electricity to his own constituency. of course, sources added that unless the bjp-led up government can do something about the power situation - which seems unlikely - dropping aggarwal may not help electorally. clearly, the move to drop aggarwal was planned as the bjp''s former president kushabhau thakre - who is in charge of up - has been camping in lucknow for the last few days. it is also part of the effort to reverse public perception that the up government is full of corrupt ministers. party sources said that since polls were due anyway, a few more ministers lacking in clean image might also be dropped. the bjp is secure in the knowledge that the opposition parties will be disinclined to replace the unpopular ministry on the poll eve. another reason being cited for aggarwal''s removal is his recent attempt to carve out a constituency for himself among the bania community through a series of rallies, including at delhi where even the prime minister spoke. but some bjp leaders pointed out that this caste game had a flip side, especially since the banias had always been regarded as the backbone of the bjp, giving not just their votes but money too. more crucially, though the banias constitute 4 per cent of the vote in the state, aggarwal had been attempting to forge a pan-trading castes formation of several obcs. moreover, if aggarwal''s sacking is played along with the way in which ram prakash gupta was replaced as chief minister by the bjp, it could become a potent weapon for the bjp''s political rivals.

25,Destruction of mangroves in Versova sparks protest,"mumbai: even as the government is in the process of setting up a committee to save mumbai's mangroves, a football field-sized section of versova's mangroves has been cleared and reclaimed over the past one week. the patch is part of the controversial survey no 161 opposite manjare charitable trust college building, which is under construction. ``when we protested, the contractors told us that the reclamation was being done to create a playground for the college,'' said usha kiran of the save andheri-versova environment (save) forum. the residents approached the police which merely registered it as a non-cognisable offence. the greens have now written a letter to municipal commissioner k.c. srivastava urging him to pay a visit to the site and assess the situation for himself. ``the police tell us to keep a watch on this plot, but we are helpless because powerful politicians are involved in this project,'' says ms kiran. it may be recalled that suburban collector c. sangitrao demolished a police chowkey at this site last month on the argument that it was private property and that local ngos could not put up any structure there. the greens of versova-lokhandwala got an inkling of the powerful interests behind the reclamation of mangroves when they were called for a meeting at mantralaya last month. their meeting with chief secretary v. ranganathan and the secretaries of the environment and urban develpment departments left them in no doubt that the government was in no mood to cancel the reclamation and development of the mangroves at versova. it was made clear to them that this mangrove tract (survey no 161) had been sold by the government to several developers and housing societies and that the political dispensation was not inclined to cancel the allotment. however, mr ranganathan told environment and energy secretary v.m. lal (who was present) that he could, as member of the coastal zone authority, monitor the developments in mumbai's coastal regulation zone and issue appropriate orders to stop any illegal reclamation. the chief secretary also told the greens that they could prepare a list of mangrove areas that they wished to protect and submit it to him. he said that the government would then appoint a team of officers from the revenue department, municipal corporation and the police to keep a vigil over these areas.

26,"Rajnath sacks LCP minister, but ministry appears safe","lucknow: uttar pradesh power minister naresh agarwal ought to have seen his dismissal coming. but he apparently did not. and when, during his loktantrik congress party (lcp) meeting in hardwar on thursday night, he raved and ranted against chief minister rajnath singh and up's bjp-led coalition government, it's end was clearly near. secure in the knowledge that the numbers in the up assembly would still add up for him, rajnath singh lost no time on friday morning in announcing the dismissal of agarwal. in a house of 403, the rajnath government is comfortably placed. against the requisite number of 202, it has the support of 210, even if the entire lcp is discounted. this becomes clear by the party position: 158 of the bjp, 13 of the lok janshakti, eight of the jantantrik bahujan samaj party, nine of the lok dal, four of the janata dal, two of the samata party, one of the samajwadi janata party, five unattached members, besides 10 independents. agarwal feebly attempted to suggest that he had put in his papers before the sack letter was sent to the governor. predictably, agarwal also announced that his lcp a major ally of the ruling coalition was pulling out. but it is an open secret that except for a couple, all the 19 lcp mlas (who, significantly, are members of the rajnath ministry) are not willing to walk out with agarwal. the rajnath ministry therefore is in no danger of falling apart. rajnath told reporters agarwal's hardwar outburst (over the state's power crisis, among other things) ``amounted to a violation of the principles of collective responsibility of the council of ministers.'' the cm went on: ``i gave him enough time to mend his ways and never once discredited him despite the worsening power situation in the state.'' rajnath said he would keep the power portfolio to himself and promised the situation would ``improve by next month''. significantly, up governor vishnu kant shastri was swift in declaring there was no immediate threat to the rajnath government. ``the question of rajnath having to seek a vote of confidence does not arise because no such demand has so far been made by any political party.'' admitting that he had received a letter from agarwal with regard to withdrawal of his party's support from the government, the governor hastily added that nine out of total 19 lcp members had called on him to say that they were not a party to that decision. they, instead, had imposed faith in the government, he said.
