0,Biotech council plans 'biotech incubator' at MSU,"vadodara: the state may have missed the it bus. but an ambitious project drawn up by ms university's bio-technology centre here to create an incubator for future technologies and ideas, which is being ""actively considered by gandhinagar"", may put gujarat ahead in a field that's developing very fast. the department has submitted a rs 7.5-crore plan for an incubator to the gujarat bio-technology council to help set up an incubator that will facilitate start-ups and a significant university-industry interface. ""generation of knowledge has always been the major motivation for universities, while industries have been influenced by the logic of the marketplace. this project will create a platform where innovative knowledge will lead to a process and then to a product which can be marketed. and, since bio-technology is a knowledge-intensive industry, this will ensure that the scene of production of technology will shift to places that generate knowledge,"" says head of the university's department of microbiology and bio-technology centre b b chattoo. ""the incubator will nurture innovations and take them to a point where they are ready for market evaluation. it will ensure that the intellectuals do not remain ensconced in their ivory towers and the industry realises the potential of knowledge workers,"" says chattoo. while the university has agreed ""in principle"" to provide a plot of land for the project, he is now scouting for funds from the state government, financial institutions and industries. the incubator will work on the principle of ""spotting young talent and providing them a free parking space for a fixed period wherein each would work on a project that can be used by industries."" the first step involves introduction of a one-year post-msc programme in genetic engineering and bio-technology development process where students will be oriented towards the needs of the industry. ""students who are bold enough to have their own start-ups will be identified. each individual will make a proposal, which will be studied by an expert panel comprising people from both technical and financial backgrounds to judge its viability,"" says chattoo. an agreement can then be worked out between the student and the university. ""this agreement may entail these students paying back a part of the money they might acquire once their project is successfully marketed. the university can use this money to develop and maintain the incubator,"" says chattoo. the second component of the incubator is a resource centre that would, on one hand, be a point to access all information on bio-technology and on the other act as a single window providing expertise on promotion and marketing of the projects being worked upon and also liaisoning with agencies for work like getting patents for the innovations. ""the resource centre would be mainly a facilitating unit providing logistical support. not only will it scout for a buyer for the new technologies developed at the incubator, it will also work on protection of intellectual property rights,"" informs chattoo. ""here, we are talking about a developing technology and working with just a spark of an idea. the university is not into business, but it can certainly use the intellectual property it is generating in a better fashion and to everyone's advantage. at a later stage, we can think of developing ms university as a brand. but, that will be after we have some successes,"" he adds. while the first step will involve spotting talent, it has to be followed by the brick-and-mortar part of establishing the incubator. chattoo feels that it will be able to sell technologies within four to five years. he also feels that such a system should also have a fairly high degree of autonomy without severing the umbilical cord with the mother university. ""the idea has worked at a lot of places. it has to take roots in india where the intellectuals are sort of cut off from the realities of the marketplace. a lot of projects of companies like hp, sun microsystems, biogen have originated from laboratories of universities. similar models have worked in the area around mit. there have been lots of start-ups in the boston area with about 30 in the field of bio-technology alone,"" says chattoo.

8,Jharkhand bandh evokes mixed response,"jamshedpur: the adivasi jan jagaran manch (ajjm) sponsored bandh against the babulal marandi government's reservation policy evoked mixed response in the twin districts of singhbhum east and west on saturday. the bandh had little impact in the steel city, where shops and business establishments functioned normally. the ajjm supporters forced shopkeepers to down their shutters in downtown bistupur on saturday afternoon, though. the bandh, however, was near total in the suburbs of parsudih, sundernagar and karandih. most of the shops and business established remained closed. about 250 ajjm workers also blocked the tata-chaibasa highway, paralysing vehicular traffic for over four hours. long distance buses, too, remained off the road. no untoward incident was reported from any part of the east singhbhum district, the police said though, there were stray incidents of bandh protoganists smashing windscreen of cars in steel city. the police had detained over 300 people till the afternoon. in the neighbouring west sinnghbhum district, official sources at the district headquarters at chaibasa said, the bandh evoked partial response. shops in certain localities remained closed and long distance vehicles were off the road. ranchi: saturday's bandh was called by the jharkhand adivasi janadhikar manch (jajm) and the adivasi chhatra sangh (acs) to press for 60 per cent reservation of seats for tribals exclusively. the jharkhand government has provided for 32 per cent reservation for tribals while the total reservation comes to 73 per cent, highest in the country. while the bandh in the state's capital passed off without any major incidents, a few thousand non-tribals (called biharis or dikus) - shouting ""bihar ekta zindabad"" and ""adivasi jharkhand chhoro"" - went round hinoo and doranda areas to oppose the bandh, and got the shops opened. the non-tribals, incensed by friday's rowdyism in which a small school-going child was badly injured by the jajm and acs supporters, proceeded towards the main road. but the deputy commissioner sukhdeo singh and the ssp niraj kumar persuaded them to end their procession at the overbridge around 10.30 am. in the city area purulia road, on which many missionary institutions are located, was the centre of action. the police was kept busy arresting the jajm and acs bandh supporters who arrived in buses at regular intervals. they were taken to jaipal singh stadium and birsa stadium respectively. the bjp-mp from orissa's mayrubhanj shalkhan murmu, spearheading the agitation, was taken into custody with a dozen supporters around 12.30 pm on purulia road. in other parts of the city, like serumtoli and arogora the bandh supporters tried to burn two vehicles, but could not succeed. however, in loadih, according to reports two scooter-borne muslim youths were badly injured by sword-wielding bandh supporters. and when three others tried to rescue them, they were also beaten up. also, near hinoo post office motorcyle-borne bandh supporters were beaten up. the sporadic clashes between the two groups kept the police busy right through the day. many roads were splattered with glass pieces as windshields of vehicles were smashed by the bandh supporters. hazaribagh: the jharkhand bandh call given by the adivasi chatra adhikar manch headed by its president and janadhikar manch leader salkhan murmu mp in protest against the 32 per cent reservation for scheduled tribes of jharkhand in government services announced by the jharkhand government, failed to evoke any response in hazaribagh district and all the government offices, commercial organisations and vehicular traffic as well as rail traffic functioned smoothly, said deepak verma sp. he said that even in gola and ramgarh which has a sizeable tribal population, the bandh failed and no untoward incident was reported. however, agitating congressmen took out a procession in protest against the reservation policy and burnt an effigy of the cm.

9,HC pulls up Jharkhand minister,"ranchi: the jharkhand high court judgment setting aside the appointments of jharkhand state electricity board chairman rajib ranjan and member s n akhouri may have far-reaching implications for appointments to various state power boards and state-run public utilities in the country. the 30-page judgment comments widely on the selection procedure for statutory boards - adhering to articles 14 and 16 of the constitution - and comes down heavily on state energy minister lalchand mahto, who was in such an ""awful hurry"" that he kept on ignoring the rules of executive business and also the statutory selection procedures. even as jseb was proposed to be constituted in february this year, mahto had sent a list of names - not ranjan and akhouri - for the said posts directly to the chief minister, bypassing the department's secretary and chief secretary, which was violative of article 32 of the rules of executive business. the court has observed that in a democracy no one, howsoever high he may be, can be permitted to subvert the mandatory constitutional provisions. later, while recommending the names of ranjan and akhouri the minister, however, took recourse to the prescribed rules to which the court has remarked it appears the minister had ultimately realised his mistake. but here he committed another mistake. even as the court had directed the government to place before it any file regarding consultation of the minister with the chief minister on the appointments no such file existed; there was no record of any consultation. not only this. the division bench comprising chief justice v k gupta and justice m y eqbal, hearing the public interest litigation (pil)-cwjc 924 of 2001 filed by arbind kumar roy, also found that no procedure was followed in locating, proposing, recommending or selecting these names and that the minister had indulged in a patently arbitrary exercise of executive power. the government should have complied with particular eligibility criteria, specific knowledge and experience of a particular type as laid down in section 5 of the electricity supply act 1948, the judgment said. sub-section 4 of the act mentions that the members should (a) have experience in commercial matters and administration, or (b) be an electrical engineer or (c) have experience of accounting and finance in a public utility company preferably electricity supply undertaking. the court while interpreting electric supply undertaking has said that an undertaking which supplies electricity alone should be considered as electric supply undertaking and not one which may directly or indirectly, remotely or proximately be connected with any matter related to electricity as such. ranjan, whose appointment has been declared illegal by the court, has been with the power sector for the past 27 years and was an executive director in the power finance corporation, a central government undertaking, before being made jseb chairman. he falls short of the jharkhand high court's expectation of having electricity supply undertaking experience. (however, a former executive director of the national thermal power corporation (ntpc) is the chairman of the punjab state electricity board and a former executive director of the power grid corporation heads the uttaranchal power board. mahto got himself appointed chairman of the tenughat vidyut nigam ltd, while former incumbents of the posts in the bihar state electricity boards (bseb) were appointed essentially for their technical or administrative expertise and no wider aspect of selection was followed.) the court has taken exception to the fact that neither any vigilance clearance nor acr (10 years) was obtained from the past employers of ranjan and akhouri before the appointments despite the chief secretary's advice. recommendations were made by the minister and okayed by the cm without there being any material on record. the appointments were made without following the procedure as laid down in articles 16 or 14 of the constitution relating to equality before law and equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. is it not a case of favouritism and nepotism? the court asked.

14,Rectify archaic labour laws: Fernandes,"lucknow: former defence minister george fernandes on sunday said that the proposed amendments in the industrial dispute act would spell trouble for the working class. some of the amendments, if carried in its original shape, would empower industrial houses to terminate workmen even without a notice, he added. criticising the overall attitude of industrial houses fernandes, who was in the city to attend the biennial national conference of the hind mazdoor kisan panchayat, said it was unfortunate that some of the industrial houses hired the services of muscle men to tackle their own men. fernandes said that archaic labour laws should be rectified. he said if old and outdated industrial laws were suitably amended, most of the industrial disputes which often resulted in cessation of work would disappear. fernandes felt that all the nations concerned with the lot of workers should participate at the wto conference to be held in doha and strongly plead for the enactment of laws in the favour of the developing world. he said the issues that remained unsorted at the seattle meeting of the wto should not cause any obstacle in the formation of new laws for the workers. he said in this age of depression only two countries were able to fight it effectively and they were india and china. the industrial growth rate in india was 5.6 per cent which was no mean achievement. he said many developed countries like japan had negative growth rate. fernandes felt that all nations should support the war against terrorism so that it was banished from the soil once and for all. he said it would be in the fitness of things if the us supported indians in fighting terrorism in jammu and kashmir. earlier, the kisan panchayat passed more than two dozen resolutions to improve the industrial scenario in the country.

18,'District minister should quit over riots',"hubli: the yuva morcha of bharatiya janata party has demanded the resignation of district minister a.m. hindasgeri, accusing him of being responsible for the violence which started from september 15. the members said karnataka chief minister s.m. krishna should immediately drop him from the cabinet and give a more eligible person the post. the general secretary of the party, sunil baddi said, the failure of the local police in protecting the property and lives of innocent persons was one of the main reasons for violence and miscreants had stoned the procession of the bajrang dal near maratha galli. baddi said the bajrang dal and vhp activists had intimated the authorities about the procession route in their permission application and the shobha yatra committee had urged the department to make adequate security arrangements. the bjp condemned the statements by karnataka hoem minister mallikarjuna kharge that a single community was being selectively targetted by the miscreants. he said there was a conspiracy hatched much earlier to disturb the procession and stop the 75th birth anniversary celebrations of vhp chief, ashok singhal. the morcha also welcomed the move of the state government in ordering a judicial enquiry to probe the incidents. blaming the whole unfortunate episode on the police department, they said, it was the duty of the department to take adequate precautionary measures to prevent such disturbances. in a another press release issued by the state convenor of bajrang dal, pramod mutalik, he said, it was very unfortunate that such incidents had taken place on the occasion of the amruthmahotsava of ashok singhal. he said, the charges against the bajrang dal were ``baseless'' and the state government was ``unnecessarily'' blaming the dal. he said while everybody had accused the vishwa hindu parishad and bajrang dal for the serial bomb blasts in various churches of karnataka and goa, it was found that it was the handiwork of terrorists operating out of pakistan with their accomplices in karnataka. he said the public should not forget the involvement of the deenadar anjuman siddique organisation in the bomb blasts.

20,Drive to sensitise girls against violence,"mumbai: this fairy-tale story of a poor flower girl who was `asked out' by a rich stranger didn't impress many of these young girls. after all, this was not a story where the `they lived happily ever after'. ``what if he did `things' to her,'' was a concern a 13-year-old voiced. others pointed out that the stranger could ``betray her'', ``use her'' and ``not marry her''. indeed, on the eve of girl child day, being observed on september 24, these young girls proved they cannot be taken for granted. they voiced their opinions at the `convention of girl children on violence against the girl child', at cardinal gracious school at bandra (e), on sunday. the convention was organised by the coordination committee for vulnerable children (ccvc), under the auspices of unicef, in association with other ngos like saathi, akshara and yuva. around 200 girls, who participated in the convention are associated with different ngos from all over mumbai and were made to analyse and comment on real life situations. if you are eve-teased on your way to school, will you stop attending school? if your employer physically or sexually abuses you, would you still work for him? can your brother or father too abuse you? should the girl be held responsible if she is raped? these were a few of the topics that were discussed at the meeting. the girls were divided into different groups and each group discussed a case study and the participants were asked to give solutions. so, solutions for eve-teasing ranged from ``ignore it and sit at home'', which was unanimously condemned, to ``you can't leave school and sit at home because someone said something to you'', as a spirited reshma said. in another group, young girls racked their brains for a solution for a homeless girl who did not want to go back to her employer's place. and most suggestions from these young minds were bold enough. one group, for instance, strongly felt that a girl who worked during the day and attended night school, should not work ``she should study and her parents can work,'' was their solution to the problem. some girls, however, felt that being bold was not really a good idea. when a volunteer questioned that if a girl was eve-teased on the road was she responsible for it, one replied, ``of course. she is not a good girl''. her description of a good girl was one who wears a `dupatta' with her dress and does not speak to men. ``it took some time to convince her that wearing a `dupatta' does not make a difference to the character of a person and that it is a matter of choice,'' said babli rawat from the experimental theatre foundation. the convention, aptly called: titliyan apne astitva ki talash mein (butterflies in search of their identities) aimed at sensitising young girls, aged 12 to 18, on different forms of abuse. ``we are creating awareness among these young girls to help them understand what abuse is and that it is wrong,'' a volunteer pointed out. ``and gender-related violence is not new,'' said saji thomas, coordinator ccvc. he added that the problem existed in the past and continues to persist. ``girl children are denied of their rights on two counts, one because they are children and second because they are girls. this dual oppression warrants that the issues of girl children be looked at differently and addressed differently,'' he said.

21,Bellary DC accused of succumbing to political pressure,"bellary: bjp district unit president g. karunakar reddy said deputy commissioner jawaid akhtar had ``succumbed to political pressure'' as he had ``totally failed to remove pigs from the town even after several appeals'' made quests by bjp members. speaking to reporters at the government guest house here on sunday, reddy said, the deputy commisioner had not made any effort to remove a single pig out of the town, even after brain fever raised its head in the district. ``it is the responsibility of the district administration to take all precautionary measures to check spread of brain fever in the district and remove pigs from the town, which are the main cause for the disease,'' reddy said. ``inaction of the deputy commissioner in this regard is a clear indication that he is working under political pressure, as most of the local pig-breeders are supporters of local congress leaders,'' he alleged. further hitting out at the deputy commissioner, reddy said, akhtar had never visited the places where people were in serious trouble because of flooding in their colonies. reddy said, several requests made to the dc by him and the vice-president of city municipal council had fallen on deaf ears. due to heavy rain in the district, most of the colonies have been flooded and the rain water was stagnating. shetty said, its not only the deputy commisoner but also the revenue officials, who have failed to perform or even lend an ear to the problems of the people. reddy demanded an action plan by the district administration to solve the interim problems regarding the crossing of small culverts and bridges. he said, during heavy rain, small bridges get flooded and accidents of drowning and getting washed away by the flood water have become a common feature in the district. he said, recently five persons were washed away at the kuruvatti culvert after a bus overturned mid-stream. reddy lashed out at kolur basavana gowda, local mp, for forgetting the promise he had made to people of the town, after he was elected to parliament. reddy said, gowda had assured immediate work on bisilahalli bridge located on the outskirts of the town, which is a key-point for vehicle movement from the local mp fund, but ``he has conveniently forgotten his promise.'' reddy said, 21 of such bridges in the district have been identified and the district administration shoould come out with a master plan to develop these culverts and bridges. he further said, the municipal council has sent proposals to the central government for sanction of rs 20 crore under national slum development scheme and rs 30 crore under integrated development of small and medium town scheme. ``but the state government should demand speedy action by the central government,'' said reddy. g. somasekhar reddy, vice-president, municipal council, who was also present along with karunakar reddy said, with heavy rain lashing the town for the past few days, over 80 houses and huts in slum areas have either collapsed or partially damaged. ``but this year, the major problem being faced by the people here is of flushing out rain water that has entered the colonies. ``as most of the surface drains are clogged, the rain water has entered the residential colonies, he said. somasekhar reddy said compensation of rs 500 for house collapse and rs 300 for partial damage would be provided as an interim relief.
