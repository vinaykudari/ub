""last-minute campaigning dosen't make any difference. people have long decided who they want to vote for but the candidates are only doing their job,"" said ranjita daud and shaily mishra, both m phil students. in the end, around 62.18 per cent of the 4,400 students cast their votes for the four jnusu posts, 25 posts of councillors from different schools and two student representatives on the gender sensitisation committee against sexual harassment. an expected decline over last year's 70 per cent polling, since ""a number of students have proceeded on leave because of diwali,"" admitted election committee chairperson ali raza moosvi, a phd student. the polling was largely peaceful. the election co-ordinator of the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad was disenfranchised for bringing out a pamphlet on sunday, a no-campaign day. this led to minor tension between supporters, election officials said. the results will be announced after noon on tuesday, moosvi said. although polling started at 9.30 am, the atmosphere warmed up only by mid-morning, picking tempo later in the day.

1,Joint protest against POTO,"lucknow: all india muslim forum (almf) and cpi-ml staged a joint `protest dharna' in front of the vidhan bhawan here on monday against the recently promulgated prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto). adressing a gathering, the general secretary of the forum prof mk sherwani said that perhaps nver in a democratic country the principles of natural justice and individual liberty had been trampled down by any legislative measure in such a ruthless manner as had ben done through this most draconian ordinance. ""the most obnoxious of all the provisions which may be used to repress even the mediapersons is the one that empowers the investigators to extract such information from anyone they suspect of having"", he stressed. with such a law on a statute book, we forfeit our claim to be called a democratic polity, he added. syed afzal, vice-president of the forum expressed apprehension that like its predecessor tada, this new measure would also be used to harrass the muslim community in the name of terrorism on the eve of state assembly elections. the forum's state president salahuddin khan said that there was no division of opinion in te country about the resolve to combat the scourge of terrorism, but poto was only a smokescreen through which the bjp led governments wanted to implement their fascist agenda by persecuting the minorities and throttling the voice of opposition. the cpi-ml leaders addressing the dharna alleged that the bjp was taking the help of a black law like like poto to carry out its communal and fascist policies in the country. they said that this ordinance instead of containing terrorism would deprive the people to raise their voice against their rights.

2,Bandra fire victims accuse govt of apathy,"mumbai: for the residents of dnyaneshwar nagar, bandra (east), one day after a major fire broke out claiming seven lives and rendering over 3,000 people homeless, the trauma is not yet over. complaining of government apathy, the residents of the area said here on monday that the government had not yet carried out any relief work in the area. ``thanks to the people from bharatnagar, the neighbouring area that we got our meal last night,'' said junaid master, a tailor whose house was gutted in the fire. a mat and a few broken vessels were the only few things his family was able to salvage. another resident, mohammed aziz, said that he was unable to recognise his house when he rushed from work on hearing about the fire. the area which was once a sprawling slum pocket in bandra east is now covered with debris, with not a single house in tact. the residents are left with nothing except for the clothes they were wearing on the day of the fire. fortunately, a few social groups, have volunteered their service in their area. hundreds of children with broken cups and saucers and hopeful eyes rushed to a van as volunteers of father agnel ashram served tea. another queue formed near a stall of dharavi social work committee which is distributing clothes to residents. ``several ministers visited us in these two days, said ladoo singh, who had a grocery store which is now reduced to ash. however, he added the ministers just came with their camera crew and left without words of any consolation or help. even the compensation of rs 600 announced by chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on sunday failed to lift their spirits. `` every household has lost television sets, sewing machines, utensils, clothes, stove and stored ration which were worth thousands of rupees,'' said an angry resident. anthony samy, secretary to lokshahi hakk sanghatana said as their survey continued it revealed that people lost even basic items of their livelihood. `` officials are now saying that the people had illegal electric connection but the residents were paying bills which may have now been burnt. the amount of rs 600 announced by mr deshmukh is a pittance compared to the losses. the immediate requirement of the people is food ration, utensils, bamboos and mats to rebuild their houses. basic items like kerosene and stove are needed to start their lives. to make matters worse some of the belongings which were not burnt were stolen on sunday night, said residents. the most heart-rending sight was young children clinging on to broken pieces of biscuits and bread as other residents tried to recover the remnants of their belongings. as the sun set, it was the second dark night they were getting ready to face as they said that for sometime they would have to learn to live with darkness.

3,From the wrong arm of the law to officers with a rose,"mumbai: one of the most enduring and uneasy relationships dance bars in the city have had is with the police. the classic love-hate manifests itself in a series of trysts __ from the filmy stereotype of shadowing underworld dons at their carnal carnivals to enforcing nightly deadlines and moral codes to chilling out to running the bars by proxy. not only policemen, but politicians who rant against the ``immorality and decadence'' at these joints in their public appearances, renew the licences of these bars every year and own stakes. while politicians like kripashankar singh, ramdas kadam and anil deshmukh are known to storm beehives, a former chief minister owns beer bars and bjp corporator gopal shetty had dared civic demolition squads to touch these joints a couple of years ago. what makes it easy for policemen to enter the dance bar business is their familiarity with the functioning of these joints and the nature of partnerships to set one up, says a senior police officer, who runs a dance bar in the eastern suburbs in partnership. ``as many as five to ten people get together, pulling in about rs 2 lakhs each for a 10-20 per cent stake. most policemen can afford that investment,'' he says. however, he says even his joint does not enjoy immunity from other policemen. ``they know i can't complain about their bribe demands, while they can report me to higher ups,'' he says, requesting anonymity. he says that on an average, each police station illegally collects rs 1 lakh per month per bar from more than 2,000 dance bars in the state by exploiting the 1.30 a.m. closure deadline. the state exchequer can earn rs 200 crore a year just by extending the deadline to 4.30 a.m. and charging a fee in return, he says. ``the excuse that law and order problems arise out of late-night functioning of these bars do not hold if one compares the number of offences that have been reported in bars in the last five years as opposed to offences that occurred at general business premises in broad daylight in that period. all five stars hotels and pubs serve drinks throughout the night, so why should the government discriminate?'' says the police officer, who plans to quit the force and concentrate on his business. while love triangles stemming out of jealousy and rivalry between customers over a particular girl result in occasional skirmishes and murders, those in the bar business shrug it off as just a ``professional risk'' and blame the media for glamorising such crime and inviting undue attention. an inspector from one of the crime branch `encounter' squads even rubbishes the underworld hotspot myth that scourge the dance bars. ``the top criminals have become too sophisticated and alert to indulge in such crass and high-risk entertainment. most of them know they can be sitting ducks for the police if they visit these places,'' he says. the women, their union representatives and even many policemen privately acknowledge that the uniformed keepers of law often become its most brazen abusers when dealing with a nightly pastime unique to mumbai among indian metros. according to anand shetty, president of the maharashtra hotel and restaurant ladies employees union, ``the police, in the absence of any real legal handle to harass these women with, often slap section 110 and 117 of the bombay police act which involves public indecency and nuisance like spitting.'' lawyer vibhav krishna says public indecency in terms of ``contemporary community standards'' has no fixed meaning and is vague. the courts have limited it to public display of nakedness and production, sale and exhibition of pornographic material, he says. ``who determines contemporary community standards? the police? some cops exploit the fact that the accused has to go around and prove that what he did was not indecent,'' he adds. instances of more serious police harassment include stopping rickshaws carrying bar girls near malvani, malad, at night and taking them to an adjacent deserted burning ground to frighten them and extract bribes, he says. ``moreover, just for parking their vehicles, the girls pay rs 4,500-5,000 every month as bribe at one place. first, the beat officers will come, then the duty constables, the assistant sub-inspectors and others,'' he says. the union leader says the attitude of the police is appalling and derogatory. ``they come and say, ` chal mere saath. saab bulaya hain. bola ladki leke aaneko.' (come with me. my boss has asked me to get a girl for him tonight),'' he says. also, bribes to policemen account for the largest part of overheads, which is making it difficult for owners to run the business during recession. ``steep license fees have hit us hard. just the overheads of running such a joint come to rs 20,000 a day, of which at least rs 5,000-6,000 account for hafta to the police__right from assistant commissioners to hawaldars. add to it excise, cost of liquor, rent and other costs,'' says a saki naka-based hotelier. sometimes the police, just to show themselves above board, come and raid and levy massive fines. at the end of the month, the owner is sometimes left with only three or four days' profits. from the customers' point of view, there is hardly any tool apart from blackmail for the police to take them into custody. at most, a case for indecent behaviour or drinking without permit can be slapped, both of which carry nominal fines. however, depending on how expensive a reputation is at stake, the blackmail amount goes rs 100 upward. certain top corporate executives have even paid rs 1 lakh to get out of the mess, says the officer-cum-bar owner. thus, on the parallel track of truth and lies, fed by embers of male fantasy, the business of dance bars chugs along. more and more stories board it at every station, more lives become a part of the journey. (this is the concluding part in a three-part series on dance bars in mumbai.)

4,Dalit misery mounts after govt campaign,"kurnool: the dalits of belum village in kolimigundla mandal had to face social boycott from the upper castes, thanks to the three-day anti-untouchability campaign launched by the state government. the upper castes of the village issued a directive to the villagers that no one should talk to any dalit or help them as they had entered the local temples, sivalayam and ramalayam, during the anti-untouchability campaign with the help of officials. as many as 400 dalits, including some backward castes from belum,had come to kurnool and camped at the collectorate complex on monday. shouraiah, a dalit from belum, said that no member of the higher castes were cooperating with the dalits. milk vendors were not supplying milk, shop owners had stopped selling any commodities to the dalit families, even the village barber refuses to shave, he said. daveedu, another dalit, alleged that though they filed a complaint at the kolimigundla police station, the police did not take any action against the upper castes. meanwhile, the sp p s r anjaneyulu told the times of india that the kolimigundla police registered a case against 6 upper castes, who threatened the dalits. he said that he spoke to the dalits and assured them about their safety.

6,Squabble over party tickets led to rift,"chandigarh: differences over allotment of party tickets for the forthcoming vidhan sabha elections is believed to have caused the sudden face-off between pcc president amarinder singh and senior vice-president jagmeet brar, after having remained seemingly cordial for about two months. according to party sources, brar had demanded that candidates of his choice be nominated to at atleast 19 vidhan sabha seats, which amarinder had turned down. he, reportedly, also declined to commit the muktsar party ticket to brar's brother. his attempt to get tickets for his supporters in certain areas of faridkot and adjoining places is deemed to be a covert attempt to consolidate his hold in the region. brar has staked the claim on the grounds of having defeated chief minister prakash singh badal's son, sukhbir, in the last lok sabha election. it was after the pcc president put his foot down on the matter that brar, who had remained quiet for some time, fired salvos against amarinder and sought to rake up the issue of tickets being allotted to the kith and kin of senior congress leaders. brar, however, denied he had ever made such a demand on the pcc chief and clarified that he wanted a definite yardstick to be evolved before party nominees for all the seats were decided. he said he was strongly against relatives of senior leaders being given tickets. his other criterion being that those who had links with militants or had a tainted past be barred from being party candidates. though the party high command has yet to evolve a formula for selecting candidates,amarinder told times news network, on monday, that there could not be hard and fast rules for it. he said the popularity of a candidate would be the sole criterion, whether he belonged to the family of a known congress leader or not. however, he was quick to add that whatever the differences on the count the party leaders had no business of going to the media to air their views. he said aicc treasurer moti lal vohra, who is also the state observer, had given categorical instructions to the party leaders on this score. after suspending a key supporter of brar, amarinder sounded firm on keeping discipline in the party. he said he would not brook indiscipline of any form and would come down heavily on those indugling in anti-party activities. he said if brar had any grudges he should have shared them with party president sonia gandhi or vohra, who is the aicc incharge. he indicated that he intended to come down heavily on dissidents if they planned to queer his pitch.

7,Mamata election a circus: Panja,"kolkata: mamata banerjee's election as the chairperson of the all india trinamul congress committee has been described as farce by suspended trinamul leader ajit kumar panja.

""on behalf of the party, we want a dialogue on the issue between indian and bangladeshi governments,"" mukherjee said in kolkata on monday. speaking to reporters after a congress legislature party meeting on monday, mukherjee said that the us position vis-a-vis terrorism in south asia must be also be made clear. ""usa has prioritised afghanistan and kashmir. but it has to clarify whether kashmir is witnessing struggle for self-determination or terrorism. without such a clarification, india's concern for terrorism cannot be adequately reflected,"" mukherjee said. the clp meeting was convened to brief 26 congress mlas in the west bengal assembly about international developments and to get a feedback from the mlas' respective constituencies about this. based on the feedback, the cwc will finalise its position on the matter and will also face the government in parliament. among other issues that featured at the clp discussion was the question of central and state draft ordinances on counter-terrorism measures.

11,Stop palmolein oil import: Saurashtra farmers,"rajkot: farmers of saurashtra region have urged the state government to stop the import of palmolein oil so as to give better and remunerative prices to their groundnut produce. about 25 per cent of their produce are yet to hit the already-flooded marketing yards. sources in the groundnut industry told tnn on tuesday that despite the purchase of groundnut by co-operatives the state government should stop the import of palmolein oil to give the necessary push to groundnut prices. the saurashtra oil millers association (soma) has asked the state government to lift the curb on groundnut oil stock or to hike its limit. it said this will enable a trader or an oil-miller to keep a much larger stock and ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. association president ukabhai patel felt the best way to give remunerative prices to the farmers is to stop the import of palmolein oil for the next four months as during this period they usually dispose off their stock. the president of rajkot district kharid vechan sangh, lalji savalia, said though the farmers are not getting good prices for their produce now, they should wait for the government to offer remunerative prices. haribhai patel, president of the oilseeds bullion merchants association, said the state government rule that allows oil-millers and traders to stock 30 tonnes of groundnut oil should be increased to 75 tonnes. this, he felt, would help the farmers to get a remunerative price for his produce. a large number of oil-millers are interested in stocking more groundnut oil and have also agreed to pay higher prices to farmers, provided the state government lifts the curb.

16,Spurt in roadside tiling linked to civic polls,"new delhi: despite numerous initiatives against the ''beautification'' of roads, the menace continues. even now, half the city is in the throes of tiling, de-tiling, changing kerbstones and making pavements. and all the civic agencies â€” the pwd, the mcd and the dda â€” are actively involved. the spurt in tiling may be related to the forthcoming mcd elections. ''the councillors are working hard. a lot of development work is going on. work on parks, drains, roads and pavements is being done in right earnest,'' mcd standing committee chairman prithviraj sawhney said. ''a big job like dense carpeting on a main road will not bring as much kudos to a councillor as the tiling of backlanes and pavements. it is small projects like these which influence corporation elections.'' the figures seem to bear out the link between elections and roadwork. the corporation was given rs 27.5 crore in 2000-2001 for maintaining roads. of this, the city government claims, the mcd spent only rs 9 crore. for 2001-02, the delhi government has allocated rs 128 crore. this is besides the rs 100 crore allotted to the mcd by the union urban development ministry. mcd additional commissioner (engineering), vishnu swarup sharma said: ''we change tiles only where the road is newly constructed and where lots of tiles are broken. in fact, lt-governor vijai kapoor has issued instructions that there should be no unnecessary tiling.'' sharma said mcd projects had many components: roads, drains, pavements, central verges, lighting and footpaths. ''funds for the entire project never come in one go. money might be allotted only for roads or for pavements or lighting. so a project is undertaken piecemeal and might take up to five years to complete. we may take up roads but complete the drains later. pavements may be done two years after the project was cleared. but the common man feels we are working at the same spot and doing the same job for years,'' sharma said. leader of the opposition in the mcd house, atma ram gupta, said: ''one reason for tiling is that the water table is going down drastically. the civic agencies are primarily replacing older tiles with interlocking ones that let water percolate into the soil.''

17,BJP to launch nationwide campaign for terror law,"new delhi: the bjp is finalising three booklets for mass distribution to mobilise public opinion in favour of the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto). these booklets are being readied for its countrywide campaign, which will be launched on november 18, a day before the beginning of the winter session of parliament. union law minister arun jaitley and disinvestment minister arun shourie are clearly the two leaders who will be at the forefront of the campaign â€” not only have they been fielded repeatedly on tv by the party, but now even articles written by them will be reproduced in these publicity booklets. for the launch of the campaign, union ministers will visit state capitals as they are ''in a better position'' to answer queries and explain why poto is needed, party sources said. besides, most of the bjp's articulate spokespersons are now in the government, and involving ministers will give the campaign a higher profile. bjp workers are being asked to carry the campaign forward right down to the smallest units of the party. bjp president jana krishnamurthy said that the first booklet would carry an article on poto by jaitley and a few others from delhi dailies, and the second would contain three pieces by shourie. the third will be in question and answer form, taking on the opposition's attack on the ordinance. they will also be translated into a few regional languages. for the bjp, the purpose of the campaign is twofold: one, it aims at pressuring opposition parties to support the poto bill when it comes up for voting in the winter session â€” this is particularly important in the rajya sabha where the nda is in a minority. two, the party's pro-poto campaign will set the stage for its campaign for the assembly elections in uttar pradesh, uttaranchal, punjab and manipur scheduled for next february.
