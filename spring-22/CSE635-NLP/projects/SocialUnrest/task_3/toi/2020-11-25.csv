0,1984 riots: CBI wants Sajjan's case reopened,"NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday told the High Court that a lower court had wrongly acquitted Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.

Kumar and nine others were accused of leading a mob that killed and looted Sikhs in outer Delhi after the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Additional solicitor general K K Sud appeared on behalf of the CBI and said: â€˜â€˜The trial court has erred in acquitting the accused as it did not consider the statements of prosecution witnesses before various inquiry commissions.â€™â€™

The hearing started before the Bench of Justice Vijender Jain and Justice -M A Khan. Sud said the trial court was wrong in rejecting statements of witnesses who appeared before the Thakkar commission that probed Indira Gandhiâ€™s assassination.

The court agreed to hear the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and eight other appellants in view of the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in the Best Bakery case.

The CBI had registered the case against Sajjan Kumar on a complaint by Anwar Kaur who lost her husband in the riots. She, however, contradicted her own statements during the trial.

1,Cong has edge over JD(S) in Council election,"CHIKMAGALUR: The Congress has a slight edge over its bete noire Janata Dal (Secular) in the forthcoming elections to the Legislative Council from this Malnad district of Chikmagalur where political temperature is slowly building up.

In a straight fight, the Congressâ€™ D.M. Puttegowda, a former MP, will take on former Zilla Panchayat chairman S. Thipperudrappa of the Janata Dal (Secular) in the December 1 biennial hustings.

The scales are evenly poised, and they might tilt in the Congress favour. When â€˜The Times of Indiaâ€™ toured the dusty innards of the plains whose political dalliance is still a secret and may remain so with no overtones till ballots are counted, it found out that the Congress faced a bit of rough weather. This minor hitch could be overcome in the Malnad where the Congress is galloping to the finishing line.

Both the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) claim a support base, complete with statistics, in various assembly constituencies which is disputed by veterans of the electoral battle, who said itâ€™s money â€” and certainly not caste or party affiliations â€” that holds the key to the results.

In the previous elections, they said, both candidates spent at least a few lakhs of rupees to secure votes. â€œThe situation is no different now,â€™â€™ a leader said.

The Congress leaders hinted at issuing a whip to the party members in Zilla Panchayat, Taluk Panchayat and municipalities but a large chunk of votes are held by village panchayat members, who are elected apolitically. Election rules stipulate that the village panchayat members shall not have any political affiliations.

An observer said election of village panchayat members is apolitical but that does not rule out their political affiliations; each member has some leanings individually, which impact the results.

The Congress claimed more than 1,000 village panchayat members of the total 2,173 owe their allegiance to it, and this could be a swing factor.

Interestingly, the Janata Dal (Secular), too, is banking on a similar calculation. Besides it has its presence in the plains.

The candidature of Puttegowda is boosted by the fact that the district has contributed three ministers, a Congress party MLA and the partyâ€™s complete control over the Zilla Panchayat.

The electoral college comprises 2,494 voters, of which 30 are from the Zilla Panchayat, 106 from Taluk Panchayat, 174 from the city municipality and other civic agencies and 2,173 from village panchayats.

2,Principal files complaint against student,"LUDHIANA: Following unruly incidents, the principal of local Arya College on Wednesday lodged a complaint against a student and some outsiders, charging them for disrupting the college functioning.

The complaint was lodged at police station division number 8 with the request to take appropriate action against the student and his accomplices.

The college authorities have requested the police to keep watch when the college reopens on November 29 after holidays.

According to the principal, SM Sharma, BA II student Satwant Singh and his accomplices instigated the students to damage the furniture and window panes of the library.

The students said that they observed strike on the issue of higher fee being charged from them. They maintained their protest was peaceful. But the principal contested their claims saying they indulged in indiscipline.

The teaching work was suspended after 11.30 am when about 300 hundred students went around the college campus raising slogans.

Sharma expressed ignorance about the exact cause of provocation for the students claiming that he had deputed some teachers to know about the reason, but no student came forward to tell him about their grievance.

3,Basmati-growers unhappy with contract-farming,"RAMPURA PHUL, Bathinda: The Punjab government''s ambitious contract farming programme seems to have added to the misery of hundreds of farmers here who are on the path of an agitation for the last three days to mount pressure on Punjab Agro, Graintech and Escorts to procure their Basmati.

The farmers are ruing the day they entered into a contract with government agencies for Basmati cultivation under the diversification promotion scheme of the state government.

For the last many days the farmers here are running after officials of Graintech and Punjab Agro to procure their produce. The farmers are sitting guard on heaps of their crop in mandis here but the government agencies are procuring the Basmati.

While the agencies officials are adamant on making the purchase after grading the produce, the farmers are demanding a flat rate for their produce.

Annoyed with the attitude of the agencies, on Sunday the farmers here detained two officials of Punjab Agro to register their anger.

The officials were released late in the evening after the sub divisional magistrate and tehsildar Phul interfered and assured procurement at flat rate.

On Monday about 100 farmers blocked vehicular traffic on Phul-Salabatpura road for about one hour to register their protest against the attitude of the procurement agencies.

On Tuesday, though the Punjab Agro made some purchase of Basmati but the farmers organised a rally in front of the market committee office here, alleging that the agencies were not paying the rate agreed between the Punjab Agro and farmers.

Buta Singh Burjgill, Bathinda district president of BKU (Sidhupur group), who is leading the protest said that while the Basmati was reaching the mandi in bulk, the procurement was very slow and tardy.

The farmers of this area sowed HBC-19 and Basmati-386 varieties. Buta Singh said that Punjab Agro and Graintech had made an agreement of purchasing the produce of these two varieties at the rate of Rs 1,350 per quintal but now the authorities are grading the produce at three levels and giving the farmers a rate of Rs 1,100, Rs 1,250 and Rs 1,350 after gradation by a Gurgaon based firm-SGS India Pvt Limited.

While the agency officials said they were instructed by the higher authorities to make purchases after gradation and most of the Basmati of this area is of Cgrade, getting Rs ''1,100 per quintal, the farmers termed the gradation of the produce at that juncture as unjustified and a device to loot the farmers.

They pointed out that they had sown the seed supplied by Punjab Agro at the rate of Rs 36 per kg and now the agencies were cheating them by using the yardstick of grading.

4,Four jail wardens arrested,"KOLKATA: The state jail department got a drubbing on Tuesday when CID sleuths arrested four Dum Dum Central Jail warders for helping Sheikh Vinod''s daring jailbreak on September 25.

Earlier, jail warden Ramji Singh had been arrested on similar charges. The four were picked up from the jail and its adjoining quarters by plainclothesmen.

Swapan Chakraborty, Pradip Dutta, Sadhucharan Sarkar and Rabindranath Mondal will be produced in court on Wednesday.

IG (prisons) Joydeb Chakraborty said his department was yet to get a detailed report from the CID. ""Once we get that, the four will be suspended,"" he said.

The developments came after ex-convict Chaitanya Pal''s told the detectives that the four had helped them to plot a jailbreak twice earlier. Once they had attempted to flee using a drain pipe and later by cutting the iron bars. However, they had backed off when other prisoners saw them.

The day when gangster Sheikh Vinod, his three aides Rajesh Khan, Shiu Kumar Rajak, Ram Babu and Myanmarese drug-runner Baikha Kema escaped from the jail, the four along with Singh had actively helped them. Now, all expect Kema have been caught.

Jail officials had claimed after the incident that there was nothing amiss when a routine count of prisoners was taken before lunch around noon.

However, during the postlunch count at 1.30 pm, the jail staff found five undertrials missing. The police were informed almost an hour later.

5,TDP holds rally against 'encroacher' Sultan,"KHAMMAM: The alleged encroachment of forest land by the former Congress MLA from Khammam, Yunis Sultan, has given the local TDP a shot in the arm.

The ruling party took out a rally on Tuesday and staged a rasta roko demanding immediate arrest of Yunis Sultan for allegedly violating the Forest Act and taking up illegal construction on the encroached land.

Khammam divisional forest officer Vinay Kumar said that a case was filed against former MLA Sultan for encroaching 12 acres of the Velugumatla Forest Reserve on the outskirts of the town under Section 20 (1)-2-7 of the Forest Act of 1967, 1980.

In 1988, Sultan purchased 10 acres of land to set up an engineering college and later allegedly encroached two acres of the abutting forest land. The forest department served notices on him and stopped construction activity in the encroached land. Sultan approached the high court in April 2002 and the court declared that the MLA had encroached two acres of forest land and asked him to pay Rs 13,000 per acre. Sultan paid Rs 26,000 to the forest department through court.

The forest department, not satisfied with the judgment, went for further appeal on Jan.4, this year. The case is still pending in the court.

However, a case was also booked against Sultan on Nov. 20 by the forest department in which they mentioned that the MLA had begun construction work illegally in the disputed land of two acres, even before it was handed over to him.

The TDP district unit, based on the forest department information, took out a massive demonstration from the party office to Mayuri centre, demanding the arrest of Sultan. Municipal chairperson Nagamallika, District Co-operative Central Bank chairman Balasani Laxminarayana, Women Finance Corporation chairperson Baby Swarnakumari, all contenders for the Khammam Assembly seat, led the rally on Tuesday and held a rasta roko. Reacting to the allegations, Sultan said that the high court judgment was clear and there was no mention of handing over land to the forest department. He dubbed the case as â€˜politicallyâ€™ motivated.

7,CPI-ML concerned at Assam violence,"SAMASTIPUR: Expressing his serious concern over the continued attack on Biharis living in Assam, the state unit secretary of the CPI-ML, Ramjatan Sharma, has asked all the progressive forces, including the labour parties, to come forward to condemn the violence.

The ML leader charged the political parties like the Congress, the BJP and the RJD with being responsible for what was happening in Bihar and Assam. He said that the ML was campaigning in Assam over the issue of security of Biharis and was effectively dealing with riotous elements there.

Inaugurating the two-day district convention of the CPI-ML here on Monday, Sharma attacked the Centre for its wrong economic policies which had resulted in unemployment, regional imbalances and widespread corruption.

He further said that there was an immediate need to change the new economic policy of the Centre.

Sharma held RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav responsible for the bad image of Bihar. He said that Laloo''s misrule earned a bad name for Bihar everywhere outside the state.

8,"Hackers strike sites at will, govt helpless","HYDERABAD: The hacker is on the prowl and the government can do little to stop him in his tracks. At least, thatâ€™s what the IT department â€” custodian of the government web sites and servers â€” says.

Hackers, sources say, have been having a field day. Working from remote locations, theyâ€™ve repeatedly broken into the Secretariat and other government networks at will. Making matters worse, these techno-wizards reportedly have access to the e-mail accounts of key government officials, as well.

The government hasnâ€™t a clue to these intrusions. But department officers concede: Itâ€™s likely that the hackers are feasting on its web sites and servers. â€œItâ€™s easy for anyone to hack the government servers since we (the government networks) donâ€™t have basic security features like a firewall,â€� IT secretary J C Mohanty told The Times of India.

Darren Warren (name changed on request) â€” a US-based hacker working for a city-based e-security solutions firm â€” boasts he has hacked several government web sites and servers at the behest of his employer.

Asked about Warrenâ€™s claim, Mohanty merely says: â€œThe government is in the process of deploying security solutions to protect its network. However, the government has no intention of launching any investigation into the matter. We canâ€™t carry out any probe into this, since the network is not properly secured. Once we have proper security features, weâ€™ll have a strong case to fight these intruders.â€� Warren says he hacked the government web sites and servers to download important data. In addition to hackers, a wide variety of viruses have been feasting on government-owned computers and servers. Mohanty insists the problem would soon be solved. â€œWe have invited bids from security solution providers. The work will be complete by Jan. 15, 2004,â€� he added.

9,Accident sparks protest,"HYDERABAD: A young man died under the wheels of a trailer at Panjagutta Crossroads on Tuesday morning. Passers-by alleged that the traffic police was responsible for the accident, leading to mild tension in the area.

The deceased was identified as Sashikant, a native of Eluru. The truck driver surrendered after the incident.

Police sources said Sashi-kant was coming from Ame-erpet on a two-wheeler. He was held up in traffic at the Panjagutta Crossroads. The traffic had been blocked to let the chief ministerâ€™s convoy through. There was some unrest as the traffic was stopped before the scheduled time. A policeman gave a green signal and the huge trailer took off without noticing Sashi-kant. The trailer travelled some 20 metres, dragging the two-wheeler and crushing Sashikant to death.

Passers-by protested in front of the police station. Top police officers rushed to the spot and pacified the mob.

10,Sinchai Bhavan gheraoed,"PATNA: Government engineers on Tuesday gheraoed Sinchai Bhavan as part of their phase-wise agitation to protest the kidnapping of Kaimur-based executive enginner and assistant engineer, Dinesh Chowdhary and Harendra Dubey, respectively.

The engineers were sore over the kidnapping of the two engineers from their residences on November 13 and the police failure to recover them till date.

The kidnapped engineers belong to the water resources department.

Apart from the members of Bihar Engineering Services Association (Besa), members of Subordinate Engineers Association, Mechanical Engineers Association, Electrical Engineering Services Association and Junior Power Engineers Association also participated in the gherao.

In order to intensify their agitation, engineers would block the main entrance of Vishveswaraiyya Bhavan on November 27, Vikas Bhavan on November 28 and Vidyut Bhavan on November 29.

If it fails to goad the government into action to recover the kidnapped engineers, the coordination committee of the engineering associations would chalk out its future course of action, including a possible indefinite strike.

Engineers have also demanded that all their colleagues working in the Durgawati water reservoir project be provided with adequate security, and Rohit Kumar Jha, who was kidnapped on December 2, 2002, from Saharsa, be rescued immediately.

Otherwise, they would be forced to stop all developmental schemes in the state, they warned.

11,SC stays arrest of IAS officer,"PATNA: Even as a Patna police team proceeded to Delhi to arrest IAS officer V Jaishankar, the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the execution of the non-bailable warrant issued by the Patna High Court against the officer.

Noted lawyer Kapil Sibal pleaded Jaishankar''s Special Leave Petition that came up for hearing before a Supreme Court bench consisting of the Chief Justice of India and two other judges.

The Patna HC had issued the arrest warrant after Jaishankar failed to appear in the court in a case related to non-payment of dues of an employee, Krishna Saha.

The officer has blamed government pleader V N Sinha for misleading the Patna HC that he was evading court appearance.

In a letter written to Sinha on November 20 from Delhi, Jaishankar has expressed shock over a non-bailable warrant issued against him by the HC when till date he had not been served any notice for appearance in the case and he was exempted from appearing in person on November 5.

Earlier in the Patna High Court, government pleader V N Sinha expressed his ""inability"" to defend Jaishankar further as the latter had lost faith in him and the IAS Officers'' Association too had passed a resolution against his conduct.

The court then said that he need not appear for the ""contemner"", but as a government counsel he could continue to appear for the state.

He said that he did not know about summons being issued for his appearance till Sinha contacted him on phone at around 12.15 pm on November 20 and told him that the court was furious with his orders and he had been called to appear at 1 pm.

""It is surprising that you have kept me in the dark and not informed me or my office about serious developments,"" the IAS officer has alleged.

Jaishankar stated that he had to airdash to Delhi to attend to his ailing mother-in-law. Earlier in the Patna High Court, government pleader V N Sinha expressed his ""inability"" to defend Jaishankar further as the latter had lost faith in him and the IAS Officers'' Association too had passed a resolution against his conduct.

The court then said that he need not appear for the ""contemner"", but as a government counsel he could continue to appear for the state.

Commenting over the constitution of the association by IAS officers, Justice Prasad observed, ""It is unfortunate. Even IAS officers, who are members of the high executive body, were required to form an association. It is not expected from them. They want the entire system to collapse and in that case neither I shall be here nor they will be there. But I will try my best to maintain the system and abide by my oath of office, which I took as a judge.""

12,Cong support needed to pass Temple law: Mahajan,"JAISALMER: A legislation for construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya could be passed in the forthcoming Winter Session of Parliament if the Congress party supports it, BJP General Secretary Pramod Mahajan said here on Wednesday.

""If the Congress assures, the BJP-led NDA government will move a Bill on it in the Winter Session of Parliament,"" Mahajan told reporters.

He said the decades old issue could be solved if Members of Parliament devoted to Lord Ram came out in full majority in Parliament.

The Bill for construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya can be introduced in the Lok Sabha after getting a Cabinet nod, he said.

Observing that the Ram Temple issue had got momentum several times in the past, Mahajan said a court verdict on basis of the Archaeological Survey of India excavation report, a general consensus or a majority to the BJP in the next general elections could provide a solution problem.

15,Infusing fragrance into lives of tribal farmers,"SURAT: Tribal farmers Sukurbhai Choudhary and Suresh Choudhary of Ishar village in Surat district have been toiling for years in their fields, just like their forefathers did for generations.

But the yield of traditional crops like maize, millets, etc., were never enough to get them beyond the subsistence level. But, today the smile on their face says it all.

Only recently, they switched over to the cultivation of aromatic plants. Some weeks back, they harvested the first crop of mentholmint with an average yield of over 22 kg from an acre of land and each earned about Rs 6,000.

In the next few days each of them would be richer by another Rs 6,000, as the second crop, which has a gestation period of 90 days, would be ready for reaping.

In a year, every farmer in the region would earn from Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 by cultivating aromatic plants like mentholmint, lemon grass, citronella, palmarosa and â€˜tulsiâ€™ from one acre of land, according to the project administrator of tribal development, M R Katara. With technical assistance from Fragrance Flower Development Centre (FFDC) at Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh, aromatic plants were cultivated on an experimental basis on about 10 acres of land in Surat, Valsad, Dahod and Bharuch districts with cent per cent subsidy from the state government.

Though the results are yet to be assessed in other places, the yield in the case of mentholmint at Ishar village in Mandvi taluka has been very encouraging. Eight more farmers have now joined the bandwagon. Interestingly, these aromatic plants are the basic essence of many perfumes, toothpastes and ayurvedic medicines.

Even though the climatic conditions are conducive here, growing these aromatic plants was never taken up because of lack of awareness. Gujarat produces only three per cent of the total production of aromatic plants in the country and there is tremendous potential to substantially increase the share.

With financial assistance of Rs 9.50 lakh from the state government and free supply of seeds from FFDC last year, tribal farmers were encouraged to grow these cash crops under various tribal development schemes. Since the crop could be reaped every three months, the per acre yield in a year could be four times and the returns are lucrative and quick due to high demand in the market.

However, the cultivation of other aromatic plants except for mentholmint is still in the experimental phase in and around Ishar village. Katara said that 100 other farmers have been offered technical assistance if they plan to switch over to the cultivation of aromatic plants in this tribal belt.

And for the time being, gone are the days of penury for the Choudhary farmer duo who have the credit of being the first in the state to cultivate aromatic plants on a commercial basis.

They now believe that growing aromatic plants would lead to the economic prosperity of the tribals of the region, which was evading them till recently.

16,Anxiety at SLIMS after arrest of Shastris,"AHMEDABAD: The atmosphere at the Som Lalit Institute of Computer Studies (SLIMS) is subdued. The impact of the arrests of the instituteâ€™s director Pragnesh Shastri, and his father and former V-C of Gujarat University (GU) KS Shastri, is palpable.

The Shastris and former registrar of GU MP Jadia were arrested on various charges of corruption and have been taken in police remand for further questioning. Students could be seen discussing the latest controversy, in hushed tones.

They seemed defensive and refused to talk openly about the repercussion of the scandal that has hit SLIMS. â€œThe arrests have not affected the functioning of the classes. So, we are not worried about what is going to happen now,â€� said an MBA student.

When asked if the reputation of the college had taken a beating, another student said: â€œNot at all. In fact, even after the controversy, all 60 seats in the MBA course have been filled up.â€�

â€œI am planning to do my MBA in some other institute,â€� confided a BBA student, in his last year. â€œI feel this institute has been charging a lot of fee from students.â€�

The Shastris have now filed a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court challenging the sessions courtâ€™s remand order.

In the application advocate Ashok Shah submitted that the move (remand) was unwarranted as the facts stated in the police complaint have not been properly substantiated. The court has issued a notice to the state government directing them to file a reply by Thursday.

The city police had got a tip-off that Golawala was coming to Petlad along with others in a car. That car did come to Petlad.

The policemen also identified the house, which Golawala was supposed to visit, but a raid there proved futile as Golawala had escaped just a few minutes before raid. Golawala has eluded arrest ever since a mob freed him Vhorwad locality in Wadi.

The police party that arrested him was attacked by the mob. Later Golawala allegedly surfaced at Juhapura in Ahmedabad where he was involved in the murder of one Rasul Ghanchi. Since then, sources said, he was not spotted.

Officials maintained that their information was precise and Golawala did visit the town. He might have left minutes before the party raided the area.

18,Assam govt for CBI probe,"GUWAHATI: The Assam government has decided to ask for a CBI probe into the recent killing of Biharis in the state.

â€œWe have decided for the CBI probe because if the state government was to conduct the probe then the Opposition parties will allege that it was one-sided,â€� chief minister Tarun Gogoi told a press conference here on Wednesday.

â€œWe will soon write to the Centre for a CBI probe. All the facts should be revealed as to who was responsible for the attacks,â€� he said.

Dismissing claims by the BJP and the RSS that illegal Bangladeshi migrants were behind the attacks, the chief minister said there was no evidence.

Reiterating that the carnage took place due to lack of sufficient security force, Gogoi said of late 15 more companies of para military force had arrived, raising the strength to 125 companies in the state.

Earlier in the day, the chief minister had said that the decision on instituting a CBI probe will be taken at a cabinet meeting on Thursday.

The CM also clarified that the killing of two Bihari women in Tinsukia on Wednesday early morning had nothing to do with ethnic violence.

19,Illegal squatters get minister's protection,"MUMBAI: For the first time, a ministerâ€™s interference in the removal of unauthorised shanties coming in the way of a new road between Wadala and Sion has been put on record by the police.

Senior inspector of Antop Hill police station, D.S. Benjamin, said he was under instructions from minister of state for home (rural) Kripa Shankar Singh not to provide police protection to a demolition squad, which wanted to remove illegal squatters at Wadala.

They are mainly migrants from outside Maharashtra. The minister, on his part, defended his action and told TNN that he only wanted to ensure that slumdwellers eligible for rehabilitation were not unfairly targeted.

""I did it at the request of local corporator Ravi Raja,"" he said. In the past, there have been several cases where Mr Singh has been accused of obstructing demolition work, especially in areas like Bandra, Khar and Santa Cruz. Early this year, the Lok Ayukta had pulled up Mr Singh and another minister for abusing their position by protecting four encroachers in Vakola.

""On October 28, 2003, the minister gave us directions over the phone not to give police protection,"" Mr Benjamin admitted in a letter to the estate manager of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).

TNN has a copy of Mr Benjaminâ€™s letter. The MMRDA is constructing a new road that will connect the onekm stretch between IMAX at Wadala and Sion junction. It is currently occupied by encroachers, who have constructed pucca structures.

On October 20, the authority had asked the local police for security cover in case there was trouble in removing dozens of unauthorised slum-dwellers, who had been identified as not being eligible for alternate accommodation under the governmentâ€™s slum rehabilitation scheme.

About 160 shanties have already been removed and their occupants have been rehoused elsewhere because their structures existed prior to January 1, 1995â€”the cut-off date for shanties to be declared as protected. However, about 80 slum-dwellers were found to be illegal and hence ineligible for rehabilitation as they were found to be in the post-1995 category.

""The minister was categorically told that these structures are unauthorised and fit for demolition,"" an MMRDA official said. A committee appointed by the collectorâ€™s office had also found that these slum-dwellers did not have any documents to prove that they were eligible for alternate accommodation.

Yet, Mr Singh apparently called the Antop Hill police and told them that he was discussing the matter with chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde.

""The minister has no jurisdition in this matter. He has been trying to play all kind of tricks to prevent the demolition of these shanties,"" said Magsaysay award winner A. Jockin, who is involved in rehousing the Wadala slum-dwellers.

""The demolition programme has been postponed twice because of the ministerâ€™s interference. The contractors appointed for the road work are sitting idle,"" the MMRDA official said.

In May, Lok Ayukta V.P. Tipnis had indicted Mr Singh and housing minister Sayyed Ahmed for ""abusing their position"" and protecting four encroachers on a plot allotted to an educational institution at Vakola, Santa Cruz.

The report slammed Mr Singh for directing the authorities to stop the demolition of illegal hutments despite the Bombay high court ruling that the tenants were encroachers. Sometime back, Mr Singh had also prevented the clearance of slums surrounding the Mumbai airport.

20,Five arrested for rioting in Gurgaon,"GURGAON: A leather factory was ransacked and 30 vehicles torched after a dispute broke out between two groups over collection of funds at Udyog Vihar in Gurgaon. Five persons were arrested from the spot for rioting.

The mob set afire close to 10 cars and more than 20 two-wheelers parked at the Kabir Leather Export Factory.

A senior police officer denied that the violence was communal. â€˜â€˜It was essentially a dispute between the same community,â€™â€™ he said. According to him, the dispute broke out between two groups of Muslims after they had offered prayers on the occasion of Eid. The police said that the donations were being collected on the instructions of the local clergy.

The miscreants claimed that an object was thrown at them from inside the factory. The owner of the factory, Vikram Sekhri, denied the allegation.

â€˜â€˜The factory opened as usual at 9 am. We were working inside when suddenly, they started pelting stones at us at 9.30 am. Soon, they stormed the factory tried to set it afire. They also set fire to the vehicles on the premises,â€™â€™ said Sekhri. Nearly a 100 bicycles parked near the factory were also torched.

The police said that the mob broke the windowpanes of the factory and set on fire the store units.
