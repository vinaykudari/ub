0,Pass percentage in government schools improves,"NEW DELHI: The pass percentage in government schools has increased by 0.73% in 2004. Number of Class 12 government school students who passed this year is 77.82% as compared to 77.09% last year. While the pass percentage of private school students has reduced from 90.48% to 89.59 %.

Referring to the results in the 1,200 government schools, Delhi education minister A S Lovely said, ""The results have been encouraging. Despite the fact that teachers had been diverted for election duty, our students have done well. It is important to maintain the same standard.""

Incidentally, schools in the New Delhi district registered the highest pass percentage of 82.9%, while south west B district has showed most improvement by reaching a high of 82.5% as compared to last year''s 75.41%.

In the national scenario where India has registered an increase of 2.41% from last year result, Delhi has notched an increase of 1.12% which includes the pass percentage of government, aided and private schools.

The total number of government school students that appeared has also increased from 47,584 students in 2003 to 54,319 students this year. There is an increase of 6,735 students in government schools as compared to a 3,685 students in private schools and a mere 503 in government-aided schools.

Lovely added that several new initiatives like accountability of teachers and regular tests that will reflect in the annual evaluation, were in the pipeline and are likely to be introduced in the new session. ""We would like to maintain quality of education and emphasise on extra-curricular activities also,"" Lovely said.

When asked about the dip in the performance of public schools, the principal of a public school said: ""The paper is set in a way that most students pass. However, the emphasis of our schools is on scoring higher marks and not just passing the examination. Moreover, the question papers this time were not in proportion to the difficulty level of the syllabus, especially science and the performance there has seen a slight dip.""

1,SGPC polls: Tohra men moved,"AMRITSAR: Alwinderpal Singh Pakhoke, acting president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, transferred loyalists of late Gurcharan Singh Tohra from key posts on Wednesday.

The re-shuffle has been carried out without consulting SGPC chief honorary secretary Manjit Singh Calcutta.

Sources said former personal assistant of Tohra has been transferred as additional secretary, library. He has been replaced by Raghubir Singh. Superintendent Kuldip Singh Bawa has been sent to Shahbad, Haryana. Some other Tohra men have also been moved.

Calcutta told TNN that Pakhoke had not spoken to him about the transfers, nor had he taken the five-member committee set up to run SGPC affairs into confidence.

2,Another blow to Chautala govt,"CHANDIGARH: Close on the heels of the ruling Indian National Lok Dal''s debacle in the recent Lok Sabha elections in Haryana, CBI searches on Wednesday at the residences of some of the close aides of chief minister Om Prakash Chautala in connection with the probe into the alleged bungling in the 1999-2000 selection of nearly 4000 JBT teachers in the state has further tarnished its image.

At the same time, the question being raised in political and administrative circles here is whether the CBI has carried out these searches in a bid to cover up its slow progress in the probe, which was started in December last on the direction of the Supreme Court, or these searches are just the outcome of the change of government at the Centre. The apex court had directed the CBI to complete the probe in six months, i.e. by this month-end.

In view of the fact that the new ruling alliance at the Centre is still busy with the nitty-gritty of government formation, the second possibility can possibly be ruled out. In fact, what seems to be more convincing is that the CBI, through these searches, is trying to strengthen its own case to seek more time from the apex court to complete the probe. Widespread searches carried out on Wednesday is a clear indication that it will not be possible for the CBI to complete the probe in time as only a couple of days are left now for it to meet the deadline set by the court.

On the political front, these searches are certainly a jolt to the ruling party which is still reeling under the impact of setbacks suffered by it in the recent parliamentary elections in the state. What is more discomforting for it is that it will have to again face the electorate in the coming Assembly elections scheduled for March next year.

On the one hand, the ruling party claims that the selection of candidates for vacant government posts have been made on the basis of merit, on the other, the state has been rocked by such job scams as the JBT teachers'' selection in which the actual list of selected candidates was allegedly tampered with by the political bosses to accommodate candidates of their choice.

There is no denying that the INLD will find it hard to convince the people of the fairness in the recruitments made during its tenure for other government departments.

3,BJP debates selection criteria for RS candidates,"NEW DELHI: With elections due to 60 Rajya Sabha seats next month, of which the BJP hopes to secure 14 â€” one more than the 13 who are retiring â€” there is a debate on in the party about the criteria both for renomination as well as whether those who have just Lok Sabha seats should be accommodated.

There appears to be clarity, party sources said on Wednesday, that BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu (from Karnataka), party general-secretary Pramod Mahajan (from Maharashtra) and former Union finance minister Jaswant Singh (from Rajasthan) will be renominated. But with BJP leadership criticising the UPA coalition for making Shivraj Patil, P M Sayeed and Praful Patel â€” all of whom contested and lost in the recent elections â€” ministers, the party is trying to figure out what justification it can give for bringing former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi, former external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha, former petroleum minister Ram Naik and former MoS O Rajgopal â€” all of whom contested and lost â€” into the RS.

In the case of Joshi, Sinha and Naik, one argument for bringing them in is that all three are forceful speakers and the party requires their services in Parliament, especially when playing the role of the principal opposition.

In the case of Joshi, three BJP RS MPs are retiring from UP â€” former telecom and disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, B P Singhal and Dinanath Mishra â€” but the party has enough votes only to win two seats from the state. While Singhal and Mishra, party sources said, are likely to be dropped, Shourie is likely to be renominated. So Joshi could be given the second seat.

However, from neighbouring Uttaranchal, former MoS S P Gautam is retiring and can''t be renominated from the state as the party doesn''t have the numbers there. Gautam is a Dalit and the party does not wish to send out an anti-Dalit message so soon after the elections.

4,State govt still in formation,"BANGALORE: Day 13 has turned out to be propitious for Karnataka. After 13 days of posturing from the day of counting, Karnataka''s coalition partners â€” Congress and JD(S) â€” got down to the drawing board and worked out nitty-gritties of the government ""package"" on Wednesday.

Congress CM candidate and legislature party leader Dharam Singh, who left for New Delhi in the evening accompanied by R.V. Deshpande, D.K. Shivakumar and A. Krishnappa, was unable to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday itself. ""I will be meeting both Soniaji and JD(S) president H.D. Deve Gowda on Thursday. It will all work out well,"" he told The Times of India over phone.

Gowda, who met Sonia, agreed with him. ""Everything will fall in place,"" he said. Singh and Gowda are expected to work out the details of the package before referring it again to Sonia. Gowda, however, indicated that JD(S) had accepted the Congress demand of the CM''s post, as per the Maharashtra model. ""The issues are not Maharashtra or J&K model or portfolios. The issue is how to stop BJP''s growth in the state. We are not power hungry.""

Both parties have drawn up tentative lists of candidates for ministerial posts. JD(S) is insisting on heavyweight portfolios like home, power, finance and water resources. The Congress, however, is equally firm it will not be ""sidelined"" in allocation of top portfolios.

An ""in-principle"" blueprint has been worked out. While JD(S) is slated to get the post of DyCM for Siddaramaiah as well as the Speaker''s post, the Congress is to take the CM and the deputy Speaker''s post.

Sources said all ministerial berths will be divided on a 50:50 basis. ""Both parties need to sit together and divide it correctly, because both our lists might have many from the same community. We have to ensure all regions and castes are duly represented in the ministry,"" they pointed out.

The CM and the DyCM candidates are likely to take oath within the next couple of days, sources said.

""Besides, three seniors on each side might also be sworn in with them, like Mallikarjun M. Kharge, H.K. Patil and Deshpande from Congress and M.P. Prakash, P.G.R. Sindhia and a senior Vokkaliga legislator from JD(S).""

If there is any objection from either party to both the CM and the DyCM posts going to backward class representatives (Singh is Rajput and Siddaramaiah is Kuruba), Prakash, a Lingayat, maybe considered as a second DyCM, along the lines of the Madhya Pradesh model, sources said.

5,Manmohan govt may revive CCPA,"NEW DELHI: The Manmohan Singh government, reverting back to the times of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, is considering revival of the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) as the highest body within the government to take political decisions. On important matters of political concern like Ayodhya or Kashmir, the government will take its decision at the CCPA meetings, according to sources in the government.

The CCPA was done away with by the Vajpayee-led NDA government. The cabinet committee on security (CCS) had replaced it for the last six years, where all matters of political as well as security concerns were decided.

The UPA will continue with the CCS, the other crucial decision-making body, where matters of security concerns will be decided.

As the political head of the government, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will preside over the CCPA, where defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister Shivraj Patil, external affairs minister Natwar Singh and finance minister P Chidambaram will be present.

The Congress leadership is trying to work out whether to give allies representation on the CCPA to avoid any heartburn. Under consideration is a proposal to give the convener, likely to be selected from among the allies of the UPA, a seat at the table. Should that come through, NCP chief and agriculture and food minister Sharad Pawar could be the allies'' representative on the CCPA. The Maratha leader is widely tipped to be the convener of the UPA.

Pawar will be the second non-Congress member of the UPA, if it is decided that allies get membership to the CCPA, as finance minister Chidambaram, despite having won the poll on a Congress ticket is, technically speaking, not a party member yet.

Irrespective of whether Pawar is accommodated or not, the CCPA will, for all practical purposes be a Congress club.

Even in the Vajpayee government''s CCS, NDA convener George Fernandes was the only non-BJP member, but in his capacity as defence minister.

6,Scotland Yard arrests cleric Abu Hamza,"LONDON: In a pre-dawn raid, the Scotland Yard on Thursday arrested controversial cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri here on an extradition warrant issued by the US government.

A spokesman of the Scotland Yard said the 47-year-old cleric was arrested at his home in west London at 3.00 am.

Abu Hamza, who preaches outside the Finsbury Park mosque in north London, will appear at Bow Street Magistrates'' Court later in the day.

He is currently fighting attempts to strip him of his UK citizenship.

The spokesman said Hamza''s home was being searched by anti-terrorist officers under the Extradition Act 2003.

The Egyptian-born preacher is at the centre of a deportation battle with the Home Office, which wants to remove his citizenship, gained through marriage in 1981.

His lawyer has argued that stripping him of citizenship would leave him stateless and would be a breach of his human rights.

He had been a regular preacher at the Finsbury Park mosque until he was banned by the Charity Commission in February 2003 which accused him of abuse of his position for ""personal and political, rather than charitable purposes"".

But Abu Hamza has continued to preach to worshippers outside the mosque, which was closed for repairs after a police raid in January 2003.

He is in the custody of the Metropolitan Police Service anti-terrorist branch in a central London police station.

7,Back to middle path on foreign policy,"NEW DELHI: The Common Minimum Programme seeks to restore a sense of balance in Indian foreign policy by stressing that the country''s strategic interests are better served by striving for a multipolar world rather than identifying too closely with the unilateralism of the United States.

The language and tone of the foreign policy section is muted, but the shifts in emphasis are unmistakable. Relations with the US are given the importance they deserve -- the CMP commits the new government to pursuing ``closer engagement'''' with Washington -- but the document promises that ``the independence of India''s foreign policy position on all regional and global issues'''' will be maintained.

What this means, in concrete terms, is that the Manmohan Singh government is likely to be far less enthusiastic about certain US programmes -- like missile defence or the Proliferation Security Initiative -- which have the potential for destabilising the world and region, than its predecessor was. In sum, the strategic partnership with Washington will continue but the new government will not be as wide-eyed in its approach.

It is in the fitness of things that the CMP gives due importance to South Asia. The dialogue with Pakistan is to be ``pursued systematically and on a sustained basis'''', the latter phrase a dig at the flip-flops that characterised the Vajpayee government''s Pak policy. The UPA will support the peace process in Sri Lanka and will work to resolve outstanding issues with Bangladesh. With Nepal, the CMP proposes to develop water resources to mutual advantage.

On West Asia, the CMP commits the government to support ``the cause of the Palestinian people for a homeland of their own'''' but is silent on what this will mean for Indo-Israeli ties. It also says that steps will be taken to withdraw Indian mercenaries from Iraq and ban further recruitment for this purpose. The NDA government had expressed concern about this trend but failed to take action to stop the activities of recruiting agencies.

Finally, the UPA reiterates its commitment to deepening India''s ties with China, Russia and Europe.
