1,Experts not optimistic of high agricultural growth rate in state,"GANDHINAGAR: Three years ago, Gujaratâ€™s Agro-Vision 2010 had predicted a 6.8 per cent per annum agricultural growth rate. Now, experts feel the target is â€œvery optimisticâ€�.

Farm production in 2003-04, according to latest figures made available by the agriculture department, has been one of the highest in the recent past at 1.77 crore tonnes and the production was exactly 48.57 per cent higher than what it was in 2001-02. But the fact remains that the fluctuations in the stateâ€™s agriculture, still largely rainfed, have been so great that these have marred all predictions of a higher yield. Experts doubt whether the trend will be any different this time.

Experts advising the Gujarat government on improving the state of agriculture do not think that the growth rate over the next five years can rise to the level of 6.8 per cent. One of those involved in working out the action plan for agriculture, IIM-A professor Ravindra Dholakia, for instance, considers this target as â€œvery optimisticâ€�.

The current average is just 3.65 per cent. In a recent paper submitted to the government, Dholakia said: â€œThe Planning Commission has assigned a real growth target of 10.2 per cent per annum for Gujarat during the 10th Five-Year Plan. Accordingly, Gujarat should achieve annual real growth rate of 4.3, 12.23 and 10.44 per cent in primary, secondary and tertiary sectors respectively.â€� The three broadly relate to agriculture, industry and services.

Despite the fact that the state experienced in 2003-04 the highest net sown area since 1980-81, at 97.25 lakh hectares, production of several crops was still not the best. A comparison between official figures for all main crops in 2003-04 and previous years shows that except groundnut, the production was still lower than what has been achieved before. For instance, rice production at 11.93 lakh tonnes was lower than what was achieved for three years, from 1996-97 to 1998-99. Only groundnut experienced 43.32 lakh tonnes production, which was much more than the highest achieved in 2001-02, at 26.46 lakh tonnes.

â€œSchemes to provide water for irrigation to another two lakh hectares in a year and adoption of sprinkler and drip will help sustain a higher growth,â€� says state agriculture minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma. Meanwhile, the state has been working on plans to make farmers choose the crops that can achieve better productivity and cash.

2,Sonia tests party waters on coalition,"NEW DELHI: Back from a tough campaign trek, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had a busy Sunday talking to senior party leaders in the state capitals about the party''s possible move after the election results are announced.

According to Congress sources, Sonia was on the phone discussing the party''s response to various post-poll scenarios with Congress chief ministers, state unit chiefs and other important leaders.

Her phone-in initiative followed a meeting of the party general-secretaries on Saturday to take stock of the situation before the final round of polling on Monday.

""Reports from sources indicate a highly favourable climate for the Congress,"" party spokesman S Jaipal Reddy said.

Dismissing the pollsters'' predictions as incorrect, he questioned the BJP motive behind focussing on the stability plank. ""It is nothing but a defensive operation,"" Reddy said.

During Sonia''s telephonic talks with the party leaders, the question of whether the Congress should make an attempt at government formation came up prominently, sources said.

She apparently sounded out the state party bosses for their views on such a possibility. Some of the Left leaders have pressured the Congress to explore every avenue to form a ""secular"" government in a scenario in which the NDA is well ahead of the Congress-led alliance but short of a simple majority.
