1,Revenue dept officers face increasing threat,"PATNA: Officials of the commercial taxes, registration and excise departments â€” known as the â€œmoney-making departmentsâ€� in Bihar â€” are facing an increasing threat from extortionists and kidnappers. Registration department officials have submitted a memorandum to their commissioner, seeking police protection for ensuring that they do their duty â€œfearlesslyâ€�.

The commercial taxes deputy commissioner in Biharsharif went on a long leave after receiving threats allegedly from Subhash Yadav, RJD MLC and brother of chief minister Rabri Devi, on the question of issuing no-objection as well as no-dues certificates to a country and spiced liquor baron. The Nalanda DM is reported to have sent an SOS to the commercial taxes commissioner, indicating that the work suffers due to the officialâ€™s long absence.

An excise official posted in Jehanabad, Jugal Kishore, was killed for daring to detain the brother-in-law of a liquor trader in the district for not clearing the departmentâ€™s dues.

â€œItâ€™s becoming extremely difficult for officials of our department to work with the kind of people coming into the liquor trade,â€� stated assistant commissioner of Patna Manindra Kumar while maintaining that the traders are not only trigger-happy but also well-connected. After Jugal Kishoreâ€™s murder, excise officials threatened to lock up their offices if the police failed to arrest the culprits reportedly having close links with members of the ruling party.

In 1996, excise official Rajani Kant was killed. In 2000, a clerk of the department was shot dead on the office premises. In Gaya, the family of an official was forcibly lifted from their home and photographed naked for blackmailing as also an assistant commissioner beaten up. An official in Rohtas received threats. All this because they either gave or did not give licences to some persons or demanded payment of the departmentâ€™s dues.

â€œAll sorts of elements, including criminals and politicians, are getting attracted to the liquor trade for making instant wealth,â€� observed excise minister Shivanand Tiwari, adding, â€œOur personnel are uniformed but they are without arms. For conducting raids, we are given homeguards. Very few DMs are willing to provide police support to excise officials.â€� The rampant corruption in these departments is the main factor contributing to the vicious and violent environment prevailing there.

2,Don't use Kalam for political ends: Paswan,"VADODARA: A person of the stature of eminent scientist A P J Abul Kalam should not dragged into controversy and his name should not be exploited for political ends by the ruling coalition at the Centre. Former Union minister and MP from the Lok Janashakti Party (LJP), Ram Vilas Paswan, said this while speaking to mediapersons here on Wednesday. Paswan said that the move by the ruling coalition to name Kalam as a candidate for the presidential race was an attempt to play the minority card. ""This is very unfortunate. While there may be little opposition to Kalam''s candidature, the fact remains that his name has been proposed when there is extreme controversy over the appointment of the president. The BJP should have avoided this,"" he said. Paswan also came down heavily on the fact that the ruling coalition has made no effort to build a consensus over the appointment. ""They came up with one name or the other and then asked the Opposition to agree. Instead, they should have consulted us before propping up a name,"" he pointed out. Paswan, who is in the state to tour the riot-affected areas, said that the riots were preplanned. He went to the extent of saying that the communal tension may not end till the ensuing Assembly polls. ""It is ironical that the state government is still not concerned about restoring peace. Instead, they want polls,"" he said. Paswan also came down heavily on Governor Sundar Singh Bhandari for not coming out openly against the violence of the state. ""He did not open his mouth during the entire episode. We still do not know whether he has sent a report on the Gujarat violence to the centre,"" Bhandari said. Paswan and senior LJP member Arif Mohammed Khan severely criticised statements by Chief Minister Narendra Modi that Pakistan was responsible for the violence in Gujarat. ""No such observation was made by any senior central minister. It is obvious that Modi is trying to pass the buck,"" Paswan said. Paswan, meanwhile, said that his party would work extensively in Gujarat to bridge the communal void. It has planned a series of programmes including token fasts and meetings between members of different communities for the purpose, he said.

3,Municipal polls postponed in 88 areas,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has decided to postpone elections to 88 municipalities for four more months.

A state urban development department notification, issued here on Wednesday, said the postponement was on account of the monsoon.

Elections to two district panchayats, Kheda and Banaskantha, and five taluka panchayats too have been postponed. The state election commission has been conveyed about the decision.

The notification said, ""It is not possible to hold free and fair elections before the completion of the duration of monsoon for reconstituting such municipalities"" where polls have been pending. Polls to the local bodies, due way back in 2000, were first postponed on November 15, 2000, under the pretext of ""unprecedented drought"".

Then, on March 5, 2001, ""natural calamities"", including earthquake, became the reason for postponement.

Thereafter, the polls were postponed on September 6, 2001. And, again on March 13, 2002, they were put off due to ""communal disturbances"". It is not known whether the latest postponement means both the Assembly and local body polls will be held simultaneously some time in mid-October.

5,PCB functions without rules,"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board enjoys a dubious distinction of being the only board in the country to function without staff service rules. Such rules are essential to determine transfers, promotions and qualifications required for a post. The plan to introduce staff service rules was included in the 1998-1999 APPCB action plan, but as on date, no rules have been framed. Staff service rules are applicable to permanent staff and the APPCB has over 300 such employees. The decisions that are to be based on staff service rules are now taken by a committee consisting of a representative of the administrative department, the additional secretary and the chief accounts officer. In 1998-1999 the duty of preparing staff service rules was given to the joint chief environmental engineer (JCEE). However, this was not done. Subsequently, in 1999-2000 the responsibility was given to the senior consultant-administration and the same official was responsible for it in 2000-2001. However, this year the responsibility of preparing staff service rules has been given to the additional secretary. â€œAll pollution control boards in the country have staff service rules but the APPCB never had such rules since its inception. Though efforts have been made to form rules nothing has been done so far,â€� a APPCB official said. In addition, the APPCB does not have a chief environmental engineer (CEE) and this post has been vacant for the past five years.

6,Casualty sans equipment,"NEW DELHI: There are only a handful of hospitals in Delhi that provide facilities for surgery round-the-clock. In the event of an emergency, be it a road accident or a house collapse, victims have a chance only if they reach a tertiary-level hospital. If providence takes them to a lower-level hospital, they are invariably referred out. Most lower and peripheral hospitals do not provide surgery facilities after routine hours. This means, after 4 pm, emergency services in these hospitals virtually come to a standstill. Nevertheless, there isnâ€™t a single 100-bed hospital without a 24-hour emergency wing. City health minister A K Walia disagrees. â€˜â€˜All our hospitals, both secondary and tertiary, carry out surgeries day and night. Only if a patient has a serious head injury or requires super-specialty treatment, do doctors refer him out.â€™â€™ Clearly, Walia is unaware of the ground realities. Most of his peripheral hospitals not only have an acute shortage of staff but also suffer from lack of infrastructure and equipment. And it is not just about surgery. Even essential life-saving equipment such as defibrilators and ventilators are not available in required numbers. A defibrilator gives out an electric impulse that helps in reviving the heart of a patient suffering from a cardiac arrest. Ventilators are used for every unconscious patient and provides artificial respiration. Many a times serious patients are turned away by hospitals for want of a free ventilator. Principal secretary (health) S P Aggarwal said: â€˜â€˜We are in the process of purchasing ventilators for several hospitals. Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital has asked for 15 and Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital wants three ventilators.â€™â€™ Maharishi Valmiki Memorial hospital in Pooth Khurd in north Delhi got its 24-hour emergency wing in January 2002. Medical superintendent Dr S P Baruah said: â€˜â€˜Before the wing was started I asked for a minimum of 17 specialist doctors. But only seven have been roped in. We are severely understaffed.â€™â€™ Asked about surgeries, he said with a laugh: â€˜â€˜We have two posts for anaesthesia specialists and four for senior resident doctors. But we have only one specialist and one resident doctor. Obviously, we donâ€™t conduct surgeries after 4 pm.â€™â€™
