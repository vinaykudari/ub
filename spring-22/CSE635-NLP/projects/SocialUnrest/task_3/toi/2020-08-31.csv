0,Terrorist running parallel govt in northeast: VHP,"KOCHI: VHP International Vice-President Acharya Giriraj Kishore today alleged that certain terrorist organisations were running a parallel government in the northeast.

These outfits even demanded ''tax'' from traders and government servants, he told reporters here.

""No trade can be conducted without their consent. They have their embassies in Singapore, Bangladesh and Bangkok"", he claimed.

To a query whether Kerala was a troubled state like the northeast, he said ""not in that respect, but it is also troubled"". The first troublesome state was Jammu and Kashmir, and the second was north east. Afterwards all bordering states are in the hit list of ISI, he said adding ""but now Kerala is changed"".

1,Teachers’ body threatens ‘work-to-rule’ agitation,"AHMEDABAD: Members of the Gujarat State University & College Teachersâ€™ Federation have threatened to launch a â€˜work-to-ruleâ€™ agitation from September 6 if their long-standing demands are not met.

The decision to launch a strike was made after a massive rally was organised in the city on Sunday to draw the attention of the state government towards their long-standing demands. About 4,500 teachers from various parts of the state, including Kutch, Saurashtra, North Gujarat, South Gujarat and Central Gujarat, took part in the rally. The rally passed through the city with members shouting slogans, holding banners and placards highlighting their demands.

Federation president K S Shastri lashed out at the government and said that despite written assurances and promises, the state has not implemented the UGC guidelines for higher education during the past three years.

Federation general secretary J A Chudasma said, â€œThe state government should be ashamed that its unfair polices and the nonimplementation of UGC norms have forced teachers to come out on the streets in protest.â€�

He said that the state is yet to implement UGC guidelines on pay-scale of part-time teachers, physical instructors, librarians, pension options, increment for PhD holders, leave rules, education-improvement schemes, etc.

On September 5, which is Teachersâ€™ Day, teachers and students across villages, towns and cities of the state will take out rallies. They will wear white clothes and rally for public support on issues related to education. And on September 6, the teachers will launch a â€˜work-toruleâ€™ agitation.

â€œThough we discussed our demands with the government during the last three years, the state has not implemented the UGC norms yet. Therefore, we decided to launch a â€˜work-to-ruleâ€™ agitation and will continue with it till our demands are met,â€� said federation secretary K G Mehta.

2,JSM may boycott riot probe panel hearings,"AHMEDABAD: Jan Sangharsh Manch (JSM), a voluntary organisation that has been closely following the hearings of the Nanavati-Shah riot inquiry commission since its inception, may boycott the panelâ€™s hearings henceforth.

JSMâ€™s decision comes in the wake of misbehaviour and noisy protests by a section of depositors when the third phase of hearings by the commission was held at the Circuit House Annexe premises in Ahmedabad on Friday.

A statement issued by JSM convenor Dhanesh Desai said: â€œThe Manch condemns the mob attack at the Circuit House where the commission was conducting its hearings.â€�

Chamanpura residents, who had come in large numbers to depose before the commission, heckled the family members of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri around 5 pm. Jafri was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre in February 2002.

Other riot victims from Gulbarg Society, members of NGOs and mediapersons too were jeered at, heckled and roughed up by the mob despite the presence of a large number of police personnel at the venue.

JSM also feels that the conduct of representatives of the state government appearing before the commission is â€œreprehensible and reflected the biased attitude of the state government towards riot victimsâ€�. The state government representatives have been making wild allegations against riot victims who come to depose before the commission and also against lawyers who assist them.

â€œUnder these circumstances, the Manch is seriously concerned about the security and safety of the riot victims who are appearing before the commission and is contemplating on whether to continue their participation in the commission any further until the safety and security of riot victims are guaranteed,â€� said Desai in the statement.

3,Krishna meets families of farmers who commit suicide,"MANDYA: To counter opposition allegations that the government is indifferent to the plight of farmers, chief minister S.M. Krishna on Saturday visited families of farmers, who have committed suicide in Mandya.

In all, 13 farmers, including one on Saturday, have committed suicide in the district, according to the deputy commissioner. Krishna visited four of these families, which hail from his home constituency Maddur. Krishna, insisting that an entourage should not follow him, came in a small van accompanied by ministers D.K. Shivakumar and B.K. Chandrashekar, legislator D.C. Thammanna and Krishna''s nephew and Mandya ZP president S. Gurucharan.

After a brief stop at Nidugatta to greet Congress workers, Krishna went straight to Hanume Gowda''s house at Bidarahorahalli. He assured the family that: ""The state government will admit children to residential schools and will take care of children''s education."" At Gorananahalli, where Lakshman committed suicide on August 23, he consoled victim''s father and sought medical reports of Lakshman''s brothers, who has just recovered from coma. At Jayamma''s house in Marasinghanahalli, he handed over a cheque of Rs 1 lakh to the bereaved mother, who has lost her son Gurunanjaiah.

Before returning to Bangalore, Krishna went to Huluganahalli and consoled Manchaiah, who has lost his son. At Maddur Travellers'' Bungalow, Krishna reiterated government''s desire to pass an ordinance to regulate private money lenders and prevent loan recovery from struggling farmers. ""One may incur debt, but one should face life with confidence. Farmers should refrain from resorting to the extreme step,'''' he pleaded.

4,Cong trying to thwart Khanna-Badal rally: BJP,"PATHANKOT: While the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) district president Sucha Singh Langah along with other party leaders addressed a rally at Burj Sahib gurdwara at Dhariwal to garner support for the proposed Khanna-Badal rally on September 2, the BJP leaders said the Amarinder Singh government has resorted to preventive arrests of its cadres and clamped ban orders on Sunday to thwart the rally.

Langah along with former ministers Natha Singh Dalam and Nirmal Singh Kahlon exhorted all the jathedars of their circle to bring a large number of people from their respective belts as former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was going to address the rally.

Former BJP minister Satya Pal Saini, in his statement, said that the police had gone to his residence in his absence on Saturday with summons and left a message to appear personally at Shalla police post by Monday.

''''Even if the government clamps ban orders or goes for preventive measures, our leaders and cadres would reach the rally venue in large numbers to make it a grand success,'''' said Saini.

A BJP leader from Purana Shalla said that the police had arrested his brother Davinder and Paramjit Singh and his father Appar Singh and they were being tortured.

Similarly, at a meeting of the alliance partners held at Model Town gurdwara on Sunday evening, both former minister Master Mohan Lal of the BJP and jathedar Dilbagh Singh, SGPC member and senior SAD leader, concurred that a large number of their respective cadres would reach the rally venue to make it a historic one.

Minister of state for external affairs Vinod Khanna, in his statement, said that the government''s ''repressive'' measures to thwart the September 2 rally would backfire on them.

Khanna said that the manner in which the government has decided to clamp preventive measures to thwart the rally would be counterproductive as more than one lakh people would attend it. ''''Come what may, I will reach the venue from Delhi and address the rally,'''' said Khanna.

On the other hand former DCC president Chander Pal Singh said while the credit for the bridge should go to former minister and Congress leader Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder, Khanna wants to take credit for the same keeping in view the ensuing Lok Sabha elections .

5,People want to get rid of INLD govt: Selja,"HISAR: All India Congress Committee secretary Kumari Selja, on Sunday, said that farmers, employees, traders and all other sections of the society were totally fed up with the INLD government and want to get rid of it.

Selja, who was talking to mediapersons at Hansi, said that the government has failed on all fronts while crime has made new records and corruption is rampant.

â€˜â€˜The BJP could not fulfil promises made to the people and after the next elections, Congress would form the government at the Centre and state. If the NDA government is serious about crushing terrorism, it should give more powers to the security forces and latest weapons should be provided to our constables,â€™â€™ she said.

Selja declared that she would contest the Lok Sabha election from Sirsa constituency if the party had no other plans for her.

Condemning the Haryana government, she said, â€˜â€˜The people had never experienced such a bad governance since the creation of Haryana.

The chief minister has done everything for his family and not the people. â€˜â€˜The INLD workers are responsible for goondaism in the state. In lawlessness the state now tops the country.

Chautala boasts of providing all facilities to the farmers but the reality is quite reverse,â€™â€™ she alleged. Be responsive to farmersâ€™ problems: Governor Haryana governor Babu Parmanand, on Sunday, urged the scientists to to be more responsive to the problems of farmers of the state and provide them with need-based technology. He advised them to guide the agriculture department to remove the obstacles of the farming community.

Babu Parmanand visited Haryana Agricultural University on Sunday.

The governor chaired a special session which was held to apprise him of achievements of the university.

6,Highrise fire rules tightened,"KOLKATA: First the good news : those living in the 350-odd multistoreyed buildings constructed since the new millennium which are more than 14.5 metres in height, have no reason to worry about their safety in case a fire breaks out in their apartment.

For, the state fire minister has vouched that his department would simply not give ''No Objection Certificates'' to promoters or house owners, unless they comply with basic fire safety regulations.

The bad news is that the state government doesn''t have a similar ''no nonsense'' rule in place for buildings under 14.5 metres, that is, those less than six storey high.

Nor do they have a fool proof system in place to force older multistoreyed buildings to comply with fire safety norms.

Speaking to TNN, minister of state for fire service Pratim Chatterjee admitted that while ""almost all new multi-storeyed buildings had basic fire safety systems in place, a few older ones could be given the same certificate.""

""Without our final NOC, no new multistoreyed building is given water or power connection by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. As a result even if they do not have sprinklers or smoke alarms in place, most of these multi-storeyed housings have their own water body, trained fire staff and fire extinguishers in place. They also have to construct a fire escape in every house,"" Chatterjee said.

Chatterjee admitted that buildings less than 14.5 metres in height did not fall under this ""strict vigil"" category.

""So, for instance, most housing complexes in Salt Lake or those even in south Kolkata, which are less than five storey in height sometimes do not follow these norms,"" he said.

Director general of fire services V Kumar said even for old buildings, getting promoters or house owners to install fire prevention systems was a tough act.

""As it is we are understaffed. So it is difficult to expect fire personnel to go from house to house to check if fire safety regulations are being followed. However, if we receive any complaints from any old residential or commercial building, we send inspection teams and if we find rules are not being followed, we serve a notice on the housing society or the owner. In most cases, this has done the trick and for their on safety, residents have had extinguishers installed and a separate water tank set up inside the complex,"" Kumar said.

7,Buxar bandh evokes good response,"BUXAR: The Buxar bandh on Sunday called by the Vyavsayi Sangh in protest against the murder of a Jewellery shop owner evoked good response. Almost all shops remained closed during the bandh.

The police resorted to mild lathicharge to disperse bandh supporters at Jamuna Chowk here. The bandh supporters were trying to organise an all-party meeting. The Bandh supporters also shouted slogans against the police. The bandh was also supported by the Chemist and Druggist Association of the district.

More than a dozen people sustained mild injuries in the police lathicharge. Sheojee Verma, a jewellery shop-owner, was gunned down by three motorbike-borne criminals at Turaha toli locality of the town on Saturday in broad daylight. To create panic among other businessmen, the miscreants also fired in the air.

8,'Weird' traffic rule hits schoolchildren,"DANAPUR: Schoolchildren and parents are a harassed lot due to the wilful diversion of school buses in the name of the Chiraiyatand overbridge widening work, which is going on in full swing in Patna these days.

School buses carrying children are not being allowed to cross the overbridge in between 4 pm and 7 pm. As a result, these buses are being diverted to Kadamkuan and Rajendra Nagar to reach Chiraiyatand and Kankarbagh areas. Surprisingly, private buses are allowed to cross the bridge during the particular time from both the Exhibition and Station Road sides, said the aggrieved parents.

They said that the Patna traffic police have banned the entry of heavy vehicles including buses coming from both the Station and Exhibition Roads end from 9 am to 12 pm. Similarly , no vehicles are allowed to cross the bridge between 4 pm and 7 pm from the Kankarbagh and Chiraiyatand end to the Exhibition and Station Road sides, the aggrieved parents said.

According to a resident Sanjeev Nath, whose son, a student of DPS commutes daily by the school bus said that there is no point to divert the school bus since it is an entry time from the Station Road and Exhibition Road sides. Due to unnecessary restriction on the overbridge, his son instead of reaching home at 4 pm, is reaching home around 5.30 pm every day, he said.

9,CPM brass admit rot in party,"KOLKATA: Worried over the party becoming a breeding ground for the likes of Dulal Banerjee, the CPM mandarins, in an internal note, have admitted that the party has become a conglomerate of ""self-seekers, promoters, contractors, middlemen and people who sell workers'' interest for their narrow gains"".

The note also has a word of caution for the party MPs, MLAs, other peoples'' representatives and those holding administrative posts. In many cases, their lifestyle, behaviour and actions are in clear violation of organisational guidelines, it says, indicating that a section of them has already come under the scanner.

The sensitive document, prepared by the CPM state secretariat, will be placed before the party state committee for a threadbare discussion during its two-day meeting slated for September 21 and 22. According to highly-placed sources, the top brass are planning to frame strict guidelines to deal firmly with the situation.

The organisational note admits that the 26-year Left rule in Bengal has definitely led to an erosion of values among a sizeable section of the partymen.

There are partymen who utilise the organisation to eke out a decent living, earn money and acquire social status. There is no dearth of scope for those partymen who want to indulge in corruption.

They are into real estate, supply building materials, fill up ponds, fuel problems in industrial establishments, sacrifice workers'' interests, maintain a close rapport with contractors and finally use the party''s name to earn money, the note states.

Such unprincipled role of partymen has not only weakened the organisation, but also has had an adverse impact on the people, the Alimuddin Street bosses admit. The situation has come to such a pass that at times honest party workers are victimised if they try to raise their voice against corrupt comrades. There are instances where the dishonest partymen have gone scot-free.

The Alimuddin Street note has not even spared ""influential party leaders"", who, by exercising their individual influence, collect substantial funds from their respective areas and spend them according to their own wish.

10,All set for SCA polls in Kangra district,"DHARAMSALA: All preparations have been made for Students Central Association (SCA) elections to be held in colleges of Kangra district on Tuesday. The Akhil Bhartiya Vidayarthi Parishad (ABVP), National Students Union of India (NSUI) and Students Federation of India (SFI) have campaigned intensely for the elections.

The ABVP, which had put up a poor performance last year, has already started with an advantage, as its candidates won the elections unopposed in the evening college.

The regional centre of Himachal Pradesh University (HPU) would witness a straight contest between ABVP and candidates of NSUI-ACS (Azad Chattar Sangathan) combine. The NSUI-ACS combine holds a slight advantage over ABVP in the elections at regional education centre.

However, the NSUI and ACS failed to reach a compromise for the contest in Government Degree College, Dharamsala, and due to this, the contest has become triangular with ABVP also in the fray.

The ABVP would be in an advantageous position due to contest being triangular in the Government Degree College, Dharamsala.

The situation in other remaining colleges of the district was not clear but in most of the colleges, it would be a straight contest between the ABVP and NSUI.

The ABVP has raised the issue of increase in bus fare, shortage of special buses for students and hike in fee as part of its election campaign. The NSUI which had been on the defensive had been highlighting the steps taken by the state government for the welfare of student community in its election campaign.

The performance of the NSUI would be keenly watched as its showing in the elections would determine the popularity of the state government to some extent especially among the youth.

The curtains would come down on campaigning on Monday evening but some of the students said that it would continue in the form of door-to-door contact till the elections were held.

The election campaign in run-up to the elections has been by and large peaceful as no untoward incident occurred.

S Zaidi, SSP, Dharamsala, said that adequate security arrangements had been made for the SCA elections to be held in various colleges of Kangra district on Tuesday.

11,Haryana govt staff to protest SC order on strikes,"YAMUNANAGAR: In protest against the Supreme Court order to ban strikes, the employees of Haryana government departments would hold a demonstration at Hisar on September 26.

Jarnail Singh Sangwan, senior vice-president of Haryana Rajkiya Adhyapak Sangh and vice-president of Sarv Karamchari Sangh, Haryana, in a press release, said here on Monday that in a meeting held at Jind on Sunday it was unanimously decided that the teachers would participate in the rally in large numbers.

He said that it was the democratic right of everybody to protest against injustice. He also lashed out at the state government for adopting a dual policy against the employees. He alleged that the heavy fees structure by the school/college management was putting an additional burden on the parents.

He ridiculed the state government for not taking any initiative to have a uniform policy on education and for not giving standing instructions to the management to adhere to the rules and regulations framed by the education department.

Sangwan further demanded that education should be based on self-employment so that the problem of unemployment could be resolved. He said that the government has not regularised the service of ad hoc and contractual employees. He pointed out that 10,000 posts of teachers are lying vacant in government schools of Haryana, which should be filled immediately.
