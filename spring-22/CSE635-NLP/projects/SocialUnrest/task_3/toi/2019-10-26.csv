0,Loopholes galore in disaster management policy,"GANDHINAGAR: Twenty-one months after Gujaratâ€™s worst disaster struck on January 26, 2001 in the form of a killer quake, the state Cabinet on Thursday rushed to pass a state disaster management policy.

Although it gives an overt emphasis on fighting â€œlarge-scale disasters such as cyclone and earthquakeâ€�, it refuses to take a comprehensive view of disasters.

Dwelling less on industrial and other man-made disasters, its authors in the government seem to have cared little on the frequency with which industrial disasters â€” at Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar â€” have taken place.

Even while talking of the need to formulate â€œa comprehensive policy on all aspects of disaster managementâ€� addressing â€œthe entire gamut of disasters arising out of natural (drought, floods, earthquakes, cyclones) and man-made (oilspills, forest fires, chemical catastrophes),when it comes to â€œearly warning mechanismâ€�, it confines itself to â€œhazards such as cyclones, floods, etc.â€�

The policy, still a discussion document, is quiet on the tangled issue of how powerful should the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA) be in dictating terms to the government departments on disasters. Already working as a state government department, virtually as a part of the chief ministerâ€™s office, the policy just wishes to enhance GSDMAâ€™s role by saying that it should be a â€œnodal agencyâ€� that would â€œfacilitate, coordinate and monitor work for the mitigation and preparedness in regard to disastersâ€�.

There is, in fact, an implicit admission that the GSDMA has not been provided with autonomous powers in the 21 months of its functioning, after the earthquake struck the state. The CMâ€™s principal secretary is also the chief executive officer of the GSDMA, and the stateâ€™s industries commissioner is the GSDMAâ€™s additional CEO. The policy says, â€œThe GSDMA would be provided with statutory powers in its role according to the proposed Gujarat State Disaster Management Act, 2002,â€� but does not say which ones.

Also, there is no clarity on how the statutory body will function when the CMO and the industries department have virtually usurped the GSDMA. There is no direct mention of providing independent powers to the GSDMA to collect funds.

The policy further suggests, â€œThe government would explore innovative means of sharing the costs associated with disasters through risk sharing, risk transfer and other measures which could alleviate the burden on the state exchequer.â€�

1,10 hurt in BJ Medical College violence,"AHMEDABAD: Violence erupted on the notorious BJ Medical College campus around 3 am on Friday, leaving 10 students injured, two of them critically, as news of controversial former Medical Council of India president Ketan Desaiâ€™s chances of exoneration from corruption charges emerged from Delhi.

The day-long celebrations by Desaiâ€™s supporters went on into the wee hours, culminating in a free-for-all.

Over 100 students from the Bblock hostel, representing the North Gujarat lobby that has traditionally been Desaiâ€™s fiefdom, broke into the rival A-block.

â€œHamara baap waapas aa gaya hai. Ab jo karna hai kar lo,â€� announced the emboldened B-block students, many of them reportedly drunk. Armed with steel-pipes, lathis, tubelights and assorted indigenous weapons they attacked students belonging mainly to Saurashtra, the Kutch and outside Gujarat.

During the day, these students along with a few professors, had painted the college red with congratulatory messages as news of the CBI reportedly admitting in the court that there was no evidence of corruption against Desai were received.

At least 10 medicos were injured in the attack that lasted about 20 minutes. Ravi Raj Gohil from Bhavnagar was hit on the head with pipes and lathis. He was rescued and taken to the emergency department when some resident doctors attacked him again outside the casualty ward.

He was admitted to the Rajasthan Hospital. â€œIt may sound ironical, but we donâ€™t think heâ€™ll be safe in the Civil Hospital.â€� said Ravirajâ€™s friend. â€œI came out hearing the noise and was attacked near the steps with steel pipes. My head is splitting,â€� said Kanu Parmar, a second year student.

Eye-witnesses said the alleged perpetrators of the violence include former Junior Doctors Association (JDA) president Deepak Limbachiya, now an assistant professor and senator Jignesh Parmar apart from 15 other. They have been charged with rioting and assault.

This scuffle has come as an embarrassment to the authorities in the Civil Hospital, where health ministers from seven states and 14 health secretaries are camping to deliberate on disaster and health. Later, the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital premises swarmed with police contingent of over 60 personnel, including 15 border-wing personnel.

Two JDA members, Bhavesh Narayanbhai Patel and Jignesh Amrutbhai Parmar (both PG students), were arrested. The JDA has declared a strike against the â€œpolice atrocityâ€�.

â€œAround 400 resident doctors have gone on a strike, demanding the police personnel be suspended,â€� said health minister Ashok Bhatt.

3,Charbagh basks in glory as minister comes calling,"LUCKNOW: For a harried passenger standing in queue for hours at the Railway reservation counter it may sound unbelievable. But Union minister of state for railways AK Moorthy wants to develop Charbagh railway station in international style and as one of the best in the country.This will mean installation of the state-of-art-machines with a touch-button technology at the platforms, which will enable people from different parts of the country to get information in their own regional language and a single telephone inquiry number, which will provide all kind of information to the people on railways, ranging from reservation status to arrival of trains. Besides, comfortable benches and more close-circuit television sets on the platforms as well as in the waiting and retiring rooms, proper drinking water, better lighting and more fans, attentive staff and various other amenities. Last but not the least, he also wants a new beautified look for the railway station with lots of greenery. The minister, who was on a whistle-stop visit of the Charbagh situated Northern and North-Eastern Railways and their hospitals, on Friday, said that the decision to introduce touch-button technology was under consideration. Since people with different language background travelled from one part of the country to another and, often, most of them were not proficient in English or Hindi, would benefit from this technology, he said. The machine will have number of buttons for different languages and a passenger will be able to get information in his/ her own language by pressing the button indicating the particular language.When mediapersons brought to his notice that the IVRS system of the railway inquiry often remained out of order, the minister said that another proposal was under consideration in which it had been suggested that there should be only one railway inquiry number all over India. All other services will be connected through this number. A person dialling this particular number will be connected by the operator to the particular service for the relevant information. The minister arrived in the morning and went straight went to the Railway Indoor hospital in Alambagh where, after inspection, he instructed railway officer to construct a multi-disciplinary training centre for nurses, an AIDS diagnostic centre, a pathology lab and a model children ward. Thereafter he visited railway station platform and gave necessary instructions for improvement of passenger facilities. He was satisfied with the work done after his previous visit and announced a Rs 50,000 award each for the staff of the NR hospital and railway station. He told them that he would be visiting again in January and would like that all instructions were carried out by then. Later, he laid the foundation stone of a 30-bed extension building at the NER hospital in Badshahnagar. There he was joined by state urban development minister Lalji Tandon. Much to the astonishment of railway officers the minister inspected each and every corner of the hospital. He asked officers to remove all the hoardings from within the railway station premises within 24 hours notwithstanding the fact that each hoarding helped NER to earn around Rs one lakh in the form of rent. The minister felt that these hoardings barred the view of the station from the main road. The minister evaded the queries on the railway inquiry on the stampede incident at Charbagh Railway station which left over 20 BSP rallyist dead and scores injured. He also visited RDSO and addressed the officers. Terming RDSO as the brain centre of Indian Railways, he complimented the organisation for ensuring quality products and imparting valuable services to Indian Railways.

4,Mishra: State govt ignoring Muslims,"PATNA: Former chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Jagannath Mishra on Friday said that no work for the welfare of Muslims had been done during the 12-year rule of the RJD in Bihar. Speaking at a felicitation function organised here by the Rashtriya Alpasankhyak Muslim Morcha to celebrate the honour conferred on him by the United Muslim India (UMI), Jama Masjid, New Delhi, and All India Hindi-Urdu Sangam, Lucknow, Mishra said several decisions taken for the welfare of minorities by him during his regime as chief minister were shelved due to his successors' apathy to them.The former chief minister had been conferred with the honour of bakar-e-Urdu by the UMI, the Jama Masjid, New Delhi, and 'Ekta Awadh Samman' by Sangam at Lucknow. Citing the instances, Mishra said about 250 Muslims were killed by extremists' organisations in Imamganj and Dumaria in Gaya district, but no compensation was paid to their families.

5,"Six killed in Ranvir Sena, ML violence","ARA: In a series of killings taking place in â€œpolice presenceâ€�, at least six persons were murdered in four hours in different localities of the extremist-hit Kurmurhi village under the Sikrahata police station of Bhojpur district on Friday.

One person was also injured in the incident which is being attributed to the ongoing war of attrition between the outlawed Ranvir Sena and CPI-ML (Liberation). Police sources confirmed the killing of only four persons till Friday noon, besides one injured. Acute tension prevails in and around the village. Senior officials, including the Shahabad range DIG and Bhojpur SP, were camping there till reports last came in. According to the reports, a septuagenarian Dalit, Channu alias Chanddeo Pasi, was killed allegedly by some Sena men around 6 am on Friday at Kurmurhi.

When the policemen posted at the Kurmurhi picket, escorting Channuâ€™s son Vanshidhar, went to investigate the murder, a band of alleged Sena men opened fire in which Vanshidhar sustained gunshot injury in his leg. In retaliation, some irate villagers also opened fire in which Sakaldeo Singh and Kuldeep Singh, said to be Sena supporters, were seriously injured. They were rushed to the Piro referral hospital where they succumbed to their injuries. Their bodies were sent to the Ara sadar hospital for autopsy. Vanshidhar has been admitted to the sadar hospital.

Vanshidhar, who did not hide his allegiance to the CPI(ML), told TNN that after receiving the news of his fatherâ€™s killing, he immediately rushed to inform the police picket. He was accompanying the policemen when â€œSena menâ€� attacked him. Sources said after a while, a group of â€œarmed Sena menâ€� killed Shiv Kumari Devi, Kunti Rajwar and Bahadur Kanu in different localities of the village. However, Ghanshyam Roy, who accompanied the bodies to the sadar hospital here, said around 6.30 am on Friday, Sakaldeo and Kuldeep were going to attend the call of nature in the field when about two dozen armed men led by the village mukhiya made indiscriminate firing and fatally injured them.

The attack on them aggravated the situation and Channu and Shiv Kumari were killed in retaliatory attacks, Ghanshyam said. Police sources said over 100 rounds were fired by the rival groups. Intensive raids are going on and over a dozen people from both the sides have been taken into custody, they added. The CPI(ML) will observe statewide â€œVirodh Diwasâ€� on October 28 in protest against the killing of its â€œsupportersâ€� at Kurmurhi.

It attributed the incident to the â€œSena-police nexusâ€� in the state, according to a press release issued by CPI(ML) state general secretary Ramjatan Sharma in Patna. The party blamed the RJD-led government for the alleged exploitation of the poor by the Sena, adding that RJD supremo Laloo Yadav recently joined hands with â€œnouveau riche Bhumiharsâ€� and others at a function in Patna.

6,No party can give free power: CM,"KHAMMAM: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday reiterated that no party could give free power.

He was addressing Khammam TDP workers meeting. Naidu said neither he nor the TDP would make false promises like the Congress leaders. Naidu said the government and the party need not be on the defensive on this issue.

At the same time, he said the party workers should go to the people and explain the reason why free power was not possible. He said there was no consensus among the Congress leaders over free power.

Naidu said some Congress MLAs in informal talks told him that they were of the opinion that free power was not possible. Without naming anyone, he said faction leaders can never provide good governance to the people. Surprisingly, even films in the state are showing a trend of earning money from movies based on faction politics, he added. This must be the brain work of faction leaders, he commented. Naidu said that the government would expand agro-based industries in the state to help drought-hit farmers who have been affected by the drought.

Addressing a gathering at Wyra after inaugurating the Bodepudi Venkateswara Rao Sujala Sravanthi drinking water scheme, he said the government had drawn up a plan on crops.

7,Restive farmers make TDP nervous,"HYDERABAD: The growing disenchantment among Telangana and north coastal Andhra farmers against the government has been causing serious concern for the TDP.

According to senior party leaders, the leadership has called for detailed reports from the district units on the recent farmersâ€™ agitation against ban on black jaggery in Telangana.

Talking to The Times of India, a senior party leader said that the leadership has now decided to take up the issue at a high-level party meeting to be held soon. Party president N Chandrababu Naidu is understood to have asked some leaders to analyse the facts, based on information from district units, their individual assessment and submit a report. This report would be placed before the high-level meeting and necessary recommendations would be made to the government. Based on the recommendations, the government would act, he said.

The party had taken up damage control measures following the agitation. But the cause of concern was the new trend â€” spread of the stir to other parts of the state â€” that has emerged for the first time in the last six years. Initially, the party felt that the agitation was not spontaneous but stage-managed by the Congress. It had thought that by taking corrective measures, it would be able to contain the agitation.

But the feedback indicates that it was a disturbing trend. What worries the TDP is that farmers form a strong vote bank. The power reforms, non-availability of uninterrupted power other problems had resulted in the discontent.

13,Janu demands Aralam farm land for tribals,"KANNUR: The Adivasi Gotra Mahasabha has asked the State government to take steps to distribute the Central government owned 7,500-acre Aralam farm near here among adivasis and workers and threatened to start an intense agitation if the latter failed to do so.

The Aralam farm is near Iritty about 55 km from here.

""We want our own land and are prepared even to lay down our life for the cause"", Mahasabha president C K Janu told reporters here on Friday.

Accusing the Antony goverment of scuttling the ''united efforts'' by the adivasi communities, Janu said the State government decision to allocate the Aralam farm for a wildlife sanctury was a clear violation of the promises already made, especially when the Central government had agreed to transfer the land to the State government for Rs 108 crore to help rehabilitate the ''shelterless'' adivasi families.

She was equally critical of the CPM''s opposition for the rehabilitation of the adivasis in the Aralam farm and termed the previous LDF government''s stand as ''surprising'' as the party was in the forefront of the fight for the cause of the tribal communities.

The Aralam farm was set up after evacuting hundreds of adivasi families and against the promise of distribution of 1300 acres of land to 700 families only only 149 families were rehabilitated by allocating 1.10 acre per family, she claimed.

Janu warned that the adivasi community would vote against any political party which worked against their interests.

The opposition has decided to boycott the meeting.Meanwhile, Karnataka is expected to file another application in the court on Monday explaining why State could not fully implement the court's directive on releasing water. The application will be more or less a reiteration of earlier application.Law Minister D.B. Chandre Gowda told the Sunday Times of India the application would also touch upon Karnataka's requests to the Centre to convene the Cauvery River Authority meeting where the issue of modifying the quantum of water to be released from 0.8 tmcft could have been considered. The court had asked Karnataka to approach the CRA in the event of any difficulty in implementing the order.Krishna, who is returning to Bangalore on Sunday, held a meeting with legal experts to fine tune the application. It is learnt the legal advice has been to release some water to Tamil Nadu, which may help in softening the court's orders to be pronounced on Monday. ``The government has an open mind on the issue,'' sources said.Krishna, who has been in Delhi at all the court hearings on Cauvery, will not return to the capital. He will be present at the Bangalore IT.com event to be inaugurated by President Abdul Kalam.As a run-up to verdict on Monday, six more platoons of CRPF had been rushed to Mysore and Mandya districts to strengthen the existing forces. ``Prohibitory orders under section 144 CrPC have been clamped in and around Harangi, Hemavathi, KRS and Kabini dams,'' they added.Home minister Mallikarjun Kharge said there was no political uncertainty in the State. ``The Krishna-led government will continue in power.

15,Cong list ready for Assembly polls: Vaghela,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee president Shankersingh Vaghela on Saturday claimed that his partyâ€™s list for the forthcoming Assembly election was almost ready and would be finalised as soon as the dates for the elections were announced by the Election Commission.

Addressing a press conference after his return from the US, Vaghela said the list had been prepared in consultation with the district Congress leaders and even the central party leadership had deliberated on it.

Replying to a question on the possibility of some understanding with other opposition parties in the state on seat-sharing for the forthcoming election, Vaghela said senior Congress leader Hasmukh Patel had been authorised to talk to some of the like-minded opposition parties on the issue.

Vaghela denied that he had gone to the US with other Congress leaders to collect funds for the election. The purpose of the visit was to enlighten the NRIs and NRGs on the misuse of funds by the VHP and the BJP which they had been collecting over the years.

Even the funds collected from NRGs for â€œGokuliya gamâ€� scheme had not been properly utilised. He said, all the promises given by the BJP government in the state to provide facilities such as setting up of a guest house for NRGs visiting Gujarat and providing dual citizenship to NRIs by the Union government had remained on paper.

On the Godhra massacre of Kar Sevaks in the train, the BJP leader reiterated that he had raised suspicions whether the train compartment was burnt from inside or outside. Only an impartial inquiry would bring out the truth, he said.

16,Interpol's help sought to arrest criminals,"BAHRAICH: Nepal is no longer a safe haven for Indian criminals as the UP police have sought the help of their Nepalese counterparts as well as the Interpol to ensure their early arrest.

After committing crimes here criminals usually take shelter in the Himalayan Kingdom to escape arrest. As both the countries have a complicated process for the deportation of criminals, the Indian police have no option but to depend on their counterparts on the other side of the border to nab the wanted criminals.

The district police are fully aware that dozens of criminals in Bahraich and Srawasti have taken shelter in the neighbouring country but they cannot initiate any action against them.

Superintendent of Police (SP), Bahraich, Raja Srivastava said a list of the criminals hiding in Nepal had been prepared and their hideouts identified.

â€˜â€˜Now we have sought the Interpol''s assistance to arrest these criminals,'''' he said adding that from now onwards no criminal could escape arrest even after taking shelter in Nepal.

The SP said the matter would also be discussed at length at a meeting of senior police and administrative officials of both the countries.

Other security related issues would also be discussed at this meeting which would be organised soon. He, however, did not disclose the venue or date of the proposed meeting.
