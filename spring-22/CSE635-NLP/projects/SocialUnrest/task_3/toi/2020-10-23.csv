In Delhi, 13 people have died of dengue and 1,880 cases have been reported so far.

1,"SC stays firm, no crackers after 10 pm","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has refused to ease its ban on firecrackers beyond 10 pm on Diwali.

Sticking to an earlier Supreme Court ruling that festivities and noise can''t go together, a Bench of Justices R C Lahoti and Ashok Bhan recently rejected the plea of the Firecracker Manufacturers Association, which sought a relaxation in the court order so that Hindus in South India could burst crackers at 3 am while giving an oil bath to idols on Diwali day.

The Bench said cultural and religious considerations would not warrant a variation in the apex court''s earlier order on the issue.

Senior lawyer Jitender Sharma, who assisted the court in the noise pollution matter, also recalled another judgment which barred Muslims in Kolkata from using loudspeakers for early morning prayers.

Two years ago, the court had ruled that the religious freedom to burst crackers, play loud music and use loudspeakers could not be allowed if such activities affect the right of others to live in peace.

2,Effort to cut farm loan rate: FM,"MOHALI: Punjab Finance Minister Lal Singh laid the foundation stone of the camp office of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana, at Sector 70, Mohali, on Thursday.

The camp office which was earlier running from a rented accommodation will now move to Mohali after the building is completed.

Addressing those present at the ceremony, Lal Singh lauded the role of the PAU in ushering in the green revolution in Punjab and the country and also appreciated its efforts in producing hybrid seeds for higher yield. He said that with the laying of the buildingâ€™s foundation, a dream of 40 years has been fulfilled.

Talking to media after the ceremony, Lal Singh said that the government was trying to bring down the rate of interest of agricultural loans to nine or 10 per cent from the present 13 per cent. He said that the government could not reduce the rate of interest to as low as six per cent as the Reserve Bank of India had declared as ideal situation.

Regarding the recent hike in MLAsâ€™ allowance, Lal Singh defended the hike saying that it was still less than what the MLAs in Haryana were getting and equivalent to the allowances of Himachal MLAs. Answering a question on why the expenditure on the chief ministerâ€™s helicopter was not being reduced, he said that as compared to the expenditure incurred by the previous CM, Amarinder Singhâ€™s chopper bills were lot less.

""In fact, the cost of transport by helicopter works out cheaper than when the CM visits any place by road, he added.

Lal Singh avoided the question on the release of salaries to the government employees as Diwali is before the month end and in the previous years, in a similar situation, the employees were given salaries before Diwali.

He said that the government had recently released the Dearness Allowance of the employees and under the present financial condition it was not possible to give advance salaries.

CM skips opening Punjab CM Amarinder Singh was scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the PAU camp office building. He, however, could not make it and Punjab FM Lal Singh stood in for the CM. The organisers, PAU, had to make hasty arrangements as they were intimated of the change only few hours earlier.

The granite slab with the name of CM has been prepared and installed for uncovering and there was no time to bring a new one. So a paper strip with Lal Singhâ€™s name printed on it was pasted over CMâ€™s name. Even the local MLA, Bir Devinder Singh was also absent.

3,Jain protest against cruelty to pigs,"VADODARA: Jains here have protested the increase in incidents of cruelty meted out to pigs by their owners.

In memoranda to the police commissioner and the collector, the community has sought action against those who indulge in such acts. The owners allegedly nip the ears and tail and even use hot iron dye emboss to put identification mark on them.

The â€˜pig tradeâ€™ in the city is an organised one with each pig owner allowing its animals to breed and roam in a locality. The moment a pig strays into another ownerâ€™s territory, the former is told during their weekly meeting to pay a penalty â€” between Rs 50 and Rs 500 depending on the frequency at which the animals are caught. The gangs operate mainly in Kishanwadi, Gorwa, Gotri, Tarsali and Sayajigunj areas.

â€œWe had alerted the police about these gangs, but our pleas went in vain. So we decided to go as a community, thinking it might yield results,â€� says member of Mahavir Jiv-Daya Samiti Rajiv Shah.

â€œThe community abhors the cruelty shown to these animals. If the VMC is planning to spend Rs 2 crore to end cattle menace, they might have something lined up for the pigs, too,â€� adds Shah.

â€œEach full grown pig fetches Rs 800. Most of them are sold to buyers from Rajasthan and Maharashtra. To make sure that the numbers increases each area has a full grown male and a dozen female pigs,â€� says Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals founder Snehal Bhatt adding, â€œWe have registered nearly 150 police cases against 50-odd pig breeders in the past three years.â€�

4,"After officials, HC to line up ministers","PATNA: The Patna High Court on Thursday warned the government that if needed it might summon the entire state cabinet for non-compliance of the court orders.

â€œIf need be, the high court will summon the entire Bihar cabinet, including the chief minister, to explain why the high court orders remained non-complied with,â€� stated Justice R S Garg in his written order passed on Thursday while hearing a contempt of court matter.

â€œThe high court does not come under the chief minister or the state cabinet, but the chief minister or her cabinet certainly come under the high court,â€� he observed.

The high court, in its order passed in the year 2000, had directed the state government to prepare a panel for the appointment of a full-time director of the science and technology department. However, this was not done, and hence a show cause for contempt of court was served on the state government.

The secretary of the department concerned, who was present in person before the single bench presided over by Justice Garg, submitted that he has sent the file concerned with a panel to the chief secretary, who is learnt to have sent it to the state cabinet, where the matter is still pending.

The court took the matter seriously, saying that the state cabinet cannot sit over the matter for an indefinite period. If need be, he could summon the entire cabinet to court to reply to the show cause. He also stated that he would write to the law department too. The chief secretary was directed by the bench to be present in the court on November 7, and explain the position.

The bench also expressed its annoyance when he noticed that the secretary, science and technology department, had engaged a private lawyer, Sadanand Jha, despite the presence of the government counsel.

When the court inquired about it, the secretary said that as per state cabinet decision a secretary-rank officer can engage a private lawyer.

5,"BJP 'moneyed, fascist party', says Laloo","SASARAM: RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav on Thursday lashed out at the BJP and called it a ""moneyed, communal and fascist"" party. He asked people to unitedly fight for ousting the NDA government led by PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the Centre.

""The BJP is a moneyed party and if a probe is instituted, the truth will come out,"" Yadav said, addressing a public meeting here. He alleged that since the former UP CM and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader, Mayawati, strove for the uplift of Dalits, the communal and fascist BJP falsely implicated her in Taj heritage corridor case. Laloo also charged the Opposition parties, specially the BJP, with launching a sinister campaign to tarnish the image of Bihar''s RJD government. On the occasion, chief minister Rabri Devi announced that her government would appoint 40,000 primary teachers and 10,000 urdu teachers with 50 per cent seats reserved for women.

Earlier, she inaugurated two newly-constructed bridges here. On the occasion, in the huge Chitragupta ground here, the traders'' association of Dehri-on-Sone presented a crown of gold and a lathi of silver, respecitvely to chief minister and Laloo. The RJD workers also gifted Rs 21,000 collected by them. Among those present were former ministers Iliyas Hussain, Kanti Singh, MP Ramprasad Kushwaha and several MLAs.

The chief minister also inaugurated a community, marriage mandap and Abdul Qaiyum Ansari Smriti Bhavan at Dehri-on-Sone. They entailed an expenditure of Rs 76 lakh.

6,No bonus upsets govt employees,"MUMBAI: Discontent is brewing in Mantralaya and government offices across the state as a large section of the 19.67 lakh employees is upset over being denied the festival bonus for the third consecutive year.

A protest dharna was held outside the Pay and Accounts office, Bandra, on Thursday morning , where over 500 state employees shouted slogans against the state government.

Officials at Mantralaya also organised a gate meeting on Thursday afternoon to press their demand of bonus payment.

The state authorities, however, are in no mood to relent.

Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde maintains that the state cannot afford to pay bonus as it is faced with a drought situation.

""We will continue with our protest for our legitimate demands. This agitation will continue even after Divali and we will get them to sanction not only the bonus for this year but also the arrears for the last two years,"" said Gulab Pawar, joint secretary of the Maharashtra State Employees Federation.

Interestingly, Mr Shinde''s stand on bonus issue is not shared by many of the ministers in his cabinet.

In fact, some of the ministers suggested at a meeting of the state cabinet on Wednesday that the government should take a favourable decision as elections to the state assembly were scheduled for next year.

The finance department, which is headed by Jayant Patil, however, did not favour bonus payments to the state employees.

7,Redevelopment plan could further choke Girgaum,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde''s recent endorsement for skyscrapers has already been taken to heart by builders, who have gone on a construction rampage with the help of various government agencies.

In the bylanes of congested Girgaum, the state government''s vision to go vertical is slowly unveiling before the eyes of thousands of pedestrians and shocked local residents.

Bang opposite the Harkisondas Hospital and next to the Girgaum court, in a narrow lane called Parekh Street, a humongous 37-storey skyscraper is quickly coming up, literally a few feet from the footpath.

About 25 floors of this building, called Rushabh, have already been completed. It is part of a redevelopment scheme, in which about 300 tenants living in nine old buildings will be rehoused free of cost by the builder.

As a bonanza, he is availing of the incentive floor space index (FSI) to construct four huge residential towers, including Rushabh, to make profits.

Girgaum is an extremely high-density area, always crowded with people and with bumper-tobumper traffic on its narrow roads.

""The situation will only get worse,"" said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Satish Mathur, when told about the construction activity in the area.

Parekh Street is barely 25 feet wide. Any visitor will be surprised to see that there is virtually no open space surrounding Rushabh. In fact, it has been constructed dangerously close to another 21-storey building called Ram Krupa, built by the same developer as part of the redevelopment scheme.

The distance between the two buildings is barely 10 feet, although the developer Haresh Mehta claims the distance is 18 feet.

""We have received all clearances from the BMC as well as the fire brigade department,"" he said. Chief fire officer A.D. Jandwal said he was not aware of the case.

Interestingly, Ram Krupa building, which is already occupied, does not have a single parking slot for its residents.

Mr Mehta said he would provide parking space to Ram Krupa''s residents in Rushabh once the latter was completed. ""The first six floors of Rushabh are exclusively reserved for parking,"" Mr Mehta said.

The BMC has condoned 50 per cent of the compulsory open spaces for Rushabh, because such concessions are allowed by the government for rehousing tenants under its redevelopment scheme.

However, Mr Mehta contended that he will be surrendering about 17 to 20 feet so that the main Rajaram Mohan Roy Marg can be widened.

For now, work on Rushabh was stopped about two weeks ago after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued a notice to the developer under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act for carrying out construction beyond the commencement certificate the BMC had granted.

The developer puts the onus on the BMC''s estate department for not completing the process of amalgamating the various plots for the project. ""It is not our fault,"" Mr Mehta said.

Meanwhile, a Girgaum resident Yogesh Patel is planning a public interest litigation against the developer for alleged irregularities and flouting building norms.

The developer has brushed off this allegation, stating that Mr Patel has some vested interest in harassing him.

8,Congress seeks criminals away from polls,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Friday became the first political party to ask its aspirants for the forthcoming polls to file affidavits declaring their education qualification, assets and liabilities and criminal antecedents, if any, at the stage of applying for the nomination.

Only those applications that accompany these affidavits are being considered by the party''s pradesh election committees (PECs), so that the details could be verified by the Central Election Committee.

The PCCs of the states going to the polls -- Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Mizoram -- have been informed by party General Secretary, Oscar Fernandes.

While meeting in advance the Election Commission''s stipulation for the contestants, the measure should, theoretically at least, help the party to keep criminals out of its list.

In theory, filing of affidavits at the stage of nominations could make it easy for the applicant to prepare to face the Election Commission. However, it is possible for a candidate to file one set of details for the party and another for the Election Commission, party sources said.

Discounting this possibility, party spokesman Anand Sharma said that no constituency had a single aspirant and those competing could always report against a defaulting aspirant. In any case, ""the party has the mechanism to verify details,"" he said in response to query.

""Please do not go into the ifs and buts -- we shall never make a beginning at this rate,"" he observed when asked how foolproof the arrangement would be considering the large number of constituencies and aspirants.

Hordes of men and women aspiring for Congress nomination have converged on the national capital. They can be seen at 24, Akbar Road, the party headquarters, outside 10, Janpath, Congress President Sonia Gandhi''s residence and the state guest houses where the selection process is on.

With the new stipulation by the party, the serious ones among them are engaging lawyers right at the stage of applying for the nomination.
