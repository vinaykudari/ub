0,SC dishes out hawking rules,"MUMBAI: No hawking will be permitted on any street less than eight metres in width, the supreme court ruled on Tuesday while imposing a wide range of restrictions on hawking in Mumbai.

The court has banned cooking on roads, stipulated a fixed time for business and suggested penalising civic officials who repeatedly fail to take action against unauthorised hawkers.

The court has also directed the appointment of a threemember committee comprising a retired judge, a top civic official and a police official to supervise the implementation of the hawking zones.

The apex court has opened up 236 roads for hawking in the city. Some of the salient points of the order are: n No hawking within 150 metres of railway stations and 100 metres of religious places and educational institutions.

No hawking on foot over- bridges. However, hawkers can sell items required by devotees outside temples.

No cooking on streets, but hawkers can sell food already cooked and fruit juices.

Hawkers can operate only from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. n Hawkers have to comply with development control rules. Thus there can be no hawking in areas that are exclusively residential and where trading and commercial activity are prohibited. With regard to permissions given to hawkers:

The guidelines will not be applicable to hawkers who travel from place to place carrying goods with them.

The vending of electrical and electronic appliances will not be prohibited.

In areas other than the non-hawking zones, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) can grant licences to hawkers on the payment of a fee.

The court said that citizens can complain about hawkers in non-hawking areas. If the concerned ward officer takes no action, citizens may write to the court-appointed committee and the committee can ask police to remove the hawkers.

If a ward officer does not respond to such complaints more than thrice, it could be grounds for withholding his promotion. If he does not attend to more than six complaints, it could be grounds for termination of service.

Additional municipal commissioner Subrat Ratho admitted that it would bedifficult to implement the scheme, but added that it â€œwas not unimplementableâ€™â€™. While hawking zones can accommodate about 36,000 hawkers, the city has an estimated 2 lakh hawkers.

1,Bio-medical alarm after BMC shuts Sewri incinerator,"MUMBAI: With the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) bio-medical waste incinerator shut for over a month, city activists are concerned that highly toxic medical waste is being sent to dumping grounds without being treated.

The BMC had set up the facility in Sewri in 2000 to handle waste from all public and private hospitals that could not dispose of waste properly themselves. Medical wasteâ€”like syringes, body parts and glovesâ€”are considered hazardous since they can pass on infections and diseases.

However, the incinerator was found to be functioning poorly and polluting the surrounding environment. After making some effort to repair it, the BMC shut it in October and is now sending all waste to dumping grounds.

Activists say workers there could get infected. â€œIt is a matter of grave concern that the plant is closed. We have to find an alternate way to treat the waste,â€™â€™ admitted additional municipal commissioner S.J. Kunte.

However, officials with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said the BMC could send the waste to the incinerator at Taloja instead. â€œInstead, they asked us for permission to incinerate at the crematorium, which is not right,â€™â€™ said an official.

The MPCB has issued a show-cause notice to the BMC for shutting the incinerator without consulting it, as well as for the air pollution the incinerator was causing earlier.

2,"MLA, relatives clash, six injured","NEW DELHI: Six persons were hurt on Thursday afternoon in a clash between two groups in Khyala village in west Delhi. The incident was allegedly sparked off by a clash between Vishnu Garden Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Dayanand Chandela and his relative, Sudesh.

DCP (west) Satish Golcha said: ""Sudesh has alleged that Chandela and his cousin, Nawab, brandished swords, but it is yet to be verified."" The ownership of a jhuggi in Raghuvir Nagar appeared to be the bone of contention.

Sudesh, who works in the Keshopur vegetable market, had lent about Rs 50,000 on interest to a person called Sufi, said the police. When Sufi was unable to pay the debt, he let Sudesh occupy the jhuggi. Sudesh, in turn, had let out the premises.

On Thursday, the tenant reportedly approached Sudesh and complained that Chandela''s nephew, Manoj, had evicted him from the jhuggi. Apparently, Manoj had staked claim on the property, saying that Sufi had borrowed money from him, too.

In the afternoon, the two parties met to discuss the matter and soon a fight broke out. Sudesh''s father, Harphool, was reportedly injured in the incident.

He has been admitted in Deen Dayal Upadhyaya hospital. Two alleged associates of Chandela were also injured, but have been discharged.

3,Anandiben leads protest against Vijay Tendulkar,"AHMEDABAD: The ruling BJP on Thursday stepped up its protests against remarks made by well-known writer Vijay Tendulkar against Chief Minister Narendra Modi and branded him â€œanti-Gujaratiâ€�.

BJP leaders, who joined a protest meeting here, said Tendulkar joins the likes of Medha Patker, Arundhati Roy and Nafisa Ali â€œwho were bent upon maligning Gujarat and preventing its march towards progress and peace.â€� Education minister Anandiben Patel, a close confidant of Modi, led a group of party workers who staged a noisy demonstration against Tendulkar in the Satellite area of the city.

The demonstrators carried a placard with caricatures of Medha Patker and others and shouted slogans against them. Addressing party workers, Anandiben Patel asked partymen to be vigilant of elements who were out to disturb peace in the state. She alleged that Medha Patker and others were opposed to the development of Gujarat and had launched a campaign to malign the state and its people.

Referring to Tendulkarâ€™s statement (that if given a gun his first target would be Narendra Modi), she said a literary figure should have refrained from making such a remark. She said that if Tendulkar did not tender an apology for his utterances, â€œfive crore people of Gujarat would register their protest at every nook and corner in coming days.â€�

4,PUCL demands President’s rule,"HYDERABAD: The Peopleâ€™s Union of Civil Rights (PUCL) after touring the riot-hit Old city has demanded the imposition of Presidentâ€™s Rule in the state to restore peace in the area.

The PUCL leaders after along with the representatives of Hyderabad Ekta and Telangana Ikhya Vedika (TIV) on Wednesday said that the riots in which many lives were lost was masterminded by divisive forces.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Peopleâ€™s Union of Civil Rights state president and TIV leader Keshavrao Jadhav asked the government to take stern action against communal parties like the BJP and MIM.

All governments, except the N T Rama Rao, failed when it came to stopping communal riots in the city and punish even a single rioter. In the past 20 years, over 800 innocent people were killed,while two lakh people were displaced due to riots, Jadhav said.

All the recent communal riots, including those at Asif Nagar, Kishanbagh, Karwan and Mallepally, were pre-planned, he alleged.

The Peopleâ€™s Union of Civil Rights general secretary Jaya Vindhyala said that they would approach the National Human Rights Commission to probe into the human rights violation in the state by communal elements.

The Peopleâ€™s Union of Civil Rights would also file a public interest litigation in the High Court, he added.

The Peopleâ€™s Union of Civil Rights demanded a compensation of Rs five lakh to the family members of the deceased and Rs one lakh to those injured.

5,"BJP not for early LS polls, feels TDP","HYDERABAD: The central leadership of the BJP is not inclined to advance Lok Sabha polls as it would not work to its advantage. This was the surmise of Telugu Desam Party leaders who held a series of talks with BJP leaders in New Delhi at various levels in the past few days.

Speaking to The Times of India, the TDP leaders said the BJP leadership was not yet convinced that advancing Lok Sabha elections would help the party in any way.

It will not be possible to dissolve the Lok Sabha without going in for the vote-on-account budget, which means that the House cannot be dissolved before February. This would mean that elections would be held either towards the end of April or early May.

This would give a clear six months time to judge the style of functioning and performance of newly-elected governments in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Of the three, two states are led by women, who do not have much past administrative experience.

The question before the BJP leadership now is whether or not to take a risk at this juncture. At least for the present, the top leadership is against taking any risk, TDP leaders add.

Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has been in constant touch with national leaders including Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and even spoken to Prime Minister A B Vajpayee on the issue, sources said.

If elections are advanced, the government has to get the budget approved and complete other legal formalities before dissolving the House. According to TDP leaders, the vote in the three states was basically against the establishment and it may not be repeated or duplicated in other states to benefit the BJP.

The BJP is also not strong in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. At the same time, in the event of advancing the Lok Sabha polls, the state assembly polls would be clubbed with it and it would work out to the disadvantage of the ruling party locally.

The TDP is however confident that the elections to the state assembly would be held during early March and that there would be no constitutional crisis. The issue is also understood to have figured at the informal meeting Naidu had with senior MPs on Thursday morning. These leaders had returned from New Delhi on Wednesday night.

7,Authorities innovate on quota rules,"HYDERABAD: The reservation rule for the physically challenged has put the Hyderabad collectorate in a piquant situation.

Since they have to willy nilly implement the rule, the authorities have decided to go ahead and recruit visually challenged persons as watchmen.

Similarly, applications have been called from the visually challenged for posts of cooks, animal attenders, animal keepers, nursing orderlies and laboratory attenders.

The recruits may not be able to do justice to their jobs, but rules are rules, the authorities say. The collectorate intends to recruit 99 physically challenged persons to posts in various government departments.

Thirty of the posts are reserved for the visually-, hearing-, and orthopaedically challenged. There are some jobs reserved for the hearing-disabled which they may not be able to discharge. There is a driverâ€™s post reserved for the orthopaedically handicapped.

It has been made clear that the recruitment will be based on â€œmerit only.â€™â€™ Candidates have been asked to send in their applications by Dec. 27.

Asked how a visually handicapped person might do justice to the job of watchman, Hyderabad collector Rajeshwar Tiwari told The Times of India, â€œAfter recruitment, we will not insist that they do the jobs for which they are recruited. For convenienceâ€™s sake, we might ask them to do some other tasks which are possible for them.â€™â€™

Tiwari said past recruitments too were conducted in this manner. After appointment, the appointees were given tasks they could perform. He said rules clearly reserve some posts for a specified category of physically disability.

8,Abetment to suicide: DGP handed over case,"CHANDIGARH: Reacting to a complaint filed by the father of a Tarn Taran youth who allegedly committed suicide after being falsely implicated in a mobile phone theft case, the Punjab state human rights commission (PSHRC) on Thursday issued orders transferring the investigations from the government railway police (GRP), Amritsar, to the director general of police (DGP) of the commission.

The PSHRC has also asked the GRP not to file a challan in the case till the DGP submits his report by February 2, 2004. Vijay Kumar Mahajan, father of Saurav Mahajan (who had reportedly committed suicide on October 17, 2003, by jumping before the Pathankot-Amritsar passenger train at Katthunangal) had filed a complaint before the commission on Thursday alleging that the GRP, Amritsar, was not properly looking into the case and was favouring the accused who were tampering with the prosecution evidence.

According to Vijay K Mahajan, his son, Saurav, a student of law at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, had been falsely implicated in the theft of a Reliance mobile phone belonging to the son of a superintendent of police. â€˜â€˜The phone was being used by the owner and his friends, including Harminder Singh alias Mintoo. When the bill amount reached Rs 30,000, they asked my son to lend them money or else be ready to be implicated in a false case.

We informed head of the department M D Singh about it on October 13. Then Mintoo said that the threat was a joke and he had demanded Rs 2,500 only. When the HoD asked us to give a written complaint, Mintoo said that my son had sold him the mobile phone for Rs 400. The HoD did not listen to our requests. He asked Mintoo to give a written statement and forwarded both the statements to security officer S S Chhina,â€� said Vijay Mahajan. Mahajan alleged that his son was humiliated by Chhina so much that he sank into depression and committed suicide.

M D Singh, Mintoo and two others were booked by GRP, Tarn Taran, on October 17. Vijay Mahajan had earlier filed a complaint before PSHRC alleging that the inquiry in the case was not being done properly. Sandeep Gupta, an advocate and a witness in the case too alleged that his wife Charanjit Kaur, who is doing her LLM from GNDU had not been given her roll number by the HoD for the examinations.

9,Sleuths grill two arrested officers,"BANGALORE: In its effort to build a watertight case against the arrested jail staffers - P.N. Jayasimha, former jail superintendent of Parappana Agrahara Central Jail and his assistant Nanjappa - the Karnataka stamp paper investigation team (Stampit) extensively grilled them on Thursday.

The quizzing was to elicit information about stamp paper racket kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi''s activities in the jail and the extent of their nexus with him.

Jayasimha and Nanjappa were arrested by the Stampit on Tuesday night for their alleged complicity in the racket by allowing Telgi to operate the crime syndicate from within the premises of the jail.

The Stampit remained tightlipped about the outcome of the questioning. Jayasimha and Nanjappa will be in custody till December 16.

The Stampit headed by ADGP R. Srikumar reportedly questioned the arrested officers about monetary and material benefits allegedly received from Telgi. They have also been questioned about the involvement of their higher-ups, if any.

The arrested are expected to be subjected to a polygraphic test. The team is also looking into wealth amassed by the arrested.

A prisons staffer told The Times of India pleading anonymity that Telgi used to operate from Nanjappa''s chamber in the jail. ""He (Telgi) regularly had biryani in Najappa''s chamber in the company of his associates and used the government phone line.""

Nanjappa and Jayasimha had put up curtains in the visitors'' room of the jail to provide ""total privacy"" to Telgi and a few other ""rich"" prisoners when they met people calling on them, the staffer claimed.

After learning about Telgi''s nefarious activities in the jail between November 2001 and October 2002, the state government posted senior IPS officer M.D. Singh to the jail in October 2002 for a short period before he was made Bangalore police commissioner.

During that stint, he got those curtains removed and conducted an inquiry against Nanjappa, prison staffers said.

10,"'Uma is sincere, she will do very well'","BANGALORE/MANGALORE: The first thing that strikes the eye in Pejawar seer Visvesha Theertha''s chamber at Bangalore is his picture with his most famous disciple - Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti.

The mobile-sporting seer, who gave sanyasa deekshe (anointment as sanyasin) to Bharti in the early 1990s, is looking forward to a celebratory visit from his ""favourite"" disciple.

He told The Times of India: ""There is nothing wrong with sants, sadhus or sanyasins taking up the reins of administration, as long as they stick to dharma.""

Excerpts from an interview:

How did you and Uma meet?

She saw me at VHP programmes and chose me for her religious mentor, because she is a great Krishna devotee and I am a seer of the Krishna tradition. I anointed her in Amarakanta, the birthplace of river Narmada, in Madhya Pradesh.

Do you think a sanyasin can administer a state?

Anyone can be the head of administration, so why not a sadhu, sant or sanyasin? They are also citizens of the country and have the same rights as anyone else. Religion does not oppose it.

In earlier days, saint Vidyaranya intervened in politics and advised Hakka and Bukka to set up the Vijayanagara empire; saint Ramadas did the same thing for Shivaji. Uma has a soft heart. She is a sincere person, committed to the uplift of the downtrodden. I am sure she will do very well.

Aren''t religious heads supposed to be above politics?

As per North Indian tradition, the only restrictions are: follow rules, do daily pooja and limit the sex drive. If intentions are good and they want to bring about a positive political atmosphere, sadhus can be politicians.

If Uma is a sanyasin, what about her relationship with former BJP general secretary K.N. Govindacharya?

It was Govindacharya who proceeded too far, not my disciple. He was given sound advice and he backed off.

What is your advice to Uma in administration?

I will not interfere. But I think she should concentrate on basic necessities - food, water, roads - and meet the people''s aspirations. After this, as a spiritual person, she should also concentrate on education and health.

11,Govt development oriented: CM,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Thursday sought to shatter the perception that his budget was not development-oriented, while simultaneously spelling out the policies and priorities of his government.

He also did not miss out the opportunity to dispel the notion that the Samajwadi Party was inching towards the BJP. Replying to discussions held on the budget in the Vidhan Parishad, the CM touched on a host of topics and stated that his government had decided to give employment opportunities in primary schools to such BEd and BTC teachers who were still unemployed in the current fiscal year.

There are 46,000 such teachers. He also chose the occasion to announce that his government would deposit Rs 20,000 in the bank when a girl cleared the Class XII exam. This money would be utilised for her further studies or marriage if she so desired. Demolishing the argument that his budget was not development-oriented, the CM said it had to be borne in mind that it was only for a three-month period but even then care had been taken to ensure the welfare and uplift of farmers, the poor and the underpriviliged, in addition to other sections of society.

He said the State Development Council had been constituted with the intent of ensuring the development of the state and added industrialists of international repute were associated with it. He stressed that the govermnent had not spent any money till date on the council and said that he had personal relationships with industrialists. The CM said his government had decided to handover 24 sugar mills on lease to the private sector as most of them were incurring huge losses. Mulayam said the handing over would be done through tenders and would be thoroughly transparent.

He decried the filing of a PIL and said such measures only helped in retarding the development process. As regards his governmentâ€™s housing policy, the CM said good houses and good surroundings were a pre-requisite to attracting people. Elucidating about the new energy policy, the CM said his government intended electrifying every village by the next five years and if possible in the next three years itself. He said every MLC would be given the choice of selecting five villages which he wanted to be electrified.

Seeking to dispel the notion that his party was inching towards the BJP, Mulayam said distances between the two could be bridged to some extent only if the saffron party gave up the Ayodhya issue, its stand on abrogation of Article 370, as also its anti-minority stance.

12,Meet talks environment development,"PATNA: A two-day workshop to develop environmental reporting system and accompanying resourcepersons for the state, as part of the Union government''s scheme incorporated in the 10th five-year plan, began here on Thursday.

Inaugurating the workshop, held at Indira Gandhi Planetarium, minister for forest and environment Jagadanand Singh said that environmental concerns have emerged as major international concern, since one-sided stress on exploiting natural resorces to augment production had led to ecological imbalance. It has endangered many species and has also made even human survival difficult, he added.

Singh said that Bihar, too, has not remained untouched by the trend, and, therefore, a scientifically prepared report on Bihar''s environmental situation was necessary to plan future strategies for sustainable development.

The workshop has been organised by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) and Development Alternatives, New Delhi.

Bihar has delayed holding such a workshop to develop human resources and learn rudiments of environmental reporting, so as to prepare the state''s State of Environment (SoE) report.

Singh asked the participants to take up the project sincerely, since their''s is going to be the most important contribution to provide a reliable database for formulating sustainable development of the state. ""More so, for the fact that the state''s position should be reflected in the national report that is to be prepared next year,"" he added.

Earlier, Vijaya Laxmi, the manager of Development Alternatives, introducing the subject, said that her organisation had been identified as National Host Institution (NHI) for eight states, including Bihar, to set up the SoE reporting system in the state concerned, while BSPCB has been made the State Host Institution (SHI). The move would help make suitable judgments regarding the broad environmental consequences, she said.

Secretary for forest and environment S S Verma said that even though preparation of the SoE was a challenging task, it should be completed by 2004. The BSPCB chairman, J P Yadav, welcomed the guests, while the board''s member secretary, Indu Shekhar Singh, propopsed a vote of thanks.

13,More Indians using Net to deal with govt,"NEW DELHI: The digital web being woven for the last few years is netting more and more adult Indians. At least when it comes to dealing with the government.

A study conducted by international market information group Taylor Nelson Sofres says the number of Indians using the Internet to access government services or products available online has increased by nine per cent â€” from 31 per cent surfers in 2002 to 40 per cent in the last 12 months.

This is against a downturn in the use of e-government services worldwide, which has grown by 11 per cent over the past 12 months from 28 per cent to 31 per cent of adults who have accessed a government website in the past year. This is down from the 15 per cent growth rate recorded in the previous 12-month period till November 2002.

The annual study, conducted across 32 countries, suggests that strategies to increase e-government services are taking more time than anticipated for making an impact on netusers.

But India has bucked the trend, mainly due to increased availability of Net connections and a general stress on simplifying laws and using the medium to connect with the people.

The latest example of this being the facilities of filing tax returns online and netbanking. In India, the study was conducted among regular Internet users in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Pune.

Among netusers, incidence of government online is strongest among 35-44 year olds (46 per cent) and 25-34 year olds (45 per cent), although usage in all age brackets increased.

Men still remain more likely to use government online (46 per cent) than women (30 per cent) The study found that those aged 25-34 years and 35-44 years were more likely to use all government online services than the other age brackets.

Those with university or post-graduate qualifications were also more likely to be higher users.

14,Kerala Cong factions hint at merger before LS polls,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Congress Jacob and Pillai factions, both partners in the ruling UDF, on Thursday hinted at their merger before the Lok Sabha polls.

State water resources minister T M Jacob and transport minister R Balakrishna Pillai, who heads the factions, respectively, said at Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam district that the unity of Kerala Congress was the need of the hour.

""There will be some major change before Parliament elections. You can interpret it in different ways, including a possible merger,"" Jacob told reporters in Pillai''s presence.

""The rank and file want unity of Kerala Congress. We want that to happen during our lifetime,"" Pillai, a founder leader of Kerala Congress, said.

Jacob and Pillai were in Muvattupuzha to pay homage to the Kerala Congress founder K M George on his death anniversary.

The Jacob-Pillai duo had recently formed a ''core group'' within the UDF apparently to strengthen their bargaining power in the context of the crisis in UDF triggered by Congress factionalism. Together they have four MLAs.

One of the oldest regional parties in the country, Kerala Congress has undergone several splits and re-unions since its birth four decades back.

Now there are five Kerala Congress factions. Three of them are in the UDF and two in the LDF.

15,Mission 2004: BJP plans a friendly Muslim party,"NEW DELHI: Is the BJP providing covert backing to the establishment of a friendly ''Muslim'' party? The BJP says it is not, but a prominent Muslim cleric involved in the effort has told The Times of India that he has the ""active blessings"" of BJP leaders anxious to ""reach out to the minorities"".

According to Ajmer Sharif head Zainul Abedin Khan, who says he is in regular touch with BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and other top leaders, an announcement would be made in January.

""The PM will unveil a package for Muslims around the time he leaves for Islamabad for the Saarc summit. The formation of a political party with the BJP''s active blessing would be announced at the same time. The idea is to tell the international community that the BJP is not anti-Muslim. It proved itself in the recent assembly elections,"" Khan said.

The game plan is that the ''Muslim'' party - which will proclaim itself to be ''secular'' but will consist mainly of Muslim social-religious leaders - would actively work in more than 50 Muslim-dominated parliamentary constituencies countrywide and possible have ''friendly'' contests there. This is one of the many plans on the anvil as part of BJP''s Mission 2004, individuals involved with the effort say.

Khan says work on party formation has been going on for some time. ""I had met Venkaiah Naidu on November 12-13 in Delhi and to a large extent the idea has been worked upon. Now we need to tighten the nuts and bolts, which includes giving a name to the party,"" he says.

When contacted, Naidu denied there was any move to ""launch a political party"" of Muslims. As for the package for Muslims, Naidu said, ""The party is not aware since it does not interfere with government work.""

At the same time, he said, the BJP would be happy to get involved with ""anything which helps the citizens of the country"".

On his part, Khan says the plan is not to have a party of Muslims alone. ""Secular non-Muslims"" would very well be part of it, he says, but the ""party would watch the interests of minorities.""

The ''Muslim party'' plan is not without its critics. Mahmood Asad Madani, secretary, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a formation of maulvis close to Congress, terms the move a ""poison"" which would endanger the ""composite culture of the country forever.""

He also warns that the moment it becomes known that the party will help BJP, Muslims will run away from it.

The award this year was given to Childline project for pioneering developmental work by an NGO. <br /><br />Barefoot Volunteers and AWAKE are the other Indian organisations that have been commended for their work in the past. <br /><br />""We have contributed over $200 million in 130 countries affecting a billion children through Arab Gulf Programme for United Nations Development Organisations but there is a lot more to be done,"" Saud said.<br /></div> <div align=""left"" style=""position:relative; left: 0""><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" align=""left"" border=""1"" width=""71.9%""> <colgroup> <col width=""49.1%"" /> <col width=""50.4%"" /> </colgroup> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""100.0%"" colspan=""2"" rowspan=""1"" style="""" valign:="""" top;="""" background-color:="""" #99ccff;="""" ''=""""> <div class=""Normal""><span style="""" font-size:="""" 8pt;="""" font-weight:="""" bold;''="""">PEOPLE WHO READ THIS STORY ALSO READ...</span></div> </td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""49.1%"" colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"" style="""" valign:="""" top;="""" background-color:="""" #e3f1ff;="""" ''=""""> <div class=""Normal""><img src=""/photo/354504.cms"" alt=""/photo/354504.cms"" border=""0"" /><span style="""" font-size:="""" 8pt;''=""""> </span><a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/353090.cms"">Britain gets EU to tackle India</a></div> </td> <td width=""50.4%"" colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"" style="""" valign:="""" top;="""" background-color:="""" #e3f1ff;="""" ''=""""> <div class=""Normal""><#img src=""/photo/354504.cms"" alt=""/photo/354504.cms"" border=""0"" /><span style="""" font-size:="""" 8pt;''=""""> </span><a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/354391.cms"">Surgery ends Bhajji''s Aussie tour</a></div> </td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""49.1%"" colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"" style="""" valign:="""" top;="""" background-color:="""" #e3f1ff;="""" ''=""""> <div class=""Normal""><#img src=""/photo/354504.cms"" alt=""/photo/354504.cms"" border=""0"" /><span style="""" font-size:="""" 8pt;''=""""> </span><a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/352226.cms"">Urmila swept off by Lahori love</a></div> </td> <td width=""50.4%"" colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"" style="""" valign:="""" top;="""" background-color:="""" #e3f1ff;="""" ''=""""> <div class=""Normal""><#img src=""/photo/354504.cms"" alt=""/photo/354504.cms"" border=""0"" /><span style="""" font-size:="""" 8pt;''=""""> </span><a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/353245.cms"">Study abroad, get NRI status</a></div> </td> </tr> </table></div> <div class=""Normal""><br /></div> </div><div class=""section2""><div class=""Normal""><script language=""javascript"">doweshowbellyad=0; </script><br />The prince has spent a power-packed two days in meetings with personalities ranging from Bollywood celebrities to the country''s finance minister. <br /><br />""I enjoy Indian films.

18,Pak must discard terrorism as a state policy: Naidu,"NEW DELHI: Even as Indo-Pak peace intiatives are afoot, the BJP on Friday said there cannot be any improvement in the relations until Pakistan ""discards"" terrorism as its ""state policy"" and stop hailing terrorists operating in Kashmir as ""freedom fighters"".

""We are taking steps aiming better relations with Pakistan. But there has been no positive response. They are not ready to discard terrorism as a state policy and continue to hail terrorists in Kashmir as jehadis which is illogical and absurd,"" BJP President Venkaiah Naidu said here.

Addressing a convention ''Terrorism-A challenge to Humanity'' organised on the eve of second anniversary of terrorist attack on Parliament, Naidu termed Vajpayee government''s ""successful efforts"" to weed out terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir and the North-East as one of its ""biggest"" achievements.

""Pakistan''s designs have begun to flounder in Kashmir. The situation is also improving in North-East with talks being initiated with Naga groups and peace accord with the Bodos in Assam,"" he said at the convention hosted by Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) and World Youth Council Against Terrorism.

Earlier, Naidu paid homage to 12 security men who died thwarting the terrorist attack on Parliament.

He also honoured and handed over a cheque of Rs 32 lakhs to Sureshi Devi, mother of commando Surjan Singh, who is in coma after sustaining serious injuries while confronting terrorists during the Akshardham temple attack.

Former Punjab DGP K P S Gill and BJYM President G Kishan Reddy also spoke on the occasion.

19,‘Telgi scam flourished during Sena-BJP rule’,"MUMBAI: All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Vayalar Ravi, who is in charge of Maharashtra, said here on Thursday that state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Gopinath Munde and opposition leader Narayan Rane of the Shiv Sena owed an explanation to the nation as to why they did not arrest Abdul Karim Telgi when they were in office.

Mr Ravi told newspersons that the fake stamp paper scam, allegedly masterminded by Telgi, flourished during the Sena-BJP allianceâ€™s tenure.

â€œThe state incurred a revenue loss of hundreds of crores of rupees because of the sale of fake stamp papers and it is impossible to believe that the alliance government was not aware of this. Even before

Telgiâ€™s arrest by the Pune police, he was wanted in several cases. Why didnâ€™t the saffron government take action against him?â€™â€™

Mr Ravi asked. He noted that under the present Democratic Front (DF) government the scam was busted and action was being taken against the suspects.

The defeat of the Congress in the recent assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and other states had steeled the partyâ€™s resolve to work even harder in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections, he said, adding that the Congress lost the polls because it depended on â€œconventional methods of campaigningâ€™â€™.

â€œThe BJP campaigned at the grassroots level. At the micro level it projected the Hindutva agenda and at the macro level it dealt with issues of good governance,â€™â€™ he observed.

Mr Ravi said the rank and file of the Congress continued to repose its total faith in party president Sonia Gandhi. He said Ms Gandhiâ€™s popularity would be in evidence during the December 27 rally at Shivaji Park.

Apparently, the party has a budget of Rs 2.5 crore to make a success of the rally, which will be the first major public appearance of Ms Gandhi after the severe setback received by her in Madhya Pradesh and other states.

Mr Ravi is personally supervising the arrangements for the rally specially since the working of the city Congress has been severely affected because of intense factionalism.

Denying reports that former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh was likely to be appointed president of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC), he said there was no move to remove Ranjit Deshmukh as the MPCC president.

Referring to the demand for separate Vidarbha, he said the party high command was in no position to take a decision since there was no unanimity within the state Congress.

â€œWith the Sena vehemently opposing the division of the state, there could be a serious law and order problem if the government went ahead with the creation of a new state at this stage,â€™â€™ he observed. However, the AICC has decided to set up a regional â€œadvisory committeeâ€™â€™ for Vidarbha within the MPCC.
