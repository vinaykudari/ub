9,I was implicated due to political reasons: Virbhadra,"shimla: former himachal pradesh chief minister and congress legislative party (clp) leader virbhadra singh said on monday that the concealment of the cbi letter for ""political"" reasons, stating that prima facie no case could be made out against him, showed the malafide intentions of the dhumal government. talking to mediapersons, here, he said there was a bjp-led government at the centre and also in himachal, and despite that the cbi had worked freely and fairly, but for the chief minister to say that no case could be made out because of non-availability of certain documents was ""an after-thought and a face-saving device"". ""for three-and-a-half years, the government had utilised a taskforce for collecting facts and documents, and honest police and administrative officers were harassed, shuffled like a pack of cards and even denied promotions. a taskforce of cadre officers was created to entangle me in the cases. there are no missing documents. there is no case against me,"" he said. when the cbi team came to shimla, the government went on record to say that all documents had been made available, but now it was going back on its own statements. he said that not only was government machinery used to frame the so called chargesheet against him, but the forest and telecommunication mafia also contributed to the conspiracy, ""but all of them had to bite the dust"".those elements in the forest mafia against whom action was taken at the behest of late indira gandhi when he was the chief minister, were the ones who had retaliated against him, he added. the former chief minister said that he had been absolved by the lok ayukta, but even then ""these conspirators"" taking advantage of the political situation after the formation of the present government, had managed to get the cases sent to the cbi again. the clp leader said that this was the first government which had tried to implicate the leader of the opposition using its machinery. ""pressure was put not only on the state enforcement agencies, but also the cbi, to expedite the cases, through the prime minister and the home minister, and even now, after a clean chit by the cbi, pressure is being put on officers to implicate me,"" he alleged. asked as to why the state congress leadership had not reacted to the clean chit given to him,virbhadra said that the chief minister had gone on record saying that even some congressmen had put pressure to have the cases sent to the cbi.""however, 95 per cent of the congressmen of the state have stood by me,"" he added. he said that kewal ram chauhan, o p rattan and ranjit verma had signed the chargesheet and had been inducted into the congress.

11,Strategies for combating violence against women,"chandigarh: violence against women can be combated by pursuing long and short term strategies as it is the is result of deep-rooted prejudices against the fair sex and has social sanction. what compounds the problem is that the victims too condone the atrocities as normal social behaviour and rarely protest or revolt against unfair social practices. a study sponsored by the union ministry of health and family welfare and conducted by the institute of development and communication (idc) has analysed the problem of violence against women in punjab and have offered a strategy for combating it. the study has analysed in depth the problem of women being denied their rights and when she is subjected to various kinds of sexual abuses. the preference for male children, resulting in selective foeticide, utter neglect of girl child including denial of care and education and subsequently demands for dowry, harassment for not bearing a male child, wife beating, denial of their sexuality and even abandoning or murdering them are the first set of atrocities which women face. investigators stumbled over a case where a woman had undergone 14 abortions to have a male child and ultimately her husband had taken a second wife with little protest. eve teasing, molestation and rape are the other crimes against women widely prevalent in punjab but grossly under-reported because of various sociological reasons. though caste differentiations are not sharp in punjab and rarely are cases of atrocities on schedule castes reported the study revealed that perpetrators of sexual abuse, ie rape and molestation, come mainly from the upper castes while the majority of victims are from the lower castes. the study revealed that almost invariably it is the victim who is blamed for sexual assault because of social prejudices. she is blamed for the provocative dress, behaviour or even her looks in inviting sexual violence. the short term strategy for combating the problem involves legal literacy, women cells in the police and establishing a network grassroot organisations to create awareness on schemes for women. the strategy involves changes the social set up and creating a gender sensitive environment. the goal of the long term strategy is challenge womens' sexual submission and promote them as productive workers. for this an attitudinal change in male child preference, dowry, women's sexual submission including wife's subordination, challenging the hegemony of the groom's family over that of the bride and providing productive skills to women are some goals.

13,The political side of Narayanan's health,"new delhi: when an award-giving ceremony in the rashtrapati bhavan was postponed last week because of president narayanan's indisposition, it caused worry to party managers for more reasons than one. the state of his health seems to have a serious bearing on the next presidential election which is due in less than a year. still unnoticed by the media, the race has already begun with some of the aspirants quietly doing their ground work for the big battle. except rajendra prasad, no incumbent president has been given a second term. however, but for the impression that the 81-year-old narayanan's health is a cause for worry, some of the major political parties should have no problem in backing him for another term. ""our party appreciates president narayanan's performance, his defence of the constitution and the fact that he represents the country in the true sense,"" said cpi national executive member d raja. clearly, the left and other constituents of the people's front grouping would have agreed to consider him for a second term if there were no uneasy signals about his health. interestingly, though narayanan belongs to the congress, his more dedicated backers are in the people's front. asked about the thinking in his party, a senior congress leader said on condition of anonymity, ""we have not taken any decision because we are yet to receive an indication about narayanan's readiness."" sources close to the president say he has indeed not communicated any message about next year's contest. but the support from the left surely could not be entirely without some understanding. perhaps he wants the responsibility thrust upon him. however, his health bulletin might upset the calculations of his backers who would very much want the ruling nda to openly oppose him. a rashtrapati bhavan source described the cause for last week's programme postponement as his ""post-viral weakness"". but questions are being asked about his ability to continue with the ""rigour of formal occasions"" for another term, considering the fact that at the time of the next presidential election he will be 82. his term ends on july 24, 2002. from a long list of aspirants and probables, the two who have emerged as serious runners are vice-president krishna kant and senior congress leader karan singh. both seem to have taken the challenge in right earnest and have begun seeking support in not so open a manner.

14,Basmati's gone: Does anyone care for patent laws?,"chandigarh: our scientists are not even trained to put their discovery on a proper format, applying for a patent requires a lot of knowledge-intensive work. no, we are not prepared for these challenges, says a professor from the department of chemistry, panjab university. the department of laws, punjab university - doesn't one expect everyone here to have patenting laws at their fingertips, all ready to dole out advice to entrepreneurs and scientists for coping with the changing international laws on patenting and intellectual property rights (now that basmati has more or less been taken away from india)? the truth is, it has a paper on intellectual property rights as part of the syllabi, where patent law is one of the topics - and it was introduced almost 10 years back! ten years? keeping in mind the fierce competition for patents in various countries around the world, is there any need to update the syllabus? to that, v k bansal, chairman, department of laws, says, it is a new subject, you cannot have experts in a new subject. the subject is there, but if students do not opt for it, what can we do? keeping the importance of the subject in mind in the changing scenario, shouldn't the study on the subject be made compulsory ? says bansal, the llb syllabi is controlled by the bar council of india, the papers on law of intellectual property incorporate patent act, copyright act, and trade and merchandise marks act - the department has produced nine llm s on the subject. when asked if some of these lawyers were practicing patent laws, the response was, but, there are not enough number of cases to have specialised lawyers. anybody can do it, you just have to read a few papers. specialisation is needed only when there are too many cases... where is the need right now? other members of the law faculty disagree, what we are teaching is obsolete - the patent act of 1970, everything has changed since wto, what is the use of teaching these laws now? sure, missing the bus is part of our legacy and we don't seem to mind doing it again and again. satish kapoor of university business school says, the problem is, the knowledge on the subject is so peripheral, after the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights (trips) agreement, everything has changed. in our department we do not have a paper on international patent laws as such but we do touch upon trips, its impact on pharmaceuticals and drugs industry, a few case studies and geographical indicators. why talk of panjab university alone? india as a whole is not prepared for facing the international patent regime, simply because it is very knowledge-intensive. so, if one wants to get an innovation patented locally, how does one go about it, particularly in pharmaceutical and drug industry where things change fast? c l kaul, director niper says, in the last couple of years there has been some effort towards preparedness, compared to what the scenario was five years back, but the problem is that of implementation - it is not up to the mark. we still have to look for some attorneys from the us to go through that long-winding course, they file applications for us, we need a sea change in the level of awareness. how about filing a patent application locally, there are a dozen experts in delhi, but here, no, not a single one. or as dr manoj of university business school puts it, we are academically prepared, but implementation is in the hands of bureaucrats. the second amendment bill on patent act 1999 is still being studied by joint parliament committee, and indian innovators keep waiting for the change to take place at its own pace, slowly.

15,Peacock facing extinction,"palanpur: peacock, the splendidly magnificent bird has fascinated people since time immemorial. the folklore abounds in the vivid description of peacock. but for the presence of the bird it is difficult to think of indian gardens or a village house rooftop. its multihued feather and characteristic call lends enchantment to any environs. they bring peace and tranquillity to a weary soul. on the one hand the wonderful bird has inspired many a poet and artist and has carved for itself a pride position as our national bird and tragically, on the other its colourful appearance has been the cause of its disastrous end, too. during the past two decades, this wonder of the wild has been but vanishing gradually, as their number is diminishing steadily. in fact, this species is not common in north gujarat which once prided itself as the peacock's abode. how far could it remain safe considering the avarice of man? the increasing demand for its feathers, both for the decorative and religious purposes, is the main factor for this. may it be a disease, witchcraft or quack's way of treatment the peacocks feathers are indispensable. besides, the increasing use of pesticides in farming, particularly by tomato growers leads to mass killing of peacock, reveals a study by a mumbai-based organisation working for the protection and welfare of animals. the demand of mayur pankh and zhadu (hand fans and broom prepared from peacock feathers) for use in places of worship and the beautiful feathers that adorn the head of adivasi grooms and brides are some reasons that point to the peacock's popularity. recently some 15 peacocks were found dead in the hilly danta-ambaji region. it was attributed to consumption of a pesticide. recently this reporter found a vendor with scores of peacock brooms (zhadu) and hand fans tied in a cloth sheet. he was selling them for mere rs 30 a piece. neither the police nor forest officials were serious about such sale on the footpath. according to a forest official peacock killing is an offence but not selling its feathers. what an irony! only last thursday vaghri gopal and nena and vaghari ramesh nena fond of the tasty peacock meat were arrested at magarwada village in vadagam taluka on the charge of slaughtering two female peacocks. the police filed the case under clause 26 and 102 of forest act. the unauthorised killing of peacocks was on for a long time. said a schoolboy of the village who witnessed the peacock killings. the female peacock had four chicks and they are fluttering their wings for the motherly touch. ""we have been trying to feed them but they will not survive without their mother. they are too small to move without the fostering help of their mother"", he said. explaining the trapping tricks, boys who would follow the poachers said, ""usually the peacocks follow a track for breading and water accumulated area or tall and thick groves of the trees are the ideal places. but the poachers are at the strategic position in the night, use bright light to attract them. they trap the birds and slaughter them for their delicacy. a forest official of danta range said, ""over dozens of hundreds of the birds trapped are peacocks. a grown up peacock yields more than one and half kg of flesh, while its feathers are also a prized item. trapping a peacock is both easy and lucrative, as they can not fly long distance. catching a peacock is even easier than catching a hen. only a committed drive can save the fast vanishing beauty. or else, the peacock will be confined to verses and vases (i.e., paintings) and perhaps some books, remarked a veterinary scientist and bird lover v s rathore.

16,State govt warned against direct deals with pvt builders,"mumbai: the tinaikar committee report, which probed the functioning of the shivsahi punarvasan prakalp limited (sppl), a finance agency which gave huge loans to builders to undertake slum rehabilitation projects, has warned the state government not to deal directly with private builders and support them financially in future. ""financing private builders, several of whom are notorious for their manipulation with black-money, is an extremely risky business,"" it says. both the housing and urban development corporation (hudco) as also housing development finance corporation (hdfc), considered to be eminent housing finance institutions, had declined to take up the responsibility of financing the builders for this project. a leading credit-rating agency crisil also showed little interest in the project. ""this was adequate warning to sppl of the treacherous and slippery business it was about to enter,"" the report observes. the government has still not been able to recover rs 54 crores of the rs 73 crore the sppl disbursed as loans to builders to kickstart the grandiose but fledgling scheme of the former shiv sena-bjp government to rehouse 40 lakh slumdwellers free of cost. in return, the builders could undertake construction of saleable tenements. as many as 51 developers had their projects appraised and loans sanctioned in just two months of april and may of 1999. the congress-led democratic front government suspended further disbursement of loans by sppl after it came to power in october 1999. the tinaikar report observed that nobody in sppl, mainly bureaucrats, was qualified or had experience in this kind of financial business. besides, the compulsion of sppl to financially help developers so as to enable them to deliver 25,000 tenements in nine months, ""made its managing director reckless and ignore the normal standards of scrutiny of applicants to whom altogether rs 73 crores were disbursed as loan"". despite this recklessness, the sppl failed to achieve this target. the report describes the performance of sppl as very poor in general administrative efficiency, personal and financial management, and more particularly in advancing loans to developers. it pointed out that sppl only duplicated the activity of mhada in respect of construction of buildings under slum rehabilitation projects. ""the minister (suresh jain), as chairman of sppl probably wanted to inflate his ego and exhibit a better performance. he has miserably failed and so have the two managing directors who held the post between september 1998 to october 1999,"" it says. the tinaikar committee has recommended that ministers should withdraw from the board of directors of sppl and allow professionals and mhada staff to manage the company in order to recover the outstanding dues from the builders. it describes the scheme as repugnant because it allows the builder to pick up those slum pockets where slum rehabilitation is not the aim, but profitable sale of surplus land which is the only attractive compulsion. ""the government will have to pronounce its approach to slum rehabilitation programme, introduced since 1992, and intensified since 1995, in unambiguous terms,"" the report says. meanwhile, sources say that the democratic front government is still sitting on the tinaikar committee report although it was submitted to chief secretary v. ranganathan almost four weeks ago. ""the report is in public interest. yet the powers-that-be in mantralaya are treating it as highly confidential. the report has still not been placed before the cabinet,"" sources say. it is alleged that some influential builders have approached a congress minister with a proposal to financially help the party in return for a go-slow approach by the government on the damaging observations made in the report.

21,Jaswant lobbies for a TADA-like law,"new delhi: the government on tuesday again signalled it was reviving the idea of a tada-like law. external affairs and defence minister jaswant singh told parliament that more legislative teeth were needed to fight terrorism. ``i do believe that the government requires such a law,'' singh said during his reply to a rajya sabha debate on discussion on security threats. singh did not mention the terrorist and disruptive activities (prevention) act (tada) by name, but the context was clear. tada, criticised for being `draconian', had lapsed in 1995 and there has been no political consensus on its replacement. earlier this parliament session, home minister l k advani sought support for a new anti-terrorism law which made prosecution of militants easier. jaswant singh said there was a need to examine again whether the country required such legislation. he suggested that it was needed to combat legally the threats india faced. singh's long reply covered a range of security issues that had come up during the discussion: including arms purchases, cross-border terrorism, role of madrasas. he said by the middle of next year, the government would have implemented 300 of the 340 recommendations made by the group of ministers on security. the minister rejected suggestions that the defence ministry suffered because it only had in him a `part-time' minister. he had assumed the additional charge when george fernandes stepped down after tehelka. singh said despite the enquiries now on into the functioning of the defence ministry -- including the justice venkataswami probe into tehelka revelations -- no important decision had been held up even by 24 hours. though singh was replying to issues raised during the debate, he also seemed to be contradicting the former defence minister's recent remarks. emerging from a national democratic alliance meeting on monday, george fernandes had said there was concern that defence purchase decisions were getting delayed because some important ministry files were now in the possession of the venkataswami commission. singh said the proposal for a joint strategic forces command was now about to be implemented: its role had been defined and the details worked out. the command is expected to be in charge of india's nuclear deterrent. by september-end, a joint andaman and nicobar islands command will also be established. it will have elements of army, navy, air force and coast guard. in the beginning, the command will be headed by an officer from the navy. later, suitable officers from any service could be asked to head it. singh approved of a suggestion that the government should hold a meeting with all muslim mps and share with them reports about the role of madrasas in encouraging militancy. opposition mps expressed concern about the `negative' portrayal of madrasas in the group of minister's report.

""this was decided by the chief minister keshubhai patel after we discussed the issue with him at a meeting in gandhinagar"", bjp vice-president madan lal khurana, who is in-charge of the party affairs in the state, told reporters here sunday. he alleged that some ""islamic fundamentalist organisations had deliberately made an issue out of non-issue to spark off communal clashes in sensitive areas of the city."" an unknown organisation gave a call for a bandh over beating up of some muslim hawkers near cadila bridge about 20 days ago even as the ahmedabad muslim traders' mandal wrote to the police commissioner that it was not supporting the strike call and had nothing to do with it, khurana said. the sponsors of the bandh call were unknown and had printed inflammatory pamphlets bearing no name of the publisher and printers, he said adding that one person died in police firing, three shops were burnt in kalupur area and a shed of a temple in mirzapur area was damaged in the violence. meanwhile, the indefinite curfew clamped in dariapur locality following saturday's disturbances, was relaxed between 4 pm and 6 pm sunday for women and children due to improvement in situation and to enable people to buy essential commodities. the bjp leader said 30 people have been arrested for the violence that rocked the city areas for two days since friday. khurana, however, evaded questions regarding when the probe would be completed, whether the ib could be trusted with the job and why no action has been taken by the bjp government against police officials who were responsible for death of seven hindus in police firing during a religious procession in surat a year back. about dissidence in the ruling bjp and party mlas engaging in arguments with ministers on the floor of the assembly, he said there was no dissidence in the party and mlas were duty bound to raise the issues concerning their constituency in the house and there was nothing wrong with that. asked what he had to say about reports regarding rural housing minister jaspal singh meeting samajwadi party leader mulayam singh and his plan to quit the bjp, khurana said he was not aware of this. ""jaspal singh has met me and had related his problems to me,"" the bjp vice president said, refusing to divulge the issues raised by singh. he said the core group for the state unit of bjp would be announced after septemeber 20 by-elections and claimed that his party would win both the sabarmati assembly and sabarkantha parliamentary seats in the by-poll.

24,Bellary bandh over Tunga waters total,"bellary: the bellary bandh organised by the members of the tungabhadra jalasadhana samithi on tuesday, was peaceful and total. in the morning the bandh received mixed response, and became total later in the day. all commercial establishments on the main street remained closed, including cowl bazaar. the bandh was called by tungabhadra jalasadhana samithi against the government's decision to divert 11 tmcft of water to the comprehensive revised singatalur lift irrigation project from tungabhadra reservoir. this is the second bandh in the district as part of a chain of agitations. last saturday, kampli town had called a bandh on the same issue which was total and peaceful. as a precautionary measure, schools and colleges remained closed for the day. the attendance in government offices was thin and most offices did not function along the route that the agitators were taking a protest rally. in bellary, the protest rally which started from gandhi bhavan where hundreds of farmers gathered from surrounding villages, went round the main streets before it culminated at the deputy commissioner's office where the leaders handed over a memorandum to chief minister s m krishna through the dc jawaid akhtar. there was some tension between the dc and the samithi members, when the jls president darur pullaiah pointed out to the dc that it was not becoming to conduct the zilla panchayat meeting when a bandh was called. pullaiah demanded that the meeting be called off immediately. the dc said he was helpless and it would be better to make the demand at the venue of the meeting with zp chairman venkatrao ghorpade. the agitators moved to the zp premises and succeeded in disrupting the meeting. cinema halls announced closure of the day shows. the rtc and government vehicles stayed off the roads. however, private vehicles and autos plied as usual. the work in commercial banks, lic offices and other state and central government offices did not function. the agitators main demand was that utilisation of karnataka's share under the tungabhadra project should be retained at 139 tmcft itself. immediate action should be taken to construct balancing reservoirs to store unutilised water from karnataka's share at about 30 tmcft, which was going as surplus water to andhra pradesh. the water stored should be supplied to tungabhadra ayacut to stabilise the suffering ayacut which is about 20 lakh acres.

25,Change of mindset needed for development: Gogoi,"guwahati: assam chief minister tarun gogoi on tuesday called upon the people of the state and the bureaucracy to go for change of mindset for bringing around development and removing unemployment from the state. gogoi addressing the party general body meeting at the district library on tuesday to mark '100 days of gogoi ministry' said that all the previous government had been giving wrong thrust on only peace while ignoring the two most important problems of economic backwardness and massive unemployment in the state. he said that there was no doubt that the state was suffering from a serious problem of insurgency, but there were states like punjab and andhra pradesh where insurgency was a much more serious problem. however, economic development never took a back seat in these states and this was possible only due to the people's mindset. he said that the effort of the state government was to improve the rural economy also so that people in the rural areas can have higher purchasing power, which ultimately leads to economic upsurge in the state and thus help the process of industrialisation. the chief minister said that though 100 days was a short time for any government, they had been able to improve the law and order situation in the state, which was evident from large attendance at the independence day functions all over the state despite a strike call given by the militants on that day. gogoi might try to give a rosy picture to his party men, but the infighting is now an open secret and these 100 days have not been smooth sailing for him. though after the swearing-in ceremony gogoi had stated that the next phase of expansion of his ministry would take place within a month, so far he has failed to do that because of his partymen's demands to include their representatives in the council of ministers. even the present set of ministers are not very happy. while senior partymen had to be content with minor portfolios, greenhorns had been allocated several important portfolios. the first major public programme of the gogoi ministry also spelt doom for him as the programme marked to begin the 'peace and development week' in the state was marred by hundreds of cases of food poisoning. the victims were mostly children, who had eaten grams distributed by the authorities. assam's financial condition has also not been very good. though the state government has able to pay salaries to its employees, most of the development work has been adversely affected due to lack of funds. gogoi will have to do more than give speeches and at the same time ask his council of ministers to give development activities top priority.

28,Governor keeps govt in good humour,"lucknow: unlike his predecessors, suraj bhan and romesh bhandari who remained in the thick of controversies for one reason or the other, up governor vishnu kant shastri has become controversial for his low-key style of functioning. interestingly, both suraj and romesh had defended the autonomy of universities. they refused to give assent to a controversial amendment of the up state universities act by the state legislature, which envisaged that the chancellor should be bound by the advice of the state government in appointing interim or regular vice-chancellors and nominating members of executive councils. but shastri has chosen to toe the line of the government and allowed it to fiddle with the already fragile autonomy of the universities. this is particularly evident by his silence on the government order (go) dated august 4. the go seeking to increase undergraduate seats by 10 to 15 per cent in universities is ultra vires of the powers of the government. as a section of teachers puts it: ""the act reserves this authority to the statutory bodies of the university and makes no provision for the state government's interference in this regard."" this being an election year, more such ""illegal"" orders are expected from the government to shore up its popularity, observe teachers. the apprehension grows stronger in view of the governor's low-key approach and his ideological sympathy with the ruling bjp. the governor defends himself by saying that he is only a pro-active and not over-active governor. what has stirred a hornet's nest is the controversy over the rotation of headship in state universities for which the government issued a statutory go on july 24. although the allahabad high court has stayed its operation with retrospective effect, the proposal which vests the vice-chancellor with a power to appoint the head of a department for a term of three years, has several internal contradictions. in fact, the go is contrary to the recommendations of the up singh committee, according to which the rotation of headship shall be strictly in the order of seniority and a lecturer shall be the head, if there are no professors and readers in the department. most teachers feel that the go should have been modelled on the lines of the delhi university and the jawaharlal nehru university provisions. the silence on the issue by the governor has caused dismay to the teaching community. the raj bhawan has also come under controversy for some of its questionable orders. notable in this context is the governor's order to renominate professor mata din as member of the executive council of the allahabad university despite a highly damaging report against his conduct by the vice-chancellor. similarly, one vijay kumar sinha, a small-time politician, had represented against five teachers of the allahabad university to the chancellor under section 68 of the act. although his representation was dismissed in november 2000 by the then governor suraj bhan, these orders were held back for nine months and issued only on august 8, 2001. thus, by delaying these orders sinha was allowed to harass the teachers for no reason.

29,BJP chief rules out snapping ties with DMK,"meerut: bjp president jana krishnamurthy on tuesday categorically ruled out that the bjp-led national democratic alliance was contemplating breaking its alliance with the dmk to pave the way for entering into an alliance with the aiadmk. speaking to reporters here, krishnamurthy said the dmk was an important constituent of the ruling coalition. ""the question of breaking the alliance with it does not arise."" referring to the re-entry of the trinamul congress into the nda, the bjp chief made it clear that the nda would soon evolve certain norms for the re-entry of a party once it had left it. ""unless some norms are formulated, it cannot be called a meaningful and disciplined ruling coalition,"" he added. he said the norms would be formulated by a sub-committee headed by george fernandes. the sub-committee would submit its report within a week. referring to prime minister atal behari vajpayee's statement on resolving the ayodhya issue, krishnamurthy said he did not know how the ayodhya issue would be resolved. he also expressed his ignorance about the groups which the centre was contacting to resolve the ayodhya issue. krishnamurti, who arrived here accompanied by bjp state chief kalraj mishra, also made it clear that the demand for separate states of harit pradesh and telengana were not on the nda's agenda. hence, the question of their creation did not arise at least till 2004. responding to a question relating to the use of sex workers by the tehelka staff, the bjp chief said the nda allies were yet to discuss on how the fir against them would be lodged. he also regretted that the congress had not come out openly to speak against the members of the portal which, he said, had tarnished the image of journalists. the bjp president also addressed a meeting of party workers. his visit was aimed at gauge the mood of the voters in view of the coming assembly polls in up.

""i will handle the media and get the details of the reporter and teachers facilitating the publication of such damaging facts,"" a visibly irked principal pronounced in the presence of a over 100 teachers. the principal, the teachers alleged, did not recognise any association of teachers meant to ventilate their grievances, primarily because he was not consulted in its formation. the institution is currently in the throes of a controversy involving a cotorie close to the acting principal. even teachers with 30 years of service lack provident fund account number. apart from allegations of admission rackets being operated by teachers turned henchmen, students belonging to affluent families are also being forced to take tutions to insure 'good grades,' laundering of school funds on pretext of repair, renovation and construction of building etc. one of the teachers has already lost hopes of recovering her life's savings: ""the principal and his henchmen appear to be after our lives. should we keep quiet and follow their dictats."" the principal has been officiating at the post for over four years, besides being a full time principal of the boys high school, also a minority run institution. inspite of repeated attempts, principal c v innes could not be contacted for his version

32,SP's Vyapar Sabha chief quits party,"lucknow: a well-known trader, radheshyam gupta, who headed the samajwadi party's vyapar sabha, quit his party on tuesday and decided not to join any political party till he was convinced about the bonafides of the political outfit. talking to reporters, gupta said that mulayam singh yadav's decision to induct banwari lal kanchal into sp was against the interests of traders. he said kanchal had always played tricks with traders and added that by inducting kanchal in his party, yadav had antagonised the entire trader community. gupta accused the samajwadi party leader of playing to the gallery in the name of inducting traders in his outfit. he asserted that while no trader was actually joining sp, an impression was being created that the trader community was gravitating towards it. gupta said he was pained at leaving mulayam singh yadav. he said he would return to sp, if kanchal was expelled from the party. bjp mlc ajit singh and yashwant singh were also present at the press conference.

33,"UP Congress rules out alliance with SP, BSP","aligarh: the two-day brainstorming session of up congress party leaders at vrindavan, which concluded on sunday evening, has finally ""sealed"" all prospects of any possible congress tie-up with both the samajwadi party (sp) and the bahujan samaj party (bsp). explaining the rationale behind this move, senior congress leaders and former up congress chief salman khurshed said that the congress had ""no ideological compability with the sp"". salman, who has always harboured antagonism against the sp, said: ""this party has always promoted a casteist line in politics. we, however, do not believe in fracturing society."" salman said that on the other hand, the congress party shared the bsp's objective of lifting the downtrodden sections of society, ""we cannot have any truck with them because of their flawed methods"". the congress' decision to finally rule out any electoral pact with the sp may not have any immediate fall out because in any case there was never any serious attempt to forge such an alliance in up, but the ramifications of this decision could possibly manifest themselves on the national scene after the up elections, when there could be a possibility of a realignment of political forces at the centre. the up congress also decided that from september 10, the party would launch a major ``public awareness drive'' in the state culminating in a public rally at lucknow on september 20. according to salman, there is now a growing awareness in the party for the urgent need of evolving ""new instruments of social justice"". he said that caste-based reservations in government jobs were losing their relevance in the new economy of the country as job opportunities in this sector are drying up. ""if we genuinely wish to uplift the weaker sections of society, then we will have to think beyond the quota system."" salman said that most party leaders, who attended the vrindavan conclave, were of the opinion that ``no major changes should be made in the party organisation till the state assembly elections are over''.
