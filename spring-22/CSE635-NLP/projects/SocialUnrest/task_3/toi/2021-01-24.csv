Bhinder was said to be busy in Delhi where she is pushing for her loyalist CLP members for a possible berth in the cabinet expansion by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.

Pritam shared the dais with education minister Khushal Behal, DCC president Gurbachan Singh Babehali, PPCC member and DCC vice-president Chander Pal Singh, another kin of Bhinder.

1,75 per cent turnout in Gunnaur by-election,"LUCKNOW: Even as polling for the Gunnaur Vidhan Sabha seat in Badaun district went off peacefully, altogether 75 per cent of the electorate exercised their franchise in the by-poll for which chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is also contesting.

The polling which began on a dull note picked up later in the day on Saturday. While according to reports by noon, only 30 per cent of the voters had turned up to cast their votes, the crowd started trickling in and by 4 pm, this went up to 61 per cent. However, the polling was most brisk during the closing hours taking the percentage to 75 per cent, said an official.

At some of the polling stations, supporters of the different candidates clashed with each other, but they were controlled by the police on duty. The polling for the seat went uninterrupted despite the skirmishes reported from some parts of the constituency. Counting for the seat will be on January 27, said chief electoral officer Vijay Sharma. He said that the EC had arranged sufficient number of electronic voting machines (EVMs) for the polling.

On possibility of re-polling, the CEO said that as of now there had been no such decision but a final decision would be taken only after getting reports from the returning officer.

2,Chemists' protest continues,"LUCKNOW: Drug store owners may have a ''pill for every ill'' but with no clear indications from the health department regarding sale of food supplements their protests are taking on a feverish pitch.

Their demands are that the government must curtail sale of food supplements that are being produced on Rs 10 licences without laboratory tests. President, Lucknow Chemist Association, Giriraj Rastogi said that we have requested that the health department cancel the licence of manufacturers whose products are of inferior and sub-standard quality and, hence, are a health hazard. ""We will also urge government hospital doctors and private physicians not to recommend these supplements and strict action should be taken if they prescribe sub-standard food supplements."" Companies that can assure stringent quality measures should be allowed to sell their products at the drug stores.

Local manufacturers should be obliged to follow WHO GMP standards before they can sell their health products in the market. Chemist have, however, given an assurance that whichever drugs or food supplements that the government identifies as sub-standard/spurious will not be sold at their shops. However, chemists are not prepared to follow the norms regarding the hiring of a pharmacist to man their drug stores.

Meanwhile, manufacturers of food supplements and Ayurvedic medicines with their backs against the walls have decided that if the minister does not give the green signal for sale of food supplements at medical stores, their last recourse will be to file a PIL against this decision. According to Kirti Kumar, president of the Association of the Nutritional Supplements and Ayurvedic Manufacturers, based on the experience of similar cases in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu wherein the drug controllers had banned sale of food supplements at drug stores and the court had ruled in favour of the manufacturers, ""we have strong and legitimate background to contest this order.""

3,State govt will fall in March-April: Katiyar,"ALLAHABAD: An upbeat state president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Vinay Katiyar said here on Saturday the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in the state would fall by the last week of March or the first week of April.

""The BJP need not do anything for bringing down the ''inept'' Mulayam government in the state. It would fall on its own. At the most, we would give a small nudge when the time comes and clap for the outcome,"" he said.

Talking to reporters in his camp a little before immersion of Kushabhau Thakre''s ashes, Katiyar said all formalities regarding the return of Kalyan Singh to the BJP were complete.

""He is likely to join the party in the next two or three days,"" he said.

He criticised the Mulayam government for ""failure on all fronts"". ""The law and order situation is in a mess. The lives and limbs of the common people are endangered,"" he claimed.

""The party stands to gain from the return of Kalyan, while for Kalyan it would be like returning to his ''janani, janmabhoomi'' (mother and motherland). BJP is the party which had nurtured Kalyan,"" he said.

Elaborating his point, he said about 18 months back he had predicted the pattern. ""A pre-1991 situation would be created in the state. The Yadav government would fall, paving the way for ''Ram rajya'', that is BJP rule. It is now happening,"" he claimed.

On the Ayodhya issue, he said Ram mandir was not a political issue. ""After December 6, 1992, the situation has changed. It is a ''sanatan'' place now. Ram temple is already there. No one can hinder or stop the construction of a ''grand temple'' for Ram Lala,"" Katiyar said.

Meanwhile, local BJP office-bearers said the state-wide dharna against Mulayam government was postponed in Allahabad and Kaushambi due to immersion of Thakre''s ashes here on Saturday.

4,Bhuria picks on govt for ignoring TAC,"AHMEBADAD: The Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, set up under Article 339 (1) of the Constitution, has pointed out in its report that Gujarat has been ignoring state-level Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) while making policy decision.

Commission chairman Dilip Singh Bhuria,who was on a visit to the state between January 18 and 24, took note of the fact that despite setting up of the TAC under constitutional requirement, it has not been paid due importance by the state.

It pointed out that members of the TAC have not been meeting frequently as they are not being consulted for making any policy decision as far as formulating or amending legislations in their application to scheduled areas are concerned.

He pointed out that reports being submitted by the TAC are of routine nature and do not touch thrust points effecting the interest of scheduled tribes living in scheduled areas.

Bhuria, along with his team comprising Chokila Iyer (vice chairperson), member SK Kaul, member convener BD Damore, members KF Valvi and PK Patel and expert PD Gulati, had been looking into constitutional safeguards provided for scheduled tribes with special reference to the fifth and sixth schedules of the Constitution.

The commission will submit a report to the President on the working of these safeguards and adumbrate a vision for the future and formulate an outline for a viable comprehensive tribal policy.

The commission team which visited 10 tribal districts of the state also took into account the health, education and social conditions of people and felt that tribals were not getting their due share of funds as required for their development.

5,Vote bank politics kicks off in Surat,"SURAT: With the general elections just a few months away, politics of vote bank seem to have been kicked off in the city of diamonds. And the battlefield for now are the slums.

To start with, the city unit of the Congress plans to firmly protest any move to relocate dwellers living in over 309 slums and slum-like pockets in the city. It instead wants to exploit a scheme of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) to make the city a zero slum one.

The SMC on its part, has initiated relocation of slums in other parts of the city. Under the schemes, land for construction of dwelling units by the persons concerned would be made available by the SMC or flats will be built under the Eonomically Weaker Section (EWS) scheme by the corpoartion.

The civic body plans to offer easy terms and conditions to relocated slum dwellers, said SMC officials.

In fact, in the draft budget for the year 2004-2005, a special provision has also been made for adequate budgetary allocation to build EWS flats in the city for slum dwellers, said SMC deputy commissioner K C Mehta.

With about 40 per cent of 30 lakh population living in slums and slum-like pockets, stress in the coming financial year would be on constructing houses under the EWS scheme, he said.

However, the move is being viewed as an attempt to dilute vote bank of the Congress, as most of the slums are reportedly bastions of the Congress, said Kadir Pirazda, vice president, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC).

About 12 lakhs people live in slums were a sizable number in terms of votes and the move to relocate them would have bearing on the results of general polls. Relocation would not be along with revision in electoral rolls and displaced voters would not come back to their original polling booths to cast their votes, Pirzada told TNN.

Keeping this in mind, the corporationâ€™s move to shift the slum dwellers would be resisted by all means, said opposition leader in SMC Babu Raika.

In Bapu Nagar and Subhas Nagar near Adajan, the total population is around 80,000 and once shifted, the Congress will definitely suffer a substantial loss in terms of votes, Pirzada added.

In a rally on Wednesday, over 5,000 slum dwellers led by the local Congress leaders resolved to resist any such move by the corporation, as they termed it a disadvantage to poll prospects, said city unit Congress president Sunil Bhukanwala here.

In fact, the attempts should be to construct EWS houses at places where these slums presently stand so there is no displacement, said Raika.

Moreover, the move to relocate slums would also affect many in terms of livelihod as many are having jobs located in nearby areas, Pirzada said.

For the time being, dwellers in slums like Bapu Nagar, Subhas Nagar, Limbayat, Bhimnagar, Iqbal Nagar and many others have been told by the local Congress unit leaders not to entertain any official from the civic agency for the purpose of relocation, said Pirzada.

7,Buddha flays arbitrary arrest of state doctors,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government is working on a legislation that would protect doctors from being arrested on negligence charge, unless a medical board established their guilt.

Speaking at a function organised by the state branch of Indian Medical Association in Kolkata, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee criticised the attacks on doctors, saying, ""We cannot allow such things to happen. Mistakes do occur. At times, allegations of negligence are genuine. But police are in no position to judge,"" he said.

The state legal department was framing a legislation that would prevent the police from taking recourse to provisions of the Indian Penal Code while booking doctors for criminal negligence.

The police will be allowed to step in only after a nod from a high-powered medical committee comprising health department officials, representatives of IMA and non-professionals.

""Mob mentality cannot be encouraged. Whenever there is an accident, people resort to arson even if the pedestrian is at fault. If doctors are attacked, they will refuse to treat serious patients,"" Bhattacharjee said, iterating that he was trying to set things right by ensuring that the police did not overstep their jurisdiction.

The CM also assured doctors that his government would not try to impose regulations without arriving at a consensus.

In a veiled criticism of health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and his department for drafting a Clinical Establishment Act that was not in sync with reality, Bhattacharjee said, ""We cannot impose foreign requirements on home soil.""

Though changes have already been introduced into the Act following objections from the medical fraternity, the CM said he had asked Mishra to sit with IMA again to sort out the remaining differences.

The IMA is opposed to re-registration of doctors, an issue that the minister remains adamant on.

Offering a peek into the fresh health policy being prepared by the government, Bhattacharjee said stress would be laid on diseases like cancer, AIDS, diabetes and neurology.

Though 65,000 new cancer cases are recorded in the state each year, facilities are inadequate. In AIDS, the state has been shifted from the low-profile bracket to a high-incidence one. Diabetes remains a serious lifestyle disease while neurology facilities need extensive modernisation.

Though the CM was candid to admit that there were loopholes in the healthcare system in the state, he said the state was trying to promote centres of excellence in medicine.

""The primary healthcare system has to be beefed up to prevent the rush at medical colleges. There should be excellent treatment centres for diseases like neurology, hematology and cancer,"" he added.

8,Toyota to increase production capacity,"BANGALORE: For the automobile industry it is the season of high demand. Hence the purr on the production front.

To start with, Hyundai announced that it will increase its production capacity at its Chennai plant, then General Motors said it will follow suit. And now Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) has decided to increase its annual production by 25-30 per cent.

With Corolla, the world''s largest selling sedan from the Toyota family, burning the Indian roads, the company has received the eagerly awaited nod from Japan to go ahead with its production expansion.

Toyota''s plant in Bidadi near Bangalore, currently produces 45,000 units annually. But with the demand for Corolla rising on a weekly basis, the auto major has decided to up its capacity to around 60,000 units.

TKM managing director A. Toyoshima said, ""With the market growing at such speed, we need to keep pace with it through increased supply of our products. Hence we feel it is necessary to expand our capacity.""

Toyota is looking to sell 35,000 units of Qualis and 10,000 units of Corolla in 2004. This will translate to production at optimum capacity at its plant. Pressure has mounted on its production lines, and increasing the capacity is the need of the hour.

The company is also trying to improve productivity of its team members. ""Qualis and Corolla are leaders in their respective segments. We feel that in order to capture more market share, we need to produce better,"" Toyoshima said.

Presently the waiting period for Corolla is weeks and Toyota is trying to bring this down to around 2 weeks, by improving production.

Toyoshima is however resisting the temptation of bringing in the diesel version of the Corolla into the Indian market. ""We realise that there is quite a big market for diesel cars. But we will not be able to provide for so many diesel cars at this point,"" he said.

Earlier, Hyundai had announced that it will increase its production capacity from 1.50 lakh units to 2.5 lakh and GM said it will increase its capacity to 50,000 units.
