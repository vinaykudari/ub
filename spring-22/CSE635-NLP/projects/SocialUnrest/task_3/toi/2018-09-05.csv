1,Marandi govt may not return to power,"bokaro: jharkhand minister of science and technology and founder leader of jharkhand vananchal congress samaresh singh launched the first batch of his party cadre —jharkhand tigers — at the party headquarters here on sunday. one hundred jharkhand tigers, who had earlier worked under adverse circumstances, were awarded certificates by singh. earlier, talking to the mediapersons, singh said the people of jharkhand were not happy with the present government and if this state of affairs continues, it might not return to power again. the main demands of the people — creation of jobs and increase in reservation have not been fulfilled yet, he said and added that unless the government crosses the bureaucratic hurdles and takes quick decisions, it would not become popular. about the growth of extremism in jharkhand, the minister said not much is being done to bring the extremist elements in the mainstream of the society and unless they are offered jobs and welcomed with honour, it is difficult to curb their activities. he said the word atmasamarpan is not relevant these days and it should be better referred to as home-coming. about the ongoing tussle for the leadership for the krantikari ispat mazdoor sangh, singh said it is an ideological fight and not a personal one. in an obvious reference to the remarks made at the friday rally of the krantikari ispat mazdoor sangh break away faction, he said the battle of kurukshetra would be fought at jharia and not bokaro as booth capturing and violence is not in the culture of bokaro. a rally would be taken at ranchi by his party on november 28 to press for development of jharkhand and eradication of corruption, the minister said.

4,Sports policy gathering dust,"lucknow: the present state government may be anything but kind and caring to the sports fraternity. two sports ministers have come gone and the third is in the saddle. but the much-awaited sports policy is still to see the light of the day. before the policy was framed, one did not mind any amount of excuse trotted out by the government, except the delay, of course. now that the policy is in place, it is not being implemented and is still confined to the files. if sources are to be believed, the policy is gathering dust because of the ""vested interest"" of the directorate officials. and the interest? the policy recommends that the directorate should be made directorate general for smooth functioning. that would limit the role of the present officials of the directorate. the directorate general, if it comes into existence, will have an ias officer with super time scale as its head. the man, whose brainchild the draft is, feels that an ias officer should be able to coordinate better between the directorate and various other government departments. his job it must be to see that there is no hitch in clearing different schemes, arranging funds and ensuring implementation of policies relating toteams, coaching, associations and other related matters. the new sports policy requires two directors under the director general - one for administration and other to look into the technical aspect. a pcs officer will oversee the administrative work and sportspersons working in the directorate should be responsible only for jobs related with training and coaching. the sports directorate officials are not happy with their curtailed roles, as suggested in the blue print. sources also say they have managed to get the minister to delay it till as long as possible. but for how long? that remains to be seen. the late kd singh 'babu' was the first sportsperson to become the director. jaman lal sharma and anand shukla came after him. now, vijay singh chauhan (acting) is in the chair. the contention of each of these has always been that they (with sporting background) understand the needs of sportspersons better than anybody else. but times have changed. professionalism is the key to progress. and it does not necessarily mean a sportsperson has to be at the helm.

8,"3 killed, 4 hurt in separate incidents","new delhi: two persons were murdered and and one killed in separate incidents in trans-yamuna area in the last 24 hours. a bystander was killed and four others injured when two groups clashed and opened fire in jagatpuri in east delhi on monday night. according to police officials, a few days back there had been a power riot in jagatpuri during which some agitated residents had snatched a police wireless set. an inquiry had been launched into the matter. about two days back, nayeem, a resident of the same locality threatened kalua to pay him rs 2,000 or he would falsely implicate kalua for stealing the wireless set. kalua did not agree and the duo had a quarrel. on monday, nayeem reportedly called the police control room and accused kalua of having snatched the set. both kalua and nayeem were summoned. when the police officials realised the matter had more to do with an ego clash than the wireless set, they tried to get the two groups to compromise. at about 11.30 pm the two groups finally agreed to settle the matter peacefully and left the police station. however, a little later nayeem told kalua that a true compromise would only be reached if he apologised. but kalua's refusal reportedly led to a pitched battle during which shots were fired. a bystander, taufiq ahmed (28), was hit while four were injured in the fight. one of them is still critical. police said they have been able to identify most of the accused and would be arresting them soon. in dilshad garden, a 16-year-old boy was allegedly stabbed to death by his friend, also 16, over a trivial matter. police officials said the victim monu, a resident of nand nagari, had sold his bicycle to his friend for rs 250 about a year back. however, his friend had only given him rs 200, promising to pay the remaining money later. this had reportedly led to several arguments between the duo. on monday, the duo had another argument and monu was allegedly stabbed to death by his friend. the police have arrested the accused and have charged him with murder. in gokalpuri, an unidentified man was found lying seriously injured in a pool of blood near government senior secondary school, nehru vihar. the victim was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. the victim had apparently been hit on the head with a blunt object.

10,Contractors' ways to double income,"new delhi: when the municipal corporation of delhi decides to construct a primary school, on classroom almost always requires a budget of not less than rs 4 lakh. no surprise, then, that the budget for a complete school easily exceeds rs 1 crore. in the last two months, bjp leaders have inaugurated or laid the foundations of several schools with a budget between rs 1 crore and rs 1.8 crore each. here are some sample projects which mayor shanti desai, outer delhi mp sahib singh and standing committee chairman prithviraj sawhney inaugurated recently. may 30: sawhney lays the foundation stone laid for a school building at karna gali, vishwas nagar. it will cost rs 65 lakh for 10 class rooms, one hall, two staff rooms and two toilet blocks. july 2: sahib singh inaugurates school at village naharpur with 17 class rooms. cost rs 76 lakh. july 12: mayor lays foundation stone for building in prem nagar in karol bagh. the three-storeyed building will cost rs 1.82 crore. july 16: a building in k block, uttam nagar, inaugurated by sahib singh. it will cost rs 1.10 crore. july 21: building inaugurated at than singh nagar, karol bagh, with 16 class rooms and an assembly hall. it cost rs 1.10 crore. august 9: mayor lays foundation of a rs 1.7 crore building in a slum colony in wazirpur. school to have 26 classrooms. august 26: sahib singh inaugurates a two-storeyed building at palam enclave constructed at the cost of rs 45 lakh which has 20 classrooms. despite these astronomical sums spent on the construction of schools, the buildings are, more often than not, unsafe. it was in the midst of the inauguration spree in july that a school building in sector 16 of rohini was declared unsafe. the corporation discovered that four rooms in the double-storeyed building had ceilings that leaked with their plastering peeling off. the corporation ordered the demolition of the unsafe portions of the building and claimed to have blacklisted the contractor. the truth is that portions which were declared safe in the same building were not in a very good condition either. despite the building being under construction, the tiles on the stairs are already cracking. a bjp councillor says: ``this is the crux of the problem. the mcd spends more money per square feet of construction as compared to upmarket private schools. and the quality of our construction is nowhere near theirs. this is because engineers and contractors find ways of extra construction. a school inaugurated recently in rohini has an underground watertank of 50,000 litres but has only 500 students. in other cases, entire grounds are paved with tiles and children do not have a grass plot to play on.'' an engineer says: ``boundary walls of schools are constructed higher than prescribed limits and a road will be constructed nearby. maybe a drain will be laid around the school. in fact, one is likely to come across many schools where the building byelaws have been violated because the engineers have allowed extra construction.'' explaining the modus operandi, the engineer says: ``the mcd invites bids for constructing a building and awards the project to the the lowest bidder. the bid might be for only rs 30 lakh. but the engineer will award extra work to the same contractor, which is not shown in the tender. finally, the school building will end up costing almost double the original amount.'' despite such heavy expenditure on construction of schools, the mcd spent only rs 67 crore of the total annual budgetary allocation of rs 130 crore in year 2000-2001. it surrendered the rest of the money to the delhi government as it could not utilise it.

""the congress also criticises the indifferent attitude of the shiro-mani akali dal headed by parkash singh badal for its failure to op-pose the proposed move to saffro-nise the education. it is unfortu-nate that the akali dal, when out of power, had been launching vari-ous morchas and agitations and de-manding more power for states, while the 'saffronisation' move is directly aimed at infringing on the rights of the states,"" khaira said. he said the ruling akali dal should wake up and oppose this nefarious move as sooner or later it is also going to harm the sikhs who were a minority community.
