1,"Geopolitics binds India, Iran","NEW DELHI: The presence of Iranian President Seyyed Mohammed Khatami as the chief guest at the Republic Day parade on Sunday is a tribute to the manner in which geography affects politics.

If things go as the two countries have outlined in the New Delhi Declaration, both countries stand to gain from this relationship.

The most important outcome would be that India would be able to bypass the Pakistani blockade and rapidly open up new rail and road routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia through the port of Chah Bahar.

A delegation of Iranian businessmen is also in India at this time, exploring the possibility of developing a North-South corridor through a bigger port at Bandar Abbas to become an alternate route to the Russian Federation and Europe. Iran also hopes to create a new sea-bridge to supply LNG to India.

What binds the two countries is a key axiom of geopolitics - my enemy''s enemy is my friend. Pakistan is not quite an adversary of Iran, but the twisted clerics who send jehadi terrorists to India are also the ones who consider the 20 per cent Shias of Pakistan as apostates and attack them.

As a result, the kind of trust that Pakistan enjoyed during the 1971 war when Iran supplied Islamabad with fighters and spare parts has gone and been replaced by wary mistrust.

Anothing important binding factor is that Iran, like India, has a sense of its own history and its place in the world. This came from a joint perception that Pakistan''s control of Afghanistan was a negative development.

Teheran and New Delhi therefore cooperated in backing the Northern Alliance and are determined to check Pakistan in Afghanistan.

Iran also wants to ensure that it is not hemmed in by the US and is seeking Indian investments to develop infrastructure as well as markets for its oil products.

But the logic of New Delhi''s search for better relations comes from a glance at the map. Bordering Central Asia and dominating the Persian Gulf and the Arabian peninsula, Iran is a key Islamic country as well as well-endowed with oil and natural gas.

But what a map does not quite say is that Iran is huge, about half the size of India, has vast reserves of oil and is a market for the kind of goods India would like to export.

2,RSS welcomes BPCL disinvestment; silent on HPCL,"NEW DELHI: In a virtual U-turn, the RSS, which had steadfastly opposed disinvestment in the oil sector on strategic grounds, on Monday welcomed the government''s move to make a public offer for BPCL but said Public Sector oil firms should be strengthened to compete globally.

""We are not opposed for the sake of opposition. We are glad the Government has accommodated our suggestion that some portion of the equity in BPCL be offloaded to public,"" RSS Joint Spokesman Ram Madhav said.

Asked about the decision to sell the equity in HPCL to a strategic partner, he said, ""It will be discussed at our fora.""

RSS sources, however, said it wanted one of the oil PSUs to buy the equity, which the Government has decided to keep out.

Madhav, however, said, ""Today''s global politics is all about oil politics. India with its PSU majors has the potential to play a major role in the global oil market. We feel there is a need to strengthen our PSU oil companies so that they become oil majors and compete on the global platform.""

3,SP to go it alone in UP byelections,"LUCKNOW: The equations between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress have once again become taut. The provocation this time is SP''s surprise move to announce its candidates both for Gauriganj (which falls under Sonia''s Amethi parliamentary constituency) and Haidergarh assembly by-elections, disregarding Congress''s feelers to take on the battle jointly.

UPCC chief Arun Kumar Singh Munna hinted that the party was open to alliance for the bypolls through his exhortations to ""all secular political outfits in the state to unite and give a befitting reply to the coalition with a communal bent"".

His optimism about SP''s ready acceptance had percolated down the party cadre. So much so that even the strongest critics of SP-Congress alliance had reconciled to the possibility.

Naturally, SP''s move has led to much embarrassment and dismay in the Congress ranks. Observers say the over-reaction is understandable, especially in the context of the Gauriganj seat.

4,"UP govt misusing Pota, says Katiyar","LUCKNOW: BJP''s UP president Vinay Katiyar on Sunday fired yet another salvo against the Mayawati government, saying the enforcement of the prevention of terrorism Act (Pota) against jailed MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya and his father tantamounted to its misuse.

Katiyar said, ""Neither Raja Bhaiya nor his father is a terrorist and none of them was found indulging in anti-national activities.""

He said misuse of the Pota in UP will bring a bad name to the Centre. ""This incident may have a cascading effect...Misuse of Pota may start in other states too.""

The state BJP chief said he was not protecting the jailed MLA or his father. ""Both of them are history-sheeters. They could be tried under different Acts. By invoking the Pota against both of them, the state government has violated the spirit of the Act.""

On the seizure of jewellery during a raid on the residence of Raja Bhaiya, Katiyar said possession of jewellery and arms do not make this a fit case for the Pota. Katiyar said he will ensure that the state government rescinds its order and if need be ""I will speak to our national leader in this regard"".

""There should be no political vendetta in the trial of any case. Political leaders always fall prey to any new legislation. Politicians make a law and they are the first to bear the brunt of it,"" Katiyar said. The state government slapped Pota on Raja Bhaiya and his father Udai Pratap Singh on Saturday.

5,Cong shuffle put off till Himachal polls,"NEW DELHI: The fate of many Congress leaders in Delhi hinges on the coming Himachal Pradesh assembly polls.

Even the current instability in Congress-ruled states is being explained by certain Congressmen as an attempt to shift focus from the failures of the Congress leadership here to the state capitals.

According to senior Congress leaders, the AICC reshuffle, that was on the cards after the Gujarat poll debacle, has been put off till after the Himachal elections.

Daggers were out in the Congress after the party''s miserable performance in Gujarat.

An attempt was also made to raise the issue in the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting. The attempt was to get a junior MP to raise the issue of ""ideological deviation"" in the election campaign and point fingers at certain leaders.

""This was the standard procedure during Indira Gandhi''s period to deflect the stigma of failure away from the Congress president and on to certain AICC leaders.

But somehow our attempt failed and the Congress president got exposed to all the criticism for the soft Hindutva campaign in Gujarat,"" said an AICC functionary.

The next opportunity

for the anti-establishment camp was the working committee meeting that was deliberately delayed to avoid speculation of the party getting nervous after the Gujarat defeat.

But by then, those under fire had managed to open fronts in the state capitals.

The change in Maharashtra and the prolonged instability in Rajasthan have preoccupied most party leaders, including Sonia Gandhi, with attention being drawn away from the performance of the AICC leadership.

The dissident pot has been kept boiling in many Congress-ruled states because of the predominance of one faction over others at the AICC.

""The Gandhi family always operated with rival factions in the AICC and in state capitals. But now the balance of power is shifting to just one camp, with all powerful general secretaries and working committee members ganging up to protect their positions. A victory in the Himachal elections is all that is required for them to hang on to their posts,"" said a leader of the rival faction.

The leadership here appears to have convinced Gandhi that all would be well after victory in the Himachal elections.

8,Court notice to Delhi govt on mid-day meal scheme,"NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to the non-implementation of mid-day meal scheme in government schools in the capital, the Delhi High Court on Monday issued notice to City Government on a petition alleging this inaction was discouraging poor children from enrolling in the schools.

9,"Cong opposes HPCL, BPCL disinvestment","NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday strongly opposed the government''s decision on disinvestment in HPCL and BPCL saying that the oil and gas industry is an important part of the strategic sector.

""The Congress has consistently and strongly opposed withdrawal of the State from the strategic sector of which hydrocarbon is a vital part. This position was clearly articulated in the party''s Plenary Session at Bangalore,"" party Spokesman S Jaipal Reddy told reporters here.

There was no compulsion at all to sell off the two oil companies, he said strongly disapproving of the ""unilateral"" steps taken by the government on the issue.

12,RBI asks banks to lay down bill discounting policy,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India has directed banks to lay down a clear cut bill discounting policy and said service sector bills are not eligible for rediscounting.

The policy, subject to approval from their respective boards, should be consistent with the bank''s policy of sanctioning of working capital limits, RBI said in a notification to all scheduled commercial banks on Monday.

The procedure for board approval should include banks'' core operating process from the time the bills were tendered till these were realised, it said.

Banks may sanction working capital limit as also bills limit to borrowers after proper appraisal of their credit needs and in accordance with the loan policy as approved by the board, it said after considering the recommendations of the K R Ramamoorthy panel on ""Discounting of Bills by banks"".

RBI said ""banks may exercise their commercial judgment in discounting of bills of services sector. However, they should ensure that actual services are rendered and accommodation bills are not discounted"".

Further, providing finance against discounting of services sector bills may be treated as unsecured advance, subject to condition that 20 per cent of a bank''s unsecured guarantees and outstanding unsecured advances do not exceed 15 per cent of its total advances.

Bills rediscounts should be restricted to usance bills held by other banks and banks should not rediscount bills earlier discounted by non-bank financial companies except in respect of bills arising from sale of light commercial vehicles and two three wheelers.

RBI said banks should open letters of credit (LCs) and purchase or discount or negotiate bills under LCs only in respect of genuine commercial and trade transactions of borrowers who have been sanctioned regular credit facilities.

While purchasing, discounting, negotiating bills under LCs or otherwise, banks should establish genuineness of underlying transactions, it said.

Banks should not open LCs and purchase, discount, negotiate bills bearing the ""without recourse"" clause as it deprives the negotiating bank of its right to recourse against the drawer under the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The Central Bank also asked banks to be circumspect while discounting the bills drawn by front finance firms set up by large industrial groups on other group companies.

For promoting payment discipline, which to a certain extent would encourage acceptance of bills, all corporates and other borrowers with a turnover above threshold level as fixed by a bank''s board, should be mandated to disclose schedule of their overdue payables in their periodical returns submitted to banks.

""Banks should not enter into Repo transactions using bills discounted or rediscounted as collateral"", RBI added.

13,Mulayam asks PM to contain Maya's 'repressive rule',"NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadad has sought Prime Minister Vajpayee''s intervention to contain the ""increasingly repressive rule"" of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati.

""It has become necessary to put an end to the government-sponsored terror and prevent ongoing human rights violation in the state,"" Mulayam said in a letter to the PM on Monday.

He told reporters that at a conference of his party''s youth wing on February 1 an outline would be drawn for a statewide agitation to protest the ""reign of terror."" He deplored the use of POTA against an MLA, Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, and claimed that such incidents were reminiscent of the Emergency.

Mulayam reminded the PM of his assurance that POTA would not be misused against political opponents. Quoting from home minister Advani''s speech in Parliament during the debate on the harsh legislation, the SP leader said it was ironic that despite the assurance of being a weapon in the campaign against terrorists from across the border, POTA was being used to harass elected representatives.

He claimed that the state government was targeting the opposition legislators by misusing its power. The SP leader said a delegation of his party legislators would soon meet President Kalam to apprise him of the situation in UP.

Mulayam''s letter to the PM and his threat of an agitation were a clear indication that before the budget session of the state assembly next month he was planning to mobilise the opposition forces in UP. With his attempt to topple the Mayawati government having failed, the SP leader''s major challenge now is to keep his flock together and seize the initiative for a counter-move.

14,BJP wants anti-conversion law in state,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The BJP on Monday asked the Kerala government to enact a legislation to prevent forcible religious conversion in the state, on the lines of laws enacted by the Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh governments.

BJP state General Secretary P K Krishnadas, who was a member of the party''s enquiry panel which looked into events that led to the attack on US missionary Joseph W Cooper at Puliyam near Kilimanur on January 13, told reporters here that 15 of the 25 ''Vedar'' families at Puliyam tribal colony had been converted into Christianity through ''enticement or coercion.''

The enquiry found that the attack was a ''reaction to the provocative speeches'' of Cooper and fellow-evangelists. The activities of the Friends of Bible Church, at whose gospel convention speeches denigrating Hindu gods were made, had created communal discord in the region, he said.

Denying that the Sangh Parivar outfits had any role in the attack, he said the police was ''fabricating'' cases against the RSS workers and harassing them. There were no eyewitnesses to the attack, which occurred at around 10 pm and yet police were ''hunting'' RSS workers, he charged.

Instead of pursuing the case in an impartial manner, the Congress, CPI (M) and the police were trying to politicise the issue, Krishnadas said.

15,SC can't stop legal mining: Haryana govt,"NEW DELHI: As the Haryana government told the Supreme Court on Monday that only legal mining was going on in certain areas of the state, senior lawyer Shanti Bhushan pleaded that the apex court could not stop an activity which was done within law and per its directions.

In order to resolve the long pending dispute over the legality of mining in certain parts of Haryana adjacent to the Capital, a Bench comprising Justices Y K Sabharwal and H K Sema said it would pass necessary orders on February 11 after hearing all parties concerned.

The court also asked the Central Empowered Committee ^ which had said that in case mining was stopped, the land covered by the mining activity should not be allotted to the private colonisers -- to give its views.

Mining lease holders''s counsel Bhushan said the mining was being carried out strictly in accordance with the law and that the areas where the activities were being carried out did not fall in forest area.

Haryana government''s counsel Gopal Subramaniam said that of the total area of 217.85 hectares in the Sirohi-Khori Jamalpur zone, mining activity was confined to only 82.10 hectares.

But the CEC said that large scale mining, blasting and transportation of minerals was continuing in violation of court orders.

Lawyer Ranjit Kumar, who was assisting the court in the matter, said that even after the court expressed serious concern and warned of serious consequences for violation of its orders, illegal mining was on in the eco-fragile Aravali hills.

18,SUCI bandh paralyses life in Darjeeling,"DARJEELING: The 24-hour bandh called by the SUCI on Monday paralysed life in Darjeeling town. Yet, life was normal in Kurseong, Kalimpong, Pulbazar, Mirik and Sukhiapokhari, except for vehicular traffic that was stalled in some areas.

Although roads were deserted in Darjeeling town, the toy train service was unaffected. Except for telephone, telegraph and post offices, almost all the central and state government offices, banks and shops remained closed.

However, the attendance of staff at Lal Kothi, headquarters of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, was better compared to the Louis Jubilee complex and other DGHC offices.

DS Bomzon, spokesman of the Communist Party Revolutionary Marxist, congratulated the people on making the bandh a success. The CPRM urged the state government to learn a lesson from this bandh and mitigate the sufferings of the people.

Darjeeling District Hill Congress Committee secretary Lawrence PT Lama said, ""Though the people supported the bandh, it was a harassment for them because the hill people have faced enough bandhs. Also, a bandh is no solution as it distorts the issue.""

Meanwhile, on Sunday afternoon, a GNLF (Janata) poster opposing the bandh was seen at Chowkbazar. Darjeeling GNLF branch committee president Deepak Gurung denied responsibility for that.

It was for the first time in the hills that the SUCI campaigned to make the bandh a success. It even put up posters at Chowkbazar exhorting people to support it. The bandh was called to protest the increase in charges of power, hospital, examination, tuition and court fees, imposition of mutation charge on agricultural land, closing of factories and tea gardens, retrenchment and curtailment of democratic rights.
