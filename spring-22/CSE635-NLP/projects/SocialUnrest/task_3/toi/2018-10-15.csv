0,"On re-election, Laloo lashes out at NDA Govt","patna: rjd chief laloo prasad yadav was formally re-elected president of his party for the third time at the two-day national council meeting and the third plenary session, which began in patna on sunday. rjd minister and party's returning officer jagdanand singh announced that the party had also authorised him to select a fresh national executive and office-bearers. though the rjd is a regional party with roots mainly in bihar, the party's ''national face'', or call it ''national representation'', surprised many here. vague names and faces were introduced as rjd chiefs of assam, delhi, punjab, maharashtra, orissa, kerala and tamil nadu. faces of even local rjd ministers and legislators wore a blank look when their names were announced. ''i am amazed how they remain in the party. i never go to their states,'' confessed laloo while speaking from the stage. praise heaped by some of the rjd leaders from outside bihar appeared over enthusiastic. but some of them, like the party's maharashtra chief laxman menon, complained that laloo was never available for them. remarked s k singh, mumbai's rjd chief: ''if lalooji gives us support then we will make mumbai another bihar.'' the remark left even rjd ministers tittering. party's general secretary and rajya sabha mp ramdev bhandari appeared apologetic about his activities outside bihar. ''we have units in 20 of the country's 28 states,'' he said, adding that units had not been formed in himachal pradesh and chandigarh. speaking after his formal re-election as party president, laloo made a frontal attack on the nda government at the centre, which completed its two years in office on saturday. the vajpayee government is the most corrupt regime the country has ever had, he said, and, referring to the tehelka episode, he added: ''we heard that money was taken in the bofors deal. but we saw with our own eyes the currency notes being counted in the tehelka tapes.'' he asserted that the security of the country was not safe in the nda government's hand and dubbed the samata party and the janata dal (u) leaders as ''servants'' of the bjp. pattal uthate hain, he said.

6,Students with political links may face the heat,"mumbai: the u.s. government's bid to put the clamps on tourists and immigrants has meant that visa procedures have become stricter. applicants now have to fill forms which ask if one is a member of a terrrorist group or if one intends to engage in subversive or terrorist activities in the u.s. ``this is scarcely the most effective screening mechanism,'' says arun c. vakil of the indo-american society and author of gateway to america. ``i suspect that a certain category of applicants will be hit by the present climate of suspicion. indians who have lived in or have links with controversial countries, for example, will have a tougher time. also, students who have been affiliated with political organisations might face problems.'' many consular officers, too, are likely to adopt a `better safe than sorry' approach. ``they're going to drag their feet because they don't want to allow for the possibility of something having gone wrong on their watch,'' says roberto suro, director of the non-profit pew hispanic centre who, however, believes that increasing security at airports will pay greater dividends. indeed, experts believe that while terror tuesday has speeded up the process, immigration modifications were on the anvil. ``u.s. immigration policy has always operated in sync with the economy,'' explains mr suro. ``with the onset of a recession, lawmakers would have felt the pressure to limit new entrants.'' agrees mr vakil, ``in recent years there has been concern over the `browning of america', and now the government has a perfect excuse to do something about it. in the last decade, the u.s. has attracted many immigrants from countries like china, the philippines, india and pakistan. i foresee attempts to curtail immigration from these countries and active encouragement of immigration from europe.'' many in america are, however, determined to counter these trends. ``the identity of this country is based on us being a nation of immigrants,'' says a spokesperson for the lawyers' committee. ``we've built our prosperity by allowing the free flow of ideas and attracting the brightest and most entrepreneurial people from around the world. to stop that flow would weaken the u.s. immensely.''

8,"Cong, NCP woo expelled SP minister","mumbai: there is a tug of war going on between the congress and the nationalist congress party (ncp) to win over the expelled samajwadi party minister nawab malik. both the parties are trying to woo the minister of state for housing who has been expelled from the samajwadi party (sp) for anti-party activities. mr malik, who has all along been in touch with the ncp president sharad pawar, has not yet taken any decision about his future course of action. even though the sp has expelled mr malik from the party, chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has not dropped him so far from the cabinet. mr deshmukh had to drop mr makhram pawar when he was expelled from the bharatiya republican party by its leader mr prakash ambedkar. after his expulsion, mr makhram pawar joined the congress. mr malik said that he had not indulged in any anti-party activity . ``i have always worked for the party but a few persons in the city unit of the party have tried to mislead the party's national leadership resulting in my expulsion'', he added. when asked about his future course of action, he said,``i have not yet taken any decision so far. i will wait and then take a decision.'' replying to a question, he said,``i had called on mr sharad pawar and i am in touch with him.'' the ncp is hopeful that he will ultimately join the party and help the party in its drive to seek support from the muslim community in the state. a section in the congress is also active in trying to rope him into the party. ncp spokesperson vasant chavan claimed that mr malik was inducted into the cabinet from the ncp quota. he hinted that if he joined the ncp the party would have no objection to his continuation in the cabinet. the party has another prominent muslim leader, mr bashir patel, and he has been accommodated by appointing him on the khadi and gramodyog corporation. mr patel and mr malik were two mlas elected on the samajwadi party's ticket during the last assembly elections held in 1999. following a dispute, mr patel split the two-member samajwadi legislature party by forming a separate samajwadi party (b) and later merged his one-member party in the nationalist congress party . the ncp had an alliance with the samajwadi party during the last assembly elections. now, if the ncp accommodates mr malik, it will certainly affect the ncp's relationship with the samajwadi party. the samajwadi party is already cross with the ncp for encouraging defections from its fold.

12,LDF put on the mat over CPI-SFI clash,"thiruvananthapuram: the opposition marxist-led left democratic front (ldf) was on monday put in an embarrassing situation in the kerala assembly when chief minister a.k. antony highlighted the clash between cpi workers and pro-marxist students federation of india (sfi) activists before the state secretariat, to justify the police action against sfi students in the university college on september 27. the occasion was the discussion on the notice of an adjournment motion, sought to be moved by cpm legislature group leader k. balakrishnan, on the 'brutal police attack on sfi students.' though the cpi legislature group leader k.p. rajendran was also one of the four members who had signed the notice, his party colleagues kept mum during the discussion. seeking leave for the adjournment motion, balakrishnan said the government had used the police to terrorise the sfi students in a bid to ensure the growth of the pro-congress kerala students union (ksu) which had started its unit in the university college recently. he alleged the police had lathicharged and stoned sfi students without any provocation. he wanted a judicial inquiry into the incident. chief minister antony, who did not find any fault with the police for its action, said the students before attacking the police had attacked the cpi workers, on a dharna before the state secretariat. thus the september 27 incident was a problem created deliberately by the sfi. amid noisy scenes created by the cpm members, antony quoted from a statement by the cpi district secretary n. aravindan asking the marxist leadership to act against the sfi students who indulged in 'anti-people and primitive' agitational practices on september 27. it was the sfi students who had provoked the police on that day, he further quoted aravindan as having said. antony's quote from the cpi leader's statement embarrassed not only the cpm but also the entire ldf. the chief minister said 32 sfi students were arrested in connection with the incident. a group of sfi students, led by balakrishnan's son vineeth, also attacked the police at the general hosptial where injured students were admitted. three sfi students who were hospitalised jumped police custody. the students also attacked the college principal's residence. he said the government had already held a round of discussion with the representatives of the striking students and teachers on the basis of which the college reopened on monday. in the light of the chief minister's reply, speaker vakkom purushothaman withheld consent to the motion. when the opposition did not stage a walkout, as it used to do on similar occasions, the ruling front members shouted and asked ""why no walk out?"". what the ruling front sought to highlight was the opposition's inability for a joint action in view of the cpi's protest over the sfi attack on its workers before the state secretariat on september 27.

13,"‘Oh, our party has a national face too!’","patna: though the rjd may be a regional party with roots mainly in bihar, party's national face, or call it national representation, surprised many on the first day of its two-day national council meet that began here on sunday. vague names and faces were introduced as states' rjd chiefs from such states as assam, delhi, punjab, maharashtra, orissa, kerala and tamil nadu. when their names were announced in the s k memorial hall to address participants praising party chief laloo prasad yadav, faces of even local rjd ministers and legislators wore a blank look. i am amazed how they remain in the party. i never go to their states, confessed laloo while speaking from the stage during the third national council meet of the party here. praise heaped by some appeared over enthusiastic. a few others complained. if lalooji gives us support then we will make mumbai another bihar, remarked mumbai's rjd chief s k singh, leaving even rjd ministers tittering. however, laxman menon, party's maharashtra chief, complained that laloo was never available for them. whenever i ring up, i am told he will be sitting on puja for the next three hours. when i ring him up again, i am told he will be sitting on puja for the next two hours. this is not the time for sitting on puja. it is the time to campaign, he said. in fact, the fact that laloo was unavailable was aired by many state presidents. only if lalooji can come to southern states, particularly to kerala, at least three or four times, the down-trodden people are ready to accept him as their leader, stated party's kerala chief radhakrishnan. lalooji should spend more time in uttar pradesh and punjab where elections are sheduled to be held in the near future, added party's punjab unit chief kesar singh. digs made against laloo's foes were more pointed. the party may be weak, but it will oppose union ministers from bihar who defame the state from delhi, delhi's raj man singh said.ram vilas paswan talks about rape of dalit women in bihar. he himself has abandoned his dalit wife and married another woman without divorcing her, singh added, insisting that paswan should stop making such utterances in the future. the only recognisable face from outside bihar was jharkhand's akloo ram mahto, who had also been a minister in the rabri ministry in undivided bihar. mahto's focus was on the likelihood of laloo being incarcerated in jharkhand. our lord krishna will come to jharkhand and slay kans (atal bihari vajpayee) and sishu pal (jharkhand chief minister babulal marandi), he said. party's general secretary and rajya sabha mp ramdev bhandari appeared apologetic about his activities outside bihar. we have state units in the country's 20 of the 28 states, he said, adding that units had not been formed in himachal pradesh and chandigarh. the reason for the non-availability of laloo outside bihar was attributed to fodder scam cases. lalooji has to spend 30 days a month in various courts, said mla bhagwatia devi.
