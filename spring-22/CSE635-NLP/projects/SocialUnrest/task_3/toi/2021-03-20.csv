0,Gamangs' marriage on political rocks,"NEW DELHI: The underlying irony of the rift between former Orissa CM Giridhar Gamang and his wife Hema has gone unnoticed. The marriage, which marked the rise of the tribal leader from Koraput many years ago, is now floundering on the rocks of politics. Hema has got the Congress ticket instead of Giridhar.

Giridhar''s marriage, old timers recall, is a dramatic story with every filmi ingredient - resistance, suspense, escape, high drama, and eventually a happy ending.

It apparently faced stiff opposition from his clan. He was, however, determined to marry the girl he loved. Gamang then was a young man, given to recklessness.

So he literally ''abducted'' the bride to Delhi and fearing social sanction, took her to the then PM Indira Gandhi. He sought her ''protection'' in the hour of his trouble.

Fond of the simple, unassuming tribal MP, Mrs Gandhi decided to come to his rescue. ""You have my blessings,"" she reportedly said and hoped they would face no trouble.

Gamang returned to his official residence at V P House in the Capital to begin a new chapter in his life. He was so attached to this flat that later, even after he became a minister in Rajiv Gandhi''s government, he did not take a bigger bungalow.

Now fuming over the denial of the Congress ticket for Koraput which has gone to his wife, Gamang has moved into a hotel. He is toying with the idea of joining the BJP.

BJP too is keen to field him from Koraput - not just because he is popular among the tribals. The party hasn''t forgotten that Vajpayee was defeated by the solitary vote of Gamang in 1999.

The problem is, according to the seat-sharing deal with BJD, Koraput comes under BJD''s quota. Bit that hasn''t deterred BJP from trying to admit Gamang into the party.

Indications are, the party may not mind swapping a tribal seats allotted to it with Koraput to get Gamang.

Gamang feels he alone can win the seat. But it seems, the marriage has come under political strain. Has politics finally conspired to do the Gamangs part?

1,Development to be focal issue in Bharuch poll,"BHARUCH: Elections in Bharuch are likely to be fought on developmental issues this time. A trek through the enormous constituency reveals why.

While neighbouring regions are showing signs of economic development, the seven assembly segments, barring Ankleshwar and Dahej, resemble a barren countryside. Some of the assembly seats like Jambusar, Vagra and tribal areas of Jhagadia, Dediapada and Mangrol have not seen any development since a long time.

Issues like clean drinking water, rail and road connectivity, electricity, soil salinity and unemployment are uppermost in the minds of the 12 lakh voters.

The BJP hopes to tackle drinking water woes of Bharuch and Ankleshwar towns with the recent announcement of a Rs 9 crore mineral water plant at Bharuch. A sports complex near Rajpipla, two new metre-gauge rail lines between Ankleshwar and Rajpipla and Kosamba and Umarpada, and restoration of land to tribals will add some gloss to the BJP campaign.

Bharuch is a tribal-dominated constituency with around 3.5 lakh tribal population constituting almost 30 per cent of the electorate. This is followed by 2.6 lakh OBCs (21 per cent), 19 per cent Muslims, 12 per cent Patels, six per cent Rajputs and around 11.4 per cent are a mix of Brahmins, Vanias and Sindhis.

â€œPost-Godhra, Muslims turned a bit against the BJP especially the Qureshis, Saiyeds, Pathans and Sheikhs who constitute 60,000 Muslim votes. But we do see prospects of winning back their votes, since the issue is development and being a community of small traders they would vote for the BJP to save their interests, and gain some political clout. The Vohras on the other hand have at least one member of their family settled in a foreign country. They are financially well-off and are traditional Congress supporters,â€� says BJP leader Gani Qureshi.

While Jambusar and Vagra are Muslim-dominated areas, Dediapada, Jhagadia and Mangrol are tribal-dominated. â€œForest land compensation for tribal farmers is the main issue in this belt followed by unemployment. We have been instrumental in restoring some land to tribal farmers and the Central Government is now planning to return forest land cultivated by tribals till 1993,â€� says JD(U) candidate for Bharuch constituency Chottubhai Vasava, who is already an MLA from Jhagadia.

A Congress bastion till 1984, Bharuch was represented by Congress general secretary Ahmed Patel, between 1980 and 1984. BJP wrested the seat in 1989 with Chandubhai Deshmukh. Congress leaders hold the Mandal Commission agitation responsible for the debacle. Patel was defeated by Deshmukh again in 1991 and then took a safe route to the Rajya Sabha.

BJP won the seat again in the 1999 by-elections in which Mansukh Vasava won by a mammoth 47,000 votes. While BJP won four assembly segments, Congress won two and Janata Dal (U), managed to wrest one assembly seat.

â€œChottubhai is a dominant factor in this region. It is because of him that we were not able garner much of the tribal votes in 1996 and 1998. He is very popular in assembly constituencies of Jhagadia and Dediapada which has a tribal population of 1.75 lakh. If we manage to get at least 15 per cent of the tribal vote, we can close in on the BJP this time,â€� says former Lok Sabha candidate for Congress Iqbal Patel.

2,Former BJP MP quits party,"LUCKNOW: Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Banda Prakash Narain Tripathi submitted his resignation papers to party''s state president Vinay Katiyar on Friday in protest against the denial of the party ticket to old-timers and deserving candidates.

Charging Kalyan Singh with favouritism, Tripathi alleged that BJP leaders, by selling the party ticket for the forthcoming parliamentary elections, were following in Mayawati''s footsteps.

Tripathi was suspended from the party in 1998 for contesting against the party nominee. His suspension was, however, revoked recently by the party''s state unit with the assurance that he would be given the ticket for Lok Sabha elections from Banda. ""The assurance to this effect was given by Rajnath Singh,"" he claimed.

But senior BJP leader and party spokesperson Lalji Tandon denied that the party had given any such assurance to Tripathi.

""Tickets are finalised by the Central Parliamentary Board not by state leaders,"" he clarified. Tandon, however, admitted that resentment was brewing among few leaders over the denial of the party ticket mainly due to local politics and rivalries.

""It''s natural. There is nothing new in it. It happens in all political parties during the ticket distribution. We can''t satisfy all ticket-seekers. Their anger is momentary and I hope that they would close ranks and work unitedly to strengthen the hands of Vajpayeeji,"" Tandon said, giving no importance to a revolt-like situation in about 22 parliamentary constituencies where the names of candidates were announced on March 14.

While the party is sending teams to pacify the agitated ticket-seekers and quell the rebellion by their supporters, reports emanating from other districts suggest that so far the state leadership has failed to contain the resentment brewing among party leaders in several districts.

Sachchidanand Sakshi Maharaj, once a close aide of Kalyan Singh, has announced to oppose party nominee Mukesh Rajput from Farrukhabad.

Speculations were rife that the BJP might ask him to contest from there. But Kalyan Singh is learnt to have put his foot down denying him the ticket.

He has now taken up cudgels against Kalyan and declared to campaign against the BJP candidates in the Lodh belt.

Former zila panchayat member and senior local leader Bhagat Ram Mishra has also come out in open to oppose the candidature of sitting MP Padamsen Chowdhury in Bahraich. Mishra enjoys the support of the party''s district unit.

""As Sakshi Maharaj is no more in the BJP the party is not expecting him to support our candidates,"" reacted Tandon claiming that the situation was not as serious as being painted in the media by few leaders who were denied the ticket.

""We are seeking reports from all these districts and would initiate action against anyone who would oppose the party candidates,"" Tandon added.
