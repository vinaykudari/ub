0,SP won't join govt,"NEW DELHI: SP also announced its decision to not join the Congress-led government at the Centre while supporting it from the outside, in line with the Left parties.

""We cannot join the government because of our position in UP. If Sonia Gandhi had joined us in forming the government in the state, when we had asked for it, it would have been easier for us,"" Amar Singh said. In any case, there has been no gesture from the Congress to show that it is keen to invite Mulayam''s party to join the government. Mulayam contested LS polls calculating that a ''hung'' House will create space for him to play an important role in defining the shape of the new government. Though SP along with its ally, RLD, posted a record tally of 40 seats, its gameplan went awry as Congress with its allies and the Left could form the government. Also, NDA''s tally stopped short of the mark where they could have hoped to take a shot at government formation with Mulayam''s help.

In an important development in UP, having a bearing on Mulayam''s politics, Speaker Kesrinath Tripathi, a BJP man, quit on Wednesday, paving the way for SP to nominate somebody from its ranks.

2,Verification procedures haunt govt recruits,"PANCHKULA: Verification of ''antecedents,'' ''character'' and other such sundry labels for getting government jobs continues to be as hard as ever. The procedure, a gift of the British Raj, reigns supreme in officialdom even as harried recruits to government departments run from pillar to post to get such certificates.

Obtaining these is essential before one can join government service. Consider the case of 19-year-old Nimish (name changed) who has been going around for 25 days in the mini secretariat here to get his character ''certified'' by any first class magistrate of the district.

""Until a senior officer of the district administration offered me personal help in attesting the certificate, which was duly verified by police, I thought I would lose the job I had been selected for,"" were the words Nimish murmured after getting the certificate. Nimish represents scores of such candidates for whom clearing such obstacles is like banging their heads against the walls of officialdom.

Their skills are put to test when it comes to obtaining final clearance from the district magistrate of the area.

The candidate also has to get himself certified as being ""physically fit"" by the civil surgeon of the district. This certificate too is difficult to obtain. Some departments write directly to the district magistrate while others ask candidates to get things done on their own.

""This is the process that every government servant has to go through. As far as time taken in the process is concerned, yes it takes some time but not so much as to cause panic among them. Even we have gone through the same process,"" City magistrate Vandana Disodia said. Since the candidates are in hurry to join the department, hence they panic in case there is any delay in the process.

The process of getting antecedents verified varies from department to department and from government to government.

Some department write directly to the district magistrate (DM) and the intelligence wing of the police.

3,State BJP gives reasons for party’s debacle,"HYDERABAD: The BJP state office bearers are up in arms against the state party president N Indrasena Reddy holding him responsible for the drubbing party received in the just concluded Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.

The state BJP office bearers who met here for the first time after the partyâ€™s debacle had heated arguments over the issue.

Those vocal in demanding Indrasen Reddyâ€™s resignation were former MP A P Jitender Reddy, state general secretary G R Karunakar and Kisan Morcha state unit president N Venugopal Reddy. However, at the end, the party decided to differ a decision on the issue.

There was also serious criticism of its alliance with the TDP and it felt that the party suffered losses due to the seat sharing. The alliance had been a hindrance in developing the party as a parallel force to TDP and Congress, it felt. They also felt that the soft corner the leadership had towards TDP created problems for the cadre.

Many of the leaders said that TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu did not ask his cadre to work for the victory of BJP candidates. â€œHe did not respect the poll alliance,â€� they are learnt to have said.

Former MP C Janga Reddy, a strong votary of separate Telangana, said the party could have won in at least half a dozen seats in Telangana had it respected Telangana sentiment.

According to state general secretary and MLA elect G Kishan Reddy BJP feels that abnormal power tariff hike, neglect of farmers, anti incumbency lack of cooridation between TDP and BJP has led to the debacle of BJP. â€œWe will take up agitations on peopleâ€™s issues and prepare for 2009 elections. The party will be developed as parallel force to TDP and Congress in the state,â€� he said.

4,'CM' stalls govt formation,"BANGALORE: Who will be the next chief minister of Karnataka? Nobody seems to know. The tug of war over the CM''s post has brought the state to a standstill.With neither the JD(S) nor the Congress yielding an inch, the ''hung'' suspense continues.

A similar stalemate stares the students in the face. Unless the new government is in place, the CET impasse will continue.

But how long will the political tamasha drag on? The answer lies on how much ground JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda covers with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi during his meeting with her in New Delhi on Thursday. While both parties want CM''s post, the only issue they agree on is a Congress-JD(S) coalition government.

However, the first-time MLAs from all parties do not want either President''s rule or dissolution of the House. ""Nobody is prepared for another election and some of the MLAs are not sure of whether they will come back. The newcomers in the JD(S) do not mind reconciling to being number two as long as they participate in the government,"" a JD(S) leader said. JD(S)LP leader Siddaramaiah, P.G.R.

Sindhia and M.P. Prakash will be in New Delhi on Thursday.

Congress CM contenders Mallikarjun M. Kharge, Dharam Singh and H.K. Patil are still in Delhi. The BJP is meeting on May 23 to elect its floor leader, but this hinges on the Cong-JD(S) talks. Meanwhile, the JD(U) which won five seats met the Governor T.N. Chaturvedi on Wednesday.
