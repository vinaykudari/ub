0,PAU V-C asks farmers to adopt precision farming,"RAUNI, Patiala: Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor Kirpal Singh Aulakh,while presiding over a function during a kisan mela here on Friday said that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had drawn a line between rich and poor countries and India should study the system of subsidies given to farmers in developed countries and change its policies to provide financial incentives to farmers at par with them.

The vice-chancellor called upon Punjabi farmers to adopt precision farming in order to minimise cost of production, maximise profits and also to improve the quality of the farm produce in accordance with the quality parameters required in the international market.

Aulakh said precision farming involves the use of the right type of inputs, like seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, in correct doses and at correct a time. He said other operations like sowing, harvesting and post-harvest activities should be undertaken according to the advice of experts.

Aulakh said Punjab which had the distinction of being called the granary of India was facing many problems like degradation of soil health and depletion of underground water. He expressed concern that the ground water level was going down by 47 cm every year in some central districts of the state. ''''If this trend continues, our farmers would have to spend Rs 2,000 crore on installation of submersible pumps.

Aulakh said that weedicides worth Rs 500 crore could be saved by adopting PAU recommendations regarding their application. Speaking about the increasing content of nitrates in the soil due to non-judicious use of fertilisers was also ringing alarming bells and nitrate toxicity had been observed in animals as well as human beings.

''''Precision farming is the answer to all these problems,'''' concluded Aulakh. Dr. Jaspinder Singh Kolar, director, extension education, PAU, advised the farmers to adopt cost-effective technologies like zero tillage and bed-planting for wheat cultivation so as to reduce the cost of production. Stressing upon the need for diversification, Kolar advocated the cultivation of berseen, raya, gobhi, sarson, winter maize and gram.

Dr Goyinder Singh Nanda, director, research, expressed concern over the proliferation of unrecommended varieties of some crops, resulting not only in economic loss to farmers but also leading to diseases caused by insects and pests.

Dr Jasbir Singh Samra, director (seeds), said that more than 8,000 kits of seeds of 22 varieties of different crops and vegetables were purchased by visiting farmers. He said farmers were showing more interest in vegetable seeds, which was an encouraging sign for diversification of farming.

Addressing a large gathering of farmers, Patiala MP Preneet Kaur asked the Centre to announce and effectively implement the minimum support price for pulses, oilseeds and maize. She said that in the absence of assured marketing and remunerative prices, it will not be possible to divert 10 lakh hectares from paddy-wheat rotation to these crops.

1,Slain MLA's father threatens suicide,"BATHINDA: Gyan Singh, father of former Pucca Kalan MLA Baldev Singh who had died in the bomb blast that killed former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh, has threatened to immolate himself in front of Congress president Sonia Gandhi''s residence after September 14 if his son was not given due regard by the state government and the Congress.

If at a function organised at Payal on August 31 to pay homage to Beant Singh on his death anniversary, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had asked the Prime Minister to confer Bharat Ratna on the late CM, the enraged father has written a letter to Sonia, asking why his son was being ignored.

""While Beant Singh''s family is being honoured year after year, and his death anniversary is being observed as â€˜martyrdom day'', it is sad that Baldev, whose sacrifice was no less, has never been remembered. The Congress is being very unjust by ignoring my son,"" he said.

Baldev Singh, who was considered very close to Beant Singh, had suffered serious injuries in the blast on August 31, 1995. While Beant Singh had been killed on the spot, Baldev had succumbed to his injuries on September 14.

Baldev''s mother Kartar Kaur said that after her son''s death, a number of senior Congress leaders, including Buta Singh, had visited the family and announced that a memorial would be built in his memory. ""They had also promised to erect his statue.

However, after eight years of the incident, neither the statue nor the memorial has come up,"" she rued. Gyan Singh said that neither the bureaucracy nor Congress leaders had given his son the respect he deserved.

""Last year, when we were at Payal, attending a function held to pay homage to Beant Singh, Amarinder had assured us that a similar function would be organised at Pucca Kalan. The promise was never delivered,"" he said.

Gyan Singh claimed he had also approached Punjab Congress president H S Hanspal on August 27 and told him how his son was being ignored. ""But Hanspal was disinterested. We also came to know that Congress general secretary Moti Lal Vora had asked the state government to give representation to a family member of Baldev Singh in a board or a corporation, but nothing has happened so far,"" said the disgruntled father.

""Time and again, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) president Ashok Singhal has reiterated that the Sangh Parivar will replicate the Gujarat experiment in communally sensitive areas. The disturbances in Sagar and Kalladka in Dakshina Kannada seem to be inspired by Singhal''s ideologies,"" Poojary told a press conference here.

6,Wipro to state govt: Want funds? Be transparent,"BANGALORE: Expressing apprehensions on the state government''s level of transparency and accountability on public spend, Wipro has cold-shouldered the government''s request that the software giant partly fund the proposed conversion of Sarjapur Road.

The Public Works Department had requested Wipro to provide Rs 8-10 crore for the project, the first phase of which is estimated to cost about Rs 13 crore. The 5-km stretch will link the Outer Ring Road to the railway crossing, while the second phase will connect the railway crossing to Sarjapur village.

Last Monday, Wipro wrote back to the principal secretary, PWD, Karnataka, saying: ""You must be aware that large organisations like ours work with certain policy parameters and have to account for every rupee spent. Therefore, any contribution will have multiple implications, which we would like to avoid."" A copy of the letter was obtained by The Times of India.

Wipro argues that the only sustainable way is to improve the capability of the system by catalysing appropriate changes. This, it says, is what the company has set out to do.

""Similarly, with better tax reforms by the government, large investment on infrastructure can be met through tax collection,"" the letter said.

It may be recalled that in July, Wipro chief Azim Premji had threatened to stage a dharna against the poor infrastructure in and around Sarjapur Road, where the company''s head office is located. Upon which, the state government had set up a task force to look into the matter. The state government had also sought the support of established industrial houses and those coming up on and around this road.

Reacting to Wipro''s stand, principal secretary (public works) K.L. Negi said the government would go ahead with the project without Wipro''s contribution. ""We had three plans for Sarjapur Road. Had Wipro contributed, we would have implemented Plan I â€” develop road up to railway crossing only. Now that we are not taking any funds from Wipro, we are implementing Plan III to develop entire stretch of Sarjapur Road,'''' he pointed out.

Under Plan III, Sarjapur Road connecting Sarjapur village and Attibele crossing will be developed at a cost of Rs 30 crore. ""We hope to receive 50 per cent funds from financial institutions. There are 20 other firms interested in funding the remaining portion."" The firms are meeting the government on September 16.

""We have to discuss the guidelines these firms will lay down. A final picture will emerge after the meeting,"" he added.

13,India can't cut farm subsidy: FM,"NEW DELHI: Attacking developed nations for their stance on agriculture and market access, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh on Saturday said that India could not bring down subsidies to the farm sector as food security and welfare were more important to the country.

""Developed nations, which provide $320 billion worth of subsidies to their agriculture, are asking us to reduce subsidy and open up our markets. We can''t do it,"" Singh said, referring to the tough negotiations at the ongoing Cancun meeting of WTO.

In an interview to Doordarshan, he said that the level of subsidy in developed nations was substantially high at almost $1 billion a day. Even for one cattle, the subsidy provided is to the tune of $2.

""If someone asks us to stop giving subsidies to agriculture, we will not listen to him,"" Singh said.

The Finance Minister, who met former commerce minister Arun Shourie on Friday, said that the Cancun meeting was not the totality of WTO and WTO was not all of global trade.

""For India, agriculture is not a mere economic activity but a way of life. Our culture is linked to agriculture. We want subsidies to come down but at the same time ensuring food security is important,"" he said.

Referring to the ""ship-to-mouth"" era a few decades ago when foodgrains had to be imported to meet the needs of the masses, Singh said ""now we are self-sufficient"".

15,AIPJD to contest elections on its own,"MYSORE: State AIPJD president K N Nagegowda on Saturday said that his party will contest the 224 assembly seats and 28 parliament seats in the state in the next general elections, on it''s own.

However, his party is not against accepting support from Vijaya Mallya headed Janata Party or other like minded parties, which include CPI CPM and RPI.

At a press meet he said it is wrongly reported that AIPJD candidate for Hungund is Vijay Mallyaâ€™s choice. ""Mallya has unconditionally and unilaterally announced his support to our candidates and we have accepted it,"" he said and added: ""there is nothing wrong to accept the support if somebody is willing to do it on his own.""

Reiterating his stand that there will be no merger of AIPJD with JD(S) without working out the modalities of merger he said: ""now as our party is a registered party , merger will have to take place at the national level on equal terms of give and take.""

""There is no question of his party surrendering to any other party to fulfill the political aspirations of some individuals,"" he declared .

""Joining hands or forging a merger for the sake of gaining power, will not augur well with the party and itâ€™s workers,"" he said adding that it''s only Bommai and Hegde, who have to finalise the merger and no one else.

Denying any rift in his party rank and file , Nagegowda said there is no question of any legislator or a leader leaving AIPJD to join JDS. ""All the news about a split in the AIPJD legislature party and a major chunk of leaders quitting it by October 1, if the merger was not finalised, were rumors and there is no truth in them,"" he said.

Nagegowda was evasive on most of the questions asked by the reporters in regard to absence of AIPJD legislators from many of the meetings in the last couple of days.

Nagegowda said all the leaders, who are said to be planning to quit the party are joining his leader S R Bommai in electioneering in Hungund by poll. ""Our party is going to win both Vemagal and Hungund seats,"" he said claiming that his party is going to emerge as a major force in the state''s political arena in the near future.

""In Hungund we are ahead of everybody in the race and it is the Congress, which is going to finish second to us in the election,"" he replied to a question.

He said he would tour the state intensively in the next three months and organise taluk and district level conferences to galvanise the party machinery for the next elections.

16,MBA admissions: Mad rush for govt seats,"AHMEDABAD: Government seats, even in Self-Financed Institutes sold like hot cakes with admissions to the MBA seats closing on Saturday after all the 1,355 seats in government colleges and government quota in SFIs getting filled up.

The Joint Admission Committee for professional courses (JAC-PC) was forced to cancel interviews of students with merit numbers from 3001 to 4401, to be held on September 15.

Further, of the total 801 admissions to medical colleges, 659 students opted for government colleges while just 142 went for SFIs. Similarly, of the 758 engineering admissions, 401 were in government colleges while 357 were in SFIs. No decision has yet been taken about students of MS University Vadodara who have sought admission from petrochemical engineering diploma course to chemical engineering degree course at Gujarat University.

Meanwhile, resentment among students and parents at the end of the first week of admissions, is palpable. Many of them blamed the state government for not acting promptly and going into appeal to force SFIs to lower their fee, as done by the Maharashtra government.

Said a visibly shaken Kaushik Parikh: ""I do not understand how the government can keep us on tenterhooks? How can you not decide the fee structure beforehand?"" He said his daughter would never had taken admission to Surat Municipal Corporation-run medical college had they known they would have to pay Rs 3.50 lakh instead of Rs 1.15 lakh.

""Just after the interview was over, we were informed of the new fee. From where will I raise this kind of money for five years?"" he demanded.

Gyanendrakumar Tyagi, too would not have taken his daughterâ€™s admission to a self-financed institute had it not been for a printing error. ""The booklet that lists various professional colleges, did not identify Parul College of Engineering as an SFI and we mistakenly opted for that college,"" Tyagi said.

A student Vaibhav Vaishnav, whose interview is on Saturday is worried that if the fee committee eventually decides to hike the fee, then what will he do. ""If the fee structure would have been decided, I would have taken a decision easily. But if I do take admission now, and later if the fee is increased, I donâ€™t know how will I be able to pay the fee,"" Vaishnav said.

The All India Democratic Studentsâ€™ Organisation, which has been holding dharna for the past three days opposite JAC-PC office has received more than 50 written complaints from parents.

Commissioner of higher and technical education, Rajiv Gupta rebutted all allegations and said that the government has had to make a difficult decision, and that there are bound to be problems in the initial stage.

""This is a year of transition and so teething problems are to be expected. If we would have delayed the admissions further, and indulged in another round of litigation, students would have been force to miss their first academic session,"" Gupta asserted.

17,Mobile phone leads to arrest of dacoit gang,"KOLKATA: Laloo Mollah is ruing every moment he spends behind bars. The 25-year-old robbery kingpin now dreads the sight of cell phones. For Mollah''s inability to switch off a robbed cell phone lead to his arrest along with his gangmembers.

Now in the police net and facing three robbery charges, he faces the possibility of a decade behind bars if convicted.

Mollah and his gang were a terror in the Kolkata Maidans, attacking hapless people and robbing them of whatever they had. The cops had no inkling on this gang but the modus operandi in atleast three successive cases appeared similar. They emerged from nowhere, attacked at gunpoint and fled in darkness.

Recently, at 2:50 am Haradhan Gupta, a Howrah-businessman was travelling at J K Island near Fort William. Mollah, with two aides, stopped the car and attacked Gupta. Gupta was assaulted and Rs 9,400 and a cell phone were robbed. He was later removed to SSKM hospital.

This was the third such case since July. That month Dilip Kumar Sau was looted at gunpoint. In August, Rishra resident Gouri Shankar Pande was robbed. Both the incidents had happened past midnight, Maidan police station officer in charge Asis Sengupta said.

The police ascertained Gupta''s cell phone number and dialled up. Mollah at the other end in a bid to switch off the phone actually switched it on.

Mollah along with Muzzafar Haldar and Sahebuddin Mollah were arguing how to divide the loot and discussing their escape route. They decided to take a taxi from Majherhat bridge to Mograhat, South 24-Parganas. Just as they were fleeing, the police intercepted them. All just due to Mollah''s ignorance with cell phones.

18,MSUSU polls on September 22,"VADODARA: The M S University will hold studentsâ€™ union polls on September 22. A decision in this regard was taken at a special syndicate meeting called on Saturday to decide the date of the polls after the interim injunction on the polls was vacated on Friday.

The interim injunction granted by a city civil court on the basis of a petition filed by one Manish Magan Rohit. He had pleaded that the university''s decision to divide the Faculty of Commerce into four units for the polls was arbitrary and illegal. The university had argued that the amendment in the structure was valid and the syndicate had the power to make such a change.

The court vacated the stay on Friday and student leaders approached the university authorities seeking a date for the polls. Vice chancellor K C Upadhyay convened a meeting of the syndicate for taking a decision on the polls. While Saturday''s meeting fixed September 22 as the date of the polls, some syndicate members, too, opposed the division of the faculty of commerce. Syndicate member Deepak Shah said this was not necessary as the faculty representatives did not represent a particular unit, but the faculty as a whole.

""Tomorrow there can be a demand for general secretaries for individual buildings as well,"" Shah said. Notably, under an earlier syndicate resolution the university has to hold union polls by September 15 every year. The delay this year will only be an exception. The nominations have already been filed. The withdrawal could not take place in wake of the court case. A fresh date for withdrawal could be announced on Monday. Polls for the faculty associations of arts and science will be held on Monday. The polls have become critical this year as their results will have a bearing on the union polls scheduled on September 22.

Seven candidates are in the fray for the post of the faculty general secretary in Faculty of Science Association. The main contenders are Karan Rana, Aniruddh Pandey, Shekhar Shrivastav and Nimish Shah. In all, nine candidates will battle it out for the post of FGS in the Faculty of Arts Association where Rakesh Rathod, Bhavin Helaiya and Lalchand Pal are regarded strong contenders. Class representatives in these associations will also be elected on Monday.

20,Maldharis meeting to protest civic drive,"AHMEDABAD: To protest against the recent drive undertaken by municipal authorities to deal with cattle menace, members of the Maldhari community will organise a gathering on Sunday at the Maldhari Cricket Maidan here.

The drive follows a government resolution passed on September 2, 2003, that gives municipal bodies a free hand to impound stray cattle and detain them which otherwise lead to road accidents, traffic disturbances and also disease outbreaks especially during monsoon.

â€œWe call it a black act as it gives municipal bodies a free hand to harass us and beat our cattle up.We oppose it and will hold a big gathering on Sunday to protest against this act,â€� said Tejabhai Desai, an activist, while talking to newsmen here on Saturday.

The main contention of the Maldharis is that have no place to go as in the wake of urbanisation they have been driven out of villages and cities and in the name of preserving forest areas, they have been driven away from there too.

â€œIn Ahmedabad for instance, Maldharis were allowed to occupy a sewage farm. But, they were driven away from there too after people in neighbouring areas complained that they were being put at an inconvenience. Now they have no place to keep their cattle,â€� said Lallubhai Desai of Manav Kalyan, an NGO dedicated to the cause of human rights.

In their meeting on Sunday they plan to submit written appeal to both Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA). â€œWe will request them to give us alternative settlement and not capture milch cattle and their calves. They may ban Maldharis from letting their cattle loose in other areas of the city,â€� said Laljibhai Desai, with NGO Marag.
