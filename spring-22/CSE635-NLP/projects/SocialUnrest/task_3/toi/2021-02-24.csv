0,HC notice to police on arrest,"NEW DELHI: An alleged terrorist has challenged his arrest by the special cell before the Delhi High Court.

Alfat Hussain Wani on Tuesday moved a petition claiming that the special cell had implicated him in a false case which was registered in 2002.

Justice R S Sodhi has issued notice to the Delhi Police and asked them to file a reply to Waniâ€™s allegations. Charged by a lower court under Explosive Act recently, Wani claimed the special cell had intimated his parents in Kashmir about his arrest 10 days before they actually apprehended him.

2,"Strike paralyses banks, govt offices","MUMBAI: Work at state and central government offices, hospitals and nationalised banks and insurance companies was badly hit on Tuesday as employees across the state struck work to protest the Centreâ€™s â€œanti-labour policiesâ€™â€™ and the supreme courtâ€™s decision to ban strikes.

Several schools and colleges also remained closed as teachersâ€™ unions backed the nationwide agitation called by Left trade unions. However, transport services and airline operations remained largely unaffected in the city. The Indian Banks Association said the day-long strike brought public sector banks to a standstill nationwide.

The State Bank of India said its national losses were to the tune of Rs 100 crore. L.K. Nagda, joint secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association, claimed that most public sector banks and even some private ones remained shut, affecting clearing and forex transactions.

In Mumbai, bank employees held a protest demonstration at Hutatma Chowk in the afternoon. Nearly 75 per cent of over 19 lakh state government employees also stayed away from work.

Mantralaya wore a deserted look, with peons to personal assistants joining the bandhwagon. The state cabinet, which usually meets at Mantralaya, chose the chandeliered suite of the Sahyadri guesthouse for its weekly Tuesday meeting.

Chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar said attendance at Mantralaya was around 25 per cent, with only 1,845 of 7,288 staffers reporting for duty. State employees held a rail roko at Goregaon for 15 minutes in the morning.

With hospital staffers, including nurses and ward boys, staying away from work in the city, surgeries scheduled for Tuesday had to be postponed. St GeorgeHospital, CST, did not operate its ambulances.

Transport and other services remained unaffected because the Shiv Sena-controlled Sthaneeya Lokadhikar Samiti and the Bharatiya Kamgar Sena, as also the railway and BEST employee unions, did not participate in the strike because of â€œdifferencesâ€™â€™ with Leftist unions.

3,Cong gears up to prevent oppn poaching partymen,"BANGALORE: In what is being seen as a political strategy, the state Congress leadership will meet ticket-seekers to explain the critera for selection of candidates to checkmate the opposition parties from poaching the â€˜disappointedâ€™ partymen.

â€œOther parties have no candidates. They are waiting for our list so that they can lure the disappointed ones. We will disappoint them by not giving room for this,â€™â€™ KPCC president B. Janardhana Poojary told reporters here on Tuesday.

The first meeting of the 28-member State Election Committee will be held on Wednesday to vet the Lok Sabha applications.

The party had received 104 applications including 57 from the general category and 47 from scheduled castes and tribes. There are 12 women aspirants and the party had collected Rs 19 lakh as application fee.

For the 224 assembly constituencies, 1,800 applications have been issued so far. The number is expected to cross 3,000 with the last date being February 28.

Asked whether there would be more entrants into the party, Poojary promised to give some â€œthrillingâ€™â€™ news in the days to come. â€œThose joining will be from unexpected quarters,â€™â€™ was all he said, when persistently asked to disclose the names.

On former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowdaâ€™s announcement of coming out with a chargesheet against the Krishna government, Poojary dubbing it as a kapola kalpita (self created) one, said: â€œWe respected his position and kept silent all these days. We can also come out with material against him. What has his party done on the farmersâ€™ suicides?â€™â€™ he asked.

4,'Attempt to split a party is no crime',"LUCKNOW: Justice NK Mehrotra of the high court here on Tuesday, while dismissing a criminal revision filed by the state government relating to state Guest House episode of 1995, ruled that the attempt for a split of a political party was not an offence and affirmed the verdict of the sessions court.

The state had preferred a criminal revision against the order of the special judge, Prevention of Corruption Act, observing that no case under the Act against Mulayam Singh Yadav and 11 others was made out.

The special judge had sent the record to the magistrate concerned to initiate proceedings against the accused under other provisions of the Indian Penal Code.

Dismissing the state revision, the high court observed that ""by an overall assessment of the evidence collected during investigation, at the most, it appears that it was an attempt for split in the Bahujan Samaj Party and, as said above, the attempt for a ''split'' of a political party is not an offence and, therefore, there can be no question of conspiracy.""

It may be recalled that the Guest House episode happened in 1995 in which the BSP, a ruling alliance partner, withdrew support from the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. In reaction, Mulayam Singh Yadav allegedly called Raj Bahadur to form their government by any means. On June 2, 1995 in pursuance of the common objective 300 to 400 Samajwadi Party MLAs, workers, office- bearers and others proceeded to the State Guest House and abducted five MLAs and produced them before Mulayam Singh Yadav and other co-accused. It was alleged that they were offered money, threatened and made to sign documents.

5,Cong blames govt staff for Rajasthan rout,"NEW DELHI: When the Congressâ€™ central screening committee meets on Wednesday to determine how many of the sitting MPs from Rajasthan should be renominated, it may also ponder on what went wrong in the December assembly polls.

According to the feedback from Jaipur, the Congressâ€™ dismal loss has been blamed primarily on two factors: government employees and the Jat community. This is contained in a factsheet the AICC received on 60 constituencies that the party lost by less than 10,000 votes.

In the 200-member assembly, the Congress won just 56 seats. Out of the 60 seats the party zeroed-in, it lost 15 because of angry Jats and aggrieved government employees. In the remaining 45, the defeat was entirely blamed on the employees.

The diagnosis addresses real issues unlike routine post-mortem of defeats which merely doles out excuses. However, it also points to the task that awaits the Congress because the Vasundhara Raje government seems to have appeased the government employees for the moment, and continues to aggressively woo the Jats.

6,Union-wary govt ignores flab,"KOLKATA: A staggering 333 people in every department of the West Bengal government, on an average, just carry files, fetch drinking water and occasionally tea and coffee!

According to a survey conducted by the state government, about 25 per cent of the employees in every department are excess as they have hardly any work to do. Almost all of them belong to the lower most levels of group D and group C.

But under pressure from the unions, the government has coined a politically correct term to describe these employees.

The survey has suggested calling them â€˜redeployableâ€™ employees, who will form a pool from which their services will be asked for as and when any department requires them.

While the government is desperate to shed flab off its administrative structure, the job will not be easy as most of these group D employees are not only members of the CPM-backed Coordination Committee, but also active party workers in many cases.

The survey revealed that about 18,000 group D and 17,000 group C employees were manning a total of 54 departments. Though 25 departments are yet to submit details about their exact staff strength and its justification, the overall estimate pointed out that 25 per cent of the staff was redundant.

The report also mentioned that the majority of these employees were appointed in ""a haste"" without evaluating the need and in many cases the appointments were not required.

""Appointments were without rationalisation, making the structure bottom-heavy. Maximum irrational intakes were at the lower most levels of group D and group C because of political compulsions,"" said a senior departmental official.

""After evaluating 29 departments, we found that about 4,000 employees were absolutely extra even after having a very relaxed margin and a flexible set of criteria,"" informed another official. ""Now we see that there will be no requirement for appointments in the near future,"" observed a senior employee. With computerisation and digital filing on the cards, many more employees will lose their utility.

At the top levels of group A and B though, there was need for more people, the report observed. The Co-ordination Committee declared that it would oppose the move. ""We will oppose anything which is against the interest of the employees,"" said committee secretary Smarajit Roychoudhury.

7,Pressure on DF govt for dissolution,"NEW DELHI: The BJP and the Shiv Sena will increase the pressure on the Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra to dissolve the assembly so that elections can be held simultaneously in the state.

Party sources said, â€˜â€˜We will whip up the agitation and try and compel the state government to have both elections together.â€™â€™

The logic for this, BJP sources said, is that while it feels that it will, along with the Sena, wrest the state in the assembly elections from the Congress-NCP combine, it is not sure about winning a majority of the Lok Sabha seats.

By holding both elections together, it hopes that the impact of the assembly elections will help it with the Lok Sabha seats as well.

In the Congress-NCP combine, while the NCP is opposed to dissolving the state assembly, the Congress is divided.

8,"Tense govt steels march, cuts duty","NEW DELHI: Worried by the political implications of rising steel prices, the government on Tuesday cut import duty on non-alloy steel products by five percentage points to 15 per cent from 20 per cent.

This is the second time since January that the government has slashed the duty on steel. In the mini-budget, import duty on steel had been cut from 30 to 20 per cent.

The latest duty cut followed last weekâ€™s price hike of Rs 2,000-4,000 a tonne by domestic producers. High domestic steel prices could have forced user industries to hike prices of finished products, including tractors and bicycles. This would not have gone down well with rural voters and farmers.

Also, at a time when the government is encouraging housing and construction in a big way, high domestic steel prices are turning out to be a major problem. Construction steel â€” wire rods, for instance â€” is up from about Rs 15 a kg in June-July 2003 to Rs 26 a kg now.

The government hopes domestic producers would roll back prices to some extent as the landed cost of imported steel would be lower than prevailing domestic prices. â€˜â€˜Domestic steel producers, it has been noticed, have been pegging domestic prices to the landed cost of imported steel,â€™â€™ an official said.

9,More people go hungry under Vajpayee govt: Cong,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday cited an FAO report to allege that the number of people going hungry or undernourished has increased during the Vajpayee government''s rule.

Citing the UN agency''s report, ""The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2003"", party''s spokesman on economic issues, Jairam Ramesh, said these were a few other ""shining"" examples of the NDA government, which claimed that there were abundant food stocks in the country.

""Prime Minister Vajpayee''s legacy is not just mounting unemployment but also growing hunger and undernourishment,"" he alleged.

The international agency''s report has stated that the number of hungry people in India has increased after 1996-97.

The report states, ""After seeing a decline of 20 million in the number of undernourished people between 1990-92 and 1996-97, the number of hungry people in India increased by 19 million over the following years.""

Ramesh contended that the FAO report confirmed what the Congress had all along been saying with regard to the economic health and growing poverty in India.

According to the FAO report, China shines in contrast to India, having ""reduced the number of hungry people by 58 million since the World Food Summit baseline period (1990-92)"".

Ramesh said that in the last three years, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had written over 10 letters to Vajpayee on food security and suggested specific steps for dealing with them, but there had been no response to her letters.

The NDA government also did not respond favourably to the suggestions made by the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states about the nation-wide rural employment guarantee scheme using surplus food stocks, he said, adding food stocks were piling up simply because people purchased less from ration shops.
