0,"450 trucks, buses impounded","HOSHIARPUR: The district administration, especially the transport department, on Wednesday evening impounded more than 450 trucks, private buses and light commercial vehicles (LCV) to mobilise crowd for Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singhâ€™s scheduled function in Gurdaspur district.

The transport department left no stone uncovered as various truck unions, private bus operators and private owners of LCVs were forced to put at disposal their vehicles to Congress leaders so as to enable them to mark their loyalty to the chief minister. Trucks and buses were impounded from Hoshiarpur, Dasuya, Mukerian and otherA parts of the district.

Scores of buses and trucks could be seen parked opposite the Police Lines in the Civil Line area on Wednesday evening. A truck operator said that they were not even offered money for the fuel. A transporter said that drivers who were self-employed were the worst hit as it was difficult for them to bear costs and go without business as well.

He added that truck owners and private bus owners always became scapegoats whenever any rally of the ruling party was in the offing. The transport department forcibly takes vehicles from them anytime people have to be mobilised for rallies, he said.

He said that on Tuesday some of the bus and truck operators were forced to send buses to Patiala and Longowal in Sangrur district for the chief ministerâ€™s rally.

2,FIR filed against lawyer accused of kidnapping,"VADODARA: The City police station registered an FIR against Vadodara advocate Gopal Ramani over allegations of kidnapping for ransom, extortion, robbery and forgery. Vedprakash Melumal Arya, a businessman whose brother was allegedly kidnapped, filed the FIR. The advocate, his son Jayesh, and five others have been named as accused.

The FIR states that Ramani abducted Vedprakash''s brother Kanaiyalal on May 20 and seized possession of his shops as Vedprakash could not repay a loan taken from Ramani. Earlier, Vedprakash had filed a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court against the City police station officials for not registering a complaint against Ramani.

Commenting on the issue, Ramani said, â€œThe complaint is registered to defame me and my family. Vedprakash and Kanaiyalal came in touch with me in August-September 1996 when they used to run a tea shop. Vedprakash and his brother began lending money by borrowing from the open market in Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Halol and Surat. A lot of people did not pay back their money, and both brothers filed at least 25 cases under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, through me.â€�

Ramani further said that Arya had borrowed money from him, but they were not supposed to pay interest as they had developed good relations with him. However, Arya had given him an interest of Rs 3 lakh by cheque at the rate of 1 per cent for six months, he added.

Earlier, Vedprakash had claimed that Ramani had taken signatures of his brothers and relatives on blank stamp papers and blank cheques.

However, Ramani said, â€œI did not take any signatures on blank stamp papers and cheques. As they were not able to repay the loans, both the brothers came to me on May 2, 2003 and sold the shop at City Point to one Govindlal Bajaj and the other two shops to my brother, with all documents. The brothers had given me a cheque of Rs 10 lakh for the remaining amount, but it bounced.â€�

About the allegations of the kidnapping of Kanaiyalal, Ramani said, â€œVedprakash had come to my office on May 20 and told me that his brother had left the shop at 4.30 pm saying that I had sent a bearded person to call him. I told him then that I had not called his brother. I came to know that Kanaiyalal had fled the city owing to his debts.â€� Ramani added that he had all the documents with him to prove his innocence.

3,Counselling can quell suicides among young,"HYDERABAD: Counselling can bring down the number of suicides among the young. This must involve collective approach at the community level.

In about 75 per cent of the cases, the young commit suicide either due to frustration over failure in exams, career or life. The present day education system, that is getting increasingly competitive, is also highly demanding on the individual. ""If more jobs are created by the government and various job-oriented courses are offered, students will not face stress,"" Christian Counselling Centre director Dr B J Prashantam told reporters on Wednesday.

The suicide rate in Andhra Pradesh is about 12 per cent, while it is 15 per cent in Kerala. ""Counselling can solve personal problems, be it in the case of drug abuse, alcoholism or neglected HIV patients,"" he said.

4,Friday is a bad day for polls: Asad,"HYDERABAD: The MIM is likely to petition the chief electoral officer (CEO) to change the date for the Karwan assembly by-election, currently slated for September 26, a Friday.

The ECâ€™s poll date has also surprised the state administration. The local authorities have not yet completed issuing photo-identity cards to voters in Karwan.

The MIM leaders are likely to meet the CEO and present a memorandum to him detailing the reasons for postponing the elections and a copy will also be sent to the Election Commission, Majlis leader Asaduddin Owaisi told The Times of India.

Nearly 50 per cent of the constituency are Muslim voters, who would require about two hours for their Friday prayers and the Majlis leader says this would affect the polling process. ""The entire election exercise is to see that genuine voters cast their votes and maximum number of people participate in the process. The Friday prayers would impede the polling,"" Owaisi Jr. said.

However, it is the prerogative of the Election Commission to finalise the dates for polling, the MIM leader said.

He also contended that the Peopleâ€™s Representation Act should be suitably amended to prevent a by-election after the death of a sitting candidate.

""His or her nominee should be allowed to continue till the end of the Assembly or parliamentary term, as the people have already given a mandate to the candidate to continue for the rest of the term,"" Owaisi said.

The state administrationâ€™s surprise at the by-poll date comes even though the EC is not under any obligation to take its consent before finalising election dates. However, it was believed that the commission would hold informal consultations with the state election authorities.

5,Raichur bandh partial,"RAICHUR: The Raichur bandh, called by Janata Dal (S) on Thursday against the governmentâ€™s â€œfailure to maintain the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canalâ€™â€™, was partially successful. Shops and business establishment downed shutters for a few hours. While the bandh affected public transporation, schools and colleges were spared.

The protesters, led by former minister Muniyappa Muddappa, took out a rally from Dr Dr Ambedkar Circle to the deputy commissionerâ€™s office. District JD (S) president Rizwan, farmer leader Nageshwar Rao and nearly 200 farmers participated in the march.

They submitted a memorandum to the DC, addressed to the CM, seeking compensation to farmers who had suffered crop loss due to overflow of canal water.

Protesters sought the release of water to the canal at the earliest and uninterrupted power to farmers for irrigating their lands to grow alternative crops.

Forum for farmers: Raichur Zilla Raithara Hitarakshana Vedike, an apolitical forum, has been formed under the leadership of former minister M.S. Patil to protect the rights of farmers. Patil is also the state president of Lok Jana Shakti. Members of the forum on Thursday staged a dharna before the DCâ€™s office for water.

Patil said the dharna was against the â€œinjustice caused to the tail-end farmers of Tungabhadra Left Bank Canalâ€™â€™.

He and his followers demanded that the government either establish a new and separate board to be named Tungabhadra Jala Bhagya Nigama and provide uninterrupted power to farmers. He appealed to the people to join the dharna.

â€˜Cong not to blameâ€™: A. Vasanth Kumar, the chairman of urban development authority, said the Congress was not responsible for the breach in the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal at Mile 41. He told reporters that on learning about the breach, elected representatives rushed to the spot, took steps to prevent leakage and held discussions with water resources minister H.K. Patil and irrigation engineers.

6,Cloud-seeding too late for Hubli farmers,"HUBLI: Too little, too late â€” that is the common reaction to reports that the government plans to pilot into the clouds and cause them to burst into rain. For, the standing kharif crop has almost withered away.

Encouraged by predictions of a good monsoon this year, farmers in the district set about sowing the kharif crop.

Most of the crops sown at the beginning of June, when the monsoon rain began, have crossed the growth stage and dried up due to insufficient rain in July and August. June was a good month in terms of rain, but in June and July, all five taluks of Dharwad district have received meagre rainfall, and crop failure is almost certain.

Statistics show that there was 91.6 mm of rain in Dharwad taluk in June, slightly below the normal of 102.6 mm. It went down drastically in July, with 44.3 mm of rain recorded against the expected 183.8 mm, and only 9.4 mm till August 17. In Hubli taluk, rainfall in June was 111.3 mm (normal 85.8 mm), July -40.2 mm (expected 120.4 mm), and only 1.5 mm in August.

Looking at these figures, the agriculture department has predicted 100 per cent crop failure. Only 61 per cent sowing has been recorded, with farmers putting their hope into soya, jowar, groundnut, green gram, cotton and paddy.

The worst affected have been Navalgund and Kundgol taluks where only 8-10 per cent sowing has been recorded. In Kalghatgi too, where paddy was sown, crops have withered.

Crops have crossed the growing stage and are drying up, no one can bring them back to life, remarked an agriculture officer. Paddy, soya, groundnut and cotton need adequate water at the growing stage. Late rain can revive only the jowar, he felt.

â€œI canâ€™t believe that aeroplanes can bring rain. If the plane is coming here, it is too late to save our crop,â€� said Shivappa Hirekerur, a farmer in Hubli taluk who is fascinated by reports on the cloud-seeding operation.

However, farmer Bhimappa feels that science can work miracles. For him, spending a few crores on cloud seeding is worth it. â€œLast year, we struggled even to get clean water at the peak of summer. If the plane can fill up even half the village tank, it will be a great relief,â€� he felt.

Whatever may be the results of cloud seeding, farmers in the stranglehold of drought for three years are looking to the skies to take care of at least fodder for their cattle.

7,Bangla bandh disrupts life,"KOLKATA: Normal life was disrupted in Kolkata on Thursday because of a 24-hour West Bengal bandh called by the Socialist Unity Centre of India. The CPI(M-L) Liberation issued a parallel bandh call during the day.

Shops and markets were mostly closed in the city and traffic on the roads was thin. State buses and trams plied in large numbers; some private buses and mini buses also operated. Taxis were, however, absent from the roads. Schools and colleges were mostly closed. Though bank branches were open, there were hardly any customers. Train services were disrupted in the Sealdah South section.

The SUCI had called the bandh against ""anti-people measures of the ruling Left Front"", like increasing hospital charges, electricity tariff and tuition fees in colleges and the introduction of capitation fees in medical education. Buoyed by the response to the bandh, the SUCI threatened to call a bandh extending from 48 to 72 hours after the Pujas. A total of 158 persons were arrested in the city for obstructing traffic.

The arrests were at Hazra crossing, Shyambazar five-point crossing and Lenin Sarani-Madan Street crossing and Dorina crossing, according to DC (headquarters) Kuldeip Singh. According the DIG (HQ) Narayan Ghosh more than 1,337 people were arrested in the districts. About six policemen were also injured in scuffles with the SUCI activists who were trying to enforce the bandh. The state secretariat at Writers'' Building and New Secretariats wore almost a deserted look even before the lunch break. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had a normal working day, ignored the bandh and refused to comment on it. Bandh opponents claimed 65-70 per cent attendance in Writers'' and the New Secretariat.

In districts, the police reported 60-80 per cent attendance in government offices and industrial areas. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, however , virtually admitted that the bandh was a success albeit for a different reason. ""After the macabre killing of some bus passengers on the day of a Congress-sponsored bandh in 1981, people are scared of venturing out irrespective of whoever calls the bandh,'''' said the minister. According to him, 150 extra state buses plied on the city roads in the morning. Some private buses also came out on the streets.

But some of the buses were withdrawn as there were few passengers. SUCI leader Probhash Ghosh accused the police and CPM cadres of outraging the modesty of women during the bandh. ""There have been 1,285 arrests across the state and 44 people, many of them seriously, have been injured in lathicharges. At Hazra crossing, policemen outraged the modesty of women SUCI workers and tore their clothes in the presence of a deputy commissioner,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Mandya deputy commissioner B.P.Kanhiram said, K.N. Ramesh, the 24-year old youth from Mandya district, who committed suicide on August 19, did not end his life due to loans piling up.

In a release in Bangalore on Thursday, the commissioner said in a report to the government that neither Ramesh nor his father Ninge Gowda had borrowed loans for agricultural purposes.

â€œIn fact, the father told the inspection committee, his son did not have any land in his name. Since Rameshâ€™s suicide cannot be construed as a farmerâ€™s suicide, his family will be not eligible for compensation,â€™â€™ the release said.

10,New guidelines in negligence arrests,"NEW DELHI: As the Delhi Police recently violated the Lieutenant governorâ€™s directive on how to arrest a doctor in medical negligence cases, the high court on Thursday decided to form guidelines for lower judiciary as well as the police to deal with such cases.

The bench of chief justice B C Patel and justice A K Sikri said the matter was of great concern. They noted that if the police continued with their present action, the doctors would not be forthcoming in helping the law enforcement agency.

Three doctors, Rajneesh Kukreja, Monica Bhagat and Dinkar Chawla were arrested last month. The police charged them with a non-bailable offence and alleged that their negligence had caused a patientâ€™s death.

The charges were levelled despite a detailed report of Delhi Medical Council stating that the case was that of medical negligence where even the police could grant bail.

The arrests were also violative since the prime accused had been granted anticipatory bail last year. Also the cause of death reamined unkown since no autopsy was done by police. Senior advocate K T S Tulsi argued before the high court: â€˜â€˜Under the Supreme Court guidelines, doctors are bound to accept accident victims. If the police continues to behave like this, no doctor would help .â€™â€™

An officer said:â€˜â€˜When a doctor was arrested two years ago, the L-G had said that since police are not experts, medical negligence cases should be referred to principal secretary (health) . On councilâ€™s suggestion, the police should register a case.â€™â€™

12,TTEs told to report ugly incidents to headquarters,"DANAPUR: The Railways have stepped up security in all long-distance trains, especially Rajdhani Express trains, and all the divisions of the Northern and East Central railway zones have been put on alert to prevent incidents of misbehaviour by VIP passengers with fellow travellers.

The move follows the publication of a letter of a US-based professor, Subrata Bhattacharjee, in The Times of India on August 20, narrating how the journey of the professor and his family by the Rajdhani Express turned into a nightmare due to alleged misbehaviour of a Bihar minister and his aides.

Senior divisional commercial manager (DCM), Danapur division, A K Singh said the railway security personnel and staff deployed in the AC coaches of Rajdhani Express trains have been directed to keep a close watch on the activities of â€œVIP passengersâ€� and immediately report incidents of uncouth behaviour and nuisance in the running trains to the headquarters of the division through which the train is passing during the incident.

â€œWe are committed to checking such nuisance in running trains,â€� he said, adding if the situation does not improve, the Railways may hand over the security in Rajdhani Express to RPSF commandos. Sources recalled the Eastern Railway headquarters had once introduced commandos in Rajdhani Express after a Bihar MP and his men allegedly misbehaved with some women passengers in the train. The arrangement was later withdrawn as it proved costly, the sources said, adding the Railways may deploy the commandos on a regular basis.

13,"Xinhua report on Sikkim is flawed, says MEA","NEW DELHI: Dubbing a Chinese state-owned Xinhua news agency report mentioning Sikkim as a separate country as totally ``flawed'''', New Delhi on Thursday asserted that Sikkim is an integral part of India and this could not be altered by anyone.

``Understandings reached during Prime Minister Vajpayee''s recent visit to China have started the process by which Sikkim will cease to be an issue in Sino-India relations...Naturally, this will happen through various steps,'''' the external affairs ministry spokesperson said.

He was responding to questions about the Xinhua report from Tibet which said ``sharing long borders with a number of neighbouring Asian countries like Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Myanmar, Tibet boasts geographical advantages in expanding border trade''''.

The spokesperson said, ``It is obviously a flawed report which does not even include India in the list of neighbouring countries of China bordering Tibet.''''

During Vajpayee''s visit to China in June, the two countries had signed a border trade protocol to add a trading point in Sikkim, by which Indian officials said the north-eastern state will cease to be an issue in Sino-India relations.

Apart from nominated members -- Kuldip Nayar, Shabana Azmi, Raja Ramana, Choudhry Harmohan Singh, KS Duggal and C Narayan Reddy -- for whom it was the last day of their term, only AIADMK members were present in the house.

Replying to a question from Azmi, HRD Minister MM Joshi said government is concerned over large dropouts of girl students in rural schools and is planning to introduce handicraft, music and vocational course alongside the regular curricula to arrest the trend.

He said as per the national sample survey organisation 1999-2000, the Muslim female literacy rate in the country is 62.2 per cent for urban areas and 42.1 per cent for rural areas.

Minister of state for HRD Sanjay Paswan said the government targeted retaining girl students by 2008 through various programmes at the elementary level.

Replying to another question about extradition of Union Carbide''s former chief Warren Anderson, minister of state for chemicals Chhatra Pal Singh told the Upper house that government has forwarded the request. He reiterated that government has no intention to end the case.

Minister of state for Railways Bandaru Dattatreya told Upper house that the government is not contemplating any scheme for laying separate tracks for ordinary and superfast trains.

He also told the house that a bill to give more powers to the Railway Protection Force is in the advanced stage of consideration. The bill proposes to give RPF more policing powers to address the problems of passengers.

The amendment proposes to bring within its ambit 29 offences which is presently vested with state governments. In reply to another query, the minister said during 2002, 71,406 persons were prosecuted for unauthorised vending and Rs 1.62 crore was realised from them.

15,Poor Gujarat riots compensation shocking: Justices,"AHMEDABAD: Justice Nanavati and Justice Shah, who are hearing complaints from victims of last year''s Gujarat riots, expressed surprise and shock on Friday when a woman resident of Shahpur complained that she had been handed over a cheque of only Rs 100 by the state government as compensation for property losses, as against actual losses of around Rs 4 lakh.

The complaint was made by Mehrunnissa Shaikh, a resident of Shahpur Darwaza during a hearing on Friday. She said that she was not given even an explanation as to why the compensation was so disproportionate to actual losses.

The two judges expressed shock and surprise over the complaint and directed the district collector to inquire into the matter and report on how such pittance could be given as compensation when the complainant said the losses were much higher.

Another victim, Ghulam Moinuddin Saiyed, a resident of Mirzapur said that while the riots began in late February, his locality was completely quiet till April 22 when a new police inspector, who was posted in the area, started inciting trouble.

Saiyed said that police resorted to indiscriminate firing without provocation and booked false cases against the residents.

He added that after he complained to police commissioner K R Kaushik and then security adviser to the chief minister, K P S Gill, the police booked him in false cases despite the fact that his son and son-in-law were themselves injured in police firing.

Saiyed alleged that the police acted in vengeance because of his complaint and even had him externed from the district.

About 70 people turned up on Friday from Shahpur and Madhopura police station areas to depose before the commission as their statements could not be recorded during the first two phases due to time constraint.

Talking to mediapersons, the state CPI secretary Joginder Dayal expressed regret over the manner in which the state government dealt with Union minister of state for external affairs Vinod Khanna and his supporters in Gurdaspur over the inauguration of a bridge.

Dayal said the chief minister had created a similar situation by disallowing UP Chief Minister Mayawati from organising the public rally in the state on the Talhan episode.

He said the chief minister''s attitude had infact strengthened his opponents in the SAD and the BJP.

Dayal said the state was fast developing symptoms of pre-militancy days when unemployment had been on the rise and law and order situation was badly crippled.

He dismissed the state government''s anti-corruption campaign as a futile exercise saying that corruption had infact increased in the in the government offices. Dayal said the Vigilance department was not performing its task well. He demanded an inquiry in corruption cases.

The mandals can collect an application form from the respective health department offices in the district, and the last date of submission is fixed at August 31, Pardeshi said, pointing out the participating mandals will have to use the anti-HIV campaign as a theme in the decorations of the pandals.

On the other hand, Maharashtra food and drug administration minister Anil Deshmukh said that all mandals have been requested to lend a helping hand to the government''s efforts in its anti-gutka campaign.
