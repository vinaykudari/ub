0,"Free power to farmers, at what cost?","HYDERABAD: Come Tuesday and the brand new government of the Congress will know just how much money it will have to put in where its mouth is with reference to providing free electricity to farmers. The AP Electricity Regulatory Commission was on Monday engaged in a comprehensive exercise of calculating just how many crores of rupees the state government will have to provide as additional subsidy that needs to be paid to power companies in return for the free power to farmers.

The government expects that it would have to provide for anywhere up to Rs 450 crore for waiver of power supply bills to the agriculture sector while it has to provide for anywhere around another Rs 1250 crore after it wrote of existing dues.

An APERC official said on Monday that the commission would send its response to a letter from the government seeking directions to the power companies on the government decision to waive power bills from farmers. The government letter, dated May 14 to the APERC, asked the commission to issue the directions with respect to all agricultural consumers, irrigation and agricultural consumers (HT-IV) category and all Rural Electricity Supply Cooperative Societies.

1,TRS eyeing 3 ministerial berths,"HYDERABAD: Taking a U-turn from its earlier stand of not joining the state Congress ministry, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is likely to demand for a couple of ministerial berths much to the embarrassment of chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy.

The TRS chief K Chandrashekhar Rao is under pressure from the party legislators to take up ministerships in the state. This may cause inconvenience to the Rajasekhara Reddy who is not inclined to head a government with the participation of the TRS for obvious reasons. However, the Congress high command and the party''s state in charge Ghulam Nabi Azad have invited the TRS to join the governments at the state and centre.

The TRS leadership had promised its legislators that they would be accommodated in the new legislative council after it is revived and other nominated posts, to keep them in good humour. But they were particular about the ministerial berths in the state.

The party legislators were a disappointed lot when Chandrashekhara Rao announced that the TRS would not join the state government. The party chief had faced internal criticism for his decision. The TRS chief also came under attack from his functionaries for opting to join the union cabinet, but keeping away from state ministry.

The party is likely to ask for three ministerial berths and also demand for nominated posts of various assembly committees and eying for deputy speakership in the state.

Ghanpur MLA K Vijayarama Rao, from scheduled caste community who had defeated TDPs K Srihari is one of the front runner for ministerial berth, party sources said.

T Padma Rao and Nayani Narasimha Reddy (from Secunderabad and Musheerabad assembly segments) are also in the fray. For other posts, one legislator each from Mahabubnagar and Nalgonda are in the race, it is learnt. Also, five party legislators have already rushed to Delhi to lobby for berths.

The TRS parliamentary party meeting to be held on Tuesday would ''officially'' take a decision on joining the Union cabinet, sources said. The party is expected to get one ministry at the centre and Chandrashekhar Rao is the obvious choice. A Narendra, who had won from Medak Lok Sabha segment is tipped to become the party''s floor leader.

2,Umbrella Akali Dal before SGPC polls?,"PATIALA: Dissidents of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) may form a new Akali Dal before the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) elections, which are scheduled to be held on July 11.

Former MP and a dissident, Tarlochan Singh Tur, who had contested the recently held Lok Sabha election from Tarn Taran seat against the official candidate of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal),while talking to the TNN, said that soon a new party of ""true Akalis"" would be formed and its candidates would be fielded in the SGPC elections.

Tur said, ""In fact, we want to bring all the Akali factions, except SAD (Badal), on a common platform and revive the â€˜real'' Akali Dal under the leadership of dedicated Akali leaders, like Prem Singh Lalpura or Surjan Singh Thekedar. The former MP said that talks were being initiated with leaders of the SAD (A), Ravi Inder''s faction, Barnala group members, including Baldev Singh Mann, senior Akali leader Inderjit Singh Jira, former Union minister Balwant Singh Ramoowalia and other like-minded people, who wanted to revive the great spirit and tradition of the Akali Dal.

SAD (Badal) president Parkash Singh Badal, responding to a question here on Monday, said that formation of the ""bogus"" Akali Dal was a part of Congress'' gameplan. Talking about Mann, Ravi Inder and other small Akali Dals, he said that they were agents of the Congress government, working against the interests of the panth.

About the SGPC elections, he said that the SAD (Badal) was ready to contest and would again prove that it was the real Akali Dal.

Former SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar, while talking to the TNN here on Monday, said that the Congress was backing Tur and others. After the shameful defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the Punjab chief minister could go to any extent against the SAD (Badal), he said, adding that in November 2002, at the time of election of the SGPC president, he had left no stone unturned to harass the SAD SGPC members by imposing section 144 in the state.

He said that the people who were playing in the hands of the Congress should keep in mind that they had already been rejected by the people in the LS elections.

However, Tur has denied the charges that the Congress was behind their move. He said that their only mission was to free the SGPC from the clutches of Badal, who had tarnished the image of Akalis by indulging in large-scale corruption.

4,Joining govt: Pawar faces dilemma,"MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar is facing a dilemma whether to join the Congress-led coalition at the Centre or support it from outside.

According to sources, the NCP working committee has already decided to support the Sonia Gandhi -led government notwi thstanding its opposition to persons of foreign origin occupying high offices.

A section in the party felt that ""Saheb"" should not join the government since the NCP was formed on the issue of not allowing the people of foreign origin to hold high offices, including that of President and PrimeMinister.Also, by extending support from outside the party will not forfeit its right to criticise the new dispensation.

However, another section is credited with the view that the foreign origin issue has been buried by the electorate whichhas voted in Sonia''s favour. Hence, the NCP should join the government.

Also because the NCP has been running a coalition government in the state with the Congress for close to five years and had fought the LS polls jointly. Senior CPM Harkishan Singh Surjit is putting pressure on Pawar to join the government to ensure stability.

NCPgeneral secretary Gurunath Kulkarni said: ""Pawar is a seasoned administrator and he will prove an asset to Sonia Gandhi in running the coalition.However, it is for Pawar to take a decision in this regard.""

Meanwhile, Pawar has rubbished RPI leader Ramdas Athavale''s request that he (Pawar) be made deputy Prime Minister. Athavale called on Sonia Gandhi on Sunday and put forth this demand. ""Who authorised Athavale to raise this demand?

I have not authorised him or anybody else for that matter to speak on my behalf. In any case, we are not beggars,"" Pawar told TNN on Sunday evening.

5,Sangh farmers' body says Modi must go,"GANDHINAGAR: The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), the Sangh Parivar''s farmers'' wing, has asked BJP leadership to sack CM Narendra Modi.

In a statement issued here at the end of the BKS'' Gujarat state committee meeting held to review LS elections, general secretary Maganbhai Patel said: ""Modi''s ego has been the main reason for BJP''s poor showing.""

Among the reasons given for BJP''s defeat are: ""Modi''s repugnant utterances, anonymous advertisements, show off during festivals, flaunting of public money to gather crowds, anti-rural mindset and false promises.""

Pointing out that all this has boomeranged, Patel, who is considered close to former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, said: ""Modi has even lost the right to resign on moral grounds. He should be just dumped. This is the collective demand of BKS. And this should be done understanding people''s feelings, and particularly that of Gujarat farmers.""

6,New govt will have its hands full on labour,"NEW DELHI: When the labour ministry staff bid farewell to outgoing minister Sahib Singh Verma on Monday evening, they readied themselves for significant changes in policy under a Congress-led government.

The Left parties, that have decided not to join the government but give outside support, have already indicated that they would like the new government to have a pro-labour face.

""We want an effective role of the labour ministry in favour of labour. In this context, we will put pressure on the government to withdraw the hire-and-fire policy,"" CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta, who won the Panskura LS seat from West Bengal, said on Monday.

He said his party along with other Left parties would ensure that the labour ministry makes laws for unorganised sector and and raised funds for their welfare.

Although the Left and Congress have had similar stands in parliament on labour-related issues, there could be disagreement between the two.

There is an impression that Left would assert its ideological identity while Congress has already expressed itself in favour of economic reforms.

Again in the field of labour reforms, the Congress-led government may face some opposition from the Left parties which may insist that firms should seek the government''s permission before they go in for closure or retrenchment under the Labour Disputes Act.

7,Left to stay out of govt,"NEW DELHI: The Left parties announced on Monday that they would not join the Congress-led government, but extend unconditional support from outside to foil BJP''s attempts to destabilise it.

Many were wishing the Left would join the government, if only in the hope that its presence in the government would make it more restrained in its statements and demands and this, in turn, would be a stabilising factor for the regime.

But far from joining the government, the Left - CPM, CPI and Forward Bloc - has not even decided whether it will sign the common minimum programme (CMP).

Addressing a joint press conference, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and CPI chief A B Bardhan said the first draft of the CMP would be prepared by Congress with reference to the election manifestoes of the Left parties.

After Manmohan Singh prepares the draft in a couple of days, it would be circulated among the Left parties for their inputs. The Left would consider signing it only after seeing the final version, Surjeet said.

He was non-committal on the issue of being part of any coordination mechanism. CPM politburo member Prakash Karat said this could be decided only after seeing the CMP.

Many leaders feel there is no point in being part of the CMP drafting and coordination committees because by remaining outside, the Left would not be able to implement its agenda in the government.

The primary reason why CPM has decided to stay out of the government is not to get associated with Congress and not to grant the opposition space to the BJP.

This being the overriding concern, CPM may think twice before joining the coordination mechanism of the Congress-led alliance. At the same time, by remaining outside the government, the Left would use every opportunity to further its agenda.

The Left parties'' decision to stay out was largely guided by CPM because CPI had announced on Monday morning that though it wanted to join the government, it would abide by CPM''s decision.

This was a clear case of ""pressure tactics"" as the earlier understanding was that both the parties would announce a joint decision and CPI knew well that CPM is not keen to participate in the government.

Also, the CPI announced a sub-committee to prepare the CMP when the CPM is in no hurry to formalise any consultative mechanism with Congress.

But CPM did not succumb to the pressure from its ideological ally and by Monday afternoon, its Central Committee arrived at its decision with an overwhelming majority against the Congress'' invitation.

According to sources, there was no real voting to clinch the issue, but a mere raising of hands by the CC members. The number of members in favour of joining was so few that the raised hands were not counted.

""They could have been around 20-odd members,"" sources said.

The fourth Left party, RSP decided not to openly support the Congress. In the guise of more meetings, RSP general secretary K Pankajakshan and others also kept away from the joint Left press conference.

8,SP to join govt as Left nominee,"NEW DELHI: The Samajwadi Party on Monday indicated its willingness to join the Congress-led coalition government and clarified that it was doing so only at the instance of the Left.

In its letter to President Kalam, SP clarified that they were supporting the Sonia government on the ""advice"" of CPM boss Harkishen Singh Surjeet for forming a ""secular"" government.

What was odd that, unlike other supporting parties, SP chose to give the letter of support directly to the President instead of Sonia Gandhi.

This is being seen as an attempt to draw a distance from Congress even while being its partner in government, and as a virtual nominee of the Left.

The explanation of Mulayam''s lieutenant, Amar Singh, that they submitted the letter to the President because they were not carrying it when they had gone for Sonia''s dinner on Sunday evening failed to wash with many for the simple reason that he might have very well called on Sonia with the letter instead of going to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Singh''s press conference also reinforced the belief that Surjeet was pushing for SP''s inclusion in the government so that the Left could have proxy power in the government. Amar Singh reinforced the impression by doing a neat U-turn on disinvestment.

While SP has never been known to have ideological opposition to disinvestment - Mulayam Singh sold the state-owned Dalla cement factory much before privatisation became part of the political lexicon - Singh on Monday spoke of his party''s opposition to selloffs.

The shift was also reflected in Singh''s reappraisal of the former disinvestment minister Arun Shourie with the SP leader calling him an ""economic terrorist.""

Not long ago, the UP government had invited Shourie along with Arun Jaitley - another member of the Vajpayee cabinet championing reforms initiatives - to tutor party MLAs and bureaucrats on the nuances of economic governance.

9,Financial markets safe for investment: SEBI,"MUMBAI: Market regulator SEBI on Tuesday asserted that Indian financial markets were safe for investing and there was no payment crisis on the bourses.

""We held a meeting this morning to review settlement problem and risk management. To our mind, there is no problem in settlement,"" SEBI chairman G N Bajpai said here.

SEBI also ruled out operation of any bear cartel in the fall of the Sensex on Monday.

""Our data does not state any market misconduct. If anyone is found guilty (of market misconduct), we will take action,"" he said.

""Indian financial markets are very safe for investors,"" he said.

Bajpai said the markets were safe for investing and ""there was no need to panic"".

The strong message from SEBI saw the revival on the stock markets with the BSE Sensex spurting by 196 points, or 4.45 per cent, at 4701.13 while the wide-base NSE rose by 65 points, or 4.68 per cent, at 1453.40 in the first 30 minutes of trading.

Domestic and overseas investors, he said, responded to the market sentiments on political uncertainty over reforms.

""We do not advise investors to invest or not to invest (during particular periods). Our concern is how safe the markets are and we believe there is nothing to worry about. Indian financial markets are very safe and sound,"" he said.

Bajpai did not find any fault with the broking community and said ""so far the data doesn''t show any misconduct. There is no settlement crisis.""

10,FIIs see Red on political horizon and flee,"AHMEDABAD: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who fuelled and rode the India Shining'' hype, have knocked the daylights out of the stock markets in the last three trading sessions since the results of the Lok Sabha elections poured in last Thursday.

High crude oil prices was just a fringe reason for Monday''s meltdown. Confronted with a Communist-controlled government in New Delhi, the FIIs have simply decided to bolt. While the long-term FIIs have still desisted from selling, the hedge funds are taking the first flight home after seeing ''Red'' on the horizon. It is estimated that hedge funds have invested around Rs 4000-5000 crore out of the total FII inflows of Rs 43,500 crore witnessed in financial year 2003-04.

On Thursday and Friday net FII sales were Rs 1100 crore and over the last one week it was Rs 2570 crore. A large part of these sales are from hedge funds.

Statements made by Left leaders on scrapping of disinvestment department, increasing subsidies and lowering kerosene prices when globally crude oil prices are touching new highs were the last straw. JM Mutual Fund''s CEO, Krishnamurthy Vijayan, said that most of these hedge funds have certain stop losses and once they get triggered they just sell out completely. ""So far, the selling is largely from hedge funds, but if further declines happen over the next few days then some of the aggressive FII funds may also start selling,"" he added.

While some are attributing the Monday''s crash to a politically motivated plot, market players are denying the presence of any bear cartel. ICICI Securities head of research, Devesh Kumar, said that unnecessary statements from coalition partners on economic policy confused the investor community. ""FIIs are cautious and waiting for the formation of a new government. Their selling so far is still a very small fraction of their purchases last year,"" he said.

But, most market players found Monday''s intra-day 17per cent crash on the NSE and 15per cent drop on the BSE as excessive and unwarranted. Tata Mutual Fund''s CEO, Ved Prakash Chaturvedi, said that some of the FIIs are witnessing redemption pressures in their domestic markets and this redemption pressure is getting reflected in their selling especially in emerging markets. ""However, in India''s case this pressure got overlapped with the domestic policy transition"", he explained.

No one is willing to hazard a guess on which way the markets are headed and whether the time is right for buying now. I-Sec''s Devesh Kumar said that in the short term, till the formation of the new government, the market will continue to be volatile. ""However, once the new ministers take charge of their portfolios, the market will decide based on their image,"" he added.

Chaturvedi feels that while the short-term is risky, the medium term outlook is positive on fundamentals of the Indian economy which is growing at 5.5per cent plus. Vijayan felt that while India''s fundamentals are still strong it is the upcoming budget which will give an indication of which way the reforms process is headed.

11,Pak fishermen feared dead in Jakhau clash,"AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: There was high drama on the sea early on Tuesday morning near Jakhau on the Saurashtra coast, when Pakistani fishermen reportedly exchanged fire with Indian Navy personnel patrolling the sea after their boat strayed into Indian waters.

12,Ficci draws 10-point agenda for govt,"NEW DELHI: Apex industry chamber Ficci is not worried over the recent statements made by the Left parties advocating radical changes in the economic policy and has recommended a 10-point agenda for the new government.

The radical changes in economic policy, most importantly an increase in tax rates, suggested by some leaders of the left parties would not be carried out as no government will take an anti-growth step, Ficci President Y K Modi told newsmen here.

""Former Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, who will play an important role in the Congress-led government, has already said the new government will adopt a policy that is growth and development-oriented,"" Modi said.

""Communists have won just 60 seats. People have not voted for Left''s economic agenda,"" he said.

The chamber will, in fact, lobby for further reduction of corporate tax when it meets the Finance Minister for pre-budget consultations, he added.

The ten-point plan for the first 100 days that Ficci has chalked out, stresses on massive investments in agriculture, social and physical infrastructure.

13,MCD not to levy fees on farmhouses,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed MCD not to levy fees on farmhouses organising marriage functions or parties within the premises.

The direction is an interim one, till the next date of hearing on May 27. The temporary relief came on a petition filed by an association comprising farmhouse owners challenging the MCD''s decision to charge money from them.

While restraining the MCD from initiating ""coercive action"" against the farmhouse owners, Justice Vikramjit Sen issued notice to the MCD. Petitioner Green Garden Association claimed MCD''s policy was illegal and unfair.

The MCD''s new policy, implemented on April 1, was formulated with the idea to reduce the misuse of farmhouses which were holding marriage functions on a large scale.

According to the new rules, a farmhouse of more than three acres has to submit Rs 40,000 to the MCD for organising a marriage function. A farmhouse with less than three acres of area will have to deposit Rs 20,000 as fees.

The farmhouse owners claimed they were paying all the charges which are due to the state. Arguing on their behalf, Ravinder Sethi said whatever money his clients were deposting with the MCD also included the property tax.
