1,Students stage dharna against development fees,"HYDERABAD: A group of MCA students and their parents on Thursday staged a dharna at the Sultan-ul-Uloom College in Banjara Hills protesting the management''s refusal to allow the students to sit for the endyear internal exams if they did not pay Rs 9,000 as development fee.

The Osmania University (OU), with which the minority institutions are affiliated, says collection of development fees from MBA and MCA students is illegal. The managements contend that the university has no jurisdiction over collection of development fees and that the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has permitted them to collect the development fees.

Students furnished a letter from the registrar of OU in which college managements were asked not to insist on development fees. The management, however, refused to take cognizance of the letter.

Sultan-ul-Uloom Educational Society vice-chairperson Zafar Javed alleged that OU had no locus standi in the issue. Since the development fees was decided by AICTE, the college was collecting it from the current batches, he said and added that ""our college is not collecting development fees from students of fresh batch following Supreme Court orders.""

Javed said those who missed the internal exams would be given a chance to appear again â€” but after paying the development fees.

2,Mulayam blasts BJP for burdening nation with polls,"MUMBAI: One more â€˜Outsiderâ€™ from north India breezed into â€˜aamchiâ€™ Mumbai, and Shiv Sena, for a change, wasnâ€™t complaining.

Eager for an instant makeover of his home state, Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav met industrialists and local businessmen during his twoday visit to the metropolis. On Wednesday, Mr Yadav called on noted industrialist Anil Ambani at his residence.

Later, the UP chief minister addressed entrepreneurs, at a five-star hotel in south Mumbai, in â€˜shuddhaâ€™ Hindi and in a tone which was unmistakably- -and surprisingly â€”â€™mulayamâ€™.

However, speaking at a party meeting on Shivaji Park grounds, Mr Yadav came down heavily on the BJP for burdening the country with mid-term polls. â€œThe BJPâ€™s gameplan is to seize power on its own strength. Should the BJP succeed in doing this it would show its true colours,â€™â€™ Mr Yadav said.

Back to the chandeliered five-star hotel. Choosing development as his theme, Mr Yadav said, â€œWe can surmount all our problems and can foster communal harmony if we tackle economic issues and accord top priority to progress.â€™â€™

â€œToday, everyone is talking about how India is coming into its own and how the nation is all set to become a global superpower. But, this can happen only if UP attains development.

""Once, UP was in the forefront of the freedom movement. Itâ€™s time we restore UPâ€™s glory and this can be done only by bringing in more investment, by building roads, housing colonies, by creating jobs and by generating electricity,â€™â€™ he said.

Mr Yadav thanked Reliance Industries Limited for choosing UP for its Rs 10,000-crore gas-based power plant.

The Sahara India group too is ready with a plan for setting up houses and a super-speciality hospital in UP, he said and thanked his party colleague Amar Singh for facilitating the two mega projects.

Mr Yadav took potshots at Shiv Senaâ€™s â€˜Sons-of-the-Soilâ€™ theory, but refrained from naming the party or its leaders.

â€œWe will be creating greater social divide by threatening to ban â€˜Outsidersâ€™ from entering the city. Such a stir runs contrary to the fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution,â€™â€™ he said.

The SP leader didnâ€™t conceal his partyâ€™s ambition to seize power at the Centre. â€œYes, we want power, but not by pursuing anti-people policies.â€™â€™ Whatever that means.

He mildly chided a party functionary for describing him as the â€œnext Prime Minister of Indiaâ€™â€™. â€œPlease donâ€™t use such epithets. I will get more enemies,â€™â€™Mr Yadav remarked.

3,Rape laws loaded against men: Lawyers,"MUMBAI: The recent incident where a South African woman cried rape against a fellow national only to retract her charge later has exposed the grey areas in Indiaâ€™s rape laws, say lawyers and police officers.

The accused, a reputed high court judge, had to cool his heels in prison for three days and had his reputation shot to pieces, until the allegations were withdrawn. Last year,Mumbai bank executive Porus Mistry was slapped with charges when his colleague alleged rape on the grounds that he had had a threeyear sexual relationship with her by making false promises.

Members of the legal community and sections of the police feel that the prevailing rape laws are â€œlopsided and loaded against menâ€™â€™ and need to be modified. Former union law minister Ram Jethmalani, commenting on the rape laws, once said in a courtroom, â€œBefore I could go to bed with a woman, I would have to call a notary public.â€™â€™

The Indian Penal Code defines rape as intercourse without consent or against will. The most obvious drawback in the law is that it does not differentiate between rape and technical rape, said senior police officer Y. P. Singh.

â€œExcept for a few violent rape cases where brutal force is used most other cases involve some degree of consensual sex,â€™â€™ said Mr Singh.

According to him, rape charges have be known to be made by women who have been jilted and by minor girls who have had a consensual relationship with older men.Commercial sex workers have also pressed rape charges against clients after being shortchanged. There have also been cases of women crying â€œrapeâ€™â€™ when theyâ€™re caught in the act.

â€œIn several instances, women have exploited the law by claiming that they were not willing for intercourse but consented only out of fear,â€™â€™ said counsel P. R. Vakil.

Added criminal lawyer Shrikant Bhatt, â€œUnder the existing rape laws, if the woman states before the court that she did not consent to intercourse then the court presumes that she did not consent.â€™â€™

The law puts the burden of proof on the accused,who has to show evidence that the intercourse was with the womanâ€™s consent. This, says Mr Bhatt, is utterly absurd and impractical. â€œMore so, because the accused has to sometimes prove this several years after the incident,â€™â€™ he said.

Mr Bhatt, however, also blamed the police for acting hastily on rape complaints and damaging the reputation of innocent men beyond repair.

He said that the police often arrest the accused without an inquiry even when the law specifically states that the accusedâ€™s custody should be sought only if â€œthere are grounds to believe that the accusation or information is well-foundedâ€™â€™.

Police officers, on their part, claimed that they are always under intense pressure to show results on rape complaints. â€œThe police would have been lynched by women rights activists and the media had they not acted promptly in the recent rape case,â€™â€™ observed former police commissioner A.S. Samra. â€œMen have to bear the brunt of this haste.â€™â€™

Women rights activists and lawyers, however, counter these claims. â€œMost rape cases reported are genuine,â€™â€™ said activist Sheela Barse,qualifying that the recent case involving the South African woman was an isolated one which should not be interpreted as a new trend.

â€œIt is not true that rape laws are loaded against men,â€™â€™ said activist-lawyer Mihir Desai. â€œIn fact, the government should further refine the rape laws by including marital rape which, at present, is not considered a crime in the eyes of the law.â€™â€™

In the US, date rape or acquaintance rape is treated as rape. The same legal remedies and consequences apply to the victims and perpetrators of these rapes as apply to stranger rapes.

Former union law minister Ram Jethmalani, commenting on the rape laws, once said in a courtroom, â€œBefore I could go to bed with a woman, I would have to call a notary publicâ€™â€™

6,Bird flu scare: Hawk eye on poultry farms and airport,"KOLKATA: The bird flu scare has gripped the state. The government has beefed up watch over poultry farms and the airport has been ordered not to let any plane land if it has poultry in its cargo.

Animal husbandry minister Anisur Rahman said that the administration wouldnâ€™t take any chances although it is yet to receive reports on the avian influenza spreading in South Asia. An alert from the Union agriculture department has only intensified the stateâ€™s concerns on bird flu.

The government has set up a monitoring committee comprising chief secretary Asok Gupta, health secretary Asim Burman and animal husbandry secretary Subesh Das. Union health secretary J.V. S. Prasad Rao is coming to Kolkata to take stock of the precautionary measures.

The animal resources development department has intensified vigil in all staterun and private poultry farms as suggested in the 10-point charter issued by the Union government as a precaution against bird flu.

Rahman on Wednesday met with health minister Surjya Kanta Misra and Satyasaran Ghosh, vice-chancellor of the West Bengal University of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, to finalise the doâ€™s and dontâ€™s for poultry farms and consumers and find ways to prevent the disease.

""As of now there is no harm in taking chicken. have talked to the Bangladesh deputy high commissioner.

We have asked our officials to check with poultry farms whether their chickens had suffered from diseases similar to the H5N1 type of virus in the last month or two. If it is so, the government will impose restrictions on them,"" said Rahman.

Following the Centreâ€™s orders, poultry owners have been asked not to allow vehicles or people from outside to enter the farms.The guideline calls for keeping a tab on the suppliers of chicken feed as well. Poultry farms have been asked not to procure imported chicken feed but bank on registered domestic suppliers.

At the NSCBI Airport, the animal quarantine division has imposed a ban against import of poultry or poultry products from ""suspect"" countries.

Airport officials said the Union agriculture ministry had issued a circular that banned all aircraft carrying poultry products from landing at the airport.

""We are particularly keeping a check on planes that arrive from Thailand. Since there are no direct flights to Kolkata from Vietnam, Japan and Korea, the threat is not too great,"" airport quarantine eastern region director N.N. Ray said.

8,Phased LS polls from mid-April,"NEW DELHI: The general elections are now likely to be staggered between mid-April and the first week of May though the government would have preferred it earlier, highly-placed BJP sources said on Thursday.

This is to ensure that school examinations, which end mid-April, are not disturbed as well as give the Election Commission three weeks'' time after the last electoral rolls â€” in this case, UP â€” are revised by March 23.

The EC has informed the government that till the school examinations are over, neither government school buildings, which house a majority of polling booths, nor government school teachers, who serve as polling officers, would be free.

Besides, the necessity of revising all the electoral rolls before beginning the electoral process would have been improper.

The Lok Sabha elections will be accompanied by assembly polls in several states.

9,Telgi's 'income' in 7 yrs: Rs 3.18 cr,"BANGALORE: For a man, considered the kingpin of the estimated Rs 33,000 crore stamp paper racket in the country, Abdul Karim Telgi has officially shown an income of only Rs 3.18 crore between 1996 and 2003.

10,Muralidharan likely to quit party presidentship,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Preparing to get inducted into the Antony cabinet, the Kerala PCC-I president K Muralidharan on Friday, is understood to have conveyed to the high command his decision to quit the party post.

Muralidharan had met the Chief Minister A K Antony on Thursday and both had embraced saying that their differences were those of a family. Muralidharan, son of Antony-detractor K Karunakaran, have been keeping away from his fatherâ€™s dissidence activities in a sudden turn of events.

While Karunakaran announced his intention to float a new party soon, Muralidharan kept off and vowed to obey the high command.

When contacted, Muralidharan told the Times of India over the phone that he had informed the party leadership his willingness to give up the party post in lieu of a cabinet post. Asked if he was happy in joining the ministry he criticised till Thursday, he said it was not his happiness but that of the party that matters.

As Delhi is learnt to have given the go-ahead to Antony to take Muralidharan in the cabinet, Muralidharanâ€™s quitting the post was a foregone conclusion. However vociferous arguments are going on in the Congress camp whether the differences in Karunakaran camp over splitting the party was spontaneous or a set up conceived by the father-son duo to keep the Antony camp off the track.

11,Shahpur violence leaves eight injured,"AHMEDABAD: Tension gripped the communally sensitive Shahpur area of the walled city in Ahmedabad on Friday afternoon when violence erupted in the locality.

Police fired five rounds in the air, lobbed tear gas shells and lathi charged a mob in the Shahpur Adda area in what is seen as an ominous build-up to the Bakri-Id festival on Monday.

The incident took place around 2 pm soon after â€˜namazâ€™ in this congested locality. Spark off to the incident was provided when the Shahpur police seized a three-wheeler carrying five calves near Lal Masjid. Eight persons including four police officials were injured in the violence.

Police inspector of Shahpur police station, P P Kanani said, â€œWe had seized the loading-rickshaw that was carrying calves meant for illegal slaughter. The incident of violence took place when a foot-patrolling party was trying to clear out the crowd that had gathered after the seizure had been made.â€�

Local residents however say that soon as namaz got over people hit the streets and the cops tried to shoo them away. â€œWe have done nothing to spark off the violence yet the police harbours a partisan attitude,â€� said Gulam Ahmad.

Heavy stone pelting erupted as the police team led by Kanani suddenly found itself surrounded by a large crowd of angry residents. Some policemen were also reportedly roughed up by the angry mob. Additional forces were rushed into the area and senior police officials also reached the spot.

ACP (C Division) I C Raj was injured in the violence. A crude explosive was lobbed at him when he was headed towards the vehicle of joint CP (Sector I) P C Thakur. Shocked by the loud bang Raj fell on the road while stones rained on the vehicle which Thakur was riding in.

Around 20 tear gas shells were lobbed by the police to drive the riotous mob back indoors. A loading-rickshaw driver who was passing the â€œeffected zoneâ€� was caught and beaten up.

After about 45 minutes of â€˜free for allâ€™ the situation finally was brought under control by the police and then community leaders were called in to help maintain peace.

Police said three persons had been detained in connection with the violence. Thakur told TNN: â€œThe situation is now under control and we have stepped up patrolling in the area. Our focus now is to identify the trouble makers.â€�

Raju Maumin, municipal councillor of the Shahpur area, said: â€œWe have got life back to normal at the earliest. Soon as the violence abated we got shops reopened and the thoroughfare ready for vehicles to ply. We will hold peace talks with the police to ensure that such incidents donâ€™t recur.â€�

12,Bangla bandh on Feb 3,"KOLKATA: ""Common people"" will resist if CPM cadres try to break the Trinamul Congress, sponsored 12-hour Bangla bandh on February 3, Trinamul chairperson Mamata Banerjee warned in Kolkata on Friday.

Trinamul Congress block level leader Kripasindhu Panja along with the Jammait-ur-Rayeen filed a public interest litigation before the Calcutta High Court during the day, stating that the bandh was illegal as per an apex court decision.

The high court admitted the PIL and directed to issue notice to the respondent Triamul which was not represented in the court during hearing. The court, however, turned down a plea of the petitioners to stay the staging of the bandh.

Mamata said the Trinamul had given notice for the bandh a month ago, giving ample time to the West Bengal government to withdraw a notice on imposition of a wide range of taxes at the panchayat level. But, it had not been withdrawn.

She said the chief minister had no right to say punitive action would be taken against state government employees who would not attend office on February 3, when the employees did not have to attend office during bandhs sponsored by the ruling CPM.

She said the Trinamul wanted the bandh to be peaceful and warned against violence planned to disturb communal harmony. Qurbani on the occasion of Bakri Id in houses would, however, be allowed on the day of the bandh. Though the Id was February 2, qurbani would continue for three days.

State BJP general secretary Rahul Sinha said though the BJP was against bandhs, it would support the February 3 bandh actively, as the issue of taxes in villages was a serious one, affecting millions of people.

13,Oppn walks out to protest Kerala speaker's attitude,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: For the second day on Frdiay, the opposition LDF members walked out of the Kerala Assembly protesting against the alleged ''negative'' attitude of the speaker towards them, this time over the issue of sanctioning of B Ed colleges by education minister Nalakath Sooppy.

The trouble started when speaker Vakkom Purushothaman, against whom a notice for removal had already been served by the opposition, refused permission for a point of order raised by CPI Legislature Party Leader K P Rajendran on the B Ed college issue.

He said the speaker had refused permission for three points of orders by Jayarajan himself, Thomas Issac and Rajendran on Friday. He alledged that the speaker was defending the education minister whenever the issue came up.

Though the opposition walked out, CPI-M member A K Balan choose to stay in the house to present a private member''s bill titled the `Kerala lottery sub-agents and allied workers welfare fund bill.'' CPI member Mangode Radhakrishnan was the only other person in the opposition to second its presentation.
