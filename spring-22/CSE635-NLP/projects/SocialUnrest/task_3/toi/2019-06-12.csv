0,Rains come late for Mysore farmers,"MYSORE: Though the district has received heavy rains in the last couple of days, the farming community is not impressed.

Reason: The inadequate pre-monsoon rainfall has delayed sowing operations. This has not only worried farmers but also the agriculture department officials.

""April and May is the pre-monsoon season but we did not receive expected rainfall. This has not only hampered the sowing operations but also the department programmes,"" KR Krishnaiah, joint director, department of agriculture, has said.

The joint director said the district - on an average - receives 250 mm rainfall during pre-monsoon period. So far, it has received 129.2 mm.

In the previous year, the district had received 220 mm. This year, however, it is struggling to cross the 150 mark.

In April, he said though the expected rainfall was 64.9 mm, it recorded 150.9 mm last year, creating a record of sorts. This year, it was 29.9 mm, perhaps the lowest of all times.

In May, the district received 64.3 mm bettering corresponding year''s average of 60.6 mm. However, it is nowhere near the normal rainfall of 138.7 mm.

Nevertheless, he said H.D. Kote, Periyapatna and Mysore taluks have received normal rainfall and sowing was in full swing in these places.

Under the various department programmes, it has been planned to cover 3.74 hectares of land this time, comprising 1.95 lakh hectares of cereal crops, 53,500 hectares of pulses and 23,500 hectares of oil seeds, said the joint director. Commercial crops will be sown in 1.02 lakh hectares.

However, till June 6, only 1.13 lakh hectares were covered, of which cereals were sown in 21,493 hectares, pulses in 20,224 hectares, oil seeds in 9,236 hectares and commercial crops in 62,851 hectares.

About 24,000 quintals of seeds and 18,000 tonnes of chemical fertilisers were lying unsold in various farmers'' contact centres, he pointed out.

Krishnaiah said the department would take up distribution of seeds for crops like ragi, groundnut, paddy, etc. at subsidised prices.

""If rains fail to maintain the present tempo for next few days, it will not only affect sowing operations but also the seeds that have been sown. Yet, we hope for the best,"" he added.

1,LU student arrested for auto-lifting,"LUCKNOW: A BA II-yr student of Lucknow University (LU) was arrested along with his associate by the Madiaon police on Tuesday.

2,LU declares incomplete results,"LUCKNOW: In a tearing hurry to declare results at the earliest to meet the deadline of June 15, are the Lucknow University authorities coming out with incomplete ones?

The matter came to light on Tuesday when scores of students of BCom I thronged the registrar office with complaints that they couldnâ€™t get their results along with others.

The BCom I results of LU and associated colleges had been declared on June 4. When these results reached the colleges, many student were surprised that their roll numbers were not on the list.

When they inquired whether the results had been withheld because of some dues, they couldnâ€™t get a satisfactory answer. Colleges authorities told them that results had not come from the university and so the students rushed to the LU registrar office. However, there too no one could tell them the exact reason.

Rajesh Agarwal, a Shia college student, said that he was informed at the LU registrar office that his result had been withheld because he was absent in couple of papers. It was shocking for him as Rajesh had taken all the papers as per schedule.

There are several other similar cases from Vidyant College, Lucknow Christian College, Mahila College and also from LU.

4,Police accused of 'selecting' criminals in arrests,"LUCKNOW: The ''pick and choose'' of the state police, or call it chief minister Mayawati, in arrest of criminals and criminal-turned-politicians has not only put a question mark on the government''s motive.

The arrest of Apna Dal MLA from Allahabad (West), Atiq Ahmad, on June 6 and that of Lok Janshakti Party MLA from Rari, Dhananjay Singh, on June 10 has undoubtedly created a flutter.

For the police cadre, it has come a boost, from the powers that be, at the right time and the right way.

However, sources familiar with the underworld feel that the drive is aimed more at hitting the potent trouble-makers than merely arresting criminals.

Little wonder, then, one finds it difficult to explain how Jhunjhunwala kidnapping case accused Brij Bhushan Saran Singh and a murder accused Lalla Bhaiyya are roaming free. While Singh is beyond the police reach, Lalla Bhaiyyaâ€™s stay order on his arrest remains to be challenged before the court by the Lucknow police.

However, police officials insist that the â€˜startâ€™ was encouraging. â€œThis has sent a message down the line that none would be spared no matter who he is,â€� said a senior police officer.

â€œThe arrest of two politicians on criminal charges is no small step. Name any previous government in the past which could make such a move,â€� questioned another.

For the underworld the two arrests have sounded the warning bells for the rest in the field.

â€œIt seems independent MLA Mukhtar Ansari and criminal-turned-student leader Abhay Singh are next in the line,â€� opined a source close to the crime world.

While Mukhtar was sacked from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for anti-party activities before the assembly elections, Abhay too was shunted out on similar charges after he lost on a BSP ticket from Faizabad.

However, another segment in the underworld feels that action against Atiq and Dhananjay has come more out of a determined move. While Atiq, it is seen, has paid the price for his wild comments on Mayawati in the recent past, Dhananjay was seen as inclined towards a political rival of Mayawati.

â€œBrij Bhushan and Lalla Bhaiyya are not posing any immediate threat to the government or the administration, hence there seems hardly any chance of their arrest,â€� admitted a source in the underworld.

On Mukhtar and Abhay, the underworld feels they are the next targets. However, while Mukhtar is elusive and was yet to appear in the Vidhan Sabha since Mayawati took over the government, Abhay too has mantained a low porfile on the crime front. So, who is next? Remains a million dollar question for the underworld, politicians and the police.

5,Head of Sagar Suri Estates arrested,"NEW DELHI: Ganga Sagar Suri (81), head of Delhi Auto General Finance and Sagar Suri Estates, was arrested by the Delhi Police on Tuesday after he failed to respond to warrants issued by a city consumer court. He was released on bail after he filed a personal assurance.

The police said Suri had started several investment schemes in the mid 1990s. ""Many people had invested in bonds and fixed deposits with Suriâ€™s companies. These had matured over the past few years. Investors moved the consumer court under the Consumer Protection Act alleging that Suri had failed to pay the maturity amount and interest,"" a police officer said.

Suri, however, failed to appear in court despite having been served notices. The consumer court finally issued non-bailable and bailable warrants against Suri. He was arrested from his Tilak Road residence at about 2 pm and produced in the consumer court on Kasturba Gandhi Marg.

Suriâ€™s counsel, Sanjay Chadha, who claimed that the arrest was due to a communication gap, said his client was released on bail after filing a personal undertaking. Suri reportedly assured the court that he would not only attend all future hearings but also refund the investors within a month.

6,What’s the govt doing in liquor?,"NEW DELHI:""Donâ€™t spit. Donâ€™t fight"", say some of the posters on the wall of a reeking liquor vend run by the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation at Gole Market. And the floor has been sprinkled liberally with a disinfectant to suppress the stench from a nearby toilet.

For some, buying liquor in the city is one of the most unpleasant experiences and they feel the government should not be selling liquor at all. In fact they would prefer privatisation of liquor distribution.

""Thatâ€™s the only solution to the hiccups one experiences while buying liquor from government-run vends,"" says Amit Wangnoo, a resident of Kondli in east Delhi.

""Thereâ€™s so much rush here in the evenings that fisticuffs and stealing of bottles are very common,"" explained the man at the cash counter. Standing in queue was a harried Amit Sharma, a Northern Railway employee, who said: ""This is one of the better shops because we can at least enter it, have a look at the brands and then take our pick. Otherwise a customer canâ€™t even enter most of the vends and has to buy whatever is offered to him by the salesman.""

To prove his point, Sharma points across the street were two liquor vends are located. They offer no access. And an angry Mohit Khanna is arguing with an employee at one of the shops. ""I am looking for a popular brand which both these shops have not been storing for a long time now. Had it been a privately-run shop, all brands would have been available,"" says Khanna, who works as an assistant in a nearby toy shop.

Most of the 249 government-run shops selling Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and 30 vends selling country liquor are in a pathetic state. ""For a city having a population of over 14 million, its share of liquor vends is very less. Compare this with Bangalore which has just over five million people and 520 country liquor vends and 856 IMFL shops,"" says Delhi excise commissioner Narendra Kumar. Similarly, while Bangalore has 1,353 restaurants that serve liquor, Delhi has just 127.

J M Bhardwaj, general manager (marketing and sales) of Mount Shivalik Breweries that markets beers like Strohâ€™s, Thunderbolt and Golden Peacock, says: ""The government should allow opening of private shops so that people can get brands of their choice easily and in a better ambience. The number of outlets should also be increased to 350 at least.""

Moreover, the distribution of the vends is very lopsided. Of the nine districts here, three of them â€” south-west, central and New Delhi, have no vends. While north-west and west districts have two vends each. ""In all, about 53 assembly constituencies do not have a single liquor vend. These areas comprise more than half of Delhi. Consumers there are really inconvenienced and there is a great rush at the limited number of shops,"" said Kumar.

7,Hurriyat bandh paralyses life in Valley,"SRINAGAR: Life came to a grinding halt in Kashmir Valley on Tuesday as the All-Party Hurriyat Conferenceâ€™s bandh call in protest against Syed Ali Shah Geelaniâ€™s arrest evoked a near total response.

Endorsed by several militant outfits and the United Jehad Council, an amalgam of 14 militant outfits based in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the bandh resulted in the closure of all educational institutions, including private schools, for the day.

Shops and business establishments, too, remained shut, while thin attendance was reported in all government offices, including the civil secretariat.

Work in courts was also affected due to the non-availability of private as well as government transport. The inter-district bus service was also thrown out of gear.

The strike was total in Baramulla, Sopore, Handwara, Anantnag, Kulgam and Pulwama, while life was normal in Kupwara town in north Kashmir. Reports from Kupwara said that the police forced people to open their shops in the town.

Jamiat-e-Islami leaders have condemned the arrest of Syed Ali Shah Geelani and his two sons-in-law. It urged the state authorities to bring back Geelani from Ranchi Central jail to enable him to defend himself in the court.

""Shifting the ailing senior Jamiat leader to a far-away jail during this hot climate is vindictive and amounts to playing with his life in view of his failing health,"" said a Jamait spokesman.

Former Union home minister Mufti Mohammad Syed, in a statement, criticised Geelaniâ€™s arrest, saying it was done at a time when the international community was making efforts to ease tension between India and Pakistan.

Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen, a militant outfit, had, in a faxed statement from Muzaffarabad, said on Monday that it would intensify attacks on security forces. Security has been tightened around vital installations.

""There has been no report of any protests from anywhere in the state since Geelaniâ€™s arrest, which is indicative of the waning public support for the separatists,"" IGP K Rajendra Kumar said.

8,SIES fees against univ laws,"MUMBAI: The stage is set for a confrontation at the SIES College of Arts, Science and Commerce at Sion.

Openly defying the Mumbai university, which governs admissions to degree courses, the college is charging Rs 800 from first year degree students as contributions towards a development fund.

There are no provisions for such a fund under university rules and colleges are not supposed to collect charges other than tuition feesâ€”except under heads sanctioned by the university.

While many colleges have been collecting money surreptitiously for years now, SIESâ€™ seems to be the first instance of open defiance.

Thereâ€™s more cause for alarm for university officials. SIESâ€™ reason for charging extra fees and for the necessity of a development fund because the state government has not released a non-salary grant for two years, has found favour among many college principals.

""We need non-salary grant to pay electricity bills and other maintenance charges,"" said V. Shankar, SIES trustee. ""But the government owes us over Rs 65 lakh now. How much longer can the management go on paying all the bills?"" Mr Shankar added that he had weighed the odds before deciding to charge the development fund. ""We will give our reasons in court if need be.""

Moreover, educational institutions could be run only on a no-profit, no-loss principle, Mr Shankar said. ""We canâ€™t function on a regular loss-making basis.""

SIES is also charging Rs 115 as examination fees from students. These funds, a college official said, will be used for meeting the expenditure incurred on conducting college exams and assessing papers, among other things.

St. Xavierâ€™s at Fort, on the other hand, had mooted the idea of charging a development fund sometime ago. ""I wrote to the joint director of higher education, saying that we should be allowed to charge Rs 1,000 for a development fund,"" said Fr Joe Dias, college principal. The college, however, did not go ahead with the proposal as went against university rules, he claimed.

Charging extra fees was becoming necessary as the college was running a deficit in the absence of non-salary grant, Fr Dias said. ""We are supposed to get Rs 28 lakh every year and instead, managements end up paying the bills every time."" Many colleges will turn to corrupt practices only to survive, he added.

In fact, there are already complaints from students about several colleges charging fees over and above what has been prescribed. Many authorities charge extra money for admission forms, while others quietly ask for donations. At a Bandra college, for instance, a student said that authorities charged Rs 200 as contributions to development fund.

Some of these complaints have been put up before the universityâ€™s observation committee, whose members are supposed to monitor the admission procedure in colleges. It is learnt that SIESâ€™ case has also come up before the panel. University statutory body members said that the college could not use the no-grant reason for charging extra fees. ""Rules have to be followed, whatever be the reasons,"" an observer committee member said. The college has charged Rs 915 more from almost 1,600 students, which totals up to a fund of over Rs 14 lakh, the member added.

Meanwhile, another observation committee member Deepak Kumar Mukadam, said that several colleges were not displaying list of students securing admissions properly. ""Colleges are supposed to display a list of students against the number of seats available, on the basis of merit. But many are not doing that,"" he said.

The observation committee will submit a report on the irregularities seen in colleges to the university.

9,Sex test law kills off ultrasound,"NEW DELHI: As the government, under pressure from the Supreme Court, cracks the whip to implement a law banning sex selection, medical professionals are trying to devise mechanisms for continuing with the legitimate use of ultrasound.

Ultrasound is used for determining the sex of the foetus, but it is an important diagnostic tool as well.

The aim of the law, framed in 1994, was to penalise those who assist in the process of female foeticide by determining, medically, the sex of the foetus. However, eagerness to implement the law has resulted in checking the use of ultrasound even by those clinics which do not offer any maternity services.

Recent interpretations of the law have made routine ultrasound scans for a pregnancy almost impossible. Doctors are having to give reasons such as ""history of aspirin"" for an ultrasound scan of a pregnant woman. And patients requiring diagnostic services for a heart, kidney or another condition requiring an ultrasound, find doctors unwilling to provide the services.

""Until we get a clarification, even cardiologists are prohibited from taking their portable ultrasound machines out. All free heart check-up camps too have been stopped for the same reason,"" says the head of a branch of the Indian Medical Association, K K Aggarwal.

Chairperson of the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act advisory committee of the Delhi government, Dr Sharda Jain, says that not only are doctors being harassed but foeticide continues just the way it did earlier.

""If a woman comes to me in her third month of pregnancy and I refuse to abort, then she must be finding a place to get it done, if she does not come back to me again,"" says Jain. ""We have been telling the government of places where people are sitting with these ultrasound machines and termination of pregnancy too is taking place, but nothing happens.""

Undoubtedly, the issues are complex and the problem of foeticide needs to be addressed at several levels.

Member of the national monitoring board for the PNDT Act, Mira Shiva, agrees that the sensitisation of people responsible for its implementation in various states has not been adequate.

However, national convener of the IMA''s female foeticide campaign committee Vinay Aggarwal, who tried to get doctors to be sensitive to the issue, is no longer so enthusiastic. ""In the name of implementation ''inspector raj'' has taken over, which has done little else, except getting ultrasound centres sealed.""

10,Zilla polls win proof of popularity: CM,"CHANDIGARH: Exuding confidence following clean sweep by his party in zila parishad and panchayat samiti polls held on Sunday, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh claimed that the partyâ€™s successive third win was a testimony that the Congress government was living up to peopleâ€™s expectations. He was talking to reporters here on Tuesday.

He said the Congress had won in Moga, Muktsar, Faridkot and Mansa districts where the party had drawn blank in the assembly elections.

Releasing the detailed ZP&PS results, Amarinder said that the Congress had won 1,574 out of the 2,459 panchayat samiti seats results for which were available. Results for 22 samiti seats were still awaited.

The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had to content with only 55 seats and BJP with 23 seats while the CPI could manage 19 seats. The remaining 288 seats went to the independents.

The Congress victory in case of ZP polls was more impressive as it cornered about 77 per cent of the total seats. Out of the 281 zila parishad seats, results have been declared for 264. The Congress has won 208 while the SAD could manage only 42, BJP one and independents 12.

Of the 17 districts in the state, the Congress has absolute majority in 16 while in Kaputhala, both the Congress and SAD have shared five seats each. In an overwhelming number of districts, the Congress has secured between two third to three fourth majority, reducing the presence of the SAD-BJP combine to negligible.

When asked why the party failed to perform well in Kapurthala, Amarinder conceded that it was not possible for anybody to have uniform success rate everywhere.

11,Abducted Madhepura lawyer returns,"MADHEPURA: Advocate Jawed Akhtar, who was kidnapped a few days ago, has escaped from the clutches of the kidnappers. Madhepura police brought him here on Monday evening.

Akhtar was kidnapped by motorcycle-borne armed criminals from near Madhepura block office eight days ago when he was on way to Madhepura court from his neighbouring Jhitkiya village.

Madhepura police have heaved a sigh of relief with the return of the kidnapped advocate. Sources said the kidnappers took the advocate to Murli village under the Kishanpur PS of Supaul district and kept him in a ditch covered with thatch. One of the kidnappers kept a tab on him.

Akhtar escaped from the hideout when the criminal watching him fell asleep, and took shelter in another tola of the same village. On a tip-off, Kishanpur police rescued him from there. Five persons of the village were arrested in connection with the incident.

13,Bar Council polls may be postponed,"PATNA: The much-delayed elections to the Bar Council are again likely to be postponed from the scheduled date on August 5 with the the returning officer V N Sinha expressing his reservations in a letter to the Bar Council because of non-publication of the final list as yet.

The finalisation of the preliminary list by two members of the special committee, Ramchandra Jha and Keshav Shrivastava, who are also reported to be candidates in the coming elections, as final on June 4 in the absence of Advocate General Shashi Anugrah, who is the ex-officio chairman and the third member, has added a new twist to the already controversial election.

Three members of the superceded state bar council Kameshwar Pandey, Suraj Narayan Prasad Sinha and Baleshwar Sharma in a press meet, have accused that the enrolment of voters for the ensuing election has been done with malafide intention by the current team managing it.

Twenty associations in the state have no member enrolled as voter and almost another 13 have only a half of the lawyers in those association as voters. Thousand of dead members have also been enrolled as voters among other irregularities, they alleged.

Member of the special commitee managing the affairs of the bar council after its supercession Keshav Shrivastava said that it was a catch-22 situation for them. The voter and association were given ample time to file objections and any further extension in the schedule would have led to the postponement of election. Objection was also invited through newspaper advertisement, he added.

The bar council was formed under an Act of Parliament to regulate the profession and to work for the welfare of the lawyers. Elections are to be held after every five years. The term of the bar council ended in August 2000. Twice, the Bar Council of India extended it for six months.

Finally it had to supercede it as stipulated under the statute and formed a special committee to oversee elections.

The erstwile members of the bar council have often alleged that the special commitee was not interested in holding election so that they enjoy the privelege. The bar council has failed in both its primary duty of policing the profession as well looking after its interest according to young advocates like Chakrapani who accuse them of squandering millions of bar council money on perks like travelling allowance without doing anything tangible for the interests of lawyers.

They are also cut up with monopolising the allotment of chambers in the coveted bar council bhavan, because of its central location and vicinity to the Patna High Court.

15,Punching machines only for few govt offices,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: There was no immediate plan to extend punching system to all government offices in the state, Chief Minister A K Antony, said on Wednesday.

Replying to questions in the state assembly, he said any decision on the matter would be taken only after considering all aspects of the issue as installation of punching machines in a few selected offices did not yield the desired results.

The punching system was introduced in the Annexe of the state secretariat, the collectorate here, the Directorate of General Education, Civil stations at Thrissur, Kannur and Kollam by the previous LDF government on the basis of a recommendation of the administrative reforms committee. In all 72 machines costing Rs 47 lakh were purchased and seven of them had developed snags, he said.

The government gave priority in ensuring that the public received better and timely service from the government offices, he said.

Antony said he would continue his sudden inspection of government offices.

17,Modi asks partymen to be ready for early polls,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat unit of BJP held a meeting of MPs and MLAs here on Tuesday to chalk out a strategy for the Assembly election, which is due in February next but could be advanced.

Chief of state''s party unit Rajendrasinh Rana told PTI here on Wednesday that an analysis and assessment of BJP''s strength, drawbacks and other outstanding issues concerning the organisation were taken up at the meeting headed by Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

18,Somnath slams Gujarat governor's remark on polls,"KOLKATA: CPI(M) Parliamentary party leader Somnath Chatterjee has slammed Gujarat Governor Sunder Singh Bhandari''s statement that the situation in the riot-hit state was conducive for holding Assembly polls.

""The governor is an RSS man and he has displayed his true colours. His statement is an unauthorised, unconstitutional and improper exercise of power. This is only a ploy of the Centre''s ruling NDA to proclaim to the outside world that normalcy had returned to the state. But ground realities do not hold this view,"" Chatterjee told a press conference here on Wednesday.

The veteran leader, after his visit to Gujarat as leader of a delegation of Left parties, expressed concern that the state government was yet to take steps to alleviate the sufferings of the affected people, including minorities.

""Even FIRs are not being accepted. Lawyers in the state are afraid to fight cases for the victims. But now a handful of lawyers from other states have gone there to help the affected,"" he said.

19,Limited choices for govt on Tanir Bavi,"MANGALORE: Does the Karnataka government have any other choice than allowing the Tanir Bavi Barge-Mounted Power Project (BMPP) continue its operations beyond seven years?

At present, the choices before the power-starved state government are limited. Of the 26 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed between the state government and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) a few years ago, only one -- Tanir Bavi -- has materialised and others have turned their backs on the state. Because the state dilly-dallied on escrow cover and assured returns.

Adding to this was the government''s inability to address the environmental concerns in this eco-sensitive region, which made IPPs hesitant to set their foot. This include the 1000-MW Cogentrix thermal power plant (later taken over by the China Light Power Company) and Nagarjuna.

Moreover, when Tanir Bavi project was in the nascent stage, three other companies had bid to set up BMPP in Tanir Bavi area. They also vanished without a trace after public opposition.

Power production by any other means, as compared to hydel, is not cheap. A case in point is Tanir Bavi which sells power to the KPTC at Rs 4 per unit -- which includes fixed cost of Rs 2, other fixed charge of Rs 2.04 and variable tariff (of naptha fuel).

After the dismantling of administered price mechanism (APM), naphtha prices have been hovering on the upper mark. But, P. Chakrapani, vice-president (strategic planning and business development), GMR Group (whose subsidiary is Tanir Bavi), asserts that at present they can cushion the hike in naphtha price and not pass it to the KPTC -- as they get the fuel at a special price from the petroleum company.

But this cannot go on for long as the PPA does not allow storage of more than a month''s stock of naphtha, in case of tremendous increase in international oil prices, he adds.

Regarding extending the PPA beyond even years, Chakrapani said the company has indicated its willingness to extend the stay of the plant in Mangalore beyond seven years. But it still has not got a reply from the government.

Chakrapani pointed out that the BMPP has a life of 30 years and it would be beneficial to extend the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) beyond seven years as the costs would be spread over a period, so the cost of supply of power to KPTC an be brought down considerably.

The dismal state of affairs in the power sector can be gauged from the fact that once a power surplus state has been reduced to power deficit state due to rapid industrialisation. Add to it the transmission and distribution losses of 38 per cent. So at any given point of time, the peak shortage is about 500-700 MW.

At present, Tanir Bavi has been producing 220 MW of power at 90 per cent Plant Load Factor (PLF).

It may be recalled that the Tanir Bavi project was allowed in the first place as a stop-gap arrangement till Cogentrix established its plant in this region -- as BMPPs had short gestation period as compared to thermal-based plants.

Beset with these problems, including nagging technical ones at the Raichur Thermal Power Station, the options before the government are none but to extend the PPA with Tanir Bavi.
