1,RSS to have final say in BJP candidates’selection,"lucknow: the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) is setting the agenda for the bharatiya janata party (bjp). senior sangh leaders have been camping at 5, kalidas marg, the official residence of chief minister rajnath singh, for the last two days to discuss selection of candidates for the forthcoming assembly elections. even the nitty-gritty of poll alliance with other political parties is being discussed threadbare. it is for the first time that senior rss leaders, including head of awadh prant ashokji, have agreed to hold a meeting outside the precincts of keshav bhawan - the sangh headquarters in lucknow. he was at chief minister's residence since morning, said a close aide of the cm on tuesday. the chief minister, state bjp chief kalraj mishra and organisational secretaries of the bjp appointed by the sangh, were taking part in the meeting. none of the senior ministers, including lalji tandon and om praksh singh, were invited. this meeting is a clear indication that the sangh has taken up the cudgels on behalf of bjp. the message has become clearer after sureshrao ketkar, in-charge of up affairs, asked sangh workers to forgo their personal interests for the sake of party and country. in this hour of crisis, sangh workers should help the bjp to defeat anti-hindu forces, ketkar had said last week in lucknow. the timing of this message was important as the sangh workers had become disenchanted with the bjp rule in the state. just a few months back they had voiced anger over raw treatment meted out to them by bjp ministers. even the message from nagpur was not to help the bjp in the elections. but ketkar's words had helped in clearing clouds in keshav bhawan. we are clear what we have to do now, said an rss functionary. bade hit ke liye chotte hit ko tyagna hai (we have to sacrifice smaller benefits in the interest of biggers ones), he said. after this message, the sangh leaders had meetings with rajnath singh and kalraj mishra at niralanagar and decided to finalise the list of party candidates for the coming polls. incidentally, kushabhau thakre had already held seat-wise discussions with senior state leaders almost a month back and prepared a constituency-wise panel of candidates. it would be now upto the election committee to finally decide about candidates, thakre had told times news network. the same list has been put under microscope by the sangh leader. a senior sangh functionary said that senior rss leaders, including ashokji and vijay goel, would judge candidates according to the feedback received from different sources. he added that these leaders would have a final say about the candidates selected by thakre.

4,Meet likely to question state's Marathi policy,"pune: the government's policy on marathi, the official language of the state, is likely to come in for some serious grilling at the 75th marathi literary meet, which opens in two weeks' time in the city. the decision to offer information technology as an alternative to marathi at the junior college level has sparked off a heated reaction in literary circles. some of that heat is likely to be vented at a special session titled 'the language policy of state government is insulting to marathi' scheduled to be held on the second day (january 19), said dr g.n. joglekar, president of the akhil bharatiya marathi sahitya mahamandal, the chief organising body of marathi literary meets. and the men expected to take the hot seat on behalf of the government are ulhas pawar, chairman, rest of maharashtra statutory development board and a.g. patil, director, language directorate. addressing a press conference here on wednesday, joglekar explained that after the formation of the state in 1960, chief minister yashwantrao chavan had announced several steps and policies to promote marathi. ""people in the state would like to know what happened to those policies,"" he said. on being asked why the literary body accepted rs 25 lakh from the state government earlier this week, if it was so opposed to its language policy, joglekar said that just by accepting assistance from the government, the meet was not obliged to discuss subjects agreeable to the government. ""we have our views and they will be expressed firmly,"" he added. he, however, clarified that the meet should not be taken as a battlefield. the meet will be inaugurated by history scholar babasaheb purandare at the police parade ground on january 18 at 3.30 pm. president-elect of the 75 sammelan author rajendra banhatti will take over charge from outgoing president vijaya rajadhyaksha. the inaugural session will be followed by a story-telling session in memory of the late vyankatesh madgulkar and the late 'vapu' kale who pioneered story-telling in modern times. a seminar on the contribution of public libraries, an interview session with noted author shivaji sawant, an interaction between children and writers, dramatisation of works of departed litterateurs in which stage and screen actors will participate are some of the other highlights of the sammelan.

5,CM launches Cong civic polls campaign,"pune: launching the congress party's campaign for the forthcoming civic polls, chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on tuesday sought to elicit the support of the youth, women and the minorities even as he charged the opposition parties in the state of destabilising communal harmony in maharashtra to derive political gains. addressing a party workers rally at the wanowrie grounds on the first day of the new year, deshmukh tried to woo the minorities as also women by citing the democratic and financial powers given to them by his government. we have restarted the minorities commission and given women their due through representations at various levels of the power structure, he said. and it was the congress party which gave youth the right to exercise their franchise by lowering the voting age to 18, said deshmukh. he termed his government 'propoor' for insisting that despite security concerns, pre-1995 slums would not be demolished under any circumstances. if the slums have to be removed for some developmental work, the government will ensure alternative housing, he declared. justifying his government's decision to delink 20 of the 38 fringe villages from the pune municipal corporation limits, the chief minister said the 'bold step' was taken considering the interest of the farmers who had complained that they would have lost their lands due to reservations. he criticised former chief minister manohar joshi for envisaging the proposal of merging 38 villages into the pmc when the original proposal of the civic body was for inclusion of just ten villages. although our decision may have inconvenienced people with vested interests, the final decision was based on a genuine survey report prepared by an expert commission, he said. he accused the bjp-shiv sena alliance of encouraging communal tendencies. he also struck a warning note about internal bickering within his own party. district level leaders should ensure that tickets are given only to deserving candidates who know the pulse of the common people. let sycophants surrounding ministers continue with their petty politics. the grassroot worker should not be deprived of his chance to get the candidature, he told district officebearers. he also censured industries minister patangrao kadam for being absent during the interview process for selection of congress candidates.

8,UP elections will have impact on national politics,"new delhi: the announcement of the assembly election dates for uttar pradesh has lent an urgency to the political battle whose outcome will impact national politics like nothing before in the recent past. when results are announced for most of the seats by february 25, parliament will be in session. the mandate from the electorate in the most populous state is sure to change equations in national politics. that the up verdict will have a direct bearing on the future course of national politics is clear from the intensity of the campaign being carried out by the rival camps. even before the official candidates' lists are out, senior functionaries of the contending parties have begun to criss-cross the state. only days before the announcement, up chief minister rajnath singh had come to delhi and had a long meeting with prime minister vajpayee. home minister advani and hrd minister m m joshi were also present during the discussions. despite the fiscal difficulties, the centre has been quite liberal in meeting the state's demands for additional funds. the cm has made a spate of announcements, provoking sharp comments from his rivals. the cm, the sp leader mulayam singh yadav and the bsp boss mayawati have been on the road for the past few months. while such top leaders of people's front as former prime minister v p singh and marxist veteran jyoti basu are likely to hit the sp campaign trail, the bjp and the congress have decided to deploy their top campaigners. though the congress stakes are lower in up, sonia gandhi's campaigning will be keenly watched by observers. clearly for both the bjp and the sp the stakes in up are quite high. if the bjp and its allies manage to hold on to power, that will consolidate the prime minister's position and make the coalition government at the centre more durable. however, if the people's front's grouping led by the sp is able to unseat the bjp, it will have an unsettling effect on the nda combine. in that case, some of the bjp allies may take a second look at the alignment with an eye to the future. what has made the polls results uncertain is the strong presence of mayawati's bsp and new assertion by the congress. more than any other party, the pro-dalit bsp has a solid and committed support base. besides, the bsp is sure to attract a section of the muslims.

10,Prison escapees arrested in Saket,"new delhi: two alleged criminals who had been on the run after escaping from a prison van in november last year were arrested by the police on tuesday. the two accused, subhash chander alias surya (21) and bunty (25), were reportedly armed with handguns at the time of their arrest. police officials said the duo have committed over 40 heinous crimes, including contract murders and kidnappings. the two have also allegedly fired at police officials in the past. according to the police, on november 22 last year a haryana police jail van was taking the two accused along with four undertrials from the bahadurgarh court to a jail in rohtak. subhash and bunty allegedly broke a window and jumped out of the moving van in sonepat. a few days back the special staff of the south delhi police learnt that the duo were coming to a market in saket. a trap was laid and the two arrested. police officials claimed that a .32 bore revolver and a .315 bore pistol were recovered from the duo. during questioning bunty reportedly told the police he had committed about 20 heinous crimes including dacoities, murders and robberies. police officials said bunty was a school dropout and had taken to wrestling. it was with some fellow wrestlers that bunty allegedly kidnapped a child from rohtak. he was arrested for the kidnapping, but once he released from jail he formed his own gang and took to robberies and dacoities. over the next few months the gang was responsible for a number of sensational crimes. bunty, said officials, was behind a number of robberies at petrol pumps and outside banks. the accused also reportedly told the police that had they not been arrested, they would have murdered three undertrials in faridabad. the trio had apparently been involved in the murder of a friend.

11,Bank strike to protest Stanchart staff ‘ill-treatment’,"kolkata: bank employees in west bengal would stage a strike on january 4 as part of the all india bank strike called by all india bank employees' association (aibea) against alleged atrocities on employees of standard chartered bank by its management. bank employees of the state are going to observe the strike, bengal provincial bank employees' association (bpbea) general secretary rajen nagar said on wednesday. united forum of bank unions (ufbu), the umbrella organisation of all bank unions, has extended its full support to the strike apart from all central trade unions, nagar said in a release. he said the left front chairman biman bose and leader of opposition in state assembly pankaj banerjee have also supported the strike. meanwhile, a large number of leaders of bank unions on wednesday staged a massive 'dharna' at the call of bpbea against stanchart management's 'illegal, arbitrary, malafide and motivated' penal transfers of 22 clerks and subordinate staff from kolkata to chennai and delhi for their refusal to accept vrs. this is a brazen violation of industry-level settlement in terms whereof an employee can be transferred within the same linguistic area, nagar said. the bank has engaged hundreds of casual contract labour, outsourcing virtually all routine jobs to contract labour, he said.

12,Trinamul’s moral support to Suci bandh,"kolkata: the trinamul congress has decided to lend moral support to the bangla bandh called by suci on january 10. a decision to this effect was taken during a meeting of trinamul's extended state committee which met here on wednesday. speaking to newsmen after the meeting, trinamul supremo mamata banerjee said that though suci was a small party with left leanings, the issue raised by it was of immense public interest. incidentally, suci had given the bandh call as a mark of protest against the exorbitant rise in electricity tariff. in addition to the hike in electricity tariff, we have also decided to add the issues of hike in the charges of health services and in school and college fees, banerjee said. she said that though her party had decided to extend only moral support to suci's bandh call, instead of physical support, her party cadres will stand beside suci cadres if the police or cpm cadres tried to use force. with trinamul deciding to stand by its colleagues from suci, the state is likely to come to a standstill on january 10. explaining the rationale behind extending moral support to the suci, banerjee said that the state government was taking one anti-people stand after the other. trinamul congress state committee also announced its law violation programme which will be launched on january 8 from kolkata's gandhi statue. during the month-long programme spread all over the state, party cadres will demonstrate in front of dms' offices in the districts. apart from issues of hike in school and college fees and electricity tariff, the trinamul law-violation programme will also protest against the recent state government decision to haul up those indulging in rail and road blockade. this is nothing short of stifling democratic movement, mamata banerjee pointed out. on the question of the recent state government decision to evict encroachers from different parts of the city, the trinamul congress chairperson said that such drives were being launched especially in her constituency without any alternatives being provided by a state government who are only looking after the interests of small-time traders. we are not anti-development, but the state government has dissociated itself from the concerns of common people, banerjee pointed out.

13,Syllabus delay may increase sale of NCERT books,"new delhi: the delay in the release of the revamped syllabus by the national council of educational research and training may open a new chapter for its book sales. islanded mostly in government schools, ncert books may find a taker in private schools - simply because of the prevailing confusion. school principals, who were usually flooded with private publisher books by this time, are finding the going dry. ''the whole process of selecting books and placing orders used to be completed in january. this time, we have not been approached by a single publisher,'' said springdales principal jyoti bose. added gyan bharti principal r c shekhar: ''at least, by this time, we used to get samples of all private publisher books.'' this time there are none. some principals have therefore decided to give a thumbs up to ncert books. ''we would like to opt for ncert books for lower classes, this year, to get a better hold on the syllabus,'' said crpf principal suraj prakash. the council will bring out new books for classes i, ii, iii, vi, ix and xi. the book profile in private schools which used to be dominated by private publishers for the lower classes may therefore undergo a change. said a daryaganj book distributor: ''it is only in lower classes, below class viii, that private publishers have any scope of pushing their books. but this time, even that is becoming impossible''. only the ncert's hindi and math books overran the competition earlier. the council books are mandatory class x onwards. ''a number of schools in other states such as bihar start their sessions in march. i doubt if private publishers will be able to make the deadline,'' said rohit dhar of vikas publications. even ncert officials admit that private publishers used to beat them flat in the competition because they were able to get their books munch earlier into the market. ''this year we are expecting to sell books worth more than rs 500 crore. the council sold books worth rs 42.41 crore in 2000 and rs 47 crore last year,'' said ncert publications division head puran chand. but he attributes this expectation to the improved quality in the ncert books. ''the printing and paper quality will be superior this time,' he added.

21,"CPI wants hospital rate cut, but not for bandh","kolkata: the cpi, an important partner of the left front, has written to front chairman biman bose, demanding immediate reduction in the recent hike in hospitals charges. the party has, however, opposed the suci-sponsored bangla bandh slated for january 10, which has been called to demand among other things withdrawal of the increase in hospital charges and power tariff. in a letter written to the left front chairman on wednesday, cpi state secretary manju kumar majumdar said that though it had become imperative for the government to increase the charges, the hike had become so steep that it had gone beyond the capacity of the poor and the middle classes. for patients staying in paying beds of the non-teaching government hospitals, a test for blood chloresterol has been increased from rs 40 to rs 165. the rate for tc, dc, hb and rbc has gone up from a mere rs 5 to rs 40. the charges for laparoscopy has gone up from rs 400 to rs 1,000, the cpi said in its letter to the front chairman. yet, the cpi felt that the suci should not have called the bangla bandh and instead should have opted for the path of negotiation with the government. only on wednesday, the rsp, another partner of the left front had announced its support for the demands raised by the suci. with the cpm determined to foil the proposed bandh, party insiders, however, remained skeptical. on thursday they said that the rsp and the cpi's open support to the demands of the bandh sympathizers would only help in ensuring the success of the bandh. cpi leader for militant trade unionism: all india trade union congress general secretary gurudas dasgupta on thursday called for reintroduction of militant trade-unionism against anti-working class policies of the centre. we will call pre-budget general strikes to bring to a halt the anti-people conspiracy hatched in the proposed budget, said dasgupta. but dasgupta was quick to clarify, militant trade-unionism does not mean violence, but an uncompromising approach on the part of the trade unions. dasgupta, however, strongly criticised trinamul-suci sponsored bandh describing it as a politically motivated strike by an wild combination of people to reap political benefit.

''the investigation against him by enforcement directorate started only after the tehelka expose when the income tax department failed to find anything incriminating from his residence in a raid on march 23 last year,'' argued senior advocate and the former law minister shanti bhushan, appearing on behalf of sharma. the ed was represented by the solicitor general of india, harish salve, who filed the reply to sharma's bail plea immediately and said he would start his arguments on friday. during the arguments, bhushan told justice s k agarwal his client was being hounded because his news portal, in a sting operation conducted about nine months ago, had exposed the bribery and corruption among the ruling party stalwarts. sharma, who owns first global, has a 14.5 per cent stake in tehelka.com. he was picked up by the ed officers for questioning on december 17 2001 and placed under arrest the next day. after remanding him to ed custody till january 1, the court remanded him to judicial custody in tihar jail. he moved the high court after his bail application was rejected by a magistrate. during his arguments, bhushan told the court that when ed could not fix him under foreign exchange management act, it invoked the old law, foreign exchange regulation act, and used its provisions to throw him behind bars. bhushan contended the allegation of under-invoicing of the price of 9.52 lakh himachal futuristic communications limited shares sold to about 16 foreign institutional investors through stock broker shankar sharma was incorrect. ''the price of rs 1,050 was fixed by hfcl's board of directors for the 9.52 lakh shares released for sale through private placement, not for general sale in open market,'' he said. sale of shares through the private placement by a company is entirely different from general sale and all the fiis had bought them at the same price, he said. bhushan said first global was the only non-japanese share broker company which had been registered in london stock exchange and the nasdaq. ''sharma was considered to be an honest broker by income tax authorities as he was among the top tax payers. only last year, he had paid tax worth rs three crore,'' bhushan told the court.
