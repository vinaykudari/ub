0,"Darjeeling farm culls 12,000 hens","DARJEELING: The authorities of a poultry farm in Darjeeling buried alive on Thursday 12,000 egg-laying hens, describing the move as a precautionary measure against bird flu and to safeguard public health.

Manager Sudhir Bhitrikoty of the 40-year-old poultry farm, St. Alphonsus'' Social and Agricultural Centre, said ""these fowls are not sick, but as a precautionary measure, we are taking this step to safeguard the health of our workers, children and people who buy our products.â€�

He said the poultry used to earn Rs 4 lakh a month by selling eggs of these birds.

When asked why the Centre had taken such a step, Bhitrikoty said, ""Since Pakistan and Bangladesh are facing the problem of bird flu, there is no guarantee that the flu will not enter India.

1,Open sky policy fiasco hits Chandrababu hard,"NEW DELHI: The failure of the civil aviation ministry to get the Cabinet''s nod for an open sky policy is a setback for Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

The powerful satrap, known for having his way with the Centre, had lobbied with the Centre for the policy hoping that it would improve access to Hyderabad for software shoppers.

His persuasion forced the Centre to retrieve the matter from the backburner. The TDP chief secured a commitment on the issue from the Prime Minister at the dinner party he hosted for the BJP brass when they were in Hyderabad for the national executive meeting.

Unsurprisingly, his presence in the Capital, though allegedly for the mundane matter of subsidy for minor irrigation, was to see that the matter got the clearance.

The fiasco is puzzling because NDA-TDP equations look stronger than they ever did. This is only the second time when Naidu failed to push through his agenda.

The blemishes, notwithstanding, Chandrababu boasts of an impressive scorecard; one which evoked envy and exposed the Centre to charges of partisanship. His success in leveraging the device of ""support from outside"" for favours is believed to have so impressed Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa that she wants to traverse the same route.

The fight over the policy as well as the deferment of the decision to hike the FDI cap for the telecom sector also throw light on the way PM continues to ration the exercise of his powers. The Prime Minister was keen on swift action on both issues.

He, however, preferred to see his colleagues putting the wrench in his works rather than crack the whip.

2,Mayor rules out shifting of book fair,"KOLKATA: Mayor Subrata Mukherjee may have differences with the Publishers and Booksellers Guild over the collection of amusement tax from the Kolkata Book Fair, but he agrees that it should not shift to Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

On Thursday, Mukherjee said he would take initiative to stop the shifting of the fair venue.

Mukherjee gave his reasons as well. ""The infrastructure at the fair ground on EM Bypass is not yet ready. The Kolkata Book Fair is a huge affair. It will not be possible to hold it in a similar fashion there from the next year,"" he said.

Even after the Calcutta High Court directive on shifting all fairs from the Maidan adjacent to the Victoria Memorial, the Guild was not too willing to move to the Bypass on a plot provided by KMC.

The mayor, too, argued that the book fair venue was not adjacent to the Victoria Memorial.

3,State government owes the BMC Rs 457 crore,"MUMBAI: The state government owes the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) a staggering Rs 457.74 crore as arrears, which has accumulated over the last decade.

Civic sources said that this amount could come in handy for the municipal corporation which got out of the financial red only last year. This year, the corporation has announced a modest surplus of Rs 37 lakhs.

â€œThe corporation could easily have utilised this amount for various public schemes and also for developing the cityâ€™s infrastructure,â€™â€™ observed a senior civic official.

A major chunk of the arrears is in the civic educational programmes. Since 1995 the government has not fully paid grant-in-aids for secondary education, which amounts to Rs 140.37 crore. For primary education, the arrears have piled up to Rs 82.71 crore.

In fact, the government did not pay a single paisa last year as grant-in-aid for secondary education against the BMCâ€™s expenditure bill amounting to Rs 91 crore.

As a result, the corporation has not been able to hire any teaching staff over the last several years, said a civic official.

â€œThis has directly affected the quality of education thatâ€™s imparted in the 49 civic-aided secondary schools and 1,191 primary schools,â€™â€™ the official added. The state government also owes the corporation arrears amounting to Rs 44.52 crore in property tax and Rs 50.32 crore in water tax and water charges.

In fact, in its 2004-2005 budget, the municipal corporation has noted that there has been â€œno improvement in the recoveryâ€™â€™ from the government in respect of primary and secondary education, health services, charges from censused h u t m e n t dwellers, land revenue, entertainment tax et al.

A senior civic official said that they had vigorously raised the arrears issue with the state government last year at various levels, including the state finance minister and chief secretary, but to no avail.

â€œAs a last resort, the corporation had withheld the amount it had to pay the government after collecting taxes on its behalf and hence has managed to adjust some of the dues,â€™â€™ he said.

Acting principal secretary (finance) Chitkala Zutshi said that she did not have the figures in hand and could not comment on the issue.

4,Schools frown at govt fiat,"PUNE: In an effort to promote consumer rights awareness among school children, the Union ministry of food and civil supplies has directed the setting up of 300 consumer clubs in all schools in Pune district by February 15.

While the aim is laudable, school principals have reservations about the extra load it would bring on the already crowded time-table.

The principals also felt that the time given for setting up such clubs was inadequate and that the subject should have been included in extra-curricular activities which are already part of the calendar.

Ramchandra Jadhav, education officer (secondary), told TNN on Thursday that a ministry notification calling for setting up the clubs was received five days ago.

Each school has to appoint 50 students and a teacher for the activity, for which an annual grant of Rs 10,000 will be given. â€œFor every 20 clubs, one non-governmental organisation (NGO) will be appointed as a nodal agency to monitor their functioning,â€� he explained. The nodal agency will receive Rs 2,000 from each school as charges.

â€œThe main activity of the clubs will be to celebrate world and national consumer days on March 15 and December 24, respectively, create awareness about consumer rights and welfare, print posters and arrange lectures,â€� Jadhav said.

The best three clubs in every group will be given cash awards of Rs 3,000, Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,000, respectively. The best club in the country will get an award of Rs 5,000 from the ministry.

Bindumadhav Joshi, national president of the Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat (ABGP), welcomed the move. He said the ABGP will actively participate in setting up such clubs in schools throughout the country.

â€œSatish Tripathi, chief secretary of Union ministry of food and civil supplies, will hold a meeting of ABGP zonal chiefs in Pune on Saturday to fine-tune the schemeâ€�, Joshi said. The consumer body has already prepared a separate curriculum for the clubs, he added.

Principals of schools are not really thrilled with the idea. â€œWe already have activities like NCC (National Cadet Corps), scout, RSP (Road Safety Patrol), social work, value education and environment education.

Where will be the time to add one more activity,â€� asked a principal. Another principal said although consumer education was important, it should be incorporated in extra-curricular activities.

7,Haryana farmers not getting price for sugarcane,"YAMUNANAGAR: Sugar which is a major agriculture processing industry in the state of Haryana and the country as a whole continues to face problems. The farmers are not getting remunerative price for sugarcane with the result that the area under sugarcane cultivation is going down.

Recently the Central government announced the Statutory Minimum Price (SMP) for the sugarcane at Rs. 73/- per quintal linked to 8.5 percent recovery against last yearâ€™s of Rs. 69.50 per quintal thereby increasing the SMP by Rs. 3.50 per quintal. However, the Government of Haryana this year continued with the last yearâ€™s State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs. 104/- per quintal for the general variety of cane, Rs. 106/- per quintal for Mid variety of cane and Rs. 110/- per quintal for early variety of cane.

Although the State Advised Price of sugarcane is higher than SMP but the Private Sugar Factories in Haryana are paying the Statutory Minimum Price (SMP) as announced by the Central Government.

When this newsman on Friday contacted V K Sachdeva, the executive director of the Yamuna Nagar Sugar Mill which is the biggest Sugar Mill in India, he informed that inspite of the fact that the sugar industry in India is passing through a difficult phase and the Yamuna Nagar Sugar Mills is no exception to it, but they have been able to make payment to the farmers for the cane purchased by their Mill inspite of the fact that they are carrying a huge stock of 17 Lacs bags of Sugar which includes for 8 Lacs bags of sugar produced in the last season i.e. 2002-03. He further commented that it generally takes 16 to 17 months to sell the sugar from the day it is produced thereby not only adding to their voes by keeping the blocked but also increasing their costs by way of interest on blocked capital. He commented that if the sugar industry in India is to survive, then the solution lies only in encouraging export of sugar and rationalizing the sugarcane price viz-a-viz the price of sugar in the market. He suggested that Government of India should come out with a package for the revitalization of the sugar industry.

Mr. Sachdeva further informed that sugar industry in India has suffered a loss of Rs. 5,000 crores in the last two years and the cane arrears for the cane purchased last season i.e. 2002-03 amounts to Rs. 3,000 crores for the country as a whole whereas in Haryana there are no cane price arrears for the cane purchased in last season. He squarely blamed the Central Government for the sorry state of the sugar industry. He attributed the financial plight of the sugar industry in India to the heavy sugar stocks and interests thereof, the declining sugar prices in the market over the years and the indifferent attitude of the government towards the industry.

In Haryana there are 12 Cooperative Sugar Mills and 3 Private Sugar Mills. The Cooperative Sugar Mills put together will crush 3.4 crore quintals of cane and the 3 Private Sugar Mills will crush around 2.6 crore quintal of cane this year which would mean that Haryana Sugar Mills put together will crush around 6 crore quintals of cane this year out of which 2 crore quintals of cane will be crushed by the Yamuna Nagar Sugar Mill alone.

He said that the Saraswati Sugar Mill, Yamuna Nagar in comparison to the above said State Advised Price is paying Rs. 93.40 for the general variety, Rs. 95.60 for the mid variety and Rs. 99.40 for the early variety of cane.

Sat Pal Kaushik Secretary Haryana Pradesh Congress (I) alleged that Yamuna Nagar Sugar Mill is paying Rs. 10.60 per quintal less than the State Advised price and the other private sugar factories are paying even lower than Yamuna Nagar Mill. He said that it is nothing but an exploitation of the farmers both by the state and the private sugar mills. He further alleged that Centre is not coming forward to take care of the sufferings of the farmers and further suggested that either the state of Centre should come out with a package to pay the farmers for the difference between the State Advised Price and the Statutory Minimum Price. He further said that if the farmers of the private factories are paid the State Advised Price they will be loosers by around Rs. .30 crores. He further criticized the Central Government for having announced 2 packages worth Rs. 578 crores and Rs. 680 crores for the sugarcane growers but doing nothing for the implementation of these packages and disbursement of money to the sugarcane growers.

Kaushik appealed to the Central and the State Governments to make up the difference in price between SAP and SMP immediately as there is great resentment among the sugarcane growers of the private sugar mills for being paid less than the farmers of Cooperative Sugar Mills who are paying State Advised Price for sugarcane which is higher that the price being paid private sugar factories.

8,Water issue heats up Rajkot politics,"RAJKOT: With elections round the corner, city Congress has decided to take on Member of Parliament Vallabh Katheriya and members of legislative assembly from Rajkot over the issue of releasing excess irrigation water from Bhadar dam.

After Mayor Mansukh Chavdaâ€™s recent letter to Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Water Supplies Minister Narottam Patel on the issue, the city Congress President Jaswantsinh Bhatti has now decided to launch a stir.

""The Congress party will meet within a day to decide the future course of action. But we have decided that we are going to geharo the MP Katheriya and also the MLAs, which included the finance minister Vajubhai Vala. Also, the Congress would stage a dharna on the issue. This would include a fast outside the residents of the elected representatives,"" said Bhatti here.

Further alleging the BJP of appeasing the farmers at the cost of Rajkot, he said that the 10-lakh people would not take any water cuts this summer. The state government has continued to release water from Bhadar dam without considering the fact that 70 per cent of Rajkot constituency resided in the city.

Although the state government, in a meeting with the RMC officials, had decided to reserve1150 mcft water of Bhadar dam for Rajkot city the quantity of water in dam as on February 4, 2004 had already reached 707 mcft, Bhatti maintained. According to the information received, another 300 mcft would be released on February 14, said Bhatti, adding, ""We may even go to Bhadar and stop the release of water on February 14.""
