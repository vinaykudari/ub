1,Kerosene was used in burning incident at Bhat village: Probe,"ahmedabad: investigations into the mysterious death of an ex-worker of the mother dairy unit in bhat village have revealed that kerosene was used to burn chaturbhai parmar to death and not lubricating oil as earlier suspected. two months into the incident, the gandhinagar district police has made no arrests yet after a case of murder was lodged against three top officials of the dairy and three security guards, reportedly under ""political pressure"". however, examination of the crime scene by forensic experts confirmed that the inflammable fluid used to set parmar afire was not lubricating oil, but kerosene. samples of soil and other exhibits from the area showed strains of the blue tint in kerosene. this also confirmed that the kerosene used was procured from a public distribution system, said sources. forty-five year old chaturbhai was burnt to death just inside the premises of the mother dairy unit in bhat village early on the morning of august 16 sparking off a controversy on the factory premises with dairy workers and dalit leaders launching an agitation. chaturbhai and 31 others had been removed from their jobs after they failed a qualifying test and were fighting a legal battle against the co-operative. but this discovery has not made the police's task any easier. while the investigations have confirmed that the kerosene sample used to burn chaturbhai matched with the one used in his house, it has not been able to establish ""whether he doused himself with the fluid or someone else did it"". gandhinagar superintendent of police e radhakrishna told tnn on friday ""we have made no arrests as there is no evidence"". investigating officer d r patel said the investigations were still on but the ""motive has not yet been established"". in fact, even after the forensic reports, the police is yet to confirm whether it was a murder or a suicide case, because the immediate provocation, claims the police, is not yet known. apparently, chaturbhai was a ration card holder and ""might probably have brought the container of kerosene,"" noted an official. but there was no way to confirm this since the can had been handled by many persons by then. the lubricating oil theory was ruled out because the oil container was found at quite a distance from the place of the incident. at first, the gandhinagar district police had lodged a case of accidental death and later a case of murder, after violent protests that threatened to spill over into the state assembly which was in session at the time. fearing the incident would boil into a political crisis, the case was lodged on the basis of an eye-witness account reportedly, ""to pacify union leaders"", said sources.

7,Modi to move privilege notice against minister,"patna: the state government's decision not to give reservation facility to backward castes in the municipal elections will put the urban development minister in the soup. for, leader of the opposition in the bihar assembly sushil kumar modi is to make a privilege move against urban development minister sri narayan yadav for allegedly misleading the assembly on reservation facility for the backward castes in the forthcoming municipal elections. addressing a press meet on friday, modi alleged that in his statement made inside the assembly on september 27, the urban development minister was categorical in his statement on the issue of reservation facility for the backward castes in the municipal polls. however, on october 11, the government informed the state election commission (sec) that no reservation facility would be given to them in the municipal elections, modi said. modi stressed that the laloo-rabri regime's love for the backward castes had been exposed in the panchayat polls and the forthcoming municipal polls as the backward castes were denied reservation. ""the social justice preached by laloo is confined to the m-y (muslim-yadav) combination,"" he remarked, insisting that denial of quota had badly hit the prospects of 124 castes under the extremely backward castes (ebcs) category in the panchayat elections. ""in the last panchayat polls, of the 8,500 posts of mukhiyas, only about 125 members of the ebcs were able to win. the ebcs constitute about 35 per cent of the population"", modi stressed. even as the patna high court had struck down annexure-1 (list of backward castes) in 1996, the same list has been added in the bihar municipality act and bihar municipal corporation act to identify the backward castes, modi said, stressing that the high court had asked the state government to form a commission to identify backward castes deserving reservation. ""even after five years, the government has not even formed the commission, nor is it expediting the case in the apex court,"" he remarked, suggesting that the list of 124 castes should be included in the municipal acts. the state government denied reservation to even dalits and women in five municipal corporations of bihar, modi said. ""the social justice propagated by the state government benefits only strong backward castes.the rjd national meet recently demanded the ceiling of the yearly income for being included into the 'creamy layer' should be hiked from rs 1 lakh to rs 5 lakh per annum,"" modi stated.

8,No major change expected in RBI's credit policy,"mumbai: india's debt traders expect the central bank to continue with its steps to improve market depth and trading practices in its mid-year policy review on monday, but no new, radical measures are likely. market players are uncertain about the prospects for a rate cut although many expect rbi to announce some measures to further loosen its easy monetary policy. most expect a reduction in banks' crr, with some holding out hopes that the bank rate may be cut. traders and debt analysts say the central bank has already plotted the course for the markets and systems and the current policy review may just be a report card on the progress made. in recent years, the central bank has replaced part of its fixed rate funding assistance to markets with auction-based repos, created new benchmarks for the fledgling derivatives market and has started work on automating transactions. ""this policy is going to maintain a status quo as far as market systems and practices are concerned,"" said a dealer with a state-run bank. ""there is little point in announcing new intentions until we make some progress on what's been committed."" the rbi's experiment with the liquidity adjustment facility (laf) it introduced last year, to set more market-related rates on its refinance and to ensure it was not taken for granted as a lender of last resort, has been a success. bankers, however, expect the central bank will make refinance against lending to exporters, estimated at around rs 4,000 crore, cheaper to compensate banks for a reduction in export finance rates last month. in the past 12 months, call rates have rarely spiked outside the 2-per cent band between the reverse repo and repo rates at which the central bank lends and borrows from the market.

18,Mulayam castigates BJP for not arresting VHP leaders,"allahabad: samajwadi party chief mulayam singh yadav on saturday castigated the bjp governments at the centre and in state for failure to arrest the leaders of the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) for entering the sanctum sanctorum at the ramjanmabhoomi complex in ayodhya. talking to newsmen here, on the eve of the pubic felicitation of cine star amitabh bachchan, the sp leader accused the government of cover-up tactics by lodging firs only in the matter and demanded the resignation of prime minister and chief minister for their failure to comply with the supreme court directions prohibiting entry of anybody other than the priests performing the puja at the sanctum sanctorum. ``it is yet another attempt of the bjp to drive a wedge between the hindus and muslims and extracting electoral gain out of it'', he said, adding, ``the audacity of vhp members can be imagined from their declaration of storming the temple premises once again at a time when the prime minister demanded a report from the state over the security lapse''. denying that the felicitation of amitabh was an electoral prank of the party, yadav felt a personality who was being honoured throughout the world should certainly be honoured at his birthplace. ruling out the possibility of an electoral alliance with the congress party, the sp chief stated that the bjp and the congress were two sides of the same coin. he also alleged that bin laden was being internally supported by the bjp and ridiculed the release of mercenary masood azhar who was escorted by jaswant singh to the aircraft to ensure his safe passage to freedom. questioning the government's stand of accepting the resignation of george fernandes earlier and then appointing him again as the defence minister, singh sought an explanation from the government about the charges levelled against george and whether investigations absolved him of all the charges to provide him a clean chit. replying to a question on the ban imposed on simi, mulayam reiterated that an all-party meet should be convened to discuss the issue threadbare and then only a stand can be taken. blaming innocent persons for being anti-nationals and isi agents was not fair, he felt. referring to the afghanistan issue, he opined that even if a northern alliance government was formed there it would serve the purpose of the americans more than anything else. ``india is not going to benefit from the situation'', he added. he also decried the state government for ``failure on all fronts of governance'', and stated that the traders, students, farmers and the masses were facing hardships on account of irrational policies of the government.
