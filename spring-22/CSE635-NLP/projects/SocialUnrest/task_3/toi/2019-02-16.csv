0,HSIDC to introduce policy for erring borrowers,"chandigarh: the haryana state industrial development corporation (hsidc) has decided to introduce a one-time settlement policy to provide benefit to defaulting borrowers. the decision was taken by the board of directors of the corporation in a meeting held on friday under the chairmanship of the principal secretary to the chief minister, m k miglani, who is also the chairman of the corporation. the one-time settlement would be done in all loan cases like term loan, working capital term loan, bridge loan etc, miglani said. the policy would cover the doubtful loans where the principal remained overdue for a period exceeding two years. there would be four categories under this scheme.the first category would cover the loan accounts which had remained doubtful for less than three years. in this category, the accounts could be settled by waiving the entire penal interest plus 25 per cent component of compound interest. this waiver would not exceed 25 per cent of the total outstanding. he said that the second category would cover the loan accounts which had remained doubtful for more than three years but less than five years. the benefit permissible under this category is that accounts would be settled by waiving of entire penal interest plus 50 per cent component of compound interest. however, the waiver in this case would not be more than 50 per cent of the total outstanding. the third category covers the loan accounts which had remained doubtful for more than five years. in these cases, the accounts would be settled by waiving off the entire penal interest plus 100 per cent component of compound interest. only those cases would fall in the last category where the primary and collateral securities had already been disposed of by the corporation. there would be no verification of assets and the eligibility under the scheme would not be linked with personal assets of borrowers and guarantors, he said. in order to make the scheme more attractive and customerfriendly, the hsidc has also decided to change the mode of payment of the instalment to pay the amount from monthly to quarterly.

1,Rebels set to spoil BJP's party,"gorakhpur: the rebels are harming the prospects of the bharatiya janata party in the gorakhpur district. so far the leaders have failed to persuade them to accept the party directives.

out of the nine assembly seats in the district, the party has left two seats to its allies -- chillupar for all india loktantrik congress party''s harishankar tiwari and pipraich for jitendra prasad jaiswal alias pappu bhaiyya, who is contesting as an independent candidate. both the candidates were ministers in the rajnath singh government.

on the remaining seven seats the party candidates are facing tough challenge from the rebels. party candidate and minister for rural development shiv pratap shukla is facing the ire of party mp yogi adityanath on the sadar assembly seat. the mp has fielded dr rmd agrawal, as an akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha candidate, against shukla and is actively campaigning in his favour.

the vishwa hindu parishad, which has a office on the premises of gorakhnath temple too is supporting yogi. this has only added to the woes to shukla who has been representing the seat since 1989.

the rebel mp has also pitted deepak agrawal, as hindu mahasabha candidate, against the bjp-supported jitendra prasad jaiswal from pipraich assembly seat.

adding to the woes of the bjp, its sitting mla bechan ram is also contesting as hindu mahasabha candidate from mundera assembly seat. he too has the blessings of the yogi against party candidate shakuntala devi. the fact that bechan ram hails from the same area is working against the party candidate, who is the wife of sultanpur district magistrate. peeved at the party decision few party workers have already shifted their loyalties.

the bjp''s decision to field sitting samajwadi party mla gauri devi has created resentment among the local leaders and workers in the kauriram assembly constituency. gauri is seeking fourth consecutive term from here. agitated over the denial of ticket to the district bjp president upendra singh most of the workers have refused to campaign for her and have shifted to other constituencies to avoid any untoward incident.

the scenario is same in other constituencies of the district, where the rebels are making a dent into the party''s prospects. alarmed at the prospect, the party has decided to rope in the help of star campaigners and the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss). all frontal organisations of the rss have been pressed into service to neutralise the yogi factor on sadar seat. besides, a meeting prime minister atal behari vajpayee has been planned for saturday in the sadar constituency. union minister sushma swaraj and chief minister rajnath singh would also hold public meetings in support of shukla.

apart from them, bjp''s state president kalraj mishra and national general secretary pyare lal khandelwal have already visited the constituency and senior party leader kapil dev had been camping in the district party office for the past several weeks.

2,Terror casts shadow on polls,"barhe, etawah: raja hem rudra singh''s house in the village of barhe overlooks golden yellow mustard fields banking down to the confluence of the yamuna and chambal. but the spectacular landscape is deceptive. for the inhabitants of the narrow strip of land between the chambal ravines and the yamuna that runs through the assembly segments of etawah, lakhna and ajitmal in etawah district, life is very hard. singh, the pradhan of barhe, explains: farming is difficult, the area has few educational establishments and, crucially, no jobs. once, most local youth joined the maharaja of gwalior''s army, after independence, the indian army or police. but no longer. the result: poverty and unemployment have pushed many young men, and even some women such as lovely pandey, into dacoity. but as the social dynamic of the state has changed, so has the caste composition of the gangs. once the gangs were led by thakurs like the legendary malkhan singh or, till recently, brahmins like phakkad alias ramanand tiwari, now in his 80s. most of the current gangs are led by gujjars such as rajjan, nirbhay and salim alias pahalwan. in the past elections, these dacoits would issue appeals on behalf of candidates of their choice. this time, singh says, they all have gone underground because the uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh governments have launched joint operations against them. the result: caught between the dacoits and the police, life has become even tougher for the villagers. singh explains that the villagers can no longer spend the night in their fields to protect their crops from neelgai because they could be picked up by the police for ""harbouring"" dacoits. indeed some 150 boys from the gujjar community, which has a substantial vote in ajitmal, etawah and lakhna, have been picked up by the police in the last few months. this has created much resentment among gujjars. a group of pradhans and ex-pradhans from neighbouring villages arriving in barhe to campaign for the bjp in fact bitterly criticise the local administration even as they also lash out at mayawati and mulayam singh yadav. the ex-pradhan of rachpura even bursts into tears as he talks of innocent gujjar boys in custody. asked how could they seek votes for the bjp while being so critical of the rajnath singh ministry, they say their only hope is a fellow gujjar, hukam singh, currently energy minister in up. says kunwar singh gujjar, ""you need to have a leader from your caste these days."" but later, kunwar singh whispers: ""don''t write anything bad about mulayam singh yadav - he is a good man. but in front of rudra singh - a thakur like rajnath singh - it is not safe to say anything else. in fact, in this area, it is not safe to being seen supporting anyone except the bjp.""

5,"Put more pressure on Pak, BJP tells govt","new delhi: the bharatiya janata party on saturday asked the government to increase pressure on pakistan till it yielded to india''s demands and stopped cross-border terrorism. refusing to spell out what pressure tactics should be adopted, bjp president jana krishnamurthy said that was for the government to do. ""we want more pressure exerted on pakistan, it is for the government to decide how."" commenting on pakistan president pervez musharraf''s recent visit to the us, krishnamurthy said india could not rely on musharraf''s bonafide, as he had reneged on his word time and again.

6,Cracks will show in NDA after UP polls: Singh,"bangalore: former prime minister v p singh on saturday said cracks would appear in nda after the uttar pradesh assembly poll and hit out at prime minister atal behari vajpayee for not raising the issue of defence corruption in his campaign. speaking to reporters here, he said contradictions were inherent in nda and cracks would appear after up poll results. stating that corruption in defence was a serious threat to the nation and its security, singh wondered why vajpayee was silent on this issue in his electioneering. he accused the government of not being interested in defence-related corruption issues being raised, despite the fact that the comptroller and auditor general had brought it out in its report. the threat of corruption in defence was ""act of treason"" and should be punished accordingly, he said. on the ram temple issue, singh said the government had now taken a position which he as prime minister had taken--that the issue should be solved through ""mutual consent"" or by a court verdict. the vhp had given a ""written statement"" agreeing to this but was now bactracking on it, he said. singh, who is here to campaign for former prime minister h d devegowda in the kanakapura lok sabha by-election, said his victory was important for the third front as it would help in its revival. on his recent meeting with congress president sonia gandhi, he said it was to discuss the issue of transparency and accountability in public life.

10,Uphill task for state finance minister,"varanasi: varanasi cantonment, a key city constituency, is heading for a quadrangular fight this time. harischchandra srivastava of bharatiya janata party (bjp), who won the seat in the last elections, is facing a tough contest from shatrudha prakash of congress, manoj rai of samajwadi party (sp) and abhishek yadav alias guddu yadav of bahujan samaj party (bsp).

though the sp and bsp candidates are contesting their maiden assembly elections, but they are capable of affecting harishchandra''s poll prospects. the constituency which has about 3.39 lakh voters is dominated by kurmis, yadavs and bhumihars. the muslims are in the majority at lohata area of the segment.

candidates of different parties are leaving no stone unturned to woo the electorate. while harishchandra is not missing any opportunity to highlight works carried out by him in the area, shatrudha, in an apparent bid to belittle the minister''s efforts, has raised a demand for a white paper on the expenditure incurred by him in various developmental projects here. manoj is trying to convince the electorate that the sp is committed to improve their living standards and abhishek is striving to gain the voters'' support by telling them that the bsp is the only party which sincerely works for the uplift of the poor and the downtrodden.

the cantonment segment has been a stronghold of bjp since 1991. shatrudha too has represented the seat in vidhan sabha for four times but not on the congress ticket. he was elected in 1974 on the bharatiya kranti dal ticket and on the janata party symbol in 1997. he was the lok dal candidate when he won the seat in 1985 and in 1989 he was elected on the janata dal ticket. he was defeated in 1991 by bjp''s jyotsna srivastava, wife of harishchandra. but after making a hat-trick from here she left the seat for her husband in 1996.

the plus point for shatrudha is his image of a `leader of the soil''. he has a good following in the city suburbs. however, this time he is focussing on new colonies which are considered to be the stronglehold of bjp.

meanwhile, the bsp candidate, who claims to have support of bhumihars, is all set to make a dent in the yadav vote bank of sp. he is giving sleepless nights to manoj who is trying to keep his yadav votes intact. the muslim voters have yet to open their cards.

in all, 16 candidates, including four independents, are in the fray here. in 1996 assembly elections, the sp candidate was declared runner-up. the congress candidate too stood at the second spot in the 1999 parliamentary elections.

11,CM addresses election rally in Sarsaul,"kanpur: addressing a huge public meeting in sarsaul assembly segment, chief minister raj nath singh said that the bharatiya janata party''s supported the issue of farmers'' upliftment and wanted a stable government in uttar pradesh. projecting himself as a farmer, singh claimed that during his short tenure as chief minister of uttar pradesh, the bjp government had vindicated his pro-farmers approach.

singh, projected by the bjp as the next cm of the bjp government in the state, supported lok janshakti party state president dr ram ashray kushwaha. dr kushwaha also made scathing attacks on the expensive campaigning of the congress, samajwadi party and the bsp.

targetting the casteist character of the samajwadi party and bhaujan samaj party, the bjp leader said that these parties were dividing society for their personal benefit and claimed that the bjp government during its regime of over five years broke all barriers of caste and creed.

singh said that the samajwadi party chief who claimed himself to be the messiah of farmers was opposing this pro-farmer decision of the government for his political benefit.

singh, besides, claimed that his government had purchased a record amount of wheat and rice in uttar pradesh to maintain the price of these grains in the market. singh claimed that the opposition was out of an issue and was therefore projecting its frustrations on the bjp and blaming it for lack of issues.

he assured the gathering that the bjp would form the next government in uttar pradesh on its own. he also claimed that for the first time farmers had received value for their products. he said that if voted again to power in uttar pradesh, he would connect all the villages with electricity and provide maximum electricity.

15,"Naidu pat for Buddha, flak for party","kolkata: in a clear effort to drive a wedge between buddhadeb bhattacharjee and his party - the cpm - bjp leader and union minister venkaiya naidu praised the administrative acumen of the chief minister and said that his government was more civilized than that of his predecessor jyoti basu. naidu also said that the cpm was putting pressure on bhattacharjee forcing him to retracted from the correct path he had chosen to tread. ""bhattacharjee has come recently and is behaving decently,"" naidu said in kolkata on friday. ""his government is much more civilized than that of jyoti basu,"" he observed. but naidu was full of criticism of bhattacharjee''s party, the cpm, which, the bjp leader felt, was making the state administration a casualty. cpm state secretary anil biswas reacted sharply to naidu''s remarks and claimed that buddhadeb bhattacharjee''s government was nothing but a continuation of the jyoti basu''s government. denying that his party had ever mounted pressure on bhattacharjee to retract his steps, biswas said, ""there is no such pressure from the party. whatever he is doing is a political decision."" naidu, however, observed that the cpm had forced bhattacharjee to retract his statement that a section of unrecognised madrasahs were engaged in anti-national activities in the state. ""the left should keep away its vote bank policy in the interest of national security. bhattacharjee''s initiative against unrecognised madrasahs was derailed by his party. by doing so, the cpm is gaining support of neither the minorities nor the majority,"" naidu said. he also observed that the central cpm leadership had opposed bhattacharjee''s move to introduce poca in the state. sharply criticising naidu''s observations, the cpm state secretary said, ""naidu had said before the assembly polls that lawlessness was the highest in west bengal. now he admits that the government is civilized. this only proves that his earlier observation was incorrect."" biswas also challenged naidu''s observation that the outcome of the ongoing assembly elections in five states would have no impact on the future of the nda government at the centre. ""they have come to realize that they will lose the elections on punjab and uttar pradesh. the results will definitely have a moral impact on the central government and will prove that the bjp''s support base is eroding.""

17,Double murder sparks violence in city,"lucknow: the police on friday morning lathi-charged the infuriated mob protesting outside the hassanganj police station. the mob fury which was sparked by the murder of two minor siblings, left four cycle rickshaws and a scooter reduced to ashes.

violence broke out after urban development minister lalji tandon reached the hassanganj police station to address the protesting residents. the residents were demanding action against officials of the police station for their laxity in investigations. this apathy had led to the murder of two minor children abducted by their school rickshaw-pullers on thursday. the police had recovered the bodies of ayush and mansi late on thursday night.

21,Local govt bodies oppose elevation,"mumbai: an in-built resistance to change has prevented many state civic bodies that qualify to be nagar panchayats from redesignating themselves as such.

the new category, which applies to areas that are in transition from rural to urban, was introduced last year. thus far, only two nagar panchayats exist in maharashtra__in shirdi, near nashik, and dapoli in ratnagiri district.

there are many local bodies in the state that meet the conditions of a nagar panchayat but continue to be recognised as village panchayats or municipal councils.

a nagar panchayat is officially defined as an area in transition from a gram panchayat to a municipal council. the maharashtra municipal councils act, 1965, says that an area with a population between 10,000 and 25,000, more than 25 per cent of whom are engaged in non-agricultural activities, could qualify as a nagar panchayat.

both dapoli (population 10,412) and shirdi (population 26,169) were village panchayats before they were upgraded to nagar panchayats last year.

shirdi''s transition was a stormy affair because it was sought to be elevated to a municipal council. officials say panchayat members opposed elections at every step till it was decided to convert it into its present form, a notch lower than a municipal council. there has been no local body election in shirdi since the state election commission was formed in 1994.

many local government bodies in the state have opposed plans to elevate their civic status. municipal councils such as jalgaon, ahmednagar, dhule and mira-bhayandar have gone to court against the notification seeking to convert them into municipal corporations.

though a higher civic designation translates into better infrastructure, such conversions are often opposed for economic and political reasons, a state election commission official says. ``taxes are higher in a higher civic authority,'''' he says. ``then again, with each upgraded status, political power decreases in inverse proportion to that of the administrative machinery.''''

he says that in the case of a municipal corporation, the mayor is a mere figurehead while the municipal commissioner enjoys the real powers.

among the smallest municipal councils are chikhaldara, a tiny hill-station in amravati district, with a population of about 4,400, and panhala, also a hill station in kolhapur district, with a population of 3,500. the population in these council areas is far lower than the stipulated minimum population of 25,000 for a `c'' class municipal council.

if these places have managed to retain their status, it is because of the state government''s decision to freeze their designations in 1994. recognising that a realignment would create more problems than it could solve, the state government notified these areas as ``deemed'''' to have fulfilled the conditions of a municipal council, says urban development secretary ramanand tiwari.

a municipal council, which ranks lower than a corporation, has a president as the political appointee in place of the mayor, and it is he who writes the annual confidential record of the chief executive, the highest administrative post. this clearly makes a council more palatable to political parties, he explains.

24,Modi's G-8 move scares 'weak' ministers,"gandhinagar: chief minister narendra modi has in his latest circular shown a clear preference for eight members of the 39-member ministry, asking them to deal with all important issues and even major policy matters on his behalf in the ensuing assembly session. issued on thursday, the circular asks finance minister nitin patel to answer all questions related to the narmada dam, including policy matters. this is a clear departure from the practice of allowing the irrigation minister to do the job. nitin would present the budget on february 27. two other ministers who have been shown favour are agriculture minister purshottam rupala and urban development minister i k jadeja. while rupala has been asked to take up all issues related to the government administration, jadeja would deal with information and broadcasting, ports, mines and minerals. both have also been modi''s cabinet spokesmen for the past two months. the assembly session work begins on february 26. other ministers who would be answerable on the cm''s behalf are - industries minister suresh mehta, on industrial policy; narottam patel, on planning policy; kaushik patel, on energy policy; gordhan zadaphia, on law and order policy; and hemant chapatwala, on higher education and science and technology policy. science and technology is slated to be a new department. modi has kept with himself all policy portfolios while distributing ministries soon after he took over on october 7. the list of the preferred eight comes amidst strong apprehensions in the corridors of power that modi might cut his ministry to 20 soon after the rajkot bypoll on february 21 confirms his chief ministership. twenty was the number he wanted to reach while forming his ministry before october 7. it became jumbo-sized, thanks to political pressure and compulsions. those not in good books of modi particularly fear the ''tough measure'' could go against them.

26,Charges politically motivated: V-C,"patiala: ved parkash gupta, president, district congress committee (dcc) patiala, addressing a press conference here on friday, demanded a thorough probe and registration of criminal cases against punjabi university vicechancellor jasbir singh ahluwalia for the allegations made against him by female students, besides charges of misrule and grave irregularities. the v-c trying to give a new turn to the episode, has issued press note in which he claimed that the stepped-up campaign against him was politically and ideologically motivated. he demanded that his administrative powers be withdrawn immediately and the proposed syndicate meeting scheduled for february 24 be postponed, as the vc was planning to get his misdeeds regularised and to take steps against the people who were allegedly against his working. on the other hand, the akhil bhartiya vidiaarthi parishad, students federation of india and punjab students union, in a meeting here on friday at nehru park, formed a joint action committee which would meet the governor punjab on monday to demand a cbi inquiry into the saru rana episode and other alleged irregularities committed during his tenure by suspending him. trying to present himself as a vajpayee loyal on one hand and attacking the rss on the other, ahluwalia said that since his joining as vice-chancellor, he realised that the hard core rss elements, opposed to the liberal vajpayee line -- had a hidden agenda of saffronisation of the entire educational system, coupled with infiltration among the teachers, students and non-teaching staff, with the idea of fomenting trouble, blackmailing and coercing the authorities into toeing their line, or to force them out. ahluwalia said the root cause of his confrontation with a cabinet minister in the badal government was his determination to stop the politico-ideological infiltration in the university. the vice-chancellor had locked horns with him on the basis of his ph.d registration, alleging that the minister had submitted ghost-written synopsis. the vice-chancellor said the rss elements had been feeling uncomfortable with him due to his efforts to get derogatory remarks (against sikhism) deleted from ncert books, his turning down the proposal to introduce a course on astrology in the university and his opposition to install the dasam granth along with the hindu deities in the mandirs. on the saru rana case ""adopted"" by the akhil bhartiya vidyarthi parishad, the vc said it was part of their campaign against him. on the ""frequent outbursts"" of amarjit dhillon of the fear, he said he had ordered to get an fir registered in a criminal case in connection with an alleged ""scam"" of millions of rupees, in which dhillon had also ""figured"", according to the university record. he also levelled other charges against dhillon. when contacted, dhillon said that ahluwalia was trying to divert the attention from the real issues raised by saru rana.
