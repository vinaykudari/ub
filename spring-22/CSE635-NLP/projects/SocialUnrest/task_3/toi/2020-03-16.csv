0,Power tariffs set to increase from April 1,"BANGALORE: Power tariffs for all metered consumers will go up by 10 paise per unit from April 1, with the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation (KPTC) deciding to notify the hike in the last week of March.

The tariff hike order was passed by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) on March 10, but was not notified immediately as the KPTC wanted a review of the order. ""We are still filing a review petition by March 18 or 19 asking for a bigger hike in tariffs. But, after discussions, we decided we should notify the given hike immediately, so that we do not lose revenue till the review petition is heard,"" KPTC managing director KN Shrivastava told The Times of India.

KPTC delayed notifying the 2002 tariff order for three months, awaiting government sanction. This led to an additional revenue gap of Rs 190 crore as the revised tariff was not collected for three months. When the KPTC filed a review petition asking for this additional amount, the KERC rejected it.

The issue of restricting transmission and distribution losses to 28 per cent will also be raised. KPTC will also ask the KERC to look at its plan to link tariffs with the monsoons.

1,"Follow traffic rules, police tell revellers","PUNE: Revellers violating traffic rules on the occasion of Holi and Rangpanchami will be dealt with strictly, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) has warned. Rash driving or driving under the influence of alcohol on Holi and Rangpanchami days (March 18 and 23) lead to accidents, hence the measure, said DCP Ravindra Sengaonkar in a statement on Sunday.

Those found overspeeding/rash driving will be fined Rs 500 under section 112/183 of the Motor Vehicle Act, he warned. The police will detain vehicle drivers on suspicion and ask them to undergo a medical test for alcohol consumption. If a person is proved to be under the influence of alcohol, he/she will be liable for six months of simple imprisonment or a fine of Rs 2,000 or both.

This, even if the vehicle driver has a permit to consume alcohol, the statement said. Sengaonkar has also urged vehicle drivers to carry the registration book, tax certificate, licence, insurance certificate and the PUC certificate. Those found not carrying the same will be fined separately.

Vehicle drivers indulging in blowing of horns unnecessarily or talking on mobile phones while driving will be also fined. The police will install barricades at important junctions in the city to restrict the speed of vehicles, the statement added.

2,Private dairies milk farmers,"BANGALORE: Aggressive marketing by private milk companies, most of whom upstarts, has cut into the market share of the Karnataka Milk Federation, a co-operative, leaving poor farmers in dire straits.

The milk market in Bangalore is churning, and churning furiously if an array of brands â€” Heritage, Tirumala, Arokya, Swastik, Balaji and Krishna â€” adorning the shelves of neighbourhood parlour is any indication.

Some of the names are familiar and others not so, but the game plan chalked out by them has more or less the same script: Create a cartel, buffet the agents with a creamy commission and make hay. Sources in the industry said the triad of dealers, shopkeepers and agents dictate the terms and itâ€™s the sellersâ€™ market all the way.

Ever since the private dairies forayed into Bangalore about four years ago, the KMF has been on its toes to keep its business intact. Five years ago, the KMF sold 15.5 lakh litres of milk and curds across the state, which has now dwindled to 15 lakh. In percentage terms, the KMF is steadily losing market.

Conceding that private players are eyeing the urban segment including some big towns in North Karnataka, KMF director H. Channegowda says: ""The KMF has had to get market-savvy."" And it has.

Brushing aside the challenge posed by upstarts, Nilgiris dairy unit director C. Kumar says: ""Weâ€™ve a committed clientele.We donâ€™t believe in undercutting."" Another key player, Heritage, procures milk from southern Andhra Pradesh districts such as Chittoor and Anantapur at a price relatively lower.

The neophytes have had to get a headstart in the already saturated market by playing out new rules and offered to the agents commissions as high as Re 1 a litre against the KMFâ€™s 30 paise a litre. ""This is a temporary phase.

The private operators cannot keep this up for long,"" says Channegowda. Its upbeat note notwithstanding, the KMFâ€™s constituent unit Bangalore Dairy has been losing its hold over the market with the sale of its flagship brand, Nandini, selling 4.1 lakh of litres now against 5.1 lakh litres four years ago.

The KMF share in the Bangalore pie has plunged 60 per cent in many areas. With upstart dairies throwing the niceties of game to the winds to remain in the fray, the humble shareholders of KMF â€” farmers, who are often single cow owners â€” have been left to fend for themselves.

3,Ayodhya prince holds key to the vexed issue,"AYODHYA: Former prince of the Ayodhya Estate Raja Bimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra, who played a key role in toning down the much-hyped â€˜shiladaanâ€™ last year, firmly believes the vexed issue could be resolved amicably forever if left to the people of the temple town.

The low-profile 47-year-old prince, popularly known as â€˜pappu bhaiyaâ€™ and â€˜raja sahebâ€™, is highly respected among both Hindus and Muslims in Ayodhya for his apolitical stand and has even been approached by Kanchi Shankaracharya and Muslim leaders, including Syed Shahabuddin, to launch a peace initiative. â€œIf left to the Muslims and Hindus of Ayodhya and Faizabad, the issue would be settled in no time,â€� he told reporters in an interview at his sprawling palace in the heart of the temple town.

He, however, believes it was high time the temple is allowed to be built at the â€˜undisputedâ€™ site as the â€˜people of Ayodhya are the worst sufferersâ€™ (a stand welcomed even by a hardline Muslim leader like Shahabuddin of All-India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat). â€œWe would like to assure you that the Muslim community has no objection to the construction of the proposed mandir on the undisputed land. Its objection is limited to the Babri Masjid site and the waqf land around it being included in the mandir site plan,â€� Shahabuddin said in a letter to the Raja immediately after the â€˜shiladanâ€™ last year. Offering his solution, Mishra said â€œwhere else will Ram temple be built other than Ayodhya. Let the construction start from an undisputed part of the complex and let a dialogue take place simultaneously.

We will all accept if the Supreme Court gives any verdict in the meantimeâ€�. Mishra along with Lucknow divisional commissioner Navneet Sehgal had played a key role in persuading Nyas leader Ramchandra Dass to agree to a toned down â€˜shiladaanâ€™ ceremony at Ayodhya on March 15. Little known to the outside world, Mishra, among the handful of â€˜Brahmin princesâ€™ in the country, also facilitated a meeting between the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and Hindu religious leaders to resolve the issue prior to the demolition of the disputed structure. However, the meeting proved to be a failure.

4,Dowry death: IPS officer evades arrest,"LUCKNOW: A senior IPS officer has managed to avoid disciplinary action even when found guilty under the Dowry Act by a sessions court of Delhi, taking advantage of technicalities of the law.

A 1989 batch officer, Mahendra Modi was found guilty a fortnight ago by the sessions court of Delhi of having committed the crime while posted at Kanpur, nearly six years ago. The court sentenced him to four yearsâ€™ imprisonment and a fine. The judgment was communicated to the state government for necessary action. The case against the official was filed by his wifeâ€™s relatives when she was found dead in mysterious circumstances.

The case, filed at a court in Kanpur, was transferred to a Delhi court on the request made by his inlaws, according to an official of the home department. In the meantime, the court put the judgment in abeyance till April 20 ostensibly to allow him to file an appeal in the high court. Taking advantage of this technicality, the official, who is at present posted at the 47th battalion of PAC, Ghaziabad, knocked at the doors of the high court against the sessions courtâ€™s verdict and got a temporary stay. The high court has also admitted his petition.

With the court stay, the official managed to convince the government to drop the idea of action against him. An official, however, said that the government was awaiting a ruling from the court so that it could proceed against the official. Meanwhile, several organisations of women have urged the government to take action against the official, saying that the courtâ€™s stay does not minimise the gravity of the crime.

5,"At last, ministers' panel finds time to meet","BANGALORE: The cabinet subcommittee set up to report on the CET admissions wrangle is yet to decide on the final fee structure: the main issue in the tussle between private college managements and the Karnataka government.

The committee will hold its first meeting on Monday, the day on which it was supposed to have submitted its report. The panelâ€™s discussions will be based on a report submitted by additional chief secretary JP Sharma, who has examined the economics of running professional colleges in the state.

Sources say that though the committee has recommended a relatively high fee structure ranging between Rs 1.8 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh for first year MBBS, the college managements are insisting on Rs 3 lakh.

The Supreme Court has directed the states to standardise fee structures across colleges and desist from fixing different fees for merit and payment seats. This is the crux of the problem. ""With a high fee structure, it will be impossible for the government to retain many free/merit seats as it will cost the state exchequer heavily,"" a senior minister said.

According to official estimates, the subsidy bill for the government will be Rs 20-25 crore a year. ""Over four years, the government will have to expend Rs 80 crore. Whether the government is in a position to spend so much for subsidising higher education is the biggest question now,"" another minister noted. Added to this is the new regulation from the Medical Council of India barring private medical colleges from using government hospital facilities. ""College managements will now have to build hospitals. This expenditure will be reflected on the studentâ€™s fee, which will in turn be billed to us. So seat- sharing is no longer an issue; the main problem is only the fees,"" sources said.

6,Nepal seeks investment from Indian businessmen,"KOLKATA: Nepal wants investments from Indian businessmen in multi-purpose water resources development projects, consul-general of Nepal in Kolkata Yuba Raj Bhusal told TNN recently.

According to Bhusal, such investments will also help India overcome the thermalhydel imbalance in electricity in the eastern Indian states. Bhusal said: ""Nepal is a power surplus state and ranks second after Brazil. But, at present the country is generating only 500 MW of hydro-electricity while it has the potential to produce 83,000 MW of hydel power."" Bhusal said that Nepal had already entered into a multi-purpose investment treaty with India. ""This will help in the export of hydro-electricity to Bengal, Bihar and Orissa,"" he said.

Compared to an ideal thermal-hydel mix of 60:40, 97 per cent of power plants in eastern India are thermal, with only three per cent hydel. This leads to a problem of managing demand for power during the evening peak hours. Nepal has a number of unutilised rivers which include Koshi, Bagmati, Kamal, Gandaki, Rapti, Karnali and Mechi.

According to the Nepalese consul-general, if dams are constructed on these rivers for generating hydro-electricity, they would also result in preventing the flash floods that plague large parts of Bihar almost every year.

Bhusal explained that the Nepalese government was ready to offer various incentives for Indian businessmen willing to invest in Nepal.

7,"Transporters to protest petrol, diesel price hike","MUMBAI: Transporters in Maharashtra plan to stage dharnas outside offices of state-owned oil companies to protest against the frequent and ''arbitrary'' increase in petrol and diesel prices.

In step with the firming up of global crude oil prices, the oil companies hiked petrol and diesel prices from Saturday midnight. In Mumbai, a litre of petrol will now cost Rs 38.59 as opposed to prevailing Rs 37.08. The price of diesel was hiked by Rs 1.09 per litre to Rs 27.88.

The Maharashtra Truck and Transport Owners''Association has decided to hold a meeting of its members on Monday to chalk out programmes for protesting against the price hike.

Association''s president Daljit Singh Bal said, ""The hike has affected the transport industry and plying commercial vehicles is no longer a profitable business.""

He said that transporters suffered losses and were unable to pay road tax, instalments on loan and salaries to staff. If oil prices do not fall, the All-India confederation of goods vehicles owners'' association will observe a bandh from the midnight of April 13, said a confederation spokesperson.

8,BJP chief says no to early polls,"KOLKATA: The Lok Sabha elections will not be advanced to 2003 as anticipated, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu said in Kolkata on Sunday.

They would be held as scheduled in October 2004. ""There is no proposal pending either before the BJP or the NDA to bring ahead the schedule of the general elections to 2003, although there is a rumour. They will be held according to the schedule,"" he said, addressing a workshop on panchayat elections of the West Bengal unit of the party.

The BJP would use the intervening period to strengthen its organisation in villages and win more assembly elections, he said. Attributing the loss in the Himachal Pradesh elections to internal feuds within the state unit of the party, he said, ""politics is not a one-day cricket match, it is a series and we will win it."" Citing BJPâ€™s result in the Nagaland

Assembly polls as a ""sterling performance in a state where the name â€˜BJPâ€™ was an anathema and where 90 per cent of the people are Christians."" He said ""our next target is to win the panchayat polls in West Bengal, the Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and then win over 300 seats in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls."" He said ""good governance"" and ""development"" would be the agenda of the BJP in the next election, but hastened to add that the party had not budged from its Hindutva stance, including the issues of uniform civil code, Ram temple construction, and cow slaughter. ""The BJPâ€™s stand is that the temple must be built there,"" he said, ""but the NDA government has a different agenda. It says that the courtâ€™s verdict must be accepted.""

The thrust of Naiduâ€™s attack was against the Congress, though he lambasted the CPM for ""misrule"" and demanded a CBI probe into the Dhantala incident. Meanwhile, state BJP leader Rahul Sinha thanked state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty making available to the party for three days a hall inside the Salt Lake stadium complex, though there were other programmes scheduled for the day. ""We must thank him even if he is a communist,"" he said.

9,Raped minor girl commits suicide,"HYDERABAD: A 12-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped by her elder cousin on Monday last, immolated self soon after. The girl, who was rushed to a private hospital with burns died on Sunday.

The girl, a resident of Sanjaynagar in Jubilee Hills, was apparently raped by her 22-year-old cousin Srinivas on last Monday. Srinivas lived next door. He raped her when she was alone at home.

Finding that the girl''s parents were out of station, Srinivas apparently called the girl when she was drawing water from a well. Srinivas, under some pretext, took the girl inside her house and raped her.

The same evening, the girl set herself ablaze. She was rushed to the St Theresa''s Hospital in Erragadda by Srinivas'' parents. Soon after admitting the girl to the hospital, Srinivas and his family fled from their house.

The Jubilee Hills police, who were called by the hospital authorities, took the girl''s statement the same afternoon. However, initially the badly injured girl was reluctant to talk against her cousin.

""When we spoke to the girl for the first time at the hospital, she said that she was injured in a gas stove explosion,"" an officer said.

However, when her parents returned to the city the next day and met their daughter at the hospital, the girl told them about the rape.

Her father, Balchander, a stone-cutter, told the police and the police took a detailed statement from the girl.

The girl underwent treatment for almost a week at the hospital. Police have booked a rape case against Srinivas and might add the section pertaining to abetment of suicide. They are on the lookout for Srinivas.

11,Marandi to support leader chosen by party,"RANCHI: Babulal Marandi, who resigned as Jharkhand chief minister, said on Monday he would support any leader chosen by the BJP as its legislature party leader while maintaining that he had resigned on his own and not been removed from his post.

""Nobody has removed me. Even last night BJP president Venkaiah Naidu asked me not to put in my papers. But the events over the last 15 to 20 days compelled me to think otherwise,"" Marandi told a press conference after submitting his resignation letter to Governor M Rama Jois.

""I am moved by the love and respect shown by my legislators and Central party leadership who did not agree to my decision till the last minute,"" he said.

Marandi said that he had also handed over his resignation as leader of the BJP''s legislature party to Jharkhand BJP chief Abhayakant Prasad at 5:00 am Monday morning.

Asked whether rebel ministers would now return, Marandi said ""They should. Their demand for leadership change has been met.""

Apologising to legislators if he had hurt them inadvertently, Marandi said he had ruled the state abiding by rules, adding ""but when a person tries to do it the other way round, problems start to creep in.""

14,Andhra HC permits VHP to hold rally,"HYDERABAD: Amid high drama, Andhra Pradesh High Court on Monday granted permission to VHP for holding its proposed public meeting at Anantapur town, hours after its General Secretary Praveen Togadia was taken into preventive custody while he was on his way to attend the rally.

Acting on a petition filed by VHP, Justice Somayajulu allowed the public meeting, scheduled to be held at Anantapur later in the evening, on the condition that it should conclude by 8.30 pm.

16,"Govt to reveal policy on Star, foreign channels","NEW DELHI: At its meeting on Tuesday the Union cabinet is likely to come out with a clearly-defined policy on wholly owned foreign television companies seeking uplinking permission for India-focused news channels.

Responding to the Star News Broadcasting Ltd. application for starting its Hindi and English channels to cater to a predominantly Indian clientele, the cabinet in all probability will cap the quantum of foreign participation anywhere between 26 and 49 per cent.

In other words, the majority stake in such a venture has to be held by an Indian partner. Looking for a solution to the sensitive issue the cabinet is likely to be guided by the note prepared by the information and broadcasting ministry for this purpose.

The I&B note has understandably suggested that either such news channels be put on a par with the print media in the FDI regime at a 26 per cent cap or allowed 49 per cent foreign equity as in the telecom sector.

The note, sources claim, reflects the views and concerns expressed by a number of ministries consulted on the issue. Within the government a strong opinion prevails that given the impact of such news channels on public opinion there is a need for adopting the maximum safeguards.

In fact, the cabinet decision in a sense will amount to relooking at the existing uplinking policy, which has placed the minimum restrictions on the players.

""Of late we felt the need to take a closer look at the policy and found that everywhere else there are heavy restrictions on news channels,"" remarked an official. In this context he referred to the uplinking policy in America, which had left no choice for media tycoon Rupert Murdoch but to accept US citizenship to spread his television empire over there.

The Star application seems to have set a trend with several other television groups having subsequently lined up for similar uplinking permission. The new policy will be applicable to all such prospective news channels.

One persistent concern influencing the policy is that for security. The ministries of home and defence in giving their opinions particularly called for adequate safeguards for security reasons.

Explaining the urgency for reviewing the policy the I&B ministry said that the need arose since for the first time a company, registered abroad with all its directors being foreigners, had sought to enter the 24-hour news segment with its focus on India.

17,MLA leads protest against school,"AHMEDABAD: Junagadh MLA Mahendra Mashru (BJP) got dragged into a controversy for staging a protest against donations outside Carmel Convent School in Junagadh on Saturday.

In a memorandum to Junagadh SP S S Trivedi, the school authorities stated that they had taken the parents of the students into confidence about the contributions to build a separate kindergarten section.

""But on March 11, they came as a group and barged into the premises demanding a clarification about the contributions,"" the memorandum said. The demonstrations continued on the next few days, and on Saturday, a group headed by Mashru and other BJP leaders reportedly staged a protest fast as their supporters resorted to sloganeering.

The memorandum alleged that the group also videographed the entire episode. Although Mashru was not available for comment, police sources said that the group was led by Mashru and BJP leaders Pradeep Khimani and Nirbhay Purohit.

When contacted, Trivedi said, ""The principal was away, but the school authorities refused to meet even the MLA."" According to him, this sparked off the demonstrations. Trivedi added, ""An MLA is a representative of the people and the school authorities should have met him.""

Junagadh collector R K Pathak was then called in, and the matter was settled. According to the school authorities, they had asked for a contribution of Rs 5,000 per student for the KG section so that students of the higher secondary section could be accommodated in the same building.

18,HC asks state to list steps against labour minister,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday sought an explanation,within two weeks,from the state govern-ment on the action taken against a state minister who was the former chairperson of the Shindkheda sugar co-operative in north Maharashtraâ€™s Dhule district, for defaulting on the Rs 38-crore state-backed loan amount.

The minister concerned is minister of state for labour Dr Hemant Deshmukh.

In order to ascertain the stateâ€™s earnestness,a division bench headed by Justice Hemant Gokhale wanted to know whether the state had initiated any prosecution,if required, against Dr Deshmukh and other directors of the sugar coop-erative for defaulting on pay-ments to private financial in-stitutions which had lent funds for his sugar cooperative.

The bench was hearing a petition filed by the state which had challenged the or-der of the debt recovery appellate tribunal.

The state government had in 1992 stood guarantor to a Rs 14-crores loan given by In-frastructure Finance Corpo-ration of India (IFCI) Bank, IDBI and ICICI to the Shind-kheda sugar co-operative.

The state said the financial institutions after disbursing Rs 12.5 crores had cancelled the loan agreement and stopped further disburse-ment in 1997. In 1998,the sugar co-operative went into liq-uidation and a liquidator was appointed.

In 2000,the IFCI and others filed a suit in the DRT for recovery of the loan amount and the interest ac-crued on it.

The DRT had July 2001 ordered the state and the sugar co-operative repay the loan to the financial institutions. The state had appealed against the DRTâ€™s order before the appellate tribu-nal, which on January 17, 2003,directed it to deposit 29 crores within eight weeks as a condition precedent hearing its appeal.
