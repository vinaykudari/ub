1,No govt returned our lands: Gadar revolutionaries,"jalandhar:was our partici-pation in the revolution, raising our voice against the british regime and years spent in exile worth it, wonders baba bhagat singh bilga, the oldest living gad-darite. then, the indian government did not even care to get back our lands and properties attached by the british rulers. our families were left homeless. even the suc-cessive governments in punjab did nothing. for the gaddar revolu-tionaries, who came back to their villages after spending their youth behind bars, began another strug-gle, of begging the government of-ficials to return their land and property, he added. they were criminals under british law, but freedom fighters under the indian rule. even the successive punjab governments paid only lip service and made promises to get their properties re-turned. it's election time again, and time for another round of promis-es that were never fulfilled, says baba bilga. the baba recalls the life of baba harnam singh of kalasanghian village whose property was auc-tioned by the british government, and how he struggled to get it back in his lifetime and failed. his grandson surinder singh, recalls the election promises of leaders like partap singh kairon and even parkash singh badal in his first stint in power. even when inder kumar gujral got elected from the jalandhar parliamentary seat, he had promised that the land and property of baba harnam singh would be returned as he had made sacrifices for the country's free-dom. however, like the others, he too forgot about it. you can imag-ine how it must have felt for his family to see their house being auctioned along with their trea-sured objects, says surinder singh. what do i do with an award. our lands have not been returned to us. ask the president if the gov-ernment would return our land and property, baba harnam singh is said to have told the man who had accompanied him to the stage where then president vv giri was awarding tamar pattars to stalwarts engaged in the free-dom struggle. no, that can be tak-en up later, the man replied. this was the brief dialogue surinder singh recalls that his grandfather had on the stage while waiting to be honoured with a tamar patar in 1972. once kairon had assured him a pension hike of rs 150, which the baba refused to forget. land is the most precious thing for a jat. he had already paid a heavy price for his revolutionary acts, said surinder singh. and what were the objects of love that were auctioned by the british government officials along with 17 acres of land and the house in kalasanghian village, which now falls in kapurthala village under an akali minister at present? when i came back from argentina after collecting money to build this deshbhagat yaadgar hall, i decid-ed to call over the great gaddarite to inaugurate it. but, our messen-ger found that he had died that very day, recalls baba bilga.

2,No proposal to put off polls: Badal,"chandigarh:there is no pro-posal to postpone the vidhan sab-ha elections in the three border dis-tricts of punjab in view of the heightened tension on the border with pakistan. chief minister parkash singh badal said, on tuesday, he was hopeful that the situation would normalise by the time elections are held. however, if the crisis on the border persisted, the situation could be reviewed by the election commission, he said. badal said he did not see any possibility of rapprochement with gurcharan singh tohra because of the the latter's ''stubborn'' attitude. the chief minister, however, sought to dismiss the idea that the panthic morcha could harm electoral prospects of the sad-bjp alliance. he saw no justification in pre-senting himself before akal takht, as demanded by tohra, because he was not a ''criminal''. he said the second list of candidates would be announced on wednesday, he said, and his party was holding talks with the bsp on seat-sharing.

5,Satara museum suffers from govt negligence,"satara: cobwebs, mildewed walls, worn out carpets, shabby wallpapers and foul smell could be just a few words to describe the shri chhatrapati shivaji maharaj museum in satara managed by the state department of archaeology and museums.constructed with the aim to revive and reveal the varied culture and lifestyle of the 17th and 18th centuries, the museum was inaugurated in 1970 by the then union home minister y. b. chavan in the presence of chhatrapati sumitraraje bhosale.sprawling across a 44,000 sq ft built-up area, the museum is a perfect example of government negligence. divided in two sections, it has four main galleries for weapons, inscriptions, paintings and textile.assistant curator bhaskar madhav mehendale, who has been associated with the museum since its inception, says the collection of old articles began in the 60's. ``in fact, this is the only museum housing chhatrapati shivaji maharaj's takth (throne) from raigad,'' he claims.the weapons gallery has nearly 385 arms. the picture gallery has around 246 pictures, including glass paintings, miniature paintings, wall paintings and transparencies from the 17th and 18th centuries. likewise, the textile gallery has around 231 intricately carved zari works. some of them embedded in pure gold and silver. however, reality showcases a contrast picture altogether. the once majestic throne of shivaji, which witnessed many a battles and arrays, lies in dust today. worse is the fate of the 17th century wall paintings such as the `sri krishna jambuvanti' whose crevices are carelessly filled with industrial cement. ``we preserve the artifacts with an insecticide, naphthalene balls and suntha (dry ginger),'' says mehendale. the monthly expenditure on the museum maintenance is not more than rs 5,000, including electricity and phone bills. till date, the museum has never had a brochure or booklet. besides this, there is no guide or gallery assistant in the museum. mehendale says, ``the gallery assistant's post has been vacant for more than two months. currently, there are only 10 employees in the museum. monthly expenditure on the staff payment is around rs 36,000, while the yearly collection of the entry fee is a meagre rs 35,000''.in march last year, the archaeology department proposed a rs 1.88 crore project to move the museum to a new place in hajeri mal, satara.the proposed museum building, on a four acre plot of land, would have a built-up area of 3,435.33 sq mt it would have 10 new galleries, a library, conference hall, separate gallery of forts and a huge landscape garden. ``however, nothing has gone beyond pen and paper,'' laments mehendale.according to mehendale, in august last year, district guardian minister ajit pawar had sent a reminder to finance minister jayant patil, requesting rs 76.40 lakh for the construction work of the first phase of the museum building project. but so far, there has been no reply from his office.

6,Haryana govt to set up Lok Adalats,"chandigarh: lok adalats will soon be set up in haryana government departments and public sector undertakings to decide such cases wherein no legal bar to their settlement by way of negotiations or consent exists. a decision to this effect was tak-en at a meeting presided over by executive chairman of the haryana legal services authority justice vk bali and attended by heads of various departments and corporations, here, on monday. state advocate general surya kant was also present at the meeting. while there was a consensus over the setting up of departmen-tal lok adalats, justice bali said that the modalities of these adalats would be worked out by member-secretary of the authority rs virk after examining the na-ture and number of pending cases in various departments. justice bali pointed out that de-partmental lok adalats would consist of a sitting or retired judicial officer and another member nominated by state legal services authority. besides, cases to be re-ferred to these adalats would have the consent of both the parties and each department would identify such cases which may be referred to the adalats for resolution of dis-putes. justice bali said it had been ob-served that 65 to 70 per cent of cas-es that had piled up in various courts were of such nature that these could be resolved through negotiations. although service rules had been framed meticulously, yet there had been lot of pension or gratuity-re-lated litigation, observed justice bali adding that the cases concern-ing transfers, promotions and ir-regular appointments could also be settled amicably in these lok adalats. he was confident that de-partmental lok adalats would prove a boon for litigants as these would help in quick redressal of their grievances. he, however, made it clear that cases related to seniority of service, where a compromise could not be reached, would not be taken up in departmental lok adalats and would be settled by the regular court of law. while assuring all help of the state legal services authority to departments in the smooth func-tioning of these lok adalats, jus-tice bali said the adalats would function under the act. justice bali said that a judge of the high court he had been ob-serving that administrative delays in passing appropriate orders at the relevant stage had led to large-scale litigation involving the government. a majority of these cases related to release of incre-ment or medical reimbursement of employees.

7,"Tinaikar report won't affect polls: Sena, BJP","mumbai: the shiv sena and the bharatiya janata party are not worried about the implications of the s.s. tinaikar committee report on the prospects of their candidates in the civic elections next month.the tinaikar committee was appointed by the congress-led democratic front government to probe the alleged financial irregularities and corruption in the sena-bjp-led brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) last august.sena-bjp leaders claim mr tinaikar has always been biased against the saffron alliance. however, tinaikar, in his report, has blamed all political parties in the bmc for the financial mismanagement.mumbai regional congress committee president murli deora said the findings of the tinaikar committee would be one of the issues that his party would raise to damn the saffron alliance in the bmc. ``we will use the report as a poll plank. the sena-bjp alliance has virtually bankrupted the corporation during the past five years,'' deora said. ``corruption during its reign, which has been exposed by the tinaikar report, reached dizzying heights.''sena-bjp leaders alleged that the government's move to appoint the tinaikar committee was ``politically motivated'' and an attempt to defame the saffron alliance with an eye on the civic elections.``the tinaikar report has become completely irrelevant for us. it will have no impact on our chances in the elections,'' said sena spokesperson subhash desai.according to him, when the democratic front government appointed this committee, the financial situation in the corporation had already improved to a large extent.``last year, the bmc curtailed its deficit from rs 645 crore to rs 245 crore. the government should have set up a probe in 1999 when the situation was really bad. by appointing this committee just a few months before the elections, the government has proved that its intentions were not noble,'' desai said.the sena spokesperson said that there was already divisions within the congress about whether to have an alliance with the nationalist congress party. ``for us, this report has no relevance whatsoever,'' he said.bjp city president vinod tawde said that the tinaikar committee report had boomeranged on the congress. ``the government tried to dissolve the bmc house on the basis of this report, but had to beat a hasty retreat after the high court reinstated the nagpur corporation, where the bjp is in a majority,'' he said.according to him, the congress tried to misuse the tinaikar committee report for political gains and claimed that the government's dubious intentions were clearly exposed. but tawde admitted that the probe had exposed the failure of the bmc's systems.meanwhile, minister for civil supplies naseem khan on monday criticised the samajwadi party for dividing secular votes with its unwillingness to join hands with the congress in the elections.``talks between the two parties on the number of seats to be shared were already on. but the samajwadi party leadership, on its own, announced a list of 49 candidates. it seems they are not interested in fighting communal forces,'' he told this newspaper. however, sp spokesperson majeed memon said his party had made a reasonable offer to the congress regarding the number of seats. but the congress was in no mood to concede the demand, he said.

8,DPC relocates critical equipment,"mumbai: the dabhol power company (dpc) has relocated some critical equipment from its power plant, which is lying idle at guhagar, to a more secure location. the equipment was earlier located at its 1,780-acre site near this megalopolis.the dpc has been continuously in the eye of a storm following the adverse publicity received by it on account of the high electricity charges.commenting on the relocating, a dpc official said, ``as an additional safety measure to prevent possible tampering or damage, certain plant components are being stored in a secure location, since vandalism and pilferage are common at the 2,184 mw plant site.''the dpc sent a missive to the industrial development bank of india (idbi) on thursday, the dpc managing director k wade cline said the company management had not destroyed any original documents or records. however, it had occasionally eliminated duplicates ``in order to minimise storage space.'' he said the company's counsel who was interceding for the dpc in international arbitration in london is in possession of the original documents and records. mr cline's letter was in response to a ``serious'' query from the idbi which in turn was based on an anonymous letter recevied by the financial institution alleging that a certain dpc employee had removed the critical `e-chips' and various code compact discs of the usd three billion power plant. ``the dpc communicated to the idbi that it is not a dead asset and phase-i of the project could be operated upon taking preparatory steps,'' the dpc spokesperson jimmy mogal said. it is common knowledge that due to lack of funds, the dpc reduced its staff, including security, to a mere skeleton of 80 personnel, he added.

9,"MIM is a business, not party: TDP","hyderabad: the telugu desam party (tdp) has described the majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen (mim) as a ""group of business establishments controlled by one family"" which uses its political clout for survival. addressing a gathering at gul--zar houz on tuesday, tourism minister t srinivas yadav said the mim had never been a political party in a true sense of the term. since its formation, it has only exploited the sentiments of the muslim community, he said. yadav said that though mim president sultan salahuddin owaisi has been representing old city for the last several decades, the region has seen no development. ""his sons asaduddin and akbaruddin too have been mlas from the old city for the last several years, but they have failed to even list out the problems being faced by the residents. they are more interested in their individual growth than the welfare of the common man,"" yadav said. the minister alleged that the mim managed to win elections in the old city primarily due to rigging."" this time we will make elaborate arrangements to prevent rigging in the old city.we will depute local women as polling agents in the voting booths to detect impersonation and other irregularities,"" he said.yadav also asked the voters to help the authorities in ensuring free and fair polls. the tdp's mayoral candidate teegala krishna reddy said the tdp government would construct a satellite township in the old city if voted to power. he said the tdpbjp combine has been receiving an overwhelming response from the people during the campaign and it would win the mayor's post besides winning a majority of the wards. tdp general secretary s m lal jan basha, former minister c krishna yadav, urdu academy chairman syed quadri, and others took part in 'padyatras' in ghansi bazar, mamajumla,chelapura, bandiatta, mitti-ka-sher, moti begum masjid and charkaman localities.

10,BJP forms seven-party alliance for UP polls,"lucknow: the bharatiya janata party has formed a seven-party alliance to contest the coming up elections, in which maneka gandhi's shakti dal is to be the latest entrant. the alliance also includes rashtriya lok dal of ajit singh, janata dal(u) of sharad yadav, lok janshakti of ram vilas paswan, loktantrik congress party and kmbp of chaudhry narendra singh. three parties — lcp, lok janshakti and kmbp — are sharing power with bjp in up while rld is supporting it from outside. state bjp president kalraj mishra told times news network on monday that his party had agreed to enter into an alliance with shakti dal. though the party has recently been launched, maneka has asked for 15 seats in khiri and pilibhit districts. the bjp-led alliance would be the biggest one in the state. samajwadi party has formed alliance with the samata, left parties and kisan morcha of v p singh. the nitty-gritty of ticket distribution is giving sleepless nights to the bjp brass. for the last four days, its senior leaders and rss functionaries had held meetings at chief minister rajnath singh's residence. in two of these meetings, kushabhau thakre, party in- charge of up affairs, too, took part. but no solution had been reached at so far. according to pyarelal khandelwal, national election in-charge of the bjp, the party would contest 325 seats. the state bjp chief, however, has another version. ''we may contest more seats. the number 325 is not the bottomline,'' said mishra. the rashtriya lok dal chief ajit singh had told times news network recently that his party wanted to contest not less than 40 seats in the state — these would mostly be in western up. the bjp, however, wants to give it just 32 seats — including the basti seat for national general secretary kailashnath singh yadav. ''nothing has been finalised. we are still having talks with ajit singh and maneka's proposal is being sympathetically scrutinised. the central leaders will have the final say in ticket distribution,'' said mishra, ''by january 16, the party will release its first list''.

11,Setback for farmers over toddy tapping,"thiruvananthapuram: the latest step in kerala farmers' agitation to tap coconut trees for fresh toddy — a candlelight vigil in kozhikode — was thwarted by the prevailing prohibitory orders. the cocunut farmers' demand to tap toddy for producing health drinks — as is done in karnataka, goa and maharashtra — follows a major slump in prices. the situation affects nearly 40 lakh farmers in the state. agitation is going on in neighbouring karnataka as well, where farmers demand the government's nod to sell fresh toddy. the successive kerala governments — be it the leftist or centrist congress — have been using toddy as a lever to control a section of the community and help contractors mint money. but with the elite leaderships of many states allowing tapping rights to farmers, kerala could not turn a blind eye to the situation any more, say the leaders. ''the rationale of farming is that the farmer has complete right over sale or use of his product,'' remarked farmer leader p j sebastian. ''but in case of coconut, farmers they are denied their fundamental right of tapping the sweet toddy on the arguement that toddy is an alcoholic brew,'' he said. fresh toddy, it is contended, contain low alcohol and only when it is left to ferment for long or chemical additives are used, the brew becomes a wild heady drink, a health hazard. but sweet, fresh toddy, if canned immediately after tapping with added flavour, make an excellent health drink. philip and other farmer leaders point out that the kerala agricultural university, thrissur, had recently lauched a toddy-based zero-alcoholic health beverage, called kerasudha. if a bottling plant was set up, the product would help generate tremendous income to farmers and revenue to government. it also has a great potential for export to the gulf countries. plus, in view of the government's avowal to make tourism a thrust area, an ethnic health drink would prove a boon, the leaders contend.

12,'Counter terrorism with non-violence',"varanasi: tibetan spiritual leader, the dalai lama said that though the emergence of terrorism was a matter of serious concern for the humanity, there should not be a violent approach towards it. it is a must to fight terrorism, but the manner of fighting it should be non-violent, he added. talking to mediapersons at the central institute of higher tibetan studies, sarnath on tuesday, the dalai lama said he was deeply hurt by the terrorist attacks on the us. i wrote a letter to president bush expressing my deep condolence, he said and added that he had also suggested to the us president to follow the path of non-violence in the battle against terrorism. describing the developing trend of terrorism as unfortunate and sad, he said that such problems could be tackled by taking both immediate and far reaching measures. under immediate measures, the governments might take appropriate action to combat terrorism, while far reaching measures could emphasise on developing non-violence in human beings for bringing a permanent solution to the problem of terrorism, he said, adding that the people should be convinced that violence is not an answer. he said that efforts should be made to develop a better understanding among different religions of the world for global peace. hoping for a peaceful settlement acceptable to both china and tibet on the issue of tibetan liberation, the dalai lama said the crisis could be resolved through adopting a middle path. he said such a path meant, ""we are ready to give up the demand of absolute freedom. we just want general autonomy,"" he said and added that under the status of autonomy, the right to determine foreign and defence policies of tibet would remain in the hands of china, while other matters would be addressed by tibetans themselves. is the status of autonomy to tibet acceptable to china? ""no, the chinese authorities do not approve this proposal as they think that such a status is freedom in disguise,"" he added. he further said that tibetan liberation movement was gaining support from various quarters of the world. even the educated lot in china were sympathetic towards the plight of the tibetans and their struggle for freedom, he said.

13,EC amends rules on naming substitute candidates,"mumbai: thanks to a streamlining exercise carried out by the election commission, political parties will no longer be able to field candidates at the last minute in case their first choice candidate gets rejected during the scrutiny of forms.the commission has effected a slight amendment in the nomination procedure for the february 10 civic polls. the names of substitute candidates who will step in if the approved candidates' nomination forms get rejected at the time of scrutiny will now have to be submitted along with the names of the candidates by january 10, the last date of submission of nominations. previously, political parties could submit names of substitutes till the last date of withdrawal of nominations.``earlier, if a candidate got rejected at the time of scrutiny, political parties had a second chance to come up with the substitute candidate. but now, if we fail to foresee a candidate's rejection and do not name a substitute we will end up with no candidature in that particular ward,'' said samajwadi party spokesperson majeed memon.the commission's move is aimed at streamlining the entire process of filing nominations. according to state election commission law officer r.n. pande, the decision has been taken at the national level. ``earlier, political parties carried out a number of changes till the final hour. this amendment will lessen the workload on the authorities,'' he said.``even the names of the substitutes will have to be authorised by the political party prior to the last date of submission of nominations,'' nationalist congress party (ncp) spokesperson gurunath kulkarni said. ``the moment the returning officer stops accepting nominations at 3 p.m. on january 10, political parties will not be able to change their candidates.''although most political parties claim that the amendment is not a great cause of worry, they do agree that independent candidates could stand to gain. ``if a party ends up without a candidate in any ward, it will most probably try and co-opt an independent candidate into its ranks,'' said shiv sena spokesperson subhash desai.``parties will now have to be very cautious about the particulars of their nominees. the slightest doubt could cost them a seat in the council,'' mr desai added.candidates having more than two children or a criminal record will not be permitted to contest the civic polls. ``the nomination of candidates can be rejected if they fail to meet these requirements,'' a bmc election officer stated.meanwhile, 118 nominations were filed in various wards across the city and suburbs on tuesday. a majority of them (79 nominations) were from independent candidates.

14,Bore racket report jolts BJP on eve of by-election,"rajkot: the ruling congress in the municipal corporation has blunted the high-profile bjp poll campaign by exposing the wankaner bore project scam. a report on financial irregularities put up in the standing committee on wednesday morning would come up for debate in the general board meeting on january 20. two bjp members in the committee, dhansukh bhanderi and mansukh patel, staged a walk-out terming the tabling of the report at this juncture as politically motivated. they said the report could not be tabled as the tenure of the investigating committee had expired and was constitutionally non-existent. bhanderi told tnn that the committee was formed on november 27, 2000 when the congress took over from the bjp. it had five members, including mayor ashok dangar, former deputy commissioner a c rathod, standing committee chairman bharat makwana and city engineer jivrajani. jivrajani has retired, rathod has been transferred to junagadh. the bjp leaders said the committee sought extension five times, the first one on february 3, 2001, the second in april, then again in july and september and the last one in november. the congress had not bothered to seek a further extension. legally the life of the committee ended on november 19, bhanderi said. the general board met twice _ once on october 6 and then on november 5 _ and on the both the occasions, the extension was not sought. so it was not entitled to submit any report. if at all the congress wanted to submit a report, a new committee had to be set up, he added. talking to tnn, congress party sources in the civic body said 'the exposure would surely take the winds out of the bjp's poll campaign as their leaders had indulged in large-scale financial irregularities in drilling the bore at the wankaner area to supply water to rajkot city during the past three years'. a special investigating team set up by the congress submitted its reports that money was paid to contractors for bores which were never drilled. the team measured the depth of some bores. out of 19, the depth was less in ten. some money was siphoned off in the name of dummy contractors. tenders were filled up in false names. the irregularities did have a bearing in the municipal corporation in which the bjp was routed and the congress won the civic elections after a gap of 25 years. political observers feel that the report could have a definite bearing on the rajkot-2 assembly by-election. the congress leaders had taken out their armour at the appropriate time to beat the bjp at the hustings, it is said.

15,JD(S) demands compensation to farmers,"raichur: the janata dal (secular) has urged the government to release a compensation of rs 25,000 per acre of land to farmers who have been hit hard by the out-of-season hailstorm that has threatened the very yield. a team of janata dal (secular) leaders led by former endowment minister muniyappa muddappa visited the affected villages and spoke to the farmers in distress. they said the farmers who had grown chillies had suffered huge losses and the compensation should be disbursed immediately. the leaders regretted that the district in-charge minister, raja amaresh nayak under whose constituency the affected villages come, had failed to come to the aid of the farmers. after visiting arashinagi in raichur taluk, the janata dal leaders said the crops that have been affected include chillies, cotton, gram, jowar and tur. they described the situation as ``grave''. stating that doling out a paltry compensation of rs 500 to the farmers will not help farmers in any way to recoup the losses, muniyappa muddappa recalled that during his stint as minister in the janata dal government he had released rs 2 crore within a day of villagers being affected by the hunasihalhuda project. ``the state government should emulate that example and act fast,'' he said. a team of janata dal (secular) leaders headed by party deodurga taluk unit president gadhar narasa reddy submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner and urged him to adequately compensate the farmers. they threatened to launch an agitation if action was not taken in 15 days. present at the press conference were janata dal (secular) leader shaik rizwan, former president of zilla panchayat ramachandra reddy, former chairman of taluk panchayat kadugol anjaneya, girija shankar, hardar bharamanna and nageshwar rao, who had accompanied the former minister on the whirlwind tour of the affected villages.

19,Ecology not at the cost of development: UN consultant,"hyderabad: the decision on economic development in the poorest countries is dictated by environmental concerns alone and these concerns mean nothing to the people unless poverty is removed, said independent consultant to the united nations m riaz hasan. hasan was delivering his lecture on 'environment and development in the third world' at the institution of engineers at khairatabad on wednesday. he said even though dams have been described as 'would-be environmental disasters' in most cases, the economic and social benefits outweigh any environmental damage. in india, dams have helped in saving the lives of millions of people by preventing floods and making arid soils fertile, thus removing hunger and poverty, he said. he said, poverty alleviation and sustainable development must be compatible, and sustainable development should not be thwarted by stringent environmental laws. ""only careful planning can ensure that sustainable development projects that are technically appropriate, economically viable, and socially acceptable are not environmentally degrading,"" said hasan. in india, the narmada dam is being opposed by environmentalists without realising the benefits of this project. he said the narmada project will displace 2,50,000 people, but will help irrigate one million hectares of land and provide food security to 90 million people in three states. ""environmental concerns should not be given undue preference over the sufferings of the poor and needy people of the world,"" he said. environment protection and training research institute (eptri) director general gayathri ramachandran, who presided over the lecture, said there is an urgent need to strike a balance between sustainable development and poverty alleviation.

23,BSNL officials unhappy over govt interference,"ahmedabad: union telecom minister pramod mahajan, while addressing a public gathering here on december 25 last year, had said, ""by vajpayeeji's next birthday, all the villages across the country - numbering 6,07,491 - will have telephone connectivity."" december 25 happened to be prime minister vajpayee's birthday. his dreams, however, seemed to have been shattered by private telephone operators, who while obtaining licences had promised that a certain percentage of telephone lines will be provided to villages. but at a meeting with the department of telecom (dot) officials in new delhi last week, the private telecom operators expressed their inability to keep their commitment to provide connectivity to nearly 60,000 villages. these private operators include bharti telenet (madhya pradesh), reliance (gujarat), tata teleservices (andhra pradesh), shyam telecom (rajasthan) and himachal futuristics company limited (punjab). and now with private operators shirking their responsibility and elections in many states round the corner, the government is pressurising bharat sanchar nigam limited (bsnl) to fulfil the commitments made by private operators. the issue has created a chord of discontent among the management cadre, who feel that even after making the telephone department a corporation, political interference is still on. ""one of the norms for granting licences to private operators was based on their commitment to provide village public telephones (vpts),"" said a senior bsnl official. as per the policy guidelines, the department targeted to cover 6,07,491 villages across the country by 2002. of these, bsnl has already provided connectivity to about 4.18 lakh villages. and of the remaining 2 lakh, bsnl had agreed to provide connectivity to 1.4 lakh villages, while the remaining 60,000 were to be provided by private operators _ compulsorily under licensing norms. according to sources, the highest quotation for vpt was one of the criteria for selecting a bidder for a particular zone. ""but once the bidders obtained their licences, they forgot their commitments,"" they said. and now with the private operators' inability to keep their commitments to provide connectivity to 60,000 villages, the government is pressurising bsnl to provide connectivity to these villages too. the minister is supposed to have already addressed the top brasses of all zones to be prepared for getting things done. ""but he never responded in affirmative when the issue of funds for the project was raised,"" said an official. bsnl staffers, who had earlier opposed the corporatisation of the telecom sector, are now getting agitated by the government's repeated interference into the corporation's affairs. the chord of discontent actually started when ""after sitting for over a month, mahajan asked bsnl to reinvite bids to procure cellular telecommunication equipment"". in fact the government, it is learnt, is also planning to create a special post of chairman by bifurcating the powers of the current chairman-cum-managing director.
