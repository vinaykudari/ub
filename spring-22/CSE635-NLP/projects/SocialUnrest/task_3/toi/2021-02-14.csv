0,Apply science for development of nation: Kanchi seer,"PUNE: Kanchi Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati has called for the application of scientific knowledge for the development of the nation. Inaugurating a hostel complex at the International Institute of Information Technology(I2IT) at Hinjewadi on Saturday, the Kanchi seer spoke of the growing importance of technology in day-to-day life.

""Scientific development is on the rise. Technology has become part of our lives,"" he said, adding that the central government had sanctioned a grant for the development of an IT city in Kanchipuram.

He also referred to the Chandra Shekarendara Saraswathi, a deemed university founded by him in Kanchipuram in 1994, where professional courses like engineering, MBA and MCA are taught side by side with the traditional vedic texts.

The philosophy of the university is to integrate modern and traditional learning.

The advisory chairperson, I2IT,Vijay Bhatkar,welcoming the Kanchi seer to the ""modern temple of learning"", said there was a need for the synthesis of science and spirituality. ""Science without religion is blind and religion without science lame,"" he said.

The Kanchi seer arrived in the city on Saturday as part of the Swarna Jayanti (golden jubilee) celebrations of his sanyasa dhiksa and peetarohana (ascension to the Kanchi Peetam). He is scheduled to leave for Bhopal on Sunday.

Education, health and adivasis, are among the 20 issues identified by the seer to be addressed during his travels to different parts of the country. The golden jubilee celebrations will conclude on March 31 in Kanchipuram.

1,(Cheaper) Power to farmers!,"PUNE: The state government has decided to lower the agricultural power tariff from 75 paise to 50 paise per unit. The state has one of the highest agricultural power tariffs in the country.

""The (state) cabinet cleared the proposal to bring down the power tariff for agriculture to 50 paise a few days ago. But a Government Resolution (GR) is still to be issued,"" Jayant Kawale, secretary, department of energy, Government of Maharashtra told TNN.

Speaking to the press on the sidelines of a seminar, ''Electricity Act 2003 & Power to Maharashtra'', here on Saturday, Kawale said the state would be compelled to increase the taxes on power if the transmission and distribution (T&D) losses did not come down by at least seven to eight per cent. At present, the T&D losses in the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) grid are around 38 per cent.

Incidentally, one per cent reduction in T&D losses would save the utility Rs 120 crore. Improving collection efficiencies of the utility has become an urgent matter with the changing power scenario in the state, according to Kawale. For, while the industrial and commercial tariffs are coming down, there is no scope to increase the tariff for agriculture.

The power tariff for agriculture in Maharashtra is already higher than that of other states. Even with the reduced tariff, it is more than double the 20 paise per unit that Tamil Nadu charges its farms. Similarly, the Rs 1,800 per horsepower (hp) the state charges farms that are not metered is four-and-a-half times the Rs 400 per hp it costs in Andhra Pradesh.

Things are not likely to improve in the future either. With the Electricity Act 2003 allowing open access, many high-tension consumers are likely to migrate away from the MSEB and the cross subsidy amount is likely to be reduced drastically. Open access will allow retail consumers to choose their electricity supplier, once the Act comes into effect this June. And industrial users will not have to seek permission to set up captive power plants.

This will increase the revenue gap. Tax revenues will come down as the tariffs go down and large industrial and commercial consumers move out of MSEB. At present, the state has no revenue gap, but this will not remain the case if the inefficiencies are not quickly removed from the system. Its revenues from the two taxes on power â€” electricity duty charged on consumption of power and sale of electricity tax â€” bring in Rs 1,200 crore, while its subsidy bill is only Rs 800 crore.

For the agriculture sector, currently the cross subsidy from high-paying industrial and commercial consumers is around Rs 700 crore, while the Government subsidy is Rs 800 crore. Industrial consumers will have to subsidise agricultural consumers for some time to come, said Kawale.

At the same time, the subsidy should be directed in a more focussed manner based on genuine requirements and efficiency, preferably by the agriculture department, he said.

2,Police to send teams to arrest Nalco chairman,"MUMBAI: The city police has decided to send teams to Delhi and Bhubaneshwar to arrest C Venkataramana, chairman and managing director of the National Aluminium Corporation (Nalco), who is wanted in a molestation case.

3,KGMU development works still in pipeline,"LUCKNOW: Although the state government has sanctioned around Rs 2.5 crore for â€˜expansionâ€™ of the new emergency complex of the King Georgeâ€™s Medical University, proposals worth Rs 35 crore for construction of a state-of-the-art trauma centre is still pending for the last two years.

In a letter sent to the state government, KGMU authorities have clarified that the new set up is only providing emergency services and not trauma services. Since the old emergency complex was in a miserable condition, KGMU authorities decided to shift it to the new emergency complex. Since December 24, 2004, the new emergency complex started functioning with only 50 beds, against the planned capacity of 300 beds. In the absence of posts for para-medical staff, the KGMU started the project with limited means.

However, now after the state government has sanctioned around 53 para-medical staff posts, the functioning of the emergency complex will be of some relief for the KGMU. Authorities are planning to start a neonatal and neurosurgery sections soon. At present, facilities of general surgery and orthopaedic surgery are available.

In 1996 the government had sanctioned Rs 17.2354 crore for the emergency centre. However, only Rs 50 lakh was sanctioned at that time. The work could only pick up pace after 1999 when the prime minister formally laid the foundation stone. Initially planned to be built in two years time, the project is only half complete even after four years. The government has only released Rs 7.46 crore for construction of the building and infrastructure from 1999 till 2003. Besides, Rs 1.20 crore has been given for purchase of instruments. The construction of a trauma centre along with the new emergency complex was included in the project in 2002.
