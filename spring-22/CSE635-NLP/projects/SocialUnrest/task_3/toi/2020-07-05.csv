1,CM kept me in the dark on agricultural policy: Guha,"KOLKATA : State agriculture minister Kamal Guha alleged on Saturday that CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had kept him in the dark while formulating his McKinsey-guided agricultural policy.

Guha further charged that the Left Front government was ignoring the plight of farmers and imposing a heavy burden of taxes upon them. â€œI am the agriculture minister of this state. Yet I knew nothing of the agriculture policy devised by McKinsey,â€� Guha said at a seminar organised by Samaj Vikas Sanstha in Kolkata on Saturday.

â€œIt seems the ministers are now more interested in shoes, fruits and flowers than the two crore jute farmers of our state. The spectre of McKinsey is haunting the state,â€� he remarked.

Sharply critical of the Left Front governmentâ€™s decision to impose tax and cess on farmers, Guha said, â€œThe taxes on farmers have become unbearable, but the government employees are being paid DA. This is the politics of vote.â€�

The agriculture minister also criticised the stateâ€™s recent decision to amend the panchayat Act. â€œThey are planning to create village de-velopment councils to advise the gram samsads on the course of development. This is bound to give rise to friction.â€�

â€œI have been urging all not to neglect the farmers for long. But the government, it seems, is turning a deaf ear,â€� an irritated Guha said. I am sure, they will listen to me if I bring 10,000 villagers in Kolkata and go on a destruction Kamal

2,Poultry farmers urged not to stock up maize,"HYDERABAD: Poultry farmers on Saturday were asked to desist from panic buying of maize as there was enough stock available with various government agencies and private traders.

The National Egg Co-ordination Committee (NECC), in a press release, asked poultry farmers to purchase maize required for the next 10-12 days, by which time the prices were expected to come down. The rise in the price of maize was due to the artificial shortage being created by some traders taking advantage of last yearâ€™s drought, it said.

The area under maize cultivation has gone up by 49 per cent during the rabi season and the NECC has procured 5,000 metric tonnes of maize for distribution among poultry farmers in Hyderabad, Namakkal and Pune. Preference would be given to small farmers in allotting the maize and the price would be Rs 50 lower than the current market price, NECC said.

Interested farmers were asked to contact NECC office at Hyderabad Business Centre, third floor, Hyderguda or on phone number 23241312, 23234067 or 23234068 or at NECC offices at Pune and Namakkal.

3,Baba asks govt to help out doctors with equipment,"BANGALORE: In a unique meet, a galaxy of eminent doctors gathered at Brindavan, the Whitefield ashram of Sri Sathya Sai Baba on Saturday, to celebrate the charitable healthcare of Sri Sathya Sai Hospitals, which have saved thousands of lives over the last three decades.

At a glittering function in their honour, Baba called on the government to support doctors wanting to serve the needy, with equipment. He also called on the healthcare industry to render free medical service to whatever extent possible.

Praising doctors as embodiments of the divine, he said, â€œThe best way to love God is to serveâ€�, and asked even those who are not in the medical profession to extend a helping hand. Baba spoke at length on health and said body consciousness needs to be checked and consciousness of the divinity within needs to be dwelt on for good health.

Baba recognised the yeomanâ€™s service rendered by two city doctors, Dr D.C. Sundaresh, orthopaedic surgeon and Dr Hemantha Murthy, ophthalmic surgeon, and presented them with cash awards of Rs 7 lakhs each. The awards were handed over by Karnataka governor T. Chaturvedi and chief minister S.M. Krishna.

Earlier, C. Sreenivas, chairman, Sri Sathya Sai Health and Education Trust, addressing the

huge gathering of doctors and devotees, apprised them of the role the hospitals have played in offering quality healthcare to the needy who cannot afford expensive treatment. â€œWhen love manifests as service, it is sacred. When sacred service becomes an institution, it becomes a temple of healing,â€� he said.

Sreenivas has been associated with Babaâ€™s various social welfare and free healthcare programmes for 33 years. His mother, Dr C. Rajeswari, spearheaded Babaâ€™s medical initiatives in the state way back in 1974 and helped established the General Hospital at Whitefield then. This hospital has since treated over 2.25 million cases from around 2,600 villages.

Sreenivas spoke of the Herculean efforts on at Babaâ€™s hospitals to bring hi-tech care and talent to the weaker sections and lauded the services of the leading doctors who visit hospitals regularly to treat patients free of charge.

â€œWe started off with just three doctors then and today there is a queue of doctors waiting to treat patients at this General Hospital,â€� he said. Sreenivas called on the medical fraternity to help bring much-needed relief to the needy. â€œIt is our obligation to help our brethren,â€� he said, and cited Baba saying that healthcare should be offered as a fundamental right to all, free of charge.

Dr A.N. Safaya, director of Babaâ€™s super speciality hospitals, said the total cost of treatment offered free would be worth over Rs 100 crore per year in commercial terms.

6,Govt must protest Pope's interference in India: RSS,"KANYAKUMARI: The national executive of the RSS in a resolution on Sunday morning urged the government to lodge a protest with the Pope John Paul II for his interference in Indian affairs.

In a strong resolution the RSS observed, ""That Bharat is a land of peace and tolerance should not be construed as licence to anyone to infringe on our national ethos and disturb peace.""

It urged the government to lodge a protest with the Pope for his uncalled for exhortation to Christian missionaries to carry on their campaign of conversions defying the law of the land.

""The ABKM would like to remind right thinking Christians not to submit themselves to the dictates of an extra-territorial authority and vilify their own countrymen,"" the resolution said.

Taking exception to the statement of the Pope that free exercise of the natural right to religious freedom was prohibited in India, while addressing Indian bishops during their visit to the Vatican recently, the resolution condemned it as a ""direct challenge to the sovereignty of Bharat"".

It pointed out that it was common knowledge that force, fraud or allurement were at the root of mass conversions so rampant in the country.

""Further, the experience of Bharat is that conversion is not just a change of the form of worship of prayer, but subversion of national loyalty,"" it said. Therefore, states like Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Arunachal Pradesh had promulgated laws prohibiting forced conversions long ago, it added.

The executive also urged the Hindu society ""to thwart the nefarious designs of conversion and also be vigilant to ensure that the concerned governmental authorities do not remain inactive in the face of such fraudulent activities and enforce the law in letter and spirit.""

In another resolution where threats to safety and security of Hindus was discussed, the executive condemned the killing of eight Hindu fishermen in coastal village of Marad in Kerala on May 2 last and demanded a CBI enquiry.

Alleging that even Muslim children and women had given shelter to the killers and the mosques hid them, the resolution noted: ""The coastal regions of Mallappuram have already been completely Islamised while Hindu population in coastal regions of Kozhikkode district has been reduced to less than 20 per cent.""

The resolution alleged that Islamic terrorism was not only finding a base in the South, but also in the North-East. In West Bengal, the executive alleged, the Marxists had ""joined hands with Muslim elements"" and were resorting to violence.

The opposition comprising Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) and Islamist alliance Muthahida Majlis Amal (MMA) have declined to accept the stand of the government and vowed to carry their agitation to block the Parliament.
