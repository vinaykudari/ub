1,CPI demands release of foodgrains for the poor,"hyderabad:the state council of the cpi has demanded that in the light of the serious famine and falling crops, the state government press the centre to release foodgrains and distribute them free to people who are suffering from starvation. it is a shame that the supreme court caustically chided these governments which claim to be responsible and people-oriented and told what they should have done long back, cpi state secretary suravaram sudhakar reddy said in a statement on thursday. he said that the far-reaching observations of the supreme court regarding the rampant starvation deaths in the country and the overflowing fci godowns with foodgrains should at least now stir the state and central governments from their deep slumber. ""while the godowns of the fci were overflowing with millions of tonnes of foodgrains, it never occurred to these 'responsible' governments that human lives are more precious than overflowing foodgrains in godowns and this is what the apex court has commented upon"", he said. reddy said that andhra pradesh in the last five years witnessed many starvation deaths and suicides due to hunger caused by various calamities ranging from crop failure to unemployment. but it never occurred to the state and central governments to open the locks of the fci godowns. statements of concern and shedding crocodile tears wasted precious time, he said, demanding that the government should not waste any more time in legal wrangling and come to the rescue of people.

3,Licence policy for air guns to be reviewed,"new delhi: the home ministry will review its policy of making licences mandatory for air guns which are being misused to kill birds or squirrels. the ministry informed its decision to the delhi high court on tuesday and said the bureau of police research and development will submit a list of the air guns which require the licence. the ministry also told the court that it will not issue new licences for the guns used for crop and cattle protection. the division bench of chief justice arijit passayat and justice d k jain were hearing the application of an ngo, people for animals, requesting the court to prohibit the misuse of these fire arms. in its application, the ngo claimed there were no guidelines to ensure that air guns were not misused. advocate raj panjawani told the court: ``air guns are available on pavements and children use them without any supervision. they not only injure other children but also kill birds and animals which are protected under the wildlife protection act and prevention to cruelty act.'' panjawani also complained that the government was issuing new licences for arms to protect crop and cattle without verifying the user's objective. he said these arms were being used to kill animals covered under the wildlife protection act. earlier, the ministry of home affairs had opposed the petition, while two other ministries - social justice and empowerment and environment and forest - had supported it. union ministry's counsel h s phoolka, however, informed the court that the three ministries had reached a conclusion to review the policy.

4,MPs rap govt on farm policy,"new delhi: parliament's standing committee on agriculture hasn't pulled its punches on the government's new agriculture policy, saying it falls short of setting a specific direction and has nothing on a blueprint for action. and, the mps are somewhat more cautious on genetically-engineered varieties, saying use of biotechnology to achieve food security may be a risky proposition. ``the new genetically-engineered varieties could be prone to unpredictable but serious, even devastating, pest and disease attacks,"" says the report. ``they are likely to reduce biodiversity, which is essential for long-term sustainability."" what is needed, then, is a credible regulatory system. the parliamentarians are very clear on what needs to be done. the report touches on a more efficient system to protect farmers after the recent opening up of markets, input pricing, credit flows, the need for some amount of centralised procurement so the excess of one state can be used to meet the deficiencies in another, schemes for green manuring to improve soil health, even the need to review the entire subsidy mechanism so as to know how much actually reaches the farmer. and, finds there's very little on aquaculture and fisheries. one refrain through the report is the need to draw in panchayats and gram sabhas, vesting them with the financial and administrative authority to implement the policy. the ``real issue,"" it says, is the question of raising farmer incomes ^ particularly small and marginal farmers who constitute four-fifths of the total. for this, it suggests a perspective plan for non-farm employment to landless/small farmers during the lean period. land, basic to agriculture, crops up one way or the other. reclamation of degraded and fallow land, and afforestation of unused wasteland, for one. here, the committee wants a 100 per cent centrally-funded scheme ^ with reafforestation thrown open to the corporate sector. two, a concrete policy on reforms, with caution on large-scale leasing by the private sector. three, a policy on vast agricultural tracts on the outskirts of towns, bought for real estate use but unused for decades ^ fertile land with irrigation facilities shouldn't be used for any other purpose, and misuse of land should be stopped, says the committee. then there's water, the most important input, which just hasn't found adequate emphasis in the policy. the policy hasn't got very much on funds and irrigation potential blocked in major projects lying incomplete, on how to tackle receding groundwater levels or even tackling a worsening problem of waterlogging in command areas. fragmented watershed programmes need to be reviewed and integrated, instead of waste, overlapping and inefficient implementation. this aspect of the policy needs redrafting, say the mps.

""we, the cable operators understand our moral responsibility towards the safety of residents,"" said a spokesman for the association. the members of the association met the mayor, harjinder kaur, and the chief engineer of the ut administration, puranjit singh to sort out the matter. meanwhile, on thursday people were left high and dry - and very frustrated - as, among other things, they missed the evenly poised india-sri lanka test match. many hearts broke as ""buzzing snow"" greeted everybody when tv sets were switched on. for 79-year-old ripudaman singh, there was no consolation over the loss of a day's viewing of the match live from kandy. ""i still can't believe that i couldn't watch the match which was at such an interesting juncture; even till the evening i haven't come to know the result of the day's match,"" says singh regretfully. ""for retired oldies like us living even a single day without television is no less than harassment. i have been cursing the cable guys since the morning,"" he adds. gurbaksh kaur, a grandmother of six felt that it was the wrong day for a tv strike. ""there are so many good regular serials on air today, how will i know the latest developments in star plus serials like shagun, kahani ghar ghar ki and kyunki saas bhi kabhie bahu thi,"" she says with a worried expression. as for the cable operators, citi cable's suresh says, ""it was a complete cable `blackout' observed by the over 200 operators in chandigarh and if they do not agree to the demands there will be more strikes in the future."" cable operators in mohali, however, were functioning as usual. sumit, a resident of phase ii, mohali was pleased that he could watch the match through the day. interestingly, he was harassed by a host of phone calls during the day from his friends in chandigarh who wanted the latest update on the match score. for vishal, a tata infotech student from the city, life without a cable seemed unreal. ""for us tv is a necessity of life, something which we simply can't do without. i have missed kbc today."" for children, too, no tv meant no fun! sakshi, aged 10, a student of jb modern school, sector 27, was visibly upset while telling us that she couldn't imagine life without cartoon network and the evening serials, especially kyunki saas bhi kabhie bahu thi. according to her grandmother, she watches tv for over four hours every day starting straight after school at 2.30 pm, which doesn't even give her time for playing with her friends. ""today i am playing with my friends after a long time because there is no tv,"" she declares albeit with a big sigh.

8,"No voting machines, ID cards for MC polls","chandigarh: elections to the municipal corporation of chandigarh - the 'wired' it-savvy city of north india - will be held by the traditional ballot box system even though the last lok sabha elections were conducted with electronic voting machines (evms). the election commissioner s malaichamy has reportedly asked the municipal corporation to arrange for nearly 1,500 ballot boxes that will decide the fate of the candidates. and it is estimated that this time the voters in chandigarh have increased by 200,000. not only the evms even other methods which were introduced by the former election commissioner tn seshan, like voters identity cards, will not be used for verifying the voters. and this despite the fact that lakhs were spent in making these cards. the secretary mc, ashwini kumar, who is also the assistant election commissioner, told the times news network that it would have made things a lot easier had the evms been used in the elections. one, it would have saved time as the processing of result would have been fast and a lot of money would have been saved in terms of the cost of paper and the other accessories, including the saving of man-hours that will be spent counting the votes. the election commissioner, however, had taken the decision regarding this and he was the final authority in the matter, he said. some councillors who wanted that the evms be used said that using ballot boxes was a retrograde step. councillor and deputy mayor mohinder singh said that it had been decided that the evms would be introduced at the local government election level and slowly be introduced at a national level but here it is the other way round. both the congress and bjp councillors expressed surprise as to why the evms were not being used in the elections. another thing that the councillors are apprehensive about is the incidence of bogus voting in the elections. des raj tandon, the leader of bjp in the corporation said that the election commission was also not addressing the fact that the demography of several wards has changed drastically. large populations living in slum colonies in various sectors of the city had been rehabilitated in dhanas, maloya, mauli jagran and other areas but they are still listed as voters in the old wards. tandon said that this could encourage bogus voting, as people who had been relocated might not turn out to vote. ""we will be employing the services of eight returning officers, 40 assistant returning officers, 60 section officers, five expenditure observers and zonal officers and 650 polling parties to make sure that the elections are conducted in a free and fair manner,"" he said.

9,'Trinamul must grow past politics of the street',"kolkata: the trinamul congress has to look beyond mere agitational politics and crying hoarse over the deteriorating law-and-order situation, felt some trinamul mlas. otherwise, it will be difficult for the party to move forward, they point out. reports of a section of disgruntled trinamul joining back the congress are doing the rounds. but sources close to mamata banerjee rule out such a possibility as long as the pradesh congress is controlled by the somen mitra group. a number of newly-elected mlas feel that if trinamul's current preoccupation with agitational politics continues, they will increasingly find themselves misfit in the organisation. people try to find political movements in mamata banerjee. that is why people flock to her, points out an mla. these mlas feel that it is time the party took a policy initiative to move forward. perhaps taking the cue, a number of party cells have been set up. while saugata roy has been entrusted with the working of the panchayats, partha chatterjee has taken over as chairman of the trinamul economic cell. chatterjee is trying to rope in intellectuals, businessmen and prominent citizens to shape the trinamul's policy document. my eventual plan is to hold a panchmarhi-type convention where policies could be discussed threadbare, said chatterjee. meanwhile, trinamul policy-making committee chairman pankaj banerjee reiterated his party's charge against the state government. the new government is approaching its 100 days. but during this time, 18 factories have shut down, not a single one reopened, managers have been killed by workers and a leading industrialist has been kidnapped, banerjee pointed out. the trinamul leader also unveiled his party's agitational programme spanning the next two weeks.

10,Brokers optimise derivative incentive scheme,"mumbai: brokers on the bombay stock exchange (bse) are making ``optimum'' use of an incentive scheme started by the bourse to boost volumes on its derivatives segment. bse, on august 6, implemented an incentive scheme whereby it waived transaction charges on turnover in the cash market on the condition that an equal amount be invested in the derivative segment on a particular day. but market sources point out that brokers are using this incentive to avoid paying turnover fees by taking positions in the futures market on a daily basis and subsequently squaring off their positions on the same day. ``here a broker writes call options on a daily basis and settles the deal the same itself in the options market. the same trade volumes will be done in cash segment as well where he does not have to pay transaction fees to the exchange. these circular trades cannot be termed as illegal but does not benefit the exchange as hike in volumes are quite notional. this is happening largely because these days brokers are doing proprietary trading more than retail or institutional trades since their participation is much less. this is to get an awareness of technicalities of options trading since it is a new area in indian bourses,'' said a broker. after the incentive scheme was announced the turnover has risen consistently from rs 9 crore on august 6 to rs 34 crore on august 14. the number of contracts traded has grown multi- fold from an average of 150 contracts per day in july to 1,500 contracts per day during the last six trading days up to august 15. currently, the exchange levies transaction charge of rs 2.7 for every rs one lakh of turnover in the cash segment. as on august 20, the open interest positions (number of contracts) done in bse stock options were 92,700 against total number of contracts of 28,000 whereas in national stock exchange the respective positions are 1,16,83,500 and 20,82,000. these uncut positions clearly indicate that actual futures positions are comparatively lesser than nse figures. turnover in the sensex futures contracts have shot up from an average rs 2 crore a day during july to rs 28 crore a day during the last six trading days up to august 15. however, nse is attracting derivative trading from institutional firms and even at the retail level. sources added that only few bse members__ around 25 per cent of the total 700__have obtained derivative memberships and therefore bourse volumes have been low. the volumes in the nse's options trading in stocks has been averaging at 650 to 1,000 contracts a day as compared with daily average of 30 to 55 contracts a day on the bse.

11,UWB board elections pass off peacefully,"satara: even as the voting for the new board of directors of the united western bank (uwb) passed off peacefully, prakash makharia of the makharia group denied he was attempting to destabilise the bank. the much-awaited annual general body meeting of the satara-based uwb was held on thursday evening. as per the directives of the company law board (clb), c.r. mehta, former member of the clb, presided over the general body meeting amid police bandobast at the radhika complex. the clb has ruled that the execution of the poll verdict be stayed until the final disposal of the petitions pending with its principal bench. while the clb has fixed september 11 as the date of hearing of the petitions, prakash makharia of the makharia group of investors told this newspaper that he was not intent on destabilising the bank. the directors would get an appropriate reply from the clb on september 11 when the petitions related to the bank would come up for hearing, he said. mr makharia said the board of directors had falsely stated that the bank had suffered losses due to the rs 60 crore loans extended to the makharia group. he said the bank was incurring losses due to its high rate of interest on deposits and lower rate of interest on loans. the bank is bound to face difficulties if this kind of financial business was allowed, he warned. the investors and depositors from western maharashtra have focused their attention on the developments at the satara-based bank, which is in the midst of a take-over drama. even as the bank's board of directors has urged chief minister vilasrao deshmukh to intervene into the matter and prevent the take-over, its executive director shrikant gadre has charged that the take-over attempt by sicom and the makharia group would adversely affect the interests of the investors.

13,Will the govt boot up Simputer?,"bangalore: it started out as a bit of a fashionable talk. indigenous technology, nurtured domestically but viable globally -- simputer. the central government is even thinking of protecting the trade mark, the it minister announced this in the rajya sabha on thursday. but ask the developers of the technology and they will say: only protection, no promotion. more than a year after the low-cost hand-held computing device which can operate in four different languages -- simputer -- made its debut, the project has hardly received any assistance from the government to expedite the access of the technology to those it is intended for. says founder scientist prof. swami manohar, ``maybe the government is playing safe. it's waiting for either the industry or other nations to place orders and assess its performance. in that case, simputer will take its own time which is deleterious for any new technology.'' echoing perhaps the sentiments of his foursome iisc team, prof. manohar said, ``in any other country it's most often the government which provides support to new technology, especially of mass consumption.'' to take the example of the mecca of new technology, usa, from cray super computer to the internet, it was the federal government which gave the required critical velocity to the projects to take off. cray was an offshoot of support provided by the department of defence, internet owes its genesis to defence advanced research projects funding (darpa) sustenance. with the it ministry's proposal to set up internet kiosks in various parts of the country, even if the ministries of it and human resource development decide to deploy simputer, the project will have gainful momentum. even the funding, sought by the simputer trust from the technology development board of the department of science and technology, has not come through. the poor man's computer is facing the chicken-egg dilemma. unless orders for bulk manufacturing come through, producers will not be interested; on the other hand, consumers will not place orders till the production model is in place. in terms of enquiry, the response has been phenomenal from countries like peru, brazil, middle-east, sri lanka, bangladesh. says vinay deshpande, ceo, encore software ltd, company which will provide software solutions: ""i am optimistic the government will rise to the occasion. till that happens, we will bring out the first commercially produced devices in november."" not divulging the name of the bangalore company which is manufacturing the devices for field-testing later this year, deshpande said at least two companies were going ahead with the production model. with a couple of recent debacles in the international patent/ trademark/ intellectual property arena, the government has been heedful (at least in principle) to the scientists suggesting protecting the trademark ""simputer"" in most countries. when the actual large-scale demand will catapult the project into the laity's gadget only the government can tell.

""as a result the awards are being doled out to totally undeserving persons, who can hardly be called to be anywhere near the petitioner (kumar) in performance,"" kumar in his writ petition said. stating that his name had not been considered for the past three years for the arjuna award, kumar said, ""i may be permanently left out of the award forever/or may have to wait for 40 years like milkha singh."" accusing the department of youth affairs and sports of failing in performing its public duty, the petitioner claimed the list of sportspersons drawn by it for consideration this year, had many names which did not figure even among the top 100 athletes in the country. ""prima facie it is apparent that the executive is not only indulging in mala fide (acts) but is playing fraud on the honest. the legislators seem to be contributing to the malice instead of helping to resolve the problem,"" the petition said.

18,'BJP wanted political mileage from Ayodhya',"new delhi: the rift in the sangh parivar appeared ever widening on friday, with vhp vice-president acharya giriraj kishore accusing the bjp of joining the ayodhya movement purely for political mileage. appearing before the liberhan commission inquiring into the babri masjid demolition, giriraj kishore completely distanced the vhp from the bjp saying there was no communication between the two. he said the bjp had participated in the movement for ""political advantage,"" and ""advani's rath yatra in 1990 gave him the dividends."" talking to reporters after the hearing, the vhp leader said the bjp had not joined the movement either at the instance of or to help the vhp. he pointed out that bjp leader sushma swaraj also had said the issue was a political one for her party. kishore, in fact, held that bjp joining the movement may have done more harm as others who wanted to support the movement did not do so because they believed it had become a bjp issue. saying that the congress too had tried to politicise the issue, he pointed out that ""rajiv gandhi had started his political campaign in 1990 from ayodhya."" he maintained that though the vhp welcomed all the support it got, it had never asked for help in the movement. asked if he still expected the same attitude from the bjp on the ayodhya issue, kishore said curtly: ""we expect nothing from them."" on future plans of the movement, he said ""just wait for march 12."" at the hearing, much of which was spent in academic discussions, the bjp was not the only one at the receiving end of giriraj kishore's erudite attacks. he negated the contributions of mahatma gandhi, saying he had no views of his own. he also said gandhi seemed to favour muslims, appeasing the minorities and had only advise for hindus. ""it is clear that as far as leadership for hindus was concerned, tilak and malaviya had it, but gandhi lacked it."" asked by reporters to comment on the resurfacing of the tehelka scandal, giriraj kishore said the website had done a disservice to the nation, demoralising the armed forces and rendering the government inactive for a while. ""what if there had been a foreign attack on india at this time?"" the issue, he said, was not just of what had happened but the nation's interest at large, which had been harmed by tehelka.

20,Measures to revive sick industrial units suggested to Bihar govt,"patna: the sick small industries protection association on thursday suggested several measures to the government for the revival of 3,040 sick\closed small scale industries (ssis) in the state. in a letter to state industrial development commissioner ashok kumar, president of the association r d sharma said that the sick\closed ssi units should be registered for their revival on the basis of their viability and in accordance with the rbi guidelines. the association suggested several measures to the government to provide adequate seed capital and seed money to ssi promoters for revival of their units, adequate financial assistance without any collateral security, necessary incentive relief, concessions for rehabilitation\modernisation\expansion and exemption from the annual minimum guarantee. it also asked the government to waive the maximum guarantee charges and called for deferment of energy consumption bills and their payment in easy instalments without any interest. the association said that the ssi units have primarily gone sick because of the apathy of banks and financial institutions which did not provide the need-based funds in time as envisaged in the industrial policy of the centre. the provision is also incorporated by the state government in its policies and the rbi guidelines cautions to arrest sickness of the units. the bihar state electricity board's uncalled for demands of minimum guarantee and maximum demand charges, especially in the event of its failure to supply regular and continuous power, has added to the miserable conditions of the ssi units, the association said. ""unless a conducive industrial culture is created, the banks and the financial institutions serve as active participants, continuous power is made available and the state government shows its determination to promote and protect the existing ssi units, any new unit, whatsoever, is bound to turn sick,"" it said. in this context, it is advisable to prefer rehabilitation of sick\closed units to opening of any new unit, considering the stake of huge capital and long period of time involved, the association added.

21,VHP's temple agenda set with eye on UP polls,"lucknow : contrary to the public posturing of the beleagured vajpayee and rajnath singh governments and the different offshoots of the sangh parivar, the connection between the renewed war cry for the construction of a ram temple at ayodhya and the coming elections in uttar pradesh has been established with the vishwa hindu parishad on friday finally unfolding the temple agenda. the first concrete move for temple construction will be made on march 12, 2002. nine days later, saints owing allegiance to the vhp would stage their ``ayodhya to new delhi march''. and the term of the up assembly expires on march 26. this means that the elections will have to be held at a time when the freshly-generated communal frenzy is likely to be at its peak in the state. local vhp leaders on friday emphasised their demand. ``we are not asking for a mecca or medina; all that we want is the birthplace of lord ram be handed over to us so that we can build a temple there,'' praveen bhai togadia, international general secretary of the vhp said. he reminded the media that the land which the vhp is seeking was under the possession of the union government and attacked the vajpayee government for its failure to protect the lives of hindus who had fallen prey to the jehadis in jammu and kashmir and elsewhere. togadia alleged, in an apparently algebric formulation, that madarssas, various muslim organisations and the isi were together equal to jehadi antakwad, adding that it had all resulted in the genocide of hindus. togadia, who was addressing a news conference at the vvip state guest house, also circulated a statement elaborating his thesis as well as details of the temple construction movement. togadia said, replying to questions, ``the country's citizens are no longer safe and the nation is moving towards anarchy. and whenever the state fails to protect its citizens, people resort to protecting themselves. they may even take to arms. we want the government to act before it is too late.'' while giving details of the temple construction programme, he said that 30 lakh volunteers were already being recruited under the banner of the bajrang dal. rallies would be staged in the next few months in 750 district headquarters across the country and activists would reach out to all the six lakh villages in an effort to create awareness. asked why his organisation preferred to lie dormant all these years under the bjp's rule at the centre and in the state, togadia said that the vhp was busy carving stone pillars for the temple project. ``you don't fix the marriage of your child on the day he is born,'' he said, adding that there had been a natural time-gap between the demolition of the mosque and the launch of construction work for the temple. on the face of it, he denied that his organisation had anything to do with the coming elections. whatever togadia and his followers in the vhp may have to say about the timing of the renewed temple movement, it will hardly be surprising if election-bound uttar pradesh witnesses communal frenzy yet again. the vhp has already set the agenda.
