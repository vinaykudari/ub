2,"Ground water dangerously low, minister warns","KOLKATA: West Bengal may soon turn into a desert unless urgent measures are taken to conserve ground water. This is no alarmist report filed by green activists, but an admission by state minor irrigation, water investigation and development minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya.

Presenting the departmental budget in the House, Bhattacharya warned, ""People think that water is an abundant resource, but it is increasingly becoming scarce and urgent action needs to be taken.""

Department studies show that 33 blocks across the state have become â€˜grey,â€™ which means further extraction of ground water is not advisable.

More dangerously, 61 more blocks have become â€˜darkâ€™, where water extraction has to be stopped completely.

Most of the ground water in the blocks contain iron far more than safe levels, while 60 blocks are affected by salinity.

Apart from this, 75 blocks spread over nine districts, have been affected by arsenic and three more are affected by fluorine.

The ground water situation has become alarming due to the reduction in retention capacity of the stateâ€™s water bodies.

""Due to heavy siltation in rivers, water channels, lakes, ponds and creeks, surface water storage capacity has been greatly reduced,"" Bhattacharya said.

Encroachment along river beds, embankments and riverside roads also cause obstruction.

""As a result, a large portion of the rainfall is not retained and runs off into the sea,"" the minister said.

To reverse the situation, new water bodies have to be created, apart from extensive planning to manage the existing resources.

Earlier, presenting his budget, state irrigation minister Amalendralal Roy refused to take responsibility for managing natural disasters.

""This responsibility lies solely with the Centre. The state government cannot muster sufficient resources to manage them,"" he said, referring to the devastating floods of 2000.

4,Vulgar display of power at school board polls,"PUNE: Those who take pride in the city being the seat of learning and the cultural capital of the state would have hanged their heads in shame had they witnessed the elections to the Pune Municipal Corporation school board on Monday.

The four-hour long school board election proceedings were marred by hectic political lobbying, horsetrading, submission of fake educational certificates and vulgar dances by the supporters of victorious candidates.

So blatant was the abuse of power that hundreds of supporters of the victorious candidates were in the PMC premises with â€˜dhol-tashasâ€™ (drums) and music bands since the start of the election process at 2 p.m.

As soon as the names of the winners were announced, the supporters burst fire-crackers and threw â€˜gulalâ€™ in the air.

This was followed by vulgar dances to the tunes of indecent songs played on blaring loudspeakers right in the premises of the PMC.

It was quite difficult to digest the fact that these ugly â€œcelebrationsâ€� were being held for the candidates who would be making policy decisions pertaining to municipal schools in which around 1.34-lakh students study.

And as usual, not a single political party fielded a prominent educationist for the 11-member board. Barring a few exceptions like Noor Mohammed Tambe of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), a majority of those elected to the board are political workers who were either denied tickets for contesting the civic polls or had lost these elections.

Among the five Congressmen elected to the board are former corporators Deepak Mankar and Sudhir Janjot.

The other three Congressmen are city unit chief of INTUC Manohar Akolkar, party workers Deepak Ramnai and Suresh Dharmavat.

The other six board members are: Mohan Wadekar and Nanasaheb Nalavade (Shiv Sena), Praveen Choarbole and Murlidhar Mohol (BJP), and Narayan Lonkar and Noor Mohammed Tambe.

Except Janjot, all others were elected unopposed after the warring political parties,which had left no stone unturned to engineer a split in each othersâ€™ camp, settled for a compromise formula.

Sources said the NCP had earlier agreed to join hands with the BJPShiv Sena combine.

The deal was finalised at a meeting held at a city hotel between NCP leaders Prakash Dhere and Vitthal Tupe and BJP MLA Vishwas Gangurde.

At the same time, Congress leaders, including MLA Chandrakant Chhajed and Ramesh Bagwe, were busy holding talks with the NCP party leader in the PMC, Rajlaxmi Bhosle.

5,Cong pulls out from PMC school polls,"PUNE: In a face-saving act, the ruling Congress party on Monday asked party worker Aslam Bagwan, who had allegedly submitted fake educational certificates, to withdraw his nomination for elections to the Pune municipal corporationâ€™s school board.

However, the party has not given any categorical assurance that it would initiate any action against Bagwan.

â€œBagwan has withdrawn from the fray and the issue has ended,â€� mayor Dipti Chaudhari, who was returning officer for the school board polls, said.

BJP corporators Vikas Mathkari and Ujwal Keskar, however, demanded that the mayor lodge a police case against Bagwan because he had cheated her by submitting fake documents, saying that he had passed standard seventh examination in 1978 from Sant Gora Kumbhar School, Pashan.

The school authorities had denied Bagwanâ€™s claims. Congress city unit chief Mohan Joshi said Bagwan still maintained that the certificate issued by him was true.

â€œWe will investigate the matter,â€� he said, but refused to elaborate.

Besides Bagwan, Congressman Shafa Khan was also asked to withdraw from the fray, inviting the wrath of scores of minority community workers who had gathered at the PMC on Friday.

Also, not a single woman was given the party ticket for contesting the school board polls.

â€œIt is true that aspirants from the minority community and among women may feel agitated. But we will soon compensate them,â€� said Joshi.

6,Rift among ministers benefits Laloo,"PATNA: Health Minister Shakuni Choudhary is getting impatient with his junior minister Akhilesh Singh.

A file relating to the transfer of about 1,400 government doctors has been pending in the office of the minister of state for the last 24 days.

â€œI have apprised (RJD chief) Lalooji of the situation. If the file does not come to me in the next 24 hours, as the cabinet minister I will create a fresh file,â€� Choudhary said while bitterly complaining that his junior minister has got into the habit of delaying files.

The mass transfer of doctors who have stayed at one place for more than 10 years, is being done at the behest of the Patna High Court, and this is to be notified in the first week of July. Choudhary said the file has been lying with his junior minister since May 31. The difference between Choudhary and Akhilesh has not been an isolated case in Bihar during the Laloo-Rabri regime.

Cabinet ministers and ministers of state are almost routinely at loggerheads. Excise minister Shivanand Tiwariâ€™s attempt to introduce the UP pattern of taxation in Bihar has been frustrated by his junior minister Surendra Yadav, who sent a parallel proposal to the cabinet sub-committee on economic affairs, opposing Tiwariâ€™s move. â€œI did not know that even a minister of state is entitled to move a proposal in the cabinet meeting,â€� remarked Tiwari sarcastically.

There appears to be no love lost between commercial taxes minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui and his maverick junior minister Dadan Yadav. Dadan recently complained against the cabinet minister and threatened to stop all files at his level. A notification issued by the chief secretaryâ€™s office last year specified that a minister of state is to keep a file in his office for a maximum period of three days. But quite a few ministers are accusing their junior ministers of flouting this rule.

The war of words between sports and youth affairs minister Ashok Singh and his junior minister Monajir Hussain is well known. Hussain charged his cabinet minister with not only depriving him of files but also of an office.

â€œThe situation suits the RJD chief fine. He keeps a tight rein on his ministers by ensuring that they get hostile ministers of state or departmental secretaries.

â€œMany of the files land up in the chief ministerâ€™s office due to the internal bickerings and differences in the departments,â€� conceded an RJD minister.

Additional commissioner of police, Madhu Shinde said, Mr Shaikh even threatened his officers when the raided the bar on Saturday night saying that he would get all the police officers transferred for their â€œillegal actionâ€™â€™ against his bar.

Mr Shaikh is now wanted in the case.

Assistant commissioner of police, Suhas Patil, who raided the bar along with sub-inspectors Lalita Gaikwad and staff said the bar did not have the mandatory police licence for stage performances.

â€œBut it had a stage floor on which girls aged between 16 and 24 years danced and were seen gesturing at the customers in a very vulgar manner.â€™â€™

The police have taken photographs of the goings-on.

Over 20 bars, many of them serving as dance bars and pick-up joints, have been raided in the western suburbs from Goregaon to Dahisar in the past one month.

On Monday, a group of bar owners and their employees led a morcha to the Dahisar police station protesting the action.

The protesters alleged that the police were raiding bars in order to get a higher â€˜haftaâ€™ from them.

The police denied the charges.

â€œIf we act, the bar owners allege that we want bribes, if we donâ€™t the public feels we have taken bribes,â€™â€™ a police officer said.

The bar owners demanded that the police withdraw the cases against Sasural Bar registered under the Indecent Representation of Womenâ€™s Act and the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act.

Police sources, however, said many of these did serve as pick-up joints and brothels.

Senior inspectors of several police stations said the staff at police headquarters should cancel the performance licences of bars whenever such a recommendation is made.

14,Power sops cost govt Rs 40 cr/month,"BANGALORE: The state government will have to pay Rs 40 crore to KPTC every month towards subsidy given to farmers who own IP sets, Power Minister Veerkumar Patil said on Tuesday.

The state government decided to collect Rs 540 per HP from farmers while the KERC had fixed Rs 720. The difference of Rs 180 per HP, which comes to Rs 40 crore per month, is being borne by the government. ``This is applicable only to IP sets which are not metered.''''

The issue was discussed in the cabinet and referred to the cabinet sub-committee which gave the recommendation. It will be ratified by the cabinet shortly.

According to Patil, the process of metering IP sets is going on in full swing and will be over within the stipulated three months time.

Asked if the decisions on loadshedding and fixing tariff would be uniform or left to individual companies on the basis of performance, Patil said an experiment is being carried out and there''s a lot of scope to learn from that. ``The four individual companies are just a month-old baby. Let''s see how it functions,'''' he added.

Expressing concern over the decrease in inflow to the Linganamakki reservoir, Patil said it''s 16 to 17 feet low as compared to last year''s level in the corresponding period. ``The monsoon is not encouraging especially at the coastal and catchment areas,'''' he added.

15,Panel pulls up development boards,"BANGALORE: Even before the High Power Committee for Redressal of Regional Imbalances submitted its report, it incurred the wrath of area development boards for its strong indictment against them and for recommending their abolition.

In a separate section, the committee examined the performance of the three existing boards __ Hyderabad Karnatak Area Development Board, Malnad Area Development Board and Bayaluseeme Area Development Board __ and concluded that they haven''t been performing according to the statutes of their establishment.

The three boards have functioned from six to 10 years now. In addition, the border areas development programme is also in existence since 1990-91. Altogether, about Rs 802 crore has been invested till 2001 in the three boards and the single programme, with HKDB hogging the lion''s share of 63.4 per cent.

``But the only aspect of balancing, if any, was found to be in terms of distribution of funds equally among constituencies. No concrete procedures of planning were applied by the boards. A proper database wasn''t created or maintained about effects and impact of the programmes. Even minimal procedures such as holding regular meetings, attendance of members, implementation of projects, were not followed,'''' he stated.

The committee has, instead, recommended an alternative body under the governor, on the same lines as done by the Maharashtra government for the Vidarbha area through an amendment. ``The governor can work through the state planning board for formulation and implementation of programmes,'''' he said.

Taking exception to a recent statement by HKDB members `condemning'' the committee for its recommendation to abolish the boards, Nanjundappa said: ``They must refrain from making such statements and using such language. The committee has been appointed by the government and we have submitted our recommendations. Whether it is accepted or rejected is up to the government, but they cannot condemn the committee.''''

16,Ex-minister Tota Singh’s aides in recruitment case held,"MOGA: The vigilance authorities finally managed to arrest another close associate of the Akali leader Tota Singh on Tuesday.

A close confidant of the Akali leader, Ram Singh of Medhok village under Mehna police station of Moga district was arrested from his house on Tuesday evening after two-day futile search of former ministerâ€™s house.

It is alleged that the son of Ram Singh was a main conduit in the recruitment of a number of youth of the area as teacher in the education department during Tota Singhâ€™s tenure of education minister.

The arrest of Ram Singh was followed after the vigilance department released Rakesh Bhalla, a local BJP leader and close associate of the former minister on Monday. He was arrested on June 21 here. The arrest and release of Bhalla reportedly proved to be a damp squib for the vigilance as police failed to extract any vital information from him.

The sources here believed that unwanted delay in arresting Tota Singh provided a lot of time to the Akali leader and his supporters to clear their houses and bank lockers of objectionable documents and perhaps, ill-gotten money. So, the sleuths returned emptyhanded after the residential premises of the leaders were raided.
