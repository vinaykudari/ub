0,Dharti Pujan was just another forced govt directive,"ahmedabad/bhuj: the special prayers held to appease mother earth on january 26, the first anniversary of the killer earthquake, in all government and non-government schools were reduced to a forced government directive. ahmedabad celebrated dharti mata pujan, as directed by the state government, in a textbook-like fashion in municipal-run schools. bowing to the state government's pressure, ahmedabad municipal corporation (amc) issued circulars asking its corporators, engineers, supervisors, public health workers, sanitary inspectors, peons and labourers to attend the 'puja' without fail. pre-identified schools falling in 43 wards of amc appeased the mother earth by chanting 'slokas' and hymns prepared in advance and by lighting candles and 'diyas'. at naranpura municipal school no 4, amc employees were seen working hard to hold the ceremony though there were few people around to attend. ""but two of the three corporators of the ward are ill so one of them would have to make it,"" said k d shah, assistant city engineer told tnn while hurrying up for the ceremony on saturday. in navrangpura ward, the ceremony was performed at gulbai tekra municipal school. candles were religiously lit by corporation employees in the courtyard under a tree with flowers strewn around and prayers were offered to dharti mata. there were 15 to 20 employees present along with municipal councillors of the area - manjulaben patadia and dr anil patel. ""the ceremony was not a forced one. instead, everybody felt it by heart and took part considering its importance,"" patel said, when asked whether the ceremony was forced on its employees. he added that earlier only the female folk used to perform it, but this time everybody joined the ceremony. ""this will become a tradition from now onwards,"" patadia said after attending the ceremony. private schools did not miss a beat either. like all the three branches of st kabir high school each of which lit 101 lamps around their schools and ensured that all the teachers attend the 'puja'. paldi ward skipped the 'puja' with nobody around to perform it in the municipal school no 28 premises. though the government was more than successful in implementing the dharti mata pujan ceremony, it was not able to get the crowd which reduced it to a yet another government function lacking people's participation. at the end of the day, only government officials were present at these ceremony sans students and the public. with republic day, memorial service for quake victims and dharti pujan falling on the same day, there was no respite for the 'babus' on saturday. ""there was no scope left to enjoy the national holiday as i was busy preparing for one programme or the other,"" said a sanitary health inspector with the municipal corporation. almost all the schools in the sabarmati and shahibaug area defied the directives by the state and hoisted flag without dharti pujan ceremony. ""we have unfurled the flags in our respective schools and now assembled here with students to celebrate the republic day with the general public,"" says renukaben shukla, the principal of sabarmati municipal school no. 7 & 8. children from both the schools had gathered at ramnagar chowk to celebrate r-day sans dharti pujan. at ranip, flags were hoisted in the morning at municipal school no. 1 & 2 but no dharti pujan was performed. in government-aided private schools, too, the dharti pujan ceremony was missing. the tricolour was fluttering at gayatri vidyalaya in ranip, but their was no telltale signs of a dharti pujan performed. the state government may have given detailed instructions on who will be punished if they do not perform dharti pujan on january 26. but schools in bhuj, however, have not received any such threat or don't seem to be bothered by it. in fact, bhuj deo naishad makwana said they did not make it compulsory for any school to perform dharti pujan. ""we had distributed 2,000 diyas for the prayers and hundreds of posters related with the puja but had not made it compulsory for the schools,"" makwana said. many of the schools in bhuj offered collective prayers at hamisar lake in the evening. ""we have not received any instructions about sending details of the puja to the salary division of the deo, gandhinagar, if pujas were not offered,"" he added. the swaminarayan high school was the venue for the most elaborate dharti puja in bhuj with chief minister narendra modi participating in it. hundreds of parents and residents joined by holding candles. among other schools which participated at hamisar lake in the evening was indirabai girls high school. the school operates from a temporary shelter created for it. principal m s acharya said that they did not find it necessary to perform such a ceremony in their school but would do it with alfred high school at the lake. interestingly, alfred high school conducted half of the puja ceremony at school premises and rest of it at the lake site. however, school authorities said that they made it compulsory for students to participate in the ceremony.

1,New law to curb child-trafficking,"hyderabad: to prevent sale of children under the guise of adoption and to streamline laws of adoption, the government is deliberating on a new legislation 'child adoption act'. speaking at the inauguration of a workshop on 'child adoption act' on sunday, women development and child welfare minister s saraswathi said a new law was required to prevent the sale of children which had become a business in some parts of the state. referring to the recent controversy over some voluntary organisations indulging in the sale of children, saraswathi said poverty and illiteracy were not the only reasons for the sale of children, but the role of voluntary organisations and middlemen playing on the superstitions of innocent parents could be the reason. the problem is more in the districts of ranga reddy, medak, nalgonda and mahabubnagar. the government had established an adoption cell to look into the antecedents of the voluntary organisations working in the field. awareness camps would be conducted to educate the people against superstitions, particularly in the lambada tandas, a community most affected by the adoption racket, she said. the minister appealed to the members of voluntary organisations, members of central adoption resource agency (cara) and legal experts to give their suggestions to formulate the child adoption act. delivering the key note address, revenue minister p ashoka gajapathi raju said community participation was a must for the successful implementation of any social legislation. citing the example of the anti-dowry law, he said it was being openly flouted by society due to lack of stringent punishment for violators. he said a comprehensive legislation covering atrocities, abuse and suicides of children needs to be formulated. pachayat raj minister p srinivas reddy said the poverty of families was being exploited by vested interests to indulge in child trafficking, particularly the girl child. the anagwadi system should be further strengthened to prevent sale of children. the government would extend the velugu project, designed to eradicate poverty to six more districts. law secretary sankar said the draft proposal, if enacted, would be applicable to all religions. women development, child welfare and disabled welfare secretary s chellappa, women development and child welfare department commissioner shalini mishra, central adoption resource agency member lakshmi kanth pandey, advocate g g naik and social activist geetha ramaswamy also participated in the presentations and group discussions.

2,CPM to protest power tariff hike,"hyderabad: the tariff proposals of the transmission corporation of andhra pradesh (ap transco) to the ap electricity regulatory commission (aperc) seeking permission to hike power charges up to rs 481 crore has led to a political row in the state, with the opposition parties crying foul over the government's move to submit the proposals after the completion of the municipal elections. while the main opposition congress and the cpi have alleged that the move was yet another blow to the public, the cpm took to the agitational path from sunday with the burning of an effigy of the state government to protest the proposed hike. it may be recalled that it was the cpm which had launched the previous agitation in association with the cpi and other left-wing parties and the congress had later joined. the agitation, which went on for over three months ended with the police firing on the agitators, resulting in three deaths. the cpm this time, however, wants to build up the public tempo before embarking upon direct action to protest tariff hike. as part of this, the party has decided to hold seminars and other programmes at state and district levels, wherein experts in the power sector will be invited to educate people on the various aspects. on the previous occasion the agitation was launched after the aperc announced its decision permitting ap transco to hike the power tariffs. but this time we have more than two months to utilise to build up mass agitation right from the grass-root level, cpm state secretary b v raghavulu said. in a chat with the times of india, raghavulu said the nine leftwing parties would work out the joint agitational programme before inviting other like-minded parties, including the congress, to join it.

3,BJP united to win the election: Modi,"rajkot: chief minister narendra modi is a perfect picture of confidence even though he is contesting elections for the first time in his political career. he has plans for rajkot that would appease the voters, who are tired of the vote bank politics of former legislator vajubhai vala. in a candid interview to this correspondent, he talked about present day politics, role of his predecessor and even the current trend of character assassination in politics. excerpts from the interview: tnn: what are your comments about union textiles minister kashiram rana vis-a-vis powerloom agitation? nm: i have no complaints against kashiram rana. he is our leader and would continue to do so. he is experienced in his field, but the party is united on the issue of powerloom traders' agitation. the powerloom agitators had entered into an agreement with the last government on the power tariff issue of gujarat electricity regulatory commission (gerc). while the state government stood by its commitment, the powerloom sector did not favour the verdict and called for an agitation. the agitators came to gandhinagar to meet me without even fixing an appointment. still i had deputed my second in command suresh mehta to discuss with them, but they were in a volatile mood. tnn: what about the infighting in the city unit of the bjp? nm: there is no infighting in the rajkot city unit of the bjp. in fact, the workers are fighting as a unit. it is one of the strongest units as far as party organisation is concerned. even the ward members are united on the issue of winning the elections. there is no question of any back-stabbing. tnn: what made you select rajkot-2 seat which was tainted by the role of vajubhai vala? nm: it has been said in indian culture that those in social life have to suffer if they do some work. even when they achieve something in life, complaints are made against them. but in the case of vajubhai, he was giving away something and still the congress were complaining against him. this was something unheard of in indian public life where a person was blamed even though he was giving up (read sacrificing) something. tnn: what would be the role of keshubhai patel in future bjp government? nm: keshubhai is a senior leader of the bjp and the party would always take advantage of his vast experience in governance. he is also helping in present day administration and politics. tnn: what message do you have for the voters of rajkot-2? nm: i am too small a person to give any message to the people. but now that i have come to contest and fight an election from rajkot-2, i must assure the people of rajkot that narendra modi was/is with you and will remain with you.

4,Development plan: The path not taken,"pune: most civic problems plaguing the city have stemmed from the trivialisation and non-implementation of its development plan (dp), sanctioned in 1987. although enough money was made available for the implementation of at least 70 per cent of the dp till 2002, civic representatives have managed to implement barely 18 per cent of it. as much as 30 per cent of municipal revenue has been spent on development, but all of it on non-plan activities. moreover, the civic body is yet to review the plan, although it is time to start work on the next one. social activists have consistently demanded a post facto evaluation of the plan implementation and a related white paper. the lack of playgrounds is a problem felt by city residents although the civic body has done well as far as creating gardens and parks is concerned. the draft plan prepared by the directorate of town planning in 1981 had proposed 177 playgrounds in the city, but the government deleted 62 playground reservations and left only 115. the civic body has not acquired even 10 per cent land required for making these 115 playgrounds, says environmentalist vijay paranjpye.the civic body has not revealed the actual figures on land acquisition either. the development plan has given detailed norms regarding acquisition of land for playgrounds. it suggested the acquisition of 600 sq.m. per 1,000 children attending nursery schools, 100 sq.m. per 1,000 small children and 265 sq.m. per 1,000 adults for playgrounds. the civic body's performance in road construction is dismal with an estimated 20 per cent of roads suggested in the dp being built.the plan had recommended the creation of cycle tracks and roads for pedestrians, which has been, willy-nilly ignored. the plan had also recommended the creation of a ring road to take care of inter-city traffic and avoid traffic congestion in the city. but barring the katraj-dehu road bypass, the remaining three bypasses for incoming heavy traffic from satara, solapur and nasik have not been constructed. the civic body also scrapped the project to widen the n.c. kelkar road into a 100-ft road. this move, however, drew little criticism, because it was turning out to be an expensive proposition, besides threatening several wadas. but the civic body could have, nevertheless, taken up the river bank dp road which has been left incomplete, paranjpye maintains. instead, crores have been spent on building the controversial river bed road, which has not been recommended in the plan. the district court has stayed completion of the road and prohibited its usage, thus blocking civic body's investment.

5,Anti-helmet protests an unscientific affair: Dr Naralika,"pune: lamenting the general lack of scientific temper among fellow citizens, noted physicist dr jayant naralikar on sunday said it was unfortunate that a progressive city like pune had resisted and rejected the helmet rule, despite the obvious benefits of wearing it. speaking at a function organised by the rashtriya samajik parishad which honoured him with the justice m.g. ranade award, dr naralikar said it was painful to see the protests against helmets.while taking a dig at the government for maintaining ambiguity in the issue, he said the citizens too should have checked scientific facts, before rejecting helmets. he urged the government to make helmets available in adequate numbers to implement the helmet rule. dr raghunath mashelkar, director general, council for scientific and industrial research (csir), who gave away the prize to dr naralikar, criticised governments for investing enough attention or money in education. recalling the ideals expressed by india's first education minister maulana abdul kalam azad, he said education should be linked to security of the country. education makes you more secure, he said. praising dr naralikar, he said the younger generation should read and experiment as recommended by the ace astrophysicist in his books. dr naralikar has the distinction of sticking to his principles, even if it meant taking a firm stand against popular sentiments, he said.

10,Haldia Petro modifying debt restructuring package,"kolkata: the management of the haldia petrochemicals is currently reworking on the corporate debt-restructuring package with minor changes which will be soon submitted to financial institutions. an hpl source said that with the change in management of the company, the corporate debt-restructuring package is being modified. however, the objective of the revised package will be to reduce the huge interest burden of the rs 5300-crore project. a fortnight ago, west bengal government decided to give management control to purnendu chatterjee of the chatterjee-soros group with 51 per cent stake. the tatas, which were holding 14 per cent stake, decided to exit from the project. however, how the balance 49 per cent will be shared is yet to be decided as the west bengal government holding 43 per cent stake is in favour of dilution of its stakeholding. according to sources, purnendu chatterjee is yet to provide the much-needed rs 107 crore to the company, but, they added, the money is on its way to hpl coffers. the hpl official said although the earnings before depreciation, interest and tax was positive and the plant was making operational profits for the last six months, the huge monthly interest burden of around rs 45 crore was really a drag on the company. the project, which started commercial production from august, 2001, had been primarily funded by debt to the extent of rs 4,000 crore as the company could not access the capital market due to depressed condition prevailing there. with the change in management, the financial institutions would now be in a position to address issues to the major stakeholder, purnendu chatterjee. asked if there were still commercial links with indian oil corporation, the source said that the oil company was still supplying naphtha to the project. the oil psu was being denied management control in hpl by the west bengal government, although it was being pursued to pick up equity in the petrochemicals project. however, any negotiation regarding future ioc participation in hpl would be carried out by chatterjee, who is believed to be keen in roping in a strategic partner.

12,Foreign investment hinges on Dabhol resolution: US,"new delhi: united states on monday cautioned that the dispute over enron-promoted dabhol power company, if not resolved soon, may result in india being deprived of big international investment. ""dabhol dispute feeds a chronic perception among the overseas investing community that india may not be ready for big time international investment,"" us ambassador to india r d blackwill said. the perception in the us is that sanctity of the dabhol contract may now be in doubt here, ""a concern that can spell death to potential investments"" in india, he added. ""long-term repercussions of the case can be profound and sooner the dabhol matter is put behind us, the better,"" blackwill said delivering the keynote address at a meeting organised by the american chamber of commerce in india and indo-american chamber of commerce. blackwill said us investment in india had less than halved from $737 million in 1997 to $336 million in 2000. us firms were investing only 38 per cent of what was approved by the indian government. most of the investments were not required to be approved by the government in the first place while it took a 3,456 man-days to get a final clearance for foreign investment. this equalled 10 years of effort from a single person and a 100 additional clearances were required for power projects. in spite of extraordinary advances in political, military and intelligence ties the country was lagging behind in economic relations, he said. ""i am seriously worried about our systemic economic relationship which is largely stagnant,"" he said adding bilateral trade levels particularly us exports to india were disappointing. india's exports to the united states have steadily expanded to $10.7 billion in 2000 from $5.7 billion in 1995. but us trade flows to india since 1995 have stagnated at around $3.7 billion during the same period and were as flat as a ""chappati"" at 30 per cent, india's average tariff was among the highest in the world, non-tariff barriers like onerous labeling requirements and laboratory testing stunted trade and in some cases, tariff rates on primary and intermediate products are the same or higher than the duties on the finished product. imports of 131 commodities had to comply with indian quality standards which was a less than productive government intervention. related stories:
