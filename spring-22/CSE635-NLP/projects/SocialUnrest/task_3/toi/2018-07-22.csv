""the internet is the fastest growing communication mode shrinking the world into a global village and everyone should be in a position to deal with cyber crimes,"" he said. justice banerjee said there was an urgent need to make laws to protect intellectual property rights as information was being transmitted through the internet secretly. chief justice of the high court, andhra pradesh, satya brata sinha, said that in spite of the advantages, people were reluctant to conduct business or transaction in the electronic form due to lack of appropriate legal framework. he said the two principal hurdles which stood in the way of facilitating electronic commerce and electronic governance were writing and fixing signature electronically for legal recognition. chief justice sinha said cyber laws were needed to facilitate internet contracts and laws, protect intellectual property rights and tackle cyber crimes. ap bar council chairman m rajender reddy, justice t n chowdary, justice i venkatram narayana were present.

5,Ajit Singh inducted with eye on UP polls,"new delhi: rashtriya lok dal leader ajit singh was on sunday sworn in as a union cabinet minister at a brief function at rashtrapati bhavan. his induction, less than 24 hours before parliament's monsoon session commences, signals the nda government's acceptance of two imperatives. one, that the government would have to hold the crucial uttar pradesh assembly elections in october this year, if the high court rules that the life of the assembly cannot be extended beyond five years. and two, the prime minister feels his cabinet expansion plans are being hemmed in by the conflicting claims of nda partners and others hoping to join the coalition, and a host of problems confronting him the naga ceasefire accord fiasco, the us-64 mess, the failed indo-pak summit and the once-again escalating violence in the kashmir valley. the oath-taking ceremony was attended by the vice-president, the prime minister and most members of the union cabinet, besides two chief ministers, rajnath singh (up) and parkash singh badal (punjab). later in the evening, an official announcement said ajit would be the union agriculture minister, one of the two portfolios being currently held by nitish kumar, the other being railways. the prime minister has also shifted three ministers of state. omar abdullah moves from commerce and industry to external affairs, digvijay singh from railways to commerce and industry and u v krishnamraju from external affairs to defence. the council of ministers now has 73 members, with 29 cabinet ministers. sources in the pmo said the decision to induct ajit singh was taken after the pm consulted senior colleagues. on friday, he discussed the issue with home minister advani and on saturday, he met haryana chief minister om prakash chautala who has been opposing singh's entry into the nda as well as the cabinet since they are rival jat leaders. apparently, chautala has nowreluctantly accepted the inevitable, but might still have some say on singh's portfolio, it is learnt. and finally, on sunday, the pm also spoke to punjab chief minister parkash singh badal. according to sources, though nda partners were divided on singh, what clinched the issue in his favour was the bjp state unit's recommendation that the electoral alliance with singh's rashtriya lok dal be sealed in western up. the timing was impelled by the impending high court ruling on whether up elections must be held within five years of the last assembly polls or within five years of the state ministry's swearing-in, which would give it time till next march. singh's induction took place sunday, as a cabinet expansion is normally not effected while parliament is in session. meanwhile, government sources said a major expansion/reshuffle may have to wait till the vajpayee government completes at least two years in power by this year-end. after assessing the performance of his ministers, the pm may then ``get rid of some of the deadwood'', bjp sources said. also, by then, the venkataswamy commission might submit its report which could facilitate george fernandes' return to the cabinet. fernandes, who was hoping for some swift face-saver, now has received a notice from the commission, under section 8-b(b) of the commission of enquiry act, to appear before it. as for the trinamul congress's return to the nda, bjp sources said it remains a problem. for one, ajit panja, who was virtually promised a ministerial berth, has not been expelled but merely suspended from the trinamul. and since the nda hopes to eventually see the return of the other eight tc mps, this does not seem to be the right moment. for tc leader mamata banerjee, it is too soon to return to the nda without a further loss of credibility. as for the pmk's return to the nda, it was cleared by dmk leader m karunanidhi, bjp sources said, when nda convener fernandes visited chennai recently. it has also not been easy to accommodate other hopefuls, the three mps who left the rashtriya janata dal, and the group of independents headed by pappu yadav, without annoying samata party mps or even bjp mps from bihar such as karia munda. and finally shiv sena chief bal thackeray has been demanding one more cabinet berth, the defence portfolio.

8,Kerala to shift to market-driven policy,"thiruvananthapuram: the congress-led udf in kerala that assumed the office two months ago is destined to effect a momentous shift from a welfare-oriented to a market-driven economic policy. international finance institutions, asian development bank (adb) and world bank, which have been approached for a massive aggregate loan of rs 5,000 crore wanted the kerala government to commit for a total recast of the fiscal policy. the overstaffed, over-pensioned and under-worked bureaucracy and loss-making public units will be a thing of the past if the adb and wb were to come to the state's aid. the updated aide memoire of the adb on the bail out package running into some $200 million has pointed out the areas of immediate governmental attention. the huge pension paid from the treasury was one major strain which the bank wanted the antony government to tackle. instead, a funded pension system, now being introduced by the centre, making build, operate and transfer (bot) system for setting up infrastructure, better tax collection, and down sizing the bureaucracy are some of the fiscal reforms suggested to qualify for the loan. the adb has, in particular, pointed out that the the system of retiring a government employee at the age of 55 with his life expectancy being 72 years (highest in india), kerala would bear very big liability on pension. instead, a fund would take care of it. implicit in this is a suggestion of transferring a part of salary to the fund. it is significant that the loans were negotiated by the erstwhile left front nayanar government. the ldf which is accused of spending like a generous uncle without looking in to the treasury had began worrying by the end of 1998. having exhausted all avenues of domestic adjustments, the ldf went in for the adb and wb loans. this is despite the cpm being an anti-capitalist party which blame these banks to be on the vanguard of enslaving poor countries. ""we have no way but to go for the loans,"" said a senior finance official. the first tranche of some rs 900 crore can steady the state and the remaining would take it on the road to a growth-oriented economy, he hoped. finance minister k. sankaranarayanan is hopeful of getting the first instalment of adb loan before the 2002 budget. but the reforms will have to be announced shortly to satisfy the loan conditions. in the melee of jostling for the massive loans, nobody however, is worried about the interest the future generation will have to pay, bewailed, k. vijayachandran, financial consultant and a cpm renegade. the small state of kerala already pays rs 200 crore per month on loans obtained.

13,Bihar govt to set up bomb disposal squads in 15 districts,"patna: keeping in view the stepped up activities of the extremist outfits and isi in different parts of the state, the bihar government has decided to set up bomb disposal squads in 15 districts. the squads would diffuse the bombs before they are used by the extremists. though there has been no instance of isi-engineered bombs blasts in bihar, the use of bombs and land mines by extremists is quite common. the bihar government is concerned about the blasts, masterminded by the isi, in other parts of the country and it does not want to take any chance in this regard. it is more alert after the arrest of hardcore isi men in sitamarhi and other districts bordering nepal. the state government had set up a bomb disposal squad under the special branch of the police headquarters after the series of bomb blasts in bombay and calcutta, but that proved inadequate to deal with the task of diffusing bombs in different districts of the state. subsequently, the government felt it tactically prudent that each district must have its own bomb disposal squad which could quickly react to the situation in the event of detection of bombs. the government has spared a sum of rs 43.3 lakh to open up 15 such squads at the range and zonal police headquarters level. the money, earmarked for the purpose, would be mainly spent on purchase of equipment such as blasting machine, electronics stethoscope, gas guns, chemical kit for detection of explosives, wire and cable locator, water cannon, prodder, mobile bomb, sealed rsp tool kit and zoom binoculars. but the very purpose of the state government to equip the police force with latest gadgets and tackle unforeseen situations, specially those of diffusing the live bombs, is being defeated as police personnel, specially in the constabulary and asi, si ranks are not inclined to join the bomb disposal squad. a senior police officer said that when police personnel were sent to undergo training of diffusing live bombs in different police training institutes in the country, including manesar (haryana), the trainees `deliberately fared poor in the test' so that they are not considered for inclusion in the squad. he said the police headquarters now has decided to take a tough stand so that the `erring' officers might not get away easily and posting of police personnel to the squad is ensured.
