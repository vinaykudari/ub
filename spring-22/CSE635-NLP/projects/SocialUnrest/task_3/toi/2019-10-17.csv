8,Naidu dismisses Thackeray remarks on BJP govt,"PUNE: BJP president Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday dismissed Bal Thackeray''s criticism of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and said that the BJP did not agree with Thackeray''s contention that the government was not dealing firmly with Pakistansponsored terrorism.

""We do not agree with Thackeray''s views,"" Naidu said when asked by reporters on the BJP''s response to Thackeray''s statements in Mumbai on Tuesday that the Vajpayee government was ineffective in its response to terrorism.

""Four thousand terrorists have been killed and 161 ISI modules destroyed over the last four years,"" Naidu said while asserting that the nation was happy with the way Vajpayee was dealing with Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.

Earlier, while addressing party workers, he said that it was just a matter of time before India delivers a fitting response to Pakistan. ""We will teach Pakistan such a lesson that it will never forget. India has not ruled out the option of attacking Pakistan. It is just a matter of doing it at the right time,"" Naidu said.

The party workers meeting in the city was hastily convened to coincide with Naidu''s private visit to the city. BJP MP Pradeep Rawat, city unit president Anil Shirole, state general secretary Bhai Girkar and party MLAs Vishwas Gangurde and Girish Bapat were among those present.

Naidu emphasised that the BJP was a strong national party and enjoyed the support of 23 constituents in the National Democratic Alliance. ""We are not worried if anyone threatens to leave the coalition. There are others waiting outside to join the coalition,"" he said.

The senior BJP leader stressed that the party''s focus on rural areas through the Gaon Chalo Abhiyan was receiving a good response.

""The prime minister has decided that more attention needs to be paid to rural areas and that the development of rural areas should no longer be neglected,"" he said.

9,Cong split on govt formation in J&K,"NEW DELHI: Even as the stalemate over the formation of the next Kashmir government continued on Wednesday, Congress leaders sought to make it clear that their party did not want to be perceived as power hungry and ready to split the PDP to cobble up a majority in the Assembly.

While some in Congress headquarters here do not rule out a short spell of governor''s rule if the PDP does not agree to join the coalition as the junior partner, those who have been part of the negotiations with Mufti Mohammed Saeed claim that a Congress-led government would be in place by Monday with the cooperation of the PDP.

It is clear that the Congress'' numbers do not add up to the magic figure of 44 in the 87-member House for even with the Panthers Party, the CPM and all the independents put together, the party would still need three more MLAs.

Yet, the Congress leadership here is not willing to openly discuss the issue of numbers and government formation.

Of course, getting three or four MLAs to defect from PDP would embarrass the Congress, particularly when the national and international focus is on the troubled state.

But Congress leaders say if a senior PDP leader walks over with a chunk of MLAs to be made the deputy chief minister, then the Congress could give an ideological cover to the move.

The Congress has denied any truck with the National Conference. It has also almost officially conceded that the deadlock is over the issue of the chief minister.

10,Joshi rules out FDI in education,"NEW DELHI: Is foreign direct investment (FDI) in school education allowed by the Vajpayee government? HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi on Wednesday ruled it out even as foreign schools have begun to come up in different parts of the country.

""We have not allowed FDI and will not allow it in future also,"" he said while addressing a media conference to highlight achievements in the HRD sector by the NDA government on completion of three years in office.

And even as opposition parties on Wednesday debated the alleged ""saffronisation"" of school curriculum, Joshi said the issue should be left ""to those who teach"" after the Supreme Court verdict on the issue. The government will not interfere with the framing of curriculum.

""The Supreme Court has already decided what we have done is right. The framing of curriculum is a matter between the NCERT and the writers of the textbooks"", he said. On the ""saffronisation"" controversy, Joshi charged the opposition with politicising the issue of school curriculum. ""We are constructive, they are destructive,"" he added.

Asked to comment on the NCERT book not carrying certain information about Mahatma Gandhi''s assassination, he evaded a direct answer saying he had not seen the books.

""The NCERT director had already said that if there is something wrong, it will be rectified. So it is a matter between who teaches and who writes"", he said.

As of now, foreign parties applying for opening schools can come either through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) or through automatic approval. Already, Canadian School of India is functioning in Bangalore.

The government is at present considering the extent to which FDI can be allowed in elementary school level education.

There was no need to ban the foreign universities since there are other ways. However, stern action would be taken against foreign organisations issuing fake certificates, the minister said.

Stating that the government would strive to achieve the twin goal of ""education for all and science in the service of the poor"", he described as historic the decision to make education a fundamental right of every child between 6 and 14 years.

""For the first time after independence the absolute number of illiterates has come down by 30 million and the female literacy in rural areas has gone up"", he said hoping that the trend showed that the country would be able to achieve an 85 per cent literacy rate in the next five years.

Joshi said a significant initiative of the government had been to launch the computer centres for minority community and 110 such centres had been set up during this period.

11,Water policy plan draws flak,"NEW DELHI: The water resources ministry may be hankering to evolve an action plan for what it describes as the ""effective implementation"" of the national water policy, 2002 which was adopted by the National Water Resources Council headed by Prime Minister Vajpayee in April.

But even as it tries to hold a dialogue with various organisations and stakeholders to formulate the action plan, several among the latter are demanding that the water policy itself should come under scrutiny.

One such dialogue is scheduled to begin in the Capital Thursday.

The ministry in its invite to participants has said, ""In order to evolve an Action Plan for the effective implementation of the policy, the ministry of water resources is initiating a policy action dialogue with grass-root level organisations working in the water resources sector on a continuing basis.""

Says Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People, ""The process of formulating the policy was not transparent. It should have been formulated in a transparent way after consulting people across the country.""

In fact, Thakkar notes that he had not even got a copy of the draft policy when he had sought one from the ministry.

The sudden turn came when the People''s Democratic Forum comprising six independent MLAs and two CPI-M legislators claimed the support of another six independents and sought ""outside"" support of the 28-member National Conference in forming the government.

15,Cong certain to win next Assembly polls: PCC chief,"HYDERABAD: Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president M Satyanarayana Rao on Thursday said nobody can stop the Congress from coming to power in the state in the next elections.

But the problem for the Congress is to rule the debt-ridden state, he said. Speaking at an open debate on the drought, organised by the Andhra Pradesh Youth Congress (APYC), here on Thursday, he said that the stateâ€™s economy was in a bad shape and the next chief minister would have to face hurdles to keep the economy in shape.

Highlighting the possibility of providing free power to farmers, APYC president T Venkata Rao alleged that Naidu had spent Rs 500 crore for his image-building exercise, but was not interested to offer free power to farmers, which would cost only Rs 300 crore. He said the APYC would picket in front of district collectorates on free power issue on Friday.

Power expert Narla Tata Rao observed that he was personally against the idea of providing free power to consumers. â€œBut, if the government fails to provide sufficient water to farmers it should supply free power to them.â€� Rao exhorted the government to minimise transmission and distribution loses.

But now the government has issued an order for evicting the hut-dwellers in the name of canal bund beautification, the MLA alleged.
