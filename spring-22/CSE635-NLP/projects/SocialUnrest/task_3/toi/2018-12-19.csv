1,Terror law will be a political weapon: CPM,"kolkata: the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) is not aimed at crushing terrorism as is being projected by the nda government, but is a political weapon to weed out opposition to the globalisation policies of the centre. citu national vice-president and cpm politburo member r umanath said in kolakta on monday. ""poto is already in force for the last seven weeks in the form of an ordinance. the centre still could not use it to prevent the attack on parliament. this proves that it is not meant to be used against terrorists at all,"" umanath said. the veteran trade union leader is in kolkata to address the seventh all-india conference of the indian bank employees' federation. ""ever since the september 11 attacks in the usa, the prime minister and home minister have been repeatedly saying that a terrorist attack is being planned on parliament. still they could not prevent it,"" he said. umanath exhorted bank employees to unite and struggle against poto. ""poto is against all forms of democratic mass movements and civil liberties. bank employees should be at the forefront of the movement against poto,"" he said. several judges have criticised the provisions of the ordinance. ""retired chief justice of india j.s. verma has said that there are enough provisions in the existing laws to deal with terrorism. his view has been supported by sitting several supreme court judges,"" he said. the comparison with similar laws in other countries is not justified, according to umanath. ""in the uk, the prevention of terrorism act provides for detention without trial for only 48 hours, which can be extended by five more days with the consent of the magistrate. but in poto, this extends to 90 days,"" he said. the condition of the banking sector was criticised by the delegates. ""the bank privatisation bill is awaiting enactment. while the common people of the country hold 70 to 75 per cent of the total banking deposits, the government wants to put this money into the hands of private business,"" state youth services minister mohammed salim said.

12,Plea filed against mode of seat reservation for civic polls,"mumbai: samajwadi party corporator tahir baig from andheri (west) has filed a writ petition in the bombay high court challenging the use of lottery system to reserve seats for the coming civic elections. the state government has been made a respondent in the petition. only 99 of the 227 seats are in the open category, while the rest are reserved for women, scheduled castes (sc), scheduled tribes (sts) and other backward castes (obc) candidates. the reservation of seats is enshrined in the 74th amendment of the constitution. mr baig's ward (no 107) was in the open category in the last polls, but it has now been renumbered as 108 and reserved for obc candidates. ``since the petitioner does not fall in any of the reserved categories, he will not be entitled to contest the elections from ward 108, which he had nursed for five years,'' said advocate m.p. vashi, who represents mr baig. the petition states that according to the law, seats are to be reserved by rotation and not by a lottery system. ``it is unconstitutional, illegal and undemocratic,'' it said. reservation of wards for sc\st candidates (17 seats) is done in those areas where people belonging to these catogeries are in substantial numbers. for the remaining 210 wards, chits were drawn on november 13 at patkar hall. `the place where the lottery bags were kept was on the stage while members of the public and representatives were made to sit at a distance in the hall. the chits mentioning the ward numbers were pre-written and not shown to the public, but were placed in plastic jars. there is no proof that all the ward numbers were included or whether some ward numbers were duplicated,'' it said. the petition claimed that only the municipal commissioner was on stage to draw the lots. ``in all other public draws like allotment of mhada houses, members of the public are called to pick up the chits,'' it said.the petition further pointed out that upmarket areas like malabar hill, juhu, jvpd scheme and versova are all reserved for obc candidates. ``the population of obcs in such wards is negligible, in some cases less than one per cent,'' it said. in mr baig's ward, which has now been reserved exclusively for obc candidates, there are hardly 300 to 400 obc voters of a total population of 44,000 voters in that ward.``the purpose of reserving wards should depend on the composition of the wards. if the wards are earmarked depending on the result of the lottery, it is bound to lead to absurdity,'' it said.

""congress would back government in its efforts to track down and bring to justice terrorists who are threatening nation's integrity today"", she said participating in the special discussion in the lok sabha on the terrorist attack on parliament. gandhi said at this critical juncture the need of the hour for the government and all political parties was to rise above partisan considerations.

""i hope the government will look into and share with the nation the reasons why the terrorists could make all preparations unhindered, actually enter the premises of parliament and literally knock at the doors of our parliament house, despite prior information"", she said.

24,Terror law may be used against attackers,"new delhi: although the attack on parliament house was carried out at a time when the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance is in use, the fir against the accused has been registered under various sections of the ipc. they have been booked for sedition, waging war, murder and attempt to murder. delhi police commissioner ajai raj sharma, however, said sections of poto would be added to these charges. if the alleged terrorists arrested in connection with the attack on parliament are tried under poto, lawyers say the investigating agency will have an upper hand during the trial. here's how: according to legal experts if the police adds the sections of poto in the fir itself, it can get an extension of 90 days to file its final report before the trial can start. which means that the police has 180 days in hand to file it. but the extension can be granted only after the police files a report indicating the progress of the investigation and states specific reason for the accused's detention. under the ipc, there is no provision to extend the period of filing a final report. if the police fails to file it within 90 days, the court has to grant bail immediately. if poto sections are not added to the fir, the police is bound to file the final report in 90 days. several sections of poto permit electronic evidence during the trial. telephonic interception can be used against the accused. the interception, however, has to be with the permission of the secretary to the government of india or the state government. under poto, electronic communication including exchange of e-mails on the net, transmissions of signs or encryptic messages in whole or part can also be read against the accused. ''in the red fort shootout case, the alleged terrorists used to communicate through pornographic sites. if such evidence is procured in case of the parliament house attack, it will be read against them,'' a lawyer said. under poto, confessions made before an assistant commissioner of police are also admissible. the ipc, however, is governed by the evidence act which does not allow a confessional statement to be read against the accused or a co-accused. under poto, anybody who funds a terrorist organisation or supports one can also be tried. poto is a combination of several laws like the explosive acts, arms act and also brings conspiracy within its ambit. an accused, therefore, if found guilty under poto, can be convicted and sentenced to a minimum of five years in jail. the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death penalty.

30,Blow to developmental works in Vadodara,"vadodara: developmental work in the city is likely to take a backseat with the vmc projecting a dip of rs 56 crore in its revised budget. the budget tabled on tuesday by municipal commissioner vilasini ramchandran projects that the income of corporation will be lower by rs 59 crore compared to the projections made in the 2001-2002 annual budget. if the situation does not improve, the revised budget projects a cash loss of rs 8 to 10 crore for the vmc. speculations regarding the bad financial health of the corporation came true with the presentation of the budget. the income of vmc received a major body blow with octroi collection dipping by rs 4.6 crore as compared to the april-november period this year. in the same period the overall income dipped by rs 17 crore. the note prepared on the budget points out that expenditure on development will be affected. ""the revised budget has been prepared after reducing or cancelling provisions for works which have not been started yet or those which are not necessary or those which cannot be taken up due to technical-administrative reasons. the administration has no other option in the present financial situation,"" the note states. the revised budget also points out that the present state of affairs arose as the corporation had not increased rates of taxes at the required rate. the budget clearly points out that in the last 10 years the taxes had not been increased sufficiently. also, it suggests loose control over expenditure was responsible for the state of affairs. while income resources remained the same, the corporation has added to the infrastructure of the city. ""however, there is a price for developing facilities and maintaining them. it this is not obtained by proper increase in tax rates, then these facilities obtained with difficulties and potential for development cannot be sustained,"" the note states adding that the financial situation would also keep on worsening. the fear of a zero development rate is also expressed in the revised budget. this is owing to the fact that the income of the corporation might be equal to that of the previous year. the expenditures will remain at the same level only after stringent controls. if the state of affairs does not improve, the draft budget for the next year will have to make arrangements for the same. officials in the municipal corporation said that new or increased taxes or curbing 'foldwari' expenditure on works by corporators could be some possible measures.
