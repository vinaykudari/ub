1,City comes to a halt to protest war,"KOLKATA: Anti-war rallies and special prayers were held in different parts of the city on Friday to condemn the US bombing of Iraq.

Effigies of US president George Bush were also burnt and calls given out to boycott American goods. At noon, traffic on the city''s main roads came to a halt heeding a call by state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to observe a â€˜chakka bandh'' for 30 minutes as a mark of protest.

Several roads and junctions, including Gariahat Road, AJC Bose Road, Park Street, Sarat Bose Road, S.N. Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani and Shyambazar five-point crossing, were choked.

â€œSubhasda told us that all of us should raise our voice against war.We believe America has violated all laws to attack Iraq,â€� said Bapi Mondol, an autorickshaw driver, standing next to his vehicle near the AJC Bose Road-Park Street crossing.

â€œI wish someone teaches this Bush fellow a lesson by bombing his house. Americans have never seen bombing. That is why they are so jingoistic. They too need to be taught a lesson,â€� said businessman Rabin Bagchi sitting inside his car, the anger evident in his voice.

Later, a Left Front convened rally threw traffic out of gear for well over two hours in the evening, causing hardship to office-goers returning home. Special prayers were also held in the city. â€œWe want to send a strong message to the United Nations and other countries against the US aggression. We also call for alienation of America by sane countries,â€� Shahi-Imam of Tipu Sultan Mosque, Moulana Noorul Rahman Barkati, told followers after a special prayer.

At the Nakhoda mosque, the largest in the city, a congregation of 2,000 prayed for the triumph of the Iraqi people. â€œWe prayed for the defeat of the US and its allies, who are continuing with war since the nuclear holocaust in Japan,â€� Pesh-Imam of Nakhuda mosque, Moulana Sk Mohammad Sabir said.

USIS stoning defended: â€œIf the US can bomb Iraq, there is no harm if anti-war activists throw bricks at the USIS building. Such demonstrations are going on everywhere across the world,â€� transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Friday.

The minister vehemently defended the incident of stonethrowing by Students'' Federation of India members on Thursday.

Twenty-two demonstrators were injured in the clash when the police took on demonstrators. Two policemen were also injured.

The minister also congratulated all those who had stopped their vehicles for half an hour at noon on Friday to protest the US aggression.

He did not think much of those who sweated it out and cursed inside public vehicles at busy intersections.

â€œSuch people will dirty their clothes in fright if two bombs are dropped near their homes. More such demonstrations will be held by mass organisations so long as the war continues. Those who do not want to protest against war are inhuman and similar to animals,â€� the minister fumed.

2,BIA hails amendment to rules,"PATNA: The state governmentâ€™s move giving teeth to the Purchase Preference Policy 2002, with certain amendments to finance rules has brought cheers among the industrialists of the state. There is some ray of hope for small scale industrial (SSI) units which are gasping for breath.

The Bihar Industries Association (BIA) president, K P S Keshri, hailed amendments in finance rules as this has â€œmade mandatory for the state government departments to give the opportunity of price preference in purchase of products of the state industriesâ€�. â€œA step to provide level playing field to the industries of Bihar has been madeâ€�, he added.

Preferential purchase is to be made after invitation of tenders for government purchases. For this the state industries have been exempted from paying earnest money. The policy will help sale of SSIâ€™s products at seven per cent higher rate than the products purchased from the industrialists outside the state. The medium and large industries have been given two per cent price preference.

Purchase Preference Policy first figured in the 1995 industrial policy of the state with price preference being fixed at 15 per cent, but it was not mandatory for the state government departments, which suffered from financial crunch to follow this while scrutinising tenders for purchases. So, this policy failed to deliver. The BIA, on the other hand, continued raising demand for making mandatory the price preference in tenders to industries in Bihar as they suffered from poor industrial infrastructure, higher power tariff and other factors giving rise to price of their products. The SSI entrepreneurs of the state could not compete with the entrepreneurs of other states, they pleaded. The BIA argued that the liberalisation had further made the competition cut throat for the SSIs.

Many SSI units had gone sick. Some of them have potential to bounce back and revive provided government departments gave price preference in tenders, said the president of Sick SSIs Protection Association, Ramdeo Singh Sharma. Introduction of two-envelope tender system, one for general tender and the other for technical tender (for assessing quality product), would bring transparency and help the department in giving price preference. If there is any discrepancy on part of the state government departments and public sector organisations, the SSIs can bring this to the notice of an Appellate Committee chaired by the secretary, industries.

The director, industries (technical), Mahesh Prasad, said that with this policy, the government is trying to extend market to state industries which need protection. â€œThis may lead to revival of some sick industries,â€� he added. An industrialist, Arvind Salampuria, who manufacture PVC pipes and accessories, expressed optimism about the governmentâ€™s move, but he complained: â€œNot a single purchase was made by some government departments including PHED in last two yearsâ€�. A BIA member, Arun Agrawal, said that the amended finance rules would help only when the government departments implement them honestly.

3,College principals told not to visit Chandigarh,"CHANDIGARH: The department of higher education in Haryana has directed the principals of government and private colleges not to visit Chandigarh without seeking prior permission from the concerned authority.

Stating this here on Friday, an official spokesman said that it had been noticed that some principals visited the secretariat in Chandigarh on the slightest pretext. This was not only an act of indiscipline but also involved wasteful expenditure, said the spokesman adding that if any principal had any problem relating to the college, which could not be resolved through correspondence or on telephone, then he could visit Chandigarh. But the principal concerned would have to get the prior permission for it.

He further stated that no principal should visit the directorate of higher education on official tour without the written permission, barring when he or she had been called by the education minister, education secretary or he or she had to attend some court case or inquiry.

4,Traders’ bandh successful,"PUNE: The bandh call given by the Federation of Trade Associations, Pune, (FTAP) on Thursday to protest against the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) in the state, evoked a good response.

Most wholesalers, cloth merchants, electronic goods shops, jewellers and grocers in the city downed shutters for the day.

A delegation of traders met district collector Madhukar Kokate in the morning to submit a memorandum, opposing immediate implementation of VAT. Mohan Oswal, president, Poona Merchants Chamber told TNN on Thursday that there was great confusion among traders over VAT as the precise rules had not been made available. â€œOfficers are still being trained and we fear there will be harassment due to differences in interpretation,â€� he explained.

Oswal said tradersâ€™ representatives will meet in the city in the next couple of days to chalk out a line of action to oppose implementation of VAT.

Among the tradersâ€™ demands is the abolition of all other taxes before VAT is enforced, the chamber president said. They have also called for the simultaneous implementation of VAT all over the country, while calling for the exclusion of all essential commodities from its purview. The traders have also objected to certain provisions which they felt would lead to harassment.

7,"'Iraq attack not a clash between Christiandom, Islamidom'","NEW DELHI: Asserting that the recent attack on Iraq should not be seen as a clash between ""Christiandom"" and ""Islamidom"", an eminent historian has said the latest US strikes were simply a part of its hegemony aimed at redrawing the boundaries of West Asia.

""West is neither an unified entity nor is inimical to Islam. The recent protest against the US attack show that certain problems cut across religious boundaries,"" Professor Mushirul Hasan said while speaking on ''The Crescent in Crisis - After September 11'' at the M N Roy Memorial lecture here on Friday.

Hasan pointed out that even the attack on the World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001 was not an assault on Christianism but an outrage of mounting political disillusion among the people in some countries.

This disillusionment which has targeted US today may fall on the feudal Gulf countries in the future, Hasan claimed and stressed that it was wrong to draw Islam in the debate, as terrorism has no sanction of religion and has no nationality.

Taking a dig at the concept of pan-Islamic terrorism propagated by some powers after the 9/11 attack, he said, ""how can we generalise it... Today the call of jehad has few takers and even after the attack on Iraq millions of Muslims are not ready to start a jehad against all and sundry.""

Hasan said that stronger nations need to understand the problems of the people and added that ""we will do well to regard follower of Islam not on religion but on other issues.""

Hasan was critical about the support of nations like Turkey and Saudi Arabia to the US ""motive"" and said the crescent can only be saved if the voices of restraint and moderation heard from across the world take the centrestage.

Advocating a proactive role by the secular Muslim institutions, he said not the survival of Islam but the progress and prosperity of the Muslim Society is at stake and this problem has to be addressed as a priority.

""No longer can West be a scapegoat for all the problem in some Muslim states,"" he said, adding, the enemy lies within the boundaries of these nation states amongst those who enforce Islam against the letter and spirit of Quran.

Survival of the world depends on peace and cooperation among various communities and one can only hope that this war ends at the earliest, he said.

Lamenting that no country could stop the US from attacking a small country, veteran journalist Ajit Bhattacharjea said, ""a new global force has started to emerge to counter the Bush doctrine.""

This force of global opinion replicated in the form of protest all over the world has come forward as an unexpected resistance to the US offensive, which is a positive development for the future, he said.

8,India did act on Gujarat violence: Rocca,"WASHINGTON: The Indian government has taken ""much action"" against those behind the Gujarat violence but it was not reflected due to the ""agonisingly slow"" legal system in the country, US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Christina Rocca has said.

""There have been a number of arrests and prosecutions,"" she said on Friday responding to questions on the Gujarat violence during her testimony before the a subcommittee on Asia and Pacific.

""The legal system in India is agonisingly slow and that gives the impression that nothing is happening. But the fact of the matter is that they did take action and they are continuing to take action,"" she said.

""This was a stain on their secular record. And no one is more concerned about it, I believe, than the Indians themselves,"" she added.

The United States, Rocca said, has spoken out loudly and often on the terrible events of Gujarat, and it did not in any way get a pass from anywhere in the world, much less from the Bush administration.

But it also was a cause of great concern to the Indian government as well and they have expressed great concern and sadness and were focused on it very much internally, especially the Prime Minister, that this kind of activity and this kind of event never be repeated, she said.

She described India as ""a democracy where a discussion of all these concerns takes place,"" she said, the government is putting together policies to make sure it does not happen again.""

9,Pak to enforce Shariah law in NWFP,"ISLAMABAD: The hardline Islamist alliance government in Pakistan''s volatile North West Frontier Province has decided to bring Shariah law in the state.

The NWFP Chief Minister Akram Khan Durrani, heading the the six-party fundamentalist Muthahida Majlis Amal government, said he has approved the recommendations of Nifaze-e-Shariat Council, to bring a new Shariah Act to implement Islamic laws in the province.

In a statement issued on Friday, Durrani said he wanted the Shariat bill to be approved by the NWFP Assembly to establish an accountability institution, appoint Muhtasib at provincial and district levels to take suo motu action besides ensuring cheap justice.

The MMA is also a partner in the coalition government in neighbouring Baluchistan.

After taking over power in the province bordering Afghanistan, Durrani government has already banned music, films and liquor.

He said the formation of reconciliation committees comprising Ulema, elites and lawyers would help in improving law and order situation and reduce the burden on judiciary.

The chief minister announced complete ban on obscene photos and cassettes. He said possession of such material would be considered a cognisable offence.

After the passage of Shariat bill, it would be the supreme law in all institutions coming under its jurisdiction, Durran said adding all directives would be based on the injunctions of Islamic laws.

Not a single law in the provincial institutions would be un-Islamic, he said.

10,Vajpayee advices US to stop violence,"NEW DELHI: Amidst raging war in Iraq, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday sent out an advice in a veiled manner to the US -- to stop violence.

Vajpayee, who was speaking at a function to mark the culmination of a Shooting tournament here, apparently could not resist reference to the Iraq developments, albeit in an indicative fashion.

""When one hears about shooting, it is generally associated with either entertainment and films, or violence,"" he said and added, ""As far as shooting of films and in sports is concerned, it is fine. But let there be no more shooting of missiles and gunshots on this beautiful world.""

Defence Minister George Fernandes later told reporters that the Government was ""committed"" to provide humanitarian aid to Iraq but a decision in this regard would be taken when the ""situation stabilises"" in the Gulf.

On evacuation of Indian community from the Gulf region, he said all those willing to return had done so.

""But our aircraft, both military and civil, are ready to bring back at short notice others also who want to come here,"" Fernandes said.

11,US eyeing political control over Iraq,"WASHINGTON: The United States intends to retain firm political control over Iraq until it is satisfied that it can turn over the government to Iraqis from within Iraq, and from among exiles, it can trust to rule the country democratically and retain its territorial integrity, according to the media here.

It is not easy to put together a government of Kurds, Sunnis and the Shia majority in the country which has been denied political power until now, with very little interaction among each other.

The Washington Times said, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher made it clear on Friday the UN role in the post-war period will be confined to humanitarian activities.

The pattern the US appears to be choosing is Japan after World War II, when General MacArthur became supreme ruler until the Japanese were ready to become genuine democrats instead of being ruled by a junta under the emperor with some dramatic trappings.

The US hopes to make Iraq a model democracy which will become a model for the rest of the Arab world. At present the only democracy in that region is Israel.

The Washington Times reports that US Army Lt Gen John Abizaid, one of two deputy commanders of the US Central Command, which is running the Iraq war, will likely be the top military officer in postwar Iraq.

The Arabic-speaking West Point graduate, it said, would essentially run the country while the US maintained order and then slowly handed power to Iraqi citizens.

12,KMC blames budget deficit on state govt,"KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation spent Rs 60 crore less than it had proposed in its 2002-03 budget. Yet, it has once again proposed an expenditure sheet that is Rs 30 crore in excess of what it proposes to earn in 2003-04.

Estimates and actuals in the budget documents also reveal a hike in earnings as tax and non-tax revenues eclipsed estimations by Rs 19 crore. Revised estimates indicated that tax revenue was up by Rs 19.20 crore while non tax revenue increased by a whopping Rs 170.48 crore.

Though KMC top brass pointed to the shortfall in government grants to the tune of nearly Rs 110 crore for the Rs 59 crore deficit in 2002-03, they are unable to account for the dismal picture on the expenditure front on some crucial heads.

In education, the civic body spent only Rs 3.07 crore against a budgetary provision of Rs 17.24 crore. Similarly, the bustee department spent only 8.97 crore out of Rs 18 crore. While several streets continued to be ill-lit, the KMC lighting department could not spend Rs 3 crore during the fiscal.

The situation isnâ€™t any different for the roads department where Rs 54.27 crore was spent against an allocation of Rs 59.87 crore. In the water supply department, the expenditure was Rs 68.53 crore though it had Rs 81.02 crore at its disposal.

Funds under chief engineer (civil) and chief engineer (planning and development) lay unutilised during 2002-03. The two spent only a fourth of the Rs 1.15 crore allocated to them.

Curiously enough, the KMC was liberal in opening its pursestrings when it comes to certain obscure heads.

13,Consensus eludes all-party meeting on Iraq,"NEW DELHI: Consensus eluded the all-party meeting on Iraq for the second time in a fortnight, with the Vajpayee government refusing on Saturday to sign on to a resolution ''condemning'' the US-led forces'' ongoing aggression against Iraq.

Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, admitting a common resolution had not been possible since there was no agreement on the choice of words, said, ""We pleaded (with the opposition) that the government''s statements (on Iraq), past and present, had taken the developing situation into account. Any future statement, therefore, should be left to the government and not imposed on it.""

At the all-party meeting on March 10, the government had rejected the idea of a joint parliamentary resolution, saying it didn''t wish to be tied down by it as it was still a ""developing situation"".

But Saturday''s meeting indicated that even though war had since broken out in Iraq -- a war which the government says it is ""not endorsing"" -- the Vajpayee government is still soft-pedalling the issue, fighting shy of naming the US in its statements.

Denying this, Sinha said, ""There is no hesitation on our part in naming the US -- it''s no secret who we are speaking of.""

This cautious, oblique approach was evident in the PM''s opening statement to the all-party meeting, where he equated Iraq with the US, and Security Council members opposed to the war with the US: ""Whatever the rights and wrongs of the Iraq situation,"" the PM said, ""our relationship with others cannot be defined by a single issue, however important, and whatever the differences in points of view.""

Justifying the government''s approach, the PM stressed, ""Our words, actions and diplomatic efforts should be aimed at trying to achieve pragmatic goals, rather than creating rhetorical effect. Quiet diplomacy is far more effective than public posturing.""

This line clearly did not go down well with the opposition. Barring the AIADMK, the entire opposition -- including the Congress -- supported a resolution ""condemning"" the US.

The CPM''s Somnath Chatterjee said: ""We wanted a common resolution condemning the US action, asking for withdrawal of troops and underlining that any future action must have UN sanction.""

The RJD''s Laloo Prasad Yadav, in his characteristic blunt fashion, said, ""The message we are sending out is that this a cowardly government. If India today cannot forcefully condemn an act of such naked aggression, tomorrow if we are in trouble who will stand up for us? A middle path is not the answer.""

Even the BJP''s allies such as the TDP wanted a resolution condemning the US.

Earlier, the PM told the meeting that he had conveyed to US President George Bush -- telephonically on Thursday -- India''s ""concerns about the military action"" and the ""widespread unease at the implications of regime change.""

Referring to the recent NAM summit in Kula Lumpur, the PM also told Bush that several leaders there had expressed ""their anxiety that military action for regime change in Iraq could set a dangerous example. They are concerned that this precedent could be used also to change their regimes. America should reassure the world that that such fears are unfounded.""

14,Punjab govt delaying apparel park project: Rana,"LUDHIANA: Union textile minister Kashiram Rana on Saturday blamed the Punjab government for not honouring its obligation of providing land for Apparel Park at Ludhiana as per the scheme thus causing inordinate delay in the project.

Talking to newspersons after delivering keynote address at a seminar organised by wool and woollen export promotion council (WWEPC), Rana disclosed that they had held three meetings with the state government but to no avail. However, he assured the local industrialists that as soon as the state government decides on the land, the ministry would release its share of money for the project.

On the question raised by Rajya Sabha member Lala Lajpat Rai regarding bringing small-scale hosiery manufacturers in the excise net, Rana appreciating their concern, said the government was aware of their problems and he had already spoken to the finance minister in this regard.

Though he declined to comment further on the issue but added that he would strongly recommend their representation in the case and forward the same to the FM for action.

However, he mentioned that the proposed VAT system would have long term benefits for the industry and the national economy. The local associations submitted a memorandum to him in this regard.

Earlier, Rana attributed decreasing exports to disintegration of erstwhile Soviet Union and worldwide recession. He disclosed that Rs 5,000 crore was released against sanctioned sum of Rs 9,000 crore under technology up gradation scheme for textile units.

15,Poultry farmers resorting to suicide,"LUDHIANA: In the past four months, two debt- ridden poultry farmers have committed suicide, and another is on the deathbed in the hospital. Rajinder Singh of Malwa Poultry farm, Moga was the second farmer to end his life on March 16.

PPS Gill, president of the Punjab Poultry Farmers Association claims that each farmer pools in 15 paise from his pocket, while eggs are sold at the rate of Rs 98 for 100 eggs in the market. Then, why donâ€™t the farmers raise the price? It is a perishable item, one can do little but to sell it at a cheaper price. Inderjeet S Kang, who is the proprietor of the Kang Poultry Farm near Samrala said, â€œUnlike other businesses, we cannot stop production, when things donâ€™t go our way.â€�

It is the drought, which has broken the farmersâ€™ back. Consequential price hike in maize, bajra, broken rice, and soya cake has lead to an unaffordable feed for the hens.

Matters could still improve for the debt-ridden farmers, if the government would shell out their long promised subsidy. â€œA 25 per cent subsidy offered to the sector seven years back has become a joke and farmers have lost hope. We have fought with three governments for our due, which would amount to a Rs 25 crore today after seven yearsâ€™ pending payments, but in vain,â€� points out Sanjeev Mehta, proprietor, Mehta Poultry Farm at Rajpura.

Dr GS Chahal, director, animal husbandry said the subsidy offered was by the industrial sector, and no subsidy was pending with him. He said that the tax to be implied would fall under VAT, and he could do little about it.

Meanwhile, the cyclic behaviour, he said, takes care of itself, and when there is no demand for the product, the small timers are likely to leave this field. Gill explicates that there are 350 poultry farmers in Punjab, and about one crore hens, producing a crore eggs each day.

He said while each one of them could claim that the eggs are purely vegetarian, the BJP and other political parties have gone out of the way to depreciate the product. Stopping the midday meal for government school children has also lead to a decline in the sale.

The sector is also weary of the forthcoming two per cent tax levied in absence of the octroi commencing April 1, while the sector under rural products did not pay the octroi. Members term it to be the last straw on the camelâ€™s back, which left them with little choice, but to take extreme steps, like their colleagues did in the past months.
