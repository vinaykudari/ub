4,Official arrested for taking bribe,"NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has caught a senior officer of the Military Intelligence Service (MIS) allegedly abusing his official position. Commander (works engineer) A K Gupta is posted in Raigad.

The complainant who works directly under the accused reported the matter to the CBI which laid a trap and arrested the accused red-handed while demanding and accepting bribe of Rs. 22,500. Searches were later conducted at his residential premises.

The agency has also arrested the additional director of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) under corruption charges. K S Bhatt allegedly sought a bribe of Rs 2 lakh from the complainant.

5,Iskcon holds Festival of Chariots in city,"NEW DELHI: A carriage carrying three deities, drum beats, and chants of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna resounding in the air. For a moment it appeared that one had been transported to Jagannath Puri.

But this was the Festival of Chariots organised by Iskcon on Tuesday evening to mark Sri Jagannath Rath Yatra in Puri.

â€˜â€˜Traditionally, the main yatra is held every year in Puri, but our founder Swami Prabhupadaji came up with the concept of holding processions in other cities as well. Today over 300 yatras are held all over the world,â€™â€™ said Iskcon PRO Hanuman Das.

â€˜â€˜Although six rath yatras are organised in Delhi every year, todayâ€™s yatra holds special significance as it coincides with the main yatra that takes place in Puri,â€™â€™ he added.

Iskcon temples attract devotees from all over the world and the chariot procession was no different. Clad in a saree with sandal paste on her forehead, Anita Marie, a Polish national, was just one of the many devotees lost in prayer as the procession moved on. â€˜â€˜The Lord brought me here today. Iâ€™ve been to Vrindavan and have attended other yatras and prayers. It gives me a sense of complete peace,â€™â€™ she said.

Also notable was the presence of people from all age groups and social backgrounds. Men, women, young adults, children â€” everybody seemed to be jostling to pull the ropes of the Lordâ€™s chariot.

â€˜â€˜I lived in the US for 10 years and have recently come to Delhi after completing my studies. What attracted me to Iskcon was that I could understand the philosophy behind rituals and the religion itself with the help of English text. My friends may not be interested in it, but I am here for this yatra simply because it gives me joy,â€™â€™ said Amit a young devotee.

While some may have been present out of devotion, and others out of curiosity â€” the Festival of Chariots certainly infused a sense of peace and relief from the maddening pace of city life.

6,Confusion at LU over govt order for fee structure,"LUCKNOW: Even as the admission process at Lucknow University has been in a limbo due to the delay in the issuing of a formal government order (GO) on the common fee structure, teachers on campus fear that if the proposed fee structure is imposed in the very form that it was announced, many of the self-financed courses would have to be closed.

However, the LU officials and teaching staff are pinning their hopes on the formal government order, which they hope will give them some scope of survival. There are also concerns that the academic session could end up being delayed due to this delay in this GO being issued.

Five days have passed since the state cabinet approved the fee structure, and LU authorities postponed the counselling for LU Management Admission Test, although results were declared on Tuesday. They said that the counselling for the post-graduate course admissions might also be deferred. When LU officials contacted officers in the higher education department in this regard on Tuesday, they were told that it would take at least 3-4 days for a formal order.

â€œWe have also not been given the details yet. After drafting, the normal process would include approval by the law department and the minister concerned, and thereafter, it will be dispatched to the universities and educational institutions,â€� a higher education department officer told the LU registrarâ€™s office. Confusion prevailed amongst LU faculty members and officers as, while the common fee structure prescribes Rs 13,000 as fee for the non-AICTE approved courses; Rs 19,000 for the AICTE approved courses; Rs 6,000 for the self-financed post-graduate courses and Rs 5,000 for the self-financed graduation courses, there was no mention of the fee structure for these courses.

There are over 60 self-financed courses in LU, including two dozen diploma courses. LU faculty members said that if the fee structure proposed by minister was the maximum that could be charged from students, then LU would have to put an end to many of the courses. â€œThe options left with us would be either to increase the number of seats or charge extra fee under some other head/ heads, to compensate for the loss,â€� said an LU faculty member, pointing out that a loss of at least Rs 2 crore would be suffered by the self-financed management courses under the Institute of Management Science, LU.

Several courses like Bachelor of Computer Science and PG Diploma in Electronic Media and Film Production would have to be closed.

7,Is Mayawati gearing up for snap polls?,"LUCKNOW: Will chief minister Mayawati opt for snap polls for the vidhan sabha? This question is doing the rounds ever since word filtered out that the chief minister asked her partymen on Monday to get ready for the vidhan sabha polls. She is reported to have said the poll could take place any time.

The chief minister was addressing the Bahujan Samaj Party coordinators at her residence on Monday. She also said that the plight of the poor would not improve unless the BSP assumed power at the Centre.

Party supremo Kanshi Ramâ€™s statement at Jabalpur that the BSP would contest all the 543 Lok Sabha seats also indicated that the BSP was now aiming for power at the Centre.

On Sunday, she held a meeting of party workers, office-bearers and legislators at a place reserved for holding rallies.

Delivering homilies to party workers, Mayawati told them that new recruits in the party should be taught about the culture of the BSP and never run after ministerial positions. In the same vein, she told them to weed out men with doubtful loyalty. She also hurled accusations on the Centre for her inability to carry on schemes to remove unemployment. Mayawati said that her request for more funds for this purpose was never heeded by the Centre.

After the party meeting, Mayawati had convened a meeting of coordinators at her residence where she told them that the victory of the BSP was sine qua non for dalitsâ€™ welfare.

During the past several meetings when Mayawati addressed workers, she repeatedly told them to get ready for the polls because unless the BSP assumed power at the Centre, plight of the poor would remain the same. She reportedly told partymen that polls could take place at any time.

The chief minister, who went on a review tour of western Uttar Pradesh, suspended officials and gave them adverse entry in a calculated way. She was harsh on officials known to have sympathy for her opponents in the western region of the state, said a party worker.

Many of those suspended were Jats, he added. The number of dalit officials getting stick was by and large few.

The increased acrimony between Jats and dalits could always be helpful for the BSP.ased acrimony among Jats and Jatavs may prove beneficial for the BSP. For the past several years the number of Jat-Jatav clash had gone down but the aggressive posture taken by Ajit Singh may infuse fresh bitterness in the two communities and this would further strengthen the hands of Mayawati.

Besides, the govenmentâ€™s fiat to give electricity in all Dalit villages by stipulated time would also boost the prospect of BSP.

Even on Ayodhya when the BJP and its allies are speaking on the Shankarachaya formula to resolve the Ramjanambhoomi-Babri Masjid issue, the chief minister was moving with great caution.

8,Stringent laws failed to check dummies in polls,"LUCKNOW: In spite of stringent rules framed by the government to discourage non-serious candidates from poll fray, the number of such contestants is not falling drastically in Uttar Pradesh. However, such candidates prefer to try their luck in the parliamentary rather than the assembly polls.

While the number of dummy candidates in the last vidhan sabha elections in the state was 213, the last two parliamentary polls had 991 dummy candidates who were found guilty by the EC of filing false returns. Many of them did not file any returns at all.

Those found guilty of filing false returns had been debarred from contesting the polls for a period of five years from the date of pronouncement of the verdict against them. But this seldom deterred others from taking the chance at the polls, said an official of the EC. Taking into account the number of candidates punished by the EC for filing false returns or no return, the state had altogether 1,935. Prior to the 2002 assembly polls their number was 1,722.

Another notable feature regarding dummy candidates is that their number is more in western Uttar Pradesh, the land of rural rich. For instance, the number of such candidates in Shajahanpur, Moradabad, Bijnore and many other constituencies in the region was rather high. In some of them the number was nearly a dozen.

The dummy candidates also like to flock to VIP constituencies. In Amethi, considered a pocket borough of the Gandhis, there were nine dummy candidates in the last elections. In Ballia from where former prime minister Chandrasekhar has been winning since 1977, with only one break, there were had 17 dummy candidates. The number of dummy candidates in Mainpuri from where Mulyam Singh Yadav contested the polls had 22 dummy candidates.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeâ€™s Lucknow constituency had 10 dummy candidates. Rae Bareli, a constituency represented by late Indira Gandhi, had also significant number of dummy candidates in the past, said an official of the EC.

All these candidates were found guilty of filing false returns or no return at all. The Election Commissionâ€™s repeated requests to them to file returns for the expenses incurred by them for the polls did not evoke any response, said the EC official. Eventually, the EC debarred them from contesting polls for a period of five years, the official added.

9,Dowry death: In-laws' house burnt down,"CHIKMAGALUR: Enraged by a womanâ€™s death due to alleged harassment, family members set fire to her in-lawsâ€™ house at Birur in Kadur taluk on Sunday destroying property worth lakhs.

10,Devotees throng to pull Lord's chariot,"PATNA: Thousands of devotees of Lord Jagannath from all over the state, gathered near the Srikrishna Memorial Hall here on Tuesday to pull the Lord''s chariot. The rath yatra began after governor M Rama Jois offered puja. The rath yatra organised every year, was organised this year by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), Patna unit.

The devotees were so enthusiastic that they started trickling in in small groups almost two hours before the scheduled time of the yatra. Some of them, especially women, eagerly swept the path on which the rath was to pass. Acharya Ram Ratan Bharadwaj and Ram Murati Das performed the rituals before the rath yatra started. Devotees were seen dancing in front of the rath amidst chanting of ''Hare Rama Hare Krishna''.

Maha Vishnu Swami, a British devotee, who was given this name by his spiritual guru and founder of ISKCON, Bhaktivedant Swami Prabhupada, said that according to Hindu mythology when the people of Vrindavan wanted Lord Krishna to return, they pulled his chariot to please him.

Answering a query, he said that people tend to forget that they are the servants of the Lord and take him for a ride. By doing this they invite misery, he added.

State president of ISKCON, Krishna Kripa Das, said the objective behind organising the rath yatra is to spread the message of brotherhood among the masses. Acharya Bhardwaj said that according to Hindu belief every year on â€˜Dvitiya of Asadh Shukla Pakshaâ€™, Lord Jagannath, comes out of the temple to see the devotees. It is also believed that one who gets a chance to pull the chariot of the Lord gets nirvana (salvation).

11,Puri Rath Yatra rolls in a riot of colours,"PURI: It was a riot of colours and a sea of humanity. Amid chants of â€˜Jai Jagannath Haribolâ€™ reverberating the thick overcast sky of this pilgrim city, the Rath Yatra was celebrated on Tuesday.

The three-km-long Badadanda (grand road) leading to the Sri Gundicha Temple was lined with lakhs of devotees pulling the three chariots carrying Lord Jagannath, his elder brother Lord Balabhadra and sister Goddess Subhadra.

Apart from the sanyasis, sadhus, gurus, Iskcon devotees and religious fanatics, a large number of newly wed couples pulled the raths seeking the Lordâ€™s blessings for a happy union.

Besides eminent personalities and dignitaries from home and abroad, 47 inmates of the Puri open air jail witnessed the journey under the supervision of ADG (prisons) G.K. Das. Since early morning, devotees had thronged the Lions Gate, anxiously waiting for the ceremonial pahandi procession, with most of them even sleeping on the road to ensure a vantage position.

Inside the sanctum sanctorum, the priests went about their daily chores and even offered Gopal bhoga. It was then that the pahandi procession began which could not have been more colourful what with the beating of drums and cymbals, blowing of trumpets and conchshells to the recital of hymns and daita servitors dancing their hearts out.

Of course the clouds held back despite the sky being overcast. Yet, the moment Lord Jagannath appeared at the temple main gate, it started drizzling.

12,Principal buys Sun for Rs 15 cr,"NEW DELHI: Principal Mutual Fund, owned by the US-based Principal Financial Group, has acquired Rs 500 crore Sun F&C Mutual Fund. Principal paid around Rs 15 crore for the deal, sources said.

Confirming the deal, PMF MD Sanjay Sachdeva said that it would help the company achieve the optimum size. At present, PMF manages Rs 2,000 crore fund. The minimum size of a fund should be around Rs 3,500 crore to have a profitable operation.

Sachdeva said Principal was acquiring only the assets and not the asset management company. Therefore, the acquisition would not result into transfer of staffs of Sun F&C to Principal. NRI Khemka and F&C are the major shareholders and own around 90 per cent stake in Sun F&C. The rest 10 per cent is owned by its CEO Nikhil Khatau.

Prior to this, Principal has acquired the 50 per cent stake held by IDBI in the Principal Mutual Fund for Rs 90 crore. The deal was considered to be costly one. But that had given Principal free hand to expand their operations in India.

Later, to meet FDI guidelines, Principal gave its 25 per cent stake to PNB Mutual Fund.

The present deal between Principal and Sun F&C is the testimony of the consolidation of the mutual fund industry in the country. Prior to this, Templeton had acquired Rs 3,500 ITI for Rs 250 crore in 2002. In the deal, the payment was made at the rate of 7 per cent of the asset size. The deal made the combined asset size of Templeton to over Rs 10,000 crore.

In the second deal which matured in March 2003, HDFC Mutual Fund acquired Rs 3,300 crore Zurich Mutual fund for Rs 160 crore. The deal was done at around 5 per cent. After the deal, the combined fund size of the new entity was Rs 10,500 crore.

But in the present deal, as the size of the fund was small â€” much less that Rs 3,000 crore, a senior merchant banker said the price offered was much lower than what was offered in the earlier two cases.

He said that because of the small size, the Sun F&C on stand alone basis is not very profitable venture. At the same time, their equity fund size is only Rs 100 crore.

Therefore, he said that the acquirers were not ready to offer more than 3 per cent of the asset size. Beside Principal ING Mutual Fund was also bidding for the fund.

16,Stamp racket kingpin Telgi's brother arrested,"BANGALORE: Stamp paper racket kingpin Abdul Kareem Telgi alias Kareem Lala''s younger brother, Azim Telgi, who is vice-president of the Khanapur town municipal council in Karnataka, was arrested by the Special Stamp Paper Investigation Team (Stampit) on Tuesday.

He was produced before a court on Wednesday and later handed over to the Pune police.

Azim was wanted by the Pune police, which busted a Rs 2,000-crore stamp paper racket recently and arrested Samajwadi Janata Party MLA Anil Gote. After the racket came to light, the Pune police requested Stampit to keep a watch on Azim.

The over Rs 10,000-crore stamp paper racket, with inter-state ramifications, has been found to have spread across the country. The Karnataka government has banned stamp papers to get rid of the menace.

Meanwhile, Stampit has filed an application before the Karnataka High Court seeking Kareem Lala''s custody for investigation. Lala has been lodged in the Central Jail in Bangalore.

18,World Bank funds: Health of hospitals worries govt,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka government is in a dilemma â€” to increase or not to increase â€˜user chargeâ€™ in hospitals run by it. Any decision either way is going to hurt the government.

The pivot of this dilemma is the Rs 580-crore World Bank-aided Karnataka Health Systems Development Project (KHSDP) which is drawing to a close.

Once the funds stop flowing, the health department feels it will be difficult for the government to support the 200-odd hospitals.

And to make good the shortfall, the government has to hike the user charge â€” a decision it prefers to defer. All because it is not keen on taxing the poor, and secondly, elections are due next year.

Presently, the KHSDP pays salaries to the hospital staff, besides outsourcing facilities. ""Once the aid stops, the government has to bear the entire cost of maintaining the hospitals. But grants from the government are not sufficient. Revising the charges will help the hospitals in terms of resource mobilisation,"" sources said.

Though medical education minister A.B. Maalaka Raddy admits that maintaining a hospital has become a costly affair for the government, he is not in favour of revising the charges.

So far, hospitals have collected Rs 9 crore as user charges after the WB project commenced in 1997. ""With the levying of user charges, many district hospitals do not depend on taluk or zilla panchayat funds. But the rates charged are too minimal,"" sources said.

User charges are levied only on those whose annual income is more than Rs 8,000. For those below this income, treatment is free.

In a statement, Association president A. Prakash pointed out that the government had made it mandatory for the publishers to procure printing paper from a single agency â€” Mysore Paper Mills (MPM).

â€œSometimes, MPM does not supply printing paper on time due to transportation problem. Publishers cannot meet the deadline for printing text books if there is delay in supply of printing paper,â€™â€™ he said.

Besides, the government was making deferred payment of bills to publishers. â€œIf bills are not cleared within a stipulated period, the time-frame of publishing books will be upset,â€™â€™ he added and urged the government to look into the two issues.

20,"We won't desert you, govt tells rural weightage staff","BANGALORE: The Karnataka Cabinet on Wednesday decided to retain the services of 4,000 employees selected on rural weightage basis till the hearing on its review petition in the Supreme Court is completed.

""If the verdict is not in our favour, we have to discharge all 4,000 employees from duty. But they will be reappointed by framing special rules,"" law and parliamentary affairs minister D.B. Chandre Gowda told reporters here after the meeting.

The petition filed by the government seeking review of its order relating to rural weightage in recruitment is likely to come up for hearing either on July 3 or 7, he said.

Gowda claimed that only 4,000 of the total 13,400 employees selected on rural weightage basis would be affected by the previous order of the Supreme Court.

""We are committed to protect the interests of these 4,000 employees. The government reassures them that they will not be deserted at any cost. They will be accommodated in some department,"" he said.

The government had appealed to the court to review its order on humanitarian grounds. It stated that the recruitment based on rural weightage would remain a one-time operation.

It is the second such petition filed before the Supreme Court in the last three months. Recently, affected employees had moved the Supreme Court vacation bench, which directed them to approach the regular court that quashed rural weightage.

The rural weightage norm applied to the Karnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules 1976 (rural students were given an additional 15 marks in their qualifying exams to bring parity with urban candidates while being recruited) was introduced in 1998.

However, it was struck down by the Supreme Court and the fate of 4,000 employees selected on the basis of rural weightage hangs in balance.
