0,Hindu College hostelers clash over party invites,"NEW DELHI: The rivalry between student groups in the Hindu College hostel came to the fore on Thursday night when hostelers allegedly beat up two co-residents in the north campus area.

The two final year students, Roktim and Manish, have been hurt in their head, neck and back. A case of assault has been registered against the aggressors.

Hostel insiders said rivalry between students from the northeast and Bihar had been smouldering for a while and skirmishes keep taking place from time to time.

Thursdayâ€™s incident was allegedly sparked by a party organised on Monday night by Roktim, a sociology student. He had appeared in the entrance examination for Jawaharlal Nehru University and had reportedly topped the entrance.

â€˜â€˜He had invited only Assamese students to the celebration. But Sandeep, a student from Bihar, demanded to know why students from his region had not been invited,â€™â€™ the police said. There was a hot exchange of word at this. Hostel warden K R Sharma claimed the party was organised outside the hostel. On Thursday night, Roktim along with his friend Manish, an English student, was going to Outram Lines to meet a few friends.

1,No solution for trucks,"NEW DELHI: Lack of coordination between Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (UP) has led to non-compliance with the Supreme Court order banning the entry of trucks not carrying goods for Delhi into the city.

The apex court, which had directed city police commissioner to bar the entry of such trucks, pulled up the authorities on Monday for non-compliance.

The fact that only one meeting has taken place between the city police, transport department, municipal corporation, traffic police, and the officials from neighbouring states in the past seven months indicates the pace of things.

Senior police officers, however, deny any coordination problem. To drive the point home, the police commissioner met senior officers on Tuesday to discuss the matter.

â€˜â€˜The alternative routes should be planned and built before the orders are implemented,â€™â€™ said T S Reddy, head traffic and transportation department at Central Road Research Institute (CRRI).

Reddy said when a similar exercise was carried out in United Kingdom (UK) about 20 years back, the routes were identified and were built to withstand the weight of goods-laden trucks.

In Delhiâ€™s case, the roads need to be built by the civic agencies of Haryana and UP. While UP has not responded till date, the Haryana chief secretary shot said additional funds will be required from the Union government.

2,PSC alleges lack of help from govt in corruption probe,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal Public Service Commission has complained of non-cooperation from government departments while probing corruption charges against officials. Earlier, the state vigilance commission and the comptroller and auditor general of India had also made similar allegations.

â€œThe commission reiterates its earlier observation that most of the the disciplinary cases being referred to it for advice are without necessary documents and particulars,â€� commented the PSC in its latest report for 1997-98, tabled in the Assembly.

According to it, out of the 32 cases referred during the year, 20 were old cases which had earlier been sent back to the govern-ment. Even then, 25 cases including â€œa lot of said old casesâ€� â€” found wanting in relevant documents â€” were returned to the gov-ernment yet again. The government accepted the recommendations only in one out of the seven cases probed that year and decisions regarding the re-maining six were not even informed to the PSC. Bhattacharjee admitted his babudomâ€™s antipathy to the probes. â€œI know many departments did not provide papers asked by the commissions. This has accumulated corruption charges,â€� he told the House recently.

The PSC was concerned with the â€œspate of ad-hoc appointmentsâ€� and it was more worried as the government approached it to regularise such appointments without consulting it beforehand. The co-operation department was held responsible for regularisa-tion as many as 129 officers â€œoverridingâ€� the PSC on an ad-hoc basis. The department even issued notifications to get exemption from consultation with the commission. That was termed â€œunconstitutionalâ€� in the report.

Though the government assured steps for rescinding the notifica-tions, it kept mum on the irregular appointments. The health and family welfare department regularised 26 medical officers without consulting the PSC and the latter refusing to accept it.

The PSC even recommended the re-introduction of admission fees from job aspirants to ensure that â€œserious candidatesâ€� applied as there were nearly 200,000 absentees among the 400,000 candi-dates for various exams. The state government had stopped fees since 1990 as a gesture to the unemployed youth.

3,Lawyers protest in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: Lawyers in Ghaziabad struck work on Thursday over the alleged involvement of some judicial officers in making the surrender of three abductors easy before the chief judicial magistrate.

The agitating lawyers marched through the courtâ€™s corridor and shouted slogans against judges. A resolution was moved by the secretary of bar association Pramod Sharma. The association demanded a probe and copies of it sent to the chief justice of Supreme Court and the Allahabad high court.

When contacted, acting district judge A K Agarwal said, â€˜â€˜I do not know which judicial officials are allegedly involved. But the high court has been told of the allegations, and an inquiry will be conducted in this regard.â€™â€™

The lawyers alleged that the accused who had abducted Vishal Sarawat, a management student for a ransom of Rs 32 lakh, were taken for surrender in a judgeâ€™s car.

According to police, one of the abductors admitted that they were taken to the residence of an official in Govindpuram on Tuesday. From their they went in the judgeâ€™s car and used the entrance meant for judges to get into the court. While the police were waiting at the courtâ€™s common entrance to arrest the three accused.

Meanwhile, the chief judicial magistrate declined to send the accused to judicial custody, as the Kavi Nagar police station had not submitted a report on the matter.

On the Govindpuram-based official not being questioned, district police chief Chandra Prakash said, â€˜â€˜We are still investigating the matter. At this stage, we cannot name the official.â€™â€™

4,Suicides among riot-hit on the rise,"AHMEDABAD: The situation in the state might have returned to normal, but the death toll is still ticking.

In the past 45 days, 18 suicide cases have been reported in the city and a majority of these cases are directly related to loss of business in a riot-torn city.

Shailesh Panchal is a distraught man today. His wife Meena immolated herself along with their three children on June 25. Riots delivered a body blow to his 10-year-old printing business as he failed to get any kind of order in the last four months.

With a seven member family, including ailing parents to feed, there is absolutely no hope.

Narendra Patel and three other family members ended their lives in a guest house near Gita Mandir in Ahmedabad on June 3. Patel was in the dairy business that was badly hit in the recent riots forcing his family to take such a drastic step.

Popat Prajapati along with his wife and two sons hanged themselves at their Naroda-Kathwada residence on July 12. His book-binding business suffered heavy losses - thanks to the communal carnage.

""First came the earthquake. Then the riots. We had virtually no orders in the past four months,"" says Shailesh Panchal, who joined the family business after quitting his job.

""With a job, at least, you are assured of a fixed income. How long can one survive on meagre savings? It has been a real tough time in the last four months,"" he says with tears running down his cheeks.

According to family members, Meena who used to help her husband in the business, took the extreme step following her helplessness to pay the school fees of her twin daughters.

""How can I live without my young son?"" says Panchal, looking blankly at a family photograph.

Talking about the sudden rise in such cases in the city, additional commissioner of Police, Satish Sharma said, ""It is difficult to jump to any conclusion, but undoubtedly we have come across such cases in the last few days.""

""Most of these suicides are by members of the majority community, who were devastated by the economic fallout of the riots,"" says an analyst. He added: ""Those who did not find anything wrong with the riots should note this, it was not the minority alone who were affected but the majority community members too.""

""It''s quite natural that when people suffer economic losses or they do not have work, they feel depressed. These suicide cases are also a manifestation of post traumatic stress order. Economic uncertainty can lead to severe depression that sometimes leads to suicide. In the post-riots period, things have been really difficult for many and huge business losses have forced many to end their lives along with family members,"" says Sohan Derasari, a psychiatrist.

It is not easy for somebody who has lost his daily bread, but suicide is not something that a person resorts to easily. This means that for each one who has committed suicde there are hundreds who are still suffering in agony.

8,Four arrested for B Tech question paper leak,"HYDERABAD: The CID on Thursday arrested four persons in connection with the leakage of B.Tech question papers last month-end.

According to a press release, investigations revealed that the leak did not happen at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), which originally registered a complaint after a student was caught in possession of a cyclostyled copy of a question paper on June 30.

According to the CID press release, the leak happened at an engineering college in Peddapuram. Police said the question papers were stolen by a junior assistant and an attender with the Aditya Engineering College, Peddapuram.

According to the police, the junior assistant, Shaik Hussain Sahab (35) of Visakhapatnam, and the attendant, Anantha Chinna Babu (19) of East Godavari, broke open the principalâ€™s almirah, where the question papers where stored, on the midnight of June 18.

With the help of canteen owner K Bhaskar (26) of East Godavari and his brother Girish (20), they hurriedly photocopied the question papers. The gang copied question papers of six subjects, except English, investigations revealed.

The question papers thus leaked from Peddapuram, reached Hyderabad through telephone, fax and other mediums of communication.

9,"Image mantra: Feed IT, starve farmers","HYDERABAD: The farmers may be driven to desperation by the unending power cuts and industry may be sweltering from frequent outages, but the state government is determined to keep information technology companies in air-conditioned comfort.In a bid to preserve the 'IT-savvy' image of chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, government officials have made sure that no information technology company in the state suffers due to the power shortage.Information technology companies have so far been completely insulated from load-shedding because the chief minister himself had promised continuous power supply to all IT companies, sources in the industry said.In fact, the government passed a government order (GO Ms No 67, dated July 21, 1998) to protect the sector from power disruptions. The GO states that IT companies would be exempt from the statutory power cuts imposed by the AP Transmission Corporation Limited (Transco).Such an assurance is applicable to no other sector of industry nor to agriculture. Besides providing for subsidies and facilities such as dedicated feeders, the GO also states that IT units shall be given top priority in giving new power connections.A senior Transco official of the technical wing told The Times of India that some major IT companies in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada have long-pending unpaid power bills but when the load-shedding schedule is drawn up, utmost care is taken to see that IT companies do not suffer from the power cut.However, the government's faith in IT seems not to be reciprocated. No IT company in the state relies entirely on Transco's tenuous power supply.They consider it to be an unreliable service, and rely on their own generators, a senior official of the information technology and communication department said.

11,BJP inching away from TDP,"HYDERABAD: The sudden love for distribution of surplus land to the economically weaker sections of the society by the Bharatiya Janata Party is a well calculated political strategy.

According to a BJP leader, the campaign is a twin-edged weaponâ€” one it would help those who hold excess land to dispose of their land without the fear of attracting the wrath of the naxalites, particularly in the Telangana region and secondly, it was a slogan to rejuvenate the cadre and prepare them to fight the next Assembly elections on their own, in case they decide to part ways with the TDP.

According to the BJP leader, the possibility of parting ways was more, if elections to the Assembly and the Lok Sabha were held separately.

The leader told The Times of India that after the restoration of relations between the BJP and the TDP, which suffered a setback following the Gujarat carnage, there was no question of breaking the alliance till the next Assembly polls.

The state unit of the BJP, he said, was still not clear whether they would jointly fight the Assembly elections or not.

While not doing anything that would upset the BJPâ€™s applecart at the Centre, the state unit has been asked by the party high command to gear up the rank and file to be ready to fight the next elections on their own, if need be.

Unless the BJP goes hammer and tongs against the TDP right from now, it would not be able to go it alone in the polls. But such a thing was unthinkable as of now. Hence, the state unit has decided to find a mid path to rake up issues like land to those who can till.

This would not only get support from all sections, including the ruling party, but also help the BJP cadre to take a dig at the TDP once in a while. In case, it has to go it alone in the elections, this could be one of the main electoral slogans for them.

Raising the issue under Rule 304 for a short discussion on Thursday, which got converted into a four-hour debate, and was supported by all parties,was an effort to test the waters, he added.

12,Varsity students protest fee hike,"PUNE: In what seems to be deepening into one of the worst crisis in recent times for the University of Pune, the ongoing row between the university and the students over the recent fee hike has entered into a deadlock, with both the sides refusing to budge from their stand.

While vice-chancellor Ashok Kolaskar ruled out chances of any roll back, the students too have decided to boycott classes until their demands are met.

The protesting students, including junior and senior research fellows and Ph.D students, in a late afternoon decision on Thursday, decided to carry on their agitation by holding demonstrations outside their classrooms in the university campus.

Under its revised fee structure, the university has hiked the fees of various courses, including M.Sc (biotechnology/biochemistry) from Rs 1,500 to a whopping Rs 10,000; M.Sc (petroleum, Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000) and MSW.

The university, meanwhile, has clarified that the revised fee would be applicable only for first year students.

In a circular, which was issued late on Wednesday afternoon, it said the gymkhana and the magazine fee of Rs 100 each is only applicable in those institutes where the facilities are available.

The students, numbering around 500 and drawn from various departments, gathered near the main office at 11 am, demanding that the vicechancellor should come out from his chambers for a dialogue with the students on the issue.

Meanwhile, final-year students of the environmental science department complained that their marksheets had been withheld due to nonpayment of the revised fee.

With Kolaskar refusing to oblige and the students too refusing to budge, finally it was left to deputy commissioner of police (zone III) Naval Bajaj to intervene at the university on Thursday, and convince the students to send in a delegation for a dialogue with the VC.

The police had a harrowing time controlling the agitated students, who blocked the road to the main building. Repeated attempts to pacify the protesters failed to yield any results.

Shouting slogans like â€˜V-murdabadâ€™, â€˜V-C come out under the sunâ€™, â€˜no roll-back, no classesâ€™, the students accused the vice-chancellor of raising the fee without even consulting them.

13,"Gujarat House may be dissolved, polls in Oct","NEW DELHI: With authoritative sources in the government here saying that Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi will recommend dissolution of the state assembly within a few days, in the expectation that the elections can be held in October along with Jammu and Kashmir, it is clear that the Advani line has prevailed.

So far, the Prime Minister Vajpayee had been of the view that rehabilitation is the top priority in Gujarat and that the elections should be held only after the situation has returned to normal.

On Thursday, however, it was clear that the PM had been â€˜â€˜persuadedâ€™â€™ to think otherwise by the Deputy PM and the BJPâ€™s Gujarat state unit.

The BJP state unitâ€™s assessment is that currently, 60 of the 182 assembly constituencies in the state are â€˜â€˜totally polarisedâ€™â€™ and it can win another 50-odd seats, which would give it a clear majority.

Another factor that has helped the BJP leadership take a decision is the remark of KPS Gill, till recently security adviser to Modi, that elections should be held sooner rather than later.

According to sources, Gillâ€™s reading is that as long as elections are not held, incidents of violence will continue.

The BJP state unit is worried on two counts: one, that if has to wait till February next year, the current â€˜â€˜highâ€™â€™ may vanish, and two, the appointment of Shakarsinh Vaghela, a former BJP leader, as the Gujarat Congress chief has galavanised them into action.

14,"Mahanta on comeback trail, slams Gogoi govt","GUWAHATI: Former Assam Chief Minister P K Mahanta, who has been living in virtual political exile, has charged the Tarun Gogoi government in the state with all-round failure.

In an interview with Times News Network, Mahanta said the people had supported the Congress based on the promises made by its leaders but the promises had proved to be nothing but ""a pack of lies"".

He said the Congress party had promised to solve the financial problems of the state including the fate of lakhs of government employees but the government had failed to provide salaries to them on time. This was evident from the agitational programmes launched by the same employees who had once praised the Congress, he said.

Mahanta, who has been keeping a low profile since August last year when he had to resign from the post of Party President under compelling circumstances, said that the government had failed miserable on the law and order front too.

Nineteen people had been killed by militants in the last four days and the state government had no idea of what was happening, he alleged. He said the Gogoi government was just rolling the ball in the Centre''s court by saying that they should follow the same principal of holding talks with Ulfa which they followed with NSCN (IM), thus exposing the lack of any political solution.

Mahanta also said the government has no plans for development of the state. â€œShow me one major project which they have undertaken,â€� he asked.

When asked if his tour to upper Assam was to strengthen his position among the grass root workers of the party, Mahanta said he had no plans of making a comeback unless the party decides so.

The tour of Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Sibsagar districts was to see for himself the condition of the state and also meet his â€œfriendsâ€�. He also plans to visit the family members of former Assam Finance Minister late Jiba Kanta Gogoi during his visit to Golaghat district, he said.

Although he''s denying it, looks like Mahanta is on the comeback trail.

On amendments to Pota, he said, ""not immediately.""

Fernandes arrived here from New Delhi on Friday morning to meet Vaiko, arrested and incarcerated under Pota for addressing a public meeting at Thirumangalam near Madurai on June 29.

16,Cong wants President's rule in Gujarat before polls,"NEW DELHI: The Congress has demanded the imposition of President''s rule in Gujarat as a prerequisite for free and fair elections in the state.

Criticising the Narendra Modi government for seeking dissolution of the Assembly for early polls, senior Congress leader and spokesman Jaipal Reddy told Times News Network: ""The BJP is trying to make an extremely wicked attempt to exploit the communal divide following the recent massacres in Gujarat.""

Demanding Central rule before elections were held, Reddy said ""with Narendra Modi as chief minister it is difficult to instill confidence among all people that elections will be free and fair.""

The Congress leader said that about 3 lakh refugees had not been resettled and they did not even have identity slips. ""The EC must make all attempts to see that their voting rights are protected and that they are not disenfranchised.""

""But despite all handicaps"", Reddy said, ""the Congress is in a strong position to win the elections. It has won all elections rural and urban in Gujarat before, during and after the disturbances. Therefore, this vicious bid to cash in on the communal tension will be frustrated.""

The matter is likely to cause a furore in Parliament, too, with the Congress-led Opposition already gearing up to attack the government on Gujarat. Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are also slated to debate the Gujarat issue next week.

19,"Eat rabbit, stay fit says govt","BANGALORE: Rabbit meat, low on fat and high on protein, is extremely nutritious, say officials of the Department of Animal Husbandry. Rabbit meat contains only 3 per cent cholesterol.

Though sold at only Rs 60-100 a kg breast weight and despite its many pluses, broiler rabbit meat makes for a rare dish in Karnataka. ""It is a recommended diet for the aged, hypertensive or diabetic patients. The nutritive value is on par with fish meat,"" says Dr K. Sharmila, veterinary officer (Rabbitry) at Livestock Breeding Farm, Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences at Hesarghatta.

Not many go for the broiler rabbit, either due to social habit or plain compassion. ""It''s difficult to break this perception. The Rabbitry division of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences gives out parent stock of rabbits above eight weeks for Rs 50 each. Farmers are the sole marketers of the meat,"" add officials.

Nevertheless, there have been pockets of awareness on the meat market trend. Farmers have managed annual rate contracts with every restaurant and hotel for rabbit meat consumption in Hosur. ""Over 80 per cent of the residents here are rabbit meat eaters,"" says Dr Sharmila.

Rabbit meat is available at Shivajinagar market, roadside dhabas and local shandies. But few know that broiler rabbit consumption is legal and only an estimated 10 per cent of bred rabbits make it to the dining table.

""Unfortunately, it is difficult to reason out the poor consumption, despite the meat being extremely nutritious,"" lament officials and promoters.

Rabbit rearing for the pharmaceutical industry and as pets for resorts is booming in the state. The Department of Animal Husbandry imports New Zealand White and California White varieties for breeding purposes, mainly for meat consumption. Rabbits sold thus is perceived as a good enterprise for landless rural families and the government is keen on promoting it, maintains Head of Department of Livestock Production and Management, Government Veterinary College, Dr M.M. Kailas.

""Rabbits are prolific breeders. The animal breeds at least four times a year with a litter of five to eight rabbits. That means a female rabbit can breed 90-105 young ones during its reproductive life of three to four years,"" he added.

20,Chohan’s party to contest SGPC poll,"CHANDIGARH: Khalistan ideologue Jagjit Singh Chohan announced here on Friday that his party, Khalsa Raj Party, would contest the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandak Committee elections scheduled later this year.

Talking to mediapersons, Chohan, who returned to India last year after living in the UK for 23 years, also favoured voting rights for sehajdharis, whom he described as part of the Sikh fold. He said it was immaterial whether a sehajdhari sported a beard or was clean shaven. If he believed in Guru Granth Sahib and followed the Sikh tenets, he had every right to vote in the SGPC election, Chohan asserted.

He said his party had resolved to contest the SGPC election because over the years its administration and management had witnessed a steep qualitative deterioration.

The whole system, he said, had been corrupted and needed to be cleansed. This could not be achieved unless the old guard was thrown out and new selfless workers brought in. Chohan called both Parkash Singh Badal and Gurcharan Singh Tohra as â€˜â€˜masters of corruption.â€™â€™ He said if Badal played havoc with the Akali Dal, Tohra seeped the SGPC in corruption. Both were responsible for undermining the dignity of the Sikh institutions. He said it was time both of them were replaced by new faces who could devote themselves selflessly to the cause of the Sikhs.

Though around for almost a year now Chohan admitted that he could structure his party in a formal traditional manner. He denied that he had failed to gather support for his party.
