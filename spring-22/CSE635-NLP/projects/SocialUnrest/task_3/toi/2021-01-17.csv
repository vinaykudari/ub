0,NCW points at lapses in probe between rape and suicide,"AHMEDABAD: The National Commission for Women (NCW) on Saturday pointed at serious lapses in the police investigation between January 1 and 6 (between the gang-rape and suicide of 24-year-old Hetal Joshi (name changed)). Hetal committed suicide on January 7 after she was allegedly raped on the New Year eve at Hotel Ashok Palace.

The NCW team, comprising chairperson Purnima Advani, member Nirmala Sitaram and counsel member Jalil Ahmed, was in the city to conduct an ""independent investigation"" in the case.

Raising a finger of suspicion at the role of the Delhi police, the NCW chairperson Dr Purnima Advani said, the commission would inquire into the role of the Delhi''s Millennium Hospital, where the prime accused Sajal Jain was holed up. ""If we find that the hospital has not co-operated in the case and was providing shelter to the accused, the NCW would ask the respective government to cancel its license,"" she added.

Admitting to initial lackadaisical attitude by the police officers at the concerned police station and deliberations in carrying out the investigation, Advani said, ""After the case was handed over to the senior police officer, the pace of the investigation and the evidences gathered is quite satisfactory.""

Meanwhile, the NCW team, which also meet police commissioner K R Kaushik, recommended that cases of gang rape and rape of minor should be handled by a senior police officer rather then a sub inspector. Stating that the victim would not have committed suicide if there was proper counselling available, Advani said, ""We have also recommend that victims of rape be immediately transferred to the trauma counselling centres. Further, we have asked the state to have more of such centres.""

The NCW team also met the family of the victims at their Usmanpura home in a close door meeting which lasted two hours. They recorded the statements of Hetal''s brother Bhavin, sister Vaishali and parents. Two of other persons residing in the neighbourhood were also questioned.

""I appreciate the family members and the especially the brave sister for going through all this. The family has given us an explicit detail of the gruesome incident and we will probe the case further,"" Advani said.

Later, the team went to meet the prime accused Sajal Jain at the Dariapur police station, followed by which it also met the other accusedâ€” Sugam, Mandan and Chandan Jaiswalâ€”all lodged in the Sabarmati Central Jail. The city police commissioner KR Kaushik briefed the team on behalf of the police.

1,Sulking Patels clamour for political stakes,"AHMEDABAD: The state''s two major political players, the BJP and the Congress, saw a queer kind of precipitation around the same time recently â€” the regrouping among Patels. This community â€” considered wealthy and a formidable votebank in state politics â€” suddenly realised that it was threatened with the resurgence of the OBCs and other communities under the present dispensation in both the ruling BJP and the Congress. And the reassertion manifests itself in many ways in both parties which have non-Patels at the helm.

The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), affiliated to the Sangh Parivar, intensified its agitation against the Narendra Modi government on the power tariff hike, and has become a major headache for the BJP. The party realised that it was not just the power tariff but a bloodline that was bonding the agitation against Modi, an OBC. Incidentally, the Patels, who are landed farmers, comprise a major chunk of the BKS. So it was not surprising when former CM Keshubhai Patel criticised Modi''s style of handling the issue, days after he had addressed at least two major meetings of the Patels.

And this coincided with the differences over the selection of BJP state chief to succeed Rajendrasinh Rana, who completed three-year term. Incidentally, all those considered are Patels. Almost simultaneously, the Congress Legislature Party leader Amarsinh Chaudhary, with the backing of Patels in the Congress, led an agitation to dethrone Shankersinh Vaghela.

Though Chaudhary saw himself leading a rebellion, either consciously or otherwise, it was a fight dominated by the Patels against Vaghela. ""Surely, we want the high castes to take over at least in North Gujarat and Saurashtra"", said a senior Congress leader among the rebel group and a Patel.

And the Shakti Dal launched by Vaghela gave them enough reason to cry hoarse, ''because Shakti Dal in a way, became a conglomeration of the OBCs'', says a veteran Congress leader. Little wonder then, that former CM Madhavsinh Solanki, known for his organisation of the non-Patel groups in the early 80s, extended a stolid support to the Shakti Dal. Informal sources say that of the 25,000 people recruited as its volunteers, nearly 24,000 were OBCs.

Ironically, the response to the Dal was encouraging in the north Gujarat districts of Banaskantha, Gandhinagar and Sabarkantha, a fact that the Patels could not stomach. Simultaneously, in Central Gujarat, a formidable MP representing Kheda constituency of the Patel-dominated wealthy Charotar belt, Dinsha Patel, led a yatra in the memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel â€” once again, a Patel. But Patel denies that his yatra had anything to do with Patels or with politics.

""This was to encourage youngsters to follow the path of the Sardar"". Diplomatically, he steered clear of the controversy surrounding the Shakti Dal and said, ''if good people join the movement, I am for it''.

A section from the Modi camp is already suspecting that the BKS agitation, which has concentrated mainly in Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Banaskantha and scattered areas of Saurashtra, could well have the backing of two formidable Patels, former union minister A K Patel and Keshubhai. paying nearly Rs operators said they independent of Incable. In the process, the company was left with only a handful of connection by December.

2,Was there an earlier suicide attempt?,"AHMEDABAD: Hetal Joshi was left alone at home for barely 10 minutes on the morning of January 7. Was this time enough to write an absolutely flawless suicide note, which was about one-and-a-half-page long, and then commit suicide?

According to her brother Bhavin Joshi, Hetal had made an unsuccessful attempt at committing suicide two days before she died, but the knot of the nylon rope slipped. Bhavin admits that Hetal was living on the edge and there was not a single moment when she was left alone. Bhavin left for a few minutes to get his car battery recharged on the fateful day. Other family members had gone to meet a lawyer. But, apparently, Hetal had prepared for her death much prior to that. Her suicide note was not a hurriedly scribbled one.

3,Minister's relative arrested for links with KLO,"JALPAIGURI/KOLKATA: Forest minister Jogesh Barman''s brother-in-law Shyamal Roy, who was arrested on Friday, is a member of Azad Hind Bahini, a newly-formed organisation allegedly aided by the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation, said Jalpaiguri SP S N Gupta on Saturday.

Roy was arrested following the interrogation of KLO leader Tom Adhikary. Adhikary reportedly told police that rocket propelled grenades belonging to the KLO were kept in Roy''s house. They were removed from his a week before the Royal Bhutan Army launched the flush-out operation on December 15, the KLO leader added.

Tom was held in Bhutan by the RBA during the operation. He was involved in an abortive attempt to kidnap a businessman from Falakata.

Speaking from Jalpaiguri over the phone, the minister said he had nothing to do with his brother-in-law. ""The law will take its own course. I didn''t have any contact with my brother-in-law for a long time,"" Barman said. According to him, the Azad Hind Bahini is a small organisation and is backed by a Kolkata-based ''brahmachari''.

""This organisation is responsible for past attacks on CPM workers,"" said he.

Jalpaiguri Police arrested eight youths on Saturday after interrogating KLO activists in Bhutan on charges of being KLO sympathisers. Following interrogations of KLO activists in Bhutan, eight more youths were arrested by the Jalpaiguri police on Saturday on charge of being KLO sympathisers, the police said.

4,Divorce issue drives software pro to suicide,"HYDERABAD: A software engineer committed suicide by setting himself ablaze at his house at CSR Estates in Saroornagar on Friday night.

Police said that P Srikanth, 34, was depressed ever since he developed differences with his wife Leela and the latter refused to divorce him due to which he might have taken the step.

Police sources revealed that Srikanth -â€” a native of Sripuram Colony in Malakpet -â€” had completed his higher studies in the US and married Leela of Medak district in 1999. The couple lived in the US for some time and returned in June, 2003.

They were not in good terms by the time the couple had returned and Srikanth wanted to divorce his wife.

However, Leela refused to divorce him and went to live with her parents. On Friday, Srikanth locked himself in the house and set himself ablaze. Neighbours heard him cry and informed the police. By the time police reached the place and broke open the door, he was dead, sources said.

Saroornagar police informed his father Chandramouli, a retired officer of the AP Cooperative Bank, living at Sripuram Colony and have registered a case.

5,Lok adalats brainchild of necessity: CJI,"LUCKNOW: Chief Justice of India VN Khare on Saturday called lok adalats a ''brainchild of necessityâ€™ which had been able to provide speedy justice to the people.

Speaking at a seminar on ''Administrative debate and lok adalatsâ€™, the Chief Justice said: ""Judiciary is an essential organ without which there can be no democracy. But the process of delivering justice to the people should be quick. This is one of the requisites of good and independent judiciary.""

The Chief Justice said that delay in justice would obstruct the purpose for which the concept of lok adalats was conceived. The lok adalats, he said, were successful in deliverance of justice outside the purview of courts. ""People now look up to the public courts for deliverance of justice. In the past, people would look up to the village panchayats and other similar bodies whose verdicts were binding on many but that system being no more prevalent, the poor pin their hopes lok adalats,"" he said.

Chief Justice Khare said for the lok adalats it was not only essential to settle disputes but also to honour the concept of an alternative system for deliverance of justice. ""Eventually, it allows the state to behave in the spirit of live and let others live without making any body victor or loser,"" the Chief Justice said.

Chief justice of the Allahabad High Court Tarun Chatterjee said that for the huge pendency of cases in courts, the reluctance of the government to deal with its own men was no less responsible than other factors. He said that holding of lok adalats would help a great deal in deciding such cases, the majority of which could be settled by mere compromise.

Giving details about the increasing number of pending cases in courts, Justice Chatterjee said that the pending cases in courts went up by five times in the last 10 years but the maximum of such cases were instituted by the government.

Justice Brajesh Kumar said that with increasing workload on judges, the public courts had been invested with onerous responsibility of providing justice to the poor.

6,Overworked cops go easy on rule breakers,"HYDERABAD: A common sight in the city is the hapless police force mutely watching the rampant flouting of traffic norms. They can do nothing even when one of its men is assaulted by a group of goons.

One such incident happened on Thursday, where a traffic police constable at Alugadda Bavi junction, near Mettuguda, in Secunderabad was assaulted by four persons, who then disappeared into the thick of the traffic.

According to a senior police officer, the department spends almost 70 per cent of its duty hours in ''green corridor and bandobust'' duties, ensuring that no VIP -â€” either local of visiting -â€” faces any problem on the city roads.

""As a result, the average policeman is overworked and is under constant stress. Catching rule breakers is thus not high on their agenda,"" the officer explained.

The cops are under continuous pressure to ensure safety for the VIPs on the roads. Negligence in this case will mean facing the ire of their superiors, he added.

""We are under constant pressure to ensure that no traffic comes in the way of a ''green corridor'' (a police term for a traffic-free stretch of road for the VIPs to move on),"" he said. Nearly 50 per cent of the traffic police time now goes for forming green corridors and another 20 per cent or more for other bandobust duties.

The fact that the city traffic police wing is woefully short-staffed has further aggravated the problem. ""The wing now has 1,100 personnel.

What we need is at least double this strength,"" additional commissioner (traffic) D T Nayak said.

7,State govt to hold three-day 'swasthya mela',"PATNA: The state government will organise a three-day ""Pariwar Kalyan Evam Swasthya Mela"" in all the 40 parliamentary constituencies of Bihar at a cost of Rs 8 lakh each. It will be a part of the ""health awareness month"" being observed in the entire country from January 15 to February 15 by the Union health ministry.

The venue and dates of the health melas would be decided by the government in consultation with the local MPs, district magistrates (DMs) and the chief medical officer of the district concerned. The venue of the mela would be selected in a way so that it is held in the vicinity of a medical college/sadar hospital or a community health centre to provide facilities for ultrasound and pathological tests. The mela would lay special emphasis on saving the girl child.

Apart from physical check-ups, including eye and dental check-ups of all those reporting at the health melas, a health card would be given to each of them. The facilities for investigations like urine test, blood sugar test, ECG, sputum test, PAP smear test would be available at these melas. All referral cases would be registered with the name of the patients and the hospitals from where they had been referred to for further treatment.

The guidelines issued by the Union health ministry to all the states in this connection said that with the health melas organised across the country during 2000-01 proving to be a huge success, the Centre was flooded with requests from a large number of MPs, Union ministers and state governments to hold more such melas.

All such requests carried a sense of urgency prompting the Centre to organise health awareness month in the country from January 15 to February 15 and hold one health mela in all parliamentary constituencies, it said.

The services of an adequate number of medical specialists, including physicians, surgeons, gynaecologists, ENT and eye experts, would be available at each venue.

The state government on Saturday convened a meeting of civil surgeons at state health and family welfare institute, Sheikhpura, Patna, to discuss the organisation of health melas in all the parliamentary constituencies.

Addressing the civil surgeons, the additional health secretary, C K Anil, directed them to finalise the venue and dates of such melas in consultation with the local MP and the DM and inform the government about the same within three days. All the civil surgeons were given a copy of the guidelines issued by the Centre. Anil had sent a letter to all the DMs in this regard on January 13.

8,'Alliance with Cong against party ideology',"GUWAHATI: Nationalist Congress Party leader P A Sangma on Saturday hinted that a split was imminent in the party because its alignment with Congress has gone against the original issue involved in the formation of NCP and its ideology.

""I cannot be a party to the alignment with Congress as our NCP was formed on the basis of not allowing a person of foreign origin to be the Prime Minister of our country. Besides, it goes against our ideology of nationalism and patriotism,"" he said.

Sangma said, ""There will be an immediate split in the party if a show cause notice is issued to me or I am expelled from the party for speaking out against the alignment.""

How can Pawar go against it to join hands with Sonia Gandhi when it (the stand that a person of foreign origin cannot hold a constitutional post) is enshrined in the preamble and constitution of our party, he asked.

""My request to him is that he should leave NCP and join the Congress because he has set aside the issue of foreign origin,"" the former Speaker said.

9,Expedite labour and power reforms: FICCI to govt,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the general elections, apex industry chamber FICCI on Sunday warned polity against resorting to gimmicks at the cost of the economy with its new President Y K Modi urging the government to downsize, expedite labour and power sector reforms and disinvestment.

""Leave the gimmicks... There will be no political gains,"" Modi said, adding that even the political parties too had begun to realise that it was important to take long-term measures in the interest of people to form the government.

""More than caste and creed, issues of growth and employment had taken the front seat and were driving the vote banks,"" Modi told PTI in an exclusive interview.

Charting out a four-pronged vision for hastening growth, he said government should expedite labour reforms along with downsizing, power sector reforms and disinvestment while creating a seamless market in the country by removing all regional barriers.

Pressing for labour reforms, Modi said any delay on this account would ""inhibit employment.""

""They have to make businessmen interested in creating jobs,"" he said and added that global competitiveness and low cost were the only two keys to success.

Pointing at the high cost of power and finance in the country, he said banks should be told not to keep their money with government and devise an interest rate band for the industry including small entrepreneurs. ""Government exposure to banks should not be over and above SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio),"" he said.

10,Oppn questions Musharraf's election as president,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan''s mainstream Opposition parties which made a vain bid to stop Pervez Musharraf from addressing Parliament have said the president had violated the sanctity of the House as he had no legal right to address the joint session.

Speaking at a joint press conference after staging a protest during President Musharraf''s address on Saturday, Opposition leaders said the president recently amended the constitution go get his election through referendum as president ratified.

Leader of Awami National Party (ANP) Asfandyar Wali Khan warned that reaction against the passage of Musharraf''s constitutional amendment would be very severe which could even be detrimental to the solidarity of the federation.

He said his party did not accept Musharraf as an elected president since his election had not been held in accordance with the procedure laid down in the constitution, hence he had no legal right to address the joint session.

Cricketer-turned-politician, Imran Khan who headed the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf, said all those who wanted to see Pakistan adopt the democratic path should record their protest against the flagrant violation of the sanctity of parliament by the very people who kept claiming that they were trying to usher in ''genuine'' democracy.

""I was ashamed to see the elected Prime Minister Jamali twice going out of parliament to pay his respects to a General,"" he said.

Amin Fahim, chairman of the 15-party Alliance for Restoration Democracy (ARD), who lead the agitation against Musharraf said the Opposition would continue its struggle for the revival of democracy and restoration of 1973 constitution.

Fahim, a close associate of self exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said since day one, the Opposition had been of the view the constitution could not be amended by an individual and even the Supreme Court was not competent to grant such powers to an individual.

He said the government had got the 17th amendment passed under the umbrella of the army and the presidential election was in clear violation of the constitutional provisions. He claimed Musharraf''s address was made possible by keeping two important political leaders like Javed Hashmi and Asif Ali Zardari behind bars and by stopping a number of Opposition members from reaching parliament.

Speaking on the occasion, acting president of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Nisar Ali Khan said history had been made as a serving chief of army addressed an elected parliament.

By staging a protest during the joint session, the Opposition had made it clear that it would not allow the dictator a free hand, he said adding it was regrettable that the sanctity of the joint session was violated by holding it on a 24-hour notice, thereby keeping a good number of members away.

He said the joint session was held at a time when a large number of parliamentarians were abroad and to make sure that the protest would remain under control the government diverted a number of flights bringing Opposition members to the capital from Lahore and Karachi.

11,BJP to contest UP polls on its own,"BANGALORE: BJP President Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said the party would contest the coming Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh on its own ""as of now"" and did not see any possibility of an electoral tie-up with Samajwadi Party.

""I do not see any possibility of BJP and SP coming together. We will contest on our own in Uttar Pradesh. That is the situation as of now"", Naidu told reporters after the BJP Karnataka unit''s State Council meeting here.

Asked about moves to bring former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh back into the BJP fold, Naidu dismissed the query, saying ""we do not discuss about individuals"".

On alliance with Mayawati-led BSP, he said she was not with the BJP.

Regarding the talk about alliance between BJP and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, Naidu said there had been no discussion so far on the issue. ""I am neither proposing nor opposing (the alliance)"", he said in reply to a question.

He said there was still time to firm up alliances and added, ""we will discuss alliances at an appropriate time"".

To repeated questions on tie-up with Jayalalithaa, Naidu said ""I do not want to discuss about individuals and parties without formally discussing the issue in the party.""

Asked if the doors were still open for Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party to join NDA, he said ""whoever accepts Vajpayee''s leadership is welcome.""

Asked who would lead the Lok Sabha elections, pat came the reply: ""Vajpayee.""

Asked if he favoured a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam, he said the party favoured a CBI probe and wondered why the Congress governments were ""feeling shy"" of it.

""If CBI enquiry is not sufficient, then one can think about it.""

12,Border Wing jawan commits suicide,"AHMEDABAD: Mangal Singh, a Border Wing (BW) jawan posted in Nalia of the Kutch-Bhuj range, allegedly committed suicide on Sunday afternoon in the Sherkotda area.

Mangal was accompanied by another BW jawan, Roop Singh, when the incident took place. Roop was taken into custody by the Sherkotda police. However his statement could not be recorded as he was in an inebriated state when found at the site of incident.

The incident took place around 3.30 pm when the two BW jawans were walking by the tall boundary walls of Municipal Labour Quarters behind the Naroda Fire Station.

What exactly happened in a matter of minutes is however unclear as initially the police control room was informed by local residents that one jawan had shot the other. Senior police officials rushed to the spot and on conducting a detailed inspection concluded that it was a case of suicide.

Mangal had apparently placed the 303 rifle of his companion under his chin and fired a shot. The bullet had emerged from his temple, killing him almost instantly. Burn marks of the rifleâ€™s nozzle were clearly visible under his chin.

Police officials said that such burn marks take place only when the firearm is close to skin when the shot is fired. Five bullets, one empty bullet-shell were recovered from the spot. Four other bullets, from the stipulated pack of ten, however are missing. A team of FSL officials also soon reached the spot to investigate the incident.

A suicide note also have been recovered from the victimâ€™s shirt pocket. The note, said police, expressed guilt about some mishap (which has not been elaborated upon in the note). â€œThis suicide seems to be a fall out of a failed love affair,â€� said senior police officials who rushed to the spot after the incident.

The city police has intimated Mangalâ€™s seniors in his battalion and are also trying to track down his family members who stay in Kutch to verify the cause behind this suicide.

The role of Mangalâ€™s companion Roop also has come under scrutiny as the suicide victim was off-duty and on a personal visit to Ahmedabad. Reason for this visit, believe city police may be related to his love affair.

â€œHow did Mangal, an off-duty jawan, get hold of the service rifle? This he may have done by taking the 303 rifle from Roop Singh. We are investigating this aspect and soon as Mangalâ€™s companion returns to his senses we will grill him,â€� said an police official of Sherkotda police station.

13,Withdrawal of security cover to ministers demanded,"PATNA: The Bihar State Gazetted Officers Federation (BSGOF) leaders demanded withdrawal of security cover being provided to the ministers, IAS, IPS and top ranking officials as well as the legislatures in order to save a huge amount from the state exchequer being incurred on safety of these VIPs. They were talking to the newsmen here on Sunday.

They said that the ministers are Maharajas, the legislatures Rajas and the IAS-IPS officers are princes in the present dispensation. They said that state government all the time plead financial crunch when it comes to provide fund for giving central pay scale and other facilities for gazetted officers of the state but when it comes to meet expenses of extravagance of legislatures no such financial crunch comes in way. BSGOF leaders Dr Parmanand Pal, Ram Niwas Pandey, Ashok Moti, Banke Bihari Sao, Devanand Prasad Singh, Girishnandan Prasad Singh, Dr Dharmendra Sinha, Udit Narayan Singh, Aruna Sinha and Aditya Narayan Jha Anal were present in the press conference.

They said that gazetted officers are being denied central pay scale and their pay scales have rather been reduced. Since 1.1.96 all the gazetted officers of the state are working on lesser pay scales.

The gazetted officers of the state have been denied promotions as they have been denied benefits of promotion under assured career progression scheme. They said that age of superannuation for IAS-IPS officials and even the non-gazetted employees have been fixed 60 years whereas the gazetted officers have been denied.

They said that on the eve of elections the gazetted officers should also be given benefit of all the provisions which has so far been denied to them. They also demanded the gazetted officers are not able to function in atmosphere of prevailing lawlessness.

14,LS polls: BJP cannot afford to be complacent,"NEW DELHI: The BJP seems to have convinced itself that all is over with the coming Lok Sabha polls, but the celebration. Rushing the goal, as the BJP seems to be doing, is legitimate tactic, but as any footballer knows, it has the attendant risk of leaving one''s own goal untended.

The ''feel-good factor'' is the result of the party''s victory in three state assembly elections last December. But a quick look at assembly elections since 1999 shows little room for complacency. In the February 2000 assembly elections in Bihar, Orissa, Haryana and Manipur, the Congress got a battering. But the gainers were not BJP, but regional actors like Laloo Prasad Yadav, Naveen Patnaik and Om Prakash Chautala.

In the May 2001 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Assam and Pondi-cherry, the BJP was not in the reckoning.

Year 2002 was a mixed year for the party. In the elections in UP, Uttaranchal, Punjab and Manipur, the party got a drubbing. But subsequently, it did well in the Goa elections in May and swept the Gujarat poll in December through a hopefully one-off event. The J&K polls were a fiasco with the party''s confused politics resulting in a setback in the Jammu region.

The year 2003, too, was mixed. The BJP did poorly in the February elections and lost Himachal to the Congress. It was not a player in Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland. But later in the year, it managed to win three crucial elections in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

Looked at any way, the BJP''s problem as it goes into the 14th Lok Sabha elections can be summed up in two words: Uttar Pradesh. The state has 80 Lok Sabha seats of which the BJP won 29 the last time around. The outcome of the 2002 state assembly polls â€” 25 for Congress, 88 for BJP, 98 for BSP and 143 for SP â€” indicated that while the SP gained ground since the October 1999 LS elections, the BJP and BSP had just about retained their position while the Congress had lost ground. But none of them lost or gained enough to affect the gridlock on the states politics.

Through the prism of caste, it appeared that the BJP retained its hold on the upper castes, while the Yadav-Muslim combination worked for the SP. The BSP''s stronghold over the Jatav community, that constitutes 12 per cent of the state''s dalit population, remained unchanged.

To change things, the BJP needs an alliance. Despite a brief flirtation with the BSP, that does not seem to be happening. It therefore needs the support of at least some OBCs and dalits, but that seems a distant prospect as long as Kalyan Singh remains aloof.

An unknown factor has now been introduced â€” riots, encouraged not-so-tacitly by the BJP and the BSP against the decision to undo the formation of a number of new districts.

15,Five arrested for triple murder,"NEW DELHI: The south district police have arrested five people for their alleged involvement in a triple murder reported from Surajkund in Haryana. Three charred bodies were found in the area on January 8. The victims were residents of Gobindpuri.

According to the police, the accused had murdered the three men in a house in Tughlaqabad and later dumped their bodies in Surajkund. The police said that the killing was a result of strife between two groups of people over a 20-year-old woman, Rani, who is one of the accused.

""One of the accused, Deepak, was having an affair with Rani. He resented the fact that Jeetan, one of the victims, was also cosying up to her. He, therefore, arranged for Jeetan''s murder. Jeetan was killed alongwith his associates Devender and Ravinder,"" said DCP (south) Vivek Gogia. Deepak is absconding.

The officer said 11 people, including Rani, were involved in the killing. Rani has been arrested. ""The main accused Deepak and Mahesh are involved in another murder reported from Ambedkar Nagar. Mahesh has been arrested,"" added Gogia.

According to the police, seven of the 11 accused actively participated in the killing while four others helped them dispose of the bodies.

The bodies were allegedly dumped in gunny bags and carried to Surajkund in a Maruti car owned by Mahesh. The bodies were burnt.

The police said that a locally-made pistol and three knives were seized from the accused. ""They wanted to flee Delhi and were planning to rob a businessman when they were nabbed from Tughlaqabad. We hope to arrest the otheraccused soon,"" said Gogia.

16,Consumers' interest is our topmost priority: Yusuf,"NEW DELHI: Is there a solution to the problem of faulty billing and ''fast meters''? A few days into taking over the power portfolio, Delhi minister Haroon Yusuf has discovered that he must walk the tightrope carefully.

Though the government never tires of telling us that the power reforms and the privatisation process has won accolades from the Union government and the Central Vigilance Commission, there is also little doubt that consumer is far from being the king.

""We are aware of the problems faced by the consumers and their interest will be the topmost priority. The chief minister in fact is personally monitoring consumer redressal personally through a special consumer relations cell,"" Yusuf said.

The minister feels that efforts made by private power distribution companies should not be ignored. ""They have started special phone numbers, e-mail address and complaints on website for billing related problems. A consumer relations cell at the CEOs'' office of both BSES and NDPL has been set up,"" he explained.

DERC too has disposed off over 400 complaints regarding this issue, said Yusuf. ""As and when complaints are brought to our notice we will take note and inquire in to the matter,"" he added.
