0,POTO a draconian law: Congman,"kanpur: senior congress leader and aicc member kuldeep singh on tuesday said that the promulgation of the contentious prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) by the bjp-led government at the centre was a draconian measure aimed at gagging the voice of dissent — essential to a bubbling democracy like india — and muzzling the freedom of the press. singh said that the hurried manner in which the vajpayee government had rushed through the ordnance barely a month before the winter session of parliament had raised serious doubts about the very motive behind bringing in a reincarnation of tada in the form of poto. it confirmed beyond any doubt the fascist mind working overtime behind the vajpayee government to implement the communal agenda of the sangh parivar. the immediate aim of the parivar seemed to be to retain power in up by hook or crook. singh alleged that the hasty manner in which poto had come into effect, had also demolished the vajpayee government's oft-repeated belief in the politics of consensus.

12,Govt gives BJP talking points on terror law,"new delhi: bjp leaders were on tuesday given talking points by the government on the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), ahead of the party's proposed campaign in support of the new law. through the campaign, the bjp hopes to build up communal temperature and present parties such as the congress, the samajwadi party and the left as ''anti-national.'' at a two-hour briefing by home ministry officials, bjp president jana krishnamurthy, party general secretary sunil shastri and others were briefed on poto and why it was necessary at this point. the objective was to help them prepare propaganda material both for the bjp-sponsored countrywide anti-terrorism day on november 18 as well as the party's pro- poto campaign. besides the bjp, three other nda partners were invited to the briefing arranged by home minister advani in the home ministry: railway minister nitish kumar (samata party), minister of state for external affairs omar abdullah (national conference) and minister for power suresh prabhu (shiv sena). prabhu could not attend. other bjp ministers present were arun jaitley, arun shourie and ved prakash goyal. according to sources, other nda partners may be briefed later to prepare them for the expected opposition onslaught during parliament's winter session, opening on november 21. the reason being cited for all nda partners not being invited to tuesday's briefing was that the government did not want unwarranted attention to be drawn to the reservations about the poto nda partners like the dmk and the akali dal have already publicly expressed. meanwhile, controversy continued to rage within the bjp over whether advani had at the party national executive meeting in amritsar last week said, ''those who oppose poto are supporting terrorists''. in his press briefing, jaitley quoted advani as having said this, only to be contradicted the next day by krishanmurthy, who said the home minister would not use such strong language. later, krishnamurthy said he would check with advani. but on tuesday, despite meeting advani, krishnamurthy did not seek clarification and journalists were told he would do so at the next meeting. for record, advani's statement matched the strongly worded national executive resolution on terrorism.

13,Govt hopes law will get through RS,"new delhi: the chances of the prevention of terrorism ordinance getting past the rajya sabha hurdle have improved with indications that congress as well as several other parties are ''re-considering'' the ordinance, as they feel their opposition may be misconstrued as ''pro-terrorist'', home ministry officials say. the support extended to poto by aiadmk supremo j jayalalithaa on tuesday has provided much solace to the officials, who are monitoring the issue closely. having faced ltte terrorism in tamil nadu when she headed the government from 1991 to 1996, jayalalithaa said she fully endorsed the ''need for a stringent legislation to effectively put down terrorism''. this means the ruling nda is assured of six crucial aiadmk votes in the rajya sabha. ministry officials feel the congress, quite familiar with the compulsions of governance, has apparently started re-thinking after party president sonia gandhi found out that congress-ruled maharashtra and karnataka already have such stringent laws. besides, officials point out, it was during the congress rule at the centre that the lapsed tada was enacted.

""people in power have no idea of the difficulty we face. how do we transport gas supplies if cycles are not allowed? i have told the residents, you find a solution to this and i will deliver the cylinders. autos are already banned on brigade road."" also hit by the move are courier companies. nilgiri's, with a store on brigade road, is finding it difficult to get supplies from fruit shops. proprietor kumarvel said his store supplies 25,000 litres of milk a day to customers on cubbon road, mg road, ulsoor, fraser town, cox town, rest house road and surrounding areas.

15,"Keep distance from govt, RSS tells BJP","new delhi: ''if you don't want to go the congress way, keep a safe distance from the government,'' the rss has told the bjp. besides, highlighting the ''selfless nationalistic'' workers of the rss, the sangh has felt that if the reins of the bjp remain with such workers, the party as well as the government will run well. the advise and the observation has come from rss spokesperson m g vaidya, who has contributed an article in the weekly panchajanya. by implication, vaidya has charged the government with bulldozing the party into submission and that despite loaning rss cadre the bjp still does not have enough ''selfless'' workers and leaders. the prime minister on october 21 made a statement about a ''communication gap'' between the government and the bjp, but the breach was bridged soon after with a public denial. vaidya, however, has returned to the theme in his full-page article and elaborated on the subject of the ''party and the government'' in the latest issue of the panchajanya. according to the rss spokesman there ought to be a distance between the party and the government. he claims that all those parties, especially the congress, that did away with this ''distance'' between the government and the party had to pay dearly for making the party an extension counter of the government or the pmo. ''with our organisational experience, the rss believes that organisation is supreme, whether in power or not. the party workers cannot play second fiddle to the parliamentary party. and the party that wags its tail to please the government and hides it in fear when the government is displeased, is absolutely useless. indira gandhi has done this to the congress, i believe the bjp does not want to become so,'' vaidya writes.

18,"PASA for grabbers of govt land, warns Haren","gandhinagar: after cracking down on corrupt revenue officials, new revenue minister haren pandya on tuesday announced that the government plans to invoke prevention of anti social activities act (pasa) against those who use vacant government land for commercial purpose and running industries. speaking to mediapersons, pandya said this was for the first time that the government has decided to deal firmly against land grabbers. the district collectors have been directed to initiate action against land grabbers if they did not comply with the warnings by december 1. he said the anti-encroachment teams would remove illegal structures if those owning them did not remove them at their cost within the period of deadline. the department will issue public notice asking them to remove encroachments carried out without the required permission from concerned authorities. the government has also decided to video-record the existing vacant plots owned by the state so that revenue authorities could stop any encroachment on such plots. in case of land grabbing after videography, the government will take punitive action against concerned mamlatdar and circle revenue inspector. to begin with, the drive will be launched in six municipal corporations of ahmedabad, vadodara, surat, rajkot, jamnagar and bhavnagar and in the jurisdiction of urban development authorities of these cities and in limits of municipalities. in the second phase, action would be taken against those who have constructed illegal houses on government plots. he assured that even politicians if found involved in land grabbing activities would not be spared from the dragnet of law as in no circumstances government would tolerate such nefarious activities flourishing in a big way in the state. he said that so far pasa has been used sparingly against land grabbers but under the new dispensation headed by chief minister narendra modi, such elements would not get any political shelter. quoting the figures of land grabbing, the minister said that in 1996 only 17 people were booked under pasa out of a total 1065 detained under the deterrent act. while in 1997 out of the total arrest of 534, only one person was detained under pasa. in 1998, out of 844 detainees, 10 were arrested under pasa. in 1999 only 8 cases were registered out of 1141 and in 2000 two land grabbers were booked out of 234 persons arrested under pasa. in the current year, as many as 707 arrests have been made under pasa but no one has been booked for land grabbing. pandya said the government has, in order to further streamline revenue administration, created a special post of revenue inspection commissioner and appointed a senior ias official, chandrashekhar, for the new assignment. the teams from the commissionerate will carry out surprise raids in rural areas and supervise the functioning of the revenue staff.

20,CBI yet to arrest IAS officials in IPCL land scam,"ahmedabad: the central bureau of investigation (cbi) is yet to track down three persons including two senior retired officers of the india administrative service, in connection with the indian petrochemical corporation limited land scam, causing financial losses to the tune of rs 2 crore to the psu. the officers include the former chairman and managing director of the psu, k g ramanathan, the former director of finance of ipcl n chander and the former vice-chairman of gujarat industrial development corporation n m bijlani. according to the cbi, ramanathan in collusion with bijlani had cheated the ipcl by entering into a land purchase agreement with a private party and acquiring land for the psu at rates, more than 10 times the market value of the plot. ""when the market value of the land was rs 68,000 per acre, the cost paid by the psu per acre was rs 6.2 lakh,"" said a cbi official. according to the findings of the case, bijlani was a former ias officer of the 1963 batch in the gujarat cadre and had retired from the services around 1994. ramanathan (1962 batch ias), then chairman of ipcl, appointed him as a consultant with the ipcl. among other duties in his work profile, bijlani was also to look into the land purchases made by ipcl. ""the very appointment of bijlani was a doubtful exercise as it violated the required norms including the approval of the ipcl board,"" a cbi official maintained. furthermore, the conspiracy can be well established from the fact that despite being on the pay-rolls of ipcl, bijlani, the cbi maintained, received a kick-back of rs 16 lakh from the private broker, jayesh d panchal, who arranged for the 35 acres of land which ipcl purchased. the land was eventually purchased at vardala village, bharuch district under vagra taluka around 1999, for developing a township for the employees. the investigating agency have further alleged that whereas the ipcl, being a psu, could have approached the state for the purchase of land, ramanathan avoided the route so as to facilitate the conspiracy whereby the ipcl was subsequently cheated of a whopping amount. also there were irregularities while opening the tender floated for the purpose and panchal was given undue weightage and other bidders were not even called for negotiations. the conspiracy came to light when following tip-offs, the cbi approached the committee of the revenue department which decides on the market rates prevailing in a particular plot. the officials confirmed the actual rate of the plot at the relevant period of time of the purchase, which affirmed that the deal was actually struck at a exorbitant rate. the sanction for the deal and order for release of payment towards the deal was done by chander, the fourth accused in the case. though the investigations have been on since april this year, the first arrest was affected only on october 29, when panchal, the broker of the deal, was arrested and was remanded in cbi custody for interrogation till november 6. while the cbi maintained that the three ipcl officials would be arrested appropriately ""when the time is ripe"", it opposed the bail application sought by panchal, on the grounds that investigation was still on crucial stage. special judge b n jani, however, observing the gravity of the case and the fact that the release of the accused, an influential person, would hamper investigation, turned down the bail plea. the cbi told the court it would take a month more to conclude with detailed investigations.

21,"Forget downsizing, state govt is gathering more flab","gandhinagar: gujarat seems to have completely given up on downsizing the government, a pledge made initially about a decade back and reaffirmed by the bjp rulers when they came to power. if anything, the government is getting bloated with each passing day. an internal official note has found that the state government's plan to effect a 10 per cent cut in the state administration, initiated on october 28, 1991 has been ineffective even after a decade. it has also found that fresh plans drawn up by the bjp rulers to go in for further 10 per cent cuts on september 9, 1998, and finish with a 20 per cent cut in the state administration by march 31, 2000, is still on in the reverse direction, despite the expiry of the date 20 months ago. the note, which has been marked 'confidential', complains, ""things have not progressed as desired. difficulties in implementation are unsurmountable."" circulated for comments and discussed at several secretaries' meetings, held every tuesday, the note puts forward the findings of a committee headed by senior ias officer a w p david to point out that out of the 4,01,292 government jobs in 1991 for which details were obtained, in a decade only 32,153, or eight per cent jobs, have been abolished. ""several departments have not furnished full details"", the note says. today, the total number of government employees, including panchayats, are 4,68,034. this excludes employees working in state-owned corporations and grant-in-aid bodies. handed over to a senior asian development bank consultant recently to study the effectiveness of government plans to downsize the administration as part of the state's fiscal reforms, the data given in the note suggest that two years ago, the total government employees' strength was considerably less - 4,51,747 and the size of the administration had reached 4,67,976, as on march 31, 2000. of course, there was a slight deceleration in government employees working in line departments, from 2,45,780 two years ago to 2,44,387 today. but this is less than 0.6 per cent cut, a far dream from downsizing the administration as desired. as for the panchayat employees, the numbers have gone up from 2,05,967 to 2,23,674! not without reason, the total amount state spends on government, including panchayat employees, too, is up from rs 3,886.22 crore in 1999-2000 to rs 4,114.19 crore in 2000-01. giving separate details of 43 government-run boards and corporations, the note suggests that here also the cut in administration is meagre - from 1,51,121 employees in 1999 to 1,46,523 today. the cut is of merely 3.1 per cent, though here the plan, as worked out in september 1998, was to effect an extra 10 per cent cut by march 31, 2000. despite having frantically tried to obtain details, the david committee has failed to get any statistics on the number of employees cut in grant-in-aid institutions. the worst performance in effecting a cut in the employees' strength was that of the state home department. though the desired numbers to be cut in two years, as fixed in 1998, was 13,253, by 2001, a mere 2,128 were cut. many of them police constables. despite the cut, the total number of persons working in the home department has gone up from 79,226 in 1999 to 80,679 today. the best performance was that of the industries and mines department, which cut down 3,155 jobs instead of the desired 2,623. the employees' strength in several government boards and corporations, despite the official aim to withdraw from economic activity, has been going up. the gujarat state road transport corporation (st) strength is up from 59,839 in 1999 to 61,189 today; the gujarat electricity board strength is up from 50,402 to 51,003; and the sardar sarovar narmada nigam ltd strength is up from 9,131 to 9,247. on the other hand, some of them, such as the gujarat maritime board has brought down the strength from 3,414 to 3015; and gujarat mineral development corporation from 3,245 to 2,912.

22,Kalyan to go it alone in Assembly polls,"lucknow: ruling out poll alliance with any party for the coming assembly elections in uttar pradesh, rashtriya kranti party (rkp) president kalyan singh on wednesday said it would field candidates in all the 403 seats. exuding confidence that rkp ""is on a very strong footing with massive public support from all quarters,"" the former chief minister told reporters here that it could even emerge as the single largest party and play a decisive role in government formation. rejecting chief minister rajnath singh's claims of an undercurrent in favour of the bjp, singh said poll results would prove that ""the undercurrent is not in favour of bjp but against it. bjp will not sweep the polls but weep after it."" bjp had no concrete issue for the polls and hence was playing its old card of ""divide and rule"" by creating communal hatred, singh alleged, adding: ""ram mandir has been brought on the centrestage because all other issues like development and reservation have proved to be a non-starter."" bjp's decision to make terrorism an election issue would boomerang and the people would question it about the several ""wrong decisions"" taken by the government led by it while dealing with terrorist outfits in the recent past, he claimed. ""it has been proved beyond doubt that the government lacked the will to firmly deal with the menace of terrorism and its actions were confined to mere rhetorics,"" he alleged, adding ""even prime minister atal bihari vajpayee will not be able to win over the voters this time as people have come to know the real man behind his much hyped charisma and moral values."" referring to the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), kalyan singh said no ""draconian"" law was needed to deal with terrorists. ""poto is not in the interest of the people and democracy and it will lead to imposition of emergency type restrictions in the country,"" he warned. singh urged the government to forcefully put through country's viewpoint at the doha meet of the world trade organisation (wto) and ensure that the discriminatory provisions were withdrawn. on the state government's decision to raise the retirement age of government staff to 60 years, singh said it defeated the chief minister's promise to provide maximum employment to jobless youth.

25,Govt concedes more talks on terror law,"new delhi: the central government intends to bring the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance for enactment in parliament towards the end of the winter session. on the request of members from various political parties attending the consultative committee on the home ministry on wednesday, advani conceded yet another round of discussions on poto by the committee members in the first week of parliament's winter session. obviously, the government is keen on building consensus on the proposed law, which had provoked considerable passions. opposition members led by cpm mp somnath chatterjee had said that there were a lot of conflicting reports about the ordinance. he reportedly said it was being said that those opposing the ordinance were being described as ""supporters of terrorism"". several other members too wanted some clarifications. a senior congress member said it was decided that next cc will take up a substantial discussion on november 23. later, speaking to outstation journalists who have come to attend the editors conference on social sector being held here, advani asserted that what he had said at amritsar was that ""those opposing poto are wittingly or unwittingly making terrorists happy."" the dynamics of the world situation had been such after the september 11 terrorist attacks, ""terrorism could not be used as a state policy or for aggrandisement."" he then quickly clarified, ""this does not mean that our conflict with terrorism will end. but certainly state support to terrorism will not be easy."" recalling and praising security forces' experience in curbing terrorism in punjab, advani pointed out that he sometime ago had suggested that courts could sympathetically look at the charges of human rights violations faced by some security personnel while carrying out their bonafide duty. he pointed out that poto provided for protection to security personnel fighting against terrorists if their action was ""bonafide and carried out in good faith."" it provides that ""no suit, prosecution or other legal proceedings shall lie against the central government or a state government or any officer or authority on whom powers have been conferred under this ordinance, for anything which is in good faith done or purported to be done in pursuance of this ordinance.""

26,Advani rules out restoration of autonomy to J&K,"new delhi: union home minister l k advani on wednesday ruled out restoration of autonomy to jammu and kashmir and voiced concern over the recent influx of hindus from bangladesh. chairing a meeting of the consultative committee on home affairs here, advani said there was ""no question of setting the clock back"" in jammu and kashmir. he, however, said the centre was always prepared to consider further devolution of powers to the states in general, including jammu and kashmir. sharing members' concern over the recent influx of hindus from bangladesh after the new government assumed office there, he said the government was in close touch with west bengal and the north eastern states which are facing the brunt of the influx and was monitoring the situation. according to an official release, many members desired discussion on the recently-promulgated prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) before taking up the listed business. however, it was decided that the committee would discuss the ordinance at its next meeting scheduled on november 23. on the menace of terrorism afflicting the country, the home minister asserted that the country was capable of fighting it on its own strength and there was no question of seeking anybody's help in this regard. on the us associating pakistan in its fight against terrorism, advani said logically it may not be objectionable. but the world should realise that it is pakistan which is aiding and abetting terrorist activities in jammu and kashmir and of late in the hinterland through its intelligence agency isi, he said. the home minister said new delhi had been drawing attention of the developed nations towards the devastating repercussions of the growing menace of terrorism. but it was only after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us that the world felt its impact and what tragedy it brings to common man, he said. he said a notable success had been achieved in identifying and neutralising isi modules and terrorist networks not only in jammu and kashmir and north eastern states but also in the hinterland of the country. when some members raised raised the issue of doubtful activities of some madrassas in border areas of uttar pradesh, bihar and elsewhere, the general consensus was that madrassas as a whole should not be condemned and their activities be brought more into the mainstream. responding to a question regarding detention of police personnel for alleged violation of human rights while fighting terrorism, advani reiterated that such cases be considered for giving relief within the ambit of the constitution.
