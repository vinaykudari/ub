0,3 swindlers arrested,"PATIALA: The Patiala police claimed to have arrested three persons who were into swindling people impersonating themselves as CID inspectors.

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Bhupinder Singh, deputy superintendent of police (rural) disclosed that the arrested persons had been identified as Tejinder Pal Singh of village Cheema in Dharamkot police station of Moga district, Balwinder Singh of Gholia village under Bagha Purana police station and Surinder Singh of Hira Mahal Colony, Nabha.

Bhupinder Singh further disclosed that they had been arrested on the complaint of Karaj Singh of village Alipur near here. According to him, the accused went to Karaj Singh''s house and introduced themselves as inspectors from the CID Department, Chandigarh, and told him that they had come to enquire about the documents of his wife who is working as teacher in a private school on the basis of fake documents.

The DSP disclosed that in the presence of village Sarpanch and others, they recorded their statements and later to hush up the case, they demanded an amount of Rs 10000 from them. Karaj Singh gave them Rs 10000 on the spot and they asked them to give at least Rs 4000 more immediately for which they asked him to meet them in the mini secretariat of Patiala as they wanted to show them that they really belonged to the CID Department. He said that they asked Karaj Singh to pay the remaining amount soon in Gurudwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib.

Meanwhile, the police came to know about their activities and laid a trap. When they came to collect the remaining amount, the police nabbed them, he added.

Bhupinder Singh said with the same modus operandi they also swindled lakhs of rupees from many other persons.

Giving details, he said that during interrogations, they confessed that they swindled Rs 10000 from Chamkaur Singh of village Saida Singh Wala and Rs 10000 from his opponent Jaswinder Singh of Rangowal village in Moga in connection with a case going on between both the parties. Besides, they also swindled Rs 15000 of Nachchatar Singh of village Sekhwaan in Ferozepur district, Rs 9000 from Jassa Singh of Lopoke, and Rs 12000 from Dr Sania Nursing Home, Dharamkot threatening them that if they did not pay the money he would publish a news against him in a Punjabi daily.

DSP Bhupinder Singh further disclosed that Tajinder Pal Singh is running an organisation Lok Sewa Society in Moga district as chairman while Balwinder Singh was the vice chairman of this society.

Tajinder Pal Singh was also holding a press identity card of a Jallandhar-based newspaper. On the basis of this card, he also allegedly collected an amount of more than Rs 1.5 lakh in the name of advertisements which were never published in the newspaper.

1,"No election date yet, says BJP","NEW DELHI: BJP leaders are publicly denying that a final decision has been taken on the dates of the general elections, stressing that it is only after the NDA partners have been consulted and the partyâ€™s national executive approves it â€” when it meets in Hyderabad later this week â€” that it can be made official.

But the partyâ€™s newest member, MoS for social welfare Nagmani who merged his Shoshit Kranti Dal with the BJP on Monday at a personal show of strength here, said it for the party: â€˜â€˜ I had planned to join the party at a gathering of a few lakhs at the Ramlila Grounds. But on January 1, Venkaiahji (BJP chief) called me to say that the general elections were being advanced and so there was no time to lose. I must join the BJP on January 5.â€™â€™

Indeed, Naidu and his BJP colleagues were not just outnumbered by Nagmaniâ€™s friends but overwhelmed at the gathering at the Vithalbhai Patel House where he claimed that he controlled â€˜â€˜9 per cent of the vote across 10 statesâ€™â€™ in a speech that never seemed to end.
