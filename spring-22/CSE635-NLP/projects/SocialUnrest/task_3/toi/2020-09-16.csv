0,Protest against communal violence,"VADODARA: Businessmen and professionals in Godhra have started protesting against communal violence saying the little town''s economy can no longer afford to remain closed even for a day.

At a peace meeting organised by NGOs recently they said the town loses at least Rs 60 lakh within 24 hours each time there is communal violence and the market remains closed. They also insist this is a conservative estimate and that the number may be much higher.

Leaders of various communities hope to bring some peace to this trouble-torn town by showing the people how they are losing out both economically and socially. ""We charge just 70 paise as fees for Rs 1,000 worth of business that wholesale food grains dealers do,"" says president of Godhra''s Agriculture Produce Market Committee APMC) Prakash Barot. ""And yet at the end of last year we collected Rs 84 lakh. This goes to show the turnover of business in this little town of barely four lakh people.""

Barot, one of the speakers at the peace meeting, added that because Godhra is the main town in the Panchmahals district, traders from Lunawada to Halol come there to buy and sell their wares. ""When you calculate the loses that these people make, Rs 60 lakh does seem conservative.""

Nimesh Shah, another businessman, added, ""We found out the total income tax and sales tax collected from the town every year, found out the average and arrived at the figure of Rs 60 lakh,"" he says. ""It is time that people realise the kind of adverse impact that violence can have on the town, economically and socially.""

The loss can also be calculated from the number of people who chose not to come to Godhra immediately after the riots. ""Our figures show that within five days 800 railway cancellations were made as people feared more violence. If we don''t want to give an impression that Godhra is a fearful place then we have to bring peace.""

Among the NGOs involved in the peace meeting were Aman Samuday of Action Aid, Anandi, Humanist Rationalist Association and a host of local bodies like the Lions Club and the Rotary Club. ""About 200 people fasted and organised a Satyagraha at Patel Wada, close to what is seen as a sensitive area of the city on September 11,"" says VCHS Bahadur, programme co-ordinator for Action Aid at Godhra.

""Prominent personalities from the town gave speeches emphasising the importance of restoring normalcy. Most of them were professionals like doctors and lawyers.

Over 1,000 people from the town visited the function."" The NGOs will organise a rally and plays on September 26 to send across their message.

Godhra loses Rs 60 lakh a day during violence â€˜Peopleâ€™s initiative must for peaceâ€™ â€œWe will make all efforts to ensure that law and order is maintained in the town, but there has to be some initiative from the people as well,â€� said Panchmahals collector Manoj Agarwal who was present at the meeting along with Panchmahals DSP Manoj Antani.

â€œPeace would be more lasting if people find ways of maintaining order. I would also like to see more such initiatives from the people.â€�

1,"A setback to disinvestment, says India Inc","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court''s decision to halt the disinvestment in HPCL and BPCL is a big setback to the privatisation process, according to corporate India.

â€˜â€˜The implications at the first glance clearly signals a delay in the process of privatisation,â€™â€™ said Tarun Das, director general, CII. â€˜â€˜Privatisation is very important for furthering economic reforms and achieve higher growth. This will impact investment sentiment which was improving.â€™â€™

Das said disinvestment would make PSUs viable. â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s just a technical blip. The government seems committed to taking forward the disinvestment exercise and they will be able to get the political consensus in Parliament for the same,â€™â€™ said Subodh Bhargava, chairman, Wartsila.

Ficci has urged the government for early completion of legislative process towards disinvestment of HPCL and BPCL. But many believed that it may be hard to win parliamentary approval ahead of national elections due early next year.

â€˜â€˜The impact is not positive. The government could appeal to a bigger bench or issue an ordinance,â€™â€™ said Y K Modi, senior vice president, Ficci.

Assocham said that since the government has just begun with the process of disinvestment these problems must be visualised. â€˜â€˜The government has the duty to create consensus among political parties and get such a legislation passed.â€™â€™

5,Students' rally at Pbi varsity foiled,"PATIALA: The gate rally of Punjabi University Students Confederation (PUSC) was foiled due to the large presence of police on Punjabi University campus on Tuesday.

Check points had also been set up along the road to the university to prevent the rally which was to be held against the suspension of student leaders.

Swarnjit Singh Daleo, spokesman of PUSC, said that they had rejected the agreement offered by Punjab Vidhan Sabha deputy speaker Bir Devinder Singh.

He said that the students would continue their agitation seeking rollback of increase in the fees.

He said that the attitude of the police made it clear that the government was supporting the V-C and was not interested in addressing grievances of the students.

The university, however, remained open on Tuesday and students were allowed to enter the campus on the production of identity cards.

An anti-riot vehicle, a water canon, three ambulances, three fire brigades and more than 500 constables were stationed at the gate of the university.

Sources said that the police force had been summoned from six districts to prevent the rally.

Some students, who managed to reach the main gate, were arrested as soon as they started raising slogans.

An official spokesman said on Tuesday that 195 persons including 25 students who had been rounded up by the police were released in the evening.

The student leaders rounded up by the police included Surinder Singh Ghuman (president, Punjab Vidiarthi Jathebandi), Harmandeep Singh Gill (president, Students Federation of Indian, Punjab), Kiran Preet Singh Grewal (president, All India Democratic Students Organisation), Rajinder Singh (SFI) and three girls â€” Aman, Pawan and Prabhjot.

The activists of Bharatiya Kisan Union and other like-minded organisations blocked traffic at Ganda Kheri, Nabha road and Passiana.

6,Gender sensitive laws need of the hour,"LUCKNOW: Feminist organisations do not want common civil code in the country. Instead they advocate gender sensitive laws which can ensure protection of womenâ€™s rights in every caste and community and at the same time keep intact the pluralistic culture of the society. There is also a strong opinion in favour of having a â€˜quota within quotaâ€™ system in the proposed 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and state legislatures.

A simple reservation policy will only allow women of upper caste and upper class to reach the corridors of power, while those who were really downtrodden and suppressed may be left behind.

These were some issues debated during a day-long workshop on â€˜Gender, caste and communityâ€™, organised by the Institute of Womenâ€™s Studies, Lucknow University, on Tuesday. Nivedita Menon, political science department, Delhi University, in her lecture on common civil code said that an attempt to bring â€˜uniformityâ€™ in the civil codes of all the communities would deprive them of their originality and cultural exclusivity. She said there was also a threat of a common code going against the women as it happened after the enactment of Hindu Code.

She said the Hindu code only identified the â€˜saptpadiâ€™ system, prevalent in North India, as a proper system of marriage, whereas there were many communities all over India in Hindus which have different practices for marriage. At times, men use this clause to save themselves from charges of bigamy as marriage other than â€˜saptpadiâ€™ process was not recognised as â€˜official marriageâ€™, she remarked. She said that provisions for succession rights, guardianship of the child among other things in the Act were heavily tilted towards men and had patriarchal colour.

Mary John of department of women studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, while speaking on the topic of reservation said that besides their general problems, women were also facing different kinds of discriminations and suppression in every caste and community. Thus, only when women from every community and class get representation in politics, their problems would be highlighted in a proper manner. Former LU vice-chancellor and director, Institute of Women Studies, Prof RR Verma said that every religion, caste and class had gender discriminatory practices and women were being suppressed every where. Gender sensitive laws were the only solutions, she added.

The sessions were followed by interactive sessions with students.

8,CAs protest against I-T team,"LUCKNOW: A team of income-tax (I-T) officials from New Delhi on Tuesday morning went to the office of a city based chartered accountant (CA) in the Prince Complex in connection with some investigations related to a case of income-tax evasion.

9,11 arrested for killing constable,"HYDERABAD: The city police on Monday arrested 11 persons for the murder of a police constable.

It may be recalled that Mohammed Wahed Khan, a police constable working with the Prohibition and Excise State Task Force, was found murdered in a nala at Shivlalnagar in Dhoolpet on September 8.

The case was handed over to the Central Crime Station. Investigations by the police revealed that the constable was done to death by a gang of illicit liquor brewers headed by Papalal and Raju Singh.

The constable, active in gathering intelligence, was instrumental in extensive raids on the illicit liquor-brewing dens in Dhoolpet during August and September. These raids not only caused heavy losses to these brewers, but they were arrested and sent to jail, following which the gang decided to eliminate the constable.

The gang lay in wait for the right opportunity and it came on the night of September 4. Unaware of the threat to his life, Wahed Khan reached Dhoolpet alone at around 11 pm to collect information about illicit liquor dens.

Papalal and Raju Singh, along with nine others pounced on the constable, thrashed him with sticks and strangled him to death. The body was then dumped in the nala, and it was discovered by police only on September 8.

The nine other persons arrested have been identified as Subhash Singh, Vijay Singh, Manmohan Singh, Kummu Gunna Rao, Dinesh Singh Hazari, Shanker Singh, Mukhesh Singh, Jai Singh and Anil Singh â€” all residents of Dhoolpet.

11,Geete's visit a political one: Minister,"PATNA: ""Union energy minister Anant G Geete has turned his visit to Bihar into a political journey instead of making it a journey for development of a backward region"", said state''s junior energy minister Shyam Rajak.

In a statement to the press here on Tuesday, Rajak said Geete has targetted Bihar in his speech instead of announcing some concrete proposals in the power sector.

Rajak said Geete''s statement that the Centre was providing Rs 16,000 crore assistance to Bihar would have been justified, had this amount been made available for the renovation and modernisation of Muzaffarpur and Barauni thermal power stations.

This amount would be invested in setting up NTPC''s thermal power plant which would be sold to Bihar at the rate fixed by the Union government, he said.

Rajak also expressed serious doubts over the Centre''s policy to encourage private sector participation in setting up power utilities in the country. ""We have already witnessed the fiasco of Enron"", he said.

12,RBI rules out polls in 3 co-op. banks,"PUNE: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has refused to allow elections to the boards of directors of the city-based Rupee, Sadguru Jungli Maharaj and Suvarnayug co-operative banks,which are currently under the rule of administrators.

The recommendation made by the state department of co-operation, to allow elections in the three banks, has been rejected by the RBI,which has clarified that elections cannot be held till March 31, 2004. The co-operation department had also recommended elections in the Pavna co-operative bank, the board of directors of which was superseded for its role in the securities scam.

However, the RBI has not taken any decision regarding the same.

According to official sources, the department did not recommend elections in Citizens and Agrasen co-operative banks as the boards of directors were found guilty of various irregularities.

The boards of directors of Rupee, Jungli Maharaj and Suvarnayug co-op banks were superseded one-and-a-half years ago. While the Rupee bank faced action for financial irregularities, the Jungli Maharaj and Suvarnayug banks were found involved in securities scam.

Sources said the Jungli Maharaj bank suffered a loss of Rs 45 crore in the securities scam, but the bank seems to have recovered from the setback.Deposits,which had gone down from Rs 273 crore to Rs 239 crore after supersession, have increased again and touched the Rs 275-crore mark.

The bank administrator has succeeded in reducing the administrative expenses by Rs 30 lakh and the loss has subsequently reduced from Rs 44 crore to Rs 25 crore. The Suvarnayug bank has posted a profit of Rs 9 crore after making up the loss of Rs 5.65 crore. The deposit base has gone up to Rs 206 crore.

Sources said the co-operation department made periodic recommendations of holding elections in banks, under administrators, after taking a review of their performance. However, it was up to the RBI to decide whether to allow elections or not, they clarified.

13,Swiss people petition for self-rule in Tibet,"DHARAMSALA: The Tibet Support Groups in the small country in Alps, Switzerland, have submitted a petition to the Swiss Government and its Parliament on Tuesday, signed by more than 23,000 people from cross sections of the country. The petition appeals for a stronger support from the Swiss government to ensure self-rule for the Tibetan people.

The appeal also seeks Switzerland to launch a UN resolution on Tibet. The people of Switzerland want Swiss government to make Tibet an issue in all official contacts of their government with China.

Appeal is also being made to extend recognition to the Dharamsala -- based Tibetan administration headed by the Dalai Lama if there was no ''realistic'' progress in the relations between Beijing and Dharamsala in the next three years.

The petition appeals to the Swiss government to provide the Dalai Lama with official reception during his visit to the country in future.

Around fifty Tibetans and Tibet supporters handed over the petition to the Swiss government and the Parliament.

Switzerland, which houses the headquarters of the United Nations'' Human Rights Commission, is better known among the Tibetans for being one of the first countries besides India, to have resettled many Tibetan refugees in its territory.

14,"JD(S), Cong workers clash","KRISHNARAJNAGAR: Surprise was in store for state Lok Ayukta Venkatachala who visited the taluk government hospital here as a part of his week-long tour of offices and hospitals in Mysore district.

He was witness to a quarrel between the Congress and rival Janata Dal (S) workers with the former defending the doctors at the hospital and the latter accusing the hospital staff of indulging in corrupt practices.

At last it was Lok Ayukta himself who was forced to intervene and pacify the quarreling politicians.

As soon as Venkatachala arrived and announced his intention of inspecting the hospital, a local JD(S) leader and municipality member Jagadish started listing out the corrupt practices of the hospital staff, including the doctors. He alleged that all the doctors here in this hospital are running parallel clinics in town and accepting money from the patients.

At this stage, Congress workers who had also gathered in good numbers started shouting at the JD(S) member and tried to depict a rosy picture of the hospital.

""What all JD(S) leaders are speaking is bogus and every thing is fine and tidy here in this hospital,"" Congress workers were heard saying to the Lok Ayukta. But JD(S) workers insisted Venkatachala accept their complaints.

At this juncture irked Congress workers started shouting slogans in favour of a doctor and the JD(S) leaders retaliated.

However Lok Ayukta himself, Deputy Commissioner Kumar Naik and Mysore S P Shivakumar intervened and pacified the rival workers before going ahead with their inspection.

Later when Lok Ayukta entered the hospital, complaints against the doctors and hospital staff were in galore.

Patients and their attendants complained that despite huge stocks, hospital doctors forced the patients to buy medicines and dextrose bottles from outside. This allegation proved to be right when the Lok Ayukta forced open the doors of hospital store room.

Hundreds of bottles of dextrose were lying idle in the store room. Upset over the happenings, the Lok Ayukta warned the doctors of stringent action if they failed to work honestly.

The Lok Ayukta, irked over the garbage dump inside the hospital compound, directed the doctors to get the garbage cleared immediately before he goes out of the hospital.

16,'Society too responsible for suicides',"BANGALORE: A round table meeting organised in the city to debate the spate of farmers'' suicides evolved a charter of 15 recommendations while pinning the blame on the society.

Speaking at the meeting organised by the Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha, JD (S) leader P G R Sindhia said: ``Even in agriculturally prosperous states like Punjab, there have been suicides. But in Karnataka, the number has been rising over the last four years. The government''s shortsighted policies are directly responsible for this. All of us are to blame too, since nobody has responded to the problem with the seriousness it deserves.""

He also criticised officials who stated the farmers were committing suicides because of the Rs 1 lakh compensation promised by the government. ""Not only is this irresponsible, but downright callous as well,"" he stated.

Former Assembly Speaker Ramesh Kumar blamed politicians for the state of affairs and regretted that all policies were formulated by people who were least affected by them.

""Instead of fixing a support price for produce, the government should provide the farmer with enough purchasing power for his livelihood. This might probably solve some of the problems,"" he said.

Former UAS Vice-Chancellor Devaraj felt the need for creating awareness among young farmers on issues such as thrift and responsibility.

Representatives from the Dalit Sangharsha Samiti pointed out the necessity for formulating plans for optimum utilisation of resources and the need for convincing farmers to take up alternative means of livelihood along with farming.

Others who spoke included litterateur Chandrashekar Patil, theatre personality C G Krishnamurthy, representatives from the Left parties, farmers'' organisations, academicians and activists.

The charter of recommendations include waiver of all loans obtained by poor farmers, interest waiver on all loans and reduction of interest rate on future loans and strengthening of the cooperative sector.

20,UDF members criticising govt: Veerendrakumar,"KOCHI: JD(S) Kerala unit President M P Veerendrakumar on Wednesday said more than the Opposition, those in the Congress-led UDF were themselves vociferously criticising and trying to malign the government.

Speaking at a news meet here, Veerendrakumar said it was natural for the Opposition to criticise the government. But, the UDF was finding itself in an unpleasant situation with differing voices emanating from within the front itself on various issues.

Citing examples, he said while the Opposition parties were raising a hue and cry over the state tourism minister, K V Thomas, handing over a gift to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, UDF ministers were unhesitatingly airing their views on the issue, much to the embarrassment of the government.

While Industries Minister P K Kunhalikutty had stated that the government had not directed Thomas to hand over the gift, health minister P Shankaran had sought his Cabinet colleague''s resignation.

On the Marad issue, he said the government decision to complete rehabilitation of those who had fled the region by October 2 had drawn flak from senior Congress leader K Karunakaran, who has described it as ''eyewash'' and an ''election stunt''.

The JD(S) leader said his party and the LDF will support the rehabilitation effort and it should not be viewed as a political problem but a social one.
