0,Lucknow farmers headed for a strawberry affair,"LUCKNOW: From the delectable Dusseheries to exotic strawberries, it seems like the beginning of another love affair for farmers of Lucknow, who have long been wedded to mangoes. At least three hundred farmers from this traditional mango belt, are set to embark on a strawberry cultivation spree.

Facilitating the ""Himalayan invasion"" in the very heart of the Awadh, is the UP Diversified Agriculture Support Project (UPDASP), a government agency working in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Labelling this development as a mere attempt at a ''revival'', Ashok Agrawal, city horticulturist and the resource person for the project, who has a strawberry farm in Itonja, says the city boasts of a historical association with strawberry farming. An entry made in the Lucknow gazette of 1918 states: ""The best strawberries in the world are produced in Lucknow,"" he quotes, adding that he found it hard to believe this till he saw the document for himself.

His experiment, which began three years back has yielded encouraging results. Agrawal now finds it an extremely lucrative venture, and his success has prompted UPDASP to promote strawberry cultivation on a larger scale among the farmers here. So far, the agency has successfully implemented the project in Western UP â€” specially Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Hathras and Jhansi. ""This is the first time we have shifted base to the eastern belt,"" said Alok Gupta, district coordinator, Lucknow.

Although there have been a few stray flirtations with strawberry cultivation by farmers in and around Lucknow, Agrawal was the first to cultivate strawberries on a commercially viable scale in Barabanki. He will now begin his training and contact course for batches of fifty farmers each, beginning this fortnight.

Won''t the hot and dry climate of the city wreak havoc in the quality of the Himalayan beauties? Gupta is positive that it will not affect the crop in any such way. ""Contrary to the general impression, it is a very sturdy plant and is known to survive against all odds,"" he said. Himachal Pradesh is best suited to the cultivation of strawberries, but with technical know-how and a little caution, farmers here can also expect a good crop, he adds.

The only trick lies in the regular watering of plants -slips or runners as they are technically known as. While high density polythene pipes with small holes punched in it to allow jets of water to stream out, are best suited to the purpose.

The UPDASP is currently examining the more viable desi options as a replacement for this, and as Gupta himself pointed out: ""The purpose is to keep the soil moist all the time.""

Planting begins in October and the plant begins to bear fruit by February even as the season lasts till as late as early May. If the trainee farmers are successful, strawberries selling at Rs 200 a kg would thankfully be a distant nightmare for Lucknowites.

1,"Stop blaming previous govt, act: Hanspal","PATIALA: ""How long can we blame the previous government for the deteriorating condition of the state? We are in power for the last more than one year. Now, it is our responsibility to do something for the people of Punjab, to whom we are delivering the same old statements. Remember, after five years they will not vote us to power again if we do not try to solve their problems,"" said Punjab Congress president HS Hanspal, while speaking at an informal function at the office of the Punjab language department.

Hanspal said he did not mind that the MLAs had increased their salaries, but they should not escape from their duties. â€˜â€˜People would not spare those who ignore their problems,â€™â€™ he said. â€˜â€˜Finance minister Lal Singh had said that as against an earning of 100 paise, the government was spending 136 paise on the salaries and pension of employees, but people are only concerned about their problems, which we have to solve. It is the government which has to decide how to generate funds for the development of the state,â€™â€™ said Hanspal.

Denying that he was speaking the language of dissidents, Hanspal told mediapersons that he shared very cordial relations with chief minister Amarinder Singh and their coordination was an example throughout the country. He said he was fully satisfied with Amarinderâ€™s working, these were the ground realities which should be keep in mind.

The Punjab Congress president said that the history of the country should be rewritten without any further delay. â€˜â€˜Our history was written by the British, who recorded that the 1857 uprising was a mutiny, while for us it was war of freedom. How shameful is that our children are being taught in schools that it was mutiny,â€™â€™ he said.

Hanspal said the language department should be closed down as it had not published any books for the last three years, which was its prime job.

2,RJD gears up for April 30 rally,"PATNA: Amidst growing criticism about the massive funds being collected for the proposed â€œMaharallyâ€� on April 30, the RJD said â€œa little over Rs 15 lakhâ€� was needed for holding the mega event.

RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav quoted the figure when he asked party MLAs and MPs to pay their dues to the party as the money was needed for holding the rally. He was addressing party MLAs and ministers at the state party office on Wednesday. â€œThe MPs and MLAs owe the party about Rs 3 lakh. They should pay immediately because the party needs the money for holding the rally.

He pointed out that the arrangements for accommodation, food and entertainment for the participants of the Maharally will be made by the ministers, MLAs and MPs.

3,Vinayan assails US policy,"JEHANABAD: Noted social thinker Dr Vinayan on Wednesday called for formation of a strong confederation of nations, comprising China, Japan, Russia and India, to prevent the American juggernaut from dictating the world as the solo power in the wake of its success in Iraq war.

Delivering the key note address at a seminar on ""American invasion of Iraq and the American world-order"" oganised by the Jan Mukti Andolan here, Vinayan said that the Iraq war was less about weapons of mass destruction and more about oil.

""It is not just oil either. It is all about establishing total dominance over the world and its national resources,"" he said.

He said that the US invasion of Iraq not only lacks justification but is vulgar and vicious to the extreme.

Even as a form of anticipatory self-defence, Bush administration''s arguments in favour of the war on Iraq do not hold true.

""As for weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear and chemical arsenals, it is the US which is the biggest repository of such weapons. This is evident from the fact that it was America which first dropped atom bombs on Japan and used chemical weapons in Vietnam,"" he said.

Vinayan said that taking hindsight at America''s imperial depredations since 1950 and at the events in Korea, Vietnam, Central and South America, the Middle East and now Iraq, people are confronted with a terrifying legacy.

Admitting that America''s strength today is unmatched end no single country is in a position to pick up the gauntlet, he suggested formation of confederation of strong nations to counter the American menace which has overreached the limits of its power.

He said that people now realise the US gameplan.

America''s ambition has, at the same time, sown the seeds of resistance around the world and the US is not likely to enjoy the same unilaterist hegemony for too long, he observed. Shiv Bachan Singh Sanyasi presided over the deliberations.

Hari Lal Prasad Yadav, the convener of the seminar, proposed a vote of thanks.

4,"Tyagi was victim of vendetta, claims lawyer","MUMBAI: Discharging R.D. Tyagi and eight others in the Suleman Bakery case of 1993 on Wednesday, a sessions judge said the Srikrishna Commission report was inadmissible as evidence.

The prosecution had relied heavily on the report, which had indicted Mr Tyagi and the other policemen.

Earlier, Mr Tyagi''s counsel Srikant Shivade had argued that the supreme court had refused to read the Thakker Commission report in the Indira Gandhi murder case on the grounds that it was only an opinion and was meant for recommendation rather than evidence.

Arguing for Mr Tyagi''s discharge, Mr Shivade said his client was being ""frivolously prosecuted"" after a lapse of nine years and that the accusation against him stemmed from ""political vendetta"".

He said the FIR against Mr Tyagi was ""false and vindictive"" and that it was bound to send a wrong signal to the entire law and order maintenance machinery. It would deter officers from taking immediate action during law and order situations, he said.

He said Mr Tyagi had acted in accordance with the government''s own April 1986 guidelines on dealing with communal disturbances, asking police officers to deal firmly with communally tense situations in their initial stage.

He also said that Mr Tyagi and his team had not entered the bakery on their own but had gone inside in response to a wireless call received from the control room.

Judge Bavkar heard the recording of the wireless message in court.Mr Tyagi''s lawyer argued that the transcripts relied on by the prosecution were faulty.

He said Mr Tyagi, before directing his men to enter the bakery and arrest the arms-wielding miscreants from its rooftop, had taken various precautions and asked his men to use minimum force.

5,Rajnath opposed to politics of vendetta,"LUCKNOW: ""The government needs to work with restrain in UP,"" says former chief minister and national general secretary of BJP, Rajnath Singh, while expressing his opposition to the ""politics of vendetta"" in the state. He said: ""I am not afraid to face any inquiry, if the government thinks it so.""

Earlier, echoing similar opinion, state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar said that he would speak on this issue with chief minister Mayawati and added that personally he was not happy with her decisions to lodge FIRs for the alleged misuse of the discretionary fund. The action should rather be taken against district magistrates, who were actually the custodians of the government money.

As for a probe by the CM against senior Congress leader Motilal Vora, who was alleged to have distributed Rs 18 crore from the discretionary fund in eight months during his tenure as governor under the Presidentâ€™s rule in the state, Rajnath Singh said: â€œTo the best of my knowledge, it is against ethics and also against the business rules for a CM to do so.â€�

â€œPolitics of revenge has no place in democracy and, therefore, I see no justification for the governmentâ€™s decision to hold probe against former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav for his way of handling the discretionary fund,â€� Singh said.

Such an act was no less provocative than that of June 1995 incident of the state guest house in which chief minister Mayawati was subjected to an unwarranted hostility, he said adding that the incident, by all means, was a bad chapter in the state politics.

â€œI am afraid people will lose all faith in politicians, who are already pitiably placed in society and the politics of mud-slinging will give way to social conflict in the state,â€� he cautioned.

With regard to the future of the coalition government headed by Mayawati in the state, he said it would complete its full tenure. On the other hand, he said, the BJP was gearing up itself for the Lok Sabha polls. He said the party would reap a rich harvest of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpyeeâ€™s achievements, which he described as a milestone in the history of the country.

Describing US invasion of Iraq, he said it was indicative of the unipolar world in which America had grown stronger than ever after the collapse of the Soviet Union from the world scene. America, he said, had become imperialistic and this would pave the way for the third world war.

As for Indiaâ€™s position, he said the country needed to play a vital role in the emerging world scenario. But the cause of worry was the absence of national consensus among political parties on national issues and this, he said, could be forged by developing a concept of national government with adequate participation to all allies of the main political parties. The path for this had already been shown by the PM for this, who had been able to integrate the regional parties into the national mainstream, he added.

6,Mulayam violated all rules: Mayawati,"LUCKNOW: On the controversy of misuse of discretionary fund in the past, chief minister minister Mayawati on Wednesday reiterated that Mulayam Singh Yadav had violated the rules laid down for the disbursement of funds and given away more than one lakh in almost 600 cases. Reacting to the statements made by various leaders in this regard, the chief minister said that almost 350 cases were investigated which showed that the fund was misused in 180 cases. After this detection, the decision was taken to lodge FIRs, the chief minister said . Mayawati said that chief ministers were authorised to sanction a grant up to Rs 20,000. The funds could be given to people who suffered natural calamities, like fire accident, landslide and heavy snowfall when half of the amount of the loss could be given, said the CM's statement. It may be mentioned here that the ceiling on disbursement of funds was raised later. On the reaction of Motilal Vora, the then governor of Uttar Pradesh, regarding the discretionary fund distribution inquiry by the government, the chief minister said that she had received complaints that several of the beneficiaries had misused it. She said that those who had misused the funds had no right to object to the inquiry ordered by the government. Mayawati said that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, in its report, had said that the funds between September 1995 to May 1996 was distributed in violation of the rules. This was the period when Vora ran the administration of the state under President's rule. Vora, said the chief minister, had also disbursed the CM's discretionary fund for which he was not authorised.

7,"I'm on the right side of the law, says top hacker","AHMEDABAD: Hackers are generally expected to hide in the dark alleys of the cyber-world, ambushing corporate and government data when they least expect it. But one of India''s top hackers, Ankit Fadia, boasts about being a hacker.

""Most people don''t know that there are hackers and there are crackers,"" says the 17-year-old who is in Ahmedabad to lecture students and professionals at the Nirma Institute of Technology.

""Hackers are the good guys, who detect loopholes in websites and tell the concerned agency about it. Crackers are the bad guys who use loopholes to indulge in illegal activities. Like breaking into a bank website, downloading credit card numbers and making purchases on-line.""

To dispel the myths, Ankit is helping organise a national gathering of hackers at Pune in October called Hack. It will be on the lines of the annual Black Hat event in the US where hundreds of hackers come together and try to hack into each others computers.

Ankit will be studying undergraduate computer science at the Stanford University in the US in October, but will come down specially for the event. The Indian version of Black Hat however is not expected to be as large as its original.

""We have only about 15 to 20 genuine hackers. To be effective, you need knowledge of both writing software as well as networks, but Indians concentrate on one or the other.""

According to him, Indians also lack the attitude that hard-core hackers need; the ability to think like crackers. ""You can help fight cyber criminals only if you can think like a criminal.""

The only answer, Ankit feels, is universities in the country recognise the importance of security and start full-fledged courses on it. ""Today, Indian universities devote only one module on security.

The subject is so large that you would not understand a fraction in that time."" Ankit picked up most of his knowledge from books and sheer perseverance.

Apart from being a teenager who has written three books on security issues, Ankit also claims to work for an international intelligence agency breaking encrypted messages by criminals and terrorists.

It is a kind of secretive digital cloak-and-dagger world that he does not talk much about except the odd intriguing bit of information, like he was asked to decipher e-mails from Al Qaeda operatives.

""The Al Qaeda were encrypting their messages and then hiding them inside image and audio files which is one of the latest methods of protecting messages,"" he says.

""India, on the other hand, uses outdated encryption technology because we borrow it from the US. These technologies are created by the US defence forces and they are not allowed to send it outside the US for at least two years. As a result, the codes have already been broken by the time we start using them.""

Ankit has not even stepped on the Stanford University campus as yet but he is clear what he wants to do in the future.

""After my undergraduate degree, I will set up my own security company at Singapore with offices in Hyderabad, Pune and Bangalore. On the face of it we will be a security company, but behind this front we will do a lot of intelligence work.""

8,Truckers to meet transport minister on Thursday,"NEW DELHI: The nationwide indefinite strike by truckers demanding stable fuel prices and fewer levies entered the fourth day on Thursday even as the agitating unions are set to meet the road transport minister to resolve the crisis.

J M Saksena, secretary general of the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), the largest truckers'' union with 2.7 million vehicles in its fold, said they would meet Minister for Road Transport B C Khanduri in the afternoon with their 10 demands.

The strike has also affected cargo movement out of ports as also export consignments. Cement and steel despatches too have been badly hit.

The trucker''s demands include putting an end to frequent hike in diesel prices, immunity from the planned Value Added Tax, repeal of an order to scrap 15-year-old trucks and fixing minimum freight rates.

9,"Talks between govt, truckers fail","

NEW DELHI: The crucial talks between government and striking transporters on Thursday failed to make any progress to end the four-day long strike with both the parties sticking to their positions.

Truckers'' union leader J M Saksena said the strikers were ready to remain off the job until their 10-point charter of demands were met. They include calls for stable fuel prices, immunity from a planned Value Added Tax, repeal of an order to scrap old trucks and the setting of minimum freight rates.

""The strike will go on as long as our demands are not fulfilled,"" Saksena, secretary general of All India Motor Transport Congress (AITMC), the largest truckers'' union with 2.7 million vehicles, told Reuters just before entering talks with transport minister B C Khanduri.

On Wednesday, Khanduri said detailed discussions were needed before a deal could be struck but added the two sides had ""no major disagreements"".

The truckers, who carry the bulk of India''s freight, went off the roads on Monday.

Ports around the country have virtually come to a standstill as a result of the strike. ""Port operations have been badly hit since there is no inward and outward movement of cargoes, said A K Joti, chairman of Kandla Port, one of the nation''s busiest.

""Trucks are the lifeline for freight movement in India.""

Some major firms, including India''s biggest car maker, Maruti Udyog Ltd, a unit of Japan''s Suzuki Motor Corp, said it might suspend production as the strike had hit supplies.

Saksena said the union, which had allowed trucks to continue moving milk and cooking gas, would carry through with a vow to stop transporting essential goods if their demands were not met by Friday. ""It (the move) will be implemented,"" he said.

Vegetables and fruits were still being delivered by smaller vehicles but shop owners in many parts of India said prices had begun to climb due to erratic deliveries and fears of shortages.

11,Allahabad HC stays Amar Singh's arrest,"LUCKNOW: The Allahabad High Court on Thursday stayed till May 16 the arrest of Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh in connection with the cases of alleged misuse of discretionary funds filed against him and others by the Mayawati government.

He also apprehended that the persons named in the FIRs could be arrested anytime under pressure from Mayawati.

State''s Principal Secretary (Home) Pradeep Kumar, SHO Hazratganj and BSP state president K K Sachan have been made respondents in the petition.

As many as 136 FIRs were registered against SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and others pertaining to the misuse of discretionary funds during Yadav''s stint as UP Chief Minister.

Besides, one FIR was registered at the Hazratganj police station in Lucknow by BSP state president K K Sachan in which Yadav, Amar Singh and Leader of Opposition in the Vidhan Sabha Azam Khan and five others were charged with forcibly entering the BSP office and preparing forged electronic documents (CDs) and doctoring them.

13,State projects marginal rise in industrial investments,"KOLKATA: West Bengal expects industrial investments to rise marginally from 2,300 crore last year to 2,500 crore in 2003, state commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said Thursday.

Sen said the increase would be facilitated by more iron and steel units, mineral based industries, downstream units in Haldia, information technology units pumping in money the state this year.

The minister was addressing a meeting of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

15,Foreign law firms eye immigrants from Gujarat,"AHMEDABAD: Ramesh Shah, name changed), holds a US visa for ten years and his passport shows that he recently travelled to the US thrice within six months. In fact, he hasnâ€™t. He had, however, given his passport to his immigration consultant for filing an H-1B visa. The consultant allegedly handed it to others seeking entry in the US.

Shah was frantically searching for an immigration law expert to take legal action against the consultant and also to solve other legal problems.

With rising cases of frauds and irregularities in the immigration industry, many like Shah have to opt for the counselling offered by NRI lawyers and foreign immigration law firms. Gujarat, which is ranked third in outward bound flow, does not have a single state-based immigration lawyer who can handle immigration-related grievances.

Maulin Raval, an advocate associated with the Indo US Legal Service, New York, who is handling Shahâ€™s case says, â€œThere are no immigration attorneys in Gujarat who can guide visa applicants on the legal aspects of making a contract with their agents or foreign employers.â€� Raval deals with US immigration cases with the help of an NRI immigration attorney based in New York. He, however, plans to open a liaison or a branch office of a global immigration law firm in Ahmedabad.

Natubhai Ajmera, an advocate dealing with immigration cases in Canada, in collaboration with an NRI immigration attorney in Montreal, says, â€œMost of the immigration agents here do not have a background in law and most of them are not even equipped to deal with the legal complexities rising in immigration issues.â€� Dr A C Joshi, project officer, Gujarat State Legal Services Authority (GSLSA) says, â€œLaw schools in Gujarat do not have a specialised course on immigration and international laws. We require special focus on immigration law studies that can equip the lawyers with knowledge about ever-changing immigration laws for â€˜hotâ€™ immigration destinations.â€� With the number of emigration clearance for contractual employment abroad increasing from 1.99 lakh 1999 to 3.68 lakh in 2002, immigration problems have also increased.

â€œWith the increasing outbound flow, shortage of expert guidance on immigration issues and international work laws is becoming acute,â€� says Girish Patel, senior advocate with the Gujarat High Court. He laments, â€œThe stateâ€™s legal education system and their products need to alter their expertise in accordance with the market need.â€� According to WTO norms, the Indian market has open its doors to foreign service industry by 2005.

NRIs and foreign law firms are eager to tap the stateâ€™s market,which ranks third manpower export abroad but has no immigration lawyers to solve their issues. Hamel Shah, an immigration lawyer in New Jersey, says, â€œThere are many agents who take advantage visa applicants, who are misguided about immigration visa procedures. Looking the demand from an untapped Gujarat market, may start a satellite office the state soon.â€�

In Gandhinagar, Chief Minister Narendra Modi strongly criticised the arrest of Pravin Togadia on charges of sedition.

State VHP leaders are of the opinion that deputy prime minister L K Advani should intervene in the matter which has assumed serious proportions.
