1,Six cops injured in Kolaghat clash,"KOLKATA: Six policemen were injured in a clash allegedly with supporters of Congress and Trinamul Congress.

The state chief electoral officer has asked the East Midnapore district magistrate to send a detailed report on the incident.

Giving details of the incident, IGP (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee told journalists that the trouble started on Friday at Sagarbat in the Kolaghat police station area when Congress and Trinamul supporters tried to prevent sinking of a tubewell by CPM panchyat member Musharraf Housain.

The IG said the Congress and Trinamul supporters parties opposed the digging of the tubewell, saying that it would violate the model code of conduct.

On Saturday morning, when a police team reached the spot, the agitating mob along with villagers demanded arrest of Houssain and later they started throwing stones at the police party.

""The police had to open fire to disperse the mob. Six policemen were injured, "" the IGP (law and order) added.

A sub-inspector was rushed to a local hospital with fractured collar, he said. Twenty-five arrests were made, where reinforcements were rushed to prevent any recurrence of trouble.

""I will inquire into the matter and see whether there is any violation of code of conduct by a CPM member of the gram panchayat,"" the CEO said.

West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee acting president Pradip Bhattacharya said, however, that the Congress members had staged the road block at Kolaghat in protest against the attack on a Congress upapradhan of Sagarbat village by a CPM activist.

4,"Infoscions party, Wiproites wait","BANGALORE: This week was champagne time at Bangalore''s two best known corporate campuses: Infosys and Wipro. Both companies showed that the off-shore phenomenon is here to stay and that the global delivery model they have perfected is robust by cracking the billion dollar revenue target.

But culturally, it would be difficult to find two companies as different from each other as Infosys and Wipro.

While Infosys actually uncorked the champagne and celebrated the big day by embracing everyone who had contributed to its journey and threw a big bash at its campus, Wipro treated it like just another day.

Infosys had obviously planned the event well in advance - which saw some 10,000 Infoscians dance the night away - as it made the effort to locate its first customer, first investor and fly them to Bangalore.

Obviously caught off guard by Infosys going to town, Wipro seemed to have decided to treat it like a routine earnings announcement and not make a song and dance about it.

This when Wipro had more to crow about: after years it grew faster than Infosys and regained the coveted largest listed IT company status in 2003-04.

While the differences may be explained away as just a cultural thing, in a time and place when the hunt for talent and its retention is a big issue, it has come as a real surprise that Wipro didn''t do anything for employees on the big day.

And it appears the Wipro employees are feeling a trifle miffed indeed, though Wipro denies that''s the case. For the current ""What''s in it for me?"" generation of employees there wasn''t much to crow about on the big day.

In contrast, shareholders got a bounty. A 1250 per cent special dividend plus the regular 200 per cent dividend which made company chairman Azim Premji richer by Rs 566 cr, tax free at that.

Infosys not only paid out a even more handsome special dividend (2000 per cent) and regular dividend 590 per cent to shareholders but also gave out a special one time bonus of about $1000 (Rs 44,000) per employee on an average which cost the company $23-m or Rs 100 cr.

Considering that stock ownership is more widespread among Infosys employees than Wipro''s, Infosys employees benefited both from the higher dividend and the cash bonus. A tee-shirt and Titan watch which can display 24 time zones added to the feel good.

Pratik Kumar, head of HR at Wipro downplayed the issue saying, ""I don''t think the employees are upset. The feedback we got was more like: When is our party?""

And when is it? ""There will be a moment, a rhythm, a time, which is not linked to this, an employee event, a good occasion which we will celebrate,"" he said without giving specifics.

Infosys no doubt decided to use the $1-b landmark to burnish its reputation as a good employer which had taken a hit in the last couple of years.

The contrasting attitudes are beginning to reflect in the attrition rates at the two companies. Infosys, despite its recent employee troubles saw attrition rates at 10.4 per cent in FY 04 against 14.5 per cent for Wipro Technologies.

In fact, Vivek Paul, vice chairman, Wipro in a post earnings conference call with analysts on Friday said that despite salary hikes in October last, the company is feeling pressure at entry level and for those with 3/4 years experience.

Average salary cost is expected to rise this year by 14 per cent and the company might think of a salary hike later this year. Infosys salary hikes are expected to be about 17 per cent this year.

Obviously, Wipro does think that something needs to be done. It has decided to introduce a restricted stock award scheme which is more employee-friendly compared to the ESOP scheme wherein most options given are underwater in the current environment.
