0,"'Babus pull strings, not ministers'","BANGALORE: JD (U) floor leader in the Council, Basavaraja Horatti, has accused the government of making the bureaucracy more powerful than ministers.

""The instructions of only two ministers are followed promptly; the rest have to literally plead with bureaucrats. That the Congress government has failed to keep the bureaucracy under control is an insult to the political executive,"" he said, while participating in a discussion on the governorâ€™s speech.

Horatti, recollecting an incident, said a minister had to salute the department secretary to get his constituency work done. ""Ministers are empowered to order their officials to carry out work. But the situation here is the opposite. The government should initiate action against officials, who show scant respect towards ministers.""

Chairman BL Shankar said ministers should stop visiting their department officers for work. ""Every minister has the right to summon his department officers and secretaries for official work. They neednâ€™t make errand to the offices of their subordinates,"" he added.

1,PMC slashes farm plot regularisation charges,"PUNE: The ruling Congress-NCP combine in the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) has reduced the gunthewari regularisation charges from Rs 69 per square metre to Rs 40 per square metre.

The reduced rate will be appli-cable not just for the fringe vil-lages, but also the gunthewari constructions in city areas.

Citizens who have already paid a sum more than this amount will get a refund The decision was taken at a joint meeting of Congress-NCP leaders recently, mayor Dipti Chaudhari announced on Monday.

NCP leader Rajlaxmi Bhosale and deputy mayor Dilip Barate, who were present at the mayorâ€™s press conference, asserted that their party supports the decision.

â€œOur MLA, Kumar Gosavi, was present at the joint meet-ing,â€� Bhosale said, adding that the party would not press for fur-ther reduction in the charges.

The civic administration had recommended Rs 100 per square meter for regularisation in city as well as fringe villages. How-ever, the general body had resolved to reduce it to Rs 69 per square metre.

Barate and Gosavi had chal-lenged the GBâ€™s decision and ap-pealed to the state government to regularise these construc-tions free of cost.

Following their protest, the then chief min-ister Vilasrao Deshmukh had stayed the regularisation process in the 23 fringe villages.

The stay was vacated two months ago, with Deshmukh di-recting the PMC to consider the demand made by the NCP lead-ers. Accordingly, the mayor or-ganised the joint meeting of the Congress and NCP leaders.

Besides Barate and Gosavi, the meeting was attended by stand-ing committee chairman Dilip Tupe, NCP city unit chief Prakash Dhere and Congress city unit chief Mohan Joshi.

The regularisation charges include scrutiny fee, hardship pre-mium, land development charge and other fees. However, the break up of the figure of Rs 40 has not yet been decided.

This break up will be done when a formal proposal recom-mending the reduction in the regularistion charges will be tabled before the general body meeting this month, Congressman Abhay Chhajed said The break up is important since depending on the size of the construction made on one guntha plot, the total charge may differ. However, citizens will have to pay around Rs 5,000 for regularising the construc-tion on one guntha.

In the civic budget for the forthcoming financial year, 2003-2004, the PMC has estimated a revenue of Rs 50 crore through regularisation charges. The mayor, however, refuted that reduction in regularisation charges will affect the revenue collection.

â€œAs we have reduced the rates, it will come as an incentive to the citizens. As more people will opt for regularisation, the revenue will not be affected,â€� she argued.

2,Cong to fight panchayat polls alone,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal Congress has ruled out any possibility of an alliance with the Trinamul Congress for the coming panchayat polls in the state saying that it is against tying up with any political party that has joined hands with the BJP.

Addressing a convention of block Congress presidents in the city on Monday, AICC general secretary Kamal Nath said the party would fight the panchayat polls alone. A national convention of all block presidents would be held in Delhi from March 28, he said.

State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee later told the media that an overwhelming number of party leaders were of the opinion that the Congress should not have any truck with the Trinamul as long as it remained allied to the BJP.

â€œWe canâ€™t have any truck with a party which is in alliance with communal forces,â€� said Mukherjee. He, however, added that such an alliance could be possible if Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee parted ways with the BJP and expressed her desire to go with the Congress.

Mukherjee was confident that this time the Congress would do much better than the last panchayat polls. Attempting to brush away the Trinamulâ€™s charges that the Congress was acting as the CPMâ€™s â€œB-teamâ€�, Nath argued that a floor coordination with the CPM in Parliament did not mean that the Congress was supporting the CPM.

â€œWe are the main Opposition in Parliament and it our responsibility to arrange for floor coordination against the BJP. But that does not mean that we have pardoned the CPM for misrule in West Bengal,â€� said Nath. He castigated the Trinamul as the BJPâ€™s â€œBteamâ€�.

4,HC lets VHP hold rally in Anantapur,"HYDERABAD/ANANTAPUR: Pravin Togadia was detained by the Andhra Pradesh police early on Monday, but the High Court intervened hours later and gave an interim order that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad general secretary''s public meeting in Anantapur later in the day be allowed to be held.

Accordingly, Togadia spoke at the meeting in the evening,, titled Hindu Garjana, where he continued his tirade against Muslim ''appeasement'' and secularists.

The police had on Sunday withdrawn the permission they had given earlier to the VHP to hold the meeting, citing law and order problems. The VHP filed a petition against the withdrawal in the High Court on Monday, and Justice Somayajulu directed the Anantapur district administration to let the meeting go through, but take measures to ensure that it passed peacefully.

Following this directive, the police freed Togadia, who had been taken into custody at a AP-Karnataka border checkpost on Monday morning.

Togadia''s arrest and subsequent detention at a government guest house in Penukonda caused tension in Anantapur and other towns in the district. Police made elaborate arrangements to prevent communal clashes.

The issue was the subject of a hot debate in the Assembly, with BJP leader N Indrasena Reddy accusing the police of bowing to political pressure by denying permission at the last minute to a body that was not banned.

""The police are unnecessarily creating tension by withholding permission. This is a democratic country and all organisations have a right to hold rallies and express their views,"" Reddy said.

The BJP did not take kindly to the detention of Togadia as also the arrest of VHP leader Acharya Dharmendra in Madhya Pradesh. In Delhi, BJP general secretary Mukthar Abbas Naqvi warned, ""Arresting members of a religious and social organisation for political reasons can only lead to social tensions.""

5,Joshi hits out at Cong-led UDF govt in Kerala,"NEW DELHI: Human Resource Development Minister Murli Manohar Joshi on Tuesday used the occasion of completion of five years of the Vajpayee Government to hit out at the Congress-led UDF Government in Kerala saying that the recent attack on tribals at Muthanga was ''shameful''.

""It is shameful that in a modern society, such heinous incidents are tolerated.....I have been told of the recent gruesome incident of organised attack on adivasis at Muthunga..... and cases of police atrocities in Kerala,"" he said.

Noting that Kerala has many firsts on the Human Development Index but was lagging behind in industrial growth and employment generation, Joshi said ""if the state has to come out of the present mess, it has to have a serious rethink at the political level. It has to discard the burden of Communist ideas standing in the way of progress"".

The state has an unemployment growth rate of 20.97 per cent as against the national average of 3.45 per cent, he said adding that the state Government was not speedily implementing the restructuring of power, transport and public sector reforms. The Agricultural sector has been stagnating for the last many decades, he said.

9,'State governments should create enabling environment',"KOCHI: Globalisation has thrown immense opportunities for the small industries in India, and it is the duty of the government to create an environment conducive to the growth of small scale sector, Zoltan J Acs, an international expert on small and medium industries said.

Speaking on ''Public policy on Small Industry in the Post WTO Era: International Experience and Lessons for India'', Acs, a former Chief Economic Advisor to the small business administration of USA, said India had thousands of opportunities besides the added advantage of an educated labour force and resources.

The state governments should create an environment which would help the small and medium business enterprises to grow.

A global economy presented both a threat and provided opportunities to the small enterprises, he said, adding with the help of technology and entrepreneurial skill one could compete in global economy.

Giving example, he said he had come across a small group of furniture manufacturers in Jaipur, who were making ''look old'' furniture for the export market. Their product had a good market in the US.

One great success story in India was the software and IT industry in Bangalore. The call centres had given vast opportunities to the industry as the time difference between India and US suited the call centre and the English speaking and qualified work force were added advantages, Acs said.

There were immense opportunities everywhere, but they need to be recognised and exploited, Acs, who is presently working as the Professor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the R G Merrick School of Management, University of Baltimore, said.

The lecture was organised jointly by the United States Consulate, Chennai, and the Institute of Small Enterprises and Development, Kochi.

11,Bar owners will protest by not renewing licences,"MUMBAI : Nearly 2,000 bar owners in the city will not renew their permit room licences in protest against the governmentâ€™s decision to go ahead with the 300 per cent hike in licence fees.

The deadline for renewal ends on March 31. The revised fees became effective following the removal of high court stay on the issue last week. The Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association had filed a petition in 2001 challenging the state governmentâ€™s decision to increase the licence fees from Rs 1.6 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs.

The stay on the fee hike was vacated last week and the state government has already started issuing notices to bar owners to pay the revised charges, said A.B. Shetty, president of the association. decision not to renew the licences was taken at an emergency meeting of the association.

â€œBar owners are not in a position to pay Rs 5 lakhs by way of licence fees but they are agreeable to a ten per cent hike on the fees,â€™â€™ Mr Shetty contends. Many bars in the city have already shut down because they are no longer profitable.

Mr Shetty said that bars which do not renew their licences by March 31 will not be able to serve liquor but they will continue to operate as eateries. He said the state should reconsider its decision as it stands to lose revenue from licence fees and excise duty on liquor. State excise minister Anil Deshmukh was not available for comment.

12,New rules for farm insurance scheme soon,"NEW DELHI: The Union agriculture ministry says it will soon announce new rules for the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) to enable more coverage of farmers.

Successor to the Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (1985-99), the ministry says NAIS is a big improvement on the former. Various food and non-food crops may be covered for all natural, non-preventible risks. All loanee farmers are compulsorily covered, with small and marginal ones eligible for a half-subsidy on premium. GIC is presently the implementing agency and the Union and state governments share the premium subsidy bill.

Around 10 million farmers had been covered till March last year, a cropped area coverage of 33 million hectares. The idea now is to expand its scope, based on various recommendations on the way it has worked.

15,LDF-sponsored hartal sparks sporadic violence,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sporadic violence targeting government offices, vehicles and police marked the Opposition LDF-sponsored dawn-to-dusk hartal and disrupted normal life across Kerala on Tuesday.

Police fired three rounds in the air at Taliparamba in Kannur district to disperse hartal-supporters who pelted stones and tried to storm into a Deputy Superintendent''s office, while a police jeep was torched in Panur in the same district.

The hartal, the second in seven days, was called to protest alleged ''police repression'' on LDF marchers to SP''s offices yesterday to press for a judicial probe into police action against tribal agitators at Muthanga in Wayanad district last February 19.

Widespread pelting of stones at police, government offices and banks were reported from most districts, and a crude bomb exploded at an electricity board office but no casualty was reported. At Darmadom near Thalassery and a Congress party office was torched at nearby Chirakkuni, police said.

A truck was partly burnt at Punnapra in Alappuzha district.

Though the transport sector was spared from the hartal, State Roads Transport Corporation did not operate regular services and private services also kept off the road for fear of violence.

Though want of proper transport facilities caused hardship to students and parents, the SSLC examination scheduled for the day went off without much of a problem except in a few centres in Kasargode district.

Shops and business establishments remained closed throughout the state.
