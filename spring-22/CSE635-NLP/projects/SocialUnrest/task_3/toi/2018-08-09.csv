1,Proposed jail caught in political quagmire,"surat: even before the things could take off, the proposed 'model central jail' here appears to have landed into controversy. there is a protest brewing over the upcoming project among the locals residing near the proposed site at ichhapore. scheduled for completion by year-end, the proposed site is yet to be earmarked despite repeated assurances by the ministry in the last several months. moreover, contradictory statements as made out to the representatives of ichhapore khedut samaj (iks) by authorities of gidc which owns the land on which the jail is planned and by local representatives of people have further compounded the issue. according to iks convenor janakkumar patel, when the representatives met the gidc authorities on monday at gandhinagar, they were told that the project was already finalised while sources in the ministry said that several things were still unfinished. and, any decision to change the site was not possible at this stage as stated out by gidc authorities, according to patel. however, minister for jail and rural housing jaspal singh told 'the times of india' over phone from gandhinagar that it might take six months or longer to get things aligned for such kind of project. reacting to a report in a section of the press, singh said that on tuesday he made just a passing remark in the state assembly about the financial aspects of the proposed jail in surat and certainly not the things as reported. when asked, he said apprehension about possibilities of the whole area becoming unsafe from law and order point of view would be a wrong assumption as by any stretch of imagination it could not be established that by having a jail would lead to deterioration of the law and order situation in the nearby areas. rather on the other hand, it would be the safest area with proper security provisions for the kind of model jail being proposed there, singh opined. he informed that the jail would have 20 feet wall, surrounded by security posts at regular distances. not only this, the area would provide means of livelihood to locals by having shops and other trading activities once the jail becomes operational, he said. the minister informed that several aspects would have to be looked into. finance for the project was being worked out as even by selling the existing district jail in the city would not fetch the amount of money required for the proposed model jail, singh stated. but, for other things, there needs to be an independent view taking into all aspects, he said. during monsoon, the area becomes waterlogged, for which moats could be developed round the jail for passage of rainwater, he informed. but, an independent inquiry into all these was required before floating of tenders for construction of the prison, for which he would visit the city shortly to get several things clarified, he informed. meanwhile, around six lakh of locals residing in 42 villages in and around ichhapore have decided to approach various political parties to stall the project from being developed there. according to iks convenor patel, if the government was adamant to go ahead with the project, they would have no option than to resort to seek support from the other political parties. but, the villagers would like the ruling government to look into the affair, for which a team of 18 representatives from different villages went to gandhinagar to meet the chief minister keshubhai patel on monday. but the chief minister could not meet them due to some reasons, according to patel. iks representatives claimed to have support from the representatives of industries like kribhco and ongc located in the vicinity. sources in these industries confirmed that the industries located here would not like to have a jail in the midst of them.

3,Parents worry about principals and principles,"bangalore: the recent incident in which the principal of the baldwin methodist college allegedly hired men to beat up the principal of the baldwin boys high school has sent shock waves among those connected with the school fraternity, specially parents. they now question the values that educational institutions impart, and the role of principals. bangalore times spoke to a few parents and principals to find out what they had to say on the issue. writer shashi deshpande says one should have expected this to happen, with corruption percolating to all levels and areas of society. ""it should be taken as a warning. we of the middle class are so smug, with the attitude that as long as something does not happen to us, it does not affect us. we can no longer sit back and let such things happen."" for her, what would matter most about a principal is that he is honest and sincere and concerned about education and the young. ""also, he should realise that he makes a big contribution to society."" according to deepika mansingh, a parent whose son studies in a local college, there is a general decline in values in society at large, and the education system is only a part of it. as a parent, she expects the principal of an educational institution to have high principles, as he moulds the ethos of the institution. he should be a person that the students can look up to, an ideal role model. dr k p gopalakrishna, founder-principal of national public school, says that in general, the incident speaks of the kind of value systems prevalent now. he also adds that in certain cases, parents are responsible for creating such circumstances. this opinion is seconded by h s vishwanath, a parent whose daughter is in college. ""the current education system smacks of commercialisation. rich parents are willing to pay any amount to get their child admitted to a reputed school. when the demand is so high, schools are in a bargaining position, and they exploit the situation. the system also gives rise to touts."" according to dr h narasimhiah, educationist and founder-principal, national college, basavanagudi and its group of institutions, nothing has been done to improve the value system in education. p k krishnamurthy, a parent with a schoolgoing child says that the motive behind the opening of many schools is to amass wealth, and not really to impart education. what else can you expect when schools accept donations? seeta anantasivan, trustee, prakriya school in koramangala that places a lot of importance on values says, ""the principal and the team, namely the teachers have to be able to live out the values they give the children. it is one thing to have value classes, but are they living it out?"" she adds that the world of education has been taken over by the competitive culture of business, and therefore, the violence of that world has also seeped into this. according to sources, admission time is a period fraught with tension for principals because that is when there is pressure from all sides, including political. at such times, principals seek police or political protection. sources also say that some principals regularly pay certain elements rs 10,000 to rs 15,000 a month to ward off unpleasantness.

4,Toddy making mooted to help coconut farmers,"kozhikode: manufacture of hard liquor, toddy and other products from coconut as substitutes for alcohol, soft drinks and vinegar are some suggestions mooted by farmers to bail them out from the crisis triggered by the fall in coconut prices. the farmers relief forum (rrf), which has been spearheading several agitations, in a representation to the kerala government has proposed coconut products as a complete alternative to spirit-based liquor. quoting from the findings of the kerala agriculture university which had developed `kera sudha,' a soft drink from coconut, rrf leaders said the commercial production of the soft drink would prove a big boon to the farmers. addressing a press conference here, they also demanded creation of cooperative movement modelled on milma (state milk cooperative) to win toddy-tapping rights to the farmers. ``the processing and marketing of toddy should be fully left with such societies to ensure fair price to the farmer. this will create more employment oopportunities besides protecting the existing tappers,'' forum chairman k.c. chakochan pointed out. some of the other proposals included distribution of coconut oil instead of palm oil through ration shops with subsidy, conversion of the rubber board into a procurement agency, mini-hydel power projects, solar fences, rrf general secretary baby zacharias said. accusing the antony government of being `anti-farmer', the forum had decided to boycott the proposed programmes by the government to honour farmers on malayalam new year day, `chingom' 1 (august 17), and to observe it as `farmers betrayal day' to take out `funeral processions.'' all the krishi bhavans in the state would be picketed on that day, the leaders added.

5,DPCC discusses civic polls,"new delhi: city chief minister sheila dikshit called a meeting of the delhi pradesh congress committee and mlas from east delhi on wednesday to discuss the municipal elections next year. she plans to call another meeting of mlas and councillors from other areas to devise their election strategy. sources said the party had decided to oppose the rotation of seats as it reduced the credibility of councillors before their electorate. the leaders felt that the anti-incumbency factor will work in the congress' favour only if rotation is not resorted to. it was also decided in the meeting that the corporation would not be restructured before the elections as it would delay the polls, which would work to the bjp's advantage. in a related development, the congress leaders in the corporation have launched an offensive over the imposition of property tax on unauthorised colonies by the mcd. the congress, which is the opposition party in the mcd, has also decided to launch an attack on the bjp for being vague about the regularisation of sainik farms. leader of the opposition, ram babu sharma, said: ``the corporation should first provide sanitation and health services in unauthorised colonies, and then levy taxes. without providing services, the mcd should not collect tax. the bjp also keeps shifting its stand on sainik farms. it should put an end to the matter because a demolition at sainik farms will be a colossal waste of money and resources.''

6,Left to produce film on party exploits,"kolkata: after holding meetings all over west bengal, urging the party activists to emulate former left front chairman sailen dasgupta and former centre of indian trade unions president niren ghosh, the cpm has now decided to produce a film on the two departed leaders. the documentary film, to be directed by shantanu bhattacharya, will highlight the sacrifices made by the communist party during the freedom struggle and its fight for restoration of democracy during the emergency. the film will specially target the new entrants in the cpm who joined the party after it came to power and are largely unaware of the hardship the leaders had to undergo for a prolonged period for their cause. the decision to make the film was finalised at a meeting at alimuddin street headquarters of the cpm on wednesday. polit bureau member biman bose, north 24 parganas district committee member amitabha nandi and the director were present. ever since dasgupta and ghosh died, alimuddin street bosses have been on a whirlwind tour of the districts, holding commemorative meetings to declare a war of words against corruption and anti-party activities within the cpm. significantly, the film is being funded by the faction ridden north 24 parganas district unit of the cpm and is being looked after by nandi, the powerful district committee leader who has been locked in a bitter battle with the transport minister subhas chakraborty. dasgupta had been put in charge of the district on behalf of the cpm state committee and the anti-subhas lobby was known to be comfortable in his presence. ghosh, too, was known to be a strong opponent of the transport minister's liberal political views.

10,Advani suggests TADA-like law for J&K,"new delhi: a day after government decided to extend armed forces special powers act to new areas in jammu and kashmir, home minister l k advani suggested that a tada-like law was needed to fight militants better. advani made the suggestion in both houses of parliament when they discussed the recent killings in the state. the terrorism and disruptive activities (prevention) act (tada) lapsed in 1995, and there has been no political consensus on a replacement. killing fieldsin the rajya sabha, advani read out an extract for an old standing committee report on cross-border terrorism which said that the lack of an anti-terrorist law was a major handicap, and it let many criminals go scot-free. ``i will be happy if the government brings about a law (to counter terrorism) and it gets your cooperation,'' he said. last year, the government failed to get the opposition to support a draft anti-terrorism act. advani had raised the same issue in the lok sabha while replying to a discussion on a calling attention motion on the jammu and kashmir situation. he suggested that the states which faced terrorism should enact similar laws and not wait for a nation-level consensus. ``if necessary, i would recommend a law of this kind at the jammu and kashmir-level,'' advani said. at the beginning of the debate, advani read out a statement which mentioned the decision to extend the armed forces (jammu and kashmir) special powers act, 1990 to the remaining districts of the jammu province. the special powers act is already in force in the entire kashmir province and the 20 kilometre-belt along the indo-pakistan border in jammu region. now the entire state, barring the ladakh region, will be declared a disturbed area and covered by the act. the act gives the security forces more powers to deal with militants -- and offers considerable protection to their personnel from legal action for alleged excesses committed during operations. if a tada like law is ever enacted again it will make it easier for the government to book alleged militants. but the opposition in the past has dismissed tada as a `draconian' act directed at the muslim minority. advani said it was decided at wednesday's meeting that the state police will also step up action ``as per law'' against ``overground supporters'' of militants. though the minister did not link this with his suggestion for a tada-like law, an anti-terrorist law will make it easier to book people who ``associate'' with militants. advani rejected the suggestion that the security forces had `failed' in jammu and kashmir. vulnerable, soft targets were now being attacked only because the security forces had scored some major successes recently against militants. the home minister predicted there would always be ups and downs in the proxy war in jammu and kashmir. the opposition renewed its demand for advani's resignation on moral grounds. and to register its protest over the government's handling of the jammu and kashmir situation, almost the entire opposition walked out before he completed his reply his reply in the lok sabha. in the rajya sabha too, the opposition staged a walk-out just as advani finished speaking. the minister said the government was committed to take all possible steps for the protection of ``remote, scattered and minority populations''in jammu and kashmir. the number of special police officers (spos) --civilian volunteers who help the police, is being increased by 1000 in doda district -- where militants have stuck thrice since july 21. the existing village defence committees will be made more effective. similar defence committees for shepherds at their temporary settlements will also be ``experimented with.'' ``special intelligence-driven security force operations based on surprise and speed would also be considered as per requirements of the ground situation,'' advani said. he said the unified headquarters fighting insurgency in jammu and kashmir had been asked to ``initiate fresh tactics and modified dynamic deployments'' to instill confidence among people in affected areas like doda. advani asked the mps to appreciate that the country was fighting a proxy war unleashed by an `inimical country which had no qualms in rationalising the brutal killings of men,women and children as a `freedom struggle.''' he listed a serious of objectives the militants might be aiming at when they carried out the recent spate of attacks. these included stretching the security forces, creating a communal divide with possible repercussions in the rest of the country as well, forcing the minorities to flee to safer areas and attracting media attention. he said the security forces will not lessen their anti-infiltration posture, nor let the counter-insurgency grid in the state thin out. congress chief whip priya ranjan dasmunshi accused him of not being alert to the possibility of militant strikes after the failure of the agra summit.

11,Scathing Amnesty report irks govt,"kolkata: amnesty international will release its first major report on human rights in left front-ruled west bengal on friday. and even before publication, the report has evoked an angry response from the state government. the 50-page report, `time to act to stop torture and impunity in west bengal', ""sets out evidence of widespread abuse of police powers including illegal detention, corruption and extortion which is regularly accompanied by torture and ill-treatment."" it also observes that the state government ""appears to have sidelined human rights to the remit of the west bengal human rights commission but failed to take this statutory body seriously"". the london-based human rights organisation had sent the report to chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee a month in advance for his response. on july 20, the joint secretary, home (human rights cell) wrote to his counterpart in the union government, with a copy to amnesty international, giving the state's opinion. the letter accuses amnesty of ""distortions, half-truths and slanders, with the sole aim at maligning the state government, tarnishing its image and undermining its sustained efforts to uphold the cause of human rights in the state"". asserting that the institutions of ""the largest functioning democracy in the world"" were adequately geared to preserve human rights, the state has gone further to suggest that ""we do not need any advice/guidance from a foreign organisation like amnesty international"". in reply, amnesty has pointed out that while the report itself underlines the importance of institutions such as the human rights commission which west bengal had been the first to set up, the state government has not countered any specific information in the report. the report, it says, is not aimed at maligning the west bengal government but is part of a global campaign against torture and impunity. such reports have been brought out on many other countries including the united states, spain, israel, egypt, bangladesh, the philippines and several european countries. during the congress regime in 1974, amnesty international's `short report on detention conditions in west bengal jails' had also drawn flak from the then government and also drawn the international attention on the massacre of naxalites. the present report is based on the visit of amnesty delegates to the state in june 1999 and follow-up research. it makes copious references to the reports of west bengal human rights commission, state police commission and association for protection of democratic rights. among other measures, amnesty recommends that the state government should ""make a public commitment to end impunity for torturers"", ""implement existing legal sanctions against police officers found responsible for illegal actions"", ensure protection for those refusing to carry out illegal orders, speed up police reforms, and ""recognise the crucial role"" of human rights organisations. it has also made several recommendations to the wbhrc.

12,BJP for all-party panel to oversee flood relief work,"patna: the bjp on wednesday demanded constitution of an all-party committee under the chairmanship of the governor to carry on the relief work in an impartial manner in the flood-affected areas of the state. in a memorandum to the governor on wednesday, the bjp also demanded convening of a special session of the state legislature to discuss the flood and drought situations. it urged the governor to initiate steps for getting bihar declared as a ""scarcity-hit state"". besides, the bjp delegation, led by state president nand kishore yadav, demanded a judicial probe into the aurai (muzaffarpur) police firing on monday on a mob protesting against the irregularities in the distribution of the relief materials in which six persons died. the party said an ex-gratia of rs 5 lakh be paid to each of the victims' families and criminal cases be lodged against the officials responsible for the firing. charging the rabri government with carrying on the relief work in a partial manner concentrating on the areas represented by the rjd legislators only, the bjp delegation said that although 40 panchayats of the gopalganj district had been inundated by the flood, the relief work had been undertaken only in four panchayats. bjp legislator from the barauli constituency of gopalganj district ram pravesh rai alleged that the relief work was limited only to the areas represented by influential rjd legislator sadhu yadav in the district. the memorandum said 64 blocks of the state were affected by flood which had also damaged several embankments in the sitamarhi, gopalganj, east champaran, west champaran, muzaffarpur, darbhanga and sheohar districts. it said that the remaining part of the state was faced with a drought-like situation and paddy transplantation could be done only in 15 lakh hectares of land so far against the target of 38 lakh hectares. the party requested the governor to ensure that the quantum of relief materials being given to each flood-affected family is advertised in the newspapers. it should also be displayed at the notice boards in all the block offices concerned. it also urged the governor to direct the government not to collect school and college fees from the students of the flood and drought- affected areas.

13,HC orders govt to pay pvt primary teachers pension,"ahmedabad: the gujarat high court has directed the state government to prepare and implement within three months a suitable pension scheme for teachers of recognised private primary schools. the landmark judgment, which is likely to benefit thousands of retired primary school teachers, was given by a division bench comprising justice m r calla and justice n g nandi while deciding on an appeal by the state government against an hc judgment on a petition by a primary teacher, kusum borisada, of vadodara. the court ruled that primary teachers working in aided recognised private primary schools were entitled to pension benefits. the court observed that secondary and higher secondary teachers and teachers of affiliated colleges already get pension benefits. therefore there was no justification in denying pensionary benefits to primary teachers as such denial was violative of the equality guarantee enshrined in the article 14 and 16 of the constitution of india, the court said. the high court also said that pension as per the scheme directed should be paid from 1997. senior advocate haroobhai mehta with advocate j d ajmera appeared for the petitioner teacher, while additional government pleader harsha devani appeared for the state. after the petition was moved, a single judge of the court ordered the state government to give her pension benefits. the court had then also asked the state to formulate a scheme for pension. the details of the date from which the scheme would be made applicable will now be decided by the state government.

14,Protest over shifting school to Badal's in-laws' village,"bathinda: about a hundred persons from chak ram singh wala village of this district held a demonstration in front of the government school in the village, on monday, protesting the alleged political move to shift the location of the school. villagers, including women and children, sat on an indefinite dharna in front of the school after locking it, in protest against the move to shift the school to chak fateh singh wala village, the village of punjab chief minister parkash singh badal's in-laws. they said the dharna would not be lifted till the government clarified its stand. villagers said that on may 5 some of them had met the chief minister when he was at his in-laws' place, and had managed to persuade him to upgrade the village school. they alleged that in the guise of upgrading the school, some officials of the education department conspired to hand over the control of the school to the panchayat of chak fateh singh wala village. villagers said that a notification of the education department wrongly mentioned that the state government had decided to upgrade chak fateh singh wala high school to senior secondary level. they said there was no high school in chak fateh singh wala village, and the school mentioned was situated in chak ram singh wala village. though officials of the education department claimed that the change of name from chak ram singh to chak fateh singh was ``inadvertent'' and a ``clerical'' mistake, villagers alleged that it was part of their conspiracy to hand over the control of the school to the panchayat of chak fateh singh wala, thus serving their purpose of pleasing the chief minister's in-laws. villagers said they were agitated when last week the education department transferred a teacher to the upgraded school named as government senior secondary school, chak fateh singh wala, instead of chak ram singh wala.

15,"2 accidents, 10 injured, but no law in place","new delhi: there are no comprehensive, legally enforceable rules to govern the safety of over 35,000 cng vehicles plying on delhi's roads. an interim draft, prepared by the pune-based automotive research association of india, is the only document which lays down safety standards. experts say such a law is required, especially after the two accidents in the city which injured over 10 people. while five people were injured in a cylinder explosion in a cng car in shahdara, a fire broke out in a cng bus in punjabi bagh on sunday last. ``it is alarming to note that no safety guidelines are in place. but what is more worrying is that the current draft being used is not legally enforceable. the safety standards should be notified in the central motor vehicles rules,'' says centre for science and environment chairperson anil aggarwal. in absence of a law, he says, many violators can go scot-free. what is holding up the formation of such a law? union transport ministry officers put the ball in the court of the international organisation for standardisation. ``the bureau of indian standards normally waits for international guidelines before coming out with its own. as the iso hasn't yet come out with one on cng safety, bis don't have them as well,'' says a source. but there is more to it than the mere absence of international norms. a panel of experts, carved out of a 30-member technical panel for bis safety standards, was meant to study the draft prepared by pune-based arai. the panel, which was supposed to make adjustments in the code drafted by arai, has not even met once since its formation in february this year. incidentally, the arai director heads the bis technical panel as well. the absence of bis-formulated safety norms means the code of practices, a mere ``interim document'', is the only official draft governing safety of cng vehicles in delhi. indraprastha gas ltd, the only cng supplier, had begun inspecting cng fitments in vehicles after a cng-run car's cylinder exploded in northeast delhi's shahdara in april. ``we were only carrying out visual inspection. but, even it we find violations, we don't have the authority to penalise anyone for not adhering to safety standards,'' says igl commercial director, l lobo. aggarwal, who is also a member of the bhurelal committee which is assisting the supreme court, says: ``the arai draft document and the bis standards need not contradict each other.'' the real question, he says, is the review and inspection of vehicles. but union transport ministry officials promise action soon. ``the final draft prepared by the iso had been passed after voting on july 31. they are likely to be in place within a month or two.'' he said: ``while iso guidelines would be used as a broad guidelines, the national standards would be more specific.''

16,"Bill to protect plants, farmers passed in LS","new delhi: twenty months after the much-awaited bill on protection of plant varieties and farmers' rights was first moved in parliament, it finally made it through the lok sabha on thursday, complete with amendments. described as a first step towards recognising and protecting the rights of farmers, the redrafted bill, now headed for the rajya sabha, has a separate chapter on farmers' rights. it will provide for the formation of a national plant variety and farmers rights protection authority and encourage plant breeders by providing incentives to develop new varieties of plants. the objectives of this long-awaited legislation are three-fold. one, to stimulate investment in the research and development of new varieties, in both public and private sectors, by ensuring appropriate returns. two, facilitate growth of the seed industry through domestic and foreign investment, ensuring the availability of high-quality seeds and planting material to farmers. three, recognise the role of the farmer as a cultivator and conserver, and the contribution of traditional rural and tribal communities to the country's agro-biodiversity, by protecting their traditional rights and rewarding them through a benefit-sharing arrangement. the bill also seeks to provide protection against foreign firms. a firm with even one per cent of foreign equity would need the authority's permission to ``touch'' any material here, says an indian council of agricultural research scientist. scientists say this bill will ensure that if a scientist uses a traditional variety bred by generations of farmers and improves on it, the farmer or the community will be entitled to a share in the profits ^ probably benefiting through supportive government policies and programmes. the authority envisaged under the bill would accept applications, examine eligibility claims for registration and a breeder's right to reproduce and market. this authority, say officials, would also manage a national gene fund, where the community's share of the proceeds would be deposited. a tribunal would be set up to decide disputes. it envisages multiple rights for the farmer ^ rights over varieties cultivated or bought, the right to reuse seeds, even limited transfer or exchange of varieties. and, if a breeder claims a certain yield on a certain level of management, and this does not happen, the farmer can claim compensation. the bill would lay down the rules on this.

17,Stringency of narcotic laws not to be taken literally: SC,"new delhi: in a significant judgment relating to the execution of the controversial narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances act (ndpsa), the supreme court has held that the police should not interpret its ``stringency"" literally as that might render its compliance impossible. stringency, the court said, was because of the nature of crime involved in it and the strict obligations cast on police. a bench comprising chief justice a s anand, justice a p misra and justice shivaraj v patil said: ``the stringency is because of the type of crime involved under it, so that no such person escapes from the clutches of law. the court, however, while construing such provisions strictly should not interpret it so literally so as to render its compliance impossible"". the ndpsa being stringent to the persons involved in the field of illicit drug, traffic and drug abuse, the legislature time and again has made some of its provisions obligatory for the prosecution to comply, which the courts have interpreted it to be mandatory. the bench said if in a case the strict adherence of the mandate could result in delay in trapping of an accused, which might lead to escape of the accused, then the court should consider with caution and circumspection the non-compliance with certain provisions. the judgment is a fall out of an appeal by sajan abraham, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail and fined rs one lakh by the kerala high court. abraham was acquitted by the trial court of the charge of possessing an injectable narcotic drug and syringes to administer it. abraham had challenged his conviction on the ground that the information given to the police that he was allegedly selling narcotic drugs was not recorded by the police before the raiding party arrested him. a policeman got information that one sajan abraham was selling injectable narcotic drugs near blue tronic junction in palluruthy in kerala. when he proceeded for palluruthy police station to give this information to his immediate superiors, he met an officer on patrol duty and communicated the information to him. thereafter, the superior officer along with his police party immediately headed for the place where the accused was allegedly selling the banned drugs. ``had they (the police) not done so immediately, the opportunity of seizure and arrest of the accused would have been lost,"" the bench said. the apex court wondered as to how the superior officer could have recorded the information given by the policeman and communicated to his superiors when he was on motion being on patrol duty. ``had they not acted immediately, the accused would have escaped,"" it said. the court found that the police had communicated to the accused about his rights before search and seizure and held that it found no ground to interfere with the high court order.

26,SP bandh a flop show,"kanpur: it was almost a banned-banned show for the samajwadi party in the industrial capital of uttar pradesh as most of the markets remained open despite a total bandh call given by the samajwadi party. the administration pushed a huge contingent of police force to avert any untoward incident during the bandh in the city. cops chased away samajwadi party activists in various market areas. lathi-weilding cops also used cane-power against some upcoming sp activists who were trying to close shops forcibly. most of the shops in naveen market, birhana road, p road and gumti remained open in the city. the day-long bandh did not leave any impact both on trade and normal life. the impact of the bandh in public could be measured by the low number of sp workers who themselves courted arrest. according to official figures, around 400 people courted arrest in different prime localities of the city. however, samajwadi party district head anil shukla warsi claimed that the bandh was total in the city. the administration in a precautionary measure arranged heavy police force in all sensitive areas to foil any unruly attempts by the violent mob, which also caused a bit of fear amongst sp activists. the police force also took a threatening call by some sp activists very seriously. the call was to the effect, ""bandh dukan tumari khuli dukan hamari"" (your shops be closed and sp shops be opened). the bandh call given by the party gained part success in the outskirts of the city. samajwadi party workers led by local leader deepu chauhan blocked the national highway near bhauti. samajwadi party workers also tried to close the cooperative bank in bhauti area. internal bickering of the samajwadi party's district unit and the lack of zeal amongst local workers towards the state unit's call came to the fore during the kanpur bandh. most of the so-called heavy weights of the samajwadi party opted for early arrest for fear of being blamed for the flop show. national general secretary of the samajwadi party harbansh singh was arrested early in the morning from his house. while national leader and president of the up udyog vayapar mandal surendra mohan agarwal courted arrest along with his supporters in moolganj area.

31,SP protest had people's support: Mulayam,"lucknow: terming the kisan-jawan sangharsh day a complete success, the samajwadi party president mulayam singh yadav said it was the party's first warning to the rajnath singh government on its `anti-people policies'. he termed as totally undemocratic the methods adopted by the state administration to suppress the popular uprising against the bjp's `misrule' and failure on all fronts. yadav, who was in the state capital to personally `supervise' the agitation, said despite the force used by the police to suppress the demonstration and dharna, it proved to be a resounding success primarily on account of the popular support extended to it by the people. he said business establishments remained closed and the people took to the streets voluntarily to express their anger and dismay at the government's wrong policies. addressing a press conference, yadav minced no words in lashing out at the chief minister and the bjp for its fascist ways and said he wanted the government to `run' even before the elections were held. he added the day was not far when the sp would force open the locks of the government owned rice and wheat godowns and ensure that the same was distributed amongst the poor and the needy. he said it was ridiculous that while wheat was being allowed to rot by being stored in the open, the poor had to go to bed hungry. he said the massive response which the kisan-jawan sangharsh day evoked was the outcome of merely 4500 letters penned by him to the party mps, mlas (both present and former) and other office-bearers. the day he chose to distribute pamphlets amongst the workers, the response would be overwhelming. he said a taste of the same could be had from the workers' sammelan to be held at the party office in lucknow on august 16. referring to thursday's agitation and the arrests made, the sp chief said the worst affected was ambedkarnagar where police atrocities on the party workers was the maximum. former minister ram lakhan yadav and district president hira lal yadav were grievously injured and around 500 workers were arrested. in kanpur also where the bandh was near total, former mla rd pal was seriously hurt. the scenario was the same in varanasi and moradabad where women party workers were hit by the police. in bharthana, party workers were dragged out from their homes, he said. nearer home, the sp president said the closure of all business establishments and even school and colleges was there for all to see. he said the party workers were ruthlessly beaten up here also.
