0,"Byelection results to hit BJP and SP, says Jaiswal","LUCKNOW: The results of the UP by-election are likely to affect adversely both the BJP and the SP as their image takes a beating in the state, UPCC president Shri Prakash Jaiswal told a press conference on Monday.

Jaiswal argued that the Congress had no stakes in the by-elections as â€œnone of the constituencies which went to the polls were the partyâ€™s strongholdsâ€�. Therefore, not much should be read in the defeat, he reasoned. The party, incidentally, put up a miserable performance by losing all seats by wide margins.

However, the party chief sees no cause to worry. In Akbarpur the party candidate Raj Bahadur polled the same number of votes as Mataprasad during the assembly elections while in Jehangirganj the party actually improved its performance as the candidate polled 8000 voters as against the 2000 votes the party got last time, he pointed.

However, the result in Baheri Vidhan Sabha constituency deserves to be analysed as it had been totally unexpected, said Jaiswal. Interestingly, the Congress president, while taking on the responsibility of the poor show put up by the party refused to analyse its causes. Admitting that â€œthere was a need to pinpoint why the party could not improve its performanceâ€�, he said the party would soon organise a â€œchintan shivirâ€� to mull over the issue.

One of the reasons of the poor performance was the rampant casteism in the state which had gained strength during the last 20 years, he said. â€œAs a result, though the masses have begun to empathise with the Congress they are too scared to come out openly in our support. The caste polarisation has dealt a grave blow to the party,â€� he claimed.

Jaiswal also said that more than 50 per cent of the senior leaders who had campaigned for the party candidates during the by- elections had carried out their job faithfully. About the rest, he would soon submit a report to the party high command, he declared.

1,CM hailed for rolling back Rajnath’s policy,"LUCKNOW: Congratulating chief minister Mayawati on reversal of Rajnath Singhâ€™s quota-within-quota policy, former minister Ashok Yadav has offered â€˜conditionalâ€™ withdrawal of the case in the Supreme Court.

It was on the case filed by Yadav that the Supreme Court had stayed implementation of the new quota policy introduced by Rajnath Singh government. Talking to Times News Network from Delhi, Yadav advised Mayawati to adopt legal procedures for ending the court battle on quota policy.

â€œThe matter is sub judice and the chief minister should not take any decision unilaterally without intimating the apex court,â€� he said adding that he might withdraw the case if the government filed an affidavit saying that the old policy had been adopted again after scrapping Rajnath Singhâ€™s new quota policy.

Sacked by Rajnath Singh from his cabinet, Yadav claimed that the Mayawatiâ€™s decision might not see light of the day till he was requested not to pursue the case and withdraw it in the interest of backwards and dalits.

The former minister pointed out that Mayawati had changed her stand from time to time on the new reservation policy and it was appropriate for her now to make her governmentâ€™s stand clear once for all.

â€œShe had sacked Barkhu Ram Verma and RK Chowdhury on the issue and even dared Rajnath to sack me on quota issue. Then, within days, she had changed her stand and supported Rajnathâ€™s new quota policy,â€� he recalled.

Meanwhile, the Mayawati government has dropped broad hints that it may not pursue the case in the apex court as the same would become â€˜infructuousâ€™ after the old policy is enforced.

Principal secretary, law department, NK Mehrotra told TNN that the proceedings in the case would now depend on what course of action was taken by Ashok Yadav who had filed the petition. â€œThe state government will pursue the case only if Yadav pursues the case,â€� he said hinting that there was nothing in the case now after the old policy was adopted again.

2,Mayawati leaves BJP ministers red-faced,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawatiâ€™s statement on Monday explaining the reasons for reversal of Rajnath Singhâ€™s quota within quota policy has left three important BJP leaders, who are also ministers in the coalition, red-faced.

Mayawati sought to emphasise that the issue was discussed in the Cabinet meeting and the decision to reverse the policy was taken with the consent of Lalji Tandon, Om Prakash Singh and Hukum Singh, who was also chairman of the Social Justice Committee.

Exposing BJPâ€™s internal bickerings, she dwelt at length on how Om Prakash Singh, had persuaded her for policy reversal even if it annoyed the former chief minister.

She also elaborated how Lalji Tandon and Hukum Singh had approved of her decision.

Rajnath Singh, who is now BJPâ€™s UP incharge, has not taken very kindly to Mayawatiâ€™s move and utterances. â€œI will talk to party leaders and seek clarification about the circumstances under which the decision (to reverse his governmentâ€™s policy) was taken,â€� he told TNN.

A visibly upset Rajnath claimed that his government had introduced the new policy to fix quota within quota on the recommendation of the Social Justice Committee.

â€œInjustice was meted out to the most backwards and the most oppressed among Dalits as they were denied reservations. In the new policy a separate quota was fixed for them to extend the reservation benefits,â€� he said justifying his governmentâ€™s decision to change the new policy.

Urban development minister Lalji Tandon sounded annoyed with Mayawatiâ€™s public statement. â€œShe is in a habit of unnecessarily complicating things. If there was any confusion, it could have been sorted out through talks. Why take things to the media and public?,â€� he asked.

Contradicting Mayawatiâ€™s story, Tandon claimed that it was Mayawati who had telephoned him saying that the Supreme Courtâ€™s stay on the new quota policy was causing difficulties and it would be appropriate to implement the old policy till the apex court verdict was delivered.

â€œTrue it was in Saturdayâ€™s Cabinet agenda but we gave the approval only for making a stop-gap arrangement and not to reverse Rajnath Singhâ€™s policy,â€� Tandon clarifed pointing out that Mayawati had also supported the new policy when BJP had no coalition with the BSP. But what has caused more concern among senior BJP leaders is her attempt to alienate Rajanth Singh by creating bad blood within the partyâ€™s top leadership in the state.

Irrigation minister Om Prakash Singh said, â€œI am bound by the oath of secrecy so I would not comment on what the chief minister has said. But she should not have taken the discussion within the Cabinet to the public,â€� he added. Like Tandon he also said that they had not approved reversal of the policy but favoured it as a temporary arrangement.

3,2 murders in Vasant Kunj farmhouse,"NEW DELHI: A businessman and his domestic help were found murdered in the formerâ€™s Vasant Kunj farmhouse on Monday morning. Police officials said Kishan Lal Khurana (68) and Santosh (23) were hacked to death with an axe.

While Khuranaâ€™s body was found in the garden of the farmhouse (5, Ram Mandir Marg, Vasant Kunj), Santosh was found inside a room. ""The victims had been hit repeatedly with the axe. There are multiple injuries on their necks and head,"" said a police officer. The bodies were reportedly found at about 10 am by some of Khuranaâ€™s employees. ""The victim ran a small tours and travel business from within the farmhouse where he was also lived. When the employees reached the office in the morning, they could not locate Khurana. It was not long before they spotted the body in the garden and informed the police,"" said the officer.

Khurana was found in a t-shirt, shorts and a pair of sports shoes. Police officials said this would suggest that he had stepped out for a walk when he was attacked. The time of death is being said to be about 5 am, as Khurana usually went for his morning walk about that time.

The assailants also ransacked the house. They apparently went through all the rooms. The television in one of the rooms was found smashed as was a computer. Though this would suggest the assailants had murdered the businessman and his servant while committing a robbery, police officials said they had not arrived at a conclusion yet.

It is also not clear whether the assailants stole anything or not. ""Khuranaâ€™s elder son is in the US. His wife, younger son, Sanjeev, daughter-in-law and grandchildren recently left for the US on a holiday.

It seems the assailants knew this and struck when only the elderly man and his servant were at home,"" the officer said.

Officials said Khuranaâ€™s two guard dogs, both German Shepherds, were found locked in a room. They suspect that someone known to the dogs, like a previous employee, may be involved in the murder which can explain why the dogs did not attack Khuranaâ€™s killers.

Preliminary inquiries have revealed that Khurana had several servants and employees working for him. The police is now questioning many of them and trying to trace others.

The Vasant Kunj police have registered a case of murder and are investigating the matter.

4,Mayawati changes employment policy,"LUCKNOW: On the completion of her one month in office, chief minister Mayawati on Monday justified the decision to reverse Rajnath Singhâ€™s â€œati-pichhda and ati-Dalitâ€� (most backward and most Dalit) concept in reservation and replace it with the old quota system of 1994.

Mayawati told newsmen that she had consulted the BJP ministers Om Prakash Singh and Hukum Singh on it. She said that before taking the new quota policy to the cabinet, there were discussions also with ministers like Lalji Tandon and others.â€� She said that ministers like Om Prakash Singh and Hukum Singh Singh had advised her to reintroduce the old reservation policy, rescinding Rajnath Singhâ€™s quota system.

Recalling the consultations that took place prior to the reversal of the reservation policy of her predecessor, the chief minister said that urban development minister Tandon had â€˜asked me to go ahead after seeking legal opinion from the advocate-general of Uttar Pradeshâ€™.

She said introduction of the new policy was essential because the Supreme Court had stayed the bifurcation of jobs for Dalits and ati-Dalits on the one hand and ati-pichhda and pichhda on the other. This was depriving Dalit children from availing the benefits of quota in admissions in colleges, said the chief minister.

As the case relating to quota within quota was still pending before the Supreme Court, she said that the government would put up its view before the court forcefully.

When reminded by newsmen about her commitment to honour the decisions taken by the Rajnath Singh government, she simply said that she had altered the decision for the welfare of Dalits and backwards.

Commenting on the bypoll results, she said that the Samajwadi Partyâ€™s propaganda that BSP had forfeited the support of Muslims by joining hands with the BJP had been nailed. The victory of the BSP candidate from the Baheri vidhan sabha seat had exposed Mulayamâ€™s tenuous hold on Muslims, said the chief minister. On Congress candidatesâ€™ performance at the bypoll, she said the party had no support but its leaders always talked big.

On Ayodhya she said she was keeping a tab on the situation and would not hesitate in taking appropriate steps if necessary.

5,Councillors protest high crime rate,"SALT LAKE: Security in Salt Lake is becoming a serious cause for concern.

Trinamul Congress councillors, mostly women, marched to the North 24 Parganas police station on Monday to protest against the deteriorating law and order situation.

On Friday evening, 43-year-old Durga Rani Datta had gone to CD block.

There she was accosted by a gang of men who came in an ambassador, hit her on the head with an iron rod, pulled at her sari and snatched her handbag.

The whole thing happened in flash, according to a shell shocked Datta. On hearing her cries, local residents rushed her to a hospital.

Datta later lodged a complaint with the north Bidhannagar police station.

SDPO Sujay Chanda visited Datta and assured her that the guilty would be punished.

â€œThere is complete breakdown of law and order in Salt Lake, the number of cases of snatching is increasing, motor bike thefts take place in broad daylight and the police have failed to control crime,â€� ward 8 councillor Debashish Jana.

Recently, Salt Lake was divided into three security zones and police patrolling stepped up. But this has not improved the situation.

6,"CPI protests petrol, diesel price hike","HYDERABAD: Members of the Communist Party of India burnt the effigy of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to protest the hike in petrol and diesel prices here at Narayanguda crossroads on Monday.

According to CPI State secretariat member Aziz Pasha and city council secretary V Ramnarasimha Rao, who led the protests, the hike in petroleum prices would ultimately lead to an increase in the rates of essential commodities.

The leaders flayed the hike and termed it a hasty decision. They also demanded an immediate withdrawal of the hike. All India Student Federation (AISF) and All India Youth Federation (AIYF) also participated in the protest.

7,NGO 'adopts' temples sans govt nod,"HYDERABAD: The state government has not accorded permission to Mother India Earth Campaign (MIEC), a non-governmental organisation, to adopt 23 historical temples located across the state including Chilkoor Balaji temple and collect donations, as claimed by it, for their development.

The MIEC is allegedly collecting donations for renovation of temples using the names of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, endowments commissioner Ajay Kallam and Hyderabad district collector Rajeshwar Tiwari. The endowments department will lodge a complaint with the police in a day or two against MIEC and its founder president B V Rama Rao for collecting donations illegally.

Endowments commissioner Ajay Kallam on Monday told The Times of India that the department would lodge a complaint against MIEC and Rama Rao for misleading the people regarding templesâ€™ adoption and donations. According to him, the MIEC was not authorised to collect any donations for the development of the temples.

MIEC has been claiming that it was granted government permission to develop 23 temples, including Gnana Saraswati temple at Basar, Balabrahmeswara Swamy temple (Sri Jogulamba Ammavari Devasthanam) at Alampur in Mahboobnagar district and Jhamsingh Balaji Venkateswara Swamy temple located at Gudimalkapur in Hyderabad.

When asked about the photographs of Naidu and others being used in the brochures released by the MIEC, Ajay Kallam said that he was only shown the brochure which spoke about the programmes to be undertaken by the MIEC for rural development. The brochure did not contain any information about the temples adoption, he said. MIEC also released brochures which in a veiled manner say that it had the blessings of the chief minister.

One of the brochure reads: â€œWith the blessings of Lord Sri Venkateshwara Chilkoor... Creator of Swarnandhrapradesh... Mother India Earth Campaign,â€™â€™ with a photograph of Chandrababu Naidu. MIEC has been collecting donations promising that it would provide drinking water, approach roads, choultries, guest houses, queue complexes in temples, and start veda patashalas and old-age homes.

The voluntary body has sought donations in the categories of Rs 1,00,116 (maharaja poshakulu), Rs 50,116 (raja poshakulu), Rs 25,116 (poshakulu), Rs 10,116 (daatalu). At a recent press conference held here, Rama Rao also displayed for the media list of donations received in the form of cheques.

However, when contacted on Monday, Rama Rao claimed that the government had accorded him permission to adopt the temples. â€œHow can you think that we will go ahead with this project without the governmentâ€™s permission,â€™â€™ he asked.

8,Vehicle owners protest fuel hike,"MUMBAI: For vehicle owners in the city, the volatile nature of fuel is no longer the only bother. ``Currency notes in my wallet will now disappear faster than the rate at which petrol evaporates,'''' said an angry car owner reacting to the fuel hike on Monday.

With petroleum minister Ram Naik announcing the increase on Monday, Mumbaikars will now have to pay Rs 33.47 for a litre of petrol instead of the Rs 30.78 they paid earlier. Diesel will cost Rs 22.85, up from Rs 21.10 per litre.

The increase came into effect from midnight. A number of motorists rushed to petrol pumps on Monday evening to fill up their tanks only to find that fuel stations had downed their shutters, anticipating the rush.

Naresh Pai, a motorist travelling from Ville Parel to Mahim, complained that at least four petrol stations refused to fill his car. ``I even offered to pay them the higher rates but they turned me away stating that they were out of fuel,'''' he said.

Said Sunil Merchant of the Western India Automobile Association, ``The price hike has come at the most unfortunate time when war clouds are hovering over our border.'''' Car owners will now be forced to make fewer trips, but the spiral effect on transport, cargo rates and food prices will pinch everybody, he said.

A.L. Quadros of the Bombay Taximen''s Union ruled out a fare increase. ``Nearly 30,000 taxis running on compressed natural gas (CNG) will not be affected by the hike thus we cannot change the fare structure,'''' he said. The 15,000 taxis running on diesel and 3,000 taxis on petrol are expected to convert to CNG by the end of the year, he said.

The Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking also said that the price increase was unfortunate. ``A hike of a rupee in diesel prices translates into an additional burden of Rs 10 crore,'''' a BEST source said.

9,BMC plans to increase water rates,"MUMBAI: Slum-dwellers would have to pay almost twice the rate for water whereas the proposed hike for flat-owners is likely to be around 33 per cent.

The new rates were proposed by municipal commissioner K.C. Srivastava who presented the civic budget for 2002-''03 before the standing committee on Monday. The standing committee will pass the budget with or without amendments, after which the proposal will be put to vote in the civic house.

However, water tax for industrial users will not be hiked. ``The corporation does not want industries to leave Mumbai,'''' the commissioner said.

The increase in water taxes is part of the civic administration''s plan to reduce its deficit from Rs 117 crore to Rs 68 crore. The hike in water tax alone will boost the BMC''s revenue by Rs 115 crore.

Water charges for slum-dwellers are proposed to be increased from Rs 1.75 per 1,000 litres to Rs 3 per 1,000 litres whereas the charges of water in the domestic category would increase from Rs 3 per 1,000 litres to Rs 4 per 1,000 litres. The commissioner justified the hike saying that water was already being supplied at highly subsidised rates.

For the first time in BMC''s history, the budget was presented showing a deficit estimate at the year-end, violating section 126 of the Act which stipulates that there should be a surplus cash balance of not less than Rs one lakh at the close of the financial year. However, Mr Srivastava boldly estimates a deficit of Rs 68 crore for the year 2002-2003.

He reasoned that, `` Over the years we could not maintain the estimates of a surplus budget and this was nothing but a violation of the law. We were inflating the estimated income, which was unachievable, just to present a surplus budget.''''

Though a hike in octroi tax is not proposed in his budget, the commissioner has suggested to the standing committee that it consider increasing octroi on most of the goods. Mr Srivatsava said, he would submit a separate proposal to the standing committee and corporation in July-August for the sanction of the hike on octroi.

The commissioner has proposed an increase in tax on all kinds of goods except those scheduled under groups A and E. Edible items that ar perishable, liquor, alcohol and cigarettes are some of the goods which come under these groups.

But goods on which the commissioner plans to levy higher taxes, include dry fruits, pickle, biscuits, honey, washing soap, tooth paste, cutlery and crockery items, footwear, computers, spices, all types of cloth, newsprint, sugar, silvers items and diamonds.

10,Two killed in separate incidents,"PATNA: Two persons were killed in separate incidents in the state capital on Monday morning while S K Puri police caught two criminals while they were fleeing after snatching a bag containing Rs 5,000 from Maa Bhagwati complex.

One Bijay Kumar, a resident of Lohanipur, after alighting from a train was going home on a jeep when some unidentified persons stopped his vehicle at the Bhattacharya intersection around 5 am and fired shots killing him on the spot. The body remained unattended for over an hour when some passersby noticed the victim in a pool of blood.

Thinking it was an accident, he was taken to the traffic police station which took the body for autopsy to the PMCH. The Gandhi Maidan police feigned ignorance about the incident but a traffic constable confirmed it was a case of murder.

The second killing took place on Monday morning in Indira Nagar under the Jakkanpur police station where one Ajit Kumar was shot dead. He resides in a lodge and police suspect that it was a case of personal enmity.

Snatching case: DSP (probationer) Rakesh Dubey and sub-inspector R K Tiwari of the S K Puri police station caught Dilip and Amit while they were escaping after snatching a bag containing cash from Rajesh Kumar from Maa Bhagwati premises around 12 noon.

Three countrymade pistols, small quantity of gun powder besides cartridges of .22 and .315 bores were also seized. Dilip is a salesman while Amit is the son of a clerk.

Road blocked: Tension prevailed in Rajiv Nagar after tea stall owners and hawkers blocked the road and pelted stones following removal of a tea-stall installed on the land of one Raja Ram. Witnesses said that Raja Ram demolished the shop after his persuasion failed to elicit any result.

He stressed the point that parity should begin at home.

14,Students to take out rally in Vadodara,"VADODARA: Students of HSC science stream and their parents would take out a rally on Wednesday to demand a re-valuation of answer papers and protest against the ''unfair'' assessment of answer papers. The rally would start from Badambdi baug at 1.30 pm and end at the district collectorate where a delegation would submit a memorandum to the collector. The association of parents and students has also planned to file a public interest litigation seeking re-valuation of the papers.

Member of the municipal school board Narendra Tiwari said the parents say the HSC exams held here in the second phase were unfair to the students as the question papers were difficult as compared to the earlier exams in the first phase.

""There are also cases where students have received less than 15 marks while in preliminary exams they received 95 marks in the same subject. There are more than just a few cases where students suspect that the paper correction is not done efficiently and thus even good students have come out with poor results,"" he said.

According to him if the government does not take appropriate action the agitation would be intensified.

15,Trinamul to protest petro hike,"KOLKATA: In keeping with its earlier anti-NDA stand on important economic issues, the Trinamul Congress announced on Tuesday that it was against the hike in the prices of petrol and diesel that came into force on Monday night.

Trinamul spokesman Pankaj Banerjee told the media that such measures would put pressure on the common people. He claimed the hike was much more than adequate. The party has sought central intervention so that the petroleum ministry reconsiders its decision. â€œWe feel that the hike has been more than what was needed. If the central government does not take our views into account, we will have no option but to go in for an agitation,â€� warned Banerjee. The Trinamul Congress Parliamentary Party would meet on the issue after the June 7 Bangla Bandh.

Meanwhile, MP and convener of the Trinamul Congress Krishak Sabha Ananda Mohan Biswas castigated the state government for failing to ensure minimum support price for the stateâ€™s paddy farmers.

He even pointed out that the stateâ€™s farmers had to face a loss of Rs 3,000 crore after the floods in 2000 as the state government had failed to bring the farmers under crop insurance. Biswas threatened to call another bandh to highlight the failure of the state .

16,CPI council flays state agro policy,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjeeâ€™s pet agricultural policy received scathing criticism at the recently concluded state council meeting of the CPI. The party alleged during the meeting that the policy had been designed by multinationals and said that if implemented, it would lead to complete reversal of the Frontâ€™s 25 year old, pro-poor agro-policy.

During the three-day meetings of the state executive committee and the state council of the CPI, which ended in Kolkata on Sunday, senior party leaders also observed that the new policies of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on labour, health and education were against interests of the common people and would isolate the Left Front.

â€œAll the policies are being drafted by the CPM without discussing them with the other Front partners. These are anti-people policies. Yet we, as Front partners, have to share the blame for mistakes committed by the CPM,â€� a senior CPI leader told TNN on Tuesday.

The party also decided to call an emergency meeting of the state council - second time in a month - to identify specific areas of differences with the government policies and prepare a note for distribution inside the party. A second note would be sent to the government and the Left Front.

â€œIt will not be wise to quit the Left Front at this stage. Rather, given the national political scenario, a stronger unity of the Left is required. But we cannot accept the policies being adopted by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, which are no different from those of the Centre. We will have to go public and criticize them, â€œ the CPI leader said. â€œFor example, we will not accept Buddhadeb Bhattacharjeeâ€™s agricultural policy which was framed by multinationals. We will oppose it publicly,â€� he said.

At a press conference held during the day, CPI state secretary Manju Kumer Majumdar criticised the state government for failing to buy provide minimum support price for the paddy growers of the state which led to large-scale distress sale. â€œThe chief minister has said that the government does not have adequate funds to procure paddy. We want to know why the governmentâ€™s coffers went empty,â€� Majumdar said.
