0,"Govt gives election sop, announces bonus","GANDHINAGAR: With an expectation that the Election Commission may announce poll dates within a week, Gujarat''s BJP rulers have opted in favour of short-term electoral gain instead of financial prudence.

A top-level meeting held in the Sachivalaya late on Monday decided not to favour the recommendation given by the state finance department against any bonus or festival advance to all categories of government employees.

The state finance department had warned of ""severe financial implications"" if bonus was paid, saying it would mean an extra burden of Rs 125 crore during the current financial year.

Setting aside the finance department view â€” according to which the state coffers'' delicate funds position would be get impaired in case bonus and festival advance were given â€” the Gujarat government on Tuesday officially announced the ''Dussehra-Vijaya Dashmi gift'' to government employees.

An official note issued here said, all class three and four employees, including government servants working in panchayats and grant-in-aid institutions, would be given up to Rs 2,500 as bonus ""on the same lines as central government employees."" The payments will be paid made by the month-end or latest by Diwali.

The employees with a basic pay of up to Rs 8,300 would also be given Rs 1,500 as ""festival advance"". Explained a senior official, ""The festival advance is in fact loan at zero per cent interest, recoverable in 10 instalments.""

A total number of 4.5 lakh employees will benefit, even as the state exchequer will receive its first major jolt in the current financial year â€” it will just slip into the red.

""Last year, the state government had given bonus to class four employees, costing the exchequer Rs 25 crore. This despite the state department view against it. This year, the burden, for obvious political considerations, would be Rs 125 crore,"" the official added.

Remarked a top bureaucrat, ""We have been taking the view that financial prudence demands cutting sharply into government expenditure, especially when it is unproductive. A 20 per cent cut into government employees is being implemented, though gradually. The decision on bonus runs counter to this spirit. There is indeed nothing to suggest that the employees have put in any extra work over the one year.""

View is even strong among bureaucrats of the chief minister''s office that 50 per cent of the employees not only do not deserve bonus or festival advance as ""gift"" but can be dispensed with forthwith as part of a scheme to slash expenditure.

Currently, the coffers are in plus, thanks to tight control on expenditure by the finance department. Last week, they were plus by Rs 25 crore. But with the bonus and festival advance to be paid, it will slip into minus by at least Rs 100 crore by the end of this month, Sachivalaya sources predict.

""This will be just the beginning,"" explained a top bureaucrat. ""The bills for all major expenditures on developmental works undertaken by the state government will start in November. Their payments may now be affected.""

1,Former boxer's arrest: Maria rings probe bell,"MUMBAI: Railway police commissioner Rakesh Maria has ordered an inquiry into the arrest of former national level boxer, Aspi Irani (71) following allegations by social activists that he was ill-treated by the police.

They claimed that the police failed to inform his family about his arrest. As a result, he had to languish in the Byculla jail for eight days. The inquiry will be conducted by assistant police commissioner R.M. Pargunde.

Mr Irani was arrested at Mumbai Central station on the morning of September 20 by constable A.D. Shinde for travelling in a ladies compartment. He was produced the next day before a metropolitan magistrate who remanded him to seven days custody. Following Mr Irani''s arrest, his family, which resides in Juhu lane, was completely in the dark about his whereabouts.

Mr Irani was in a state of shock and kept mum about his arrest for several days after his release from jail and his family refused to speak to this newspaper.

Social activists, who assisted the Irani family in tracing him, have accused the police of not informing the family about Mr Irani''s arrest and subsequent custody. Said activist Mehernosh Fitter, ""The family underwent a traumatic experience. They stayed awake at nights and his daughters even skipped work for few days hoping they would receive a call about their father''s whereabouts.""

Mr Fitter said he had accompanied Mr Irani''s daughters to police stations throughout the city and complaints were lodged at the D N Nagar and D B Marg police stations. The family members even contacted the morgues, he said.

""What the police did was not right. They should have been able to trace the family as the information had been passed to a number of police stations"", said another activist Maharukh Noble.

Mr Fitter alleged that Mr Irani was not given food and water and was not provided proper medical treatment. The police denied the charge stating that Mr Irani underwent medical tests on the very day he was arrested.

Mr Irani used to visit friends at Balaram Street, Grant Road, everyday and would return home after two hours. On September 20 he left home for Grant Road, but this time though, the homebound journey was not quite as planned.

Mr Irani boarded a second class ladies compartment and was arrested at Mumbai Central station by the constable, who booked him under section 162 of the Indian Railway Act. The Act provides for a fine of Rs 500 or imprisonment of seven days. As Mr Irani was unable to pay the fine he was produced before the metropolitan magistrate the next day and remanded to seven days custody.

Mr Maria claimed that Mr Irani failed to give a proper address or a telephone number to the police. Mr Irani''s address in the police register mentions his address as â€˜Aradhana building, Naka, Mumbai.'' ""How do we inform anyone if a person refuses to give the correct address?"" he asked.

According to Mr Maria, 21 persons were arrested at Mumbai Central for travelling in the ladies compartment on September 20. Of these, 11 of them called their homes or friends and were released after paying the fine. But ten others, including Mr Irani failed to do so.

The police claimed that some of the offenders do not wish to call their homes out of shame.The following day some of the ten accused paid up the fines when produced before a magistrate. It is not known why the others failed to inform their near and dear. ""If the police prevented Mr Irani from making a phone call, what prevented him from informing the magistrate?"" Mr Maria asked.

According to him, Mr Irani did not say anything to the magistrate. Further, the responsibility of the police ended after a remand for judicial custody is obtained.

The police will now record Mr Irani''s statement and those of the other offenders, who were arrested on that day, to find out if any of them faced harassment or were denied access to a phone.

4,Bal Thackeray slams divestment policy,"MUMBAI: The Centre''s disinvestment policy has degenerated into a fast-buck business, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said on Tuesday.

He was addressing the Sena''s annual Dasera rally at the Shivaji Park grounds.

Mr Thackeray cited the recent sale of a suburban hotel in Mumbai as a case in point. Owned and managed by the Hotel Corporation of India, the five-star hotel was sold to a private entrepreneur for Rs 83 crore and the entrepreneur made a neat profit by reselling it for Rs 120 crore.

""Disinvestment is fast becoming a â€˜dhandha''. Who wants such tainted money?"" Mr Thackeray asked, adding, We will not allow you to sell the country in the name of disinvestment.You can''t touch the country for quick money.""

Mr Thackeray ridiculed the Centre for not taking effective measures to curb terrorism. ""The Sena is not asking the Centre to start a war with Pakistan. But the Union government can at least tackle Pak-sponsored terrorism within the country. Terrorist camps can be finished and illegal immigrants from Bangladesh can be stopped from entering the country,"" Mr Thackeray said.

""India is weak and feeble. The country is groaning and the situation is worsening.We need a Prime Minister like Margaret Thatcher who, during her tenure as PM, gave a rebuff to Muslims in London.""

Mr Thackeray complimented Tamil Nadu''s chief minister J. Jayalalithaa for her bill on conversion. He said that former J&K chief minister Farooq Abdullah had lost the elections in his state because of ""unbridled arrogance"".

Unprecedented security and the deployment of commandos marked the Sena rally. The podium from which Mr Thackeray addressed the meeting had a special wood enclosure as a security measure.

5,Terrorists asked to incite communal riots in India: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Government has ""information"" on Pakistan-sponsored terrorists being asked to target religious places in India to incite communal riots, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani said on Wednesday.

Advani also asked the world community to realise that ISI is a ""prime source"" of worldwide terrorism like Taliban and al-Qaeda.

Advani was speaking at the 18th Raising Day of the National Security Guards (NSG) popularly known as ''Black Cat Commandos'' here.

""The government has information in general terms that terrorists have been asked to target such places in the country which could incite communal riots and the terrorists had decided to do that,"" he said

Advani also said the ""decent polls"" held in Jammu and Kashmir, despite Pakistan''s attempts to disrupt them, had won respect worldwide. The free and fair elections have further improved India''s image internationally, he noted.

Referring to the terrorist attack on Akshardham temple on September 24, he said he disagreed with a belief held by many that it was targeted because of being a soft target.

""There are a lot of soft targets, like bus stops, where women and children can be killed,"" Advani said.

He said it was attacked to incite communal violence and hailed the people and government of Gujarat for foiling the enemy''s designs.

He said he expected countries using terrorism to pursue their political agenda to be increasingly ostracised and isolated.

9,"‘Badal’s arrest to trigger chakka jams, jail bharo’","PATHANKOT: Tempers are running high in the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) following the reported statement of chief minister Amarinder Singh, indicating the possible arrest of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.The release of former PWD minister Sucha Singh Langah, considered to have a stronghold in Gurdaspur, on bail has also helped the SAD in gearing up their party rank and file.While the Gurdaspur unit of the SAD celebrated Langah's release by distributing laddoos, party workers were also told to brace up for the worst in case Badal got arrested. At a meeting held in Aliwal village in Qadian on Tuesday, SAD workers had taken exception to Amarinder's statement about Badal's arrest. They decided that if Badal got arrested they would court arrest and resort to 'chakka jams' and 'jail bharo andolans'. The Amarinder government would then be held responsible for the consequences, they said.At another meeting held at Chandarbhan village in Dhariwal constituency, SAD workers again distributed laddoos and resolved to take the issue to the streets in case Badal was arrested.Expressing concern over the firing incident in which SGPC member Balwant Singh Dhillon's security guard was killed in Amritsar on Tuesday, SAD leaders said, ''The aim of the assailants was to kill Dhillon. Amarinder Singh, in league with former SGPC chief Gurbachan Singh Tohra, was ''unleashing terror on SAD leaders.Senior Akali leader jathedar Jagtar Singh Gonsal said the government would have to pay a heavy price if Badal got arrested. Accusing Amarinder of creating a fear among Akali Dal leaders by making such statements, he said the chief minister's motive was to put psychological pressure on the SAD so that Tohra could emerge victorious in the SGPC elections.According to political observers, the ''confrontationist stance adopted by the Amarinder government could lead to social turmoil given the volatile nature of Akali politics.

10,Political murder or murder of politics?,"JALANDHAR: The resurfacing divisions and tensions within the Congress, mixed with the emotions of family honour and revenge, culminated in a bloody murder in the city on Tuesday night.After watching Ravana's effigy burn, Jaswinder Singh Judge, 30, and ambitious, was walking back home unaware of his death that was stalking him. Within a few minutes he was slaughtered to death by his political rivals. About that there is little doubt. But the ruthless manner which he was murdered suggests that a number of musclemen were involved, not just Congress councillor Balkrishan Bali and his two sons who have surrendered.Bali, along with his two sons Kakoo and Abhay, surrendered after the rival Congress group put pressure on the police. Bali had left Congress minister Avtar Henry's camp after he was not supported by his political mentor for the mayor's ticket. The Henry camp, by then, had groomed Jaswinder Judge as a strong rival to Bali from ward number 12. This is said to be a strong motive behind the murder.Soon after, clashes started between the two. The murder is being seen as a culmination of this political rivalry. The violence and crowd reaction in the city on Wednesday is believed to have been all planned. By profession Judge happened to be a scooter mechanic, but his main vocation, it is said, was politics.Immediately after the incident, the people of Kishanpura, who seem to understand the politics of the murder, were enraged as they sensed that the police was not taking any action. It took the police more than three hours to react. By then, the angry mob, led by Youth Congress leaders, burnt the shops owned by Bali.On Wednesday morning, too, a number of shops were burnt and Dadar Express was stopped and its driver beaten up. At the Adda Hoshiarpur railway crossing, the police resorted to lathicharge. Fearing reprisals from the violent mob, incited and led by Youth Congress leaders owing allegiance to one of the Congress ministers, the police beefed up security at the minister's office in Dhun Mohalla. Ironically, Congress workers who were part of the mob were raising slogans against the Punjab police. ''We were under pressure to act softly, confessed SSP Paramjit Singh Gill.However, people were all praise for the police for keeping the mobs in check. ''We had reports that there was a plan to spread violence on a large scale in the city, so we prepared ourselves, said the SSP.

11,Punjab govt stops free power to farmers,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has decided to roll back free power to farmers and impose a tariff recommended by the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission PSERC. However, power supply to them will remain highly subsidised. They will have to pay Rs per BHP or 57 paise per unit for metered supply. The proposed tariff without subsidy would have been Rs 2 per unit or Rs 212 per BHP.Addressing a Press conference after the Cabinet's decision on Wednesday, chief minister Amarinder Singh said his government had accepted the PSERC's recommendation in totality.However, he said the government would resume free power supply to farmers once the state's fiscal situation improved. The new tariff would be applicable with immediate effect but it is not clear whether farmers would have to pay arrears from April or August this year.have to confirm the exact date from which the tariff would apply,'' he said. ''We had made an electoral promise to continue free power supply to farmers but the fiscal health of the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) was precarious and the state had no resources to continue it,'' he said adding the choice was between imposing a tariff or going for a complete blackout or ''dark Diwali'' this year.Singh clarified that the PSERC was a statutory body created under an Act of Parliament and enjoyed quasi-judicial status, so the government had no option but to accept its recommendations. He, however, did not explain why the state had been sitting over the recommendations for the past six weeks when it had no authority to modify them.The state government has also decided to reimpose levy on canal water which had been abolished under the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) rule.Though the amount involved is not substantial, the decision had a negative impact on the upkeep of canals and water never reached the tailends because of poor maintenance.Free power for the farm sector was introduced by the SAD-BJP combine government soon after it came to power in February 1997. Our comment Very welcome step, indeed. Other state governments should follow suit, and stand firm in the face of the inevitable populist backlash.

He indicated that Badal's wife Surinder Kaur, too, would meet the same fate, saying, ''All crooks will be booked, irrespective of their gender.He said Sukhbir Badal, son of the former chief minister, too would be put behind bars.

16,It's keyboard pounding time for govt staff,"BANGALORE: It is ``back-to-school'' for the government employees in Karnataka. With e-governance touching every sphere of their work-life, these employees are keeping pace with technology by attending crash courses and learning the nuances of the computer.The Government Computer Centre, isolated a few years ago, now bustles with activity. Virtually every department sends its staff here everyday to study computer fundamentals.``We have employees attending a nine-day course. They come during the office hours for the training. The respective departments send their employees and their training requirements and we train them appropriately,'' Gangadhar N Datanal, senior programmer at the Government Computer Centre, said.From the history of computer to Power-Point presentations to learning to access the Internet, it is a ``back-to-school'' experience for these employees.Take the case of KB Om Prakash, section officer in the Karnataka Legislative Council. In between clearing files, he has to attend computer classes. Same is the case with Hemalatha Suri, auditor, state cooperative audit department, who fits in the computer classes into her busy schedule.``There are employees who have basic knowledge of the computer, but are not conversant with the usage of computers in day-to-day administration. The training is specific to the needs of each department,'' IT director E.V. Ramana Reddy told The Times of India.Interestingly, even employees who are on the verge of retirement are keen on learning computers. ``For some, it is curiosity. But for many, especially those who have put in several years of service, learning computers means avoiding embarrassment with the younger generation. There has been no resistance at all,'' Datanal said.Of the 4,500 odd employees in the state secretariat, over 2,000 have already been trained. Except class IV and drivers, training is given to typists, stenographers, assistant and section officers in various departments.While the government has trained people in all the 175 taluks for the successful implementation of the Bhoomi (computerisation of land records) project, the first phase of training for nearly 800 employees in the state treasury department to implement the `Khajane' project is complete.The second phase for another batch of 800 employees will commence in November, Datanal said.The government spends nearly Rs 40 lakh every year for computer training andthe directorate is expected to spend nearly Rs 50-55 lakh this year, Reddy said.

17,All riot-relief camps to close down from Oct 30,"AHMEDABAD: Eight months after their world turned topsy-turvy on February 28, it's time to go home to an uncertain future for 2,530 inmates of four relief camps that are still functional in the city.Come October 30 and it will be a long-awaited homecoming for inmates of these camps. All the riot-relief camps plan to down shutters and resettle riot-hit to their new homes. But, the homecoming may be one with less cheers and more fears. Most of the inmates are still waiting for their compensation money to come their way. Both organisers of relief camps and the riot-hit inmates complain of unfulfilled dues.I don't know how to live my life after I get out of this camp. My meat shop was looted, my house was burnt down and the government simply refuses to compensate my financial losses that run well over Rs 1.55 lakh. Till date I have only got Rs 2,500, says Adil Abdul Hamid who now stays at the Quresh Jamat Hall at Mirzapur area.Adil Abdul Hamid still shudders from those terrifying memories when he only just managed to escape the marauding packs of rioters on February 28. He then stayed at Jawannagar in Naroda-Patia. For four days he believed that his wife and four-year-old daughter, Aeysha, had been killed by the rioters.By God's grace I was reunited with them at the Dariakhan Ghummat relief camp. Today when it is time restart life, I don't have an accommodation. I think I will have to return to my home town in Maharashtra, lamented Hamid, who is one among the 930 inmates of a relief camp. Organiser of the Quresh Hall camp Ataullah Khan Pathan told TNN: Most of the inmates belong to Gulbarg Society (39 killed) and Naroda-Patia (86 killed) and they do not want to return home. We are holding talks with the district administration for allocation of land to these people in areas like Vatwa and Sarkhej.Twenty-year-old Diwar Firoz Shaikh, who stayed at Santoshben ni Chali opposite the ill-fated Gulbarg Society says: I was set on fire by a mob but I managed to escape and recovered at the Dariakhan Ghummat relief camp. For eight months, we stayed like one large scared family, now it is time to go home but without a paise to restart my life with. I hope NGOs step in to help us out of this situation for the state government has once again failed to deliver the promised goodies.Shift focus to the Haj House relief camp and the mood is much the same. This camp in Kalupur area houses 1,184 inmates who used to reside in areas adjoining Naroda-Patia and Gomtipur. Ayub Khan, organiser of the camp, said: I have submitted report of all the expenditures we have incurred during the past few months. Neither does the district administration respond to this nor makes any effort to help 35 per cent of riot-hit inmates in this camp who are still waiting to get the compensation. They are ready to go back home and I too want to disband the camp on October 30 but the state government machinery does not seem to be interested.Rafiq Shaikh who manages a relief camp at Sayyed Wadi in Khanpur area says: I have got 475 riot-hit people staying here. I have sent a letter to the district administration stating my wish to close operations but they have yet to respond. The fourth relief camp that is ready to down its shutters is at Vatwa where 125 people are housed.A mamlatdar at the Ahmedabad collectorate told TNN: With law and order back to normal, relief camps should close down and help riot-affected go back home.
