0,Power tariff hike sparks protest,"HUBLI: Janata Dal (S) workers burnt the effigy of Chief Minister S.M. Krishna in Hubli on Friday, in protest against the hike in power tariff.

The protesters said the Congress government in the state is increasing the power tariff for the second time after coming to power. ``But no efforts have been made to increase power production in the state. Not a single unit of additional power was generated,'''' they charged.

The JD(S), while demanding the immediate withdrawal of the hike, said ``the farmers and poor sections of society will have bear the burden''''. They threatened to intensify the agitation if the 16.2 per cent hike made by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) is not withdrawn within a week.

1,Medha to join rally against Kudremukh park,"MANGALORE: Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar is visiting Sringeri on Monday to take part in a protest rally against the atrocities committed on tribals and farmers under the purview of Kudremukh National Park.

The rally will also demand the scrapping of the park which will ``displace thousands of tribals'''' from their moorings.

Kalkulli Vittal Hegde, the president, KNP Virodhi Okkoota, told reporters on Friday that Patkar would inaugurate the rally which would demand autonomy to tribals, withdrawal of ``false cases'''' on tribals, and suspension of the deputy conservator of forests who was harassing the Okkoota members.

It will also seek a halt on mining activities of KIOCL and an alternative arrangement of employment for employees, and finally, scrapping of KNP.

Hegde said more than 15,000 tribals and farmers were living under the purview of the park and alleged the park was proposed to displace tribals and sell the world''s richest bio-diversity to the MNCs.

He said that during 2000, the estimated total business in medicinal plants was about Rs 2,25,600 crore and in the next decade, 40 per cent of the world''s economy would be based on products available from the rich bio-diversity found in the developing countries.

``If the park comes into existence, tribals like Gowdlu and Malekudiyas, who constitute 0.4 per cent of the state''s population, would be displaced and would have to live the life of slaves to accommodate the interests of multinationals.''''

He alleged three persons had committed suicide for fear of displacement and the forest department officials were foisting false cases after the final notification of the park to browbeat them into leaving the park.

The rally would be attended by K.T. Gangadhar and H.R. Basavarajappa of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Gowrishankar, administrator of Sringeri Sharada Math, Prof. Chandrashekar Patil of Swabhimani Karnataka Vedike, Sirimane Nagaraj of Bellichukki Book Trust, Sharada, a tribal from KNP, Prof Rajendra Chenni of People''s Union for Civil Liberies (PUCL), Shimoga, Gopal and Shivasundar of Dalit Sangharsha Samithi and B.G. Krishnamurthy from the Okkoota.

The Okkoota has organised a seminar at GSB Hall at Sringeri on May 14, where Pro.f Rajendra Chenni of PUCL, Shimoga, will speak on `National Parks and Human Rights Violation'', and B G Krishnamurthy on `KNP: Why the opposition and how?'' in the morning session.

Shivasundar will speak on `National Parks and vested interests of MNCs'' and Prof. Ravivarma Kumar, advocate, on `Centre''s anti-tribal policies and tribals'' agitation'' in the afternoon session.

2,LeT for recruitment in riot-torn Guj,"NEW DELHI: The two Pakistan-trained Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militants gunned down near Humayunâ€™s Tomb on Thursday night along with their three accomplices had been tasked to recruit youths from the minority community in Gujarat for militant

activity.

The three Jammu and Kashmir-based terrorists â€” Sheikh Sajjad, Firoz Ahmed Sheikh and Mirajuddin Peer alias Hilal â€” arrested by the police had planned to fan out in the riot-hit state posing as human rights activists and inciting communal hatred.

This was, incidentally, the first arrest made by the Delhi police under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota).

DCP special cell Ashok Chand said: â€˜â€˜Fake identity cards of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) were recovered from the arrested militants.â€™â€™

Initial interrogation of the terrorists revealed they had plans to assassinate VIPs, including the Prime Minister and the Union home minister. Planting bombs at key industrial installations including oil pipelines was also on their agenda, Chand said.

The two militants killed in Thursdayâ€™s encounter were identified as Abu Bilal and Abu Zabiullah. Both were Pakistani nationals. The police claimed Bilal was involved in the Red Fort shoot-out in December 2000. He had tried to apply for an Indian passport using forged documents before he was forced to flee from his hideout in Okhla in 2000.

The encounter followed a tip-off that there was a possibility of some terrorists arriving at Nizamuddin railway station to meet some contacts.

They were suspected to be carrying the deadly research developed explosive (RDX) and AK-47 automatic weapons. Chand said when the three J&K-based terrorists were nabbed at the station, they told the police that two of their Pakistani contacts were waiting to receive the explosives near Humayunâ€™s Tomb.

Three arrested militants were remanded to 14 days in police custody by a special court on

Friday.

6,Modi's second bid to mollify ministers fails,"GANDHINAGAR: Rattled by the sharp criticism he faced at Wednesday morning''s Cabinet meeting over the prevailing situation in Gujarat, Chief Minister Narendra Modi called senior Cabinet ministers the same evening at his residence in a frantic exercise to cool down tempers. The meeting did take place, but with two senior ministers abstaining, apparently in protest. At least three others again registered their opposition to administrative mishandling of the communal situation.

The two ministers who abstained were industries minister and No. 2 in the Cabinet Suresh Mehta and water resources minister Narottam Patel. ""Mehta was unhappy with the rather unpredictable and tough manners of Modi during the morning meeting,"" said an insider. As for Narottam, it was suspected, he did not attend as Modi had expressed his displeasure over Narottam''s mentor Union textile minister Kashiram Rana calling the riots a blot on the BJP in the Rajya Sabha debate.

Cabinet spokesperson Purshottam Rupala, considered close to Mehta, also did not turn up but ministers did not read much meaning in it saying ""perhaps he had some important work"". Lately, he has emerged as the most powerful person, next only to Modi, in the Cabinet.

Ministers of state, who were kept out of the meeting by Modi, expressed their unhappiness over the way in which Modi was seeking to ""sideline"" them. ""We should have been called. Was our view not important? We could have discussed the situation in greater length,"" said an MoS.

""The issues discussed included the failure of the police to deal with the communal situation in Ahmedabad; how to cope with the deteriorating image of the state BJP because of the failure; and what powers are to be given to KPS Gill, made security adviser to the CM,"" the Cabinet minister said.

Those who spoke included social justice minister Fakirbhai Vaghela, health minister Ashok Bhatt and energy minister Kaushik Patel, who insisted that combing operations be done as the first confidence-building step. ""Initially, called to woo ministers, the meeting turned into a forum for criticism of the administration under Modi,"" the minister said.

A Gujarat government official note on Thursday sought to deny the news report published in several dailies that any heated exchange took place at the Wednesday morning meeting. But it admitted, ""The Cabinet is the platform where all policy matters are discussed. There was also a discussion on the current situation.""

The second Cabinet meeting on the same day - an unprecedented event in several years - took place even as clear indications emerged that differences between the CM and state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana reached a new level on Thursday.

The chief minister on Wednesday met former RJP leader Dattaji Chiranjit, who had quit the BJP along with Shankarsinh Vaghela, in an attempt to woo him back into party fold.

""The meeting took place in the presence of state food and civil supplies minister Bharat Barot despite Rana''s clear-cut instructions that no person from the RJP will be allowed back in the party,"" said a senior minister. Earlier, Modi met another former RJP leader, Narsinh Padhiar, in an attempt to induct him into the party, inviting Rana''s ire in the process.

7,"Dip in sales tax not due to riots, says state FM","GANDHINAGAR: Officially admitting that the sales tax (ST) income to the Gujarat government has gone down from Rs 5,963 crore in 2000-01 to Rs 5,749 crore in 2001-02, state finance minister Nitin Patel claimed here on Thursday that this was ""not on account of the communal disturbances."" Pointing out the ST incomes went down by 3.39 per cent - for the first time in Gujarat, which has been registering a rise of about 10 per cent annually - Nitin said, ""This is mainly because of recession. The impact of the riots would be known in the sales tax incomes April onwards.""

Talking with newspersons here, Nitin said, ""The recessionary impact on ST incomes have got reinforced by the central government decision to allow ST exemption to Reliance''s petrochemicals plant in Jamnagar for its sales to Indian Oil. The incentive allowed would be on a sale of Rs 14,000 crore and for up to Rs 2,500 crore of ST."" He added, ""We have represented to the Union petroleum ministry to ask Indian Oil to buy only a certain amount of product from Reliance each year.""

The ST from petroleum products sold by four companies to Indian Oil depends directly on the amount the latter buys from Reliance in Gujarat. ""The more it buys from Reliance, less would be the ST for that year"", said Nitin. The ST on petrol is 24 per cent plus a cess of two per cent, while that on diesel it is 21.6 per cent. ""Because of the entry of Reliance, the total amount received by the state from ST on petroleum products is down from Rs 2,105 crore to Rs 1,786 crore in a year"", he added.

Pointing out that the ST exemption to Reliance - an incentive given to it to set up its plant in Jamanagar - would continue for ""at least seven or eight years"", Nitin said, ""Its total loss on account of the incentive to Reliance is up from Rs 384.82 crore to Rs 415.95 crore in a year."" He added, however, ""There is no question of asking the Centre to stop the exemption. It is because of the exemption alone that the plant is in Gujarat. We only want Reliance to stagger its yearly sales.""

8,HC issues notices to govt for CBI probe,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat High Court has issued notices to the state government and deputy commissioner of police Zone-V to show cause as to why a petition, alleging involvement of police in burning of hutments at Gomtipur and seeking transfer of the case to the Central Bueau of Investigation should not be admitted.

The notices were issued by Justice DP Buch in the special criminal application filed by Mohan Bundela of Jansangharsh Manch praying for the transfer of the investigations of the riot case from the DCP Zone V to the CBI.

The court also issued notices as to the interim relief whereby it has been prayed that the accused PSI Modi of the Gomtipur police station be suspended during the investigation.

The petition was directed against the alleged refusal by DCP to investigate the FIR filed on April 10, despite the court order, in connection with the arson, looting and burning of around 260 hutments by a mob, aided and abetted by the accsued PSI on March 1.

It was prayed for the relief that the investigation be transferred to the CBI as the state police failed to perform their duty.

It was submitted that at around noon Gomtipur PSI came in a jeep GJI-AR-5342 along with a few plain-clothes men and parked the jeep in front of the gate of Ambica Mill No.1. A few minutes later, a mob came out from the narrow lane of the Driver''s colony falling in the Amraiwadi Police Station area across the main road of the Khokhra.

The petitioner, who was right on the spot, noticed a few people carrying empty plastic bottles wearing saffron head-bands, came to the police jeep. In the presence of the policemen, including PSI Modi, they took out fuel from the jeep.

A little later another mob came from under the Kokhra overbridge along the railway track and as if on cue, the other mob which was near the police jeep, also converged on the hutments and the used the fuel to burn hutments. The hutment dwellers ran all along the railway line to Kalupur railway station.

The petitioner had moved HC earlier, for registration of the complaint dated March 7, as the police refused to register it. He submits that on April 10, the additional advocate general who had appeared in the matter on behalf of the State has stated before the Court that the complaint could be treated as an FIR and the DCP would investigate the matter. The police had then registered a complaint.

Submitting that he has been threatened for having registered the FIR, petitioner claimed that his makeshift office was attacked around 4.30 pm on April 21, by a mob allegedly instigated by the respondent to terrorise the petitioner so that he does not pursue his earlier complaint.

The petitioner had therefore contended that under this severe biased attitude of the local police, he had no trust in the local policemen and directions were required from the HC to the CBI to investigate the complaint filed by the petitioner to punish the culprits.

9,"Modi 'manages' ministers, cancels meet","GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister Narendra Modi cancelled a crucial meeting he was to take on Friday with the managers of 10 relief camps of Ahmedabad, as he was busy appeasing ministers who are disillusioned with the handling of riots.

Modi, prior to his proposed visit to Ahmedabad for the meeting, met water resources minister Narottam Patel and finance minister Nitin Patel. The meeting lasted for nearly two hours. This was an attempt to ''manage'' the increasing discontent within the Cabinet in view of the continuing violence.

Modi has had to face criticism from his ministerial colleagues at the last two Cabinet meetings. He is also worried about the movements of industry minister Suresh Mehta, who reportedly met some central BJP leaders in New Delhi on Friday. Though he is known to have turned a more vocal critic of the CM of late, the purpose of his visit is still not known.

A senior bureaucrat at the CM''s office, however, sought to explain that the meeting with relief camp managers had to be cancelled ""because of the sudden deterioration of the law and order situation"". However, the home department said no meeting on law and order took place on Friday.

Though he has been informally in touch with camp managers, this was going to be the CM''s first formal meeting with those running Muslim camps. Ever since the riots broke out 10 weeks ago, he has visited only one Muslim camp at the Shah-e-Alam Roza on April 4 and that too with Prime Minister Vajpayee.

Camp managers, too, were puzzled by the suddenness with which the meeting was cancelled. Till 5 pm, the CMO still refused to say the meeting would not take place. But the camp managers were told that it was being cancelled as the CM was busy.

Nitin Patel told TNN that he had discussed ''departmental issues'' with Modi but refused to reveal which ones. Narottam, at a hurriedly called news conference, sought to deny he was one of the discontented ministers. Clarifying why he did not attend the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Narottam said, ""It was not a boycott. I was away for a religious function in village Gangeth in Mehsana district. I had postponed it thrice. I did not want to postpone it again.""

10,Quota issue delays mayor polls,"PATNA: The final constitution of the governing bodies of the municipal corporations of Patna, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Bhagalpur has received a temporary setback with the state government remaining silent on the issue of reservation of the posts of mayors and deputy mayors for women and scheduled castes (SCs) though the State Election Commission (SEC) had asked it about four months ago to take a decision in this regard.

According to SEC sources, the government has not yet taken any decision regarding the implementation of the policy of reservation for women and SCs in the elections to be held for the posts of mayors and deputy mayors of all the five municipal corporations. â€œOur role is just to point this out. We are only policy implementing authority,â€� said SEC secretary Suman Kumar.

To a question, Kumar said the SEC has already written a letter to the urban development department seeking its decision regarding the implementation of the reservation policy, adding that his office is yet to get any reply in this regard from the department. He, however, refused to comment on the delay on the part of the department in taking such a decision.

The elections for the five municipal corporations are being held after a gap of about 18 years. And in the local bodies polls the reservation policy has come into force for the first time.

Kumar, however, said the government has already communicated its decision to the SEC for implementation of the reservation policy in the election of the presidents of various nagar parishads and nagar panchayats in the state. â€œThe process is on for reserving the posts of the presidents of different local bodies for women and SCs in keeping with the reservation policy,â€� he maintained.

When contacted, joint secretary of the urban development department A K Singh said: â€œThe matter is under serious consideration of the authorities concerned, and a decision will be taken soonâ€�.

11,HC quashes minister's appointment,"RANCHI: The Jharkhand High Court on Friday quashed the appointment of Jharkhand minister for science and technology Samaresh Singh as the Regional Institute of Technology (RIT), Jamshedpur, chairman. The court asked the Union government to take over the management of the institute till further orders. The division bench comprising Chief Justice VK Gupta and Justice Tapan Sen, while hearing three petitions, passed orders regarding the appointment of Samaresh as RIT chairman. The court vacated its interim order, passed on December 21, 2001, whereby he was allowed to continue as chairman. Earlier, Samaresh had moved the HC against the decision of the single bench of Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya, who had quashed Samareshâ€™s appointment as the RIT chairman. The HC also set aside the appointment of JP Singh as RIT principal. He was appointed by Samresh. The Court observed that JP Singhâ€™s appointment as principal was against the law and was unfair. The court also issued notices to seven other teachers who were also appointed during the tenure of Samaresh as chairman. It directed that the senior-most teacher of RIT will function as acting principal till regular appointment is made by the board of governors. It also directed the Union government to take over the management of the RIT and manage its affairs till further orders. The termination order of ex-registrar S A Hussain was also stayed by the court.

13,Oppn MLA to sue housing minister,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress MLA and lawyer Arunabha Ghosh has accused West Bengal housing minister Gautam Deb of gross misuse of power.

According to Ghosh, the minister is refusing to distribute 182 government flats using his discretionary power.

Ghosh has decided to file a petition before the Calcutta High Court on Monday.

The total value of these flats, spread in different government housing complexes such as Dankuni and Barasat, was Rs 10 crore, Ghosh alleged.

â€œThe minister, as chairman of housing board, has kept these flats under his discretionary quota and is refusing to distribute these.This is gross misuse of power. It is also leading to huge losses to the government,â€� Ghosh told TNN.

Deb, however, is not perturbed by the allegation. â€œI am not aware of the matter. If Ghosh takes legal action, we will reply in court,â€� he said.

According to Ghosh, there is no provision of discretionary quota in the housing board statute. Moreover, the Calcutta High Court had banned the discretionary quota following a controversy over such allotments in the Tarak Singh vs Jyoti Basu case in 1998.

Even after that, Ghosh pointed out, flats had been allotted under the dis-cretionary quota.

â€œOn March 12, 2001, before the Assembly elections, Deb had distributed 62 apartments in a single day.â€�

15,Thakurs in UP want ministerial berths,"LUCKNOW: The rebellion in the Uttar Pradesh BJP took a casteist turn on Friday when Thakur MLAs demanded berths in the Mayawati ministry in proportion to their strength in the party.

A few Thakur MLAs, who met on Thursday, decided to bring up the issue during the BJP Legislature Party meeting scheduled for May 13. The crucial meeting has been convened at the residence of legislature party leader Rajnath Singh to quell the voice of dissension within the party over the proposed ministerial expansion.

â€˜â€˜Soon after taking oath of office, chief minister Mayawati had stated that caste-strength would be the basis for the representation of her party MLAs in the ministry. I hope our leaders would also pay heed to her formula and give representation to us accordingly,â€™â€™ said Rajendra Pratap Singh alias Moti Singh, BJP MLA from Pratapgarh.

Moti Singhâ€™s contention was that if caste was being given due consideration in the ministry formation, then Thakur MLAs, who number 31 in the BJP, should be given representation in proportion to their strength in the party.

Of the 88 BJP MLAs, there are 31 Thakur MLAs, 16 Dalits, 11 Brahmins, seven Kurmis, six Banias, four Khatris, two Yadavs, two Gujjars and two Kayasthas and four other legislators.

Chandramani Kant Singh, MLA from Bhinga in Bahraich district, who was the first to raise the banner of revolt over government formation, also holds the same view.

â€˜â€˜I would suggest that the party leadership should chose the top five or 10 on the basis of the strength of the caste. A ministerial berth should be given to the seniormost on the basis of his/her clean image,â€™â€™ he said.

16,India claims progress in child development,"NEW DELHI: Claiming â€˜â€˜impressive stridesâ€™â€™ towards achieving full development of its 380 million children â€” the worldâ€™s largest under 18 population â€” India has admitted to having â€˜â€˜miles to goâ€™â€™ before it can view its achievements with a sense of pride.

Addressing the UN General Assemblyâ€™s Special Session on Children on Thursday, HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi submitted Indiaâ€™s report on children stating, â€˜â€˜We feel satisfied without being complacent that we have made consistent progress towards some goals such as literacy, especially female literacy, access to safe drinking water, eradication of polio and food sufficiency.â€™â€™

He said India was â€˜â€˜determinedâ€™â€™ to build upon this momentum until it met all its goals for children. While ensuring childrenâ€™s rights, he said, India considered it important to emphasise â€˜â€˜proper valuesâ€™â€™ in children and develop â€˜â€˜sound characterâ€™â€™.

â€˜â€˜Only then can the true realisation of childrenâ€™s rights take place and they can be fully equipped to grow up to be healthy, happy and prosperous adults and enrich the society.â€™â€™

Joshi stressed on the need for providing â€˜â€˜strong support systemsâ€™â€™ to children, particularly girls, imparting them â€˜â€˜a sense of duty and respect towards their families, society, nation and humanity at large.â€™â€™

Traditionally and in contemporary India, there was a strong belief in the right to a family being â€˜â€˜the most primeval and fundamental of all childrenâ€™s rights, and the family the most vital unit,â€™â€™ Joshi said.

He conceded that Indiaâ€™s achievements vis a vis all indicators for children for the past decade have been â€˜â€˜positive, if not totalâ€™â€™ and that â€˜â€˜we realise that we still have a long road ahead, we are undeterred by the challenge.â€™â€™

Joshi spoke of the legislations, among them the constitutional amendment to include the right to free and compulsory education for all children.

The National Commission for Children, which is on the anvil, â€˜â€˜will be a statutory body to protect and monitor childrenâ€™s rights and review implementation of laws and programmes meant for children.â€™â€™

17,EC can’t derecognise party for bandhs: EC,"NEW DELHI: A political party indulging in some of the recognised unconstitutional acts such as enforcing â€˜bandhâ€™ and coercing people to observe strike cannot be derecognised by the Election Commission (EC).

The Supreme Court on Friday held that a political party can only be derecognised by the EC if it had got itself accredited â€˜â€˜by playing fraud on the commissionâ€™â€™.

A Bench comprising Justice V N Khare and Justice Ashok Bhan held that the EC could also derecognise a political party if it was declared â€˜â€˜unlawfulâ€™â€™ by the Central government.

Third, when it loses faith in the Constitution or the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy. Or a party declares that it would â€˜â€˜not uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of Indiaâ€™â€™.

The judgment is a fallout of appeals filed by the Congress, CPI and CPM. The petitioners had challenged a controversial Kerala High Court judgment in 2000 which declared a forcible â€˜hartalâ€™ by any political party an â€˜â€˜unconstitutional actâ€™â€™.

It had asked the EC to derecognise such political parties after an inquiry. It had also asked the EC to consider the applications for derecognition of certain political parties which had given a call for â€˜hartalâ€™ or â€˜bandhâ€™ in the state.

Attorney general Soli Sorabjee, Congressâ€™ counsel Ashwani Kumar, EC counsel S Murlidhar, CPM counsel Rajeev Dhawan and CPI counsel B K Pal argued before the apex court that the Representation of People Act did not give the EC the power to derecognise a political party for violating Constitutional provisions.

However, the Institute of Social Welfareâ€™s (ISW) counsel L Nageshwar Rao supported the high court judgment saying the EC was armed with powers to take action against a political party for violating the Constitution.

The ISW had moved the high court for enforcement of the apex courtâ€™s earlier ruling and sought derecognition of the political parties which were forcibly enforcing â€˜bandhsâ€™ or â€˜hartalsâ€™ in the state.

It said enforcing a â€˜hartalâ€™ or â€˜bandhâ€™ by force had been declared as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

Partially setting aside the high court judgment which related to a direction to the EC, the apex court said the Parliament had deliberately not given the EC the power to deregister a political party for non-compliance with the conditions for recognition.

â€˜â€˜This may be for the reason that the EC is required to function independently and ensure free and fair elections,â€™â€™ the Bench said.

18,Modi skips relief camps to placate ministers,"GANDHINAGAR/NEW DELHI: Chief minister Narendra Modi cancelled a crucial meeting with managers of ten Muslim relief camps on Friday. This was to be his first-ever formal meeting with them, barring the visit to the Shah-e-Alam refuge camp with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on April 4.

Modi, instead, spent the day appeasing his cabinet colleagues, who are disillusioned with his handling of the communal riots. For over two hours, he was closeted with water resources minister Narottam Patel and finance minister Nitin Patel.

In the last two cabinet meetings, Modi had drawn flak from his ministerial colleagues. Fridayâ€™s meetings were an attempt to quell the discontent within the ranks, especially in view of industry minister Suresh Mehtaâ€™s visit to New Delhi.

Mehta, who had been a vocal critic of the chief minister in Wednesdayâ€™s cabinet meeting, has apparently met the party bosses and home minister L K Advani. Though BJP president Jana Krishnamurthyâ€™s office refused to confirm any meeting with Mehta, officials from the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office said Vajpayee had not met him.

Nitin Patel told Times News Network that he had discussed â€˜â€˜departmental issuesâ€™â€™ with the chief minister, though he refused to reveal which ones.

After his meeting with Modi, Narottam, at a hurriedly called news conference, sought to deny that he was one of the discontented ministers.

Clarifying why he did not attend the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, he said: â€˜â€˜It was not a boycott. I was away for a religious function in Gangeth village in Mehsana district. I had postponed it thrice. I did not want to postpone it again.â€™â€™

A senior official in Modiâ€™s office, however, sought to explain that the meeting with relief camp managers had to be cancelled â€˜â€˜because of the sudden deterioration in the law and order as the chief minister had to review the situationâ€™â€™.

19,CM’s eye makes minister work,"HYDERABAD: The decision of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu to assess the performance of ministers through microscopic eye has resulted in pulling them out of their slumber.

Major industries minister K Vidyadhar Rao, who normally does not meet the media, was the first one to convene a press conference and gave out details about the manner in which the government had attracted investment. He compared industrial growth of the state with other states.

This was followed by a press conference on Friday by information technology minister who wanted to reel out details about the convergence in the government departments and also presented a brief report on his visit to Singapore, China and Malaysia. The odd thing about this press conference was the presence of information and public relations minister at the press conference.

Justifying his presence, information minister S Chandramohan Reddy said that he had joined the press conference for better coordination. â€œThe purpose of the Fridayâ€™s press conference was to give details about the progress in various departments which have been brought under one umbrella called employment generation. I felt coordination from the department of information was necessary,â€� he explained.

Talking to The Times Of India, both he and IT minister B Gopalakrishna Reddy felt that the state should make radical changes in the rules and regulations, if the state were to attract industry.

Though the government was taking several steps to simplify the procedure by setting up single window system, the rules like frequent inspections by officers of various departments and other mandatory clearances under various sections of the law was hindering the process of speedy industrialisation.

Gopalakrishna Reddy had apprised the chief minister about the problems that have been brought to his notice during his recent foreign visit.

According to minister for employment generation B Gopalakrishna Reddy, the modified programme will enable self-help groups (SHGs) to implement projects in a more practical manner.

Along with empowerment of women, the government also hopes to address the social evils in rural areas with the help of SHGs through the Velugu programme. The minister said that if a SHGs felt that their village required a school or a water pipeline, or a road, they would be permitted to take up such projects as well.

23,NC rules out J&K polls under President's rule,"JAMMU: National Conference leader and Union Minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday ruled out holding of ensuing Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir under President''s Rule, saying there was no precedence of elected governments stepping down to facilitate such a dispensation.

""The question of the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister resigning to facilitate elections under Central rule does not arise,"" Minister of State for External Affairs Abdullah said in reply to a question by newsmen here.

He said that National Conference had been voted to power with two-thirds of majority in the previous elections under President''s rule.

He allayed apprehensions of so called rigging of elections and said that the National Conference government had assured free and fair polls.

The Election Commission (EC) was also committed to free and fair polls, he said, adding ""where there are so many assurances and media being the watch dog, there is no room for such fears.""

The forthcoming polls were being held under the direct supervision of the EC, which has established a fair degree of credibility, both within and outside the country, he said and suggested use of electronic voting machines for preventing chances of bogus voting.

To a question, Abdullah said that his party, like in the previous election campaign, would project issues like development, autonomy and human rights.

The National Conference manifesto for the coming polls would be made public soon, said Abdullah.

On the sharp divisions in Hizbul Mujahideen and action against top commander Majid Dar, Abdullah said that Majid Dar had begun realising the ground realities in Kashmir since last year.

He said that separatists had no support base among the masses, which some of them too had realised. About Majid Dar''s joining in the election fray, Abdullah declined to make any comments but hoped that he would do so.

He apprehended upsurge in violence in different parts of the state in the light of a Pakistani minister''s plan to sabotage the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir.

Asked whether there was a change in Islamabad''s attitude towards India, Omar said that on the contrary, hostility towards New Delhi had increased. The Western world also acknowledged the spurt of terrorism unleashed from across the border in Jammu and Kashmir. In fact, infiltration had increased, he said.

He charged Pakistan for blaming India for the recent bomb blasts in Karachi or the incidents of the like that took place either in Jammu and Kashmir or in Pakistan.

""Anything that is happening in Pakistan is attributed to the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW),"" he said.

About the National Conference abstaining from Parliament on the issue voting on Gujarat, he asked if the 28-member strong TDP could not seek pulling down of the Narendra Modi government, how could his party achieve it?

On the Gujarat issue, the NC had a definite stand on the issue which it demonstrated and got registered by remaining absent from the voting in Parliament.
