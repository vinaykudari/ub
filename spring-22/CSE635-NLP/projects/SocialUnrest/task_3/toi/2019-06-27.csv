3,4 onion farmers commit suicide,"PATNA: Four farmers have reportedly committed suicide in the Jalla area here due to the failure of the onion crop.

The onion crop in the Jalla area failed due to unseasonal rain. The heavy rain in the region also damaged the harvested onion crop that was lying unsold at several places in the area, including the Patna Saheb railway station.

Though the police have yet to confirm the suicide reports, the local residents maintain that the failure of the onion crop due to the unseasonal rain has had an adverse impact on the farmers of the area as most of them have no other source of income.

Even as the state government is yet to come out with a statement on the issue, several Left parties have reacted sharply to the reports of the farmers committing suicide.

The state council of the CPI alleged that farmers were committing suicide because they were unable to pay off the money taken from government banks or private moneylenders. The situation, it said, was similar to the one experienced by farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra earlier which had compelled some farmers there to commit suicide. The CPI asked the government to announce immediate relief to the farmers in the Jalla area, including the waiving of loans. The state CPM has also made a similar demand.

Senior JD (U) leader Mundrika Prasad Yadav expressed his concern over the suicide reports and demanded payment of Rs 5 lakh as compensation to each of the bereaved families.

4,"Police fire on evictees, bandh called","KOLKATA: Police opened fire on a mob on Wednesday, killing a tea labourer and injuring four others on the outskirts of Siliguri. A 12-hour Siliguri Bandh has been called on Thursday in protest.

The workers were resisting attempts to evict them from the Chandmoni Tea Estate on Wednesday. The eviction move was to facilitate construction of a housing project on the tea estate land.

Ramprasad Bhakat was killed and four others â€” including a woman worker and a 14-year-old boy â€” were injured in the firing. A few policemen including DSP (town) C.S. Lepcha were also hurt.

While the promoters and the state government were permitted to build the township by the Calcutta High Court, workers pointed out that this was conditional and the state had to ensure their proper re-habilitation first.

The Chandmoni Tea Estate Anti-Eviction Joint Action Committee set up to oppose the eviction alleged that the government allowed the lease of 406 acres of land worth Rs 100 crore against a paltry payment of Rs 13.92 crore.

The committee defended the agitation saying that the authorities had nei-ther prepared an environmental impact assessment report nor confirmed job security or rehabilitation for the workers.

Following the confrontation around 9 am, irate workers blocked NH 31 for more than five hours, which was broken by the Combat Force and police led by the SP.

JAC convenor Abhijit Mazumdar, son of the late Naxalite leader Charu Mazumdar, was arrested on the previous night along with four others.

Thirty-two persons were arrested afresh during the day and raids were continuing, said Vivek Sarkar of the APDR, a JAC constituent.

Singh said that the supporting parties had not yet imbibed the spirit of the coalition partners. But the Union minister, who is also president of the RLD, said that both the BSP and the BJP were keen to carry on their experiment to its full tenure, though their previous experience in the partnership was â€œunpleasantâ€�.

Singh said that irrespective of the past experiences, no body wanted poll and this would enable them to stay together.

13,Coffee planters resent revised taxation policy,"CHIKMAGALUR: The coffee growers of Chikmagalur district on Thursday accused the Union government of sounding the death knell for coffee growers through the introduction of a revised rule on taxation.

Speaking to reporters here, Karnataka Growers'' Federation President Attikatte Jagannath said the Union government, by introducing Rule 7-B, Subsections 1 and 2, has brought the coffee growers selling ``hulled'''' and ``ground'''' coffee under the central income tax net.

``All these days, the Union government had turned a deaf ear to the hardship faced by the coffee growers. Now, it has closed its eyes too.''''

The revised rules stipulate that coffee growers, who sell coffee after hulling and grinding, will have to offer 25 per cent of their income as central income tax and those who sell coffee after roasting and grinding will have to pay 40 per cent of their income as central income tax.

Attikatte Jagannath described the notification as ``retrogressive'''', which will restrain small and medium coffee growers from selling their coffee on their own brand names.

He said in the changed circumstances small and marginal growers will have to sell their produce through traders. ``This will further endanger the farmers who are already at the mercy of traders.''''

He regretted that instead of relieving planters of the financial crunch they are facing, the Union government has burdened them with ``many formalities to observe''''.

Attikatte Jagannath said the planting community, which is not in a position to meet the production cost due to a severe slump in the prices of coffee which have hit an all-time low, is wilting under the new policy formulated by the Union government. ``Instead of lending a helping hand, the government is slapping the farmers with unnecessary tax,'''' he said.

â€¢ Sridhar, a domestic worker at an estate in Sakleshpur, had his hand tied and wrapped up in cloth, doused with kerosene and burnt by his employer, because Sridhar stole jamoons.

â€¢ 13-year-old Khair-un-Nissa was kidnapped from Hosur and tortured by her employer in Bangalore.

â€¢ 11-year-old Shasikala''s employees were managers of Karnataka State Financial Corporation (KSFC). Sashikala was beaten and bitten if she did not cook on time. She had bite marks all over her body when rescued.

15,"Krishna inducts 9, drops 5 ministers","BANGALORE: In an overhaul of his 31-month-old ministry, Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Thursday inducted nine new faces, dropped five ministers and elevated one to Cabinet rank. Consequently, the Cabinet strength has gone up from 44 to 48, including the chief minister.

The shuffle had been hanging fire for a long time, and having got it done with, a relaxed Krishna told reporters: ``There is nothing like total satisfaction. It is a graded satisfaction.''''

The nine new additions are former KPCC President V.S. Koujalgi, H.M. Revanna and Ramalinga Reddy (all Cabinet rank), while G. Parameshwara has been promoted. The Ministers of State are Basavaraj H. Patil, Vasant V. Salian, M.L. Ustad, K.N. Gaddi. G. Raju Gowda and K.B. Koliwad.

Those dropped are B.B. Chimmanakatti, A.M. Hindasgeri, T.B. Jayachandra, S.R. Kashappanavar (all Cabinet rank) and Veerakumar A. Patil (minister of state).

Contrary to expectation that Krishna might go in for major surgery by slashing the ``over-representation'''' to districts like Gulbarga or the Legislative Council, the exercise smacked of political exigency. Nevertheless, the ministry now has representation from all districts and castes.

Krishna said: ``We will use the dropped ministers for party work. The restructuring is in no way a reflection on their competence.''''

Going a step ahead to justify the revamp, the CM said: ``The rationale was to give representation to all and induct young blood. But we cannot wish the old people away.''''

On the possibilities of a further revamp, Krishna said this is a ``continuous exercise, which will be done as and when the situation demands''''. However, he stated that for the present, the exercise had ended.

Krishna said ``wait, watch and see,'''' when asked whether the new ministry would benefit Karnataka in any way. ``The additional burden on the exchequer is something which happens. But we will give better and more purposeful governance,'''' he stated.

16,Robbers wanted in 45 crimes arrested,"NEW DELHI: The police have arrested five persons who they allege were part of a desperate gang of robbers and auto-lifters responsible for at least 45 heinous crimes.

Officials said the gang had struck on several occasions in various parts of the city including Najafgarh, Dwarka, Shalimar Bagh, Rohini, Saket and Defence Colony. The five accused have been identified as Hemant alias Sonu (24), Muninder Sharma (28), Vijay (26), Rahul Mittal (22) and Sandip (22). Hemant was be arrested on May 29.

That day itself, according to the police, Ravinder Singh Rawat lodged a complaint in Malviya Nagar stating that he had been attacked by an armed assailant. He told the police that he had gone to PVR Saket to watch a movie but could not get any tickets.

So he got some food packed and drove to Hauz Rani in his Hyundai Accent and after parking his car by the roadside started eating his dinner. At about 10.45 pm an Opel Astra stopped near his car and a man jumped out. The man, armed with a pistol, dragged Rawat out of his car and asked him to hand over his mobile phone.

When Rawat refused, the assailant fired a shot into the ground. He then got into Rawatâ€™s car and tried to drive away. When Rawat tried to stop him, the assailant fired another shot but accidentally hit himself in the right leg. The injured assailants ran away and his accomplices in the Opel also drove off.

On hearing Rawatâ€™s complaint, the police sent out search parties and flashed messages over the wireless network. Constable Surender Singh Attari, who was on patrolling duty, soon spotted a man walking with a limp. When Attari asked the man to stop, he tried to run away. The constable, however, nabbed him. The accused was identified as Hemant.

Hemant was questioned at length and reportedly confessed to having committed several heinous crimes, including murders, robberies and kidnappings for ransom, in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh along with his gang members. Over the next one month the police also managed to arrest the remaining members of Hemantâ€™s gang.

Officials said while Hemant, Vijay and Sandeep were school dropouts, Muninder was a postgraduate. The son of a retired UP police inspector, he is also a state level cricketer. Police officials said that the accused used to steal cars to commit robberies and would then either sell the car to other criminals or abandon them. Already, a number of such luxury cars have been found abandoned in Haryana and UP.

The police have also recovered two stolen cars and a Chinese pistol from the accused. The Delhi Police have also informed the police in Palwal to attach a flat in Jagatpuri owned by Vijay. They said that the flat was to be sealed as Vijay is believed to have bought it from the money he earned from his criminal activities.
