1,Rising fees bite into Symbiosis law students' pockets,"PUNE: A large number of students at the Symbiosis law college are agitated over the galloping fees, which they feel are not value for money. The fee level started heading upward after Symbiosis attained its ""deemed university"" status in 2002.

""We weren''t told at the time of admission that fees would be increased every year. Besides, we are not getting the benefits promised to us,"" aggrieved students, requesting anonymity, told TNN.

Asked about to comment, Symbiosis Society president and principal director S.B. Muzumdar told TNN that the fees were in tune with those of other national law colleges in the country.

""We don''t receive any grants from the government or any other funding agency,"" he said, explaining that the fee is inclusive of all facilities made available to the students. Annual fees for the fiveyear bachelor of law degree (BA-LLB) for the first batch of students, before the â€˜deemed university'' status, rose from Rs 8,000 (in 2002-03) to Rs 16,000 (2003-04) and now to Rs 19,000 (proposed for 2004-05).

For the second batch of students under the â€˜deemed university'' status, who opted for the new bachelor of business administration (BBALLB) course, the annual fees increased from Rs 36,500 (in 2003-04) to Rs 41,500 for new admissions in 2004. For the five-year B.A.-LLB course, annual fees increased from Rs 31,500 (in 2003) to Rs 40,000 (in 2004).

The annual fees include charges towards students activity fee (Rs 2,000), library (Rs 4,000), Internet and computer fee (Rs 4,000) and contingency fund (Rs 1,000).

Although a journal fund (Rs 1,000) was collected towards in-house journals, many students said they did not receive copies of it. If a student wished to avail facilities of the placement cell, he/she is required to pay an additional Rs 5,000.

Muzumdar said that the reason for hiking the fees after securing â€˜deemed university'' status was ""primarily to provide the best facilities to students. Last year itself, we got about 15 high court and an equal number of supreme court judges to lecture the law students."" He said that the fee structure was approved by the Symbiosis deemed university''s board of management before being implemented.

About the Rs 5,000 towards placement cell charges, Muzumdar said the money was utilised to groom students for interviews and group discussions. ""Students who find their own placements, but require recommendation letters, are asked to pay Rs 200 each,"" he said. Students complained that although they paid Rs 4,000 each year towards library fees, the research material available was not of exceptional quality. Besides, the library doesn''t even have a Xerox facility, one student said.

The deemed university''s registrar, Vivek Phadke, admitted that ""a few complaints"" had been received that some of the faculty were not even fully conversant with English. ""We have now started an orientation programme where both the teaching as well as nonteaching members are imparted training on certain aspects, such as speaking good English and how to conduct classes.""

On the complaint that the students were not receiving journals, Phadke said the law college publishes about six in-house journals every year. ""It is possible that a few students may have been left out and not got the journals,"" he said.

2,"3 call girls, 5 pimps arrested in Vasant Kunj","NEW DELHI: The southwest district police arrested three call girls and five pimps from a farmhouse in Vasant Kunj on Monday evening. According to the police, these girls were charging more than Rs 10,000 from customers and were active all over Delhi.

The police also seized three vehiclesâ€” two Cielo and a Toyotaâ€” from the accused. ""They were using a beacon light for one of the vehicles. They had also placed an Intelligence Bureau plate on another car to dodge the police,"" said DCP (southwest) Tajendra Luthra.

The police also claimed to have seized Rs 1.16 lakh and three wireless sets from the accused. ""They were using only wireless sets and not mobile phones to prevent the police from tracking their movement,"" said an officer.

The police claimed they had received a tip-off about a week ago that call girls were operating from this farmhouse. A decoy customer was used to strike a deal with the pimps who agreed to provide a girl for Rs 10,000.

The police then raided the farmhouse at about 5.30 pm and arrested the accused. A case under the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act has been registered in Vasant Kunj police station.

The police also seized a number of photographs of the girls from the farmhouse. ""The pimps used these photographs to show to prospective customers. We will take action against all these girls once their identity is established,"" said the officer.

The police stated that strict action would also be taken against the owner of the farmhouse for facilitating prostitution. However, his identity is yet to be established.

The three girls who have been held are said to be between 20-25 years of age. While one of the girls belongs to Bangalore, the two others are said to be from Baramullah in Kashmir.

3,Parties LoCk in on patriotic movies,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA/SURAT: If the real-life Kargil War inspired voters in the 1999 elections, patriotic fervour is being whipped up in sitting-rooms across the state even now. Cable operators are feeding viewers a diet of patriotic films just before Gujarat goes to the hustings. So, if there has been a bombardment of nationalism on the local channel, blame it on Elections 2004.

Multi-service operators (MSOs) and cable operators admit that they were under pressure from political parties to show ""patriotic films"" on local channels. ""Many operators have been forced to show such movies for the past fortnight.

As they are played by MSOs from control rooms, operators are hardly left with a choice. Even satellite channels have been telecasting movies such as ''Legend of Bhagat Singhâ€™ and ''Gadarâ€™ to whip up jingoistic fervour before the polls,"" says Ahmedabad Cable Operators Association president Pramod Pandya.

""MSOs often try to please the ruling party. Itâ€™s time for the operators to return favours as they take help from politicians to ward off competition in their areas of operation. Clearly, politicians are looking to influence the votersâ€™ mindset,"" says Pandya.He says such films are being shown in areas like Paldi, Sarkhej, Bavla, Juhapura, Vasna, Vejalpur, Jivraj Park, Vastrapur, Behrampura, Shahpur, Daripur, Shahibaug, Sabarmati, Vadaj, Kalol and Bapunagar in Ahmedabad.

In Vadodara, too, cable operators admit to being forced to show patriotic films. ""I was approached by both the Congress and the BJP to show such films. The Congress asked me to show ''Gandhiâ€™ while ''Borderâ€™ and ''LoCâ€™ were the BJPâ€™s choice,"" says a cable operator in Vadodara, Chandraprakash Rawal, who operates in the Karelibaug area.

Areas like Makarpura showed ''Borderâ€™ and ''Bhagat Singhâ€™ till Monday night.

If ''Gandhi,â€™ ''LoC,â€™ ''Borderâ€™ and ''Gadarâ€™ are the flavour in Ahmedabad, it is ''Sarfaroshâ€™ that is being fed into numerous sitting-rooms in Surat since the last three days.

In areas like Adajan, City Light, Ghod Dod Road, Parle Point, Athwa Lines and several others places in the city, cable operators have been showing the Aamir Khan starrer.

Ahmedabad-based MSO Parag Patel, owner of Ekta Cable Net, says:""We do get pressurised to telecast a certain genre of films, which would help the prospects of a certain party.We try to ward off such requests.

However, channels such as Star Gold and Sony Max have been repeatedly showing films like ''Gadarâ€™, ''Legend of Bhagat Singh,â€™ and ''Sarfarosh.â€™ We have no control over them.""

Operators recall how, during the December 2002 assembly election, they were virtually ''forcedâ€™ to show Chief Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s promotional videos after the alleged ''fatwaâ€™ issued by Muslim clerics. ""We had to either show them or face the music,"" said an operator.

4,Mazdas drive the politics of protest here,"KANPUR: Swaraj Mazdas used by politicians - like the one Deputy PM L K Advani used for his Bharat Uday Yatra - are usually unrecognisable, with new bodies, air-conditioning and election slogans painted on the exterior.

But the one that wends its way through Kanpur''s streets these days is unmistakably an unfurbished Swaraj Mazda, a mini-truck carrying under an unrelenting sun CPM candidate and former MP Subhashini Ali and her supporters, followed by a few cars, jeeps, but mainly scooters, mopeds with workers flying the red hammer and sickle.

Ali may not be in the race for Kanpur which is a straight contest between sitting Congress MP Sriprakash Jaiswal and the Samajwadi Party''s Haji Mushtaq Solanki, with the BJP''s Satyadeo Pachauri in third place.

But Ali''s campaign is testimony to the fact that the politics of protest is not dead in this city of closed mills, garbage heaps, potholed roads and traffic jams.

Ali''s convoy stops at Bakerganj Chauraha, one of the poorer parts on Kanpur''s outskirts.

""My life is an open book, no scams, no corruption. I don''t have a son who is a thekedar, no one in my family is a thekedar. Vajpayee promised to open the closed mills. But what has he done? He has made cellphones cheaper and kerosene and sugar expensive. Those who have looted you for the last five years have now arrived to loot your votes. UP has had governments of many hues, but you don''t have electricity or handpumps, the roads have vanished. Do you want your sons to be reduced to selling smack and running daru ke thekes? Vote for your sister who will raise your problems in Parliament.""

5,Election Commission's database on poll violence,"KOLKATA: West Bengal is well and truly under the Election Commission''s scanner. The chief electoral officer is preparing a computerised database on pre-poll election violence in the state, on the basis of complaints filed by parties and candidates and feedbacks from the administration.

Depending on this, the Election Commission will decide which booths to declare sensitive. As many as 1,200 booths have already been declared ""hypersensitive"".

""Under the EC''s guidelines, the number of sensitive booths has to be estimated one week ahead of the polling because the situation keeps changing,"" CEO Basudeb Banerjee said on Monday.

During the day, all 126 election observers for the state were debriefed by the CEO and IG (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee on the situation prevailing in the state.

""Many of them are new to the state and have to be told about the basic facts, the number of constituencies, the geography of the state and the possible trouble spots,"" Banerjee said. The observers were particularly briefed on the recent Maoist attack at Pashupati in Darjeeling district.

All election observers will reach their allotted destinations by Tuesday morning after which they will hold meetings with the district authorities and assess their requirement.

Their telephone numbers and addresses (where they put up) will be publicly displayed so that parties and candidates can contact them whenever necessary.

The CEO is also making arrangements for extra telephones in the offices of district magistrates and police superintendents. Opposition parties have complained that they often failed to contact the district authorities during emergencies because of the lack of telephones.

In south Bengal, the PW-dominated areas of Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura have been identified as potential trouble spots, while in north Bengal, it''s areas affected by Kamtapur Liberation Organisation.

A total of 17 police stations have been identified as sensitive, 10 of them in the three south Bengal districts, four in Jalpaiguri and three in Cooch Behar.

Describing the law and order situation as ""under control"", the CEO said complaints of violence were ""not unusually large"" this year.

He said the complaint from Trinamul Congress candidate Krishna Basu that she had been prevented from campaigning at Mograhat would be looked into.

6,"A little bit of masti, this election day","HYDERABAD: Polling day is not just about exercising your franchise.While you must make sure you cast your vote, it''s also a day to kick back and have fun, as it is after all a holiday.

If you can cast your vote early enough, you will have a free day at your disposal. Music concerts, exhibitions and religious discourses are a few of the events being held across the city on Tuesday.

And if you prefer to stay at home to beat the heat, check the television listings for your favourite movies and programmes. If you find the poll heat seducing, you can also catch the electionrelated programmes on most news channels.

However, if you are an outdoor person, here are some of the places and events you can go for:

Snow World, the snow park which opened in the city recently, is an ideal place to beat the heat. The park recently introduced artificial snowfall too, which will make you feel you are in the Alps, even if for as short a period of ten minutes. You do get to spend an hour inside the snow dome, though.

If you are a book lover, head for the YMCA building in Secunderabad, where a book exhibition by English publishers and distributors will be on from 11.30 am.

Several spiritual discourses are being held in the city too. â€˜Hanumatha Parayanam'', a devotional music programme will he held at Sri Venkateshwara Swamy Temple in Chikkadpally from 6 pm.

Cinema theatres and parks across the city will stay open. So will all the restaurants. However, there''s no good news for night owls as bars and pubs will stay closed.With prohibition being enforced, tipplers are in for a tough time.
