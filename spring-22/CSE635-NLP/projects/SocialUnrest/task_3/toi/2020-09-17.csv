0,"Before Navratri, govt sings divestment tune","GANDHINAGAR/AHMEDABAD: In an obvious bid to generate a ""feel good factor"" on the eve of the Vibrant Gujarat show, the Gujarat government on Wednesday announced its intention to kick-start â€” what it called â€” an ambitious programme of restructuring/ privatising state public sector companies.

The announcement, which came after the weekly Cabinet meeting, however, did not set any time-frame for the divestment process. Neither did it identify the companies.

However, it said that a Cabinet subcommittee, headed by the CM, was being constituted for the purpose and also an ""independent experts'' committee"" was being set up to decide the details.

Gujarat has 55 state-owned companies and analysts said that when divestment does take place, Gujarat State Fertilisers and Chemicals, Gujarat Narmada Valley Corporation, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation and Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals could be prime candidates for privatisation. Given the past experience in other states and also the Centre, analysts however felt that it would be at least a year or more before anything concrete happens.

Interestingly, the programme announced on Wednesday is also with a view to strengthen the strained finances of the state government and its high debt.

A recent Reserve Bank of India bulletin says that the total debt of the Gujarat government as on March 2003-end was Rs 46,689 crore, up from Rs 38,102 crore in the previous year. Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are the only states whose debts are higher.

An official statement from the state government said: ""The state finance department would set up a separate fund for debt repayment. The fund would include money made available to the state government after disinvestment and restructuring of the PSUs.""

The disinvestment process â€” which had been mooted earlier â€” came to a standstill in 1999 when Keshubhai Patel was in power. Though a Cabinet subcommittee under the chairmanship of state finance minister Vajubhai Vala for disinvestment was formed soon after Narendra Modi returned to power in December 2002, it has not met yet.

To give more credibility to Wednesday''s announcement, the official press note said that Modi had discussed the matter with Union minister for disinvestment Arun Shourie recently and the latter had ""a word of praise"" for the state government''s ""module.""

Vajubhai Vala told TNN that the process of setting up the two disinvestment groups for giving expert and technical advise would be formed after the Navratri. ""We have no time for that now,"" he emphasised.

Significantly, the official note says that any PSU disinvestment would be ""approved"" by the Gujarat Assembly which would now meet for its budget session in February 2004. ""Full transparency would be ensured in the matter,"" the note said.

1,HC questions minister's continuance in cabinet,"HYDERABAD: Stopping short of asking housing minister P Ramasubba Reddy to quit, a division bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on Wednesday wondered how he has been continuing in the council of ministers despite facing a double murder charge.

The bench, comprising justices Bilal Nazki and K C Bhanu was dealing with a contempt case against former Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president M Satyanarayana Rao. It accepted Raoâ€™s apology, but found fault with the continuance of the minister in the cabinet.

â€œThere is no provision in the Representation of the People Act or in the Constitution of India which disables him (Ramasubba Reddy) from being a minister, but at the same time such instances raise the question with regard to the working of democracy and democratic institutions,â€� Justice Nazki said in the order.

The contempt case was filed against comments made by the former PCC chief regarding the transfer of a criminal case against Ramasubba Reddy from Mahbubnagar to Hyderabad. When the High Court transferred the trial of a murder case in which the minister is the principal accused, Rao had alleged that it was done for the ministerâ€™s convenience.

This comment was brought to the notice of the High Court by Jandhyala Ravishanker, an advocate, and the court issued a contempt notice to Rao.

Ramasubba Reddy, who represents Jammalamadugu constituency in the Assembly, was accused in the Shadnagar double murder case in which his rival Narayana Reddyâ€™s uncles were killed.

2,Vehicle theft gang leader arrested,"PUNE: Acting on a tip-off, crime branch sleuths on Tuesday arrested Yogesh Shanbaug (26) of Kondhwa Budruk for his alleged involvement in an inter-state vehicle theft racket.

The police said many of Shanbaugâ€™s accomplices are currently in the custody of the Karnataka police.

The gang used to allegedly steal cars from various cities and send them to Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

The members of the gang used to hire a car, stop at hotels and offer liquor or sedatives to the driver before escaping with the vehicle.

Later, the suspects used to change the registration number and send the vehicle to another state, the police said.

A team of the Karnataka police was in the city looking for Shanbaug for eight days, but they failed to trace him.

3,Togadia case: HC gives govt 10 days to file affidavit,"PATNA: Taking a serious view of the Bihar government''s failure to file counter-affidavits within the set time frame in cases related to banishment of VHP leaders, Pravin Togadia and Acharya Giriraj Kishore, the Patna High Court on Wednesday directed the government to ensure filing of the affidavits within 10 days detailing reasons for its action against the two.

A division Bench of Justice S N Jha and Justice B N P Singh while expressing their displeasure over the state''s failure to file counter-affidavits by Wednesday, the date set by the court for the purpose, directed the Standing Counsel, R K Dutta, to file the affidavit before the Bench within 10 days.

""The court is giving the last opportunity to the government,"" the judges observed.

Two separate criminal writ petitions were filed in the last week of August by advocate Pramod Kumar Sinha on behalf of the VHP challenging the state''s decision to send the two leaders from the Patna airport immediately on their arrival.

The petitioners'' counsels, Tarakant Jha and Pramod Kumar Sinha, appearing before the Bench on September 2 on behalf of the two VHP leaders had argued that the state government''s action infringed on the fundamental rights of a citizen under Article 19 (right to freedom of speech and movement) and Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution and principle of natural justice.

Jha and Sinha had argued that Togadia was served the ban notice by the Patna District Magistrate, Deepak Prasad, even before he had disembarked from the plane and was not given sufficient time to plead his case.

4,"Needed, law for women's rights","LUCKNOW: Advocating a national law which could protect the women rights in every community, former chairman of Indian Association of Women Studies, Zarina Bhatti, on Wednesday said that fundamentalist elements in the Muslim community were responsible for the miserable condition of women in the community.

She also came down on media for giving more publicity to the radical elements in comparison to the progressive voices in the Muslim community.

Bhatti, who is executive member in the Indian Association of Women Studies and Centre for Women and Development Studies, was delivering a lecture on women and communalism at a refresher course on â€˜Women Studies'' organised by the Academic Staff College at Lucknow University. Bhatti is daughter of poet Majaz Lakhnavi and aunt of lyricist Javed Akhtar.

In her valedictory address, she spoke on women''s study in India and flayed University Grants commission (UGC) for its recent decision to disband the standing committee on women and decided to rename Women Studies Centres as Centre for Women and Family. She said that role of a woman was not just restricted to family only, but she also plays role in society and nation building.

Tracing the history of women liberation movement in India, she said that there was a lull in the post-independence era for some time, but after hectic lobbying by women groups, UGC introduced Women''s Studies Centre in universities.

â€œStrangely enough India has some very radical laws such as the abortion law which accepts the rights of a woman over her body and legally allows a married women to abort without the permission of her husband,â€� she said adding, â€œanother radical legislation has been to grant alimony to a female companion who may have been living with a man over a considerable period of time without being formally married.â€�

Bhatti, who was the first in the country to do a study on women bidi workers, said that modern economics define a person as â€˜working'' when he/she devotes eight hours daily on a single â€˜work activity''.

But the work of a woman, who while rolling bidis at home, took care of her children, cooked food among other things, was not recognised as â€˜work'', she added.

5,Campaigning for LUSU polls hots up,"LUCKNOW: Don''t be confused with a by-election for a prestigious seat. Welcome to Lucknow University Students Union elections, where campaign war for election reached the feverish pitch on Wednesday, three days before the filing of the nomination. Since simultaneous students union elections are being held in other degree colleges, the entire city is under siege.

Assessments and previous experiences say these student leaders are all set to spend between Rs 2-3 crore in the next 15 days. Prestige of political parties is at stake and future of over 200 student leaders has been put to gamble. There are over 50,000 student voters but, significantly, even after this pomp and show, most of the student leaders expect only 10-15 per cent polling in the elections.

So, whatever is available, they are putting in all their might. Innovative techniques are being adopted to woo voters, particularly girls. So, while sitting LUSU vice-president Abhishek Singh Ashu, a candidate for presidentship, included blind students of LU in his procession on Wednesday to attract other voters and to show that he had an image of â€˜socially responsible person'', Dhananjay Updhayaya, another presidential candidate, was seen along with scores of motorcyclists canvassing in their own unique way.

Some included girls to woo girl voters, others flashing mobiles and fancy spectacles, donning jeans, visited girls hostels, with their supporters standing outside distributing cards to girls and, at the same time, taking the opportunity to have a chat with them.

Shantanu Sharma, a LLB student and candidate for president, described situation on Sitapur Road campus as â€˜worse'' in comparison to the old campus. â€œThe campus has been converted into a garbage din with cards and pamphlets dumped everywhere, walls have been coloured with election messages,â€� he said and lodged a complaint with the vice-chancellor about violation of election code of conduct.

Investigations revealed that cost of one card is coming to be around Rs 10-20, a poster around Rs 30-50, a banner Rs 50-100, a hoarding Rs 500-1000, a car on hire between Rs 500-1000 per day. The list is endless. Significantly, the maximum a student leader can spent is only Rs 10,000 as per the election code of conduct.

7,Turning Red Fort into a farmhouse,"NEW DELHI: Weep, Shah Jehan.

After the Taj, it''s the Red Fort.

Conservationists and archaeologists are in an eye-ball to eye-ball confrontation with the Union tourism and culture ministry over the so-called renovation of Delhi''s most historic monument.

The heritage-wallahs allege that the ongoing work sanctioned by the ministry is drastically altering the fundamental structure of the ASI-protected Lal Qila.

Addressing the Minister, Mr Jagmohan, in a pained missive, Rajeev Sethi, design expert and founder trustee, Asian Heritage Foundation, says, ""This letter is penned to express the urgency of preparing or updating a more visible master plan before any more work is done on the so-called repairs or restorations. Indeed, such considerations could also mean a careful reversal of the ''jobs'' completed.""

The particularly disturbing renovations are indicated in the box alongside.

Shahid Amin, professor of history at DU, seethes, ""Ill-thought-out restoration has literally gouged out the Red Fort in the interest of creating a pedestrian and un-historical uniformity.Had the original inlays been retained, they would have provided a point of reference for the relationship between 17th century and 20th century Indian craftsmanship. We will wilfully destroy this dharohar unless the original inlays are put back.""

According to Sethi, ""On a short visit with several scholars to the Red Fort, I noticed alarming mistakes in the renovation work. This work can''t be done by run-of-the mill contractors without credentials and zealous officials eager to cut corners. There is a need for preparing or upgrading a more visible master plan before any further work is done.""

However, AK Sinha, ASI superintendent and the overseeing official, claims, ""No violation has occurred during the renovation of the Red Fort. As far as possible, we have tried to retain the original structure, while following the documentation, design and records available to us.""

Jagmohan is currently in Shimla and could not be contacted. Tourism and culture secretary Dhanendra Kumar, now in Manali, said ""Let me come back to Delhi, and I will speak on the subject.""

8,Upbeat Cong hits out at govt 'attitude',"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday adopted petroleum minister Ram Naik''s description of the Supreme Court''s judgment on privatisation of oil giants HPCL and BPCL as ""historic"" to mount an attack on the Vajpayee government.

Because of its ""know-it-all"" attitude on sensitive legal and constitutional matters, the government had invited a series of adverse remarks from the apex court in recent months, Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said. ""Some persons never learn the lessons of history and keep repeating their errors despite reminders from constitutional authorities,"" Singhvi said.

He recalled that when chief election commissioner Lyngdoh corrected the Gujarat government''s perceptions on election dates, ""he was subjected to the vilest of abuse. The SC judgement on the Gujarat elections laid to rest all the fancy constitutional theories trotted out by the BJP and its leading lights.""

Singhvi said the recent Best Bakery proceedings had ""again warned the BJP government"", where the Gujarat government was asked to ""quit"" if it could not prosecute those accused of heinous crimes.

In the HPCL and BPCL, Singhvi pointed out that Section 7 of the relevant law required that they remain government companies. The government did not pay heed to this provision. ""It is no use now making comments that in India everyone has a veto. In this case, the statute had a veto and the SC has reminded the government of it.""

16,New transfer policy for non-gazetted employees,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab police has formulated a transfer and posting policy for the field police personnel under which non-gazetted officials posted at a place for more than five years would be transferred out of their respective ranges.

A spokesman of the police department said it had come to notice that police officials posted in a particular district for a long period tended to develop vested interests and also miss out on the exposure to various nuances of policing in other areas.

In order to check this, it was required that a system of rotation was devised so that the police officials at the cutting edge level must not stay in a particular police district or a police range over and above a stipulated period of time.

The new transfer policy would apply to officials in the rank of inspector, sub-inspector and assistant sub-inspector.

The spokesman said constables, head constables and ASIs would not be posted in their home tehsils whereas SIs and Inspectors would not be posted in their home districts. Officials occupying sensitive posts, which involved largescale public dealing, would be shifted from their post after two years positively. After the cumulative stay of an NGO in a particular range for 10 years he must be shifted out of the range within the zone by the IGP/Zonal. In case any other ranks (ORs) or NGOs facing a deptt enquiry or criminal case, should not be shifted out to ensure unimpeded completion of the enquiry or investigation.

18,Rudy rules out privatisation of AAI,"PATNA:The union civil avitation minister, Rajiv Pratap Rudy on Thursday ruled out the possibility of privatisation of the Airport Authority of India(AAI).

Rudy said that the government had only decided to float a joint venture with shares from AAI and private parties.

He said that the AAI would have 26 per cent share in the joint venture while the remaining 74 per cent would be shared by the private bidders having experience of constructing and running international airports.

The bid of private parties would be subject to security clearance as well as clearance from the empowered committee comprising a group of unmion ministers.

Allaying the fear of AAI staff including engineers and pilots regarding their possible retrenchment after the formation of the joint venture, Rudy said that not a single staff would be retrenched despite the formation of the joint venture.

The civil aviation minister, however, said that the AAI staff would be sent on deputation for three years to the joint venture.

After completion of the deputation period the AAI staff would have the option of either getting absorbed in the new venture provided they were selected or returning to the parent body.

Strongly disapproving of the ''go slow'' strike by the AAI staff since September 17 in protest against the alleged move of the Vajpayee government to privatise the AAI, Rudy said that the government had decided to float a joint venture to upgrade the Delhi and Mumbai international airports as genuine world class international airports on the pattern of Singapore, Frankfurt(Germany) and Heathrow(London) airports.

The concerned file was pending disposal for the past four years, he added.

Requesting the AAI staff to call off their strike, Rudy said that the decision to form a joint venture was part of the economic reforms ushered in by the Vajpayee government during the past five years, Rudy said that development of Mumbai and Delhi airports into a genuine world class international airports would help the two cities develop into big world class towns with thriving economy.

It would also give a big boost to the tourism in the country. Their profit would increase, he said.

While admitting that the Mumbai and Delhi airports were still international airports, Rudy said that under the new plan both the airports would have more escalators, rest house besides several other facilities.

The minister said that as of now the AAI was not in a position to take up the upgradation of big airports like Delhi and Mumbai as it had to take care of altogether 146 airports.

Rudy while maintaining that there was absolutely no reason for the AAI staff to panic, said that even the Karnataka government was constructing an international airport at Bangalore while the Andhara Pradesh government was constructing an international airport at Shamshabad.

Rudy also demanded a 800 acre plot near Patna from the state government to develop Patna airport into a world class international airport.

He indicated that the centre was not favour constructing such an airport at Bihta in Patna district as proposed by the state government.

19,"ESI plan to cover drug purchase, equipment upkeep","NEW DELHI: Many states have accepted the new schemes proposed by the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) to improve the scheme, under consideration by the state labour and health ministers conference which began here on Thursday.

Encouraged by the success of the revolving fund system for the purpose of speciality and super-speciality treatments in ESI hospitals, the labour ministry is contemplating extending the facility for purchase of drugs and dressings and maintenance of equipment.

Since the scope of the fund can be expanded only with the consent of the state governments, the Centre is awaiting their response, Union labour minister Sahib Singh said, inaugurating the conference here.

The director-general of the ESI Corporation, Ajay Dua, had told The Times of India earlier that certain amendment to the ESIC Act has to be brought about in order extend the ESI services to a larger number of working population who are not in a position to enjoy its benefits at present.

He said the improvement in the service delivery under the ESI schemes would be possible only after the state governments cooperate with the Centre. Among the new proposals made by the ESI are inclusion of service sectors like private educational institutions, transport sector and shops and establishments.

The ESI is a social security scheme meant to provide protection to workers in the organised sector and their dependents in contingencies, such as sickness, maternity or death and disablement due to an employment injury or occupational disease.

20,New 'Navnirman' man target of govt's ire,"AHMEDABAD: Unnerved by the seemingly distant possibility of the college teachers'' agitation snowballing into a peoples'' movement against the Modi government in Gujarat, the state government is gunning for the spearhead of the agitation, Prof K S Shastri, a man who thinks the agitation could even turn into a new ''Navnirman'' agitation.

Now, the word ''Navnirman'' does rattle any government simply because this student-teacher led agitation culminated in the ouster of the then Chimanbhai Patel government in the mid-70s.

So,why is the government afraid of Shastri?

As the president of the Gujarat State University and College Teachers'' Association, Shastri is now trying to enrol the support of not only students but also all sections of society, including lawyers, farmers and those who are upset with the government on various counts.

According to sources, the government was planning to expose alleged financial irregularities indulged in by Shastri during his tenure as the V-C as well as the director of SLIMS.

SLIMS is the Som Lalit Institute of Management Studies, which has recently run into controversy because of overcharging students.

In another instance of growing concern of the ruling clique over Shastri''s clout with the teachers and his organisational skills, members of Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), burnt the effigy of Shastri on Thursday at the Gujarat University campus on Thursday.

They were protesting against the work-to-rule agitation spearheaded by Shastri that has hampered academic work in several colleges across the state.

However, the man at the centre of the controversy, sat unruffled in his camp just outside GU campus, with his campaign entering into the 38th day.

Ask him if these events will affect the teachers'' agitation, and he coolly retorts ""There is no question of going back this time.""

The government feels that Shastri has resorted to this agitation to deflect attention from controversies surrounding him.

""Certain vested interests after being embroiled in the issue of excess fee for MBA course, have brewed this campaign,"" state education minister Anandiben Patel said in an oblique reference to Shastri, in a recent meeting of V-Cs and heads of institutes.

She directed all those present, to take strict action against teachers who join the agitation.

But the government stance notwithstanding, sources say, there was no denying the fact that the man who ruled the Gujarat University with an iron hand, first as a V-C from 1981-87 and again as a pro-VC from 1997-2000, has returned to hog the limelight.

""Just when people though he had lost his credibility among teachers, he begins this campaign,"" a teacher said on condition of anonymity.

Many say he was also instrumental both in forcing government to revoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against striking administrative staff in state universities and also thwarting the passing of the Common Universities Act without discussion in 2002.

Those close to Shastri, say that attempts to corner him by first kicking him out of the GU and than trying to derecognise MBA course in his institute, have rebounded on the government.

""He might have had a failed political career when he lost election on a Congress ticket in 1990, but he certainly is not willing to loosen his stranglehold on Gujarat University politics,"" a source said.

Observers are now keenly watching the preparations for the September 21 convention under the banner of MahaGujarat NavNirman Front, which sources feel is being promoted by Shastri to get back at the government by joining forces with other disgruntled groups.
