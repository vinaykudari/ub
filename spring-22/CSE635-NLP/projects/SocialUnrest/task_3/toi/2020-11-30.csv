0,Hotel owner's killer arrested,"NEW DELHI: The crime branch of Delhi Police on Sunday arrested the man who shot down hotel owner Dilip Surtani outside his Safdurjung Enclave residence on Friday.

According to the police, the assailant, Manoj Kumar (25), fired the first shot at Surtani. It missed him, after which Kumarâ€™s accomplice Jagwinder shot Surtani twice in the chest. Jagwinder is still absconding.

A dispute over the victimâ€™s property at Aaya Nagar in Mehrauli, reportedly, led to his killing. The police said Surtaniâ€™s 6,000-sq-yard plot in Aaya Nagar had become a bone of contention between him and another property dealer, Tule Ram, based in Gurgaon. â€˜â€˜Surtani had bought the land through Tule Ram. Ram, however, had occupied a part of the land and constructed shops on it. Surtani recently got these shops demolished. He also wanted to sell a part of the property, which was resisted by Ram,â€™â€™ said DCP (crime) Dependra Pathak.

The police have arrested another accomplice Manoj Yadav, a resident of Gurgaon. The two locally-made pistols were seized from his residence. â€˜â€˜We zeroed in on Manoj Kumar after a tipoff that he had been noticed with Tule Ram a day before the incident. He is involved in a number notorious crimes. His fingerprints matched the prints lifted from the abandoned motorcycle and Surtaniâ€™s car,â€™â€™ said Pathak.

1,Congress could rig council polls: AIPJD,"MYSORE: State AIPJD president K.N. Nagegowda on Sunday expressed fears that Congress leaders will rig Mondayâ€™s election to the legislative council from the local bodies constituencies. He accused the state election commission of remaining silent over the matter.

At a press meet here, he said that he has written to the state election commission on the possibility of Congress leaders rigging the election and influencing voters by various means. â€œBut it has kept its eyes shut to the all wrongdoings of Congress leaders,â€� he alleged, adding that Congress leaders are desperate to win the elections.

He said that Congress leaders have already begun purchasing votes and there is every possibility of liquor playing a major role.

He said that the Congress government in the state has miserably failed to utilise the central funds meant for rural development works.

This has created a scare among Congress leaders that they might the election from the local bodies constituencies.

Referring to the allegation of the AIPJD having a secret pact with the Congress in the state in this election, Nagegowda said that in fact it was JD(S) leader H.D. Deve Gowda who hobnobs with both NDA leader George Fernandes and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

â€œLeaders who are making the allegation should reveal who had arranged a meeting between Deve Gowda and George Fernandes recently in Mysore,â€� he said. He was referring to Union minister Srinivasprasadaâ€™s outburst against his party.

Predicting that his party will win between 8 and 10 seats of the 25 seats which are at stake in this election to the state council, Nagegowda said that the election results will show which is the party emerging as an alternative to the Congress in Karnataka.

Replying to a question, he said that the leaders who have left AIPJD and joined the JD(S) are beginning to regret the lack of respect they showed for the party. They will soon be back in the AIPJD fold.

â€œI do not know whether Kolar MLAs are knocking at the doors of JD(S),â€� he said asking the journalists to put this question to Kolar MLAs themselves.

2,Parties blamed for communal unrest,"MANGALORE: The Kannada Nadu Party here has expressed concern over the growing communal intolerance and violence in Ullal.

Condemning the incidents, K. Mathai, organising secretary of the party stated that it was a matter of concern that communal violence in the district is increasing by the day. He stated the Kalladka violence following a murder, the Ullal violence after a torch rally by Hindu Hitarakshana Samiti, murders of autorickshaw drivers sent shockwaves among the people.

He said the incidents have started making people feel insecure and are losing faith in the police and government.

Mathai noted while one political party is involved in hyper-active political gimmicks in order to woo the votes of majority community, another is involved in appeasing the minority community. These have left, poor, helpless and innocent people of both the communities in the lurch, he observed.

Political parties must be responsible and should keep the interest of all communities in mind. Their leaders must be cautious and must not deliver provocative speeches which invite communal violence. Police must do their best to take preventive measures, he said.

He pointed out that politicians and ministers should not unnecessarily interfere in the working of the police for political gains. All political parties must immediately resort to confidence building measures.

Meanwhile, the Autorickshaw Chalakara Shramika Sangha and DK Auto rickshaw Chalakara Sangha have condemned the incidents and demanded suitable protection for the auto drivers.

They have also demanded suitable compensation to the family of the deceased.

3,Tight bandobast for by-election,"AHMEDABAD: The Jamalpur byelection here will be an acid test for the city police as well as the men in khadi for whom this is the litmus test for the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

The city police have been trying hard to maintain peace in a city whose denizens seem to be perpetually living on the edge.

Worries of the police are fuelled by a string of events: On November 2, three people were shot dead as communal tension gripped Viramgam. Curfew had to be clamped in the area to bring the situation under control.

On the same day, an incident of stone-throwing occurred at Bhilwas near Shah-e-Alam as a fall-out of the Viramgam episode.

Later at night 20-year-old Murad Fardurehman Shaikh was stabbed by miscreants near Bhulabhai Park crossroads. He died at the L G Hospital.

On November 7, rioting erupted in the Shah-e-Alam area after a Muslim was beaten up and robbed near Bhulabhai Park. One person, Mukesh Panchal, was stabbed to death during heavy stone-throwing and torching of a scooter. Five men were injured in the incident.

On November 9, it was Kalupurâ€™s turn. One Porus Mehta was burnt to death and seven were injured. On November 12, a blast at the busy Nehrunagar crossroads injured 14 people.

However, Ahmedabad police commissioner KR Kaushik said, â€œAll arrangements have been made to ensure that polling passes off peacefullyâ€�.

A large number of the 132 booths â€” 85 in Kagdapith, Danilimda and 47 in Gaekwad Haveli â€” have been declared as â€˜sensitiveâ€™ by the state election office.

Eleven sections of SRP and Border Wing jawans along with 626 constables and head constables, 75 woman constables, 49 PSIs, 22 PIs and DCP have been placed in charge of security during the polling.

Additional CP (Sector II) Keshav Kumar said, â€œSeven police mobile units would be patrolling the 85 booths and if required will act as Quick Response Teams (QRT) in any exigency.â€�

DCP (Zone III) A K Pandya,who is incharge of security in the 47 Gaekwad Haveli polling booths too is not taking any chances.

Every multi-storeyed building has been placed under surveillance.

Police inspectors have been placed to man security from rooftop of each of the 15 buildings, so that the vantage points are not misused by miscreants. Patrolling has also been stepped up. However, if one goes by the words of GPCC office-bearers, â€˜the bandobast is inadequateâ€™.

They have shot off a letter to the chief election officer complaining of police excesses and demanding deployment of more forces for the conduct of free and fair polls.

The Congressmen have cited an example of police excess: Policemen allegedly beat up Congress workers at the Chhipa Community Hall in Jamalpur and four victims had allegedly been admitted to the V S Hospital.

The police, however, clarified,â€œ Some men were gambling at this spot. They were chased away by the police.â€�

Congress leaders also alleged that party workers were being illegally detained by the police and that the state government was misusing its powers to bog down the opponents. Attempts were also made to meet officials of the Crime Branch in this regard.

DCP Pandya however said: â€œWe have only made preventive arrests.â€� Police said only those who are considered to be potential trouble-makers with criminal background have been rounded up on eve of polls.â€�

4,"After polls, focus on Pakistan","NEW DELHI: After the assembly elections on Monday, the PM and his teamâ€™s immediate attention will be on the winter session of Parliament beginning on Tuesday, and relations with Pakistan.

Parliament is likely to be a predictable affair, with lots of faux drama and feigned anger, but the real challenge in the coming weeks will be the opening up of yet another prospect of mending relations with Pakistan.

The Vajpayee government has had a roller-coaster ride on Pakistan. Beginning February 1999 with the dramatic Lahore summit, it has seen a war in Kargil, the Kandahar hijack, the Agra summit, the fallout of 9/11, the terrorist strike on Parliament, and the inconclusive Operation Para-karam. Now with a distinct â€˜â€˜Iâ€™ve been here beforeâ€™â€™ sense, the cycle is back to dialogue.

After having achieved as much as they did in Lahore in 1999, the question is: How do we recapture the spirit of Lahore? Clearly, it takes more than just willingness to talk. It requires a certain ambience that seems to be absent when the generals are in charge.

All the nice things are said by PM Jamali and company, but the real bosses, Musharraf and his corps commanders, donâ€™t say much. Even at the popular level, there is a divide summed up by the Pakistani belief that if Kashmir is resolved, the two countries will be friends. Indians realise that until the two are friends, Kashmir canâ€™t be settled.

Vajpayee who has single-handedly carried his governmentâ€™s Pakistan policy contemplates the dilemma: Will Pakistan have to change before meaningful talks can be held, or will dialogue aid the process of change?

Almost everyone agrees on what needs to be changed: The military-dominated polity of the country.

5,Robber killed during break-in at farmhouse,"PUNE: Three robbers attacked the farmhouse of one Rohidas Pawar (35) at Phursungi, Loni-Kalbhor, in the early hours of Sunday. However, one of them was killed after Pawar fired from his rifle in self-defence.

According to the Loni-Kalbhor police, Rohidasâ€™ parents, Mahadev (60) and Parvati (50), were sleeping outside the house, when the robbers entered their farmhouse around 3 am. They started beating them with a sickle and sticks.

They later managed to enter the house after breaking open the door latch. They removed jewellery and some cash from a cupboard and started to look for more, the police said.

The commotion woke up Rohidas, who was sleeping upstairs. He came down with his rifle and fired in the air to scare away the robbers.

However, when Rohidas realised that the robbers were charging at him, he fired in their direction, injuring one of them in the chest. The other two then dragged their injured accomplice out, but later left him to die in a nearby farm.

Rohidasâ€™ parents were rushed to a hospital in the city after being treated at a local hospital. Mahadev was injured in his face and is in an intensive care unit, while Parvati, who suffered injuries on her hand, has been admitted to the general ward.

Police inspector Shirish Shinde said that the robber who died was around 20 years old. â€œHowever, his identity could not be established,â€� he added.

He said dog squads were used, but they could not proceed beyond a canal, which passes through the farm. â€œTeams have been sent to Phaltan and Baramati as they had certain leads, but itâ€™s too early to say anything,â€� Shinde added.

â€œAt the local level, we are checking the records of history-sheeters, however, there are no known suspects,â€� he said. Shinde said the rifle from which Pawar had fired was a licensed weapon.

At the time of the incident, apart from Rohidasâ€™ parents, his wife, son and brother were present in the house, but nobody was hurt as they had not come out of their room.

The police have registered an offence under section 394 of the Indian Penal Code which amounts to voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery, and under section 452, which is for house-trespass after preparation for hurt and assault.

8,Principal’s post: UGC refuses to ease rules,"CHANDIGARH: The University Grants Commission (UGC), in its latest communication to Panjab University (PU), has clearly refused to allow any relaxation in qualification for the appointment of college principals. PhD or any published research work equivalent to it would continue to remain the minimum qualification for the appointment.

Rejecting PUâ€™s proposal for granting a five-year relaxation to those principals who have work experience of more than 25 years, the UGC has reiterated that no relaxation would be given as â€˜â€˜the decision had been taken after detailed deliberations on the issue. Every university, state and college is bound to follow it as minimum qualifications are mandatory in nature.â€™â€™

PU had earlier constituted a syndicate committee to examine the â€˜â€˜issue of equivalence of published work with PhD for all purposes, which also holds true for the appointment of a college principalâ€™â€™.

The five-member committee decided that the published work of minimum of five papers in a national and international journal or an original research book would be accepted. It was also decided that the work would be referred to two referees to be nominated by the vice-chancellor.

The referees would belong to the same discipline in which work is published and their expert opinion would be sought. The recommendations would then be placed before the relevant selection committee which would eventually decide on whom to appoint the principal.

It was also decided in the meeting that members of the panel headed by S C Marriya would meet the UGC chairperson to press for the relaxation of condition. Ho-wever, all the efforts have now gone waste as the UGC is not convinced with PUâ€™s contention.

The UGC decision regarding the appointment of principals had been a topic of discussion in the university, yet it never found whole-hearted support as the faculty thought that no importance was given to the teaching experience of a principal as doctorate had been made the sole criteria for appointment.

Among their other major fears was the non-availability of PhD holders in all disciplines. Many faculty members are of the opinion that there are more PhDs in languages and humanities than pure sciences where a lesser number of scholars are able to procure their doctorates.

9,New law spells doom for workers,"MUMBAI: Shantiram Kulkarni, 45, has been fighting a ten-year legal battle to get his work and salary dues back from the Mumbai-based Ruby Coach Builders Ltd.

Last year, however, his chances of doing so dwindled even further when a new national legislation allowed the Dena Bank, which had given a loan to the company, to take over the firm to recover its money.

â€œThere has been no move by the bank to restart the company and make it a going concern again,â€™â€™ says Mr Kulkarni, a father of two boys and one girl,who used to earn almost Rs 5,000 in the company, â€œThe bank can sell the factory and get their money back but what about us?â€™â€™ Labour groups on Tuesday called for changes in the new laws governing debt recovery by banks and financial institutions, saying that it did not take care of the ordinary workers in closed and defaulting industrial units.

The new lawâ€”known as the Sarfesi Act, or the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest, 2002â€”is supposed to help banks recover bad debts and cancel out â€˜non-performing assetsâ€™.

â€œUnfortunately only the interest of the creditor is taken care of,while the workers are left high and dry,â€™â€™ said Pius Varghese, president of the Rashtriya Kamgar Sanghatna, at a press conference on Tuesday. â€œThe units are shut down, and neither the workersâ€™wages nor their terminal benefits are being paid.â€™â€™

Activists said that many of the cases pertain to industrial units which have been locked out or closed for several years. â€œIt is well-known that many company owners take loans and then siphon the money off, leaving the units to collapse,â€™â€™ said Mr Varghese, adding that when the banks take over the units they should ensure proper management so that they can become profit-making concerns again.

If the assets are to be sold, then some of the proceeds should go towards paying the workers, he added.

Activist Vivek Pandit also noted that in the context of declining industrial employment, there needs to be better social security including health and education cover for the increasing number of workers in the informal and unorganised sector.

10,Nakkavagu: A stream of misery for farmers,"HYDERABAD: Malavatti Pentayya is a third-generation farmer from Pocharam. However, unlike his father and grandfather, he does not cultivate the most profitable crop in the region â€” paddy.

For the past 15 years, he has been growing beedi leaves on his four-acre field.

â€œThe water is not good for paddy cultivation,â€� he says. Until two decades ago, farmers in Pocharam and neighbouring villages used to irrigate their fields with water from the Nakkavagu.

â€œWe can no longer use the stream as the water has many chemicals,â€� Pentayya explains.

The common effluent treatment plant located on the outskirts of the village discharges the treated effluents into the stream. The plant treats all the liquid effluents discharged by factories in the Patancheru industrial area.

According to environmentalist K Purushottam Reddy, the soil in the region is very fertile and ideal for paddy cultivation.

There is no dearth of ground water either. â€œHowever, both the soil and the water have been polluted irrevocably by the industries in the region,â€� Reddy said.

He has been fighting for the cause of the farmers and the pollution-affected people of Patancheru for more than 15 years.

Officials at the effluent treatment plant maintain that the treated water let out into the stream is suitable for irrigation. The farmersâ€™ experience proves otherwise.

S Anjayya lost two acres of paddy when he used the ground water. His cattle died after drinking the water of the Nakkavagu.

Most of the water from Nakkavagu seeps into the soil. The effluents in the water alter the chemistry of the soil, damaging its fertility.

No land on either side of the stream is suitable for cultivation any longer, local people say.

â€œIndustrialisation has only benefited the government by increasing revenue,â€� Reddy said. â€œThe factories have come up on fertile agricultural land. They damage the soil and do not even provide employment to the local people,â€� he added.

â€œBy polluting the water and soil around the agriculture land, the industries have deprived farmers of their livelihood,â€� he said. â€œThe industries are directly responsible for the death of farmers who have no land to live on,â€� he added.

A study by a senior scientist at Central Research Institute for Dry land Agriculture (CRIDA), Kaushalya Ramachandra, shows that in 1971, 62 per cent of the land surrounding Hyderabad was being irrigated.

11,Sharma decides to skip farewell party,"MUMBAI: Former Mumbai police commissioner R.S. Sharma was grilled for the fourth time by the Special Investigating Team in connection with the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam on Sundayâ€”the day of his retirement.

Said a senior IPS officer, â€œIt is a major embarrassment for Mr Sharma as his questioning came on a day when his IPS colleagues had planned to give him a ceremonial farewell.â€™â€™ However, Mr Sharma failed to turn up at the late-night party at the Officersâ€™Mess, situated next to the SIT office in Worli where he was grilled earlier in the day. A section of IPS officers boycotted the party as they â€œdid not wish to be associated with a tainted police officerâ€™â€™.

Mr Sharmaâ€™s questioning on Sunday began at 11.30 a.m. and continued until 1.45 p.m. He refused to speak to mediapersons while leaving the SIT office in his private Indigo.He was accompanied by his former liaisoning officer, inspector Rajendra Chavan.

The interrogation was conducted by SIT chief S.S. Puri and deputy inspector-general Subodh Jaiswal. Sources said that Mr Sharma was asked more than 50 questions, most of which pertained to his â€œclose proximityâ€™â€™ to former Pune assistant commissioner M.C.Mulani.

Mr Mulani has been accused of demanding a bribe of Rs 3 crore from scam kingpin Abdul Telgi in a case registered by Bund Garden police station in Pune in November 2001. Mr Sharma was the Pune police commissioner when the case was being investigated in 2002.

In a court affidavit, former Pune additional commissioner S.M.Mushrif had alleged that Mr Mulani,who was close to the police commissioner, had accepted Rs 15 lakhs from Telgi for not taking action against the latterâ€™s family members. The SIT has already questioned Mr Mushrif in this connection. Meanwhile, the SIT may expedite investigations as it has about only 45 days before the court decides (on January 16, 2004) whether the probe should be handed over to the CBI. The SIT has arrested about 60 persons in the scam and is likely to make more arrests in December. Santosh Bane

13,GenNext gives polls a miss,"NEW DELHI: The best citizens were clearly the elderly. And, of course, the ones whose fates hang in balance in the four states where elections were held on Monday. What began as a trickle, became a respectable 55 per cent voter turnout in the end, but the disinterest of the young was marked.

Much of Delhi seemed to treat election day as a holiday, happily extending the weekend. By noon on Monday, polling booths in most parts of the city reported only a trickle of voters. Most of these were the elderly of the area, conscientiously walking up to cast their vote.

It could be the chilly December morning. It could be the fact that many voters just did not think it worth their while to exercise their franchise. Enthusiasm was low at most places, including star constituencies like Gole Market and Moti Nagar, one of which will give the Capital its next chief minister. The voter turnout was better in some booths in outer Delhi and the old Delhi.

Voters started to come in only later to register a good turnout by the end of the day. Of course, the apathy of the voter was made up for by the energy of the lumpen element, out for the day.

An agitated Shiela Dikshit alleged the Azads, MP Kirti and his wife Poonam who is contesting against the chief minister, had roughed up Congress workers. ""Even Kirti Azad slapped a worker,"" she alleged. The Congress has already filed a complaint against Poonam Azad. Azad made similar noises.

In Moti Nagar, where Dikshit''s pet hate Madan Lal Khurana hopes to win, too there were scuffles as allegations flew. There were reports from Damoh in Madhya Pradesh too about BJP and Congress workers clashing.

A woman was killed, caught in crossfire between two groups in Madhya Pradesh and Naxalites snatched electronic voting machines in Chhattisgarh.

And the histrionics. Alka Lamba, a Congress unknown contesting against Khurana, sought her giant adversary''s blessings by touching his feet. Going by Lamba''s grumbles, Khurana was not much inclined to.

VIP voters began early, though the nations''s first citizen, President A P J Abdul Kalam, who was away rushed back to the city to vote at 4.30 pm.

Congress President Sonia Gandhi cast her vote at the Nirman Bhavan polling booth and declared: ""We will have to wait till December 4, but we will do well."" She was accompanied by a nervous Dikshit who herself voted only after her leader had. Daughter Priyanka Vadra voted in Lodi Colony and talked politics.

Khurana had voted by noon, so had the BJP royal Vasundhara Raje in Jhalawar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh Uma Bharati and Chief Minister Digvijay Singh in his bastion, Raghogarh. A twinkle in the eye, if this chief minister was nervous, he was not showing it as he quoted from the Gita and insisted he would be third time lucky.

14,Sporadic violence on election day,"NEW DELHI: Four persons were injured in a clash at Bhatti Mines in Mehrauli. In another incident, a Congress worker was injured in R K Puram during the assembly election on Monday.

Other areas remained largely peaceful except for a few stray incidents of scuffles between party workers.

Chief minister Sheila Dikshit complained that BJP workers had roughed up her nephew. Delhi Police arrested one person in East Delhi district and three persons in the New Delhi district under preventive sections.

The Bhatti Mines incident started at about 11 am after an argument over â€˜â€˜identifyingâ€™â€™ a woman voter who was covering her face with a veil. Police officials present on the spot said the problem started when Burfi Devi, an elderly resident of Bada Bhatti village came to vote. â€˜â€˜A BJP worker insisted on identifying her with her I-card. But the men accompanying her got upset, since the women in the area use a purdah,â€™â€™ said a voter.

The argument allegedly went out of hand with Congress and BJP supporters pelting stones at each other. Four persons received head injuries and 20 were detained. There was panic in the area with the police rushing additional forces, including personnel from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), to bring the situation under control.

The presiding officer of the booth however claimed that polling did not stop and the incident occurred outside the premises of the polling booth. The police had detained about 15 people by afternoon.

In R K Puram, supporters of independent candidate Hiren Tokas allegedly roughed up Congress district general secretary Rajinder Rathore.

Minor clashes were reported between BJP and Congress supporters at a polling station in Shahbad Daulatpur. The problem started when senior Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, whose brother Ramesh Kumar is the party candidate from the constituency, entered a polling station with armed security guards. Supporters of BJP candidate Kulwant Rana created a ruckus saying that Sajjan Kumar was trying to delay the election process.

In Paharganj too, BJP candidate Virender Babbar complained that Congress supporters roughed him up. â€˜â€˜I am going to complain to the police,â€™â€™ he said.

There was a false alarm over â€˜â€˜booth capturingâ€™â€™ in Matia Mahal. Booths number 66 and 68 were reportedly captured by Congress workers, according to a complaint lodged by Janata Dal (secular) workers. However, the complaint was found to be a false alarm. Despite heavy police presence, a heated argument broke out when Congress general secretary Ahmad Patel made an appearance.

15,"Stray violence, failed EVMs","NEW DELHI: Incidents of group clashes, booth-capturing, snatching of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and flooding of a polling station marked polling for the assembly elections in four states.

While in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, there were reports of booth-capturing and damage to the EVMs, a breach in a canal in Lunkaransahar in Jodhpur led to the flooding of a polling station.

Based on tentative reports, deputy election commissioner Ajay Narayan Jha said on Monday evening that repoll would be ordered in 24 polling booths in Chhattisgarh, 23 in Madhya Pradesh and nine in Rajasthan. â€˜â€˜The repoll figures could go up when the final reports of the presiding officers and observers come to us by Tuesday,â€™â€™ Jha said.

The repoll will be held on December 3, he said. According to Jha, Rajasthan reported 60 per cent polling followed by MP and Chhattisgarh with 55 to 58 per cent polling. Delhi was the lowest at 48 to 50 per cent.

In Chhattisgarh, Jha said Left-wing extremist groups did not allow polling parties to reach eight polling stations in Dantewara. â€˜â€˜We have received reports of snatching and damage to EVMs,â€™â€™ he said. In Rajnandgaon, he added, EVMs did not work due to a mechanical failure.

In Madhya Pradesh, cases of booth-capturing and damage to EVMs were reported from Morena, Sagar, Dhar, Tikamgarh and Satna. In Bhopal, an EVM was broken while the poll was boycotted in one area in the Balaghat assembly constituency. In Rajasthan, violence was low key as only nine cases have been reported.

In the Capital, Jha said, stray incidents of group clashes were reported from Mehrauli. â€˜â€˜On inquiry, we found that no firing had taken place in the area,â€™â€™ he said. He also said that a report about the presiding officer in the Nasirpur polling booth accepting money from a poll agent was found to be baseless. â€˜â€˜She had actually given a currency note of a large denomination to the agent for change,â€™â€™ Jha clarified.

Jha also denied reports of large scale failure of EVMs. â€˜â€˜Initially we received reports of EVMs not functioning, but we found that most did not work because of the manner in which they were handled. By 9 am, polling had begun,â€™â€™ he said adding that only â€˜â€˜25 to 30 out of the two lakh EVMs did not function.â€™â€™

Polling for the byelections to two assembly constituencies, Jamalpur in Gujarat and Tiruvalla in Kerala, also went off peacefully. Jha said that more than 90 per cent polling was reported from the local authorities constituencies in the legislative council elections in Karnataka, Maharashtra and UP.

16,More development equals less voting,"NEW DELHI: Monday morning, and the media was full of messages exhorting citizens to get out and vote. Columnists urged voters to exercise their franchise, newspapers published ads to the effect, and celebrities spoke of the importance of the ballot.

It was all very inspiring. So inspiring, in fact, that it almost drowned out that cynical little voice which pointed out that people only have to be coaxed to do things theyâ€™d rather not do. Think about it. Nobody ever has to motivate you to do something that you enjoy doing. So if such a concerted effort has to be made to get people to the polling booth, it only means that they find it an ordeal to do so.

The numbers bear that out. In Delhi, voter turnout was 50.62 per cent for the 1996 Lok Sabha election. By 1999, the figure had dropped to 43.54 per cent. Likewise, it was barely 49 per cent in the 1998 assembly elections and 48 to 50 per cent this time.

Politicians, who fall all over themselves to be photographed casting their votes, may express dismay at this trend. But then votes are the currency in which they trade, so it obviously makes sense for them to ensure that it is not devalued. Celebrities who turn up in ads may cluck their tongues, but then, how many of them actually turn up to vote themselves?

Commentators may lament that this indicates a decline in public participation in the democratic process. But hereâ€™s another interesting set of statistics: the all-India average voter turnout is about 60 per cent, so Delhi fares â€˜worseâ€™ than the rest of India. But it still does significantly â€˜betterâ€™ than the US, where only 36.4 per cent of voting population showed up at the 1998 Congressional elections.

The obvious correlation: economic prosperity goes hand-in-hand with declining interest in polls. In an underdeveloped economy, citizens see voting as a form of empowerment. In a developed economy, there are many other venues for empowerment. Besides, there are far lower expectations from the government. Most people see it as a nuisance to be tolerated, at best, and an obstruction to enterprise at worst.

Inevitably, there are exceptions. So, this yearâ€™s California polls saw almost 60 per cent voter turnout, an abnormally high figure by that stateâ€™s standards. But that was largely because the state found itself in an economic crisis. Voter apathy results when there is a broad consensus between parties on desirable policies and life is stable â€” the perfect setting for economic development. Voters are stirred either at times of social/economic/ political crisis, or when one party is peddling an extremist ideology â€” and such situations are rarely good for business.

So lots of people decided not to vote. Well, that was an expression of choice too. Maybe they chose to go to the offices that stayed open, or work out of home, and thus contribute to economic productivity. Does that make them any less patriotic?
