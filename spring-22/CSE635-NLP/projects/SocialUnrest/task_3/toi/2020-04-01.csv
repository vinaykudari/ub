0,NCP shuffle aimed at assembly polls,"MUMBAI: ""TV producers are primarily concerned about ratings, but so am I,"" says Irwin â€˜Sonny'' Fox. An old and distinguished hand in the television business,Mr Fox was in the city recently to speak at a â€˜Soap Summit'' meeting organised by the BBC World Service Trust (BBCWST).

He discussed with representatives from Star, Sony, Zee and other Indian TV channels the possibilities of replicating in India the Soap Summit held annually in the US, which awards entertaining television serials that stimulate social change.

Mr Fox is currently chairman of the board of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) in the US, as well as senior vice president of Population Communications International (PCI).

He wasn''t here to ask TV serialwallahs to be decent sorts, think of the nation and squeeze social messages in their serials. ""We don''t want TV producers to do good, but rather to do good because it makes their scripts more interesting,"" he emphasises.

""India''s population exceeds a billion and it has terrible problems. Media people are not always aware that they can be powerful agencies for social change, and we''re hoping to alter that.""

Soap Summits have been held in the US since 1993. Awards are given by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, at a gala ceremony in Los Angeles to TV serials making the most social impact, followed by a session at the UN in New York. The summits are a collaboration between the CDC, PCI and TV networks.

""The CDC works with the writers of a number of popular TV serials, including â€˜ER'', â€˜Friends'' and â€˜The Bold and the Beautiful''. It''s not a question of bunging in a social message, but weaving it into your characters'' behaviour so that the public cares about the issue,"" Mr Fox explains.

""We have had results that were measurable. For instance, in an episode of The Bold and the Beautiful, one character, Tony, is diagnosed as HIV positive. In a single hour following the airing, the CDC monitored 1,426 calls over an HIV hotlineâ€”16 times more than in the hour preceding the serial."" He also gives the instance of the serial Friends.

""There is a sequence in which two young women sharing an apartment are planning to have sex with their boyfriends that night, but find there''s only one condom left in the bathroom. One takes the condom, and the other decides not to have sex that night, sending out a clear messageâ€”no condom, no sex. But it''s done in a very comic scene, with the guys wondering what''s going on in the bathroom.""

Mr Fox also holds workshops help to sensitise TV serial writers to the messages they send out all the time, on the status of women, sex, health and teenagers.""For instance, I got them to talk to teenage fathers, people who have attempted suicide, and a woman who had been jailed for murdering her husband, following years of domestic abuseâ€”so the writers can sense their power to change.""

PCI has been involved in entertainment education in India for two decades. It collaborated in the making of the TV serials â€˜Hum Log'' and â€˜Humraahi'', aimed at popularising family planning and empowering women. In 1995, PCI started a radio serial â€˜Tinka Tinka Sukh'' (Little Steps to a Better Life) that focussed on empowering women, that reportedly received 1.5 lakh letters from listeners.

Meanwhile, the BBC WST is itself supporting a detective serial Jasoos Vijay on Doordarshan, that also deals with AIDS. Mr Fox knows from long experience that he may not see dramatic social change before his eyes. But, as he puts it, ""If you''re talking to 100 people in a room, there won''t be 100 epiphanies, but it is important to plant that seed anyway.""

1,City incinerator coughs up a controversy,"MUMBAI: A thick layer of soot settles on the front door and tiny verandah of Sangeeta Khodkeâ€™s home in Sewriâ€™s Dyaneshwar Nagar every time the municipality switches on its central bio-medical waste incinerator, located in a nearby tuberculosis hospital.

Scrubbing the dirt away with soap and water is a chore Ms Khodke has learnt to take in her stride.What she still canâ€™t come to grips with is the chronic coughing of her two children. â€œWe are forced to breathe in this thick soot. See what it has done to us,â€™â€™Ms Khodke said, pointing to her seven-year-old daughter Sayali, who is having a coughing fit.

The Khodkes and other families in the area have seen their lives change perceptibly ever since the incinerator was installed with much fanfare a year ago. The central incinerator handles medical waste from all public and private hospitals that do not have their own disposal facilities.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that health standards have deteriorated ever since the â€œshowers of blackâ€™â€™, as one resident described the phenomenon, began descending from the skies. Said local doctor Ijaz Kalshekar, â€œOver the last six months, I have seen a sharp rise in allergic bronchitis among my patients.â€™â€™

The symptoms include breathlessness, irritation of the throat and fever. Children and the old are among the worst-hit, he said. As if to confirm this observation, schools in the locality are reporting increasing absenteeism. Madhavi Apte, principal Sewriâ€™s Dnyaneshwar High School said that her pupils often suffered from wheezing and attacks of breathlessness.

â€œOften, the soot enters our classrooms,â€™â€™ she said. The complaints have forced the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to sit up and take notice. An air-monitoring vehicle has been stationed at the site to record the levels of pollutants. The BMC has also started a house-to-house survey to guage the extent of the problem.

The results of the survey will be out in a week. Additional municipal commissioner S. Kunte, who is in charge of the health department, told TNN that â€œperhaps the filter of the chimney was faultyâ€™â€™. Local resident Reena Gawli has been livid ever since she learnt what the incinerator is being used for.

â€œI saw them unload foetuses, body organs, blood-soaked bandages and syringes from a truck. To think that we are breathing in the soot of such waste,â€™â€™ she declared.

2,Govt. to embark on ambitious watershed development plan,"PUNE: The state government plans to intensify its watershed development programme in 22,000 scarcity-hit villages and an equal number of hamlets from May 1, with a view to creating a â€œtanker-freeâ€� state in the next two years.

This was announced by Mohan Dharia, chief advisor, wasteland development mission of Maharashtra, at a press conference here on Tuesday. Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde will flag off the intensified watershed programme at Nagpur on May 1, he said.

According to Dharia, 140 villages and 641 hamlets in Pune district are facing water scarcity and 137 tankers have been pressed into service to supply water to them. Watershed development works like the construction of bunds, contour trenches, desilting of 44,000 percolation tanks and old water tanks will be undertaken in such villages on a priority basis, Dharia said.

â€œThe government has decided to use employment guarantee scheme funds for watershed works,â€� he added. The historic Mastani water tank near Pune too is to be desilted before June to increase its water storage capacity.

â€œWe have sought permission from the forest department and the department of archaeology for starting the work. The archaeology department wants to inspect the silt to ensure that nothing valuable gets thrown out,â€� he said.

About the â€œtanker-freeâ€� programme, Dharia said coordination committees will be constituted at the taluka and district levels to monitor it. Each block development officer has been asked to prepare a detailed watershed plan for his area which will be implemented on priority, he explained.

District collectors will supervise the work through a web-based monitoring system, to be launched within a week. Under the Mahatma Phule water conservation programme started by the state government last year, as many as 36,000 Vanrai bunds have been constructed.

Other water conservation projects are also in progress, Dharia said, adding that Rs 250 crore have been invested in these in terms of human labour alone. Best-performing districts, blocks and villages in the campaign will win awards.

3,State effects change in impact fee rules,"GANDHINAGAR: The state government has discontinued the earlier system of regularising illegal construction in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar by levying hefty impact fee, and has now introduced the new system under which illegal properties would be assessed on lump-sum basis and not based on the built-up area.

State urban development minister I K Jadeja,while giving details of the Bill passed in the Assembly, said all complications in the rules of regularisation have been simplified. As a result, owners of small houses would benefit.

Accordingly, illegal construction on a 40-metre plot would have to pay only a token impact fee of Rs 1,000 for regularising the unauthorised construction.

While in case of plot admeasuring more than 40 and upto 150 metres, the impact fees will range between Rs 7,000 and 15,000.

The rules for regularising unauthorised buildings have been made following strong representations from owners of small flats and builders, officials of municipal corporations and urban development authorities had calculated impact fee haphazardly, i.e. to be recovered on the basis of Rs 2,000 per metre illegal construction and 400 per metre minimum charge of impact fee.

The minister said the government has left the issue parking to the housing colonies which have violated building by-laws.

5,Curfew in parts of Dahod after clash,"VADODARA: An indefinite curfew was clamped on parts of Dahod town late on Tuesday after five people sustained injuries in a clash between members of two communities. The condition of two of the injured is reportedly serious.

The incident occurred at 1.30 pm in an area adjoining Court Road.

An FIR filed with Dahod town police station alleged that a boy belonging to a minority community had teased a tribal girl.

Things went out of control after relatives of the girl had a tiff with the boy. People in the locality became excited and the tiff snowballed into a riot.

Two boys, around 20 years, were seriously injured. One was stabbed on the neck and the other was attacked on forehead by a sharp-edged weapon. Both were brought to Vadodara for treatment. Three others suffered minor injuries.

A team of police officials, including Dahod superintendent of police DJ Patel, rushed to the place.

Combing operations were launched and all 14 people, named in the FIR, were booked. Special IGP (Vadodara range) Deepak Swaroop said combing operations in the town were still on.â€œWe have arrested 16 others for trying to create troubles,â€� he added.

Swaroop said the incident might be the fallout of misbehavior by people in inebriated state. â€œSome people of the minority community were abused by them which led to trouble.

However, this has to be investigated,â€� he said.

â€œCurfew has been clamped on some parts of the town as a precautionary measure.The situation is under control,â€� he said. Areas from Court Road to Dabgarfalia and Gaushala are under curfew.

6,"Patkar, Pandey stopped from taking out rally","LUCKNOW: Nearly 100 activists of Desh Bachao Desh Banao campaign including NBA activist Medha Patkar were stopped from leaving the Charbagh station and kept waiting for almost the entire day.

It was alleged that the police officials misbehaved with Magsaysay award winner Sandeep Pandey of National Alliance of Peopleâ€™s Movement and offered no valid explanation for why they were stopped from taking a peaceful procession to Vidhan Sabha.

Patkar later met chief secretary DS Bagga and lodged a complaint against, what she called â€˜suppression of democratic voicesâ€™. The main agenda of the campaign, she said, was to fight against the fundamentalist forces and globalisation. The residents of Ayodhya and Faizabad have been the main victims of the polemics of religious intolerance and the mandir-masjid issue and have raised the demand for prioritising education, health, employment, right to natural resources instead.

Earlier in a meeting, nearly 1000 residents of Ayodhya and Faizabad participated in this campaign using it as a neutral platform to vent their grievances. Pandey reiterated this sentiment saying that the people were fed up with the constant curfews that had rung a death knell for traders. In addition to this, the city was plagued by the constant fear of harassment and victimisation.

They said that residents had rejected this mandir-masjid politics where the real culprits could incite communal violence through inflammatory statements. It was only after DS Bagga gave an assurance that their demands would be looked into that frayed tempers could be calmed. He said that the demands would be forwarded to the chief minister.

7,Anti-VAT bandh: Over 80 pc shops remain closed,"LUCKNOW: More than 80 per cent of shops and business establishments all over the state remained closed on Tuesday also, following a call for Bharat Bandh given by the traders against the move to impose value added tax (VAT).

Reports pouring in from all over the state showed that the traders preferred to down their shutters on the second consecutive day to voice their protest against the implementation of VAT.

While no violence was reported from any place, traders resorted to â€˜chakka jamâ€™ and preventing trains from moving in some districts. In some places, police arrested traders but later let them off.

The call for a two-day bandh was given by the Bharatiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal.

In Lucknow, shopkeepers of the two main market places, Hazratganj and Aminabad, as also those of the old city kept their business establishments closed. In some market places like Narhi, shops were found to be open. General secretary of the Bharatiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal Banwari Lal Kanchhal resorted to â€˜chakka jamâ€™ along with 300 other traders in the old city area. He along with 67 other protesting traders was arrested and later released.

According to principal secretary home Pradeep Kumar, traders burnt an effigy of VAT in Sultanpur. In the Balrampur district, 100 traders were arrested and later let off and in neighbouring Sant Kabir Nagar 20 traders were arrested for causing law and order problems.

8,Saharsa bandh against hooliganism,"SAHARSA: The entire market wore a deserted look as the traders downed their shutters on Tuesday in protest against the alleged hooliganism resorted to by an angry group of local youths going on rampage on Monday evening.

According to sources, a mason, Mohd Mobarak was crushed to death by a speeding vehicle near Islamia chowk here on Monday evening. A mob of local youths blocked the road traffic by laying the body on the main road and rushed menacingly towards the main market to forcibly close the shops and business establishments. When resisted by some traders, the angry mob went berserk, damaging some of the shops and injuring some of the shopkeepers in Gangjala Chowk and DB Road markets.

Taking strong exception to the alleged chaotic situation and failure of the police in curbing such hooliganism, the traders went on strike shutting their own shops.

The police patrolling has been intensified in the main market and the SP has assured to take suitable steps for the arrest of the rampaging youths.

The traders are also sore over the police failure in arresting the lone accused who is alleged to have brutally killed a young man, Raju Sharma, in broad daylight at Dahlan Chowk on Sunday evening. The sudden spurt in crime as raised an alarm in the district headquarter.

Seemanchal council sought: The two-day workers camp of Seemakhand Vikas Parishad, organised here on Saturday and Sunday, held the Union and the state government responsible for the economic backwardness of 16 bordering districts of Bihar and demanded an autonomous Seemakhand council.

Parishad president Shankar Azad, general secretary Prabhat Kumar and Ajay Purvey, while talking to newsmen after the conclusion of the camp, stressed on the need of peopleâ€™s participation in national planning and said that the development schemes imposed from above have failed to deliver goods to the people and hence the process should now be reversed. Suitable mechanism should be developed so as to ascertain the requirements of the villages and then frame the policies, they added.

Purvey opposed Union governmentâ€™s proposal to link up all the rivers in the country and said that it was nothing but an eyewash and an instrument of largescale loot of public money. He also opposed the idea of constructing high dams in the territory of other countries and warned that the Himalayan range, being a seismic zone, would perpetually be threatened by earthquakes and thus imminent danger of flood would keep lurking over peopleâ€™s head.

Azad did not favour the demand of a separate state but he warned that the growing disillusionment of the people and the continuing apathy of the public representatives may take any turn in future.

Chandan Kumar Bagchi, the Koshi division council general secretary and organiser of the camp, said that in near future all border-points would be sealed and traffic paralysed in all the districts along Nepal and Bangladesh borders if the demands of the council are not conceded.

9,Higher rates in govt hospitals hit the poor,"MYSORE: The overnight decision to increase rates of treatment and other services in government-run hospitals has not only shocked the poor patients, but turned away the middle-class too.

10,Three shot at; kidnapper arrested,"PATNA: Three persons were shot at and injured at Deepkula village under the Dhanarua police station of Patna district on Tuesday morning. Another Surendra Yadav was beaten up. All the injured persons including Ganesh Prasad Yadav, Sakaldeep Yadav and Ramashish Prasad Yadav have been admitted to PMCH.

According to the injured persons, the incident occurred when they were busy in getting electricity wire connection from a transformer for irrigating their field. They said they were ready to pay the electricity bill regularly. â€œSome villagers were opposed to our move to make the payment of electricity bill. They got the eletric wire removed from the pole,â€� informed one of the injured persons. He disclosed a group of villagers persuaded the authorities concerned to allow wiring. â€œOur move invited the wrath of other villagers who were reluctant to pay the bill,â€� another maintained while describing the reasons which led to the incident.

Tension has gripped the village and its adjoining parts following the incident. An FIR has been lodged in this connection with the police.

Woman killed: A woman was killed when an unidentified vehicle hit her in an area under the Sachivalaya police station on Monday. She has been identified as Asha, a resident of Rajendra Nagar area. Investigation is on, the police said.

Kidnapper held: Notorious kidnapper Murari Singh was arrested by the police from his native village Badpur under the Maranchi police station on Tuesday morning. Police have recovered one 9 mm pistol and at least a dozen live cartridges from his possession.

Murari was wanted by the police in a number of kidnapping and bank loot cases. He was also wanted by the police in the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Baidyanath Ayurveda Bhavan companyâ€™s vice president Anil Gautam and his driver in November last year.

Sources said Murari has confessed his involvement in a number of cases including kidnapping of a Giridih-based trader Rajgarhiya and another Devbrata Dutta, Afro Braveries Limited companyâ€™s incharge of Bihar and Jharkhand. â€œHe could not get ransom amount from both the persons because of their safe recovery by the police,â€� said a senior police officer quoting Murari as saying.

Singh was also involved in the loot of about Rs 3.5 lakh from the Giridih-based Punjab National Bank last year. â€œHe had received cash about Rs 50,000 as his share,â€� informed the police officer.

Earlier, four members of Murari gang were caught by local people while committing a bank dacoity in Deoghar this year.

Murari is learnt to have denied his involvement in this crime.

Till late evening on Tuesday, he was being interrogated by a special police team.

11,Stamp duty cut may increase revenue,"BANGALORE: The state government hopes to mop up over Rs 600 crore through property registration this year, despite a slash in stamp duty and registration fee, on account of the rationalisation measures.

In the current budget, the stamp duty was brought down by 2 per cent and registration fee by one per cent. Besides, the stamp duty has been rationalised across the board for apartments in addition to scrapping additional stamp duty (hitherto levied at 2 per cent of market value of property) and replacing it with a surcharge, which will henceforth be pegged at 2 and 3 per cent of stamp duty.

Like other taxes, Karnataka has one of the highest stamp duties and registration fee. The decision to slash both will not only encourage registration, but is also in keeping with the Planning Commissionâ€™s brief to peg stamp duty across the country at five per cent by 2007.

â€œNormally, such measures are expected to lead to a drop in the collections. However, the measures were brought about as thousands of properties, especially in Bangalore, have not been registered due to the high rate of duties. Owners have contented themselves with a general power of attorney. We expect that these properties will now get registered. In fact, registrations and revenue collections will dramatically pick up due to these measures,â€� stamps and registration department sources said.

To indicate the growth in collections, the department finished the last fiscal with an impressive growth of over 36 per cent by collecting Rs 1,026 crore. This year, the department hopes to mop up Rs 1,354 crore.

There is also another additional reason for the government to resort to these measures.

â€œIn Bangalore alone, the housing sector accounts for a whopping Rs 700 crore investment each year. With the state government committed to boosting this sector, it was but natural to put these rationalisation measures in place,â€� sources stated.

12,"FM companies face losses, seek govt help","NEW DELHI: Several FM radio companies on Wednesday lamented that they were facing severe losses and asked the government to switch over to the revenue-sharing regime.

However, the government is understood to be disinclined to agree to this demand saying it was a policy decision under which the companies had bid for licenses.

Representatives from six FM players met Information and Broadcasting Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and expressed their woes about the business, sources said.

They said the companies, some of which have been running FM radio for over a year, were suffering financial losses and demanded that government change to the revenue-sharing regime from the present license fee.

The FM players whose representatives met the Minister on Wednesday included those floated by India Today, Times of India and Star.

The open auction for selecting licensees was held first in March, 2000, on the basis of which 29 companies were selected for allocation of 101 channels in 40 city centres. The government had introduced a ten-year licence term with 15 per cent increase every year.

Radio broadcasting saw a revolution last year with private FM launching services in several cities including Mumbai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Indore while more cities are expected to tune in to it very soon.

14,Suspended DDA official arrested,"NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday arrested a suspended Delhi Development Authority official who was reportedly involved in the recent land deal scam.

According to CBI sources, the accused Ashok Kapoor was a conduit between DDA officials and an education society in fixing a land deal.

Kapoor, who was sent to CBIâ€™s custody for five days, was secretary to a former vice-chairman of DDA and was suspended two years ago from the service after Rs 8.80 lakh were recovered from his locker. He, however, continued to work as a middleman for some DDA officials, CBI has alleged.

According to the second FIR, Kapoor was involved in striking a land deal for a private school. The FIR also named former DDA director Subhash Sharma, Jagdish Chander, director (lands), the conduit Dharambir S Khattar and Amritlal Kapoor, director of Modern Public School Education Society.

These officials allegedly showed undue favour to the society after DDA had cancelled the societyâ€™s lease of four acres of land that was lying unutilised in Shalimar Bagh. The society runs a school on the adjoining plot.

Kapoor reportedly contacted Khattar. The school director was asked to pay a bribe of Rs 3 lakh. This amount was to be allegedly shared by DDA vice-chairman, Chander, Khattar and Kapoor.
