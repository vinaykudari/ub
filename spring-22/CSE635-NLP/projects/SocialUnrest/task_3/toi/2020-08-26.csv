2,BJP heeds CM’s no-bandh call,"MUMBAI\AURANGABAD: The BJP leadership appears to be divided on its response to the twin blasts that shook Mumbai on Monday.

While BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan was prompt in demanding that the Democratic Front government be dismissed and that Presidentâ€™s rule be imposed in the state, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani seemed to take a different line.

Mr Advani told journalists on Tuesday at the scene of the first blast at Zaveri Bazar that the Centre and state needed to work closely to nab the terrorists.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi expressed a similar view. Both Mr Advani and Ms Gandhi flew into the city from Delhi on Tuesday and visited the blast sites at the Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazar.

Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde and deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal briefed them. Speaking to journalists at Zaveri Bazar,Mr Advani noted that Pakistan had condemned Mondayâ€™s blasts. But, he added, he wanted Pakistan to follow up its statement with concrete action.

He said India had already submitted a list of 20 persons who were wanted in connection with the Mumbai serial blasts of March 1993. Of these, one person was detained by the UAE government when he visited Dubai. â€œBut the remaining 19 persons are still being sheltered in Pakistan,â€™â€™Mr Advani said.

Speaking to journalists at Zaveri Bazar, Shiv Sena leader Narayan Rane demanded that Presidentâ€™s rule be imposed in Maharashtra. In Aurangabad, BJP leader Gopinath Munde claimed that â€œthe failure of the law and order machinery to eliminate organised crime was the main reason why terrorists were operating so freely in Maharashtraâ€™â€™.

He announced that the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance would take out a silent protest march from the Gateway of India to Mantralaya at 10 a.m. on Wednesday. This would be followed by a day-long dharna at Hutatma Chowk on Thursday.

He said Mr Shinde had urged the alliance not to call for a bandh in view of the grave situation.

3,Minister rules out easing CRZ restrictions,"MUMBAI: In a major setback to the buildersâ€™ lobby, Union minister for environment and forests T.R. Baalu on Monday said that the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules would not be eased for Mumbai.

The minister also announced that sanction had been given for several long-standing infrastructural projects in the state.

The state government recently has been lobbying to get the CRZ rules relaxed because they restrict development along the coastline and obstruct infrastructural and housing development.

This is especially true for salt-pan lands in the eastern suburbs.The CRZ restrictions have reportedly hampered progress on the major building projects of some private developers.

Mr Baalu said there was no question of relaxing the rules and opening up the salt-pan lands.

4,Doctor shot at by lawyer,"NEW DELHI: A doctor was allegedly fired at, and threatened by a lawyer and his associates in the Model Town area on Monday night.

The accused, S S Tyagi, an advocate practising at the Tis Hazari courts, is absconding. Dr C M Arora, was reportedly threatened for showing ""reluctance"" in visiting Tyagi''s house to check his wife.

A call was received by the PCR at about 9 pm on Monday with the caller claiming that her husband and nephew had just escaped an attempt on their lives.

Arora runs a private hospital in Mahender Enclave near GT Karnal road. The accused had reportedly approached him on Janmashtami day, asking the doctor to come to his residence as his wife was not feeling well. Arora reportedly asked Tyagi to bring the lady to the hospital as he couldn''t make a house visit.

""I first told Tyagi that a home visit was not possible, but then agreed to come as he kept on insisting. The lady had typical viral symptoms for which I prescribed medication,"" said Arora.

The doctor claimed that Tyagi never contacted him after the visit, but he barged into his office all of a sudden on Monday.

""The lawyer and his associate entered my room in a heavily drunk state and began to abuse me. Tyagi''s associate took out a revolver and said he would shoot me as I did not agree to go to his friend''s residence immediately,"" claimed Arora.

The doctor''s nephew, Jaideep came inside the office on hearing the commotion. Arora claimed that when Jaideep tried to intervene, the accused fired the gun at him. The bullet apparently hit a table, missing Jaideep by inches.

5,Rlys net record ticket sale on rally day,"LUCKNOW: Phenomenal rise in the sale of railway tickets on the day of the Bahujan Samaj Partyâ€™s workers conference has outdone any previous record during any political assembly in the state in recent years.

KM Tripathi, senior divisional commercial manager (NR), claimed that total tickets sold on Sunday were over 29,000 worth more than Rs 12 lakh â€œthough Sunday always does a lean businessâ€�, as against a daily average sale of 22,000 or Rs 7-8 lakh from passengers.

Moreover, the fact that all the ministers arriving in the city to attend the rally reportedly had to buy platform ticket to get entrance is incredible on the part of railway authorities and lends them a word of praise.

Though some BSP workers allegedly tried to escape from paying fares by using unauthentic rail passes, but they could not outsmart vigilant railway officials.

About additional booking counters put up considering the expected rush and the mishap during one of the previous BSP rallies which killed 20 people, the senior DCM said that 20 extra booking counters had been established in order to prevent any kind of mob and chaos once heavy inflow of party workers was noticed.

7,Police role in riots gets mixed response from Shahibaug,"AHMEDABAD: A witness of the riots last year told the inquiry commission on Tuesday that if the police had opened fire on time to disperse the mob, the extent of damage at the posh Moti Manor Hotel in Shahibaug on February 28, 2002, would have been much less.

Deposing before the Nanavati-Shah commission here on Tuesday, Pradyuman Bhatt, a resident of Sterling Apartment near Shahibaug underbridge, said the mob which had gathered to attack the hotel, was dispersed only after the police opened fire on them. But he said the drastic action was taken by the police only when the irate mob had set the hotel on fire.

He further added that the limited number of policemen were ineffective before the huge crowd. Later when more armed forces arrived in the afternoon and fired on the mob which was on rampage, the situation was brought under control.

About 12 persons from Shahibaug and parts of Naroda under Sardarnagar police station, deposed before the commission. Though many of the people lauded the efforts of the police who saved them and their properties, some said the cops did could not reach on time.

Sabir Hussain Ansari, a resident of Shahibaug near Bhilvas, said â€œinspector NN Pathan and his team reached there on time.â€� Anwar Mirza, a priest at Hazrat Ladlapir na dargah at Shahibaug, said â€œwhen a mob had come on February 28 I locked myself in the â€˜dargahâ€™. I heard sounds of firing after some time when I realised that police had arrived.â€� Mirza added â€œthe police rescued me, they also took care of our properties and belonging.â€�

Another priest, Sayyad Mohammad Hussain, of Razia Pir-ni-Dargah at Sardarnagar, said â€œsituation was bad, but my Hindu neighbours gave me refuge and also assured me that I will be safe.â€�

Some of the residents of Naroda also deposed before the commission that their properties were destroyed by the members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. They however pleaded before the commission for inadequate compensation.

Kamrunissa Sayyed, a resident of Naroda, told the commission that the government only gave her Rs 4,500 though her losses were almost to the tune Rs 1 lakh. â€œI am a widow with two nubile daughtersâ€� she lamented adding â€œwith everything gone, life has become very difficult for me.â€�

Mohammad Shafi Sheikh of Madhusudan Rolling Mills complained that some VHP men came in a Maruti and burnt down his meat shop and house. â€œWhen I came back from a relief camp nothing was there and even my 16 goats were missing,â€� he said adding, â€œAs compensation I got just Rs 3,500.â€�

Similar pleas were made by Nasir Sheikh of Janta Nagar who lost his property and about 43 goats and Rukshana Bano of Naroda, who said their compensation packages were just a small fraction of their losses. Bano claims her losses to be to the tune of Rs 4.5 lakh.

The commission however directed authorities of the collectorate to take a fresh look into their matter and appropriately compensate them in case there has been any error in calculating relief packages.

Tight security for hearings

AHMEDABAD: In wake of the crucial third phase of public hearing when the Nanavati-Shah commission would be hearing depositions of sensitive Meghaninagar and Naroda-Patia areas from Wednesday, security has been tightened at the venue of the hearings in Shahibaug.

Armed guards have been posted at the main gate of the compound and just outside the chamber where the hearing is held . Also a team of 14 policewomen have been deployed. â€œThe deployments have been effected just in order to avoid any untoward incident while the hearing is on,â€� said an official in charge of the bandobast.

8,Governor should invite Mulayam to form govt,"LUCKNOW: Rashtriya Kranti Party president Kalyan Singh feels that the governor should invite Mulayam Singh Yadav to form the government and ask him to prove his majority on the floor of the vidhan sabha. â€œWe do not want Presidentâ€™s rule and impose fresh polls on the people when the assembly had not completed its term.â€�

Talking to reporters, the RKP president said Mulayam was the leader of the front comprising the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, the Congress and his outfit. He said chances for Mulayam heading the government were bright. None of the MLAs, he said, wanted to face mid-term polls. Singh said that Mayawati had duped the BJP twice in the past but they believed that this time no such thing would happen. The statement made by BJP president Venkaiah Naidu showed that the party had no understanding of ground reality, said the RKP president.

Casting aspersion on the prime minister, he said for the sake of prime ministership, Vajpayee was handing over one after another state to non-BJP parties. Likewise, he had given free hand to railway minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar, Bal Thakre in Maharashtra, Naveen Patnaik in Orissa and, till now, Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh. In all these states, he said, popularity of the BJP was going down but the prime minister was unconcerned about it, said Singh, adding Vajpayeeâ€™s worry was to retain prime ministership at all costs.

Singh said that Mayawatiâ€™s politics had alienated Jatavs in Uttar Pradesh. He said many Jatav-dominated villages saw non-Jatavs joining hands against dalits and this had happened due to the BSPâ€™s partisan politics.

This polarisation of castes against Jatavs would adversely affect the prospects of Mayawati and her allies, said Singh. Asked whether he would like to join the government headed by Mulayam, Singh said â€œNoâ€�. Singh, however, said that he would not mind his men joining the ministry but any decision in this regard would be taken later.

9,"CPI(ML) sees link between riots, blasts","PATNA: Monday''s bomb blasts in Mumbai cannot be seen in isolation from the Gujarat riots, said general secretary of the CPI (ML) Dipankar Bhattacharya.

""The Mumbai blasts of 1993 had links with the demolition of Babri mosque at Ayodhya. And this incident must be likened to what happened in Gujarat riots and its aftermath,"" Bhattacharya remarked while addressing a press conference in Patna on Tuesday. While criticising the Mumbai blasts, he maintained, ""those who escaped becoming victimised in the Gujarat riots, are now not only suppressed but also denied justice"". According to him, the Mumbai blasts have exposed the failure of BJP, particularly home minister L K Advani to fight terrorism.

Speaking on the political developments in UP, he said BJP and BSP had broken their alliance in the past. ""The marriage of convenience between them ended in the past. But a cat has nine lives,"" he told mediapersons. He said the end of alliance between the two parties is good for the political health of the country. ""The alliance was based completely on opportunism,"" he asserted. While referring to the Taj corridor controversy, he said there is also a link between ""Ayodhya"" (read Babri demolition case) and Agra. Reacting to the ASI report, he said, ""ASI should be renamed as an ''abysmal shame'' of India. BJP is accommodating its men in all such institutions which are academic and professional,"" he said.

He appealed all the Left and democratic parties to be ready to give a befitting reply to the BJP in the coming Lok Sabha elections. ""BJP''s end will come in this election with issues like Ayodhya, uniform civil code and cow slaughters,"" he maintained. Criticising the state government, he said it has dual character. Our workers are facing charges of sedition for showing black flags to L K Advani, an accused in the Babri case.

10,SC cancels RJD MLA's election,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has set aside election of RJD candidate Dinesh Chaudhury from Fatua reserved assembly constituency in Bihar in 2000 noticing â€œmanipulationâ€� in the scheduled caste certificate provided by him and directed the Election Commission to hold fresh elections.

Chaudhury had defeated Janata Dal(U) candidate Punit Rai by a margin of nearly 7,000 votes.

Chaudhury had secured 46,850 votes while Rai had secured 39,897 votes.

The Patna High Court had upheld the election of Chaudhury and rejected Raiâ€™s petition challenging the election on the ground that the RJD MLA had provided a â€œfakeâ€� scheduled caste certificate to contest from the reserve constituency.

Setting aside the high court order, a bench comprising Chief Justice V N Khare, Justice Brijesh Kumar and Justice S B Sinha directed the â€œElection Commission of India to hold election for filling up the vacancy caused by setting aside of the election of Chaudhury.â€�

The bench noted the returning officer had grave doubt about the veracity of the caste certificate to the extent that she had lodged an FIR against Chaudhury.

â€œIn support of the suspicion entertained about the caste certificate being fabricated, she had a report from the district welfare officer, Gaya. A criminal case was registered and Chaudhury was arrested,â€� the bench noted.

On acceptance of the nomination form, the bench said: â€œIt is surprising that despite such a grave suspicion and initiation of criminal proceedings against the candidate, the returning officer still accepted his nomination papers.â€�

The court said that the returning officer had stated on February 1, 2000, after she had lodged the report, that there was a lot of opposition in respect of the nomination paper of Chaudhury.

12,BJP MLA incited mob: Naroda victim,"AHMEDABAD: A Muslim resident of Naroda Gam named local BJP MLA Mayaben Kodnani as the person who instigated the mob on February 28 last year to go on rampage in the area even as a Hindu witness said the violence was sparked off after a Hindu boy was stabbed to death near the Bank of India building in Naroda.

Such allegations and counter-allegations were heard by the riot inquiry commission headed by Justice Nanavati and Justice Shah during the crucial session of complaints from areas under the Naroda police station in Ahmedabad.

Nearly 43 persons had been heard by the commission till about 1 pm.

Nanumiyan Malik (50), a resident of Naroda Gam, where eight persons were killed in riots, said things were quiet till 9.30 am on February 28 last year when Kodnani, the local BJP MLA from Naroda addressed a public meeting at the market place, a day after the massacre of 59 Ram Sevaks aboard the Sabarmati Express in Godhra. It was after the meeting that the mob went on a rampage.

Malik said that while fleeing from the scene, he saw at least three persons being set on fire by the mob, which even tried to enter the police station.

He added that only two policemen were present at the police station and even though they tried to resist the mob, the people entered the police station.

The mob also went inside the panchayat building and collected diesel from there which was used to set houses of Muslims on fire. Malik said that a police team arrived to escort them to the Shah-e-Alam relief camp only at 11 am.

However, Mafatlal Patel, also a resident of Naroda Gam, said that the mob got agitated by the killing of a Hindu boy, who was attacked with swords on the road near Bank of India branch.

A group of Hindu women, who had gathered at the Circuit House annexe where the hearings were being held, raised slogans that they, too, be allowed to depose before the commission.

The venue of the hearings, which are normally held at the commission''s office in Shahibaug, were moved to nearby Circuit House as a large number of victims were expected from the area, which witnessed some of the worst violence last year, including the infamous Naroda Patia massacre in which nearly 85 persons were killed.

The hearings started in an orderly fashion at around 10.30 am as Justice Nanavati and Justice Shah started hearing to the depositions of victims from Naroda Patia and adjoining areas.

Metal detectors were pressed into service and heavy security arrangements were in evidence at the venue in view of the sensitivity of the cases being heard on Wednesday.

The Naroda victims alleged that they had been receiving threats from local anti-social elements not to depose before the commission. On Tuesday, Salim Shaikh, an autorickshaw driver residing at Naroda-Patia, whose wife, daughter and another family member were killed during the riots, was threatened when he was waiting near the V S Hospital.

""Salim rushed back to the Naroda police station and informed the police about the incident. At least four to five such threats have come our way. I think the idea is to keep the riot-victims suppressed and frightened,"" said Siddiquebhai Mansuri, a member of the Kamdar Swastha Suraksha Mandal (KSSM).

Even on Wednesday, victims alleged that the atmosphere inside the Circuit House was ""intimidating"" because of the presence of a large number of activists from Naroda who were asking the victims why they had come for the depositions.

Wahid Qureishi, a resident of Naroda Patia, said ""some people at the entrance of the building were asking some funny questions, they even asked me whether I have come year to get a medal for the riots"".

13,"Blasts, protest mar PM's visit to Kashmir","SRINAGAR: Two powerful blasts rocked Srinagar and Baramulla on Wednesday morning even as Prime Minister Vajpayee arrived here to inaugurate the crucial two-day inter-state council meeting.

At least three persons were injured in the blasts, the police said, adding security had been tightened around Srinagar city.

Meanwhile, normal life was affected in the city due to a general strike. All public transport and government offices remained closed for the day. The strike call was given by various militant groups, including the Hurriyat Conference and Syed Ali Shah Geelani, against the Prime Minister''s visit.

Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani are expected to arrive here in the afternoon.

Official sources said that Indian Air Force''s help was sought in the wake of militants'' threat to use explosive-laden toy planes to create destruction.

15,BJP demands CBI probe into Marad violence,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala unit of the BJP on Wednesday asserted that the UDF government should order a CBI probe into May 2 Marad violence that claimed nine lives, to bring back normalcy in the area and facilitate rehabilitation of minority families that fled the area after the violence.

Addressing a press conference here, State unit President P Sreedharan Pillai said aggrieved Arya community in the area wanted an inquiry by an independent agency like CBI and ""it is their only just demand to solve the present stalemate on the issue"".

Pillai said the demand for a CBI probe into Marad violence has been vindicated by the Thalasserry Additional Court observation on Wednesday in the BJP leader K T Jayakrishnan murder case, which said the state police tried to scuttle the investigation to help the accused CPI-M activists.

In the present circumstances Chief Minister A K Antony should order a CBI probe into the incident to solve the Marad issue, he said.

He said Antony has called BJP leaders for a meeting, which would be held next week.

Referring to the September 23 by-election in Ernakulam Parliament constituency, Pillai said a five-member committee of senior leaders including Union Minister of State for Defence, O Rajagopal has been set up to finalise strategies and the candidate for the election. It was not decided yet whether BJP should field a candidate of its own or support an independent candidate, he said.

Marad issue, Antony''s observation that minorities get undue advantage from government and Vajpayee government''s achievements would be main plank of the campaign.

16,There's more than meets the eye on Chinese incursion report,"NEW DELHI: There is a sense of deja vu in reports of a Chinese incursion into Indian territory in Arunachal Pradesh. In 1986, similar reports about the Chinese occupation of Sumdorong Chu (chu=river) touched off a major crisis that brought India and China close to war.

Then, as now, the incident involved Intelligence Bureau personnel, rather than the Army which routinely patrols the frontier in that region. It is also likely that then, as now, the incident was a result of the fact that Indian intelligence agencies have their own interpretation of the LAC, different from that of the Chinese and the Army.

This puts the McMahon Line in some areas somewhat north of where it would be, if the Treaty of Simla of 1914 that created it were to be literally interpreted.

The Chinese have never recognised this treaty which was initialled, though not signed, by its representative. But though they have broadly respected this boundary since 1962, the Chinese refuse to recognise the McMahon Line and claim a boundary along a line that runs on the foothills of the mountains incorporating Arunachal Pradesh.

Besides this basic dispute, it is well known that the map attached to the treaty was of such a scale that a literal translation of the coordinates map on the ground would still leave a band some four-seven km wide that could be interpreted in different ways, causing confusion as to where the border lay.

The problem has really arisen from the IB''s interpretation of the map. Since the 1950s, it has insisted that the border was not the literal McMahon Line as translated on the ground, but the highest crest-line of the Himalayas in the region. The problem is that in this region, north-south streams and rivers have ensured that the highest crest-line is not as distinct as it is in the other parts of the Himalayas.

In 1962, the Army insisted that its maps showed this to be the Hathung La (La=pass) ridge, while the IB insisted it was the Thag La across the Namka Chu. The Army was ordered to clear the Chinese off the Thang La ridge, resulting in war and humiliating defeat for India.

In 1985, on the basis of a 1983 directive to actively patrol the border, an IB party began camping on a nearby pasturage on the Sumdorong Chu. But when they returned in 1986, they found the Chinese camped. A story leaked to the press alleging a Chinese incursion touched off a crisis that nearly led to war.

Given this background, there seems to be something more to the recent incident than meets the eye. There have been reports in the recent past of Chinese road construction in the Asaphi La region. It is more than likely that the Indian group was on a reconnaissance mission and deep inside the Chinese side of the LAC rather than in Indian territory as claimed subsequently.
