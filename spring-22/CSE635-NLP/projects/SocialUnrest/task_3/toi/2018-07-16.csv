""the quarterly budget for the purchase of medicine is rs 36 lakh and with such meagre amounts it is not possible to procure sufficient antibiotics and other medicine,"" p n vasantha, pharmacy supervisor of gandhi hospital said. it is not just the costly medicine alone, many government hospitals even do not possess the required quantity of syringes and cotton, forcing the patients to purchase at private stores at premium rates. for instance, a syringe of 2 ml capacity with the maximum retail price (mrp) of rs 3.90 is sold at rs 5 at medical stores in and around the gandhi hospital. similarly a disposable syringe of 5 ml capacity with mrp of rs 4.50 is sold at rs 7 near another government hospital. ""everyday, my doctor asks me to buy 12 disposable syringes but uses only two,"" syed aleem, a resident of koti, said. aleem's wife was admitted to the government maternity hospital, nayapul, on july 5 for delivery. aleem has spent more than rs 400 a day on syringes, cotton and medicine but does not know why doctors want him to bring a dozen syringes a day. however, a doctor working at the osmania hospital said on condition of anonymity that the syringes and glucose bottles bought by the patients are returned to the respective medical stores by doctors and other staff and they get a cut in the deal. but the patients' plight is not limited to syringes and cotton. some doctors prefer prescribing expensive antibiotics without verifying the financial well-being of the patients. agreeing that physicians are prescribing expensive drugs to patients, a doctor working with the gandhi hospital justified the action. gandhi hospital superintendent a krishanveni admitted that the malpractices were indeed going on in government hospitals. she said it was not possible for any government hospital to cater to the needs of all the patients.

10,RTC to increase night services,"hyderabad: keeping in view the increasing demands from customers, the andhra pradesh state road transport corporation (apsrtc) has proposed to ply 10 more buses on late night routes shortly. the apsrtc is receiving requests from commuters to operate more services during the late night hours. according to apsrtc regional manager ch rameswara rao, the number of people travelling late in the night has increased considerably over the years. due to the expansion of the city and increase in the activities of the corporate sector, night life is extended beyond the midnight, which is one of the reasons why the rtc planning to increase the night services. though the rtc is running night services, they are mostly confined to main routes. for example, no bus goes beyond uppal and mehdipatnam after 12 at night.

""so, the addition of buses is proposed to give more choice to the consumer than to make profits,"" rameswara rao said. however, to make the services viable, the corporation has plans of increasing the ticket fare of late night buses at least by half. ""this is now only at a conceptual level, but we might try it out in a couple of months,"" he said. as of now, late night buses in the city run chiefly on main corridors of the city. these include route no 1 (secunderabad-afzalgunj); no 2 (secunderabad-charminar via shankarmutt, kachiguda); no 5 (secunderabad- mehadipatnam); no 7 (secunderbad-charminar, via tank bund and abids) and no 10 (secunderbad-uppal). the new buses of too will ply on main roads. at charminar however, the rtc has introduced 4 short-distance buses which will run only in the old city. this type of service may be extended to the suburbs for late night travel, rameswara rao said.

17,Prema has no more political ambitions,"bangalore: mayor prema cariappa never made it to honolulu because chief minister s.m.krishna didn't think it a good idea given the sad state of bangalore during the anrchy unleashed by the ofc brigade. her intemperate fulminations against bda commissioner jayakar jerome haven't improved her image one bit. nevertheless, she caims she is sincere and has the city's well-being always on her mind. s kushala puts the mayor on the rack. what have been your major tasks after you took over as the mayor of bangalore city? i opened the richmond circle flyover. we are planning to take up a couple of projects. we will open the underpass at mekhri circle, pedestrian subway at sangam theatre. we will lay foundation stone to commence the work of road over and under bridges this month. the negotiations are on for the small flyovers that are being proposed at traffic intersections. for the first time in the history of karnataka, we have signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government. i feel it has lessened the burden of the bcc. you have been in the eye of controversy for visiting the areas where the bangalore development authority (bda) carried out the demolition of the illegal structures. you had promised to take a delegation to the cm and request him to give compensation to the affected families. it was a mistake what people have quoted me in the paper. i never said i will give the compensation. i am nobody to do that. when the people represented their cases, i told them that i will speak to the chief minister and request him for the compensation. i dont know how it was misunderstood that i will give the compensation. it is not possible. the bda has done its duty and iam not the person to recommend for the unauthorised constructions - either temple, commercial complex, mosque or a church. when i came back from germany, i told in the press conference that in germany when the mad cow disease broke out, the cows were killed but not one paise compensation was given to anyone. when the 200 residents and the area corporators came to me with a request to visit the area, i visited the area on humanitarian grounds. you also allowed the council to pass the resolution regarding this? dont you have a say in it? i did not pass any resolution. i am just a presiding officer in the council. it is the council which brings the resolution. when 100 corporators have agreed, i do not have a say. the resolution is sent to the government which takes the decision whether to approve or reject it. why dont you avoid getting into unnecessary controversies? i don't think i have been in any controversy except this. even, this incident, i dont know how it happened. when the people posed their problems, i told them that i will represent their case to the government. apart from the bda controversy, there were also allegations that you were instrumental in bringing pressure on the government to transfer the former bcc commissioner shantanu consul. you were said to be backed by other corporators in creating trouble for the commissioner. i was not. it is an issue pertaining to the government. the decision to transfer him was taken at the government level. there was no misunderstanding between me and consul. even after he left the bcc, i was in touch with him. i never had any problems with any officers in the bcc over the last 10 years that i have been in the bcc. the root cause of the problem between the corporators and consul was that the corporators wanted the tailoring teachers to be paid. but consul, was right in telling that they were not appointed directly by the bcc and since they had not been working regularly, they would not be paid. he was right. but the corporators contended that the tailoring teachers had worked, the officials had taken their attendance. the corporators wanted the tailoring centres to be closed if the bcc could not pay the salaries of the teachers. so this tiff went on for two to three months. what has been your contribution to your ward after you became the mayor? a small portion of my ward did not have water and underground drainage facilities. so i got the work sanctioned for rs 85 lakh to provide drinking water and ugd. all the old pipes which had corroded has been replaced. is a one year mayoral term sufficient for the mayor? i don't want to comment on the mayoral term. but, i think the mayor should be directly elected by the people. such a system is being followed in other cities. you have all along maintained that you will not contest in the coming elections. why? i have held every big post in the bcc for the last 10 years - be it mayor, deputy mayor, party leader or chairperson of the standing committees. usually corporators who become mayors do not contest for elections. even if the party high command asks me to contest, i will say sorry. i just want to relax now and spend my time with my family.

""the farmers once reluctant to use the green houses have on their own approached and asked us to help in cultivation he added. citing an instance, the vice-chancellor said one farmer who in the first phase mocked at the plan faced tough time and adopted scientific method of harnessing the greenhouse method evolved by the university. ""now we have started growing spinach, coriander, chillies, tomatoes."" replying to query mehta said cultivation of any sort in the green house is more scientific and earns greater profit. with nominal irrigation one can harvest much greater products. during my visit to kutch last month, several villagers opposed our suggestion to grow the vegetation in the green houses because they were totally alien to the new technique of cultivation. one among the dozen using the green house for dwelling purpose so far termed the new technology as snobbish and a mere publicity. rejecting the advice he reacted bitterly: we do not use spinach; it is worth fodder only. persuasive by nature, dr mehta however replied, you and your wife though look hearty and healthy yet you might have iron deficiency. on the next visit, added mehta, he found he had abundance of spinach grown in the green house. he was all appreciation for the spinach which he had made apart of the food habit, the vice chancellor said with a smile of satisfaction. people, however, illiterate or ignorant can be brought on the right track, through proper persuasion and guidance.
