0,Joshi demands postponing rural polls,"KOLKATA: Senior BJP leader and Union human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi demanded in Kolkata on Monday that panchayat elections in West Bengal, slated for May 11, be postponed in view of reports that CPM activists were preventing Opposition candidates from filing nominations.

Joshi also sought immediate intervention of the National Human Rights Commission and said that NHRC should suggest measures so that people could exercise their democratic rights of contesting and voting in the polls. ""Till a conducive atmosphere is created for a free and fair poll, the elections should be postponed,"" Joshi said.

While the Trinamul Congress demanded that the polls be postponed by four days since only a single day remained for filing of nominations, the CPM turned down all demands for postponement saying such demands were aimed at disrupting the elections by parties which knew that they would lose the polls. ""If people refuse to contest as Opposition candidates, what can we do ,"" said CPM state secretary Anil Biswas.

During the day, Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee met Joshi to discuss the panchayat poll issue. BJP leaders Tathagata Roy and Tapan Sikdar, heading two warring groups of the party, were also present. Interestingly, the memorandum that Banerjee submitted to Joshi did not include the demand for imposition of Presidentâ€™s rule in the state.

2,Porn films rule suburban parlours,"KOLKATA: Cinema halls in at least seven blocks and police stations areas of South 24 Parganas may soon be forced to down shutters for good.

The reason: mushrooming video parlours which screen blue films all through the day, sometimes showing films which have even been shot in nearby homes.

The popularity of these makeshift halls where the films are shown on large projectors, have reached such a level that even teenagers and students are thronging to these parlours. They are able to satisfy themselves at low cost. ""We have informed the local police but they seem to be working hand-in-glove with these hall owners,"" said a local SUCI leader.

Some of these â€˜showsâ€™ are being shown in broad daylight, alleged some parents. They said the films were most popular in small halls in areas like Mathurapur, Bapulibazar, Kulpi, Raidhigi, Charan, Kakdwip and Tulsighata.

They further alleged that some local cable-operators were even screening these films on cable channels. This allegation was corroborated by BJP activist Subhasish Dey, who said employees of these video parlours were charging a premium for allowing teenage students into these parlours.

""These unauthorised parlours are responsible for the present plight of cinema halls here as they screen pornography in broad daylight without any check on the age of viewers. This has also led to a huge rise in anti-social activities in the area,"" Jayanta Dutta, a local cinema hall owner.

Speaking to TNN district superintendent of police Deb Kumar Ganguly admitted that the problem persisits in some areas. ""We normally conduct raids on the basis of concrete evidence. We have already done so in some cases,"" he said.

3,Colleague suicide foxes police,"KOLKATA: Subedar B.K. Majumdar should have been a happy man. His only daughter was getting married on April 26 and his superior had granted him leave to go home to celebrate the event.

Yet on Sunday night the 52-yearold sub-inspector with the Third Battalion of Kolkata Police, shot himself in the head while sitting inside a police vehicle. He was rushed to SSKM when on Monday, he succumbed to his injuries.

As the Majumdar family grappled to come to terms with the tragedy, the investigating officers or his colleagues failed to provide any clues as to who or what could have led Majumdar to end his life. Witnesses say that Majumdar shot himself with his service revolver while on duty in a High Radio Flying Squad vehicle parked at the Khidderpore crossing.

DC (port) Hermanpreet Singh said, a suicide note was found in his pocket. In the note, Majumdar wrote, ""For the last 15 ..... I am being blackmailed. There is no point in living anymore. So, I am leaving."" The omission of the length of time, 15 weeks or months, deepens the mystery. His colleagues too said they were baffled.

""We were chatting and some of us were standing just outside the vehicle when suddenly a loud shot rang out. The next thing we knew, Majumdar lying in a pool of blood,"" a colleague said.

DC (third battalion) O.P. Gupta said, Majumdarâ€™s daughter was due to get married on April 26. ""He had been granted leave from Tuesday. see no reason for him to commit suicide,â€� he said. Majumdarâ€™s young son too could offer no explanation. Even Majumdarâ€™s brother Dilip said he had no idea about his brother being blackmailed or threatened, as mentioned in the suicide note. â€œHe never told us anything. I still cannot believe he could commit suicide,"" a dazed Dilip said.

The officerâ€™s body has been taken away to his home in Nabadwip for cremation.

4,Mulayam Singh dares Maya to arrest him,"GORAYA, Jalandhar: In reply to the 29 cases pertaining to alleged misuse of chief ministerâ€™s discretionary fund while he was in power registered against him, Mulayam Singh Yadav, president of Samajwadi Party, on Monday dared Mayawati to arrest him and termed the allegations as baseless.

â€˜â€˜All the cases registered against me are baseless and based on the political vendetta as the comptroller and auditor general, high court and assembly have already given clean chit to the decisions,â€™â€™ Yadav told reporters at Goraya, about 50 km from here.

â€˜â€˜When the allegations for use of discretionary funds were cleared in assembly, even Mayawati was also present in the assembly,â€™â€™ he said, adding that the cases registered against him were just to take revenge for exposing her by releasing two CDs released by his party showing her asking her party MPs and MLAs to donate a part of their sansad and vidhayak nidhi to the BSP coffers and also over some remarks about Hindu deities.

In reply to the allegations of Mayawati that Mulayam also used the MPs and MLAâ€™s fund for the schools controlled by him and his family, Singh said that what stopped her from coming out with the allegations at the time when it happened. Coming out with the allegation after so many years shows that the allegations were levelled just to settle political scores.

â€˜â€˜We had not succumbed to the pressure of even Indira Gandhi during emergency and we will not bend down before Mayawati also,â€™â€™ Mulayam said, adding that he is ready to go to jail if he has committed anything wrong. Reacting to allegations of Mayawati that the tapes released against her were doctored, Mulayam challenged her to get it probed from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and if the tapes found doctored, he would resign from politics.

5,Contract teachers at govt schools to go by May-end,"CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has decided to depute regular teachers and do away with the services of contract teachers at government schools by May-end.

The education department will conduct a string of interviews from April 22 to sign up over 300 regular teachers to fill vacant posts in schools, currently occupied by contract teachers.

The teachers were recruited last year as temporary solution to the scarcity of staff in government schools. The tenure of the contract teachers would have expired on March 31, 2003, had the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) not made it binding on the administration to replace contract appointments only with regular teachers and not contract teachers.

DPI (schools) DS Mangat told Times News Network that regular teachers would be appointed and posted to schools where vacancies exist, by May 31.

The education department wants to complete the selection and appointment process on time so that new teachers can get acclimatised to the workplace in the beginning of the session itself.

Delay in making fresh appointments will not be in the best interest of students who will continue to depend on contract teachers with â€œlower experience levels.â€�

District education officer Rajesh Chaudhary said, â€œAcademic standards at government schools will improve with the appointment of regular teachers. Most applicants for regular posts are highly qualified and possess vast teaching experience.â€�

The schools authorities feel contract teachers lack motivational skills and their commitment levels are low, which works against studentsâ€™ interest.

6,"Tragedy dogs BSP rally, leaves 5 dead","LUCKNOW: When the last of the rallyists walked out of Ambedkar Maidan at 5:30 pm on Monday, senior police officals heaved a sigh of relief. Allâ€™s well that ends well. They may have thought. But the weather Gods had other ideas. A thunderstorm took everyone by surprise. It was welcome relief to the heat-harried denizens, but yet again proved to be a dampner for the rally.

The storm uprooted the stage and the canopy at the Ambedkar Maidan leaving two youths dead and a third battling for life. Three rallyists are reported to have died in accidents while on their way to the state capital. Over 60 were injured in rally related accidents.

Memories of the previous rally in which 16 BSP supporters had died in a stampede came rushing back. Some sort of a jinx. The officials had left the Maidan and had proceeded to the Charbagh Railway station to monitor the outflow of the multitude present to board the special trains.

Just then came the information on their wireless sets that three youths have been trapped under the stage. They turned back. But before they reached the spot, rescue work was already in progress. Jawans of Rapid Action Force (RAF) pulled out the trapped from under the heap of plywood and wodden frames. Two of them were rushed to the Command Hospital and the third to the Civil Hospital. Two of them died later.

""There were about eight of them pulling down the flower decorations,"" said Janardhan, a contractor who was measuring the barricades for payment.

""When the front pillar got uprooted we raised an alarm asking them to get down. But they didnâ€™t,"" he said. The youths were residents of Kailashpuri colony but hail from the adjoining districts of Lucknow.

The dead were identified as Sachin from Hardoi, a BSc student of KKC and Yogendra, also from Hardoi, a BA I student of Kanpur University. The third youth, Naveen, is a resident of Unnao.

9,MPs panel backs DD in tax battle with govt,"NEW DELHI: In its battle with the government on the question of paying taxes, Doordarshan has found support from unexpected quarters - the standing committee on IT headed by Opposition stalwart Somnath Chatterjee.

The problem arose with the finance minister''s budget proposal last year amending the law that had so far given the Prasar Bharati corporation tax exemption being a wing of the government.

While amending section 22 of the Prasar Bharati Act, the government argued that the arms of the corporation - DD and All India Radio - had come of age, occupying space in the marketplace and working on commercial lines. No such tax exemptions, it was reasoned, were necessary any longer.

While the broadcaster expressed its inability to pay income tax on the precise plea that as a loss-making organisation it was being supported by budgetary allocations only, the committee saw the issue differently.

In the report tabled in Parliament last week, Chatterjee said, ""The committee is of the view that section 22 clearly manifests that the intention of the government was to treat Prasar Bharati as a public broadcaster with a clear mandate and not as a commercial organisation.""

He pointed to the 10th Plan document of the Planning Commission which saw the programmes of AIR and DD as ""aimed at disseminating information of developmental issues and they cannot be treated merely as revenue generating enterprises.""

What has caused confusion is the broadcaster''s decision to brand itself as a corporation which gave an impression of its activity being of the commercial nature.

The committee, however, pulled up the information and broadcasting ministry for under utilisation of budgetary allocations for the software programme for Jammu and Kashmir.

""The committee is perturbed to note that even after the lapse of more than two years, the ministry has not been able to revive the J&K special software package,"" the report said.

The committee regretted that despite allocation of adequate funds in the 10th Plan television coverage in the region was yet to reach the promised level of 95 per cent of the population. It hoped that ""proper attention will be given to implement the special package in a time-bound manner.""

11,"40,000 trucks go off the roads","HYDERABAD: Over 40,000 trucks went off the roads in the state on Monday in response to the indefinite strike call given by the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).

The strike call was given by the AIMTC to protest against the failure of the Centre to fulfil their 10-point charter of demands. The AIMTC has been protesting against frequent hike in diesel prices and the VAT.

AP Transport Joint Action Committee convener Iqbal Hussain, in a press release, claimed the strike was total all over the country. Around 27 lakh lorries across the country were off the roads paralysing the transportation works, he said.

The government had lost over Rs 12 crore revenue and the transport industry sustained a loss of Rs 500 crore, while the trading industry lost Rs 2 crore, he added.

Hussain said the impact of the strike would be felt on essential commodities after three days as the JAC had given time for lorries to carry essential commodities such as petrol, water and vegetables.

Meanwhile, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu asked officials to take all necessary measures to ensure that the public would not be affected by the strike, particularly in supply of essential commodities like water, milk, vegetables and perishables.

Naidu, reviewing the situation arising out of the strike on Sunday night, asked the officials to engage the services of the RTC buses for timely supply of essential goods.

A press release issued here said the chief minister instructed the officials to engage company tankers to supply petrol and diesel wherever necessary. He asked the district administration to use tractors and auto trolleys to ensure sufficient stocks at PDS units.

He also instructed the chief secretary to direct the civil supplies, marketing and horticulture departments to coordinate supply of vegetables and fruits.

13,French investments still far off,"HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh still has some way to go before it can attract French investments, France ambassador to India Dominique Girard said here on Monday.

During a chat with reporters here, Girard said over the years, much of the French investment has been made in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. He said he met chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu here and discussed a range of issues.

""The chief minister comes across as a man of ideas, sincere and convincing in his presentation. He wants good governance practices to percolate to the grassroot level,"" Girard said.

He said companies are attracted by good governance and stability. ""They need a place where progress has started to make their investments. However, it is not a matter of whether it is Hyderabad versus Bangalore or Delhi versus Mumbai. Investments by a country in another also has to be viewed in the context of competition to attract such companies by other countries in the region like China or South East Asian nations,"" he said.

Discussing France''s opposition to the US-led war on Iraq, he said his country took a principled stand at the cost of losing a good share of profits that would have accrued to it from any post-conflict reconstruction activity.

""But France took a principled stand that no nation or a group of nations can wage an unilateral war on a country without the majority of the international community accepting such action at the United Nations. Any such action needs the sanction of the UN Security Council,"" Girard said.

France, he said, was not seeking any ''role'' in Iraq. ""Some of our friends have rushed to get a little piece of the reconstruction cake. What is required is a central role for the UN. The Iraqis do not want a puppet government. They should determine who rules them,"" Girard told reporters.

On India''s stand on the Iraq issue, Girard said that India had said that it was ''anguished'' with the war. The Indian stand is 99.9 per cent the same as that of France, he observed. India, however, need not take a position on the war as it is not a member of the UN Security Council, he said.

14,Gandhi memorial grabs govt attention at last,"PUNE: Union minister for tourism and culture Jagmohan on Monday announced a grant of Rs 2.60 crore for the maintenance and upkeep of the Mahatma Gandhi national memorial housed at the Aga Khan palace here.

Jagmohan made this announcement while speaking to reporters after visiting the palace.He said the department of archaeology has taken over the management of the memorial and the Union government had sanctioned Rs 2.60 crore for the first phase of its repairs and maintenance.

It may be noted here that The Times of India (October 3, 2001) had highlighted the neglect of the memorial and the failure of the state government to clear the annual grant of Rs 15 lakh since 1990.

Consequently, the lack of funds with the Gandhi National Memorial Society resulted in poor maintenance and failure to pay water bills that had mounted to a staggering Rs 20 lakh. Water supply to the memorial was cut twice in 2001 because of the default.

The monument also suffered from peeling paint, leaking roof, decaying woodwork and broken window panes, which also damaged some paintings and photographs of Mahatma Gandhi.

The Aga Khan palace has a historic significance as Mahatma Gandhi, along with his wife Kasturba, secretary Mahadev Desai and Pyarelal, Mira Behen and Sarojinidevi Naidu and Sushila Nayar, was interned here from August 1942 to May 1946. Kasturba''s Samadhi is built in the courtyard.

Acknowledging the plight of the monument and corrective measures taken, Jagmohan said the Indian Tourism Development Corporation would set up a library in the memorial premises to help people doing research on Mahatma Gandhi.

A sound-and-light programme would also be started here shortly, he said, adding that separate funds would be set aside for the same. Jagmohan said the Union government issued a notification on April 4 to announce handing over of the Aga Khan palace to the archaeology department.

The advisory committee will remain the same and comprise members of the Gandhi national memorial. ""Funds will be no problem for the memorial,"" the minister said, adding that, reconstruction and repairs of the dilapidated portion of the palace was being repaired.

The minister announced that the union government had also decided to take up the development of Dehu, Alandi and Pandharpur pilgrimage centres.

The Union government will shortly announce its plans to provide basic amenities to the devotees who throng these centres during the Ashadhi and Kartiki Ekadashi. The government is also planning to provide basic amenities along the palkhi route from Dehu-Alandi to Pandharpur for the benefit of over a lakh varkaris (pilgrims) who make the annual pilgrimage.

Jagmohan remarked that the Union government wanted to develop Pune as a hub for tourism in view of the rich cultural tradition of the city and the presence of monuments such as the Kelkar museum, Aga Khan Palace and Shaniwarwada.

15,JD(S) hits out at minister,"MYSORE: District JD(S) president G.T. Devegowda on Monday refuted the charge that his party leaders were trying to instigate the Vokkaliga community against district in-charge minister Vishwanath. He said, in fact, it was the minister himself who pitted various communities and caste groups against each other.

At a press meet here, clarifying JD (S) stand on Vishwanathâ€™s alleged remarks against Vokkaligas, he said, the JD (S) wonâ€™t indulge in ""cheap"" politics.

Recalling the controversial statements issued by Vishwanath in the last three-and-half years, Devegowda asked who provoked Vishwanath to issue statements which enraged communities.

""It was Vishwanath himself as education minister who embarrassed Krishna by describing Lingayat seers as Marwadis and who made light of Nagappaâ€™s kidnapping by Veerappan.""

Whenever an issue snowball into a controversy and boomerang on him, he retreats from the scene by blaming his political opponents, Devegowda said.

On Sunday, Vishwanath blamed the JD (S) leaders for inciting the Vokkaliga community against him.

16,Minister defends govt aid to cultural institutions,"MYSORE: Defending the Karnataka governmentâ€™s position of continuing grants to eight institutions, including Rangayana, for the next 10 years, Kannada and culture minister Rani Satish said here on Monday, it was the governmentâ€™s primary duty to cater to such institutions working for the preservation and development of culture.

After inauguration of the annual Chinnara Mela organised by Rangayana, the minister said, the government has been providing financial assistance to eight institutions for the last 23 years for development of language and culture.

â€œBut we are aware that we have also have to offer the same assistance to other institutions as well working in the same direction,â€� she noted, adding receiving financial assistance permanently was not a healthy sign.

Outlining the difference between permanent grants and grants, Rani Satish said the government would financially aid institutions involved in promoting art and culture. When the government expressed its intention to discontinue permanent financial aid to the eight institutions after 10 years, it came in for severe flak forcing it to retract its decision.

She said the government is ready for discussion on the issue adding that there should be some yardstick to grant financial assistance.

17,Naidu-NDA equation hinges on elections,"HYDERABAD: With his ear to the ground, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu is keenly awaiting the outcome of the Assembly polls in October, including in Madhya Pradesh, to see how far the incumbency factor will affect the political fortunes of his arch rival, the Congress.

Not that he is about to switch sides. But that will decide whether he should advance elections in the state 18 months away. Second will be his attitude to the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), whose government at the Centre he supports from outside.

As of now, it is status quo on both counts.

The decisive moment is yet far away. But he is clear on one score: The country''s one-time king-maker does not want to be the future king. For a man who thinks global and acts local, national is a role that Naidu insists he does not aspire to.

He fended off queries on all these issues while interacting with a media team from the national capital. ""Why do you want me to reveal my strategy 18 months before the elections?"" he countered.

Naidu does not place his future plans in any timeframe. But he insists: ""I am totally engaged in my state. I have no aspirations to come to Delhi.""

The approach is matter-of-fact, that does not over-emphasise the role of a state satrap and a regional ally of the NDA. He is careful not to send any negative political signals to Delhi.

This, at a time when the word in New Delhi is that Naidu, on whose numbers in the Lok Sabha the Vajpayee government enjoys the majority, is no longer the Centre''s blue-eyed boy he used to be. His wish list gets longer by the day. But there is a downswing in the millions he received earlier under various programmes and schemes.

Is there opposition from a trade union of those who want more but have less capacity and lesser imagination to utilise central funds? All he says is: ""If my state is able to absorb the resources, and utilise them wisely, why should anybody grudge it?""

""I have good relations with the BJP. But I am not sharing power at the Centre,"" he says matter-of-factly. He indicated that as of now, he would not like to disturb the current arrangement.

Would he formally forge an alliance between his Telugu Desam Party and the BJP? He would consider such a thing only on election-eve, he insists.

Is not the TDP concerned about the ""Hindutva"" platform that is gathering strength in the north? Naidu is silent. But those around him betray some worry.

At the same time, they insist that they would be able to prevent its fall-out in the state. ""Slogans will not do here. We have enough work to show,"" says Ummareddy Venkateswarulu, a senior TDP MP.

Naidu neither boasts, nor avoids talking about the widely perceived role of the king-maker that he has played for over five years now. ""They forced me, but I had refused,"" he says of the 1997-98 political roller coaster that pitch-forked him onto the national scene.

In politics, he emphasises, no two situations are identical, requiring identical action. But nobody knows what the future has in store.

24,Alternative school policy for dropouts,"KOLKATA: West Bengal has 3.9 million children who have either never been to a school or have dropped out. This was revealed in a Composite Child Registry, prepared by the state government, to find out the exact number of children in each gram sansad and wards in municipal areas.

Now under the central government funded Sarva Siksha Avijan, these children in 42,000 gram sabhas and wards will be enrolled in for-mal or non-formal schools by December 2003.

School education minister Kanti Biswas warned offi-cials at an internal national level meet on alternative schooling on Friday that the task â€œis very difficultâ€�.

â€œWe have to improve community participation and remove burdens of bureaucracy and only then it can be achieved,â€� he said. Already Rs 105 crore has been forwarded to the state under SSA in 2002-03 by the Centre and the first phase of funding will be complete in December when all children in India are expected to be enrolled in schools.

â€œWe have constituted a village education committee and ward education committees in all districts except Asansol and Kolkata,â€� said state consultant of SSA, Mech Bahar Sheikh.The registry has been de-veloped by each village edu-cation committee and is be-ing compiled by the state ed-ucation department.

The state had been late in realising the gravity of the situation, felt chief consult-ant, technical support group of the HRD ministry, Daya Ram.

â€œWest Bengal took four years to start bridging the gap and integrated the education programme at the Panchayat level. Other states moved ahead much faster in the meantime,â€� he said. The current situation is extremely important as district primary education programme (DPEP) was being phased out and replaced by the SSA.

But Shaikh complained that NGOs were not forth-coming. â€œWe want to involve NGOs and have prepared strict guidelines, but none of them seem interested in the education sector. In each district, we require at least seven NGOs,â€� he said.

31,Jilted woman commits suicide,"NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old pharmacy student, who was allegedly jilted by her lover, committed suicide on Monday. She left a suicide note, saying that she was having an affair with her tutor, who had refused to marry her.

After recovering the letter, the police arrested the tutor, Amit, and have charged him with rape and abetment to suicide.

Deputy commissioner of police (east) Nuzhat Hassan said: â€˜â€˜Although the woman has admitted to a relationship with the accused, it is clear from the letter that Amit had influenced her to have a relationship with him. He was apparently giving her birth-control pills.â€™â€™

According to the police, Amit met the woman about two years ago and he was giving her Chemistry lessons. They were neighbours in the Krishna Nagar area of east Delhi. â€˜â€˜Amit lives alone in Delhi and makes a living giving tuitions. The woman lived with her parents. Her father is a government employee,â€™â€™ a police officer said.

The woman developed a liking for Amit during her tuition classes. â€˜â€˜Amit took advantage of the situation and influenced her into having an affair with him,â€™â€™ the officer added. The woman apparently agreed to the relationship after Amit promised to marry her. Hassan said:â€˜â€˜The letter clearly states the womanâ€™s wish. She wanted to marry Amit and, therefore, agreed to the relationship.â€™â€™

But when she broached the topic of marriage, the accused allegedly refused to speak about it. Her letter indicated that he was persuading her to have a relationship with his friend. As a result the woman became depressed.

At 10 pm on Monday, the woman consumed sulphose tablets before sleeping. Her parents, however, got worried when she started vomiting. â€˜â€˜When the womanâ€™s elder brother rushed to her rescue, she told him everything that had happened,â€™â€™ Hassan said. The woman was taken to a private hospital where she was declared dead on arrival.

Although the police was informed immediately, they arrested the accused on Tuesday morning after recovering the hand-written suicide note. The womanâ€™s parents say that she was an extremely bright student and had stood first in her Class 11 examinations.
