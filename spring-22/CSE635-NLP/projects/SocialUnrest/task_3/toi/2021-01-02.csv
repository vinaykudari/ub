0,Growth story fuels the rally,"NEW DELHI: The Sensex took a huge swig of the feel-good tonic over the New Year to take the 30-share index beyond 6,000 points on Friday. The closing figure â€” 6026.59 points â€” is the highest ever and signals a staggering bull run that started in May 2003, when the market was hovering around 3000.

Market players insist that the rally â€” fuelled by huge foreign institutional investment of over Rs 35,000 crore in the last one year â€” is here to stay. Their reasoning: the economy should grow at around 8 per cent in 2003-04, companies are leaner and meaner, consumer confidence and spending are up, and even the hurly-burly of elections has not dampened sentiment.

Ironically, retail investors have, by and large, not benefited from the bull run. And now, when the market touches a new high, experts are warning that retail investors should tread carefully.

â€˜â€˜The sharp run up in stock prices and increased volatility has enhanced near-term risks,â€™â€™ said R Sukumar, CIO of Franklin Templeton, which has total fund size of Rs 10,000 crore. Sukumar warned that retail investors should not get carried away by the â€˜â€˜super-normalâ€™â€™ returns in recent times. Looking ahead, he argued, stock price movements would reflect corporate fundamentals.

Indian companies have no such worries. They can now raise risk capital from the market to finance their expansion programmes (a record Rs 22,000 crore IPOs are slated for this year). Thatâ€™s manna after a four-year bearish phase. â€˜â€˜The current bullish sentiment will also help economy in achieving higher growth,â€™â€™ said P K Choudhary of the credit rating agency, ICRA.

The Sensex last crossed the 6,000 level on February 23, 2000, at the height of the technology boom. Sure, the highest-ever level scaled was on February 14, 2000, when it touched 6150.69, but it closed at 5924.31. The market has been gathering momentum â€” it completed the first 1,000-points journey (to 4,000) in 98 calendar days, but took just 36 days to cover the last 1,000 points to 6,000. Whatâ€™s the forecast? ICRAâ€™s Choudhary felt the markets have already discounted the elections. The current rally is sustainable as it is based on fundamentals, he added.

2,'No feel good factor in farm sector',"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Pro-CPI All India Kisan Sabha on Friday described as hollow the NDA government''s claim that a feel good sense was permeating the country and held that no such thing was felt in the farm sector.

Farmers in the country continued to reel under the crushing impact of drought and unstable prices and the Union and the state governments had not come to their help, Kisan Sabha Kerala unit president C K Chandrappan and general secretary Sathyan Mokeri told a press meet here.

Adverse consequences of globalisation was most telling in the farming sector to which the government did not even bother to extend the interest cut on bank loans.

The talk of the feel good factor was nothing but a poll-eve stunt based on engineered statistics, they said.

Kisan Sabha leaders said that they were not against amendments to land laws without touching the basics like ceiling to ensure that the farm lands were utilised properly for the benefit of cultivators.

The Kisan Sabha planned a state Kisan Panchayat here on February 26, which would be attended by a large number of farmers and leaders and representatives of farmers organisations cutting across political affiliations.

The demands to be highlighted would include moratorium on farms loans up to Rs 50,000, rescheduling of loans above Rs 50,000, compensation and interest free loan to those who suffered crop loss, and fixing interest on farm loans at 4 per cent.

3,One-upmanship game at non-political do,"PATNA: Politicians cannot be apolitical even at non-political functions, especially when it is an election year.

The political one-upmanship witnessed at the function for laying the foundation stone of Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Phulwarisharif here on Friday is a case in point.

The barricaded roads leading to the venue were dominated by green RJD flags and welcome arches hailing vicepresident of India Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and â€œRashtriya Gaurav Laloo Prasad Yadavâ€� put up by the followers of junior Bihar minister for energy Shyam Rajak and party leader Ram Kripal Yadav. The BJP supporters had also put up their flags at some locations.

The state PRD announcer at the venue entertained the crowd by frequently referring to how quickly chief minister Rabri Devi and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav had given 100 acres of land â€œworth crores of rupeesâ€� to the Centre so that a hospital could be set up for the poor.

Junior Union minister Hukumdev Narayan Yadav played the Maithili card by making his speech in that language. â€œNow I have been given the constitutional right to make a speech in the language,â€� he remarked before an amused crowd.

Even the CM did not lag behind. In her speech, she rattled off a long list of things the state wanted from the Centre â€”- an IIT, an IIM, a special package.

â€œA special thanks to Sushma behan (Union health minister Sushma Swaraj) because many persons hailing from Bihar became Union health minister (read C P Thakur and Shatrughan Sinha), but nobody thought of setting up an AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) here,â€� observed Laloo. Union minister C P Thakur retaliated by claiming that the Centre has given Bihar projects worth more than Rs 45,000 crore and that the Prime Minister is willing to give more.

Not to be left behind, leader of the opposition in the Bihar assembly Sushil Kumar Modi thanked the Centre and expressed the hope that it would continue to provide aid to the state as it had done by way of the railway bridges in Patna and Munger, power projects, Nirmali bridge, inclusion of Maithili in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution etc.

He also took a dig at the state government for not giving compensation to farmers whose land has been taken for the hospital.

Even information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad made use of the occasion to offer an Indian Institute of Mass Communication-run diploma course in journalism at Patna University.

5,'Intra-party bickerings behind BJP's defeat Assembly polls',"SOLAN: The newly-elected state Bharatiya Janata Party president, Suresh Bhardwaj held the intra-party bickering as the major cause for the partyâ€™s defeat in the last Assembly elections.

Bhardwaj promised to set the things in the right perspective before this month-end, as the parliamentary elections are poised to be held earlier in April next.

He termed the BJP, as the most disciplined political outfit, but did not hesitate in admitting that the state party differences cost them the Assembly elections and that only made all the difference.

Bhardwaj told that as many as 11 Assembly seats were lost by the BJP rebels, in the last elections.

Nevertheless, in a mood to leave the past behind, Bhardwaj did not commit as to whether the part rebels would be re-inducted into the fold, keeping in view the impending parliamentary elections.

The decision canâ€™t be of my alone, as that has to be decided, jointly by the central and the state BJP leadership.

While claiming that the BJP would win all the four parliamentary seats in the forthcoming elections, Suresh Bhardwaj felt that that Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayeeâ€™s clean image and the overall developmental works, done during the five-year tenure of BJP-led NDA were enough to pull through the party safely in the next general elections.

Though not confirming the media speculations over the possibility of Vajpayee, opting to fight next Lok-Sabha elections from the hill-state, Himachal, the state BJP president, however, did not deny it.

Bhardwaj also hinted at knocking the doors of Himachal Vikas Partyâ€™s Shimla member-parliament, Dhani Ram Shandil to persuade him to join the state BJP.

Incidentally, Bhardwaj was in the town to participate in a fortnight-long vijay-vikas-pakhwara, initiated by the BJP, across the country, on December-25 last, on the birthday of Vajpayee.

The excellent poll outcome in the recently-held Assembly elections has put the party on the front and the efforts are to encash the changed political scenario to boost the BJPâ€™s fortunes in the next general elections, opined Bhardwaj.

7,Telgi's absconding nephew arrested,"MUMBAI: Tabrez Telgi, nephew of Abdul Karim Telgi, alleged kingpin in the fake stamp paper racket, was arrested by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in Mumbai on Saturday.

Tabrez has been taken to Pune where he will be produced before a Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court on Sunday. SIT sources alleged Tabrez was a key aide of Telgi in the huge scam.

Acting on a tip that he would come to meet an associate here, SIT officials laid a trap and arrested Tabrez on Saturday evening. Police sources said Tabrez had helped his uncle in spreading the racket in Mumbai and other districts of Maharashtra. He had also spread the racket in Bangalore, where he was the key distributing agent for Telgiâ€™s fake stamp papers. The SIT will quiz Tabrez about the politicians and policemen involved. One of them, assistant police commissioner R B Yennam, is already behind bars in the scam.

Yennam was the senior inspector of Dharavi crime branch unit in December 1998 when a case was registered against Tabrez Telgi. Yennam and his subordinate officers, Dattatrey Dhal and Dilip Kamath, had recovered fake stamps and stamp papers valued at Rs 3.94 lakh at the behest of Tabrez. The police had also arrested Jamir Sanadi, who was an aide of Tabrez.

SIT sources said Abdul Telgi had then met Yennam at the Dharavi crime branch to inquire about his nephewâ€™s arrest. The SIT is probing why Yennam did not arrest Telgi despite knowing his complicity in the racket. Tabrez was subsequently released on bail and he absconded.

8,CPM launches election campaign in West Bengal,"DURGAPUR: On the occasion of the launching of the Durgapur edition of Ganashakti, West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Saturday virtually launched the election campaign for CPM for the coming Lok Sabha elections.

Criticizing the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, he said an all-out effort would have to be made to unite all secular parties before the polls. He said the RSS and Bajrang Dal were obverse of the same coin which represented Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda.

The recent wins of the BJP in three states had alarmed the CPM, it was evident from Bhattacharjee''s speech. Neither the Jan Sangh nor the RSS had played any role in the Independence struggle, he said. The tactics of dividing the polls on the issue of religion was a dangerous signal in a democratic country.

Criticizing the Trinamul Congress for bringing the communal BJP in â€œpeaceful Bengal, "" he said the Trinamul â€œmust sail in a single boat, either the Congress or the BJP.â€�

Lambasting Trinamul chairperson Mamata Banerjee for calling a Bangla bandh on February 3, he said she was trying to destabilise the state by calling an â€œunjustified bandh.â€� The bandh on February 3 was absurd becuase the government had not issued any notification on taxes in panchayat areas, no meeting had been held so far either. The bandh call was with an eye on the Lok Sabha polls, he said.

He said no decision has been taken on imposing taxes on panchayat areas on animals and other things. â€œWe have won six times in a row and will do nothing to lose our support base in villages, "" he said. Instead, taxes would be collected from cities and towns for the development of roads, drinking water, electricity, sanitaion and health in villages, Bhattacharya said.
