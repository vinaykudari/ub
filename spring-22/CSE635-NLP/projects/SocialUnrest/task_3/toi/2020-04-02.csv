0,A performance incentive at MSEB,"PUNE: The state government will pump extra funds into top revenue-earning circles of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, energy minister Dilip Walse-Patil has said.

Walse-Patil made the announcement at a function held at MSEBâ€™s Rasta Peth headquarters here on Wednesday to formally declare the merger of the MSEB-Puneâ€™s rural and urban circles. It has been a long-standing complaint that revenue-generating circles do not receive adequate funds for infrastructure improvement.

â€œWe will now pump in the funds to further boost their performance and revenue-generation,â€� he said. It will ultimately improve the overall performance and efficiency of the MSEB, he added.

â€œFrom now on, every MSEB circle will be treated as a profit centreâ€� Walse-Patil said. Each circle will calculate the power received by it in units and will be expected to recover money for every single unit sold. It will also be the responsibility of respective chief engineers and other top officials to ensure that every unit of power supplied to consumers is billed, he added.

Later speaking to reporters, Walse-Patil said the steps were part of the internal reforms programme drafted by MSEB employees to help improve the financial condition of the board.

â€œThe employees have time up to April 1, 2004, in which to improve MSEB, reduce transmission and distribution losses and recover arrears,â€� he clarified.

When asked whether employees would be given the freedom to disconnect supply to defaulters, Walse-Patil pointed out the government, on Thursday was scheduled to introduce a Bill in the assembly to make power thefts a non-bailable and cognisable offence.

â€œOnce the Bill is passed, MSEB employees will have all the freedom,â€� he said. The government plans to add 4000 MW to its generation capacity in the next five years, although the planning is at an early stage, the minister said.

â€œThe state will receive 500 MW from the Tarapur atomic energy plant, 250 MW from Parali Unit-II and plans to utilise the 450 MW capacity of Uran, which has been idle for want of gas. The state would also get its share from Sipan and Vindhyachal power plants of the NTPC,â€� he explained.

However, according to present projections, the government anticipates a power shortfall of 6000 MW by the end of 2007, he added.

Earlier, speaking at the function, minister of state for tourism Chandrakant Chhajed drew the attention of the energy minister to the shortage of manpower in the MSEB and said that more staff needed to be recruited to improve its functioning.

State public works minister Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil, MLA Sharad Ranpise, MPs Pradeep Rawat and Ashok Mohol, former minister Madan Bafna also spoke on the occasion.

2,GRP to get communication equipment aboard trains,"VADODARA: Travelling on a train may soon become a safer proposition for passengers in the state, with the Gujarat Railway Police making attempts to strengthen security in its precincts.

The department is co-ordinating with the Western Railway and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) for the purpose.

The idea, to strengthen security on trains, was taken up by senior officers of the GRP, along with the railway authorities, at a meeting recently. The new arrangements, suggested at the meeting, include providing communication equipment to GRP personnel present on trains, providing earmarked seats for the already existing mobile outposts on the trains and taking complaints aboard trains itself.

According to railway police officials, the move was made after it came to light that while policemen patrolled the trains, they often did not get information regarding mishaps or crime till they were informed by a passenger or a railway employee.

Officers added that the idea of providing walkie-talkies to policemen aboard the train was mooted to take care of this lacuna. This would help policemen to keep in touch with each other, as well as with the guard and the engine driver of the train.

Additional director general of police (CID crime and railways) A K Bharagav said that this and other such issues were discussed with the chief security officer of the Western Railway at Mumbai. â€œIf the personnel have the wireless sets they can know of any mishap or an untoward incident immediately. We have asked the railway authorities to try and arrange for the same,â€� he said.

Bhargav added that railway authorities had also been requested to reserve two or three seats for personnel of the mobile outposts on the trains. â€œWhile a personnel takes rounds in the train, another personnel can remain present there and attend to the problems of the passengers,â€� Bhargav said.

These personnel, at the outpost, will not only hear and act on complaints by passengers, they will also register complaints. â€œThis will be of help to passengers as complaint can be lodged as soon as the offence takes place,â€� Bhargav added.

3,HC threatens to fine state govt,"PATNA: Expressing its annoyance over the Bihar governmentâ€™s failure to submit even on Wednesday the detailed report on devolution of power and funds to the Panchayati Raj bodies in the state, a division bench of the Patna High Court, comprising Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice R N Prasad, said that in course of hearing of the matter next week a fine up to Rs 1 lakh may be imposed on the government for the delay in devolution.

Hearing a PIL filed by Bihar Rajya Panchayat Paris-had on Wednesday, the bench said the â€œdilly-dallyingâ€� by the state government in devolution of power and funds to the Panchayati Raj bodies is anti-Constitution because in the 11th Schedule there are 29 subjects which have been transferred to such bodies under the Bihar Panchayati Raj Act, 1993.

Construction stayed: Justice R S Garg on Wednesday stayed construction of the police station at Charpok-hari in Bhojpur district with a directive to the state government to file a report. Achyutanand and nine other villagers, in their joint writ petition filed in the high court, had prayed for stopping the construction work, which, according to them, was being done at a public place meant for Chhath puja and construction of a Sun temple.

Transfer of prisoner: Another division bench of the high court, comprising Justice S N Jha and Justice P N Yadav, issued a directive for the transfer of former Ranvir Sena chief Brahmeshwar Singh from the Bhagalpur central jail to the Beur central jail here.

Contempt proceedings: Justice Chandramauli Kumar Prasad on Wednesday issued a directive for initiation of contempt of court proceedings against the administrator of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) for non-compliance of the earlier court order for restoration of the payscale of petitioner Surendra Prasad Kushwaha, an employee of the Patna Water Board, and payment of all his dues.

The petitionerâ€™s plea on payscale had been rejected by the chief engineer of the board. He filed a writ petition in the high court against the chief engineerâ€™s decision. The government counsel stated that since the issue was related to payscale, only the PMC administrator could take a decision in the matter. The administrator had been given six weeksâ€™ time to comply with the court order and pay all the dues. Thereafter, a contempt of court case was filed in 1997. The administrator restored the payscale, but he neither paid the dues nor replied to the show-cause notice issued in this connection.

5,Admn yet to get govt order,"PATNA: The state government notified the ban on gutkha and pan masala on March 31. Two days on, the Patna district administration has not swung into action for enforcing the ban. For, it is yet to hear from the government about the ban.

â€œThe administration h-as not received any communication from the state health department. We have come to know about the ban through media only,â€� said a senior officer on Wednesday evening while explaining the district administrationâ€™s failure to chalk out a plan to put an effective check on the sale of such articles.

According to sources, the district administration will first identify the manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of gutkha and pan masala in the market. â€œIt will not be easy for the administration to put an effective check on the sale of such articles without bringing about an attitudinal change in the mindset of people,â€� said a senior officer.

6,Scrap anti-defection law: Naidu,"HYDERABAD: BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said there was a need for a debate on the question of whether a government should be assured of a fixed five-year term in the interests of political stability.

Addressing a special function organised in his honour upon his completion of 25 years in politics, Naidu said the anti-defection law ought to be scrapped as it has not served its purpose of cleansing politics.

Instead, there should be a law requiring a prospective defector to first vacate his seat and contest a byelection under the new partyâ€™s symbol, he said.

He also deplored politiciansâ€™ tendency to be too antagonistic towards rivals.

â€œSonia Gandhi is not my enemy, she is only a rival,â€� he said.

Naidu said the country needed to tackle the problems of population control, water conservation and â€˜Indianisationâ€™ of the education system if it had to become stronger. The national river link would not be an unattainable goal if the people played a participatory role, he said.

Earlier, union ministers Arun Jaitley and Ananth Kumar, actor Chiranjeevi and others showered praise on Naidu for his commitment to the party.

Earlier, when city BJP leaders called on him at his residence to felicitate him on his silver jubilee, Naidu voiced the imperatives for the BJP in view of the elections being about 15 months away. There was a need for the BJP to co-opt various sections of society to strengthen the party, he said.

The BJP president said he would strive to attract university students, and employees who have availed of voluntary retirement into the party fold.

Junior railway minister Bandaru Dattatreya, city BJP president Chintala Ramachandra Reddy, BJP Yuva Morcha president G Kishen Reddy, MLA N Indrasena Reddy, deputy mayor G Subhash Chander were among those who called on Venkaiah Naidu.

7,VHP assails Mufti's healing touch policy,"JAMMU: VHP leaders in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday criticised the ''Healing touch'' policy of Chief minister Mufti Mohmd Sayeed alleging that it was benefitting only a particular section of the Muslim Community.

In a statement issued here, the president and the general secretary of the state unit, Ramakant Dubey and Surinder Sharma said Sayeed was misleading the nation by claiming that his policy was against corruption and aimed at all round development of the state.

Warning the central government against accepting the ""deceptive and dubious projections"" of Sayeed, they said law and order situation in the state is fast deteriorating.

They also criticised the state government for disbanding the Special Operation Group (SOG) of Jammu and Kashmir police.

He alleged that Sayeed has given no firm signal to the perpetrators of violence about his resolve to deal with them with an iron hand.

He said even after the massacre of Kashmiri Pandits in Nadimarg, the state government had not adopted any clear-cut policy to deal with terrorist activities.

He further accused the state government of engineering migration of Hindus from the hilly districts of Doda, Rajouri and Poonch.

8,DDA vice-chairman arrested in Land scam,"NEW DELHI: CBI tonight arrested sacked vice-chairman of the Delhi Development Authority Subash Sharma on the charge of abusing his official position and taking a bribe for showing favours to a construction company and a private school.

CBI sources said Sharma was questioned by the sleuths of the anti-corruption unit of the agency for several hours and confronted with files seized from his office and residence.

With the arrest of Sharma, the number of persons arrested in the case has gone up to four. Earlier, Anand Mohan Sharan, Commissioner (Land Disposal) was arrested on March 29 which was followed by manager of DLF Universal Ajay Khanna and suspended DDA official Ashok Kapoor on April 1 and 2 respectively.

Sharma, a 1970 batch IAS officer from Union territory cadre, was also confronted with some files seized during the raids from a guest house in Asiad Village.

These files were of highly confidential nature and were meant to be with the Vice Chairman only, the sources said.

He was asked about the reasons about the continuous postponment on deciding on the Floor Area Ratio of a DLF building.

CBI had registered a case on March 26 against Sharma, Sharan, Commissioner (Planning) Vijay Rishbud and Director (Lands) Jagdish Chander for allegedly entering into a criminal conspiracy with DLF Universal Limited and allegedly demanding bribe of Rs 1.10 crore.

9,Focus shifts to civic issues in ward by-election,"

VADODARA: As the bugle sounds for the ward number 3 by-polls on April 27, both the BJP and the Congress have chosen to deviate from the tradition of wooing the Marathis and the Sindhis, and focus on issues like providing clean water, which has been a pertinent problem in the area, drainage networks and the cleaning up the Sindhu Sagar at Varasia.

The by-poll caused by Ishwarlal Lal Shera''s death in December, has compelled both the contenders to hook on to civic issues to appease the disgruntled populace. For over six months, the area has been getting polluted water with suspended particles for the first 15 minutes. Besides, the mushrooming of slums around the lake has aggravated problems related to sanitation.

Those in the fray are Congress candidates, Lalsheraâ€™s son, Jitu Shevani, former student leader Amar Dhomse, Congress ward president Bhagatsinhg Bhaghiya, Sindhi Samaj youth wing president, Pradipkumar Lekhrajani, Mohan Dalwani, Jayramdas Wadhwani, and Jayesh Jelwani. Representing the BJP are Gurmukhdas Hemanani, Parmanand Sharma and Girdhari Kishorani. The ward constitutes Sant Kanwar colony, Varasiya ring road and Lokmanya society, with a predominant Sindhi population, and Kalupura, Pithambar pol, and Navabazaar areas â€” traditionally dominated by Marathis.

Political experts feel that since Lalshera''s death the Sindhis, who are in a majority are feeling a void with the Marathis dominating the scene â€” with present councillors Sangeeta Barkhade from the Congress and Ashok Nelavde from the BJP. â€œBhagatsingh is the seniormost party worker and enjoys a credible position in the ward. Amar Dhomse is an emerging candidate and can offer contending parties a stiff competition,â€� says city unit Congress president Bikhabhai Rabari.

â€œThe focus of our campaign would be civic issues and the rising unpopularity of the BJP government in the state,â€� adds Rabari. â€œFor over six months areas like Sant kanwar colony and Mahadev societies are getting polluted water from the municipal supply lines and are now forced to install bore wells,"" says Sindhi Samaj youth wing president Pradip Lekhrajani. ""Besides the drainage lines laid by the civic body for Sant Kanwar and Mahadev colonies are linked by kerosene driven pumps for over two years which leaks most of the time, causing inconvenience to residents,"" adds Lekhrajani.

Senior BJP functionaries, however, prefer to be tightlipped over their party''s strategy, yet admit that they are watching the line the Congress would pursue. The party realises that the Sindhi community needs a representative, â€œWhile deciding the party''s strategy both the factors like need for better civic amenities and a popular candidate having considerable appeal will be discussed,"" says city unit BJP president Shabdhasharan Brahmbhatt.

10,CAG debunks govt claims,"GANDHINAGAR: Top Gujarat government officials have frequently declared that quake rehabilitation and reconstruction works in Kutch and the rest of the state have been better and faster than elsewhere in the world, compared to Kobe, Mexico, Turkey or Latur in India. But the CAG doesn''t agree.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi recently told the state assembly that the state had outpaced others despite the large scale of destruction. However, these claims have been sharply contested by the latest report of Comptroller and Auditor General CAG) of India. It says, â€œGovernment of India, NGOs and international agencies provided sufficient funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction works.

But, a large chunk of the funds remained unutilised, the progress of relief measures was very slow and in many cases, assistance was given irregularly.â€� The CAG, the report of which was placed in the assembly last week, underlines, â€œThe earthquake restoration work suffered from lack of co-ordination amongst various agencies, proper management and control at higher level. Thus, relief measures were tardy, inadequate and provided scope for misuse and lapses.â€�

The CAG says, â€œAs against the budget provision of Rs 7,293.26 crore and net grant release of Rs 2,994.31 crore, the expenditure was only Rs 2,306.41 crore (31.62%). This resulted in surrender of Rs 4,986.85 crore. Huge provision and low utilisation reflected unrealistic budgeting in the context of low capacity to execute the rehabilitation works.â€� Funds remained underutilised even while overspending on house construction. The CAG says, â€œAgainst the estimated cost of Rs 767.25 crore (March 2001), the actual expenditure was Rs 1,081 crore (March 2002) under the World Bank phase 1 programme. Increase in expenditure was due to payment to ineligible beneficiaries, increase in number of houses by 78,667 and upgradation of 46,389 houses to G-5 category without following identical method during initial surveys and subsequent surveys.â€�

A review of 1,151 quake-affected houses in Surendranagar district revealed the upgradation â€” to G-5 (total collapse) from the less damaged G1 to G-5 categories â€” took place â€œon a single day on September 28, 2001â€�. The CAG emphasises such upgradation is not free from doubt and requires investigation. It also noticed irregularities in Jamnagar city, Bhuj, Dhrol, Wadhwan, Tharad and Jodia. The CAG finds the health sector in quake reconstruction â€œtotally neglectedâ€�. The European Commission (EC) and NGOs committed Rs 358.13 crore for the reconstruction of 2,261 health department buildings. As the state government and the EC failed to agree on terms of assistance, just 153 buildings the cost of Rs 10 crore have been restored. Further, as against Rs 131 crore provided for relief farmers, the expenditure was only Rs 49.50 crore (March 2002).

â€œIn this, there were irregularities of Rs 7.14 crore on items like distribution kits to non-entitled persons, procurement of substandard storage bins, payment in excess of norms, payment duplicate documents,â€� says the CAG. Nearly 21,600 tarpaulins were purchased at Rs 1,175 per piece against Rs 225, decided earlier, resulting â€œunjustified excess expenditureâ€� of Rs 2.51 crore. The expenditure of Rs 7.32 crore on debris removal in Bhuj and Rapar was â€œnot free from doubt due to nonmaintenance of basic records like number trips, weight of vehicles, inadequate provisions, etc.â€�, CAG adds.

11,Centre sanctions Rs 536 crore as incentive to GEB,"AHMEDABAD: The central cabinet, at its recent meeting, sanctioned a sum of Rs 536 crore for the Gujarat Electricity Board GEB) as a special incentive for the concerted efforts made by the board to minimise its losses in the last one year.

A sum of Rs 236.37 crore has already been released as the first instalment of the incentive, which was announced by the central energy ministry under the ministryâ€™s Accelerated Power Development Reform Programme (APDRP). A total of three states were selected under the APDRP. Gujarat was selected for the special incentive because of the its introduction of reforms and other remedial measures aimed at reducing the financial losses and help manage the electricity boards in an efficient manner.

The recommendations were made by a group of experts headed by Deepak Parekh. The GEB was chosen for the incentive keeping in mind the boardâ€™s impressive performance in the year 2001-2002. Minister of state for Energy, Saurabh Patel, said that the expert group had recommended that the GEB should be paid an incentive of Rs 556 crore but finally the Union energy ministry approved the sum of Rs 536 crore.

12,Attempt to fix age limit for trucks is opposed,"MUMBAI: State transporters have a new ally their fight to retain their old vehicles. The Delhi-based Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training has opposed the attempt to cap the age of commercial vehicles, and said that such measures will only benefit the vehicle manufacturers.

The Foundation has also supported the option of replacing the engine, rather than the whole vehicle, to conform to stricter emission standards. In hearing a case on vehicular pollution in the city in 2001, the Bombay high court had ordered that 15-year-old heavy commercial vehicles be scrapped or converted to clean fuels.

The HC extended that deadline to April this year, and earlier this week, imposed a Rs 500 daily fine on vehicles which continued to ply, triggering a strike call by transporters. But senior officials of the Foundation said the move to impose an age limit was unnecessary and unfair.

â€œWe canâ€™t look at the air quality issue in isolation without going into viability,â€™â€™ says S P Singh, senior fellow and coordinator of the Foundation. â€œA country like ours canâ€™t afford to scrap our assets.â€™â€™ Fifty per cent of the national truck fleet is estimated to be 15 years old.

The Foudation says that 70 per cent of inter-state movement of goods takes place through vehicles covered by national permits, under which the age is already restricted. Because of poor maintenance and overloading, however, the truck owner has to shift his vehicle from national highway runs to shorter hauls between cities after six or seven years.

Mr Singh claims there is no need to scrap these old vehicles to improve air pollution. â€œEven a two-year-old vehicle may be polluting, everything depends on the health of the engine,â€™â€™ he said. The solution would then be to simply upgrade the engine to Euro II standards.

â€œTruckers are always upgrading their engines anyway. They canâ€™t run with inefficient machines, which consume a lot of oil and break down frequently.â€™â€™

Retrofitment of engines is an option which has also been mooted by transporters, but manufacturing companies like Telco and Ashok Leyland have not been confident about the technical feasibility.

Mr Singh says, â€œIt can be done.What is necessary is that the companies themselves carry out the retrofitment to ensure it is done properly.â€™â€™ In fact, the Foundation has only harsh words for the manufacturersâ€™ lobby, which will profit from replacement policies.

â€œEven in 1988,when the Motor Vehicles Act was being amended, there was an attempt to restrict age.â€™â€™

He points out that companies were capable of producing better vehicles years ago, but they did not do so until they were forced to by the anti-pollution campaign in Delhi over the last few years.

Mr Singh also stresses that the government should strengthen the inspection and maintenance systems, and that manufacturers should be more involved in this. Vehicles have to get a certificate of fitness every year from the authorities, and a pollution under control certificate more frequently.

â€œWhy arenâ€™t the sanctity and stringency of these being maintained?â€™â€™ asks Mr Singh, adding, â€œInstead of correcting monitoring systems, the onus has been put on the owner who has nothing to do with the choice of technology.â€™â€™

However,Mr Singh also disapproves of the strike that has been called by the Maharashtra transporters. â€œThey should just move the Supreme Court instead,â€™â€™ he says.

13,"Siddiqui tastes high, low of Punjab govt","CHANDIGARH: Punjab additional director-general of police A A Siddiqui, who was tipped to take over as DGP last year and was made to cut short his deputation at the Centre, continues to feel the pinch of his repatriation.

Siddiqui was DGP, Manipur, when, half way through his three-year tenure, chief minister Amarinder Singh sought him back to Punjab with a promise that he would succeed M S Bhullar as the state police chief.

However, it has not been a happy situation for the ADGP since.

To begin with, he was made to wait for a posting till a special slot of â€˜â€˜Officer on Special Duty (Law and Order)â€™â€™ was created for him. To add to his embarrassment, his salary was withheld for nearly seven months with the finance department saying that his post was not duly sanctioned.

Siddiqui wrote to the home department that the pay drawn by him as Manipur DGP should be protected, but the state government cold-shouldered his contention and the matter has rested with the government for quite some time.

Only a few days ago, sources say, it was decided that the ADGP would indeed get his due after seven months, but the salary of an ADGP, not a DGP as he had sought.

14,Significant increase in number of visa denials by US,"AHMEDABAD: The US immigration authorities have been rejecting greater number of visa applications. The number of refusals has dramatically increased in 2002-03, and an increasing number of Indians are losing out.

Piyush Shelat, a medical professional staying in the US for the last 10 years, had made a visa application in 1996 for status adjustment in the US after his wife Sangita Shelat received US citizenship. â€œMy application for adjusting the visa status was rejected within minutes,â€� says Shelat. He, now faces deportation, had overstayed on his visitor visa in 1994.

Many like Shelat have been turned down by the US authorities this year. With stricter checks, many, who may have otherwise been eligible for becoming US permanent residents, are presently facing deportation from the US, inform immigration lawyers in the US. Gregory Siskind, immigration attorney from Siskind, Susser, Haas & Devine in the US says that for security reasons, the US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has adopted a zero-tolerance policy on all cases.

â€œINS may reject the application for minor reasons, including status violations or incorrect answers on forms. Minute mistakes may also lead to application rejections,â€� says Siskind. In the past, the agency was flexible and would judge the overall circumstances when making decisions. From March 1, the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS) has taken over charge from the INS. And backlogs are again up at the INS since the switch. â€œIt also has an impact on my clients,â€� says Siskind. â€œObviously denials and backlogs are not good. With this, a personâ€™s immigration hopes could be dashed.â€� With increasing number of denials, the board of the immigration appeals system, a watchdog set by the US Justice Department in 1940 over immigration courts, is also swamped with cases. The changes pushed by attorney general Ashcroft directed the Board of Immigration Appeals to clear 56,000 backlog cases by March 25, notes Los Angeles Times.

A review conducted by The Times found that to meet this deadline the Board of Immigration Appeals rejected 86 per cent of its appeals in October, compared to 59 per cent the previous October. With proliferation of summary decisions without explanations by the board, â€œImmigrants are appealing to the federal court system in unprecedented numbers, creating another backlog,â€� notes the L A Times. Immigrants and their lawyers in the US are anxious over the recent increase in denials and the subsequent backlog of cases.

Robert Gottfried, an immigration lawyer in the US says, â€œAt the New York District Office and the Vermont Service Center, there are thousands of cases that remain unadjudicated. The Vermont Service Center is currently adjudicating employment cases received in the fall of 2001. The New York District Office are scheduling interviews for family-based cases filed in May 2001 for July 2003. They are supposed to shut down for interviews in the month of April, in order work on all their old cases that were interviewed but not fully adjudicated.â€� The checks also take more time because all applications now have to pass an IBIS security check make sure that the individual has no criminal or immigration violations, informs Gottfried.

And increase in application backlog has also occurred because the US Immigration and Naturalization Service at one point stopped adjudicating adjustment applications before implementing new rules of fingerprints and thorough background checks, informs Hamel Vyas, an immigration lawyer in the US.
