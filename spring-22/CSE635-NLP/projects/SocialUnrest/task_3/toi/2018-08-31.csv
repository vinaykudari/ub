0,Govt fears violence could spread,"ahmedabad: there is something more sinister about the communal violence that the city has witnessed over the past week than what the bjp government is letting on as of now. but with two persons killed in police firing and the culmination of ganesh festivities scheduled on saturday, the administration is all geared up for an escalation and a possible spread of violence. ""we are taking every precaution, not just in ahmedabad but also in vadodara and surat,"" said additional chief secretary for home v v r subba rao. he, however, said there was ""no visible pattern"" behind the communal trouble witnessed in ahmedabad so far and that the two flare-ups in dariapur and shahpur were ""not inter-connected"". officials said security in ahmedabad and some other centres had been tightened and friday could be a crucial indicator of things to come in the next few weeks. the authorities, at present, seem rather confused about the motive behind the low-intensity violence that is taking place in ahmedabad and believe it has the potential to spread to other areas and even flare up. surat is considered particularly sensitive as eight persons were killed in police firing during idol immersion two years back. a massive bandobast has, therefore, been made for the ganesh visarjan there. while a delegation of muslims led by congressmen met minister of state for home haren pandya on thursday, protesting against lethal police firing during the clashes, the officials felt the leadership of the minority community was no longer in the hands of the main opposition party. ""this is a hypothesis which has been given to us by the intelligence agencies and we would like the government to interact with a wider representation of the community,"" subba rao said. the government is aware that new organisations like the students' islamic movement of india (simi), ahmedabad muslim youth association, lok jantantrik party, bahujan samaj party, samajwadi party and others are trying to make their presence felt in the politics of gujarat which has remained bi-polar so far. however, the government believes that the current spell of violence may not be related to the coming by-elections to sabarkantha and sabarmati because there is not much of a muslim vote bank in these two constituencies. the bjp government is, in fact, walking a thin line because even outfits like the bajrang dal and the vishwa hindu parishad are not happy with the police handling of the communal situation. president of vhp's karnavati (ahmedabad) unit p c patel says, ""we will not tolerate any targeting of our cadres by the police under pressure from the minority community leaders.""

1,Chautala to hold another rally in 'Ajit-land',"chandigarh: haryana chief minister and indian national lok dal (inld) supremo om prakash chautala will address a kisan rally at bagpat, the stronghold of union agriculture minister ajit singh, on september 16. the rally is being organised by kissan pradesh sangarsh samiti, which is spearheading the demand for statehood for western uttar pradesh. chautala, whose party also supports the demand for separate kisan pradesh, has already addressed nearly four rallies in western uttar pradesh, where he lambasted ajit singh for his political opportunism and hunger for power. asked as to why he is doing so much sangharsh in western uttar pradesh, chautala told times news network, that it is not the question of sangarsh. my party is a national party and we have every right to work for our popular base in any state. in western uttar pradesh, ajit singh, who claims to be the leader of the farmers, has in reality let them down. his sole aim in life is to grab ministership and for this he keeps shifting from one political party to another. chautala, whose party is a con-stituent of the ruling national democratic alliance (nda) at the centre, had vehemently opposed the induction of ajit singh in the union cabinet on the plea that he was not politically dependable. political observers, however, feel that bharatiya janata party aligned with ajit singh due to political compulsion as being the son of late charan singh, he still enjoys some clout among the farming community of uttar pradesh where the assembly elections are due to held early next year.

4,KC canal farmers to lose a crop season to drought,"kurnool: probably for the first time in the last 100 years that the farmers in the ayacut of kurnool-cuddapah (kc) canal will lose a crop season as the authorities have decided not to release water to the canal for the khariff season due to the acute drought conditions in the district. in the wake of poor rainfall in the tungabhadra catchment area, the inflow into the canal have been at a record low level. as there is no sufficient water in the dam and the river, the authorities have asked the farmers to give up the khariff crop. official sources told the times of india that this decision would affect 1.75 lakh acres of ayacut.this year, the tungabhadra dam did not reach its full reservoir level (frl) of 1633 ft. the water level at the dam was 1631.18 ft on thursday. district collector g sai prasad said that if water was drawn from the dam for the kc canal, it would be sufficient only for 10-15 days. and if there were no further rains in the region, the standing crops would be affected. he said losing a season would be better option for the kc canal farmers rather than cultivating crops without assured flow of water. however, the farmers in this region are not accepting the reasoning. they claim that the paddy could still be cultivated with the water available in the dam.they allege that the authorities are indifferent to their problem. ""it is easy for them to simply ask us to lose a crop,'' 55-year-old venkatarami reddy, a farmer of bannuru village of jupadu banglow mandal, said. he said the government should take up the matter with karnataka and see that dam authorities release water to the canal. reddy has 10 acres of land near the canal. he said he had not witnessed such a bad situation in his life time. meanwhile, the farmers are planning to launch an agitation against the decision of authorities asking them to have a crop holiday. former minister byreddy seshashayana reddy will lead the agitation. the farmers propose to launch a massive dharna in front of the collectorate on september 3.

9,Police agree to relax meter rule for autos,"vijayawada: auto drivers in the city have virtually been given a free hand to fleece the passengers.the police are not going to insist on the installation of meters according to which the fare would be calculated. concurring with the argument of the auto unions that running autos on meters in vijayawada is not economically viable, the city police has decided to relax this rule. city commissioner of police n v surendra babu told the times of india that he did not give any undertaking to the high court that use of meters would be made compulsory. ""i only promised to curb overspeeding and overloading of autos,"" he clarified. the city auto workers union (citu) president donepudi kasinath pointed out that running autos on meters at the rates fixed by the government was not possible in a city like vijayawada. ""unless the minimum fare is rs 10, we can't ply autos on meters,"" he asserted. the go issued by the government fixing the minimum fare at rs 7 per two km and rs 3.50 for every one km thereon is applicable to vijayawada and visakhapatnam besides hyderabad. since the geographical area of vijayawada city is limited, running autos on meters is not economically viable, the auto unions argue. with the increase in the number of autos beyond 3,000, the auto drivers are forced to carry at least four to five passengers collecting almost city bus fares. however, the police have now launched a drive to prevent this overcrowding. after a meeting with the auto unions, the commissioner of police made it clear that no more than 10 children would be allowed in autos while the number of adults has been restricted to three. in the last couple of days, the traffic police are busy enforcing this rule and penalising the drivers who are violating it. more than 400 cases have been registered against the auto drivers in the city and rs 3000 collected as compounding fee, police sources said. with complaints against underaged driving increasing, the commissioner of police issued a stern warning to auto owners that vehicles would be seized if they were rented to minors for driving. there is need for the police to concentrate on prevention of rowdy behaviour by most of the auto drivers.this has become a nuisance in the city, especially at the rtc bus station and the railway station, feel the residents. easy way out * auto drivers say fixing meters would not be viable for them * they take four-five passengers and collect fares that are almost equal to bus fare * but police are now insisting that overcrowding of autos will not be allowed

10,Ban on entry of trucks demanded,"pune: the threat issued by city traders to down shutters notwithstanding, leaders of all political parties represented in the pune municipal corporation (pmc) have given the go-ahead to the civic administration for implementing the 12-hour ban on the entry of trucks on 17 designated roads. the support of party leaders for the ban attains significance as it was owing to their insistence that municipal commissioner t.c. benjamin had to relax it (between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m.) for the last three months. in fact, leaders of all political parties, excluding the republican party of india's (rpi) avinash salve, had written to mr benjamin urging him to relax the ban between june 1 and august 31. the warning issued by the poona merchants' chamber, that they would resort to an agitation and that the pmc would be blamed for non-availability of foodgrains during the festive season, has evoked sharp reactions from the rpi. said mr salve, if they do so, we will urge the collector to impose the essential commodities act and force the traders to open their shops. the rpi will stage a mass agitation if the traders resort to such pressure tactics and if the administration succumbs to their pressure. pune mayor datta gaikwad, who is chairman of the party leaders' co-ordination committee and a congressman, said, now there is no going back.we have cooperated with the traders by relaxing the ban for three months, till the dhankawdi truck terminus was being developed. now it is the turn of traders to co-operate with the citizens of pune, by obeying the ban. deputy mayor and shiv sena leader mahadev babar felt that the traders should realise that the movement of trucks on congested roads posed a serious threat to the safety of students. they should agree to the ban. but if they try to oppose it, sena workers will take to the streets, if required, to help the administration in implementing the ban,mr babar said. nationalist congress party's pmc unit chief ankush kakde too supported the order, saying, the commissioner has given an undertaking in the high court asserting that the ban would be re-imposed from september 1. it is now imperative for us to impose the ban and honour the pmc general body's resolution. the bjp's civic unit chief sham satpute felt that transporters and truck owners did not have a case now, as their demand for a truck terminus had been accepted. the bjp had supported the decision to relax the ban for three months only because the trucks arriving in pune in the day had no place to park their vehicles. now the pmc has developed a truck terminus and hence its move to reinforce the ban should be supported, mr satpute said. a group of congress corporators, led by former mayor vandana chavan and ajit apte, had also despatched a memorandum to mr benjamin urging him to impose the ban. meanwhile, the poona merchants' chamber has sent letters to all corporators, requesting them to relax the ban till the pmc constructs an alternative market in bibvewadi for the foodgrain trade. the ban on trucks is not a solution to traffic congestion in the peth areas, mohan oswal, president of the chamber, said. he pointed out that the ban was strictly for heavy vehicles and excluded light commercial vehicles like big tempos and matadors. if we start using these vehicles for unloading goods, they too will cause traffic congestion. the real solution to the problem is shifting of the market, mr oswal said. commenting on this argument, a senior civic officer said, it is not the pmc's duty to provide alternative land to the traders. and, if it is found that the light commercial vehicles are causing traffic congestion and endangering the safety of students, then we may impose restrictions on their use too.

12,Police personnel set to lose increments,"hyderabad: at least 60 police personnel, who did commendable work in detection of major cases and arresting wanted criminals, will lose an opportunity to get incentive increments, thanks to a new government order. the order, issued in june this year, has specified that it will have only prospective effect and the scheme will be applicable to the proposals received thereafter. however, the contention of the police personnel is that the proposals for awarding increments were sent to the government much before the order was issued and that it took considerable time to decide on the awards. hence, they said that they should not be penalised for the governments delay. according to them, all the proposals were finalised and sent to the government immediately. according to the go ms no 235 issued by the general administration department, the maximum cash award of rs 1,000, which was fixed in 1992, has been increased to rs 10,000. while considering the proposals, the incentive awards committee observed that cases are coming up for grant of rewards for the good work done by the staff over a decade, which is improper. all incentives should be awarded immediately after receiving the proposals, the order said. no thanks * government order to deny increments to late proposals for awards * police say propasals were sent on time

21,Sonia asks PM to provide grains for the famished,"new delhi: having decided to take on the centre on the issue of starvation deaths, congress president sonia gandhi led a delegation to prime minister vajpayee on friday and submitted a letter to him in which she expressed grave concern at the manner in which the entire food economy is being managed. sonia's meeting with the pm came shortly after she raised this issue in the lok sabha earlier this week and lashed out at the centre while emphasising the asymmetry between overflowing granaries and people famishing to death. having failed to nail the government on various economic issues in the monsoon session of parliament, the congress made a conscious decision to corner the nda on ""people's issues"" like saffronisation of education and the poor availability of foodgrains to the weaker sections. sonia, who is also leader of opposition in the lok sabha, rarely speaks in the house. this time round, however, she specially chose to speak on these two issues, indicating the priority the party attaches to these matters. taking off from her parliamentary intervention, sonia pursued the matter further by calling on the pm soon after the conclusion of the monsoon session to draw attention to the non-availability of foodgrains to the poorer sections. she was accompanied by senior leaders manmohan singh and madhavrao scindia as well as the chief ministers of rajasthan, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, chhattisgarh and assam. in her letter to the pm, she expressed her deep sense of anguish at the continuing paradox of mounting foodgrain stocks on the one hand and declining offtake from the public distribution system and prevalence of drought-like conditions in various parts of the country. she reiterated the congress demand for a massive national food-for-work programme to provide both employment and food security to the more vulnerable sections. she also drew attention to the sharp decline in the offtake of foodgrains from the pds, stating that this must force a fundamental review and rethink on how the pds is structured. congress cms, she said, are equally concerned at the prevailing situation and emphasised the need for protecting and promoting the interests of the weaker sections of society.

24,Krishna govt has failed on all fronts: Tanga,"gulbarga: the state bjp unit criticised the krishna government for its ""failure"" in giving good governance. speaking at a press conference here on friday, state unit vice-president m.r. tanga, alleged except empty rhetoric by ministers, no sign of development was visible in the state ever since the krishna government took charge. tanga demanded that the chief minister bring about amendment to provide special reservation to candidates of the hyderabad-karnataka region in education and employment sectors. he said a proposal should be sent to the union government immediately to bridge regional imbalance. explaining the pathetic conditions of government hospitals in the district where ""corruption is all-pervasive"", tanga said the health department itself is in a shambles. five out of 10 taluk hospitals do not have doctors and necessary infrastructure. ""the government makes hollow claims of building hospitals. but buildings alone do not make institutions,"" he asserted. pooh-poohing the public works minister's claims that he has enough funds for works, tanga said no improvement was visible as far as the condition of roads was concerned. ""though the government was convinced about rampant corruption in the water supply and drainage board, it has not taken any action so far."" taking a dig at the home department for the law and order situation in bellary and shimoga incidents, he said, ""the lesser said, the better."" tanga demanded a white paper on the drought relief works as he alleged the government has not spent all the funds allotted by the centre.

25,'No rabies vaccine in govt hospitals',"bangalore: bjp leader s. suresh kumar on friday alleged that the anti-rabies vaccine to treat rabies victims is not available in any of the bcc or government hospitals. the bcc is neither taking steps to control the stray-dog menace nor making available the vaccine. ``as a result, those who are affected by this dreaded disease are left to die. funds are spent for animal birth control programme, but there seems to be no funds to procure this vaccine for human beings."" urging the bmp to direct animal welfare organisations to provide shelter to all ""ownerless"" dogs, kumar said according to the karnataka municipal corporation (kmc) act, there should be an owner for every dog. according to a recent survey, there were over two lakh stray dogs in bangalore city alone and the figure is expected to rise to seven lakh in the next four years. probe sought: kumar demanded a corps of detective (cod) probe into the financial irregularities and appoint an administrator to the state unit of bharat scouts and guides. the government has not initiated any action against the unit inspite of the cag report pointing out misappropriation of funds and maladministration. "" they receive rs 1.11 crore government grants but guidelines to utilise these funds are flouted. an organisation which is supposed to inculcate good values in the youth is today a perfect example for corruption,"" he alleged. the number of students trained by the unit was also dwindling. the number of scouts had reduced from 5,311 to 165 during the last one year while the guides strength had gone down from 2,706 to 327 in a year's time.""

26,Badal protests centre's move on refinery,"chandigarh: chief minister parkash singh badal has taken strong objection to the proposed policy option slated for discussion in the national development council meeting advocating the slowing down of new grassroot refineries in view of alleged excess capacity. in a demi-official letter to prime minister atal behari vajpayee on the eve of the ndc meeting scheduled to take place in new delhi on saturday, the chief minister said inclusion of such a policy option on the ndc agenda appeared to be ""a highly motivated attempt to derail the refinery project coming up in bathinda"". vajpayee had laid foundation stone for the rs 1,200-crore project in 1998. badal cautioned that any attempt to slow down implementation of the project could entail violent reaction from people of the state. the project authorities, hindustan petroleum corporation, have already incurred expenditure of over rs 120 crore with an immediate commitment to spend additional this year rs 220 crore. rebutting the argument of excess capacity, the chief minister said the present situation had arisen due to low growth in demand of petroleum projects in the past two years due to slump in industrial sector. badal expressed confidence that the situation would turn around soon and demand for petroleum products would shoot up in near future. he observed that the three states - punjab, madhya pradesh and orissa, where the new refineries are proposed to be set up, would benefit immensely by way of revenue generation and providing employment. he requested the prime minister to delete the discussion on the item from the ndc meeting's agenda.

28,Varanasi hero loses out to govt,"new delhi: veer bhadra mishra, the varanasi priest, engineer and activist chosen by time magazine as one of the seven heroes of the planet in 1999, has lost out to the government - temporarily at least. the union environment ministry has ruled against his proposal on sewage-trapping technology in varanasi, preferring a more traditional up jal nigam plan he has been opposing. after hearing both sides, the ministry has decided the up jal nigam proposal is ""more practical and feasible"". the only concession on offer to mishra is a small demonstration plant to test his choice of technology. it's not something mishra's ngo, the sankat mochan foundation, is taking lying down. one of its representatives here says they are approaching the supreme court to request intervention on this specific project. the ministry's decision comes after a long battle. all this while, the second phase of the ambitious, 16-year-old government plan to cleanse the ganga in varanasi has been delayed. the foundation wants what it describes as a cheaper, more effective solution to keeping sewage out of the holy ganga river. locking horns with the state and central governments on this, it demanded transparency in decision-making. varanasi's mayor backed them; april even saw a presentation on this in the planning commission. the government was unyielding on its choice of foreign technology - sludge plants and pumps heavily dependent on truant electricity. mishra maintained this system couldn't control faecal coliform even when there was power to operate it. and, it would need 800 acres of land for plants. the mishra-led team advocated a more natural, advanced, integrated wastewater pond system, a deep methane fermentation process which is completely anerobic, with a seven-km sewage interceptor running the length of the ghats in that city. this, the team said, would be more effective and wouldn't require acquisition of arable land; it wouldn't displace people, would ensure no sewage falls into the river in the religious bathing area and would be cheaper to maintain. ministry officials sceptical of an untried technology voiced doubts about a completely sealed sewage interceptor along the ghats and its acceptability among people - something mishra dismissed out of hand. but something officials did not. the environment secretary visited varanasi in may; a meeting followed in mid-july. among the officials on attendance was, for some reason, the managing director of the delhi metro rail corporation. ministry officials say ""nobody was willing"" to go ahead with the suggestion on a single conduit, without any opening, under water, with a treatment plant situated on land prone to flooding. ""this couldn't be approved,"" says the official. ""we can give them permission for a pilot project but not something on such a scale...we can't take the risk in a sensitive area."" that's just not a good enough answer for the foundation.

29,'Osho' an enigma even after arrest,"bettiah: till his arrest by the bagaha police in the done jungles bordering nepal earlier this week, the fugitive meant different things to different people â€” a social crusader committed to spreading the light of knowledge in the dark forests, a communist revolutionary sowing the seeds of an armed peasant struggle and even a missionary spreading christ's message among the forgotten dalits. the opinions vary even after his arrest. the only 'invariable' in the entire gamut of opinions is that the man mesmerised the poor tharus and oraons living in the jungle terrain. much like the godman whose name he has adopted - osho. that was the name hundreds of men and women chanted outside the laukaria police station demanding their messiah's release. the bagaha police had been wise enough to shift its prize catch to safer confines for interrogation. in search of a story in the dense done forests, a fortnight before osho's arrest, this correspondent heard tales of maoist training camps in the hills above. there are more women than men in the camps, all wearing red shirts,"" a farmer said. an oraon tribal confirmed the presence of the 'lal salaam party'. it is difficult to track them,"" he said. the picturesque but remote done forest has long been agog with the activities of the utpidit mukti vahini, an armed militia of tharus and oraons. osho was said to be their master strategist, ideologue and supreme commander. osho set up the jan shiksha kendra at sundarpur village ten years ago. his fame and following soon spread in the area. osho reportedly went underground in december, 2000, after the murder of one billar yadav, alleged to be police informer. a wanted man in police records, osho was arrested earlier this week alongwith a lot of allegedly 'inflammable' literature. sources stated that the seized literature indicate his links with the banned maoist communist centre and even the peoples war group. however, his area of operation, close to the nepal border, give rise to suspicions of possible links with nepali maoists. the suspicion gets credence with reports of nepali youth being trained in these jungles on the border. osho is believed to have denied these links during his interrogation. a resident of surajkund in haryana, narendra kumar, reportedly became a disciple of godman rajneesh and later adopted his name osho. an engineering graduate from bit, mesra, osho tried his hand at different jobs and then joined the jawahar lal nehru university, new delhi, in the late 1970s, by then a nursery of radical left influences. it is an interesting coincidence that the nepali maoist leader, babu mani bhattarari went to jnu at around the same time. osho is believed to have told his interrogators that he came to this border area first in the early 1980s at the invitation of pitamber singh, the cpi leader and later mp. he later took up the invitation of another cpi leader, lal babu singh to adopt the remote done as nursery of peoples revolution. osho remains an enigma even after his arrest.""he is a hard nut,"" informed sources told the times of india. bagaha sp amrendra kumar it remains to be seen whether the sleuths will be able to establish that the man who researched on the peasant struggle in hazaribagh for his doctorate is indeed the man who armed and trained the peasants here for a revolution with such surgical precision. or, whether, he is a comrade in arms with the nepal maoists.
