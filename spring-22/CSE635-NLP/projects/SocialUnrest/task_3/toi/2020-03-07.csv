0,Many allies oppose govt on women's Bill,"NEW DELHI: The all-party-meeting convened by PM Vajpayee on Friday to evolve a consensus on the controversial women''s reservation Bill ran into a host of roadblocks as several NDA allies joined the more well-known opponents like the Samajwadi Party and the RJD in rejecting the legislation in its present form.

While the Samata Party, Janata Dal (U), TDP and PMK stayed away from the meeting, the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal opposed the Bill in its present form and instead wanted the government to consdier the Election Commission proposal making it mandatory for political parties to give 33 per tickets to women.

Although there was no consensus at the meeting, the government later indicated its plans to get the Bill passed in the ongoing budget session. However, there was some ambiguity about whether the Centre will bring the pending Bill providing for 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and state legislatures or amend it in accordance with the suggestions from various political parties.

Deputy PM Advani told the meeting that while the government favours the present Bill, it would also be open to the EC''s proposal if there is a consensus on it.

""SP leader Mulayum Singh Yadav has sought more time to consult other parties like the Left and the Congress. Once he conveys his views to us, the government will proceed,"" parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj told reporters after the meeting.

While the Congress and the Left parties along with the BSP and the AIADMK wanted the Bill passed in its present form, the staunchest opposition came from RJD leader Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mulayum who not only wanted the percentage reduced to 20 and 15 per cent, respectively, but also sought a quota within the quota for women from scheduled castes, backward classes and minorities.

""We are not against reservations but we want to ensure that women from the poor and backward sections are not neglected,"" they said. Both warned the government not to rush through with the legislation on the basis of its brute majority and instead urged the Centre to work for a consensus. They pointed out that there was no consensus even within the ruling NDA while remarking on the absence of key BJP allies at the meeting.

These remarks were not taken to very kindly by the PM who told them firmly that though they were entitled to their views, ""parliamentary democracy functions on the basis of numbers and a minority view cannot be allowed to prevail over the majority view"".

Mulayum then said that he wanted more time for consultations with the Left and the Congress and that he would get back to the government with his final views within 15 days. The government agreed, stating it would then proceed on this matter in April, after the Parliament''s mid-session recess.

3,Punjab plans impetus for livestock farming,"LUDHIANA: Punjab animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries minister Jagmohan Singh Kang on Friday said that his government had prepared a first ever comprehensive programme for animal breeding, with the purpose of providing much needed impetus to livestock and dairy farming in the state.

Kang was addressing the state level seminar on the role of livestock in diversification of agriculture in Punjab, organised jointly by state department of animal husbandry, dairy development and fisheries and Punjab livestock development board at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) here.

Giving details, the minister said that the programme envisaged development of dairy, fisheries and related ventures as viable alternatives to absorb maximum number of young farmers. The department had already been activated to improve the livestock breeding, eradication of prevailing diseases among animals, enhancing quality of produce, exploring marketing opportunities and to minimise the cost of production, to facilitate improved competitiveness of milk and meat products in the international market, he added.

He said, a legislative framework had been prepared for the first time in country for animal enumeration on modern and scientific basis. Kang added that establishment of Punjab Herd Registration Authority had been approved by the state cabinet, which would shortly become law.

He elaborated that the legislation aimed at creating a comprehensive database of all the milch animals, keeping record of pedigree and performance of each animal and providing unique identification mark to the registered animal.

He added that 1.25 lakh semen doses of superior quality have been imported from New Zealand for quick genetic upgradation of our cattle. The selection of bulls was made on the basis of internationally accepted parameters, he said, adding that the imported semen would be used for artificial insemination to raise the milk yield to expected level of 5000 litres per lactation.

Kang said, his government was seriously considering to start race course at Ludhiana or Patiala on the demand of horse breeders, farmers and general public. The proposal, if materialised, would serve as boon to marginal farmers in the state to adopt horse breeding. 2,000 posts to be filled: Kang informed that around 2,000 vacant posts of veterinary doctors will be filled on contract basis shortly to enhance efficiency of all the rural veterinary hospitals and dispensaries in the state. In order to overcome shortage of veterinary pharmacists, the government had decided to impart training to 250 students every year.

Besides, all the veterinarians and related staff would be asked to attend compulsory training and orientation courses to update their knowledge. The government had also decided to honour outstanding doctors and staff members to encourage them but at the same time adverse entries would be recorded in the annual confidential reports, he added. About 36 doctors were bestowed medals in recognition of their meritorious services.

4,MC Polls: Cong rebels may spoil party's chances,"PATHANKOT: A large number of Congress rebels, contesting as Independents, may upset the apple cart of the partyâ€™s candidates in the Pathankot MC polls to be held on Sunday.

The expelled Congress members pose a big threat to the party candidates even as the Congress claims to get a thumping win in the elections. Some of them are hugely popular in their respective ward as they are sitting municipal councillors. Their only grouse is that they have been a victim of groupism within the Congress and were denied party tickets because they belonged to Pathankot MLA Ashok Sharmaâ€™s faction. The Bhinder faction led by Rakesh Kumar Pammi got majority of the tickets for 33 wards.

Panna Lal Bhatia, sitting municipal councillor and Congress rebel contesting as an Independent, seems to be way ahead of the Congress candidate Balwan Singh in Indira Colony ward with the SAD-BJP candidate Manjit Singh having withdrawn his candidature as a mark of protest over non-accommodation of the SAD candidates by the BJP.

Having nurtured his constituency during his present stint as the sitting municipal councillor, Bhatiaâ€™s campaign was more colourful than the official candidate of the Congress.

Ramesh Tola, another Congress rebel who is also a sitting municipal councillor, is giving sleepless nights to his opponents. Tola enjoys close rapport with the voters of his ward for having done development work there. He also blames the city president Pammi for being denied a ticket.

Another Congress rebel Sanjay Saini also poses a formidable threat to the Congress candidate. Similarly, Pathankot Youth Congress president Gopal Mahajan, who was also denied a party ticket, has fielded his wife against the partyâ€™s candidate Jeevan Jyoti. Vijay Kumar, Joginder Pehalwan and Billa are some of the other Congress rebels contesting as Independents. According to political observers, if half of these rebels manage to defeat the Congress candidates, it may prove to be a costly affair for the party.

5,Cynicism prevails over MC polls,"HOSHIARPUR: Does it matter whether the BJP-SAD combine retains power or the Congress wrests it from them in the forthcoming Municipal Committee (MC) elections on Sunday? If one goes with the majority vote then people care less for who wins or loses. The obvious reason being the pathetic condition of the city.

With the city almost bearing the look of one big garbage can strewn all over, citizens of Hoshiarpur are almost unanimous in their opinion that whosoever comes into power things will remain the same. â€˜â€˜What difference will it make if the present lot of MCâ€™s is changed? My children will get the same unhygienic water, Iâ€™ll be driving on the same pot-holed roads and there would be uncleared garbage lying in my neighbourhood,â€™â€™ says Dr Juneja, a private practitioner.

While the two main parties, the BJP-SAD combine and the Congress, remain locked in rhetoric in an attempt to establish political supremacy, the fact of the matter is that none of the parties are fighting elections on local issues. None of them have released a local manifesto. â€˜â€˜Who cares if an epidemic happens due to the filth in the city. The Dusherra ground resembles more of a garbage dump,â€™â€™ says Vishal Saini, a businessman. There is not even a single park where one can go and take a walk in the evening, he adds.

A round of the city actually establishes the fact that no political party has taken up the issue of upgrading living standards of the people. Safe drinking water, better sanitation and improved roads doe not not figure in any political partiesâ€™ agenda.

There is no place to park your car if you go to Ghanta Ghar or anywhere in the city, says Amit Goel, an engineer. Stray cattle roams around the Gaushala bazaar and rotten fruits and vegetables cover the road in certain parts, he adds. While the BJP-SAD combine and the Congress remain busy calculating combinations and permutations of how to muster votes in various wards, peoples issues seem to be the last thing on their mind.

6,ONGC incurs Rs 50 cr loss on vessels deal,"MUMBAI: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has incurred a loss of about Rs 50 crore on three of its vessels that service oilfields and fight fires ever since the craft were given to Ganesh Benzoplast Ltd for maintenance.

ONGCâ€™s three so-called multi-support vessels have not been operated for more than 300 days, according to a letter sent by ONGC general manager Suraj Kumar to Ganesh Benzoplast recently. He said the vessels were inoperative â€œmainly due to non-payment of crew, withdrawal of back-up contractors and suppliersâ€™â€™. There are only 30 such vessels around the world, according to ONGC sources.

The vessels had been handed over to Ganesh Benzoplast in May 2001 with diving support by a foreign company, Dulam International. But Dulam International has backed out because the vessels have not been operational. Without any fire-fighting vessels at hand, the lives of those working on these oilfields is also at risk.

Because its own multi-support vessels are not plying, ONGC now has to hire vessels to service its offshore oil rigs from another company. ONGC has been paying between $30,000 and $80,000, depending on the condition of the vessel and the services it has to perform.

A spokesperson from Ganesh Benzoplast insisted that the ONGC vessels were in working condition. â€œOnly the diving equipment is not functioning,â€™â€™ the spokesman said. He claimed that ONGC had not released payments for the crew and supply of spares, leaving the company helpless.

Despite threatening to do so, ONGC has not terminated its contract with Ganesh Benzoplast. When the crew met a senior ONGC official on Thursday to ask if they would be paid, he expressed helplessness. â€œEven the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Central Vigilance Commission are inquiring into this matter. But I can

only advise you to approach the labour commissioner to get your dues,â€™â€™ he told the distraught divers and crew.

An ONGC spokesperson said that the file to terminate the contract (with Ganesh Benzoplast) is pending with chairperson Subir Raha. â€œWe will take a decision shortly,â€™â€™ the spokesperson said.

On Friday, irate divers and crew staged a demonstration at the Ganesh Benzoplast office at Andheri to demand their payments, according to the police. Cheques valued totally at more Rs 50 lakhs have bounced, the divers and crew told TNN.

Meanwhile, the Industrial Development Bank of India has seized a salt refinery in Rajkot

belonging to Ganesh Benzoplast for failing to repay loans valued at Rs 80 crore.

7,ZP driver's death: JD(S) protest march,"MYSORE: More than 5,000 Janata Dal (Secular) workers on Friday took out a procession protesting the anti-JD(S) campaign by local Congress leaders in their effort to implicate district JD(S) president G.T. Devegowda in ZP driver Ramu''s death case.

In the memorandum, JD(S) leaders stated that they welcome any kind of inquiry into Ramu''s case who died in a road accident on February 27.

9,"Lensmen beaten up, Samata MLA arrested","PATNA: Five photo-journalists were severely beaten up allegedly by Samata Party supporters in the presence of party national general secretary and MLA Satish Kumar near the Income-Tax roundabout on Friday. Police have arrested the MLA and forwarded him to jail.

The photo-journalists had gone to cover the dharna organised by Samata supporters in protest against the killing of a contractor and Samata leader Kameshwar Singh near Punpun Ghat halt, a short distance from here, on Thursday.

The party supporters were reportedly angry over reports in a section of the media about the slain leader.

On receipt of information about the lensmenâ€™s assault, a large number of journalists blocked road near the Income-Tax roundabout. They also gheraoed the Samata Party office on Beer Chand Patel Path.

As many as 22 persons were arrested by the police from the dharna site. City SP O N Bhaskar confirmed the MLAâ€™s arrest. Satish Kumar had been named as an accused in a case lodged with the Kotwali police station by the photo-journalists under Sections 147, 148, 323, 341, 307 and 379 of the IPC. Former MLA and Samata leader Punam Kumari is, however, absconding.

The trouble began when Samata supporters attacked a lensman, Ajit Kumar, who had gone to cover their dharna. According to Ajit, a report published in the daily represented by him about the killing of Kameshwar had invited the ire of Samata supporters. When other photo-journalists complained to Satish Kumar, the party supporters attacked them also. Those beaten up this time were Ravi, Prashant, A P Dubey and Ranjit.

The news spread like wild fire among mediapersons who rushed to the Income-Tax roundabout and blocked the road. Police immediately arrested 22 persons from the dharna site. The MLA denied his involvement in this incident.

Then the mediapersons went to Samata Party office and gheraoed the same. When the Samata MLA reached there, the police detained him and took him to the Kotwali police station.

The mediapersons also reached the police station and sat on dharna there, demanding the MLAâ€™s arrest. But the city SP told them the police will investigate the MLAâ€™s involvement in the incident. Later, the MLA was put under arrest.

While talking to TNN, the MLA denied his involvement in this incident.

15,US lawyers jailed for duping immigrants,"WASHINGTON: In one of the biggest Green Card-visa fraud cases in the US history, two lawyers have been sentenced to serve prison terms for fleecing hundreds of immigrants, including Indians.

Federal judge, Leonie M. Brinkema, on Friday sentenced Arlington (Virginia) lawyer Samuel G Kooritzky to 10 years in prison and ordered him to forfeit $2.3 million in compensation for the ""massive labour fraud scheme.""

16,Pak lawyers observe Black Day against LFO,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan''s influential lawyers and opposition politicians today observed a Black Day condemning President Pervez Musharraf''s constitutional amendments which legalised his election through a referendum and empowered him with powers to dismiss the Parliament.

Opposing the Legal Framework Order (LFO), under which the amendments were promulgated by Musharraf ahead of general elections last year, the lawyers also urged the Chief Justice Sheikh Riaz Ahmad not to accept the three-year extension offered to him and other senior judges, as it was a ""dubious gift"" to get the judicial support for the LFO.

The country''s Bar Associations held a protest march, coinciding with the retirement of Justice Ahmad today, urging him to retire and not to accept the extension.

Lawyers and Members of Parliament, holding anti-LFO banners and placards, marched from the Supreme Court premises to the Parliament building while Bar Associations in the capital and four provinces hoisted black flags.

Political leaders joined the Supreme Court lawyers to show their solidarity and to devise an unanimous strategy to denounce the LFO.
