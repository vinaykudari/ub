0,Strict law on child trafficking sought,"HYDERABAD: No comprehensive legal framework exists to address child trafficking, Campaign Against Child Trafficking (CACT) activist Enakshi Ganguly said on Tuesday.

Addressing a workshop on ''child trafficking'' at IACIS(ASRC), Osmania University campus here, Enakshi said even the word ''trafficking'' is missing in the policy document of the government.

She said a rape victim''s trauma in the court was no different from a second rape and called for a child and women-friendly judicial process.

Highlighting the magnitude of the problem, she said 15,000 children are reported missing every year. Four lakh children and about 200 girls and women are forced to enter prostitution daily in the country.

On the pretext of eliminating child labour, the child should not be traumatised and forced into begging, prostitution and drug peddling, she said.

1,Abhijit’s arrest irks lawyers,"KOLKATA: The arrest of law clerk Abhijit Kundu as a Naxalite â€œsuspectâ€� has created a stir in the legal fraternity.

â€œIt is a grim signal to us that we should not even dare to defend legally those who are accused by the state,â€�

comments senior advocate Asit Ganguly. Advocate Kunal Mutsuddi of Alipore court, whose assistant Kundu was, has filed a writ petition (WP No. 12688 of 2002) before the Calcutta High Court. Mutsuddi, along with advocate Ashok De, were present when Abhijit was picked up on August 29 outside the Baripada district court, Orissa. The lawyers had gone there as defence counsels for 11 alleged Naxalites arrested from Mayurbhanj district in 1999.

â€œThe police swooped down upon us and whisked Sri Kundu away; they did not show any warrant nor any arrest memo nor cared to listen to me or Mr De but bodily lifted him away and we had no idea on whatever charges he was being taken or wherever he was being taken.

This left me in a trauma,â€� writes Mutsuddi in a letter to the president of the District Bar Association, Alipore.

Earlier, on July 9, the legal team engaged in the case, including women, had alleged that police had raided their hotel rooms at Baripada, humiliated and searched them and took away important papers without any warrant or memo. The District Bar Association, Alipore, condemned the incident in a meeting on July 31.

According to Mutsuddi, Abhijit was a law clerk duly certified by the court. He had also got permission from Baripada court for interviewing his clients in jail.

â€œSuch incident has deprived me of active assistance of my clerk in conducting the trial further,â€� he writes.

Trinamul rubbishes KLO There was no organisation like KLO and the killing that took place at Dhupguri on August 17 was because of internal conflict between two rival groups of CPM, Trinamool Congress leader Pankaj Bandopadhyay claimed here. He said intense rivalry among several top-notch CPM leaders had led to the killing.

2,Unruly protesters have field day at hospital,"KOLKATA: Patients had to bear in silence the unruly demonstrations that besieged the childrenâ€™s hospital throughout Tuesday.

All the opposition political parties, aiming to gain mileage from the death of 14 children at the hospital, did not care for the well-being of those children still in the hospital. According to the new law, 200 metres on either side of a hospital has to be noise-free zone.

Not only was this not adhered to, but the demonstrators even flouted the permitted sound level of 65 decibels.

â€œThis is bad for the patients. The tolerance level of children is even much lower,â€� claimed a doctor. On Monday, the Trinamul Congress demonstrated, while on Tuesday, it was the Youth Congressâ€™s turn. They not only gheraoed hospital superintendent Anup Mondal, but also forced a calf inside his room. Political leaders Paresh Pal, Krishna Debnath, Shukla Majumdar agitated among others.

The agitators pitched a tent just outside the hospital with loud-speakers in all directions to vent their ire throughout the day with the police remaining mute spectators. â€œIt is impossible to tackle them,â€� rued S.P. Dutta, assistant com-missioner of police (eastern suburban division).

When asked about the permission, he claimed that the police did not allow anybody to stage demonstrations in front of a hospital.

Medical Service Centre, a voluntary organisation of doctors, CPI(ML) and junior doctors submitted a memorandum to the superintendent through deputation. In the afternoon, Trinamul Congress activists led a snap demostration in front of Writersâ€™ Buildings demanding immediate resignation of the state health minister. Led by Paresh Pal and Sonali Guha, the demonstrators blocked traffic in front of the central gate of the state secretariat for about 15 minutes till they were pushed inside the prison vans by police.

3,Kanpur corporators protest assault on colleague,"KANPUR: Assault on a woman corporator in the Kanpur Nagar Nigam (KNN) house has created a sense of insecurity among the women members.

The women corporators have not only joined hands in condemning the incident but have also demanded security at important meetings of the nagar nigam. Mayor Anil Sharma has termed the incident as shameful.

An abortive attempt to strip Samajwadi Party (SP) corporator Mamata Sachan by Congress member Illiyas Ahmad in the house has left the corporators stunned.

Taking a serious view of the misconduct by its corporator, the Congress has expelled Ahmad from the party. Visibly upset over the incident, deputy mayor Chetana Sharma of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has resolved to provide justice to the victim. â€œThis is not merely a political matter. Itâ€™s a serious issue related to the dignity of womenâ€�, she said. Cutting across the party lines, women corporators of the BJP, Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party and the SP have resolved to ensure that the justice is meted out to Sachan. Chetana said civic representatives should exercise restraint in the house. She praised the Congress for expelling Ahmad.

The women corporators said it was a matter of great concern that a woman corporator was insulted and humiliated in the house. They said that the misbehaviour with Sachan had sent a wrong message to the residents of the city who had elected 110 members to represent them in the civic body. Though the nigam has witnessed several unruly scenes in the past, it was for the first time that a woman corporator was insulted in the house.

4,Figures show up state secondary board flaws,"KOLKATA: The state secondary board conceded on Tuesday that there were major flaws in the evaluation and tabulation of the Madhyamik examination.

The secondary board released figures,which indicated that this year around 20 per cent of failed candidates, who sought a review, eventually cleared the examination.

In addition, 25 per cent of those who applied for â€˜scrutinyâ€™, secured higher marks.

A total of 21,922 failed candidates had applied for post publication review (PPR) of their scripts. Of these 4,494 students have now been declared to have passed the exam. Of the 12,843 successful candidates, who had applied for post publication scrutiny (PPS), marks of 3,141 candidates have gone up. As many as 55 Madhyamik examinees had challenged the results declared before the high court.

But secondary board president Haraprasad Samaddar declared that in 50 of these cases marks were found to be in order by the court.

Samaddar acknowledged that a scrutiny of marks had led to changes in the merit list. As many as 12 students in the top 15 now find their positions altered.

â€œEarlier during scrutiny, examiners checked if every answer has been marked and also checked for errors in totalling.

But from this year I had instructed that every PPS applicantâ€™s answer script should also be re-evaluatedâ€�, he said, in justification of the discrepancy in marksheets.

Samaddar, however, admitted that some examiners might not have checked answer scripts seriously.

â€œFrom this year the Board will check if every Madhyamik examiner has taught in classes IX and X for at least five years,â€� he said. Similarly, the higher secondary council, too, has come in for severe flak this year with around 100 examinees having moved court.

5,Shotgun gifts 4 cr vaccination cards to UP govt,"LUCKNOW: The Central government would provide four crore vaccination cards to the UP government, to be distributed after the next phase of immunisation for the periodical health check up of children. Free vaccine would also be provided along with the card. This was announced by Union health minister Shatrughan Sinha here on Tuesday.

â€œBringing down polio cases to the zero-level is our top priority and we hope to achieve that within two-three years,â€� he said while talking to newsmen after a one-and-a-half-hour deliberation with CM Mayawati on the stateâ€™s health scenario.

â€œThe polio cases in the country have shown receding trend till 2000, but in the last two years, there has been a marginal increase,â€� he said, adding â€œthat is alarming and what is more alarming is that UP accounts for 60 per cent of these cases.â€�

â€œThe number is still in hundreds (350 recorded so far in 2002), but if we donâ€™t gear up now, it may turn into an epidemic,â€� said the minister, calling upon the opinion makers, community leaders, politicians, actors, religious leaders and whoever else having some following in the society to exercise their influence and pursue the leftover â€˜defaultersâ€™ to come to the immunisation camps.

Talking about the UP scenario, he said that Azamgarh (31 cases), Ambedkar Nagar (24), Moradabad (15) and Jyotiba Phule Nagar (14) had the dubious distinction of leading the districts with fresh cases of polio outbreak. â€œAnd if the number has increased, there must be some fault somewhere,â€� said the erstwhile matinee idol, calling himself as a â€˜baby ministerâ€™.

â€œNow, we would try to plug the loopholes. Jo hua woh nahin hoga,â€� he said, referring to the roadblocks like fund pilferage, inefficient government machinery and even resistance to immunisation from some communities. â€œThere is so much misinformation about the polio vaccines in certain sections of the society, like it leads to impotency, spreads AIDS and carries other diseases. Before starting the next phase we will ensure that such misinformation are checked first,â€™â€™ he said, adding â€œthere are 27 polio viruses and out of them 24 have been controlled.â€�

Earlier in the meeting, chief minister Mayawati assured all support of government machinery in the next phase of immunisation. â€œNo slackness on part of the officials would be tolerated now,â€� she declared later. The minister praised the state government for taking an initiative towards polio eradication. He also praised the CM for writing letters to 72,000 gram pradhans, soliciting their support in the Pulse Polio programme.

6,City govt to go ahead with own legislation,"NEW DELHI: Even as it decided to bring a separate legislation in Delhi assembly on operation and maintenance of Delhi Metro Rail, the Delhi state government on Monday tried to diffuse tensions with the Centre over inauguration of the Shahdara-Tis Hazari rail corridor in December.

The Delhi cabinet has decided to invite President A P J Kalam to inaugurate the first corridor of Metro Rail. While the Union railway ministry wanted Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to inaugurate the first rail run, the Delhi government had been pushing for Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

On Monday, the state cabinet settled on a neutral name, that of the President. Chief minister Sheila Dikshit would formally invite the President and the date of inauguration would be fixed on his convenience.

However, the polemics on who would control operations of Metro rail continued with the state government deciding to bring a separate legislation in Delhi assembly.

The Union ministry of urban affairs has already drafted the Delhi Metro Railways Operation and Maintenance Bill 2002.

Delhi state transport minister Ajay Maken said the Centreâ€™s Bill has excluded the state government from the responsibilities of running the Metro Rail.

He said: â€˜â€˜The Metro Rail should be managed by the Delhi state government as it directly relates to the lives of Delhiites. Our stakes in the Metro Rail project are same as the Union governmentâ€™s. We are both paying 15 per cent each of the total cost. So there is no reason why we should not operate the rail.â€™â€™

Maken said to pay up the loan taken from the Japanese Bank, which is 70 per cent of the project cost, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation will depend on its earnings from the Metro Rail operations.

â€˜â€˜Since the residents of Delhi would end up paying the maximum share for construction of Metro, involvement of state government in the project is important,â€™â€™ he said.

The state government would, however, have to seek the Union governmentâ€™s approval before bringing the Bill in Delhi assembly.

â€˜â€˜We would request the Centre to only decide on aspects concerning safety, accident claims, appointment of claims commissioner and deciding on the technical parameters for operation of Metro Rail,â€™â€™ Maken said.

Maken said his government wanted to have the final word in functions like fixing metro rail fare, finalisation of rail corridors and day-to-day operations of the Metro Rail.

The Delhi cabinet, on Monday, criticised the Centre contention that the Metro is a part of Railways and a Union subject.

He charged that the bureaucrats of the Union finance ministry and some ministers of the ruling combine has come under pressure of a gang of Indian capitalists to disinvest the public sector undertakings.

9,People suffer as govt 'abandons' Boring Road,"PATNA: Emergence of multi-storey buildings and new colonies along the long stretch of Kurji-Boring Road in Patna West in the last two decades has failed to awaken the civic authorities from their slumber. The latter failed to lay simultaneously more sewer pipelines and new water supply pipes underneath this important road to cater to the needs of the burgeoning population.The result was bursting of overfilled sewer pipes and worn out water supply lines, causing severe damage to the road at different points, thereby creating chock-a-block traffic during a major part of the day. This road runs from Kurji, along Ganga, up to the Bailey Road. It is an important link-road catering to the traffic needs of the people.Victims of the road-woes are thousands of students of different schools, located in Pataliputra Colony, Kurji and Digha. Their movement in buses, autos, private vehicles or rickshaws become very slow due to the traffic snarls throughout this link-road, specially at the bottleneck-like Raj Chikitsalaya More and the shop-line on the northern flank of the road near the LP Shahi Lane.According to a senior engineer of the new capital division of the road construction department (RCD), the Boring Road was narrower when the water supply pipes and the sewer lines were laid. But when the road was widened, the water supply line and the sewer lines came underneath the road. The cement pipes of the sewer lines developed cracks at different points due to the vehicular load.The RCD had earlier expressed such apprehensions in a counter-affidavit to a PIL, raising water pollution issue in the Patna High Court more than a decade back. But with the lapse of a decade, things have gone from bad to worse. As such, the two-km stretch of the Boring Road is the worst affected.The oozing dirty water damages the road and decelerates the pace of traffic at different points. A significant aspect of this manifested in breaking the road near the Krishna Apartment, the Jamuna Apartment and the Pandooi Kothi. Some engineers said that the town planners concerned should have planned laying additional sewer lines underneath the road before passing the maps of the buildings in the area.The pipes of old water supply line are worn out and have become porous at different points underneath the Boring Road, and this is becoming a perennial problem, said an RCD engineer. The rule followed by the RCD is to do minor repairs at certain points once in a year. Despite this, the RCD engineers had to repair the road near the Krishna Apartment four times last year. The engineer said they had to use jute to bind the worn out iron pipes of the water line near the Krishna Apartment as the Patna Water Board officials failed to do their job.Several big potholes filled with rain water on the said road has made the situation worse. Some RCD officials said tenders were floated for repair of this road, but money was not paid in time as the government did not have money, and when the money was to be paid, the transporters' strike started.Besides, unmindful construction of footpaths on roadside drains, construction of shops from the edge of the road flank and non-clearance of garbage from the road are some of the major factors choking the Kurji-Boring Road.

10,"Bihar varsity students, police clash","MUZAFFARPUR: At least half a dozen students and the officer in charge of the University police station were injured in a clash between the police and students belonging to the AIDSO on the B R A Bihar University campus here on Tuesday.Tension prevails on the university campus following the police lathicharge and arrest of five students.Vice-chancellor Nihar Nandan Prasad Singh had hardly rounded off his talks with an agitated delegation of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad at his residential office chamber when a slogan-shouting mob of AIDSO-led students gathered at the main gate of his house. The immediate response of the VC was to ask his office staff to invite an AIDSO delegation for talks.But within a minute, the AIDSO-led students broke the main gate of his house to enter the premises. When Rajesh Ranjan, officer in charge of the University police station located just opposite the VC's residence, tried to pacify the mob, one of the students hit his head with a lathi. The policemen present there went out of control on seeing blood dropping on the uniform of their officer in charge, and they started beating students with their lathis. While being chased, one of the students tried to snatch the rifle of a constable before the chemistry department bloc.This further enraged the policemen who assaulted students even after arrest. One of the students was given several lathi blows even when he fell on the ground. When one of the arrested AIDSO leaders raised objections from inside the police lockup, he was violently pushed with lathis by policemen.The lightning speed with which all this happened shocked the V C and other officers of the university. The AIDSO did not give them any chance to discuss its demands. According to the AIDSO placards left on the road, it was protesting against what it called the commercialisation of education.AIDSO activists' protest is believed to have been sparked off by the inauguration of four self-financed computer courses in the university on Monday. As the university is charging a heavy amount as fee for different vocational courses, the AIDSO has objected to this on the plea that poor meritorious students are unable to get admission in these courses. They are also protesting against the privatisation of education and private coaching.AIDSO office secretary Arvind Kumar had informed the media on Monday about its plan to take out a rally from the Shahid Khudiram Bose memorial to the university and stage a demonstration.

11,No govt plan to talk with transporters,"PATNA: The stalemate over the 34-day-old strike of transporters is unlikely to end soon with the government making it clear that it does not intend to hold fresh negotiations with the transporters in the near future.State transport minister told TNN on Tuesday the government has no plans for now to hold further talks with the strikers.Even the individual transporters the government has so far talked to, appear to be dissatisfied with the outcome of talks as the government has refused to budge from its stand of not rolling back the hiked road taxes.The Bihar Motor Transport Federation on Tuesday appealed to the transporters from outside the state not to allow their vehicles to run in Bihar, thereby extending support to the cause of the striking transporters. The federation also said that due to the strike, the employees working on buses and trucks have reached a stage of financial hardship. However, the federation has maintained that the agitation would continue until the government withdraws the hike in road taxes.The federation alleged that water resources minister Jagadanand Singh was issuing misleading statements that the government has reached an agreement with truck owners.The Bihar Pradesh Mini Truck Association has also blamed the state government for the standoff. The association said the government was ignoring recognised associations during talks. They appealed to the government to adopt a flexible stand on the issue for breaking the stalemate.

13,8 more children die in govt hospitals,"KOLKATA: Three more children died at the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children between 7.45 pm on Tuesday and 3.45 am on Wednesday.

Two-day-old infant Rina Chakraborty died of premature septicaemia at 7.45 pm on Tuesday. Later 9-month-old Sibananda Dutta died of broncho-pneumonia and two-year-old Nandita Mondal from breathing problems.

A PTI report also said at the state-owned N R S Medical College and Hospital, five children died on Wednesday, according to Superintendent S K Rudra said. But there was nothing ''unusual'' in such deaths, he added.

After several deaths over the past few days, the number of patients has sharply declined at the B.C. Roy hospital. While the out-patient department treated less than 700 patients, almost half the usual number, only 20 patients were admitted to the hospital on Wednesday.

According to hospital statistics, there have been 955 deaths between January 1, 2002 and August 31, 2002. In August alone, the death toll was 140. But if the B.C. Roy childrenâ€™s hospital is facing the heat, child patients at other government hospitals are faring no better.

At the prestigious Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, there were five deaths, which superintendent S.K. Rudra dismissed as â€œusualâ€�. The death of a child at the Baranagar hospital resulted in angry demonstrations.

In the paediatric ward of NRS, cats roamed free. A tabby hovered next to a child on oxygen with a tube draining fluids out of his chest. The mother could do little except try and chase the animal away.

There are, on an average, three children per bed, irrespective of their ailments. â€œWe cannot turn away patients and there are only 55 beds. At present we have 82 patients. In winter, this figure climbs to over 120,â€� Rudra said. The surgical ward has 60 beds and 84 patients.

14,BJP to contest 52 seats in J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: The BJP will contest 52 seats in the 87-member Jammu and Kashmir Assembly leaving 12 seats for the RSS backed Jammu State Morcha.

This was finalised after a day long meeting of central and state leaders on Tuesday to sort out the issue of seat-sharing with the Morcha, party leader in charge of the state O P Kohli told reporters here on Wednesday.

15,Bofors clinched Howitzer deal through conspiracy: CBI,"NEW DELHI: The CBI on Wednesdaty alleged before a city court that Swedish arm manufacturer A B Bofors could get the gun deal due to a conspiracy involving bureaucrats, politicians and middle-men furthering the interest of the company.

""Bofors managed the deal as there was conspiracy involving bureaucrats, politicians and agents of firm,"" CBI counsel U S Prasad told Special Judge Prem Kumar, alleging that the decision of the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi asking his Swedish counterpart Ingvar Carlson to stop probe in that country was contrary to the Indian government''s request.

The agency, during the arguments on charges in the Rs 64 crore Bofors pay-off case, said the agents helped the Bofors to clinch the deal through their local contacts in the Army, the bureaucracy and the political circle including the Gandhi family.

The counsel submitted that though the A B Bofors report had claimed that there was no involvement of middlemen in the deal, the then Indian ambassador to Sweden B M Oza, had asked the government not to make any judgement on the basis of that report.

Investigation revealed that after the Bofors report, Gandhi had conversation with his Swedish counterpart Carlson and told him that there was no need for further investigation by Stockholm, the agency said. This was contrary to what Indian government had initially requested.

CBI said that the involvement of middlemen in the deal is proved by the 1987 Swedish National Audit Bureau (SNAP), report which confirmed that Bofors paid commission to its previous agents in India. The SNAP report, however withheld the name of the recipient, the agency said.

17,"Antony, Karunakaran clash over power tariff issue","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The power tariff hike, thefirst major decision of the Antony government in Kerala, saw the outbreak of a war of attrition between senior Congressman K. Karunakaran and his bete noire A.K. Antony.

As the anti-hike stir was in progress, Karunakaran had sent his emissary to Antony with the seemingly altruistic intention of ""advising"" the latter to withdraw the power hike ""in the public interest"". The ""good intentions"" were however much publicised. Antony saw in it what it really meant.

The division within the ruling Congress party was more damaging to the government''s visage than the opposition Front''s obvious objections to the hike. The Karunakaran move saw groupism in the Congress coming to the fore once more. This move of Karunakaran is believed to have clinched the decision to roll back the hike.

When mediapersons pointed out to Antony on Wednesday Karunakaran''s stance about the hike, a usually reticent Antony countered, ""Has he ever said anything well of this government?"" Karunakaran''s opposition is to this chair, he remarked.

Karunakaran, quick for a repartee, immediately summoned a press conference and denied he has any love left for the chief minister''s chair. ""I have occupied that chair four times. I do not clamour for it"". The octogenarian leader also remarked that he sent his emissary so that Antony would not get into more ""foolish acts"".

18,Loopholes in law bind ACB hands,"PUNE: Even as the Government Servants Confiscation of Disproportionate Assets (GSCDA) Bill, proposed in 1998, awaits Parliamentâ€™s approval, the Maharashtra police have been waiting for a similar step from the state government.

In the absence of such a legislation, top officials at the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) find that government servants who have been booked in cases of corruption continue to possess and enjoy property that is found to be illegal and known to be â€œdisproportionate to their known sources of income.â€�

The ACB is, therefore, demanding a law on the lines of the one in Orissa, which allows confiscation of such property. Speaking to TNN, superintendent of police (ACB) Atulchandra Kulkarni opined, â€œCorrupt officials will feel the pinch only if a law prevents them from enjoying the property.â€�

Senior ACB officials point out that although such illegal properties are â€œattachedâ€� following a court order, the attachment only prevents the transfer, sale or leasing of the property. It does not prevent those accused of corruption from â€œenjoyingâ€� the property.

After the Orissa government amended the 1946 Criminal Amendment Ordinance to empower the police to confiscate properties of corrupt public servants, the Maharashtra director-general of police Ronny Mendonca made a similar recommendation to the state government in 2000.

Senior ACB officials today rue the fact that Mendoncaâ€™s proposal is still pending with the state law and judiciary department.

In one instance, the ACBâ€™s case against IAS officer Ratnakar Wagh filed in 1994 for possessing unaccounted property worth Rs 29.28 lakh is yet to come up for hearing.

An ACB official cited the example of a case filed by the bureau in 1980 at the Faraskhana police station against an inspector for possessing property worth Rs 3.38 lakh, which was disproportionate to his known sources of income.

Although declared guilty by a special anticorruption court in 2001, the inspector continues to enjoy the property for 21 years â€” and in order to continue doing so, has moved the high court.

ACB officials are also unhappy that they cannot prosecute a government official without sanction from the appointing authority. Often such sanctions are delayed by senior officials, thus nullifying the action initiated by the ACB.

The ACB has, therefore, called for a â€œdeemed sanctionâ€� authority whereby the ACB can proceed with its action if the appointing authority fails to take decision on issuing sanction within 60 days of sending them a charge-sheet.

â€œSuch measures are necessary to reduce the delay in pursuing corruption cases,â€� Kulkarni said. Unfortunately for the ACB, even this proposal is pending with the state governmentâ€™s law and judiciary department.

Both the principal secretaries of the law and judiciary departments, V.G. Munshi and P.M. Umarji, were not available for comment despite repeated attempts.

About delays in clearing corruption cases, well-known city-based advocate Pratap Pardeshi, who deals with anticorruption cases, told TNN that there were not enough judges to deal with anti-corruption cases.

â€œDespite repeated representation to the Bombay high court that at least two judges should given authority to deal with corruption cases, the high court is not taking any cognisance of this demand,â€� he said.

Mohanrao Deshmukh who has served as a counsel for the Central Bureau of Investigation in anti-corruption cases said that â€œtrap casesâ€� (relating to acceptance of bribe) are normally disposed faster. But in the case of disproportionate assets, it takes years for judgement as the court has to go through voluminous documents before coming to any conclusion.

19,Oath issue delays examination of riot witnesses,"AHMEDABAD: The examination of witnesses by the judicial inquiry commission looking into the riots has been delayed further. On Wednesday, after hearing an application pressing for administering oath to all witnesses, the commission said it would pass an order before September 17.

The application was moved by chairman of the Central Relief Committee advocate SH Kureshi seeking that the commission examine all witnesses only after giving oath. Witnesses'' statements recorded without administering an oath to them was against legal provisions.

He submitted that though such statements recorded by the commission are typed out on a printed form indicating that oaths were given to witnesses, in reality no oaths were administered by the commission, to the witnesses.

Justice GT Nanavati and Justice KG Shah Inquiry Commission had postponed examination of witnesses scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, after heated exchanges between chairman Justice Nanavati and Kureshi, on Monday.

""The practice adopted by the commission of not administering oaths to witnesses is improper, invalid and illegal. It is also against letter and spirit of the provisions of Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952"", it was submitted.

Section 4-A of the Act provides for summoning and enforcing reference of any person from any part of India and examining him on oath, he claimed.

Administration of oath and sanctity thereof would ensure that the witness concerned would speak the truth and nothing but the truth, it was submitted.

Making the commission''s position clear, Justice Nanavati said that the commission never refused to administer oath and would administer it whenever needed. He said that no oaths would be given to government officials.

He stressed ""this is not a court or a judicial commission"" and cross-examination of witnesses was allowed.

Senior advocate Mahesh Bhatt argued that the commission is bound to examine witnesses on oath, though it has a choice to summon or not to summon witnesses. ""There is no sanctity of a statement and there is no compulsion to tell truth, without an oath,"" he said.

He further pointed out that the Commission of Inquiry Act does not constitute an offence for giving false evidence to a commission. There is an offence under Section 191 of the Indian Penal Code only when evidence is given on oath....and therefore even if it has the discretion to administer oath, it should exercise oath for justice and equity.

The second contention of Kureshi was that during the course of cross-examination of the witness, the commission does not allow advocates to prove contradictions, if a particular witness makes a denial.

""The commission adopts such a procedure as a matter of regular practice in all cases and not with regard to a particular question. If the contradictions are thus not allowed to be proved, cross-examination becomes totally pointless and it is not possible to attack the veracity or credibility of the concerned witness"", the application said.

""This type of procedure is totally against the provision of the Act and the rules framed under the same and also vitiates the purpose of this inquiry"", it further argued.

20,Kannada schools in Kasargod protest Malayalam order,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S.M. Krishna''s office is expected to request the Kerala government to exempt about 500 Kannada schools in Kasaragod and Hosadurga taluks from taking oath that Malayalam is their mother tongue.

The initiative follows a letter from Kannada Development Authority (KDA) Chairman Baraguru Ramachandrappa on Monday. ``Teachers from Kasaragod complained that Kerala has issued a government order insisting all schools should display banners stating that Malayalam is their mother tongue and administrative language. They also insist that everyone should take oath to the effect on November 1. I want Karnataka to suggest that the grievance of these teachers be heard,'''' he said.

The contentious point, according to Ramachandrappa, is that Kasaragod taluk has been declared a Linguistic Minority Area, where both Kannada and Malayalam are administrative languages. ``So why should these people take an oath that only Malayalam is the administrative language? If they do so, it will be contrary to the Kerala government''s earlier order conferring Linguistic Minority Area status to Kasaragod,'''' he pointed out.

Karnataka is also trying to promote Kannada, but not at the cost of the culture of linguistic minorities. ``We do not insist that Urdu or Marathi schools should state that Kannada is their mother tongue. Malayalam is the state language of Kerala, but not the mother tongue of Kannadigas there,'''' he maintained.

The KDA chairman, however, admitted that Karnataka did not have any jurisdiction to intervene in a Kerala government administrative decision. ``All we want is a suggestion to the Kerala government.''''

Other than the suggestion, Karnataka won''t take any further step to ``interfere'''' in the Kerala decision. ``It is up to the Kasaragod people after this,'''' he added.

In the South, other than Kerala, only Andhra Pradesh has earmarked Linguistic Minority Areas. Such orders for the sole promotion of the local langauge haven''t been passed anywhere else, Ramachandrappa noted.

21,"Vaghela avoids clash, to visit Tarnetar on Sep 10","AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee chief Shankersinh Vaghela decided to put all controversy to rest by fixing September 10 as his day to visit the Tarnetar fair in Surendranagar, while Chief Minister Narendra Modi will visit the following day.

""There is no question of confrontation"", he told a press conference on Wednesday. But he added that the Congress had not planned any parallel programme to counter the Gaurav Yatra, however, ""If the BJP tries to foment trouble in the name of the yatra, we will prevent it"", he said.

This was part of the discussion at the steering committee meeting held at Gandhinagar, which was attended by AICC observer Suresh Pachauri. It was decided that the Congress would resist all efforts to instigate violence in the holy land of the Jains and defile the land of Gandhi.

Former MLA Shaktisinh Gohil said, ""Earlier, the BJP was to conduct the yatra from Ambaji, but for no reason they decided to come to Phagvel only to provoke conflict and create disturbance"".

Gohil reiterated there was no reason for the BJP to take pride as even Prime Minister Vajpayee and deputy-prime minister L K Advani had remarked that the riots were a blotch on the nation.

He took a dig at the BJP by asking if the party was taking pride in the fact that its national president Bangaru Laxman was caught taking bribe, the corruption in the coffin deals, the high power tariffs and oil prices, the woes of the depositors of co-operative banks or pride in the fact that the PM had to tell the CM to do ''rajdharma''.

23,Cong demands Singhal’s arrest,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday demanded the arrest of Vishwa Hindu Parishad chief Ashok Singhal and the entire VHP leadership for Singhalâ€™s â€˜â€˜confession of guiltâ€™â€™ of experimenting Hindutva in Gujarat.

It also charged the VHP with issuing a â€˜â€˜threatâ€™â€™ of repeating the Gujarat experiment elsewhere in the country.

The Congress said Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani would be held responsible for subscribing to the VHPâ€™s plans if he does not act against the organisation even after this confession by Singhal.

â€˜â€˜The very claim of the VHP to have organised events in Gujarat is a confession of guilt and a threat for future. The Constitution does not allow any individual or organisation to proudly claim credit for killing of innocent people,â€™â€™ it said.

24,RSS outfits plan to pin govt on anti-people policies,"NEW DELHI: The RSSâ€™ non-political affiliates are planning a series of agitations aimed against the â€˜â€˜anti-people policiesâ€™â€™ of the BJP-led government through the rest of the year.

The issues under scrutiny will be largely economic â€” the governmentâ€™s now controversial disinvestment policy, labour reforms and promise to increase employment opportunities.

However, RSS sources stressed that though the governmentâ€™s policies would be under attack, it would be carefully calibrated so as not to destabilise it.

The objective, these sources said, was more to ensure mobilisation of their cadres since with the BJP coming to power four years ago, the former has been far more in the limelight.

And whenever thereâ€™s been a conflict between the BJP and any of its affiliates on any policy issue in the past few years, it is the BJP, generally, which has gained the upper hand.

The result: The RSSâ€™ non-political affiliates have begun to feel the pinch of a certain amount of demoralisation among their cadres.

So, from September 20 to October 6, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch will criticise the manner in which disinvestment is taking place and focus on the anti-people policies of the government.

Through October and November, in the run-up to Parliamentâ€™s winter session, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangh will attack the World Trade Organisation, of which India is a member, as well as the â€˜â€˜anti-peopleâ€™â€™ labour reforms. And finally, on November 26, the Akhil Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh is planning a rally in the capital, the focus will be the education system and growing unemployment.

For the RSSâ€™ non-political affiliates, the four years that the BJP has been in government has been a test of how far it can influence government policies and party programmes. So far, the only success it has had, though mixed, has been the RSS-inspired Jammu Morchaâ€™s insistence on campaigning for the trifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir, something which Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani finally spoke out against as being inimical to Indiaâ€™s Kashmir policy internationally.

But RSS sources say that this round has been won by the BJP, with its decision to have seat adjustments with the morcha without concurring on the trifurcation policy.

The only point of agreement has been that the BJP and the morcha both feel that Jammu has been discriminated against.
