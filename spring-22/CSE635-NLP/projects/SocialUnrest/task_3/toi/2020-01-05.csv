0,Cong accuses govt of engineering defections,"LUCKNOW: Claiming that the BSP-BJP govt in Uttar Pradesh had been reduced to a minority, the Congress on Friday accused some state ministers and senior bureaucrats of trying to engineer defections in the party''s legislature wing.

Speaking to reporters here, AICC Secretary Subodh Kant Sahai alleged a senior bureaucrat in the state capital was conducting ""Operation Split Congress"" and the District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police had been contacting Congress legislators to lure them into the ruling coalition''s fold.

Sahai warned the bureaucrats of ""grave consequences"" if they became part of the game plan of BSP-BJP Government to remain in power and said such officials would be ""taught a lesson"" once an alternative secular government was installed in the state.

Denying the possibility of any split in the party''s legislature wing, he said all the MLAs were dedicated solidiers of the party.

Stating that the days of the Mayawati government were ""numbered"", Sahai claimed the party had the list of the bureaucrats engaged in the gameplan.

A BSP minister and two MLAs from the BSP and BJP had yesterday stopped a Congress MLA and asked him to sign some papers, Sahai alleged.

1,Hindutva to be BJP plank in all polls: Advani,"GANDHINAGAR: Deputy prime minister LK Advani, equating the concept of Hindutva with secularism, declared on Saturday: ""India has been a Hindu nation, hence it is secular.""

Addressing the first state executive meet of the BJP after the party''s poll victory in Gujarat, Advani indicated that Hindutva would be made the BJP''s poll plank during the elections in Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharshtra and Madhya Pradesh, as also the Lok Sabha polls in 2004. ""People ask me whether we will make Hindutva a poll plank. I think we should concentrate on good governance, security and development. But if the Opposition raises Hindutva, we will certainly make that an issue,"" he said.

Advani said this was the first ever election where the results in a state had affected the politics of the entire country. ""We should, however, understand what Hindutva or cultural nationalism means. Historically, whoever may have ruled different parts of the country, it is cultural nationalism alone that has united those living in India. Those living in the south visit the north, and vice versa, and this cultural nationalism needs to be understood,"" he emphasised.

At the same time, he sought to warn those who sought to be bitter while defending Hindutva. Suggesting that the Congress had failed to understand the pulse of the people, Advani said, ""If Nehru believed in his concept of secularism, those who followed him used religion for vote bank purposes. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has no problem in going to Ambaji for attracting Hindu votes. Rajiv Gandhi opened the gates of the disputed site in Ayodhya, again for the same purpose.We, on the contrary, firmly believe in building a temple at Ram Janambhoomi.""

Calling for repeating the ""Gujarat experiment"" elsewhere, BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said, ""The Opposition has been criticising us for making Gujarat a laboratory for Hindutva.We must take that as a challenge to prove it was indeed a laboratory.""

2,4 BJP rebels in UP return to party fold,"LUCKNOW: The beleaguered BJP in UP got the much-needed respite as four of the 10 rebel MLAs came back to party fold on Saturday.

Four MLAs â€” Shiva Kant Ojha, Badshah Singh, Anil Verma and Daya Shankar Verma â€” presented themselves before the media and pledged solidarity with the party, even as the leader of the BJP legislature party Lalji Tondon declared that more would follow soon on Sunday.

Tandan particularly named Narendra Verma whom he claimed was already on his way from Sitapur, Ganga Baskh Singh, Ram Pratap Singh, Chandra Mani Kant and Sarversh Kumar Singh. He also claimed to have had a talk with Ganga Bhakt Singh who spearheaded the dissident activities and declared that the veteran leader has also decided to â€œact like a disciplined soldier of the party by giving up dissident activitiesâ€�.

Tandon said that issues which had annoyed the rebels have been amicably resolved and they â€œno more harbour any ill willâ€�. Incidentally, a petition to disqualify dissident MLAs is lying with Speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi, who will give his verdict on January 13.

4,RSP hits out at CPM over panchayat polls,"KOLKATA: The RSP-CPM divide in South 24-Parganas took another turn on Saturday with RSP leaders alleging that the CPM was using non-attendance at the DYFI public meeting on December 31 as a ploy to terrorise the people before the forthcoming panchayat elections.

On Saturday, minister of state for irrigation Ganesh Mondal accompanied by local MP Sanat Mondal visited the houses allegedly ransacked by CPM cadres over the last couple of days. About 42 houses were ransacked on January 1 and 2, in Dhuri, Taldah and No. 7 Karambibi areas. According to Mondal, the men from these homes have fled fearing reprisals.

There was a CPM whip asking everyone to attend the DYFI meeting, but many RSP supporters did not turn up.

On January 1, a CPM supporter was shot dead. Some people feel these actions could be because of that.

However, RSP leaders said it had nothing to do with the homes being ransacked.

5,PSEB staff caught in farmer-govt row,"BATHINDA: The Punjab government''s decision to withdraw supply of free power to run agricultural pumpsets in the state and disconnect power supply to farmers who have not paid bills, has placed hundreds of officials in Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) in this area in a very embarrassing situation.

While the brewing discontent among farmers could be good news for the opposition parties, PSEB employees these days are facing the wrath of farmers. On a call given by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), farmers in some villages of the area have decided to not pay electricity bills. When PSEB employees went to snap their power supply, they were maltreated, roughed up and even detained by the villagers at some places.

The situation is more charged in Rampura Phool, Maur Mandi area in Bathinda district and Barnala in Sangrur district, where it is estimated that 35 per cent farmers had neither installed power consumption meters nor paid bills. As the area is BKU''s stronghold, PSEB employees faced stiff resistance here when they went to disconnect power supply of defaulting farmers.

In some cases, the employees were manhandled and detained by BKU members while, elsewhere, farmers themselves restored power supply after the employees left the village. Senior officers in PSEB are prodding the field staff to deal sternly with farmers not paying bills, but BKU, on the other hand, is persuading the latter to not pay bills. The union had organised a number of meetings in villages in this area and passed resolutions on not depositing bills.

It has demanded dissolution of Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Authority. Gurbax Singh, executive engineer of PSEB in Rampura Phool, said about 70 per cent of the 10,000 pumpset connections in the sub-division were regularised after installing meters and farmers were paying power bills without a hitch. As for the 30 per cent defaulting farmers, directions have been issued to snap connections. PSEB''s field staff has been demanding police protection since many of them were roughed up while disconnecting power supply.

Gurbax Singh said necessary protection would be provided. While the PSEB authorities claimed that about 65 per cent farmers have already paid their power bills, BKU leaders said they had started a special move for such farmers to convince them not to pay power bills in future.

6,"Polio cases rise, city govt blames UP","NEW DELHI: Alarmed by a sharp rise in the number of polio cases in 2002 as compared to the last year, the Delhi state government launched the third phase of the pulse polio immunisation programme here on Saturday.

As compared to 2001 when only one case was reported in the city, in 2002 the total number of cases rose to 25. In the past three years, such a spurt has occurred for the second time.

In 1998, 47 children were struck by the polio virus. But in the subsequent year, the number rose by 50 per cent to 73 cases. The spurt was linked to an outbreak of the disease in western Uttar Pradesh that is home to a large population of migrant labourers working in Delhi.

On Saturday, the Delhi government came up with similar excuses. Chief minister Sheila Dikshit said: ""Delhi has a large migrant population from Uttar Pradesh which is known to be the reservoir of the polio virus.""

""Delhi government has set up 7,200 immunisation centres in the city and will administer drops to over 25 lakh children in first phase on Sunday,"" Dikshit said.

But government sources gave different reasons for the failure. An official said: ""The programmes has been on for many years now and is solely run by volunteers who manage the vaccination centres. A sense of fatigue has set in among the volunteers.""

9,Patna zoo revenue hit by bandh,"PATNA: Very few people visited the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park on Bihar bandh day on Friday and hence the revenue collection from the sale of tickets too was low.

The total number of visitors on Friday was 510 only and the total revenue earnings on that day was Rs 3,000.

â€œThis is a record in itself as never in the history of the zoo was there such a low turnout of visitors,â€� zoo director Ranvir Singh told TNN here on Saturday.

On an average not less than 1,000 visitors come to the zoo daily, he added.

Even on the Patna bandh day on Tuesday (December 31) the total number of visitors was 950, almost double the number of visitors on Friday, he stated.

The zoo management was expecting a record number of visitors on the New Year Day on Wednesday.

As many as 5,872 people visited the zoo and the revenue collection from the sale of tickets was about Rs 1.45 lakh against the expectation of about Rs 6 lakh.

The total revenue collection on January 1, 2001 was Rs 89,000 which rose to Rs 2.47 lakh on January 1, 2002.

But the prevailing law and order situation in the aftermath of the killing of three innocent students in the city by the police in a â€œfakeâ€� encounter on December 28 had dampened the spirits of the New Year Day revellers.

Most of them preferred to remain indoors. According to the zoo director, biting cold was also one of the reasons for the low turn out of visitors on New Year Day.

10,Country's nuke policy should be flexible,"HYDERABAD: India''s nuclear policy should have flexibility and adaptability in the present international realities, according to Arundhati Ghose, former permanent representative of India at the UN.

Delivering a lecture on ""Future of India''s Nuclear Policy"" at the Institute of Asian Studies here on Saturday, Ghose, currently the UPSC member, said, ""there is no doubt that there is need to define and clarify concepts and positions to a certain extent, depending on current threat perceptions of the future evolution of power equations in the area"".

Ghose said the declaration by India of its nuclear weapon state status after the 1998 Pokhran tests, was a watershed in its nuclear policies and approach to the issue.

Speaking from the chair, former Chief of Army, Gen K V Krishna Rao, said there is a need to check nuclear technology passing into the hands of undesirable persons. ""There are people like Osama Bin Laden who were capable of producing crude nuclear weapons,"" Rao added.

11,Rejection of anticipatory bail need not result in arrest: SC,"NEW DELHI: In a major ruling, the Supreme Court has held that rejection of an anticipatory bail plea need not result in the arrest of the person by the investigating agency.

A Bench comprising Justice N Santosh Hegde and Justice B P Singh gave this ruling while allowing appeals by some of the Directors of Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (MAPL) against an order of Bombay High Court ordering their arrest after rejection of their anticipatory bail pleas.

""The mere fact that the bail applications of some of the appellants had been rejected is no ground for directing their immediate arrest,"" Justice Singh, writing for the Bench, said.

A complaint was made by the Provident Fund Commissioner against Directors of MAPL, a sick company. A PIL before the High Court alleged that police was not properly investigating the complaint.

The High Court, noting that their anticipatory bail pleas have been rejected, said that the only course open for the police was to arrest them. It then put Police Commissioners of Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune on notice that failure to arrest them would warrant their personal appearance before the Court.

Setting aside the Judgement of the Bombay High Court, the apex Court said, ""A person whose petition for grant of anticipatory bail has been rejected may or may not be arrested by the investigating officer...â€�

Justice Singh said the arrest of a person would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of the offence, background of the accused, the facts disclosed in the course of investigation and other relevant considerations.

""In the very nature of things, a person may move the Court on mere apprehension that he may be arrested. The Court may or may not grant anticipatory bail depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case and the material placed before it,"" he said.

There could be cases where the application for grant of anticipatory bail is rejected but after investigation, not enough material found against the accused to put him up for trial, he observed.

Assailing the Bombay High Court order, the Bench said, ""The High Court proceeded on the assumption that since petitions for anticipatory bail had been rejected, there was no option open for the State but to arrest those persons. This assumption, to our mind, is erroneous.""

In a case where, keeping all facts and circumstances in mind, an investigating officer thought it fit not to arrest the accused, the High Court had no justification to direct the same, the Bench said.

Referring to settled principles of law, the Bench said even in a closure report filed by the investigating agency, the Magistrate could disagree and direct the agency to reinvestigate. However, the Magistrate cannot direct the agency to submit a report in accordance with what he thought is correct, it said.

12,HC raps Delhi govt for stray cattle menace,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has taken strong exception to the city government''s failure to check the menace of stray cattle in the capital, causing traffic hazards and presenting the Capital in poor light.

Directing authorities to launch prosecution against the dairy owners who let their cattle loose on roads and imposing a fine of Rs 1,000 for each animal, the Court said, ""The menace of stray cattle is hazardous and causes traffic snarls. It affects the safety of human beings on roads. Besides, it depicts a dismal picture of the capital city.""

Directing shifting of all the dairies, including 2,655 functioning illegally, out of the city, it said, ""No effective steps are taken to prevent the cattle and the bovine animals from roaming on city roads.""

Also directing the capital''s two major milk suppliers -- Delhi Milk Scheme and Mother Dairy -- to increase their capacity to reach more consumers so that people did not fall back to illegal dairies, the Court said all the authorities should work together to tackle this problem.

Coming down heavily on authorised ''Gosadans''(cow sheds) for their ""mismanagement"" and the government for allowing illegal dairies with more than 30,000 animals to function, the Court said, ""MCD and NDMC shall cancel the licence of a dairy in case the cattle belonging to it stray out of its premises.""

""It appears the city government and its agencies are impervious to the menace and this has affected the quality of life of the citizen,"" the Court observed.

The Court said while impounding and transporting the animals care should be taken that they were not treated with cruelty.

13,Inflation inches up to 3.22 pc,"NEW DELHI: Even a whopping 13 per cent dip in vegetable prices could not hold down price level as inflation rose to 3.22 per cent for the week ended December 22.

The point-to-point price change, as measured by Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rose by 0.07 per cent from 3.15 per cent of the previous week due to pull up effect of manufactured items, which are the heaviest in the WPI basket. The index was only 2.08 per cent a year ago.

The index for Textiles'' group became costlier by 0.2 per cent to 123.6 due to higher prices of hessian and sacking bags (four per cent) and cotton yarn-hanks and hessian cloth (two per cent).

However, there was a seven per cent fall in the price of texturised yarn and one per cent in acrylic yarn.

Non-Metallic Mineral Products'' group index rose by 0.1 per cent to 145 on account of marginal increase in the price of cement.

14,UP BJP dissident leader returns to party fold,"LUCKNOW: Marking a virtual end to the dissidence in the Uttar Pradesh unit of BJP, leader of the rebel legislators Ganga Bhakt Singh returned to the party fold on Sunday.

""We have no complaints now,"" Singh said at a press conference, apparently as the state and the central BJP leadership has assured them that they would look into the issues raised by the dissidents.

He said UP BJP chief Vinay Katiyar and senior BJP leader Lalji Tandon have taken steps to redress the grievances of the party legislators over regional imbalance in the cabinet expansion a few months back, government apathy towards party legislators and indifferent attitude of the officials.

Stating that he had never left the BJP, Singh said his campaign was ""only to strengthen the party and it would not be correct to call me a rebel.""

Asked what prompted his return to the party fold when the campaign against the dissident legislators was continuing and several MLAs were in jail, he said the cases against the rebel legislators would be withdrawn and their persecution would also stop.

Tandon said he was happy at Singh''s return to the party fold. ""Singh has shown magnanimity by forgiving me for the mistakes committed unknowingly by me,"" he said and assured that Singh would be accorded due respect in the party.

Admitting that the cabinet expansion was carried out in a hurry, giving rise to resentment in some quarters, he indicated that another expansion might take place in the near future.

Asked whether Singh would be inducted in the ministry, Tandon, evading a direct reply, said ""The matter would be resolved through mutual consultations.""

15,Parliament should enact law for construction of temple: VHP,"BHUBANESWAR: It is time for major political parties to agree to enact a law in Parliament to pave the way for construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, VHP''s International General Secretary Praveen Bhai Tagodia said on Sunday.

""The BJP had supported the cause of the Ram temple in the past, but its stand on this issue is not clear today. We appeal to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to extend her party''s cooperation in this regard,"" Togadia told a press conference here.

""If the two major parties -- Congress and BJP -- support this cause, the Ram temple would not be an electoral issue and the matter would be resolved permanently,"" he said.

Asserting that the efforts to turn India into a Hindu Rashtra would succeed, the VHP leader said, ""I am not against the court deciding the Ram temple issue but I am of the opinion that the judiciary cannot decide matters relating to faith.""

Enactment of a legislation in Parliament will be a legal, democratic and civilised way of resolving the issue, he added.

Togadia said the Dharma Sansad will meet at Delhi from February 22 to 24 next to discuss the matter.

Though the Congress has been trying to appease the minority Muslims, the party has also shown sympathy towards Hindu sentiments in the past, he said. The party was in power when the temple lock was opened, the Rath Yatra was allowed and the construction of a temporary shrine was permitted where the disputed structure stood, Togadia said.

16,Govt rules out state-wise VAT,"KOLKATA: While city traders on Sunday sought the introduction of the Value Added Tax structure on the basis of the statesâ€™ demand, the West Bengal government made it clear that the basic features of VAT would be the same throughout the country.

VAT is proposed to be introduced primarily in replacement of the existing sales tax in many states from April 2003.

On Sunday, at a seminar titled ""Is the environment in West Bengal trade-friendly,"" Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations president Feroze H. Ali said that an ""illogical fiscal burden was being thrust upon distributive trade"".

""The burden restricts trade volumes, segments markets, creates regional imbalances and induces evasion, leading to revenue losses while promoting corruption amongst tax collectors,"" he remarked.

Ali was evasive on the question if the state was trade friendly. Criticising the government both at the Centre and the state, Ali said the main reason for the dismal fiscal situation of the country was the burden of salaries, pensions and interest payments, which he felt, ""eat up almost 75 per cent of the revenue"".

The confederation had demanded input tax credit for raw materials , spare parts, machinery and equipment, besides abolition of taxation of inter-state sales and withdrawal of way-bill system. Ali suggested that each state should have its own VAT system whose rates could be determined to make the tax revenue neutral.

Commissioner of state directorate of commercial taxes C.M. Bachawat said that the proposed VAT structure has been evolved on the basis of a consensus among the states. ""The basic features of VAT will therefore be same throughout the country,"" he said.

Bachawat assured that VAT would eliminate the cascading effect of the existing sales tax system by setting off the tax paid earlier at every stage of sale. He said that VAT would boost trade.

17,Panchayat polls in May: Chief Minister,"KOLKATA: Panchayat elections in West Bengal will be held in May, announced chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Kolkata on Sunday.

He was inaugurating an international seminar on local governance in India and China : Rural Development and Social Change.

He also announced that a new model of participative micro-planning â€” Gram Sansad, will be introduced in all the blocks of West Bengal by the end of 2004. ""This will be an extended form of the Gram Sabha. The model is being tried out in 40 blocks and will be in place by the end of 2004. All the voters will participate in discussions in the Gram Sansad,"" Bhattacharjee said.

The seminar has been organised by the Institute of Social Sci-ences, Delhi, with assistance from the Institute of Chinese Studies, Delhi, Center for Chinese Studies, University of California, Los Angeles and the Institute of Sociology, Peking University, Beijing. Apart from a number of participants from various states in India, there will also be a number of experts from the US and China.

The main objective of the seminar will be a comparative study between the models adopted by India and China. Among the others present during the inauguration were Richard Baum from UCLA and Ma Rong from Beijing.

Manoranjan Mohanty from the Institute of Chinese Studies explained the difference between local governments in China in India. ""While local governments in China concentrates to the growth of resources and raising peopleâ€™s income, in India, their main aim is to manage resources available with them,"" he said.

Elections for local bodies were held in China for the first time in 1998. The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments led to significant developments in local governance in India in the last decade.

According to Mohanty, there are two ways of looking at the local bodies. ""From one angle, they are agencies for the implementation of Central policies. While looking at them differently, they are also bodies providing local democracy,"" he said.

Bhattacharjee claimed that rural poverty in West Bengal had come down to 31.85 per cent in 1999 2000 from 73.16 per cent in 1973 - 74. ""Decentralisation â€” both of power and resources, holds the key to development. During Left Front rule, we have ensured that at least 70 per cent of rural land now belongs to the poor and downtrodden,"" he said.
