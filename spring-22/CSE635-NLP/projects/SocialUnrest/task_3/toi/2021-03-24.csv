0,2 Karnataka ministers get poll panel notice,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has issued show-cause notice to two Karnataka ministers and a state government functionary with cabinet rank for violating the model code of conduct.

EC spokesperson A.N. Jha told reporters on Tuesday that the three had made promises, including provision of drinking water, to the people after the announcement of the election dates.

The EC has sent the notice to the Karnataka chief secretary asking why B.S. Patil, special representative of the state in New Delhi, B.K. Chandrashekar, minister of state for primary and secondary education, and R. Ramalinga Reddy, minister for Bangalore city development, did not follow the model code of conduct.

Jha said the three had been given two days to explain. Jha said specific complaints of personal attacks on politicians are being examined. Asked about the ECâ€™s powers to control such attacks, Jha shot back: â€œWait and see. There are ample provisions within the law.â€™â€™ Repeated queries yielded the same response.

Jha admitted that cross-complaints have been received from the DMK and the AIADMK alleging personal attacks on their leaders. The EC is seeking the opinion of both parties.

However, it is believed the EC is likely to frame a set of guidelines specifically aimed at controlling personal attacks. It is even considering a proposal to disqualify leaders making personal attacks from contesting.

On the alleged sale of social security forms from the BJP office in Mumbai, Jha said the Maharashtra chief electoral officer had collected facts and would be sending his report soon. Even the labour secretary had been asked to give his comments by Wednesday.

The EC, he said, had been meeting officials of the defence ministry and the Andhra Pradesh, Tripura, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Manipur governments to facilitate airlifting of poll parties which would have to be in place before the first phase of elections. The EC had decided that polling would be held from 7 am to 5 pm. The timing would be the same throughout the country. Chandrashekar B.S. Patil R.R. Reddy

1,"Bangarappa’s moves upset party, Parivar","SHIMOGA: It appears that the BJP has bitten off more than it can chew. Bangarappaâ€™s hop-over from the Congress to the BJP has set off cataclysmic changes, both for the party as well as in his family circle.

And it all began with the BJP giving Bangarappa complete freedom with the choice of tickets for Shimoga district, his fiefdom.

For one, his son and heir-apparent Kumar Bangarappa is, apparently, no longer the favoured heir. Though he followed his father meekly out of the Congress, the Soraba ticket went to Madhu Bangarappa. But the cine star, who has been shocked incommunicado by his fatherâ€™s fell swoop, could now upset the applecart.

The Congress is already reconsidering his expulsion. His followers, meanwhile, refuse to support or campaign for Madhu. Committed workers at Soraba and Bhadravathi are opposed to the party candidate, setting off worry in the BJP. Kumar Swami, BJP district vice-president, said this could lead to rebel candidates rearing their heads.

Bangarappa has also kept all the tickets in the family â€” his sisterâ€™s son Halappa is contesting from Hosanagar, another kin Gopalkrishna has been named from Sagar, and close follower Manjunath has been fielded from Bhadravathi. That all of them are residents of Bangalore, and have no locus standi in Shimoga, could go against them in the final picture.

This has enraged loyal BJP workers. Dumbfounded BJP leaders say this could have a negative impact on the partyâ€™s performance.

The Congress, meanwhile, is watching the developments coolly. The party leaders feel Bangarappaâ€™s selection will help the Congress romp home. None of the senior district leaders have followed Bangarappa, they point out. According to Azeez Ahmed, DCC president and Narayanappa, former MLA and Bangarappaâ€™s brother-in-law, his decisions have been careless.

But none of this affects Bangarappa, who has been holding a special conclave at Soraba, to regroup his followers.

Community leaders of the Edigas, Lingayats, Brahmins and minorities are holding meetings to decide on who to support. Most of them say Bangarappa is playing a risky game, and could well lead to his own downfall.

The CBI has made the request to the supreme court, requesting that since it has shortage of manpower, it would need the infrastructure and logistical support of local teams, Thakare said, while reading the order.

4,Colvin crisis and clash of interests,"LUCKNOW: While students and alumni of Colvin Taluqdarsâ€™ College are desperate to revive the institution, secondary teachers association along with government and Colvin Management Committee it seems are interested in the â€˜possessionâ€™ of the 80 acre of the college land.

This was witnessed on Tuesday, when teachers association leaders and management committee members entered into verbal duel in front of the state education minister Manpal Singh during a meeting called by government to solve the Colvin crisis. â€œThe two parties traded charges, hurled expletives and nearly fell short of exchanging blows,â€� commented an officer after coming out of the meeting.

The government had formed a committee last year comprising teachers association leaders and college management committee to look into the possibilities of the revival of the Colvin. The committee has met several times since then and on Tuesday an emergency meeting was called. Trouble began when a proposal came from an officer in the secondary education department that government plans to take over the college land and construct â€˜education directorateâ€™ along with an â€˜adarsh vidyalayaâ€™.

Colvin management committee members, represented by manager Rakesh Pratap Singh, Mayenkeshwar Singh and KK Singh reacted sharply and accused the government and the teachers association leaders of conspiring to take over the land for a different purpose than education. â€œTill date the contention of the secondary teachers association leaders was that the teachers of the UP Board wing should be reinstated after closure and college should be given grant-in aid, however, today their stand changed,â€� Rakesh Pratap Singh later told reporters.

Teachers, represented by MLCs Om Prakash Sharma, Panchanan Rai, Devi Dayal Shastri and Raj Bahadur Singh Chandel, in turn charged management committee of trying to sell the land to set up a commercial establishment for monetary gains. The minister and the officers, which included principal secretary education Neera Yadav, quietly watched the proceedings go haywire. Uproarious scenes continued for over an hour before the meeting was deferred. Principal secretary was not available for comments.

5,EC meet parties on opinion and exit polls,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has convened an all-party meeting on April 6 to discuss exit and opinion polls conducted by newspapers and television.

Announcing this on Tuesday, EC spokesperson A N Jha, however, clarified that the Commission at this point was not contemplating approaching the SC to review its decision of 1999 restraining the poll panel from banning the exit and opinion polls. He said it would do what emerged as the consensus at the meeting.

Asked about the ECâ€™s opinion on the issue, Jha said it felt that such polls should be banned. Asked if the EC would ask one of the political parties or the I&B ministry to file a petition in the apex court, Jha said, â€˜â€˜We would see what is the consensus.â€™â€™ According to sources, the EC feels that since political parties, barring a few, are in favour of a ban, it would add weight to the Commissionâ€™s plea. The Commission stands a fair chance if the views of the political parties are also made part of the review petition.

8,"3,377 people barred from contesting polls","NEW DELHI: Itâ€™s the Election Commissionâ€™s gallery of the infamous â€” the names and addresses of 3,263 persons who have been disqualified from contesting assembly elections and 114 persons disqualified in respect of Lok Sabha elections.

The listâ€”a total of 3,377 peopleâ€”is as of March 1, 2004. The disqualification in most cases is for three years.

Their crime: Indulging in corrupt practices, failing to submit the accounts of poll expenses and being convicted under certain sections of the IPC which attract disqualification under the Representation of People Act, 1951.

They cannot contest election till the period of disqualification is over. Since the process of detecting malpractices takes time, the disqualification is effective from the date the EC gave the order.

Uttar Pradesh, with the maximum number of parliamentary and assembly constituencies, tops the list. The EC has disqualified 1,452 persons who contested the last assembly elections and 16 who were in the fray during the 1999 parliamentary polls. Tamil Nadu occupies the second spot with 307 assembly and 11 Lok Sabha contestants disqualified.

Bihar has done its reputation good with a mere 200 assembly contestants being disqualified. Its record for the last LS polls is also good â€” only six contestants being disqualified.

Haryana and Maharashtra have a poor record too. While the former saw disqualification of 154 assembly candidates, 12 LS candidates were punished. Maharashtra, on the other hand, saw disqualification of 129 assembly and 12 LS candidates.

Rajasthan, which topped the chart of disqualified candidates during the last LS polls with 23, has somehow managed to balance out with a paltry 24 being disqualified during the assembly polls.
