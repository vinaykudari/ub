0,Haryana govt decides to allot liquor vends through tenders,"chandigarh: under the new excise policy of the haryana government, liquor vends will be allotted through tenders and not auction as was the practice earlier. the excise policy for the year 2002-03 was approved by the state cabinet which met here on thursday under the chairmanship of chief minister om prakash chautala. the excise policy also aims at checking smuggling of liquor, keeping a strict vigil on quality and incentives to l-2 licensees and exporters of country liquor and indian made foreign spirit (imfs). the cabinet also decided to increase the total number of vends from 1,550 to 1,600, besides merging the licence fee of country liquor and indian made foreign liquor (imfl) in case the group has both country and imfl vends. keeping in view the health and environmental hazards, it was decided to stop the supply of liquor in pouches. the excise duty on country liquor has been reduced from rs 21 per proof litre to rs 11 per proof litre to minimise smuggling from neighbouring states. it was also decided not to enhance the quota of country liquor, which would remain 450 lakh proof litres. however, the quota of imfl would be reduced from 200 lakh proof litres to 180 lakh proof litres. the licence to sell beer would also be given to rural country liquor licensees at a fee of rs 1 lakh per vend. under the new policy, liquor vends in districts would be divided into groups and auction system would be replaced by tenders. these tenders would be invited after fixing the reserve price of each group.the reserve price would be based on last year''s revenue, that is licence fee, and decrease in revenue due to the proposed reduction in excise duty. besides, tenders would be invited for all groups simultaneously. the bidders will have to submit documentary evidence about their financial position, giving details of their assets, bank statements and properties. it was also decided that the earnest money under the tender system will be five per cent of the reserve price as compared to rs 2 lakh under auction system. officials feel that this decision would help in checking frivolous bidding. the new policy allows l-2 licensees to tie up in their areas with hotels and restaurants, having proper facilities of rooms and dining hall, and get l-4 or l-5 licence at a fee of rs 5 lakh per year. there will also be no excise duty on imported liquor. however, sales tax will be levied on such liquor at the rate of 20 per cent. with a view to maintaining a check on the quality of liquor, the cabinet also approved the proposal of the excise department to constitute a committee of officers to examine the request of new entrants desirous of marketing their products in haryana. this committee would look into the facilities at the distillery, reputation and quality of their products and the opinion of the licensees. fresh l1b licence would be granted on the recommendation of this committee.

8,Shrimp farms harming Sunderbans ecology,"kolkata: the asian development bank has identified the proliferation of shrimp farms in the sunderbans as the biggest threat to its environment. unless urgent measures are taken to remedy the situation, the bank apprehends a severe damage to the biodiversity of the area. these facts have come out in a report on a $450,000 technical assistance being given for a nine-month survey of the sunderbans for the development of an integrated conservation and development plan for the area. the survey is to be completed by september. ""the biggest threat to the aquatic ecosystem is the proliferation of shrimp farms. thousands of women and children collect wild tiger prawn spawn for sale to shrimp farms. in recent years, the catch of these tiger prawn spawn has been decreasing, signaling the concurrent decrease in other fish species. because the sunderbans are the aquaculture nursery for the bay of bengal, this decline could result in loss of livelihoods for thousands of families dependent on fishing,"" the bank report states. the adb is already financing a similar project for the development of the bangladesh part of the sunderbans, which, together with the indian part, comprise one of the three most extensive mangrove forests in the world. the diverse vegetation of the sunderbans forests includes about 36 mangrove species that provide a unique mix of habitats for wildlife, which includes turtles, terrapins, dolphins, estuarine crocodiles and several species of birds, many of which are migratory. thus, there is an urgent need to conserve its environment, the bank report felt. one of the main focus of the survey is to develop sustainable livelihoods for the residents of the area. ""they (the sunderbans) are considered one of the most backward regions in west bengal, and are home to about four million people, of whom 56 per cent are landless. literacy rates are below 35 per cent, most communities do not have electricity or safe drinking water, and agricultural productivity is lower than the state average. inadequate infrastructure, poor communication facilities, lack of access to clean drinking water and health and education services, and a fragile and limited natural resource base have contributed to a low level of development and high poverty incidence in the region,"" the report states. due to this high incidence of poverty, the population draws heavily on forest resources, severely damaging the biodiversity in the process. ""the extinction in recent times of several mammal species, including the javan rhinoceros, swamp deer, gaur and hog deer, signals the alarming trends in the decline of biodiversity in the sunderbans caused by increasing population pressures, poverty, and legal and illegal overharvesting of natural resources,"" the adb report states. it is in this regard that the survey proposes to develop alternative livelihoods for the residents to reduce their dependence on forest produce. it will identify investment needs and priorities for securing livelihoods of people in selected island and mainland communities. ""livelihoods activities will focus on (i) livelihoods analysis to study the assets, capabilities, and activities required for sustaining and securing livelihoods, and building on the strengths of the poor; (ii) a disaster management plan for the selected communities; (iii) pisciculture or mariculture to improve this key sector of local livelihoods and to modify the present environmentally destructive methods of shrimp farming; (iv) gender and equity to promote the participation of all sections of society and to ensure that benefits from interventions reach the poor and the disadvantaged; and (v) marketing and credit to increase income through value-addition, and remove delivery system inefficiencies,"" the report stated.

9,Big 3 skew state investment figures,"kolkata: if the nineties was a decade of hope and dreams for west bengal''s industry, the next 10 years could well be one of fulfillment. at least, that''s what the actual investments in the first year of the millennium suggests. according to the industry ministry, there was an investment of rs 2,195 crore in 2001 against an average annual investment of rs 1,704 crores in the ''90s which included the big three projects - haldia petrochemicals, modernisation of the durgapur steel plant and the mitsubishi chemicals'' pta project. ""these three projects, with an investment of rs 11,262 crore, projected a skewed picture of a none-too impressive performance. attend any interface between the government and the chambers and you''ll hear ministers rattling the three names. they are just obsessed with these projects,"" alleges an industrialist. what he says is perhaps true. investment figures of 1994 and 2000, the two big years in which these projects were completed, would indeed lose their sheen if these investments are removed. only rs 339 crore would show against 1994 instead of rs 4,832 crore. and rs 970 would show against 2000 instead of rs 7,740 crore. three projects apart, other than 1999 when rs 1,872 crore worth projects were completed, the decade from 1991 to 2000 would average only rs 500 crore worth investments per year. ""that''s paltry,"" say critics. senior bureaucrats in the industry ministry admit the state''s performance was rather poor during the mou years between 1994 and 1998 when investment averaged rs 470 crore a year. ""but, there''s been a dramatic improvement in the investments between 1998 and 2000 with the average shooting up to rs 1421 crore,"" said commerce and industry department principal secretary jawhar sircar. ""no one''s saying that all''s hunky-dory about the state. there''s lots that remains to be done. however, perception should not dampen spirits and spoil the state''s image despite a whole-hearted effort at becoming a front-runner after a late start,"" sircar added. the official shows how 2001 has been an even better year in terms of investment. projects worth rs 2,194.54 crore were completed during the year. of this, rs 597 crore was invested by central public sector undertakings and the rest by private/joint sector. the investment figure though includes a dozen projects worth rs 256 crore implemented in 2000 but reported in 2001 by the individual units. government officials attribute the improved performance in 2001 to constant monitoring and pro-active steps to remove hurdles for industries. ""the year''s performance should be viewed in the context of the ongoing recession. in any case, it is better than the last decade,"" remarks a leading financial analyst.

10,Lending a tinge of glamour to mundane politics,"lucknow: a ''rani'' and a ''rebel'', two mighty women candidates, have not only added glamour to the assembly polls in the parliamentary constituency of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee- lucknow - they are also making the bharatiya janata party candidates sweat more in their respective segments. while suneeta singh, the niece of former prime minister and raja manda vp singh is giving sleepless night to sitting mla and bjp candidate gomti yadav in mahona, kusum rai the power centre during kalyan singh regime, is giving nightmares to bjp candidate suresh srivastava in lucknow central. the bjp has roped in prime minister atal behari vajpayee to counter the glamour of both the ladies. he would address three public meetings in his lok sabha constituency on friday. though both the ladies come from political families, but its their maiden attempt to enter the assembly. interestingly, both rebelled against the family''s political lineage and joined opposite camps. kusum dumped rashtriya swayamsevak sangh to join kalyan singh''s rashtriya kranti party (rkp) while suneeta preferred congress to lok morcha, his uncle vp singh''s front. but both are a study in contrast. if suneeta has royal lineage, kusum hails from a lower middle class family. both have weird tastes too. if suneeta''s favourite colour is lemon and peach then kusum prefers red and maroon. the corporator''s penchant for best perfumes is well knownm while suneeta claims that she never wears any perfumes. if neo-rich rai likes to adorn heavy jewellery, suneeta hardly opens family ''khazana''. but there are striking similarities too. development is their main issue and both prefer personal contact rather than indulging in poster-banner war. the bjp is their number one enemy. ""being a woman, we certainly have an edge over our male counterparts. women voters feel more comfortable and every one listens to us respectfully,"" chirps suneeta. and in the difficult task of taking up the bjp might in the prime minister''s lok sabha constituency, they are not alone. both are helped by their hubbies â€” rajesh rai and deveshwar narain singh of baskin robbins fame respectively. suneeta''s 16-year-old son deependra narain singh, a class 11th student of welhem boys, is also helping his mother in her campaign. not lagging behind, rai has a strong posse of supporters. a retired dgp, a few senior bureaucrats and even a few criminals, who once had splurged her largess, are helping her clandestinely by providing money and muscle power. both start their campaigns early and return late and chose areas where people are annoyed with the bjp. suneeta''s convoy comprising swanky cars moves to narendi in chinhat where people have announced to boycott polls. road nahi to vote nahi. she asks them not to commit the same mistake again. ""vote for me and i promise to develop the area like a model constituency. kusum also harps on anti-bjp sentiments. ""i have made rajajipuram a model corporation area. i would make this assembly area another rajajipuram, if elected."" she uses the other language after entering into saffron-dominated areas. ""i am contesting from here to ensure the defeat of the bjp candidate. my victory would come from dildarnagar in gazipur district (the other assembly constituency from where she is in fray). ironically, she cleverly tells the same to the voters of dildarnagar.

12,Delay in APERC nod for project worries govt,"hyderabad: even as the daily power consumption requirement is expected to shoot up further in view of the forthcoming summer season, the government is worried over the delay in clearance for the bses andhra power project from the andhra pradesh electricity regulatory commission (aperc). a group of companies including tata have set up power projects at peddapuram in east godavari district to generate 220 mw of power. this is the first among the naphta-based projects later converted to gas with a reduction in the fixed cost by over 25 per cent. the bses has promised to produce power at the rate of rs 1.80 per kv hour, said to be lowest independent power producer in the country in the similar category. in fact the bses had reduced the fixed cost by over 25 per cent after a hard bargaining by the government. the unit is ready for generation of power and is awaiting for clearance from the aperc. however, the commission which completed the public hearings on the project had not given its approval so far, seriously jeopardising the prospects of the power producer. the commission, it is said, raised some technical doubts about the allocation of gas. the officials, worried over the delay in clearing the project, say that with the onset of rabi season and due to increase in agricultural demand, the daily requirement of power had already reached 142 million units per day. â€œthere is no great wisdom in keeping the power project in waiting and going for purchasing of power from the other states,â€™â€™ an official said. the commission wanted the bses to show firm allocation of gas, which it is said, was not the job of the commission. the delay by the commission to clear the project has reportedly raised doubts in the minds of other producers who want to set up their units in the state.
