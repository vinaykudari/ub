0,BJP youth wing to launch stir against state govt,"PATNA: The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) will launch a statewide agitation from February 10 to 18 in protest against the state governmentâ€™s failure to spend Central funds meant for several development schemes and siphoning of these funds.

The BJYM workers will lock up all the block offices and will ask for the accounts of all these development schemes. This was decided here on Thursday at a meeting of the BJYM state office-bearers. Addressing the meeting, BJP state president Nand Kishore Yadav called upon the BJYM workers and also the young generation to come forward for the development of the state cutting across caste barriers. He said that the loot of Central funds meant for development must be checked.

BJYM leader Harendra Pratap, in his speech on the occasion, said that this movement should be so strong and powerful that it leaves an imprint on the minds of all the corrupt officials who are behind this loot.

Meanwhile, BJYM state secretary Om Prakash Bhuvan has said that education minister Ramchandra Purveyâ€™s claim that government was not responsible for what the private publishers has written about Rajputs in the book, Sugam Bharatiya Itihaash, had exposed the government as the private publisher has said that in reality the said statement on Rajputs has been taken from the state government owned Bihar State Text Book Corporationâ€™s book titled, Madhya Bharat, which is in publication since 1993 itself and is also being taught. He also criticised a section of the Congress and BPP leaders who are trying their best to gain the sympathy of the Rajput community. It is they who are the real culprits and are supporting the movement launched in protest against the rewriting of history books, said Bhuvan.

1,Test-tube babies may suffer genetic flaw: Study,"PARIS: Babies born through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) may be prey to a rare genetic disorder, according to a study whose findings underscore the health perils from human cloning.

British researchers looked at the background of 149 babies with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an inherited condition which causes excessive growth, low blood sugar, defects in the abdominal wall and kidney abnormalities. Only about one per cent of the general population has the disorder.

But six of the 149 afflicted- four per cent- were born from IVF, the researchers said.

Three were born to the standard IVF method, in which an egg is fertilised by sperm in a lab dish, and the others to a technique called in tracytoplasmic injection (ICSI), in which sperm is directly injected in the egg.

The scientists, from the universities of Birmingham and Cambridge, believe IVF disrupts imprinting which is a process that occurs at the earliest stages of conception.

An embryo is a combination of a set of genes from its mother and a set of genes from its father. Under imprinting, the activity of specific genes, from either the paternal or the maternal side, is muted during foetal development. This way, there is no clash of competing genes, and the embryo develops normally.

""The genes themselves are not necessarily any different but imprinting controls how active the gene is,"" said Wolf Reik, a co-author of the study released on Thursday who works at the Brabaham Institute in Cambridge.",PARIS
2,Shinde stakes claim to form govt,"MUMBAI: The newly-elected head of the Democratic Front (DF) coalition and chief minister designate Sushil Kumar Shinde on Friday met Maharashtra Governor Mohammed Fazal and staked claim for the formation of the new government.

Shinde submitted a list of supporters, with the signatures of 148 MLAs.

The list excluded five PWP MLAs who have decided to remain neutral and two CPM MLAs, who have agreed to only support the DF government from outside.

Fazal has given 15 days time to Shinde to prove his majority on the floor of the House.

Shinde, who succeeds Vilasrao Deshmukh, will be sworn-in as chief minister tomorrow at 4 pm.

He was elected as head of the DF coalition at a meeting of DF legislators at Vidhan Bhavan on Friday morning.

The 289-member Maharashtra Assembly has 74 Congress MLAs, 56-NCP, 69-Sena and 12 Independents. There are five PWP members, one-JD (S), two-CPM, three-BBM (B), one-RPI (Gavai) and three members of other smaller parties besides one nominated member in the state Assembly.

Six of the members of the House had been suspended by the Assembly Speaker minutes before the June 13 crucial vote of confidence against the Deshmukh ministry for switching loyalties.

3,"Raje, Bharti may relinquish office for party work","NEW DELHI: With Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan Assembly polls slated for later this year, Union Ministers Vasundhara Raje and Uma Bharti appear certain to relinquish office soon to concentrate full time on leading the BJP charge in the two states.

BJP sources said Raje and Bharti have not expressed any desire to remain in the ministry and are likely to move out by this month-end.

Raje, appointed as Rajasthan party unit chief, has already started touring the state as also Bharti who will be spearheading the BJP campaign in MP.

But Raje''s continuance in the ministry has given rise to murmurs of discontent within the party''s state unit and the party central leadership would like her to take full charge of the state as early as possible, the sources said.

Since veteran BJP leader Bhairon Singh Shekhawat''s taking over as vice-president, the party has projected Raje as its chief ministerial candidate.

In MP, the BJP central leadership is keen that Bharti takes the plunge headlong into the state politics and the preparations for the Assembly polls in order to counter high-profile Chief Minister Digvijay Singh''s recent stepped-up campaign to woo Dalit votes. Bharti herself belongs to OBC community.

4,Remove hoardings extolling achievements: EC to HP govt,"SHIMLA: The Election Commission on Friday directed the Himachal Pradesh government to immediately remove hoardings put up at various places highlighting its achievements after the code of conduct for the February''s Assembly elections came into force from January 11.

On receipt of the EC''s direction, the state government instructed all deputy commissioners and other concerned officers and managing directors of corporations to remove all such hoardings, an official spokesman said here.

In a communication to the state government, the EC said complaints have been received regarding the hoardings extolling the achievements of the government and displaying comparative statistics with that of the previous governments.

""The commission has carefully examined the issue and feels that there is sufficient merit in the complaints... Publicity hoardings of these types, set up at government cost, do just that, namely, give an unfair advantage to the party in power at the cost of public exchequer,"" it said and directed that such hoardings should be taken out immediately.

Meanwhile, Chief Electoral Officer Manisha Nanda directed that the candidates, their supporters and political parties during the campaign should not deface public and private property by pasting posters and writing slogans.

She asked district electoral officers to enforce these directions and take stern action against the defaulters.

5,Four castes for inclusion in OBC list,"LUCKNOW: Four more castes, namely Savant, Katuwa, Herupi and Barai or Tamoli, have separately represented before the National Backward Commission for their inclusion in the scheduled list of backward classes on the basis of prevailing social condition.

The commission, which was here in connection with the hearing of their representation, however, has reserved its decision on the issue. ""We want to take a judicious decision after considering various facts about people of these castes and we will announce the decision shortly,"" said chairman of the commission Justice Ram Surat Singh here on Friday.

Braving bone-chilling cold, people belonging to these castes had turned out here in a large number from far-flung areas to put up their view points before the commission, which gave them a patient hearing for over four hours. The response of the people were encouraging and still there was a need to create more awakening among the people of backward classes to demand their right for inclusion in the OBC list, observed Justice Singh.

Present on the occasion was also member of the Central commission Neera Shastri, who pleaded that the commission should be given more power under the amendments in the existing Act pending before the consideration of the parliament.

Underlining the need for uniformity in the caste identification, he said the Central commission had included only 74 castes under the category of the OBC as compared to that of 79 castes listed by its counterpart in UP. The result of it was that a candidate, who was allowed to get reservation benefit in the state for the Provincial Civil Services (PCS), would be deprived from the same for the Centreâ€™s premier services of the IAS, IPS and others.

""One becomes qualified for the reservation benefit for the Central services only when the caste which he belongs to is listed as OBC with the Central commission,"" Justice Singh said, adding that people should not think that it was done automatically once they were registered as OBC in the state. The procedure for it was simple, he said adding that for this, the backward people needed to put up their written representation for consideration of the Central commission.

Regarding variations in the record of the Central and state commissions, he said it should be avoided by evolving uniformity countrywide. For instance, he said Jats, who had been brought under the purview of reservation in UP did not figure in the list of the Central commission.

This was because of the fact that Jat representatives had not put up their case before the commission and this according to him was true for few other castes, which had been left out by the Central commission.

As NS Chaurasia, a High Court lawyer puts it: ""Chaurasia, which was a sub-name of caste Barai is also not included in the Central list of OBC."" The caste Barai, according to him is of those engaged in the work of betel cultivation.

But now people, who have joined government job, have preferred to be called Chaurasia and those in the profession as Tamoli. But since the correction has not been effected in the record, they have been denied the reservation benefit for the central services. The case was put up before the commission, he said.
