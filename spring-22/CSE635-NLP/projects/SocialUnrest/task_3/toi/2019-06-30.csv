1,Kanchi seer flays govt for allowing FDI in print,"MUMBAI: The Shankaracharya of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham Sri Jayendra Saraswati has criticised the Union governmentâ€™s decision to permit 26 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the print media.

Talking to this correspondent here on Friday, he said that â€˜â€˜there was no compulsion for the government to take this decision.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜I can understand if the economy is opened up because of the compulsions of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). But the print media has nothing to do with GATT. The government has unnecessarily opened a Pandoraâ€™s box by its decision,â€™â€™ he stated.

â€˜â€˜It is unfortunate that the present government in New Delhi, which had professed its commitment to Indian values, is permitting foreign capital in the Indian newspaper industry,â€™â€™ he said.

â€˜â€˜I took up the matter with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and he said that he was bound by the compulsions of coalition politics. In fact, whenever I take up an issue with him, he says there is not much he can do since he is heading a large coalition government,â€™â€™ he said.

The Acharya said: â€˜â€˜The entry of foreign interests pose a danger to Indiaâ€™s culture and moral values.â€™â€™

He noted that most Indian newspapers had played a crucial role during the Independence movement. In his opinion, the cap of 26 per cent meant nothing since even with a minority share, a foreign investor could manage to influence an Indian newspaperâ€™s editorial policy.

The talk of granting permission to foreign investors on a case-by-case basis also amounted to nothing because ultimately â€˜â€˜all kinds of foreign investors with their own agendasâ€™â€™ would enter the media market, he said.

It would be impossible for the government to do a background check of the foreign investors, he said adding that the governments hostile to India could â€˜â€˜float dummy companies and try to enter the Indian print industry.â€™â€™

India, he said, should learn a lesson from the governmentâ€™s decision to permit foreign players in the electronic media. â€˜â€˜What is Fashion TV doing if not corrupting our culture?â€™â€™ he asked.

The spiritual leader said the print media could not be treated like any other industry. It was an unique industry with its own sensitivities.

Opposing the Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s demand for carving up Jammu and Kashmir state, the Acharya said it would not be in the national interest to do so.

â€˜â€˜Our effort should be to bring back all Kashmiris who have left the state and ensure their welfare. Under no circumstances should Article 370, which confers a special status to J&K be abrogated,â€™â€™ he said.

2,People want Priyanka to enter politics: Jogi,"NEW DELHI: Chattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi said on Sunday people of the nation wanted Prinyanka Gandhi to enter politics to serve and strengthen Congress organisation.

After meeting Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday evening, Jogi said that ""people look at her (Priyanka) as grand daughter of Indira Gandhi. They would want her to serve the party and help it grow stronger.""

Jogi said he met Sonia to congragulate her on Priynaka becoming a mother again. ""My wife and I went to congratulate Sonia ji.""

Asked if he discussed the prospects of elections likely to be held in 10 states, including Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, next year, he said ""I am not going to tell you what we discussed.""

On whether he wanted Priyanka to be the star campaigner for Congress in the next round of state Assembly elections, Jogi said, ""This is for her to decide. People want every member of Gandhi-Nehru family but it is always they (family members) who decide whether or not to enter political arena.""

At the same time Jogi exuded confidence that Congress would sweep the elections in all the states that would go to polls next year on its own strength.

On his own state, Jogi said, ""People will return us if we have given them good governance... By and large party fights the elections on its own and only in certain cases it can join others to defeat communal forces.""

3,US asks Hurriyat to participate in J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: The Hurriyat Conference is believed to be under pressure from western countries including the United States to participate in the coming elections in Jammu and Kashmir.

Recently, an American delegation met Hurriyat Conference leaders including its chairman Abdul Gani Bhat and had an interaction with him during which various issues including participation in the forthcoming polls were discussed.

Sources in the conglomerate said Bhat was in for a shock when the American delegation led by Steve Sobto conveyed that the United States did not recognise any organisation which ran away from a democratic exercise.

Bhat''s attempt to justify their non-participation in the elections was countered by the delegation which made it emphatically clear that the Hurriyat Conference should prove its representative character, the sources said.

The amalgam has been receiving similar indications from other western countries including the European Union and Britain.

The delegation''s talks with senior leaders have left the second rung Hurriyat men ""disheartened"", who view these as indicative of depletion of support to the amalgam.

The US delegation also met Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front Vice-President Javed Ahmed Mir and Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and conveyed similar views to both of them, the sources said.

The Hurriyat Conference''s move of forming their own election commission has failed to rouse any keen interest in international community.

8,Vajpayee should lead party in 2004 polls: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Home Minister L K Advani on Sunday said his elevation as Deputy Prime Minister should not be seen as a move to succeed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who he stated should lead the party in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

""The move should not be seen as paving the way for a successor to Vajpayee as both of us are of the same age group,"" Advani said.

He said in the BJP, Vajpayee, Khushabhau Thakre and myself are all over the age of 70 years. And any question of a successor would have to fall on a younger leader.

Advani said it was the party''s view that Vajpayee should lead the BJP in the next general elections.

""My view on this is firm and I believe that he (Vajpayee) will abide by it"", Advani said.

Advani said he felt the appointment might have been made with a view to dispelling any rumours in the media about differences with the Prime Minister.

Asked whether his appointment will find favour with NDA allies given his hardline image, he said he had been working with the allies for over four years.

""I have been accepted by them and no new situation will arise as a result of this appointment"", he asserted.

On the issue of BJP agenda, he said the government was that of NDA and not of BJP. Therefore, a Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of NDA would be followed and implemented.

""We have honestly followed CMP for four years. This has nothing to do with my appointment as Deputy Prime Minister"", he said.

He further said his appointment had been made after due consultation with the allies.

10,E-governance plan aims to cut red tape in govt,"BANGALORE: To ensure speedy decision-making and cut the red-tape out of administration, the state government is in the process of formulating a governance-strategy action plan which, among other things, envisages the setting up of a file-monitoring system for the bureaucracy.

From simplifying rules and procedures in day-to-day administration in all government departments to use of computers and e-mail for all official transactions, the plan aims at making the government delivery system more focussed and target-oriented.

A sum of Rs 5 crore has been earmarked for e-governance in administration in the state budget for 2002-2003.

Official sources told The Times of India that the action plan would be completed by August. ``We want to usher in e-governance specially in people-oriented departments like transport, rural development and municipal administration. The idea is to ensure speedy-decision making,'''' they said.

The action plan envisages establishing a file monitoring system which will enable secretaries of all departments to monitor the movement of files in their departments. ``Every bureaucrat must know the status and reasons for the pendency of each file. This system will bring in accountability too besides enabling senior officials to take action against delay in clearing files,'''' sources pointed out.

At present, all secretaries are networked and the entire government secretariat in Vidhana Soudha is connected by the Local Area Network (LAN).

Yet another important feature of the action plan is to fix the number of persons that each file goes through, before it is cleared for implementation. ``At present, there are so many levels before a file actually gets cleared that it is cumbersome. Once the plan is implemented, every file will go through three levels only,'''' sources said.

As a first step, the chief secretary''s office has directed all government departments located in Vidhana Soudha to cut down on files and clear pending files. The departments have been told to close old files or transfer the necessary files to the computer for easy accessibility.

The government''s decision to have an action plan for governance comes in the wake of Chief Minister S.M. Krishna warning the bureaucracy to shed ``arm-chair'''' governance and take projects to the people, sources said.

RAVINDRA ON THE JOB

Chief Secretary A. Ravindra has set the trend for e-governance in day-to-day administration. He uses only e-mail to sanction or cancel leave, tours and other routine matters for bureaucrats and other secretaries. There is absolutely no paper transaction. The chief secretary''s office checks the mail everyday and clears it on his instructions.

11,V-C selection norms to be announced today,"PATIALA: The three-member search committee set up recently by the Punjab government for the selection of the new Vice-Chancellor of Punjabi University will be meeting for the first time at Chandigarh on Monday.

The government has also replaced committee member GS Kalkat, who served as V-C of Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana, with Dr Jaswant Singh Neki, a noted scholar from Delhi. Kalkat is not presently in the country.

Other two committee members are former Punjabi University V-C Dr HK Manmohan Singh and former Panjab University V-C Dr RP Bambha. HK Manmohan Singh told Times News Network that parameters and criterion for the selection of the V-C would be fixed at the meeting. Asked what should the basic qualifications of the VC be, he opined that the new V-C should be a visionary. The job, he said, was full of stress which was why the new incumbent must be able to deal with intense pressure.

â€˜â€˜No doubt, he or she should be an outstanding educationist, but as far as the university is concerned, the appointee must be able to discharge the statutory obligation of promoting Punjabi studies and Punjabi as a language,â€™â€™ he added. Clarifying that these were his personal views, HK Manmohan Singh said that the criteria would be fixed by the search committee.

Interestingly, nearly 20 persons have submitted their curriculum vitae (CV) for the post. However, according to highly placed sources, these applicants are nowhere on the priority list of the committee. Former Punjabi University V-C Sardara Singh Johl, who at present is among the close advisors of the Punjab chief minister, had already said that those who have submitted their CVs should not be considered for the post.

12,Ex-minister's daughter-in-law gets bail in fraud case,"FARIDKOT: The Faridkot district and sessions judge on Saturday granted conditional anticipatory bail to Paramjit Kaur, daughter-inlaw of senior SAD leader and former Punjab agriculture minister Gurdev Singh Badal, in a case of cheating and fraud.

The accused has been restrained from leaving India without prior permission of the court and has been asked to be present before the police officials when required. Following a complaint by Rajbir Singh, a sacked police constable, the district police had registered a case of cheating under Sections 420 and 34 of the IPC against Paramjit Kaur and three others on May 30.

Rajbir Singh, a resident of Bhan Singh Colony of Faridkot town, was dismissed from service two years ago for remaining absent from duty for a long period due to serious injury in a road accident. It had been alleged by the complainant that SAD workers Raj Singh, Dilbag Singh and Darshan Singh had promised to get him re-instated through the then agriculture minister on payment of Rs 1.5 lakh. While Rs 50,000 were allegedly paid to Paramjit Kaur on March 30, 2001 at Gurdev Badalâ€™s residence at Faridkot, the remaining amount was paid at the official residence of the minister in Chandigarh.

The complainant alleged that he was never reinstated as promised, rather Paramjit Kaur threatened him with dire consequences when he demanded the money back. DSP, 3 policemen yet to be arrested: A DSP and three junior police officials, against whom a case of corruption was registered nearly two weeks ago, have not yet been arrested.

While the police authorities maintain that teams have been dispatched to arrest the accused, the complainants on the other hand allege that the police is buying time for their colleagues to enable them to secure anticipatory bail before arrest. DSP Bhupinder Singh Khatra, SHO Major Singh, ASIs Balbir Singh and Rajbir Singh had been booked by the district police under various sections of the IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act.

The case had been registered after an inquiry by the superintendent of police, head quarters (SP-H), which had been ordered by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The first wife of NRI Amarjit Singh had submitted a writ petition in the high court. On the complaint of Amarjitâ€™s first wife, a case of bigamy had been registered against him and his second wife Gurmit Singh.

The accused had been arrested and Amarjitâ€™s passport had been seized to keep him from leaving the country. However, the NRI managed to fly to USA, despite his passport being in police custody. The first wife had then filed a writ petition in the high court seeking a probe into the matter.

The probe conducted by SP (H) Vijay Kumar Sharma revealed that the NRI had reportedly paid Rs 5 lakh for the release of his passport and other documents to the DSP and the three junior police officials. The NRI never returned to India but he did, however, reportedly return the passport by post which was once again attached to the case file.

14,"Cong, BJP face-to-face in Delhi Gurdwara polls","AMRITSAR: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Kirpal Singh Badungar said here on Sunday that both the BJP and Congress were indirectly face-to-face in the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections.

While talking to mediapersons, he said Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) was getting moral support from the BJP while Congress was backing Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi) whose election campaign was being monitored by All-India Shiromani Akali Dal chief Gurcharan Singh Tohra. Brushing aside the possibility of any negative impact of the corrupt face of Parkash Singh Badalâ€™s government on the electorate of Delhi, he claimed that SAD (B) would emerge victorious in the DSGMC elections.

He alleged that the Congress government in Punjab was involved in a vindictive drive against the Akalis. He further said that Badal was singlehandedly spearheading his partyâ€™s campaign in Delhi whereas SAD(D)â€™s election campaign was divided into various leaderships who were airing different views. Talking about recent allegations of Puran Singh Josh, a veteran SGPC member, he said the SGPC would duly look into the allegations levelled by him.

On the issue of Prithipal Singh Sandhu, personal assistant of Akal Takht jathedar Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti who is still using his earlier held office despite being retired by the SGPC, Badungar said he would talk to the jathedar regarding the issue.

Badungar had given the same reply a couple of days ago. He also said that the SGPC would contemplate starting its own television channel in the near future.
