0,Harvesting rain water must for govt buildings,"GANDHINAGAR: It has become mandatory for new buildings constructed by the state government to install rain water harvesting system.

The water stored in the percolation well will be used for maintaining gardens and for other purposes.

A notification to this effect has been issued by the state roads and buildings department, which has already asked the district authorities to install the system in 118 government buildings that include the state secretariat, district collectorates and multi-storey complexes in the district headquarters.

It is learnt that the government has sanctioned a sum of Rs 25,000 for each of the 18 buildings identified by the department, on the basis of a report prepared by a committee of senior officials of the department.

I K Jadeja, minister in charge of the department said, ""The mandatory provision has been made for water harvesting system as a part of the government''s campaign for conservation of rain water, which at present is wasted in absence of any arrangement for storage of rain water.""

The system that has been installed at the new building of Anand district collectorate drew the attention of the people who had assembled at the inauguration of the new premises on Friday.

Five major office complexes of the state secretariat and legislative assembly would also benefit from this government directive.

Jadeja said that in future the department will not issue building-use permission to buildings built by the roads and buildings department that do not have the rain water harvesting system.

1,Chhattisgarh govt to spruce up temples,"RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh government is taking steps to implement chief minister Ajit Jogiâ€™s special projects to repair and reconstruct village temples in tribal districts, known as devkudis or thangudis.

Jogi has also said the government will pay wages to village priests and will not allow the opening of any more abattoirs in the state. And the establishment of cow shelters will be encouraged; the government will give loans.

Jogi made the announcement on devkudis last month at Jagdalpur, in the presence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. He said Goddess Dantewashri, the presiding deity in the Bastar region, had appeared in a dream and directed him to take care of the devkudis which were in a bad shape.

The temple of Dantewashri at Dantewara, 400 km from here, is said to be 1,200 years old and has devotees all over the country. The religious functions of the ex-rulers here and the election campaigns of all political parties begin from here.

Jogiâ€™s officers have created a fund of Rs 1.5 crore for renovation of village temples in three districts of Bastar. A joint secretary in the CMâ€™s office has been appointed special officer for the job.

The project has got cabinet approval, but is yet to be formally included in the budget; a supplementary one will be introduced in the state assembly in the coming session, well in time before the November polls.

The tribal-dominated districts of Kanker, Dantewara and Bastar have thousands of devkudis, functioning from make-shift structures. Villagers assemble for rituals at these small temples, most of which are located outside the village. Most of these have no roof.

2,BJP chief rules out mid-term election,"CHANDIGARH: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Venkaiah Naidu has ruled out the preponement of the Lok Sabha elections scheduled for September-October 2004.

Talking to TNN on the sidelines of a three-day training camp for party legislators from north eastern states on the concluding day here on Sunday, Naidu said there was no cause for holding mid term polls. While conceding that the party had fared badly in the last assembly elections in some states â€˜â€˜on local issues"", he expressed confidence that in the assembly elections, slated to be held in five states in September-October this year, the party will win hands down in all, except Mizoram.

The other states going to the polls are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Delhi. Earlier addressing the legislators, Naidu said the next general elections are going to be very significant for the party as it would be seeking a clear two-third mandate from the people on the plank of development. The party would project a vision for the year 2020 of a strong, stable and prosperous nation free of exploitation, corruption, poverty and hunger.

He said it was high time that all the political parties put their heads together to voluntarily adopt a code of conduct for the legislators, and ensure that it was adhered to in letter and spirit, so that the â€˜â€˜shameful"" scenes of them throwing mikes, shoes and chairs at each other were not witnessed in the legislatures. He also favoured framing a law for right-sizing the ministries both in the states and at the Centre.

To form ministries not more than onetenth the strength of respective legislatures should become a rule, he said, adding that by accommodating each and every ruling legislator in either the ministry or as chairpersons of boards and corporations the state governments were making a mockery of democracy. Asserting that the anti-defection law had become a laughing stock, because while prohibiting defections in retail it allowed defections in bulk, he sought its repealment.

In its place a legislation should be enacted making it mandatory for a legislator defecting to another party to surrender his seat and seek a fresh mandate. Making a remark about every party following threepoint agenda of election, selection and collection throughout the year, he advocated five year term for elected public representatives to bring about stability for development and preventing wasteful expenditure. He favoured political parties should decide on holding simultaneous elections in states and centre.

3,PGI's faculty protest foreign duty decision,"CHANDIGARH: PGIâ€™s panacea for one of the â€˜â€˜recurringâ€™â€™ ills plaguing the institute has raised a storm. In a bid to put a stop on the â€˜â€˜unhealthy practiceâ€™â€™ of faculty members taking up foreign assignments for furthering their material gains, the institute has issued a memo to all departmental heads saying that henceforth if any faculty member proceeds on foreign assignment, the period will not be taken into account for promotion.

The circular has sparked off a major controversy and faculty members have brought their displeasure to the notice of union health minister Sushma Swaraj. The genesis of the memo can be traced to PGIâ€™s governing body (GB) meeting held on September 29 last year, which was chaired by then union health minister Shatrughan Sinha.

â€˜â€˜The GB deliberated on the issue and agreed that the unhealthy practice of faculty members of going to work in small hospitals in Gulf countries, mainly with the objective of earning a larger income should not be encouraged since it does not help in upgrading their professional skills. It was decided that the period should not be counted for promotion,â€™â€™ say some GB members. It was also decided that the faculty members proceeding on foreign assignment â€˜â€˜must indicateâ€™â€™ in the agreement the monthly income in foreign currency and â€˜â€˜return six monthsâ€™ salary drawn abroadâ€™â€™ to PGI on violation of the agreement.

â€˜â€˜This was agreed to by the GB to be included as a clause of the agreement,â€™â€™ says a senior PGI official. The faculty members are however sore over the memo since it is being seen as a â€˜â€˜concerted attemptâ€™â€™ to scuttle the path of career progression of the junior faculty. â€˜â€˜As per PGI rules, each faculty member is allowed to take up foreign assignments after every four years. Often, the faculty proceeds on WHO and Commonwealth fellowships and the country they take up the assignment in should not become grounds for discrimination. The junior faculty stands to lose. The minister has assured us that the matter would be looked into,â€™â€™ says a consultant.

As per rules, an assistant professor after four years of service is assessed under the Assessment Promotion Scheme for being promoted as associate professor. Another four years, and he is subjected to the interview for promotion to assistant professor. If not selected, he becomes ineligible for appearing for the interview for the next two years. â€˜â€˜When every day counts, why should we be penalised for undertaking foreign assignments when we are entitled to? Those who overstay should be penalised instead of victimising everyone. If we are not allowed to go abroad, we wouldnâ€™t be able to learn new skills,â€™â€™ quips an associate professor.

An official says that the circular was issued in lieu of the problems being faced by the â€˜â€˜short-staffedâ€™â€™ institute. â€˜â€˜Going by the increasing patient load, it becomes very difficult to cater to the rush if manpower isnâ€™t there. Why should the institute pay the price for absence of faculty members who go with the intention of furthering their material gains,â€™â€™ says a former PGI professor.

5,MP threatens fast if Rajolibandha sluice-gates not closed,"HYDERABAD: Mahabubnagar MP A P Jitender Reddy on Sunday said that the district BJP unit under his leadership would lay siege to the Gadwal mandal office on July 16 if the government fails to close the sluice-gates of the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) before July 15.

Reddy warned that he would sit on fast from July 20 at the Amma Jogulamba temple at Alampur if the government did not take any decision on closing the sluice-gates of RDS before July 19.

He alleged that the government was indifferent to the issues troubling Telangana, particularly in the irrigation sector.

Asked whether he had any understanding with TRS president K Chandrashekhar Rao on the issue as both of them are going to start their agitation on the same day and from the same venue, he said that both were fighting for the Telangana people. Rao will begin his padayatra from the temple on July 20.

The TDP government is doing little for the development of backward districts in Telangana and now it had failed to protect the interests of Mahabubnagar farmers by not closing the sluice-gates of RDS, the MP alleged.

""There would be no compromise on Rajolibanda as it is a lifeline for Mahabubnagar farmers,"" Reddy said.

6,Reddy asks govt to comply with HC orders,"HYDERABAD: Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Sunday asked the government to comply with the order of the High Court on filling all the existing vacancies in Group-II category posts.

In a letter addressed to chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, Reddy said that lakhs of unemployed people were eagerly waiting with a hope that they would get jobs. Most of the unemployed young men were at the edge of attaining the upper age limit and facing hardships due to unemployment and drought, he said.

The CLP leader had alleged that the government had been adopting dilatory tactics, which was evident in the recent recruitment of 141 assistant section officer posts, where in despite the tribunal directing the government to complete the recruitment process with in one month, it has been delaying the process.

""It had completed the recruitment process only due to tremendous pressure from students,"" he said in his letter.

In the larger interest of the unemployed people, the government should fill all vacant posts in various departments immediately to avoid any further agitations by students and jobless people, the CLP leader said.

8,PM's visit: BJP to keep off demand for Central rule,"KOLKATA: During Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayeeâ€™s visit to Kolkata this week, the West Bengal unit of the BJP would apprise him of the â€œatrociticies of the CPMâ€�, but would stop short of demanding Central intervention in the state.

â€œLet the Trinamul Congress demand Presidentâ€™s rule,â€� state BJP president Tathagata Roy said on Sunday. The state BJP had sought an audience with the Prime Minister when he would arrive to address a function to observe the 150th anniversary of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday.

A chamber spokesman said the function would be held at Sonar Bangla Hotel, following which the chamber would host a lunch at Hotel Hyatt Regency in the . After the programme, he would leave for Delhi. The Prime Minister was scheduled to arrive the evening before and stay at Raj Bhavan, he said.

9,DJB defers tariff move for polls,"NEW DELHI: The approaching state polls have apparently forced the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to shelve its plans to charge commercial rates from people running businesses from their homes. The loss-making board had hoped to earn some more revenue with this move.

Refusing to divulge the reasons, DJB chief P K Tripathi just said, â€˜â€˜The move has been deferredâ€™â€™.

With an upward revision of water tariff here â€” which are among the lowest in the country â€” being ruled out by chief minister Sheila Dikshit on many occasions, the DJB was trying to find ways to increase revenue. It earns about Rs 225 crore annually while its annual revenue expenditure is Rs 480 crore.

â€˜â€˜Currently 52 per cent of our revenue comes from domestic connection holders. A large part of these users are running commercial establishments but paying the domestic charge. By converting them, we could get over Rs 10 crore more annually,â€™â€™ a source said.

While the domestic slab rate begins at 35 paise per 1,000 litres for the first 10,000 litres, the commercial charge begins at Rs 5 per 1,000 litres for the first 50,000 litres. There is a 50 per cent cess on the bill.

Had the move been approved, the water bill of a person running a shop from his home and consuming 10,000 litres monthly would have gone up from Rs 5.25 to Rs 75. Even the minimum charge of a commercial meter is Rs 150, as opposed to Rs 30 charged from a domestic user.

â€˜â€˜For this we would have had to survey the entire city. Usually there are complaints of harassment during any survey. With elections a few months away, the decision makers were apprehensive that the move may have a negative effect and was delayed,â€™â€™ said a source.

Even if the survey had passed smoothly, any move to charge more for water was considered politically sensitive, the source added.

10,Man arrested for rape,"NEW DELHI: A 31-year-old man in east Delhi has been arrested for allegedly raping the daughter-in-law of a former inspector of Delhi Police on the pretext of offering her a job.

Joint commissioner of police, B K Gupta, said: â€˜â€˜The accused Rochis Mathur (31), an insurance agent, allegedly raped the 27-year-old woman at his house in Gagan Vihar in east Delhi on the afternoon on June 29.â€™â€™

The Preet Vihar police, however, received the complaint on Saturday evening. On receiving the complaint, medical examinations of the victim and the accused were conducted. A case vide FIR no. 266/03 was registered and Mathur was arrested and produced in the court on Sunday.

According to the police, Rochis gave an advertisement in a Hindi daily seeking â€˜â€˜broad mindedâ€™â€™ personal secretary in the age-group of 18 to 40 years for his upcoming venture. Mathurâ€™s contact numbers were given in the advertisement.

â€˜â€˜The victim called Mathur, who asked her to come to his house immediately. She asked if she could come for the interview the next day, but the accused insisted, saying that it is on first come first served basis,â€™â€™ a local police officer said.

The victim reached Mathurâ€™s house, who took her inside and asked for sexual favours by offering her a better salary package on appointment. When she resisted, Mathur allegedly raped her, the police said.

The victim lives in Bhajanpura in northeast Delhi. Her husband runs a nursery in Ashok Vihar. Mathur lives with his wife at his Gagan Vihar residence. She had gone to her parents home in south Delhi at the time of theincident.

11,"Jarasandh is a religion, says minister","PATNA: Jarasandh was the victim of historical ""distortion"", said speakers while describing the mythological character of the Mahabharata-era at a function organised in the S K Memorial Hall here on Sunday to mark the release of a stamp on Jarasandh.

""We will adopt all such characters like Shani, Rahu, Ketu and Jarasandh in our life. The history failed to do justice with them. Now we are educated. We will write a fresh history and include them,"" said junior Union minister for human resources development Sanjay Paswan.

According to Paswan, Jarasandh is a religion which teaches people to hate ""deceit and duplicity"".

""The followers of Jarasandh dharma will take care of the poor. We will ensure upliftment of those who sit in the front of the high court with parrots to make their both ends meet,"" the minister told a gathering while describing Jarasandh as a symbol of the ""deprived sections"" of the society.

Releasing the stamp on Jarasandh, governor M Rama Jois said: ""This is a golden day in the

history of India. Today, people forget a ruler soon after the end of their five-year tenure. But you all are remembering Jarasandh who ruled about 5000 years back. He was really a popular king."" He further said: ""Enacting the role of Mahabharata-fame Sanjay, Union minister Sanjay Paswan today told me the story of Jarasandh.""

State excise minister and RJD spokesman Shivanand Tiwary told the gathering that he had little knowledge about Jarasandhâ€™s history before coming to the S K Memorial Hall. ""On the basis of Mahabharata, I was under the impression that Jarasandh might have been a ruler born in upper caste. Later, my friends among the Chandravanshi community informed me that they considered Jarasandh as their â€˜aadi purushâ€™. But at what stage of the history, this Chandravansi community reached to a lowly place in the society. This is a question which haunts me,"" he added.

While quoting from the mythology, chief postmaster general of the Bihar circle S P Singh described Jarasandh as the first king of this country. He said that the stamp on Jarasandh depicted Natarajâ€™s posture.

Purnia MP Pappu Yadav said that Jarasandh had attained popularity because he had struggled against Lord Krishna. ""Bihar needs a character like Jarasandh,"" he remarked.

While quoting from Vayu Purana and other epics, former BPSC member Shiva Jatan Thakur described Jarasandh as a ""rich and powerful personality"".

He said that Jarasandh had attacked Mathura at least on different occasions but never harmed the common people.

The function was attended by NDAâ€™s state convener Nand Kishore Yadav, chief general manager (telecom) S A Thomas and MLA Prem Kumar.

12,"Amarinder to administer oath to 90,000 panches","CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh would administer oath of office to over 90,000 newly elected panches and sarpanches covering some 12,000 village panchayats of the state on July 17, said sources in the department.

The oath ceremony would be organised at Jalandhar and Patiala for the villages falling in these divisions respectively, while sarpanches and panches of Ferozepur and Faridkot division would attend the function at Bathinda.

This is for the first time that all the sarpanches of the state would be formally entering their office on the same day.

The government is setting a time frame to empower panchayats progressively by entrusting more and more functions and enhancing their financial powers too. The upper limit for spending by panchyats at their own level is likely to be doubled from Rs five lakh to Rs 10 lakh soon.

For smooth functioning of panchayats, the government has decided to impart two-day training to all panches at block level camps in collaboration with recognised institutions and NGOs, to create greater awareness among them of their powers and roles.

The training module would expose them to the functioning of the 29 government departments, which the 73rd constitutional amendment proposes to hand over to the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs). Also, they would be educated about the numerous Centrally-sponsored schemes, where the village gram sabha itself can take initiative for speedy development of the village.

The training programme that would start from mid August would take from six to eight months to train over 90,000 panches and sarpanches in the state.

Meanwhile, the empowered sub-committee of the National Development Council (NDC) is meeting this weekend in Delhi to draw up a map for empowering PRIs. Most states have done precious little in delegating powers to their PRIs, even eight years after the passage of the 73rd and 74th amendments -- which promised to transfer 29 departments related to rural development to the PRIs along with their budget.

The Union government is anxious for empowering PRIs and has issued directives from time to time, but the states have not honoured their own commitments. The mandatory periodical elections to the PRIs have not been held and even threats of linking these to release of fund for the centrally sponsored schemes have not yielded desired results.

Though, the Congress central leadership, especially its president Sonia Gandhi, has emphasised empowering PRIs at the party conclaves in recent past, but the ministers at state level are reluctant to share power with their poor brother representatives from gram sabhas, which had been the main stumbling block in empowering PRIs.

13,"Mass transfers against policy, say teachers","LUDHIANA: The Government College Teachers Association (GCTA) Punjab on Monday alleged that the recent transfers of teachers in the state was a clear violation of the governmentâ€™s transfer policy. And urged the government to maintain status quo till the proposed meetings with the association at Chandigarh on July 17.

As per GCTA general secretary Jaipal Singh, separate meetings have been fixed with the chief minister and the higher education minister. The meeting with the minister was fixed during his visit to the Government College for Boys here on Monday.

The government had transferred 80 teachers all over the state through two separate orders on July 8 and 11. As per the first order as many as 14 transfers were effected while 76 were shifted later. Ironically, in certain cases transfers were made contrary to the reasons cited in the orders, he said.

For instance, administrative reason was cited in the case of three lecturers against whom no inquiry was instituted.

Another glaring anomaly was committed in the case of single, unmarried and widow cases. Sikandar Kaur, who teaches history at Jawahar Lal Nehru College Mandi, Gobindgarh, was shifted to Government College, Patti, despite her request for transfer to Patiala. The post she had asked for is still vacant, claimed Singh. Similarly, Kusum Lata Sharma, a widow teaching Sanskrit at Government College, Mohali, was shifted to Government Ranbir College, Sangrur.

Maintaining that there was no objection to shifting of lecturers â€œon requestâ€�, Singh took exception to the governmentâ€™s apathy towards those uprooted in the process.

He put the number of such cases to at least 10. Interestingly, these include cases where lecturers were shifted to places other than their preference, though the orders clearly say that they were being transferred on request, he said.

Another cause of resentment pertained to about 20 cases where transfers were made in â€œpublic interestâ€�.

It included the case of state GCTA president Bhag Singh Sandhu teaching mathematics at Government Mahendra College, Patiala.

14,ROs may sue minister for tarnishing image,"BATHINDA: The Punjab Revenue Officersâ€™ Association (PROA) took a stand against Amarjit Singh Samra, minister of state for revenue and rehabilitation, in its meeting on Sunday. The minister had recently alleged that some of the revenue officers were corrupt and were causing huge loss of revenue to the state exchequer by helping evasion of stamp duty.

The revenue officers said at the meeting that the ministerâ€™s claim that his tightening the noose around revenue officers had led to an increase of Rs 117 crore as revenue on stamp duty was devoid of merit and was only a statement in self-praise.

The revenue officers claimed that the increase in the revenue was a fruit of their efforts and the minister had no role to play in it. The officials added that it was the minister who was accusing the revenue officers of being corrupt.

They criticised the ministerâ€™s statement made at a public function in Muktsar during the special drive for attestation of mutations. The minister had said at the function that he had saved Rs 300 crore of the people which they would have had to give to the revenue officers as bribe to get their job done.

The revenue officers said that this amounted to painting his own department black.

Ridiculing the ministerâ€™s statement, Amar Pal Singh Tiwana, association president said that the statement was made by the minister to gain cheap popularity.

He said nobody knows how the minister arrived at the figure of Rs 300 crore.

Tiwana said that the association was thinking of suing the minister for tarnishing the image of his own department and its officers. He said that if minister was feeling so suffocated in the department, it would be better for him to take up another portfolio.

Tiwana said that the charter of demands has been prepared and would be sent to the state financial commissioner (revenue).

Some of the main demands include immediate withdrawal of false and fabricated vigilance cases against revenue officers as per the assurance of the chief minister, gazetted status for naib-tehsildars as in Himachal Pradesh and filling up of vacant posts of tehsildars by assigning current duty charge to senior naib-tehsildars among others.
