0,Sewage plants have major flaw,"New Delhi: After spending about Rs 500 crore in setting up 15 sewage treatment plants (STPs) around the city, the Delhi Jal Board has realised that these expensive contraptions do not serve the basic purpose â€” that is to decimate the deadly faecal coliform bacteria present in the sewage.

Realising the flaw in existing plants, the water board has decided to set up more STPs which would be equipped to treat the faecal coliform. The DJB plans to spend Rs 939 crore to upgrade the existing plants and set up new STPs which can bring down the coliform level to permissible limits.

The STPs have been built to treat sewage that flows into the Yamuna. But DJB chief P K Tripathi conceded that the existing plants do everything but treat the coliform. So, despite the huge expenses incurred by the DJB, the Yamuna is still flooded with coliform bacteria â€” almost seven crore in 100 millilitres (ml) of river water, as against the permissible limit of 5,000 per 100 ml.

Tripathi said the existing STPs can only do secondary treatment of the sewage. â€˜â€˜To bring down the coliform level in the treated sewage, we need to set up plants equipped for tertiary treatment,â€™â€™ he said.

The Jal Board, which has only built 14 of the 16 STPs it had promised the Supreme Court, maintains it was not briefed properly by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on the technological requirements of STPs. The CPCB monitors all operations to clean the Yamuna.

Binay Jha, DJBâ€™s director (finance), said the board has no specifications from the CPCB on the coliform level. â€˜â€˜When the plants were being constructed, the CPCB gave us the permissible limit for biological oxygen demand (BOD) and the level of suspended solids in the treated sewage. Our secondary treatment plants were meeting those targets,â€™â€™ he said.

After the court set March 2003 as the deadline to clean the Yamuna, that the CPCB directed the DJB to bring down coliform levels to 1,000 per ml of treated water.

1,New cable laws criticised,"Mumbai: Recent changes to the cable TV act changes nothing for the harassed consumer. Experts say the amendment holds out no redress, proposes no end operatorsâ€™ ground monopolies and inflicts a multi-crore injury on the nationâ€™s viewers with set-top boxes. They also criticise the governmentâ€™s new role in deciding which free-to-air channels will get into the basic tier. Consumer groups say ambiguity remains regarding redressal. According to unchanged parts of the Cable Network Regulation Act, â€˜95, an operator has to register with the local head postmaster. However, the post and telegraph department does not have powers to act on violations. â€œWe do not have powers beyond licensing and cannot act on consumer complaints,â€™â€™ says a senior postal official. â€œIn the first place, isnâ€™t it absurd of the government to involve the postmaster in cable TV affairs?â€™â€™ says Shirish Deshpande of the Mumbai Grahak Panchayat. The city collectorâ€™s office, which recovers entertainment duty, says what the cable guy charges the consumer does not come under its purview. â€œThe Entertainment Duty Act, 1923, per se does not have the force required to ensure strict compliance. The operator does not invite criminal liability,â€™â€™ says city collector Debashish Chakravarty, adding, â€œI donâ€™t think there is a regulator as far as cable TV is concerned.â€™â€™ Under the conditional access system (CAS), the government will fix a price for the basic free-to-air tier through a gazette notification. The consumer can complain to the police or move a consumer court if it is violated, but no redress is guaranteed. Consumer groups also allege that the government could have had an interest in foisting the set-top box manufacturing and marketing industry. To be priced at Rs 2,500 upward for piece and aimed at 40 million cable homes, one is looking at well over Rs 10,000 crore in box sales automatically. Since CAS will widen declared connections drastically and multiply revenue, pay channels and MSOs should bear the cost of these set-top boxes, feel activists. Anand Patwardhan of the Consumer Guidance Society of India says since government can tamper with the basic tier, many free channels will probably attach a nominal price tag to avoid official hassles. â€œThe government is abetting proliferation of pay channels and blocking free flow of information,â€™â€™ he says. â€œWith little or no under-declaration, the cable fee should become one-fifth.â€™â€™ Mr Deshpande says, â€œPrivatisation and competition cannot be unregulated. However, government should not have assumed the regulatorâ€™s role. Instead, an independent body should be deciding how much cable operators may charge from end users.â€™â€™

2,‘UK govt will have to pay costs awarded to Nadeem’,"MUMBAI: Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said the costs awarded by the UK high court to music composer Nadeem Akhtar Saifee, in the extradition proceedings launched against him by the Indian government for his alleged complicity in the Gulshan Kumar murder case, have to be borne by the British government alone. He said there is no practice of reimbursement of costs for extradition proceedings initiated by a government. This is because extradition proceedings are conducted by governments on the basis of reciprocity. Mr Nikam said it is totally erroneous to say that the costs awarded to Nadeem would ever be recovered from the Indian government. Sources said the Indian government recently requested the Crown prosecution service in the UK to ascertain the actual costs awarded to Nadeem who was discharged from the extradition proceedings in December 2000. Nadeemâ€™s counsel Majeed Memon said in its order discharging Nadeem from the extradition proceedings, the UK court had directed the court master to compute the cost of litigation payable to the music composer. The amount was to the tune of Rs 6.7 crore and it has been paid to Nadeem by the British government. Mr Memon had earlier said that the amount would be recovered from the Indian government. He, however, clarified now that he had been under the impression then that the amount was recoverable from the Indian government. Recently the Indian high commission in UK also clarified to the Mumbai police that no UK court had awarded damages or compensation to Nadeem for the extradition proceedings. The commission had noted that since Nadeem had hired a lawyer to defend him and had not depended on legal aid provided by the British government, the court had in accordance with the British legal system awarded him the cost incurred by him in his defence. Mr Memon had to travel 22 times to London from Mumbai for the court proceedings. Mr Memon said, â€œThe amount received by Nadeem was the cost of litigation and not damages since the order of the London high court had directed the award of only litigation costs. We never made any false claim of saying it was damages.â€™â€™ â€œFor claiming damages a suit has to be filed for it,â€™â€™ he added. Mr Memon said, â€œAfter Nadeemâ€™s discharge from the extradition proceedings, we have been contemplating suing the Indian government for damages. But that shall be done purely on merits of the case and not as a witch hunt or a vendetta against any police officer.â€™â€™ The UK court while ruling in Nadeemâ€™s favour had censured the Mumbai police for seeking to extradite the composer without any evidence against him. The UK court on December 21, 2000 directed that Nadeem â€œbe discharged forthwith in relation to the offences in respect of which his return is sought by the Indian government.â€™â€™ Meanwhile, the Bombay HC recently in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) had issued notices to former Mumbai police commissioner R.H. Mendonca and senior police officer D. Sivanandan. The PIL was filed by a social activist C.L. Anto seeking to restrain the state government from bearing the heavy costs paid to Nadeem after the Centre failed to extradite him from London.

4,Sena corporator arrested for abusing bank officer,"Mumbai: The Kherwadi police on Tuesday arrested Shiv Sena corporator Prakash alias Bala Sawant for allegedly abusing and threatening Bank of India branch manager Seema Manjrekar because she refused to grant a loan to a Kherwadi resident.

Mr Sawant, who is also the law committee chairman of the Brihanmumbai municipal corporation (BMC), was immediately released on bail. The incident on May 15 had created a flutter in the city and deputy chief minister, Chhagan Bhujbal, ordered the police commissioner to take action.

Ms Manjrekar (46) is the manager of BoIâ€™s Bandra East branch. She said that Mr Sawant barged into her office and started abusing her because she had refused a loan of Rs 20,000 to Seetabai Jadhav, a resident of Bharat Nagar slum.

He threatened to force the branch to close down and tugged at her blouse, she alleged. She said the Kherwadi police refused to register a proper first information report. Finally, the police booked a non-cognisable complaint.

The FIR was only registered on Monday, after Ms Manjrekar and bank officers took up the matter with senior police officials. The police booked Mr Sawant under sections 509 (abusing), 353 (preventing a public servant from doing her duty) and 506 (threat) of the Indian Penal Code. The police did not invoke section 354, which relates to outraging the modesty of a woman.

â€œAn inquiry is still on into the allegations made by Ms Manjrekar. Fresh charges can be booked if related offences are made out after the inquiry,â€™â€™ zonal deputy commissioner of police Bipin Bihari told TNN.

Additional commissioner of police Ramrao Wagh asserted that action would be taken against the police official who allegedly refused to accept Ms Manjrekarâ€™s complaint.

Ms Manjrekar had alleged that when she reached the police station after the incident, Mr Sawant was already present there. The duty officer refused to identify himself and pulled over his pocket flap over his name badge, she claimed.

â€œWe have to ascertain if the delay (in taking the complaint) was deliberate or if it was because of negligence. But we will will certainly act against an officer if he or she is found at fault,â€™â€™ Mr Wagh said.

Assistant commissioner of police D.S. Thakur is conducting the inquiry into Ms Manjrekarâ€™s allegations. So far, the police have recorded the statements of five bank employees and three customers who were witnesses to the incident.

â€œI hope the police take action against the guilty police official. I am a diabetic and suffer from hypertension. I am already exhausted visiting the police station and senior police officials to narrate the incident. For a white-collared banker like me, the incident has completely left me dazed,â€™â€™ she told TNN.

On his part, Mr Sawant denied the allegations. He also denied that he abused Ms Manjrekar or that he had outraged her modesty. â€œThe bank had asked for a deposit of Rs 10,000 against the loan of Rs 20,000. The loans are disbursed under the Swarna Jayanti scheme of the BMC. But when I pleaded Seetabaiâ€™s case with her, Ms Manjrekar started scolding me,â€™â€™ he said. â€œAll her allegations are false.â€™â€™

According to Ms Manjrekar, banks exercise caution while disbursing soft loans because slum dwellers have demonstrated a tendency to shift their homes after taking the loans, making it difficult for the bank to recover its money.

Ms Manjrekar said that since she was busy with another customer, Mr Sawant and his group was told to wait.

5,"Wheat farmers being exploited, says Oppn","LUCKNOW: UP Assembly witnessed frequent adjournments on Tuesday following heated exchanges between members of the treasury bench and the Opposition over various issues, including wheat procurement.

Raising the wheat issue, Kiran Pal of SP said that the procurement done by the government was open to question as there were no purchase centres and the farmers were being exploited and harassed.

Parliamentary affair minister Sukhdev Rajbhar was hooted down by the Opposition, which charged him with giving an evasive reply. This led an acrimonious scene and adjournment twice. Speaker KN Tripathi directed the Govtto make a written reply about the issue and also reply to the oppositionâ€™s query about the district-wise progress.

6,SC admits plea seeking CBI probe into riots,"Mumbai: The supreme court recently admitted Raza Academyâ€™s petition seeking a CBI probe into the Gujarat riots.

The petition has also demanded the dismissal of the Gujarat government for its alleged failure to contain the riots. Mohammad Saeed Noori, academyâ€™s general secretary said that they would move the court to secure justice for riot victims.

Criticising politicians, ruling and opposition, Mr Noori said they have exploited the situation in Gujarat for narrow political gains. â€œHad the politicians been sincere in their efforts, the riots would not have continued in Gujarat for 80 long days,â€™â€™ he said.

While the academy has sought a CBI probe, it has expressed reservations about the governmentâ€™s enquiry commission to probe the Godhra incident and the post-Godhra riots. The petitioner has requested the apex court to set aside the government notification regarding the appointment of Justice K.G. Shah to enquire into the riots. â€œWe have no faith in the Narendra Modi government,â€™â€™ Mr Noori said.

The academy said recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) should be implemented. These recommendations include appointment of special courts to try riot cases, various rehabilitation measures like the repair of damaged places of worship, compensation to riot victims etc.

The Union government, Gujarat government and its chief minister Narendra Modi, director general of Gujarat police and the state units of BJP, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal are the respondents to the petition. Last month, the academy had organised the â€˜save democracy conventionâ€™ in New Delhi to take steps to safeguard the rights of minorities.

â€œWe decided to file the petition as a last resort to secure justice for the riot victimsâ€™â€™, he said.

7,"A pledge to fight terrorism, literally","LUCKNOW: You have heard of Valentineâ€™s Day, Motherâ€™s Day, Fatherâ€™s Day, Childrenâ€™s Day, Teacherâ€™s Day and other assorted days, those flash-in-the-pan events which one forgets till they arrive again next year.

Now, here is another one added to the long list â€” a government sponsored â€˜Anti-Terrorism Dayâ€™. The mandatory patriotic drill was observed by all the government offices in the state on Tuesday.

The inspiration behind the exercise was a long forgotten DO dated May 13, 1992 issued by the then home minister SB Chavan. Chavan had decided upon observing May 21 as an â€˜Anti-Terrorism Dayâ€™ that year, which he obviously could not, due to reason best known to him. Chavanâ€™s wishes came true after a gap of full 10 years as the government servants in UP dutifully lined up and resolved to fight terrorism here.

And fighting terrorism could not ever have been easier as the great action plan was limited strictly to words. The entire exercise began and ended with a pledge which formed its most important part. Incidentally, the pledge itself, was very cautiously worded. On the one hand, one was required to â€œsolemnly affirm to oppose with all his or her might, all forms of terrorism and violenceâ€� before being tactfully reminded of the â€œcountryâ€™s tradition of of non-violence and toleranceâ€�.

As for those desirous to go beyond mere words, there were other bright ideas the order offered. They could, for instance, organise seminars, symposium, lectures on the issue or go in for â€œappropriate projection through the mediaâ€� or could start a poster or pamphlet war.

More enthusiastic among the lot could, also going by the order, invite prominent film stars or other known personalities to teach the uninitiated a few things about â€˜deshbhaktiâ€™. Some could even say it with music and dance by mixing patriotism with pleasure and organise the musical and recreational functions. And that was not all.

One could also wear patriotism literally on his sleeves as the order even suggested â€œdistribution of T-shirts with attractive anti-violence/terrorist slogans.

So as the heads of the departments carried out their part with as solemnly they could by administering the pledge to the pan chewing, fidgety and giggly subordinate staff, heavy to break away from the monotony of their desks, one of them quipped â€” â€œthe General, sure must be a worried man today.â€�

8,New traffic rules in Inox multiplex area,"Pune: Paucity of parking space at the newly-opened Inox movie multiplex has started causing major traffic jams on the once-peaceful stretch of Bund Garden road between Council Hall and Residency Club.

The traffic police have therefore banned vehicular parking on the stretch. Matters came to a head on Saturday when a few moviegoers parked their vehicles haphazardly opposite the collectorâ€™s house and adjoining properties on the road.

Speaking to the Times Of India, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ravindra Sengaonkar said that the 300-m road stretch had witnessed severe traffic snarls on the last two weekends. He has also warned of stern action against those found defying the parking ban on Sassoon road.

Traffic in the area had already been hit by the partial closure of Sassoon road between Wadia College and Tadiwala road, on account of concreting. The traffic thus diverted runs into the traffic jams created by the Inox multiplex.

Shishir Baijal, CEO, Inox Leisure said the company had initiated talks with private parties for alternative parking space. â€œWe are trying to acquire land for additional 60 cars and things should be clear within this week,â€� assured Baijal.

General manager Paul Pinto at Inox, told Times News Network that the four-screen multiplex with 1,300 seating capacity runs to packed houses on weekends. It has two parking lots, one with 130-car and 400 two wheelers.

As a result, people who donâ€™t find space in the parking lots, started parking their vehicles on the main approach road.

Meanwhile, affected property owners have deputed round-the-clock security guards and installed â€˜No Parkingâ€™ boards through the approach road.

9,RIL inks pact with govt for IPCL stake,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries on Tuesday night signed an agreement for acquisition of 26 per cent stake of government in petrochemical PSU IPCL along with management control for a total of Rs 1490 crore.

The financial transaction would be completed on June 4 after which the government would transfer its holding to Reliance to make the Mumbai-based corporate house a partner in IPCL.

The agreement was signed by K P Nanavati on behalf of Reliance Industries while joint secretary in petrochemical ministry Ashok Chawla, who is also acting chairman and managing director of IPCL, represented the government. IPCL director (finance) S Shah was the third signatory to the agreement.

Government had last week approved the bid of Reliance, which quoted Rs 231 per share as against the second highest bidder IndianOil''s Rs 128 per share. Reliance had bid 76 per cent higher than the reserve price of Rs 131 per share fixed by the disinvestment advisor Warburg.

The signing of the agreement was, however, held up for a few hours for obtaining the clearance from law and company affairs ministry on certain clauses relating to monopoly issues, sources said.

Disinvestment secretary Pradip Baijal and joint secretary P K Basu were also present on the occasion.

Sources said that Reliance would sign the shareholders agreement and pay a cheque for Rs 1,490 crore to the government on June 4.

RIL would reconstitute the IPCL board appointing six directors, including the chairman and managing director, while there would be four independent directors of the board. Government would appoint two directors on the newly constituted board.

As per the share purchase agreement, RIL would not be able to retrench any employee of the IPCL for a minimum period of one year and would have to take prior government approval in case of sale of any of the corporation''s assets, sources said.

Earlier, signing of the share purchase agreement was delayed for want of mandatory clearance required from the Department of Company Affairs in case the acquisition leads to a monopoly like situation, they said, adding the no objection certificate under section 108 (A) of the Companies Act was finally given in the evening, paving the way for signing of the agreement.

10,"ASE, ACE moot multi-commodity exchange","Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Stock Exchange (ASE) in association with the Ahmedabad Commodities Exchange (ACE) will shortly file an application with the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) for setting up a national multi-commodity exchange before FMC''s May 31 deadline.

The new executive director of ASE aims to make the exchange a consolidated one with a national reach. ""Apart from equities trading, ASE plans to become a national-level commodities exchange, offer derivatives trading in stocks and commodities, begin trading in government securities (G-Sec) and later on offer forex and bullion trading,"" said Anjani Sinha, the new executive director (ED) of the ASE.

Before joining as ED at ASE, Sinha was the CEO of the Bombay Commodities Exchange and prior to that he was with the Integrated Stock Exchange (ISE).

He said the ASE and ACE combination are in a better position to offer commodities trading as ASE has expertise in online trading while ACE has expertise in actual commodities trading. ""The NSE and BSE have a strong national presence in equities trading but they have no experience in commodities trading. The unique selling proposition (USP) of the ASE and ACE combine is that they already have an existing base of buyers and sellers in castor and cotton seeds as well as equities. ASE and ACE are working towards starting online trading in castor and cotton seeds by July end,"" said Sinha.

11,New AUDA plan gets govt nod,"AHMEDABAD: The state government has given its go-ahead to the revised development plan (DP) of the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) envisaging a planned urban growth in AUDA areas for the next ten years.

The decision has come after AUDA painstakingly revised the 1986 DP for a period of four years before sending it for final approval to the government.

Before the government gave its go-ahead, it received around 700 objections on the revised DP, besides incorporating suggestions from builders, architects, engineers and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.

According to the new DP, 212.67 sq km has been given for residential zone-I, 33.18 sq km for residential-II zone and 36.07 sq km for residential-III zone, out of a total area of 1294.62 sq km. The new floor space index (FSI) ration for R-I zone will be 1:8, R-II 1:2 and R-III 0:3.

Basement and cellar height has been increased from 2.5 metres to 3 metres, while in low-rise structures, height of the rooms can be increased to a maximum of 3 metres.

Another feature in the revised DP is an increase in the height of low-rise buildings to 16.5 metres from 15 metres. There should be a provision for lift if the building has basement plus three floors.

12,Dhana urban bank directors arrested,"VIJAYAWADA: The Eluru police arrested the vice-chairman and four directors of the Dhana Co-operative Urban Bank on Tuesday in connection with the Rs 3-crore bank scam.

Bank chairman R S Sagar is yet to be arrested. Bank vice-chairman D Ravi Kumar, directors, T N Prasad, R V V Rama Rao, Ch Giri and B Narasimha Murthy were among the arrested. West Godavari district superintendent of police Kripanand Tripathi Ujela said that investigations into the bank scam established that a sum of Rs 3 crore was swindled under various heads for which the bank chairman and other directors were accountable.

Investigations revealed that Dhana Bank chairman R S Sagar diverted a sum of Rs 1.92 crore to Lordyn and Fruitwell India Limited, a non-existent company, while he gave away Rs 24 lakh and Rs 10 lakh respectively to Francis Xavier and Venkoba Rao.

Interestingly, Sagar purchased a 500 sq yard site at Chodimella village on the outskirts of Eluru town, valued at Rs 76,000, in the name of his servant G Gopi. Sagar secured a loan of Rs 14 lakh on Gopiâ€™s name by pledging the site. Gopi pleaded innocence about this when the police questioned him.

The Eluru divisional cooperative officer, who inspected the bank accounts on April 27, found glaring irregularities in the bank transactions. A team of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials that visited the bank observed that none of the directors of the bank had any knowledge in banking. The police are continuing the hunt for bank chairman Sagar.

13,No need to wait till Feb for polls: Cong,"AHMEDABAD: In an apparent turnaround in the party''s stance, the All-India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Gujarat Kamal Nath stated on Monday that ""if peace prevailed in the state there was no need to wait till February 2003 to hold the Assembly elections"". He said this figured in the discussions in the general body meeting of the party of the newly-appointed PCC, on Monday morning

Justifying the statement he said, ""it was a question of saving Gujarat and the earlier they bid goodbye to the BJP, the better it was for Gujarat''s progress"". He accused the BJP of surviving on a policy of dividing Gujarat.

Even as Nath was being barraged with questions about the Congress'' sudden readiness to go to the polls, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee president Amarsinh Chaudhary declared the party''s plans to begin the new PCC term by hosting a meeting in the temple town of Somnath some time before June 10. Asked why they were following the BJP''s strategy (LK Advani led a rathyatra from Somnath), Chaudhary told TNN, ""when I became president I had vowed at the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Somnath that I would begin my first party meeting from here"".

Kamal Nath said that it was on account of the Congress'' proposal to effect Article 355 that KPS Gill was moved to Gujarat. ""If they had done it earlier, violence would have stopped a fortnight back"", he said.

When questioned as to what action he would take on those members of the Congress who had met Chief Minister Narendra Modi and were contemplating a switch, he said, ""this is all false propaganda by the BJP and even if it is true, there are several MLAs from the BJP who want to come to the Congress"".

Asked ""who"", he said, ""there are ten of them at least"", but refused to divulge names. Nath, who was accompanied by Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel, also denied of having received any complaints from minority leaders about a change in leadership in the state Congress.

Later, Chaudhary emphasised that several conventions would be held at the district and taluka levels which would be attended by senior leaders like Madhavsinh Solanki, Shankersinh Vaghela, Urmila Patel and himself. He said that the party had planned a major public meeting before June 15 to be addressed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi at Limkheda, strategically chosen for its proximity to the tribal-dominated Dahod, the now infamous Godhra and Madhya Pradesh!

Chaudhary said that meetings would also be held in Junagadh, Surat, Dumas and other areas of Central and North Gujarat as a preparatory to the Assembly elections which were eight months away.

Asked why the party had suddenly changed its stance on the elections, Nath said, ""we are not in a hurry, it is they (the BJP) which said that they wanted early polls and we are saying that we are ready as soon as normalcy prevails and people return from the camps"".

14,Cabinet defers new agro policy,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal Cabinet on Tuesday postponed discussion of the new agricultural policy owing to opposition from within the CPM as well as from several Left Front partners.

Though chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself admitted to the differences, he said the new policy would be finalised at the next Cabinet meeting.

Later, the core committee held its meeting, too, at Writersâ€™ Buildings. This body, a kind of super Cabinet, formed after persistent pressures from the LF partners, discussed the issue of poor power supply, bad irrigation and distress sale by paddy growers.

Bhattacharjee said the decision on support price would be declared by the second week of June.

â€œWe have deferred the passage of the new agro-policy owing to differences of opinion among some ministers. I have told them to submit their views in writing,â€� he said.

While Bhattacharjee declined to elaborate on the differences, state agriculture minister Kamal Guha made it clear that they were opposed to accepting what the World Trade Organisation was sug-gesting.

â€œThe policy document placed today referred to the Centreâ€™s acceptance of WTO agreements. But instead of opposing it anymore, the new policy wants us to avail of the opportunities created by these agreements,â€� said Guha.

â€œThe promotion of cultivation of cash crops and commercial capitalintensive farming to cater the need of globalised market-ing of agro products is the focal point of new ideas. But WTO ref-erences were not present in the original draft that I had seen,â€� he added.

Guha insisted that the new policy could be passed only after detailed discussions with peasants organisations and Front partners. Other Front ministers pointed out that the CM himself wanted to defer the discussion.

15,Sediment increasing coast in Sunderbans,"KOLKATA: The coastline on the Indian side of the Sundarbans has been increasing at the rate of 112 hectares per year, says a study conducted by the School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University.

The reason behind this is the enhanced sediment carrying capacity of the Bhagirathi river due to tremendous discharge from the Farakka barrage. According to chief conservator of forests (planning and monitoring) Pranabesh Sanyal, these changes in the coastline are of â€œmomentous significance.â€�

New land is being created, giving the sensitive Sundarban eco-system more space to grow. The forest cover is increasing and acting as a barrier to the sea coming inland.

â€œThe most important result of this is that saline ingress into ground water sources is being controlled. As the sea moves back, salinity of the land will also decrease,â€� Sanyal said.

The movements of the coastline are being monitored by the School of Oceanographic Studies.

The first satellite map was studied in 1989. This was followed by the study of another satellite image of the coastline in 1995.

Another map generated in 2000 is currently being studied. Sanyal, who also happens to be the chief environment officer and National Coastal Zone Management Authority member, said that before the barrage was discharging water into the Bhagirathi, the Sagar Island was retrograding at the rate of 45.3 hectare per year for the last 144 years.

17,"Keep diplomatic options open, Sonia tells govt","NEW DELHI: Congress President Sonia Gandhi said on Wednesday that the government was not doing enough to address the Kashmir problem and urged it to keep diplomatic options open.

""Not enough is being done by the government to give the feeling to different groups in Kashmir that they are serious in their efforts to bring about amity. We want concerted efforts on this,"" she said after the Congress Working Committee meet in the Capital on Wednesday.

The Opposition leader described the situation along the border as ""very fragile"" and urged the government to keep diplomatic options open. There should be more efforts to involve the international community and to highlight India''s plight, of which the Kaluchak massacre and the assassination of Abdul Ghani Lone were ample proof, she said.

On the assassination, she said that it was obvious that certain forces did not want the J&K issue to be resolved. The Congress, she said, also saw this as a move to derail the impending election process in the state.

The CWC meet was convened as a precursor to the AICC session on Friday. It discussed the drafts of the three resolutions - political, economic and foreign affairs - to be adopted at the meeting.

Additional Secretary in the Home department C Tawnluaia said that the four-member BNLF delegation would be led by Bruto Meska, communication secretary of the outfit while the state government delegation would be headed by Chief Secretary H V Lalringa.

Bruto Meska replaced Zaithanga Apeto, self-styled ''home secretary'' of the BNLF who led the outfit''s delegation in all the four rounds of talks held earlier.

Three representatives of the Bru Welfare Association of Mizoram would also participate in the dialogue, Tawnluaia said.

The BNLF, which demanded a separate autonomous district council for the Reang/Bru community in Mizoram, has been indulging in violent activities against the government and people of Mizoram since late 1997 including murder, abduction and extortion from its hideouts in Bangladesh and Tripura.

The leadership of the outfit was compelled to come to the negotiating table as the Mizoram government insisted that repatriation of Brus from six refugee camps in neighbouring Tripura would not be implemented unless and until the BNLF lays down arms and eschew violence.

21,Sincerity of BJP tribute to Lone doubted,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Confederation of Human Rights Organisations has questioned the sincerity of Prime Minister Vajpayee and Home Minister L K Advani who paid rich tributes to the assassinated Hurriyat Conference Leader Abdul Gani Lone.Confederation Leader Mukundan Menon said when Gani visited Kerala last year, the BJP and RSS had raised a hue and cry against the government for allowing ""extremists"" to visit the state. Now the same forces have described the late leader as a moderate voice among hawks and blamed Pakistan for his killing.The human rightist said only political solution can resolve the Kashmir issue and the Central government should make use of the Hurriyat for this purpose. The arrest of JKLF leader Yassin Malik under POTA recently was another folly the government had committed. His life too was in danger.

22,`Farmers have no option but to commit suicide',"MANDYA: President of women''s wing of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) Sunanda Jayaram called for a non-co-operation movement to protest the state government''s failure to fulfil the demands of the farmers of Maddur and Malavalli taluks.

``Over 40 lakh tonnes of sugarcane has been destroyed and almost all the paddy cultivated in the area has dried up. The sugar companies have not made the payment of arrears to the farmers for the past one year. Now the crop is lost. They have to wait till the next crop is cultivated. If lucky, farmers may earn some money only after a gap of four years. If the same condition prevails, there is no other go but commit suicide,'''' she lamented.

It is to be recalled that the farmers of Maddur, Kiragavalu and Malavalli assembly constituencies have been protesting for the past one week demanding release of water in the Visvesvaraya canal for their drying crops. This crisis recurs every summer as the Krishnarajasagar reservoir dries up.

The farmers staged a `rasta roko'', laid siege to the sub-division office of the canal and protested the irresponsibility of the irrigation department officials.

Sunanda appealed to the farmers against paying any tax to and repaying loans to the government. She demanded immediate release of compensation for the crop loss and interest-free loan for the next crop.

She said the state government was responsible for the sufferings of the farmers. Wondering whether the people''s representatives were there at all, she said it was due to the irresponsibility of the Irrigation Consultative Committee (ICC) that the water management has been a failure. The failure of ICC has put the farmers to hardship. No leader has said anything about the sufferings of the farmers, she added.

Secretary of KRRS K. Boraiah said the officials had wasted over 12 tmcft of water which would have supported the crops till the end of June last, had the ICC managed it well. He demanded that the ICC resume the practice of letting water to the tail-end of the canal before taking care of the fields on the upper bank.

President of the district unit of KRRS Muddegowda, Ramakrishnaiah, Lingappa, Nagaraju, Venkatesh and Jagadish were present at the press conference.

24,Predator attacks increase in Kandivli,"Mumbai: Just above the slum-covered slopes of the Kandivli hills, the trees have withered brown under the glowering summer sun.

The night breeze offers some respite from the heat but Naushanya Hawle and his family have taken to sleeping inside their tiny, sweltering mud hut anyway.

Mr Hawle, a 55-year-old adivasi who has lived just inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park for most of his life, does not intend to lose his tiny grandchildren to the terror now stalking the edge of this wilderness. In the last five months, at least four children in the area have been attacked by leopards from the park. Three have died.

Mr Hawleâ€™s daughter, Hiru, has stopped sending her children to the local balwadi, a kilometre away. â€œThey return only by 2 or 3 p.m. through the forest,â€™â€™ she explains. Her friend, Gula Babu, lost her seven-year-old daughter Radha one March evening.

Although occasional leopard attacks have been a fact of life in the areas bordering the national park, the last year has seen ten incidents, the highest ever in a year. Deputy forest conservator A.R. Bharati attributes this to the demolition of slums in Malad and Kandivli. â€œBefore, the whole area was thickly populated and well-lit, so the leopards stayed away. Now almost 50,000 hutments have gone, and the shanties are sparse and isolated,â€™â€™ he said.

The slums have been demolished in the last two years in accordance with court orders in a continuing public interest litigation. The petitioners contend that the slums covering the hills in Malad, Kandivli and Goregaon illegally occupy 500 hectares of forest land within the periphery of the national park.

For some slum dwellers, struggling against eviction, the attacks portend something more sinister. â€œIs there money to demolish slums but none to feed the animals?â€™â€™ asks Rajan, resident of Damu Nagar. A 11-year-old girl was attacked and killed in February near Rajanâ€™s house, and his own dogs have frequently been snatched. He believes the attacks are part of the strategy to get slum dwellers off the land.

But Mr Bharati dismisses these suspicions. â€œAre the leopards trained dogs?â€™â€™ he asks. â€œThere are certain organisations poisoning the minds of the people.â€™â€™

For forest officials and environmentalists, such attacks are the inevitable, if tragic, outcome of having a piece of wilderness sitting in one of the largest cities in the world. â€œMan-animal conflicts are common when there is intensive development near a protected natural reserve,â€™â€™ says wildlife expert Sunjoy Monga.

The attacks can be traced to the late â€˜70s, when slums first started coming up on the parkâ€™s boundaries, and the late â€˜80s, when the number of stray dogs rose after the BMC stopped catching them, he said.

Since the leopardâ€™s natural preyâ€”wild boar and deerâ€” are thin in the park, the feline looks for dogs and poultry in the slums that border the park. Such easy, ample prey has led to an increase in the predator population.

There are an estimated 40 leopards in the 104 square kilometre park, an exceptionally high figure for the land area. Mr Bharati denies that there is a shortage of prey for leopards in the park. â€œEven if we increased the prey population, the animals would go out for the easy prey on the fringes,â€™â€™ he claims. Still, breeding prey like wild boar is both difficult and expensive, he says.

But even the adivasis, whose tenure is more secure than that of the slum dwellers, say that forest officials are not doing enough to protect humans. â€œThey even told us that we would be fined if we harmed the leopards,â€™â€™ says Hiru angrily. â€œI donâ€™t understand. Thereâ€™s a penalty for killing animals but none for killing small children.â€™â€™ For their part, forest officials say that they are under pressure to trap the leopards, even though it is an offence to do so under the Wildlife Protection Act. â€œThe upholders of the law are being asked to break it,â€™â€™ says Mr Bharati.

Environmentalists believe that the solution lies in reducing garbage and slums on the boundaries of the park and increasing food within. â€œBut even then, attacks will only be minimised not eliminated,â€™â€™ says Mr Monga. For the leopard attacks, say experts, are only one symptom of a larger conflictâ€” sustaining a first-class forest within the pressures of an expanding megalopolis.
