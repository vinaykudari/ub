2,2 held for printing fake govt documents,"PATNA: The city police have claimed to have busted a gang of criminals allegedly involved in printing fake government documents such as non-judicial stamp papers, notary stamp and other papers such as court fee. The police have arrested two persons, Pathu Basakh and Jawahar Bhagat, in this connection.

On Friday night, a police team led by Town DSP R K Dubey raided a house located in Langar Toli area under the Kadamkuan police station and seized court papers including notary tickets of Rs 5 denomination numbering about 600 and registry stamps estimated at Rs 7 lakh. The registry stamps were of Rs 5 and Rs 1,000 denominations. The seized papers are valued at Rs 7 lakh in the present market.

According to Dubey, the kingpin of the gang is yet to be arrested. He said the raid was conducted during the course of police operation to locate the gang involved in Fridayâ€™s incident of bomb explosions in a few shops situated on Nala Road. Dubey disclosed that the seized papers were kept inside a number of books available in one of the rooms on the premises of the raided house.

The officer-in-charge of the Kadamkuan police station, Karm Lal, said one of the two arrested persons is an active member of Dina Kurmi gang suspected to be involved in the bomb explosion incident.

Earlier, police recovered such fake court papers at least on four occasions in the past from areas under different police stations.

However, police investigation into these cases could not locate the sources of supply of such papers in various parts of the state. Moreover, the registration department, despite expressing serious concern over the seizure of such papers in the past, has so far not bothered to launch any operation to detect the gang of criminals active on the premises of various civil courts of Bihar.

Talking to mediapersons, Parthu Basak denied his involvement in supply of these papers.

3,CM appeals for peace as pre-poll violence continues,"KOLKATA: As pre-poll violence continued unabated in the state, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met top officials on Saturday to assess the situation on the eve of the panchayat elections.

The meeting, attended by chief secretary Sourin Roy, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and director general of police Dinesh Vajpai, took stock of the situation in the â€œsensitiveâ€� districts. Of the 17 districts going to polls on Sunday, Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar have been marked super-sensitive. These are strongholds of militant outfits such as the Peopleâ€™s War and Kamtapur Liberation Organisation.

Several other districts have earned the â€œpolitically sensitiveâ€� tag due to widespread clashes between the Left Front and Opposition supporters as well as among the Front partners. According to IG (law & order) Chayan Mukherjee, 19,527 of the 44,186 booths have been identified as sensitive.

The pre-poll violence has so far left at least 27 dead and hundreds injured. The police, however, put the death toll at nine. Though over 1.5 lakh homeguard, police and paramilitary personnel have been deployed for the polls across 317 police stations, Opposition parties as well as Front members fear large-scale intimidation by CPM cadres on polling day.

The campaign has seen some ugly incidents, including attacks on Union minister Tapan Sikdar and state ministers Biswanath Chowdhury and Amar Chowdhury. All alleged that the culprits were CPM activists.

The Trinamul Congress and its ally BJP have alleged that 23,000 of their candidates were prevented from filing nominations by the CPM. The latter, however, denied the charge and said the parties had failed to put up candidates because of their weak political base.

In the pre-election drive, the police arrested 7,000 people and confiscated 150 firearms, 200 rounds of ammunition, 130 bombs and 14.5 kg of explosives. Late on Friday, the stateâ€™s border was sealed by the Border Security Force to prevent escalation of violence.

Sensing the simmering tension in the districts, Bhattacharjee appealed to political parties and the electorate to ensure free and fair polls. â€œThe state machinery and the police are fully prepared for the elections,â€� he said.

Over three crore voters are expected to exercise their franchise to choose their nominees out of 1,38,774 candidates. Of them 1,17,050 are contesting in gram panchayats, 19,354 in panchayat Samitis and 2,370 in zilla parishads. More than 6,000 candidates have already won the poll uncontested, most of whom belonging to the CPM.

4,Pak should convince infiltration has ended: India,"NEW DELHI: India has firmly told the US that Pakistan had to convince the world that it had stopped cross-border terrorism for an Indo-Pak dialogue to begin, highly placed sources said on Sunday, a day after US Secretary of State Richard Armitage concluded his talks with the Indian leadership.

Refusing to accept Washington''s argument that it did not have any clout with Islamabad, Indian leadership, including Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, reportedly told Armitage that ""there is no way Pakistan would not accept US diktats as it had done in the case of fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan"". The clout was also evident in the handing over of 500 al-Qaeda men to the US, they said.

""Pakistan cannot disregard what you say, as they are so dependent on you"", Advani is believed to have told Armitage, who met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other Indian leaders on Saturday after coming here from Islamabad, where he talked with the Pakistani leadership.

It was pointed out to Armitage that Pakistan had not taken any action on India''s list of 20 terrorists and criminals so far, sources said.

While Islamabad said some of the these 20 wanted men were Pakistani nationals, the rest of them should be handed over to India immediately, they said, adding these 20 people were fugitives who had committed crimes in India and worldwide alert notices had been issued by the Interpol against them.

Taking exception to recent statements by some US officials that the Kashmir issue should be resolved first to end cross-border terrorism, the Indian leaders pointed out to Armitage that US President George W Bush had categorically stated after 9/11 that terrorism was an evil and there was no question of any political issue justifying it.

Stating that India had wrested from the US the initiative to create world opinion against terrorism, Advani told the US official that New Delhi wanted Islamabad to make tangible moves first to establish peace and create conducive atmosphere for the talks to begin.

This is the third time peace effort was being initiated by India and the message had gone across to the international community that New Delhi was in no hurry this time. ""It is a reaffirmation of our efforts and intentions towards peace and friendship,"" the sources said.
