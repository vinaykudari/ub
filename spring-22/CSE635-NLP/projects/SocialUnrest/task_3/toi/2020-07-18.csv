He has been remanded to judicial custody till July 30. Jagera, a controversial figure,who has enjoyed patronage of both the Akalis and the Congress, currently held the post of the chief of Gurdwara Mastuana Sahib at Dugri. Sources said Jagera had sent Amarjit Singh, one of the granthis, on a night duty to recite prayers at a Akhand Path.

Jagera then asked the granthi''s wife, Sukhwinder Kaur (25), a mother of two children who lived in the gurdwara complex, to bring him water and then raped her. Sources said Amarjit, who had possibly forgotten something, came back and heard his wife shouting. He climbed over the complex wall and caught hold Jagera. Amarjit and other members of the gurdwara then beat up the accused before handing him over to the police.

An FIR was registered under sections 376 of IPC at around 2 am at Model Town police station. Jagera had also been in news in regard to the dispute over the land of gurdwara Mastuana Sahib. Sources also alleged that Jagera had illegally taken over a house in Lohara village in Gobindsar colony, which was originally owned by a village sarpanch and was then bought by a terrorist Sukhwinder Singh.

When Sukhwinder was killed in a police encounter in 1992, his house was in the custody of the police. Later in 1998, during the Badal regime, Jagera, a close associate of the former CM, had taken over the house, alleged sources.

The special petition had been filed by principal of the college S Tangri with the NCTE in June this year for grant of more seats. The additional seats in the college could be made possible after the appointment of a dozen regular faculty members through UPSC this session.

Earlier in 1997, the seats in the college had been reduced from 300 to 200 as less faculty members would not make it possible for the college to maintain the UGC''s requirement of 1:10 teacher pupil ratio.

2,'Release Kabini water for farming',"MYSORE: Members of the Kabini Raitha Hita Rakshana Samithi have demanded that officials participating in the meeting of Kabini Irrigation Advisory Committee on Saturday, should take a decision to release water to farmers immediately.

Addressing reporters on Friday, chairman of the Samithi, Kurubooru Shantakumar said, every year, water from Kabini to the agricultural land was released on July 25. It should have been done this year also.

Water should be released through the left and right canals, Hullahalli and Rampura channels as agricultural activity suffered for the last two years due to water scarcity. He added, this year, the water level in the reservoir would touch 75 feet as on Saturday.

Centre flayed: Hassan MP G Puttaswamy Gowda said he would fight against the Centre for its step-motherly attitude towards the state while releasing funds and food grains under the drought relief programme.

He told reporters here that he would raise the issue during the forthcoming parliamentary session and also approach the ministry concerned for additional funds and grains. He said the Centre had also neglected the schemes and demands of the state in all respects.

He condemned the BJP leaders in the state for blaming the state government of misusing food grains. He criticised the Centre for not settling crop insurance claims of farmers.

3,Geelani questions Ansari's election,"SRINAGAR: Estranged Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani on Friday questioned the election of Maulvi Abbas Ansari as the new APHC chairman and indicated he would form a new party.

Geelani said the Hurriyatâ€™s executive did not meet the constitutional obligations while electing Ansari as head of the 23-member group on July 12, 2003.

He said the Jamaat-e-Islami did not attend the meeting and another prominent leader Yasin Malik was represented by some other party activist. The constitution of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) demands that all the executive members be present.

He also regretted Ansariâ€™s decision to give Sajjad Loneâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Conference a clean chit.

Geelani wanted the party out of conglomerate for allegedly flouting a boycott and participating in last yearâ€™s assembly elections. Stating that election politics has no scope in the APHC, Geelani claimed that JKLF leader Yasin Malik and former Hurriyat chairman Abdul Gani Bhat informed him about the Peopleâ€™s Conference having participated in the polls.

4,BJP executive calls for faster disinvestment,"RAIPUR: The BJPâ€™s national executive, at its meeting here on Friday, appreciated the progress made in disinvestment of government sector undertakings and asked for faster progress.

The economic resolution, moved by Union commerce minister Arun Jaitley and seconded by disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, was adopted with minor amendments.

The best is yet to come in the economic sphere, says the resolution. Indian brands need to boost their competitive edge. Reforms, it said, were needed in agriculture, manufacturing and services sectors.

Jaitley said the NDA coalitionâ€™s reform policies, such as disinvestment, are now being implemented by state governments ruled by Left parties and the Congress. Chhattisgarh was the best example, he said, where the Congress government opposed disinvestment of BALCO, but has closed a majority of public sector undertakings.

5,Amnesia plagues govt's Aids message,"HYDERABAD: â€œBreak the silence, talk about Aids,â€™â€™ exhorted chief minister Chandrababu Naidu while launching the Aids prevention campaign in Andhra Pradesh last November, amidst much amusement.

To give more thrust to the campaign, a huge condom was displayed on the premises of the Assembly during the last winner session. But the government had woken up to the reality that HIV/Aids was spreading at an alarming rate in the state much before â€” in May 2002 to be precise â€” and issued a curious government order. The GO (Ms No.228) directed all ministers, government secretaries and other senior officials to compulsorily talk about HIV/Aids for 5-10 minutes at all public or official meetings they attend, irrespective of the nature of the meeting.

It was also decided by the government, after much brainstorming within the cabinet and discussions with NGOs working in the field, to put up hoardings and banners on Aids campaign at all meetings organised by the government. For a few days, there was â€˜Aids talkâ€™ all over the state, by all and sundry. But none broke the silence. Slowly but surely, the programme started losing steam and today it has reached a stage where not many ministers and secretaries even remember that such a GO exists.

Tourism secretary Chandana Khan was more forthcoming when she said, â€œFrankly I have forgotten about it, but the tourism department has consistently tried to incorporate the Aids campaign into the programmes undertaken by it.â€™â€™ Indicative of the impracticability of the GO, not even one of the several public functions happening every day, attended by ministers and officials, talk about HIV/Aids.

Most recent example of this would be the public meetings jointly attended by tourism minister T Srinivas Yadav and Chandana Khan on July 14 for the inauguration of Tourism and Hospitality Training Centre. Even during the 19th round of Janmabhoomi programme, there was no focus on HIV and Aids. Despite evidence to the contrary, excise minister Tammineni Sitaram maintains that the GO is being followed without any deviation. When asked about the same, Andhra.

6,HC tells govt to improve education,"PATNA: A division bench of the Patna High Court, comprising chief justice R S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh, on Friday reiterated its earlier order to the state government to impart education in schools in Bihar in accordance with constitutional provisions.

This case had been started suo motu by the High Court.

The additional advocate general, S K Ghosh, said that teachers have been pos-ted in schools. On this, M P Gupta, the lawyer and secretary of Council for Protection of Public Rights and Welfare, said that the state government''s claim was false as the records available in the high court made it clear that 5,000 high schools were without headmasters and 34,000 posts of teachers were vacant.

He gave the example of some schools in the state capital which lacked classrooms and other infrastructure, and lack of amenities like drinking water and toilets.

8,LF govt patronising CESC at SEB's cost: Trinamul,"KOLKATA: The Trinamul, back in the West Bengal Assembly on Friday, accused the state government of patronising the CESC at the expense of the West Bengal State Electricity Board and consumers and compromising power sector reform.

Power minister Mrinal Banerjee, however, argued that efforts to dilute the CESCâ€™s monopoly in greater Kolkata and Howrah would lead to a â€œchaosâ€�. Admitting that the CESC was a â€œdefaulterâ€� and still had Rs 500 crore outstanding to the SEB, he maintained that a â€œschedule of paymentâ€� had been worked out.

â€œBut the CESC may lose business if a new company is allowed to operate in its command area and offer power at lower price to the bulk or industrial consumers. In that case, CESC or WBSEB will not find it a viable business catering to small consumers and stop supply. This will lead to a chaos,â€� argued the minister.

Replying to the debate on the power budget, Banerjee made it clear that cross-subsidy in power tariff, meant to facilitate domestic consumers, would be phased out.

Maintaining that the states would have to go by the new Electricity Act passed by the Centre, he said the WBSEB would be restructured to make it cost-effective. Separate agencies would be floated to handle transmission and distribution of power. However, unlike in many other states, the Left Front government would not hand over the transmission and distribution to private companies, he said. An expert committee has been set up to formulate the means of restructuring of the WBSEB.

Earlier, Opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee complained that CESC patriarch RP Goenka accompanied CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to Italy while his company owed Rs 1,025 crore to the WBSEB. Trinamul veteran Sougata Roy questioned why the government was dragging its feet on inviting other private power companies to operate in CESCâ€™s command area although the new Act had opened the possibility.

â€œThis will curb the CESCâ€™s monopoly, lower the tariff and better the service,â€� he commented, asking why the government had kept silent after the CESC shelved its Balagarh power generation project. â€œThey found that buying power from the SEB and selling it to consumers was more lucrative than power generation,â€� he commented.

9,Three injured in group clash,"PATNA: Three persons were injured when two different groups of villagers exchanged fire at Rally village near the Pandark police station on Friday.

When contacted, DSP (Barh) said land dispute is the reason behind the incident. According to him, both groups belong to the Pal community. He said three persons received splinter injuries in the incident. All injured persons have been admitted to Barh hospital.

An FIR against six persons, including one Vinod Pal, has been lodged with the Pandarak police station in this connection. Police are investigating the case, the DSP said.

Girl traceless: The police are learnt to have sought help from Punjab police to trace an 18-year-old girl, Priti Kumari alias Ruby, a resident of Gardanibagh area. Earlier, the family members of the girl lodged an FIR against three persons on the charges of ""Kidnapping"" the girl. A team of Patna police was sent to Ludhiana to trace one Raju, who is one of the three accused persons in this case. ""This appears to be case of elopement,"" said a police officer of the Gardanibagh police station on the basis of preliminary investigation.

Other two accused persons have already been arrested by the police and sent to jail in this connection.

Meanwhile, a group of people, including RJD MLC Bhola Prasad Singh and JD(U) MLC Tanveer Hasan, took out a ""Nagrik March"" in Patna in order to create awareness among people about the rise in crime in the state and the failure of the government in containing

10,Uproar in House over minister's remarks on JP,"PATNA: The proceedings in the state assembly was disrupted on Friday following remarks made by former state Congress president and medical education minister Shakeel Ahmed on the JP-led agitation in 1974.

The House was adjourned twice as the opposition members demanded an unconditional apology from the minister for the â€œderogatory remarksâ€� made against the late Jaya Prakash Narayan. The minister, however, denied having made any derogatory remarks against JP.

At the end of the day, the Speaker, Sadanand Singh, called the leaders of the opposition parties and asked them to listen to the tape of the proceedings to prove that Shakeel had not used the word â€œfascistâ€� to describe JP.

At the start of the zero hour, Ram Pravesh Rai of the BJP read out a call attention notice pointing out that the CM Rabri Devi and RJD chief Laloo Yadav had announced that those who had participated in the JP-led agitation would be given pension like freedom fighters. Rai demanded that the government should fulfil its promise. Ahmed stood up and stated that he was against the move. â€œThe people rejected the JP agitation and in two years they reinstalled Indira Gandhi in power,â€� he said. This led to a furore with BJP members, led by Ashwini Choubey, trooping into the well. Even as the Speaker, Sadanand Singh, declared that he had expunged the remarks from the proceedings of the House, the opposition members demanded an apology from the minister.

The Speaker adjourned the House till the post-lunch session. Even outside the House, a heated discussion was witnessed between Ahmed and a group of opposition MLAs. The minister defended his statement while the opposition maintained that he would have to apologise if he wanted the House to run. â€œThe minister had termed the JP agitation as the one which had fascist forces,â€� said Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha of the BJP. He wondered how the RJD, which had so many products of the JP agitation, including Laloo Yadav, remained silent at the derogatory remarks. The Speaker held a meeting where it was agreed that the minister would clarify his stand.

When the post-lunch session started, the opposition members stormed into the well of the House and raised slogans.

Deputy Speaker Bhola Prasad Singh persuaded them to resume their seats. Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha, Upendra Kushwaha (Samata Party), Ganesh Prasad Yadav (JD-U), Ram Sewak Hazari and others demanded an apology from the minister.

Ahmed said: â€œI have only stated the fact. I am ready to quit if the House proceedings show that I had made any derogatory remarks against JP.â€� The deputy Speaker read out the proceedings of the House in which Ahmedâ€™s remarks had been expunged. He said that the chair would further investigate the matter and ask the minister to tender an apology if it was found that he had used derogatory remarks.

11,Sharad Pawar rules out alliance with Congress,"BHOPAL: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar is still not ready to accept Sonia Gandhi as Prime Minister or leader of a ruling coalition. The Congress after a congregation in Shimla earlier this month had officially opened its doors to like-minded, secular political parties for a coalition with AICC president Sonia Gandhi as leader for the upcoming general elections next year.

Replying to the Congressâ€™ invitation, former Congress leader Sharad Pawar said that there is no change in his earlier stand on the issue of Sonia Gandhiâ€™s foreign origin and the â€˜questionâ€™ of the NCPâ€™s participation in such a coalition at the Centre headed by the AICC president â€œsimply does not ariseâ€�.

â€œAs of today, it is unnecessary to even discuss such an alliance with the Congress. I see no such picture of a coalition with the Congress in the Centre. The Left parties have decided to remain equidistant from both the Congress and the BJP prior to the general elections,â€� Pawar explained at a press conference here on Saturday morning.

â€œJanata Dal secular has also refused to have a coalition with the Congress. When an alliance has to be decided, we ought to first weigh the alternative. What is the alternative that we will give to the people of this country with such a coalition?â€™â€™ Pawar added.

Regarding the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, he argued: â€œIf there is a coalition, the Congress will be just one political party. In an alliance, there may be ten parties. The leader of the coalition will be a joint decision of all the parties, not just one. The Congressâ€™ declaration about their leader heading the coalition is only their internal decision. That cannot be a compulsion on other political parties.â€�

Congress leaders in Shimla had claimed that since the Congress will have the maximum number of seats in case of a coalition, it is but obvious that Sonia Gandhi as leader of the party with majority seats would be heading the government. Sharad Pawar, however, argued otherwise. â€œWhen Deve Gowda became Prime Minister, he had only 17 MPs. I K Gujral and Chandra Shekhar too were Prime Ministers heading a coalition but their parties were not the ones with maximum numbers in the alliance,â€™â€™ Pawar said.

â€œSo far as I am concerned or my party, we have not changed our stand on that issue. I have no regrets having been expelled from the Congress. I am relieved that there is no scope for any rethinking,â€� he concluded.

13,Advani may take charge of BJP for 2004 elections,"RAIPUR: A significant change in the BJPs constitution has fuelled speculation that Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani may be heading back to the party organisation to lead the party to the next general elections.

On Friday evening, the BJP amended its constitution to allow a member to hold the post of president for more than one term, but not consecutively, when it accepted the recommendations of the O P Kohli committee.

The speculation comes in the wake of two recent events : One, the Prime Minister''s annoyance with party president M Venkaiah Naidu who, he felt, had placed a question mark on his leadership when he was abroad at a G-8 meeting by announcing that the BJP would project Vajpayee and Advani equally in the next general elections, the first as Vikas Purush and the latter as Lahau Purush.

At that time, the overwhelming feeling in the BJP was that Vajpayee, who is known to have a long memory, would not forgive him, and Naidu''s days as president were numbered.

Two, at the felicitation function that Naidu organised for the PM to make peace with him, after the latter returned from the foreign tour, Vajpayee had stunned all his listeners when after declaring that the party and government had grown in self-confidence under his leadership, and that he was neither ``tired or retired, he announced that Advani would lead the BJP to victory in the next polls.

At that time, a visibly embarrassed Advani looked on as Naidu rushed to the podium to stress breathlessly that Vajpayee was not just his and Advani''s leader, but also that of the NDA and the nation.

Later, Naidu tried to explain away the PMs statement by saying it did not mean that there would be a change of leadership, only that Advani would be in charge of organisational matters.

Friday''s change in the constitution could make the PMs stated desire as interpreted by Naidu at that time a reality by putting an official stamp on what he has been doing in an informal capacity, party sources said.

Interestingly, officially, too, the party''s functionaries on Saturday chose to dodge a direct reply on whether Advani would be heading back to the party organisation.

Party general secretary Pramod Mahajan, when asked whether Advani could become president again, said, ``Both Vajpayee and Advani can become president again. But did he rule out the possibility of Advani becoming president again? ``I am not ruling out the possibility of anyone becoming president, but my realistic assessment is that Naidu will be made president in November 2003.

Naidu was not ``elected president as he merely replaced Jana Krishnamurthy in mid-course.

The other reason being cited as a reason for Advanis possible return to the party is the fact that the party''s experiments with Bangaru Laxman and Jana Krishnamurthy did not work well, and even Naidu is perceived by many as not being weighty enough to lead the party in a critical election year. Advani''s experience makes him a better bet as president, the PM feels, sources said.

Advani had been president for two consecutive terms of two years each in the late 1980 and early 1990s. Thereafter, the constitution was amended in 1999 in Chennai to allow a member only one three-year term. And it was during Advani''s presidency that the party grew from two to 89 seats in 1989 Lok Sabha and thereafter prospered after he undertook his Ramrath yatra in 1990.

14,Readmission will allow contesting of polls: MSU,"VADODARA: Student leaders of MS University, who had failed in their last examination, breathed a sigh of relief after the committee appointed to look into the rules for elections decided that students would be allowed to contest elections this year even if they take readmission.

The rule barring students taking readmission from contesting polls will now be applicable next year.

In a dramatic turn of events, the election committee held a meeting on Saturday afternoon to discuss the norms for the studentsâ€™ union and association polls. Even as the student leaders were contemplating the future course of action if the norm was implemented, the committee decided that the rule would not be implemented this year.

Student leaders were in a mood to conduct a major agitation on the issue as the committee had earlier discussed that students who took readmission in a different course would not be allowed to contest the polls. The move was made after it had come to light that leaders did not take studies seriously and failed in the exams. Later, they took readmission in another course to contest the polls.

Sources in the committee said that the rule would not be implemented this year as the results of the last examination were already declared. ""Now, we know who passed the examination and who failed. This raises suspicions that we might be trying to bring in the rule to ensure that some leaders who failed are not able to contest the polls,"" a member of the committee said.

Interestingly, a couple of committee members themselves had raised objections to the move. They had argued that it could raise legal complications and also that it should not be implemented this year as it would seem that some particular leaders were being targeted by the administration.

Commenting on the issue, former faculty of science general secretary and a prominent student leader, Sai Dhekane, said, â€œThe committee''s decision is welcome. Our only contention was that it seemed as if a particular lobby was working against some student leaders to spoil their chances in the ensuing polls. That has been taken care of.â€�
