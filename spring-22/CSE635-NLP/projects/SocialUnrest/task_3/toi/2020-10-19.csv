2,"JNU debates with gusto, a pinch of salt","NEW DELHI: It''s more of a festival than an election event! This remark made by a bemused senior seemed to sum up the mood of the night. The event was the much awaited ""presidential debate"", the election high point marking the end of campaigning at the Jawaharlal Nehru University students'' union elections.

Drum beats, tambourine rolls and loud cheering, the mood was unambiguously festive, rather than fiery as the crowd thickened at Jhelum lawns, the venue for Saturday night''s event.

When it came to slogans, it was perhaps comic creativity at its spontaneous best. There were some who got confused and found themselves cheering for the opposite camp, till silenced by their party members!

The venue was packed by 10.30 pm, and though it began an hour late, the debate, was no less a show in itself. Speakers talking in a typically ""political"" style, vocal party support, and a highly ""enthusiastic"" audience, the debate had all the ingredients for good entertainment.

So began one speaker with much gusto, ""Our country has been enslaved by the... the...the...err"" The pause for frantic recollection was of course long enough for the audience to burst out cheering and hooting!

Next came on stage one gentleman claiming with great fire, ""humne sirf naare nahi lagai, seene pe goliya khai hain (we have not just shouted slogans but faced bullets on our chests)."" Pat came a cheeky reply from one smart alec in the audience, ""dikhao dikhao (show, show)"" and the audience was in splits once again.

5,AP govt to hawk its 'tracking' software,"HYDERABAD: The state government seems to be straying into the software business to fortify its image as the IT capital of the country. A software has been developed to monitor the performance of government departments, a latest addition to state''s IT ware, and plans are being made to patent and market it to other state governments.

6,Land acquisition employees without salary since May,"BATHINDA: For about 100 employees of Land Acquisition Collector and Military Land Acquisition (MLA) offices at Jalandhar, Bathinda, Patiala and Ferozepur, Diwali will be without sheen and glitter. Yet to receive their salaries since May, land acquisition officials have urged director general, defence estate, New Delhi for its early release.

""We are finding it very difficult to meet our day-to-day necessary requirements. This is virtually a black Diwali for us. We are raising loans to keep our hearths burning,"" the employees wrote in a letter to the director general.

Officials said that employees of Military Land Acquisition offices, which are situated at Bathinda, Patiala and Ferozepur, and Land Acquisition Collectors at Jalandhar are given their salaries after budget allocation by the defence estate officer (DEO). But as no budget has been allocated for the last six months, so all employees are without salary.

About one month ago, Chandigarh DEO visited Bathinda Military Land Acquisition office for inspection. At that time the employees urged him for release of their salaries by according the sanction, but to no avail. While the DEO could not be contacted, the employees in the department said that delay in release of the salary was due to lack of coordination between the defence ministry and the Punjab government.

All officials working in the land acquisition offices over the state are employees of Punjab government but their salaries are reimbursed to the state government by the ministry of defence for working on their behalf.

Sources said this time as there was no reimbursement of the salaries by the defence ministry for some technical reasons, the state government did not release their salaries.

7,BJP to fight impending polls alone: Naidu,"PATNA: BJP national president M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said that the BJP would go it alone in the general elections in the five state assemblies to be held on December 1.

Talking to mediapersons here, Naidu claimed that the BJP would capture power in four out of these five states. He ruled out the possibility of his party changing its chief ministerial candidate in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Delhi after the elections.

With regard to the next Lok Sabha elections, the BJP president said that PM Vajpayee would continue to be prime ministerial candidate of the NDA. ""It will be NDA government''s five years versus Congress'' 47 years of rule. Congress president Sonia Gandhi will have to explain to the people as to why 40 per cent people were still illiterate, why a large section of the population is still below the poverty line (BPL) and why her party failed to remove unemployment despite being in power for 47 years at the Centre,"" Naidu said.

Naidu, however, made it clear that the BJP was dead against an outsider becoming the prime minister of India. ""Only a real Indian can be the PM of India,"" he asserted. He said that Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot had gone on record saying that only a native of Rajasthan can be the chief minister of the state and Chhatisgarh CM Ajit Jogi had stated that only a Chhatisgarhiya should be the CM of the state. ""I wonder by which yardstick the Congress was then projecting Sonia as its prime ministerial candidate,"" Naidu said.

He, however, maintained that the BJP had not raised the issue of ""foreign origin"" of Sonia. Replying to a query, Naidu claimed that the NDA would retain power at the Centre in the next LS polls. There is absolutely no question of the Congress coming back to power, he said. He said that the Congress had lost heavily in the recent by-elections to the Lok Sabha and assembly seats held in different parts of the country recently. They included Sholapur and Ernakulam Lok Sabha seats, Naidu said.

Naidu strongly denied that the BJP had reached a secret understanding with Samajwadi Party supremo and UP CM Mulayam Singh Yadav on Ayodhya issue. The BJP can neither share power with Mulayam nor it would ever reach an understanding with Mulayam, he said. He, however, said that the BJP strongly favoured the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya either through consensus or by court order.

Naidu said that he had directed the Bihar unit of the party to start a debate on the subject ""India is on the move, why Bihar is lagging behind"". Naidu said that he had directed the state unit to prepare documents to generate the debate involving intellectuals, professional and politicians across the state. Even the RJD leaders can participate in the debate.

8,Dhumal rules out conflict over BJP chief 's election,"CHANDIGARH: Amidst reports of intense infighting in BJP''s state unit over the election of party chief, former Himachal Pradesh chief minister and leader of the opposition in the state legislature, Prem Kumar Dhumal, said the party president would be elected unanimously.

Talking to reporters here on Sunday, Dhumal said he believed in the principal of one-man-one-post.

""I am holding the post of the leader of opposition and if need be I can step down. It all depends on party''s central leadership,"" he said.

He said in the past too, senior party leaders like Atal Behari Vajpayee and L K Advani had demonstrated their belief in this.

Dhumal said the party would contest elections to the four Lok Sabha seats on its own and said the election issues would centre around the failure of the state government and achievements of the Union government.

Commenting on the party''s prospects in view of the infighting in the state unit, he said the party had been able to win the elections in 1998 and this time too it would go to the masses as a united entity.

Dhumal said the present Congress government had lost the faith of the electorate in just seven months of its coming to power. The party, he said, had made false promises during the elections and had failed to deliver.

He said the government had imposed a 25 per cent increase in bus fares and had enforced a ban in government recruitments.

Hinting at irregularities in the recent selection of JBT teachers in the state, he said the results of 1,60,000 candidates were declared within a couple of days, whereas it took much longer to declare such results.

He said the government had been running a false campaign on corruption front against the BJP leaders whereas corruption cases had come up against the Congress leadership after investigation.

He also said chief minister Virbhadra Singh had tried to retain possession of 161 bighas of land in violation of the Land Ceiling Act.

10,Leave politics behind: Nitish,"SAMASTIPUR: Name of Pusa Road railway station, situated between Samastipur and Muzaffarpur stations of the EC Railway, has been rechristened as Khudiram Bose Pusa railway station by the railway in a bid to pay homage to the great revolutionary who sacrificed his life for the nation.

A function was organised at Khudiram Bose Pusa railway station on Sunday in which railway minister Nitish Kumar dedicated the re-christened railway station to the nation and paid rich tributes to the martyr.

13,"Ready for early polls, says MIM","HYDERABAD: The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen declared that the party was prepared to face an early general elections.

Addressing a public meeting at Tolichowki crossroads on Saturday night, MIM floor leader in the assembly and spokesperson Asaduddin Owaisi said his party always had public support. The recent Karwan assembly by-election had given the party the confidence to add more seats to its list, he added.

Owaisi ridiculed chief minister N Chandrababu Naiduâ€™s â€œsympathy-gainingâ€� campaign following the PWâ€™s recent assassination bid on him. â€œIf Naidu is under the misconception that the strategy is going to work out, then I advise him against it so that he can remain in power for couple of more months at least,â€� he said.

14,LDP's move to remove me politically motivated: Speaker,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Dismissing the charges levelled against him by the LDP Opposition which has given notice of a motion for his removal, Kerala Assembly Speaker Vakkom Purushothaman, said on Sunday it was upto the state government to recommend the convening of a session of the Assembly to discuss it.

He told reporters here the notice for removal of Speaker would be normally considered only when the House was in session. ""I have a very limited role in this exercise. It is for the Governor and the cabinet to decide on the assembly session,"" he said.

Terming the move for his ouster as political and ''not on merit,'' he denied all charges of the Opposition that he had not acted impartially and misused his post as Speaker.

""As Speaker, I have tried my best to act impartially. I have criticised even the policies of Chief Minister A K Antony in the House when it was warranted,"" he said.

He said all the points raised against him in the notice were baseless. Refuting the charge that he had campaigned for Congress candidate M O John in the recent Ernakulam bypoll, he said, ""anyway, I have not asked anyone to vote for the CPI-M candidate. As a Congressman, how can I do so,"" he asked.

15,Mayawati tightens grip on party,"LUCKNOW: What can be construed as a move to tighten her grip on the organisation, Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati has placed her trusted men on important positions. In the shake-up, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister appointed former minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Gandhi Azad as general secretaries of the BSP. Both Siddiqui and Azad have never wavered in their support to the former chief minister.

When Bihar unit of the BSP was won over by Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Yadav, Azad was sent to face the challenge posed in the neighbouring state.In fact, Azad and Narendra Kashyam, another general secretary of the BSP, are the people Mayawati is seeking opinion from to decide about the names of candidates for the states going to the poll by the end of this year.

The induction of Naseemuddin Siddiqui, who is a co-accused in the Taj Heritage Corridor project case, will bind the former environment minister to swim or sink with the former chief minister. A number of ruling partymen in the state were making efforts to win over Naseemuddin and make him an approver. His induction in the party set-up had scotched this possibility, at least, for the time being, said a BSP leader. Two other Mayawati loyalists, Goyal and Ish Singh, were also brought in on important posts to firm up her control on the policy-making body in the party, felt a party leader.

The reconstitution of the committee, said a leader, would refute the criticism that there was no democratic functioning in the party. When the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan and Chhatisgarh hold the key to Mayawatiâ€™s success as a party president, the former chief minister wants to face the battle of ballots (or EVMs) with a new image. This will also provide an occasion to Mayawati to outshine Kanshi Ram as president of the BSP.

17,Can tea gardens bail out cash-strapped govt?,"KOLKATA: In an unprecedented move that also speaks of desperation, the cash crunched West Bengal government is eyeing tea gardens in north Bengal to mop up revenue under its small savings schemes.

The state government has urged the Dooars Branch of the Indian Tea Association (DBITA) to inform all its members to encourage their respective work force in different tea gardens to invest in different small savings schemes that are available in post offices.

But unfortunately for the state, the move has come at a time when most of the tea gardens are faltering in timely payment of salary and wages to its workers.

Tea industry sources said that the state govenrment''s move has come in the wake of a drastic decline in its earnings from agricultural income tax levied on tea companies as well as in the share that the state government gets out of the central income tax.

The state government levies 40 per cent agricultural income tax on tea gardens. The revenue earning of the state government out of such tax collection has virtually become nil now as almost all companies have slipped into the red.

Besides, the state government''s share under the central income tax has also declined drastically as tea companies are currently reeling under losses.

A memo sent to the DBITA from the office of the district magistrate and collector of Jalpaiguri said that the ""state government is trying to envisage a growth in overall revenue augmentation. You are requested to inspire your member tea gardens to encourage their workers to deposit their savings through various small savings schemes available in post offices"".

Interestingly, the state government took the plea of curbing ""illegal money-lending activities"" in trying to garner deposits under the small savings schemes. The state government has asked DBITA to informed the government officials concerned of any incident of illegal money-lending activity.

The state government has also instructed DBITA to ensure ""efficient"" collection of professional tax from all the tea gardens.

Meanwhile, the state government has reduced the salami in case of transfer of sick gardens. The matter was decided by the state government after its land and land revenue department agreed that the definition of a sick industrial company, as defined under the SICA Act 1985, could also be applicable for tea companies to ascertain their sickness.

The state government''s decision would be applicable for transfer of all gardens within March 31, 2004.

18,Dawood planned riots in UP,"NEW DELHI: Underworld don and now a ""global terrorist"", Dawood Ibrahim, has gained a substantial ground in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat to destabilise the law and order by fomenting communal tension, according to an intelligence report.

Dawood''s D-Company colluded with the ISI to create political instability and lawlessness and was concentrating on districts along the Indo-Nepal border, the report said.

It said that the D-company continued to maintain an important office in the Himalayan kingdom which monitored the flow of drugs and weapons in Uttar Pradesh.

The areas identified by the intelligence agencies as under Dawood''s operation were Gorakhpur, Siddarth Nagar, Gonda, Baharaich, Khiri, Pilibhit and Nanital districts.

The report said that the transport agencies and truck drivers were the main targets for their job besides the local criminals who were hired to eliminate any officer who created hindrance in smuggling of drugs and arms from Kathmandu.

The declaring of Dawood as a Global Terrorist by the United States was seen as a victory of the Indian intelligence agencies, who had submitted a dossier to the US authorities during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani earlier this year.

The report, which also formed the part of dossier given to the US officials, said that Bharauch district in Gujarat was a favourite hideout for Dawood Ibrahim''s gang.

It said that the ISI used Dawood''s influence in this state to carry out its anti-national operations.
