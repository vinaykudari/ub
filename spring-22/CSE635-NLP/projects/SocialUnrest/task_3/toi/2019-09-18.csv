0,BJP to make jan jagran rally a success,"VARANASI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Venkaiah Naidu, after addressing the jan jagran rally at the Beniabag park here on Wednesday, will offer prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath temple. Senior leaders and office-bearers of the party are camping in the city to make the rally a success.

The main objective of the jan jagran rallies was to make the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a number one party in the state by mobilising the support of people of all sections of the society, Vindhyavasini Kumar, state general secretary of the party, said while talking to mediapersons here on Tuesday.

He added that the Varanasi rally would be followed by five other rallies at different places in the state. He said that the party was getting positive response from the people and workers were committed to make the Varanasi rally a historic one.

Claiming that all the preparations for the rally had been completed, he said that senior leaders too were visiting various places in Kashi Khestra appealing to the people to attend the rally which would be addressed by many senior leaders, including state chief Vinay Katiyar, national general secretary Rajnath Singh, Kalraj Mishra, Om Prakash Singh and Lalji Tandon.

Meanwhile, senior BJP leader and MLA Harish Chandra Srivastava said that by holding the jan jagran rally the party wanted to make it clear that Ram mandir, Article 370 and Uniform Civil Code were still on its agenda.

He, however, advised the local people to show restraint on the Gyanvapi issue.

1,Children’s policy on right track: Rights activists,"MUMBAI: Child rights activists have welcomed the stateâ€™s new child development policy, but say that implementing it will be the biggest challenge.

The policy was announced by Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh last week. Maharashtra is the first state in the country to frame such a policy.

Dr Nilima Mehta, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee, said the policy was a step in the right direction. â€œIn principle, it is good as there should be a documentâ€”a reference pointâ€” that clearly states what the government must and should do for children,â€™â€™ she said.

While the policy encompasses a wide range of issues concerning children, from special care for children with special needs to the rights of children who are HIV positive or have AIDS, experts point out that the state government needs to consider the finer details of the problems it plans to address.

Jeanne Davos, coordinator of the National Domestic Workers Movement, said that the challenge would be to get the guidelines to make a difference to the children it aims to reach.

For instance, the policy plans to give loans to the parents of child labourers to allow them to withdraw their children from work. But as she pointed out, â€œIn Mumbai, there are around 40,000 children below 14 who work as domestic workers. A total number of three lakh children, under 18, work in small- scale industries or are employed in similar occupations.â€™â€™

She added that once they are rescued, the main concern is that they should be brought to mainstream education with the help of â€˜bridgeâ€™ schools.

The policy will also look into the prevention and reduction of child sexual exploitation and immoral trafficking.

Sangeeta Punekar of the Forum Against Child Sexual Exploitation, said that the policy should emphasise the legal aspect of abuse and the proceedings of abuse cases should be made more child-friendly.

â€œThe trial procedures should begin immediately and the case should be handled sensitively. The victim, otherwise, is treated badly in the court,â€™â€™ she said. She added that â€œrecurring abusersâ€™â€™ should not only be punished but should also be sent to â€œtherapeutic jailsâ€™â€™.

The policy is based on the standards set by the Child Rights Convention. According to child rights experts, the government should not merely aim to meet international standards but focus on reaching out to children. â€œHow will the policy reach out to children working in a private home as a domestic worker?â€™â€™ asked Ms Davos.

Children living on the street are another category the government must reach. â€œIn Maharashtra, more than 30 per cent births are not registered,â€™â€™ said YUVA child rights coordinator Archana Shrivastav. â€œThese are children of migrant workers or belong to families living on the streets. An effort has to be made to reach out to them as these families will not go to register their childâ€™s birth.â€™â€™

The state government needs to allocate adequate funds for such efforts, and clear the backlog of birth certificates to be issued. The policy will increase the current allocation of Rs 550 crore for the different schemes for children by 10 per cent each year.

â€œThis is not enough as 90 per cent of the Rs 550 crore is spent on the Integrated Child Development Services, the â€˜anganwadiâ€™ programme for children in the age group of one to three years, on their immunisation, nutrition and other regular health needs,â€™â€™ said Ms Shrivastav.

She added that while this budget should not be cut, other age groups of children and special groups like children of sex workers and those with special needs remain largely neglected.

One of the most heartening features in the policy is the plan to set up special residential, educational and technical institutions for physically and mentally challenged children. There is only one home in the state of Maharashtra for the mentally challenged and one for the physically disabled.

2,State govt serves notice on Arun Bhatia,"PUNE: The state government has issued a show-cause notice on Arun Bhatia, commissioner, Tribal Research and Training Institute, for challenging the governmentâ€™s stand that the deaths of 22 tribal children in Wada taluka of Thane district were not caused by malnutrition.

Earlier, Bhatia had written to state chief secretary V. Ranganathan, pointing out that the presence of a wellstocked grocery in the village did not guarantee purchasing power for the tribals. The chief secretary has now served a show-cause notice, dated September 12, on Bhatia asking him to submit his say in the next seven days, failing which, appropriate action would be taken against him.

The notice adds that the government had issued the denial, and had given the factual position, after a detailed inquiry by the collector and the chief executive officer of the Thane zilla parishad. The notice also castigates Bhatia for going to the media, and asks why an inquiry should not be initiated against him.

3,Demand to review Samata's continuance in Jharkhand govt,"RANCHI: The working president of Samata Party''s Jharkhand unit Shahid Hasan on Tuesday demanded that party President Ramesh Singh Munda should review its continunace in the Babulal Marandi government as he alleged the party was ignored while taking policy decisions.

''''Munda should call a meeting to review our continuance with the government which has been ignoring a crucial partner having five ministers in the government,'''' Hasan said.

''''The party is just a mute spectator...There is virtually no NDA government in the state as the government is taking the Samata Party for granted in all policy decisions,'''' he said.

The government was taking unilateral decisions without taking the consent of ''''its biggest ally'''', he alleged.

Alleging discrimination against the minority community, he said ''''Welfare Minister Arjun Munda is chairman of the state Haj Committee, a post which should have been held by a Haji...Madarsa has been merged with an education council under a new government policy... Minority finance cooperative has been merged with the Tribal Cooperative Bank, Ranchi.''''

4,Bihar to request Centre for waiver of riot victims' loans,"PATNA: The Bihar government has decided to request the Centre for waiving bank loans of the victims of 1989 Bhagalpur riots in which about 1000 persons were killed, official sources said on Tuesday.

State Institutional Finance Secretary A Ibhrahmi said that a meeting in this regard was convened here yesterday by the departmental minister Dr Ashok Kumar and it was unanimously decided to send a proposal to the Union Finance ministry at the earliest.

The meeting was also attended by Bhagalpur district magistrate Dr Gore Lal Yadav, Finance Commissioner M N Prasad, additional Finance Commissioner K C Mishra, special secretary home Krishna Choudhry and general manager of the State Bank Of India K Sitaraman.

The decision to send a proposal to the Centre was taken in response to a question raised by CPI-M MP from Bhagalpur Subod Roy in the last Parliament session demanding waiving of loans.

Ibrahimi said different nationalised banks had distributed a loan of Rs 1.16 crore among the 843 riot victims as part of the district administration''s drive to rehabilitate them.

The loan amount with interest has now gone up to Rs 2.3 crore as none of the borrowers returned the money thinking it was a government grant.

The department secretary said it was decided at the meeting that Bhagalpur district magistrate would send the list of borrowers to the state government within a fortnight after which the government would send the proposal to the centre.

5,Gandhi hospital lacks medical equipment,"HYDERABAD: The Gandhi Hospital lacks proper equipment in many departments, including neurology, nephrology, cardiology and gastroenterology as most of them need replacement and are out-dated. As a result, patients coming for routine check-ups have to be referred to other hospitals.

Moreover, the hospital that has 1,012 beds and caters to over 900 out-patients daily, has not more than Rs 30 lakh in the Hospital Development Society Funds for replacement of equipment and has to depend on government support that is not forthcoming.

The cardiology, neurology, nephrology and gastroenterology departments are the wings that need urgent replacement of equipment. However, the heads of department (HOD) have requested the government to sanction Rs 40 crore to buy new machinery.

According to doctors at the hospital, though many patients come for simple tests and scans, they have to be referred private hospitals where charges are higher and to other better equipped government hospitals like Osmania General Hospital due to lack of equipment.

The hospital also needs dialysis machines, as most of the machines are very old. Even ventilators also need to be replaced. Moreover, the hospital does not have a CT scan machine that is essential for investigations in most departments.

According to hospital superintendent Dr C Hari Das, it is not financially feasible for the government or the hospital to replace all the dysfunctional equipment, but priority is being given to equipment that will help improve routine patient care.

Among the list that has been forwarded by the hospital management for replacement are half-a-dozen ventilators, 16 fully equipped surgical operation theatres, six dialysis machines and video endoscopes and a CT scan machine.

8,Rajiv asked Swedish govt to wind up Bofors probe: CBI,"NEW DELHI: The CBI on Wednesday told a special court that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had requested Swedish authorities to wind up the probe into Bofors pay-off after the news about alleged payment to Indian politicians was broadcast by the Swedish radio in April 1987.

""Rajiv Gandhi denied the allegations and called up the Swedish government to request that there was no need for any further investigation by them, CBI counsel N Natrajan submitted before special judge Prem Kumar.

During arguments on framing of charges in the Rs 64 crore Bofors pay-off case, Natrajan said there was a close link between Rajiv Gandhi and accused Ottavio Quattrocchi and ""inference could be drawn about his (Gandhi''s) involvement.""

Rajiv Gandhi, who also held the Defence portfolio when the 155MM Howitzer gun contract was awarded to Bofors in March 1986, was named as accused in the CBI chargesheet filed in 1999 but his name was not sent up for trial as he was no more.

When the Special Court asked Natrajan to explain how could one infer that there was a conspiracy between accused Hinduja brothers, Quattracchi, W N Chadha, Bofors company, its former chief Martin Ardbo and Rajiv Gandhi, Natrajan said Quattrocchi, Hinduja brothers and Chadha had entered into agreements for taking commission from Bofors.

The Hindujas, Quattrocchi and Chadha took money from the Swedish arms manufacturer in a clandestine manner, he alleged.

The court asked Natrajan to explain on Thursday specific allegation against each of the accused connecting them with the alleged offences.

9,India rubbishes Pak charge on J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday dismissed as ""false"" Pakistan''s charge that the first phase of elections in Jammu and Kashmir was a ""sham"", saying it showed how ""completely isolated"" Pakistan has become on the issue.

""It is a graphic illustration of how one country, Pakistan, is using not only terrorism but also falsehood as an instrument of state policy,"" an External Affairs Ministry spokesperson, Nirupama Rao told reporters when asked about Islamabad''s description of the Jammu and Kashmir elections.

""It is replete with untruths. It shows how completely isolated Pakistan is on this issue,"" she said adding the whole world has welcomed the manner in which the first phase has been conducted.

She said the very satisfactory voter turnout was an expression of faith by the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the democratic process and their rejection of terrorism, violence and intimidation.

Completely discounting what she termed as ""Pakistani propaganda"", she referred to statements emanating from Islamabad that voters had been dragged out and forced to exercise their franchise in Lolab constituency where polls have already been countermanded due to the killing of a candidate.

Rail and road traffic were more or less normal. Though Bangalore-Mysore buses plied, passengers were put to inconvenience because of several road blockades. A rasta roko in Nanjangud town, for instance, blocked traffic on the Mysore-Ooty Road for over four hours.

Agitators threw stones and damaged one KSRTC bus and police van near Silver Jubilee Park; at Vani Vilas Mohalla, miscreants attacked the BSNL office; on V.V.

A bandh was observed at Pandavapura and Kikkeri; rasta roko brought life to a standstill at Mallaiahnadoddi, Hiremarali Gate, Damadahalli, Banasamudra, Hadlee Circle, Puradoddi, Antharahalli, Chandupura, Halgur and other areas.

The bandh call given by the Kabini Raitha Horata Samiti evoked a total response in T. Narsipur. Not even a single shop or school opened, while the police said the samithi-organised procession was ``unprecedented'''' in the town''s history.

Besides burning the effigy of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalitha, the agitators submitted a memorandum to the tahsildar against the release of water to TN.

The deceased, S. Guruswamy, a member of the Ramnahalli gram panchayat, was leading a 300-strong group of farmers __ majority of them women __ from nearby villages to the dam site on Wednesday afternoon.

""I was standing about 100 yards from the bridge near Bidarhalli camp following the police lathicharge on the farmers. Around 3 pm, my brother suddenly jumped from the middle of the bridge. I too jumped and managed to save one Shivalingu. I could merely touch my brother''s hand, before he slipped into the swirling waters and drowned.""

He charged the police with resorting to lathicharge on villagers, majority of whom were women, and standing idle when four farmers jumped into the river.

14,Gilts scam: HC asks govt for action plan,"NAGPUR: Expressing its displeasure over the tardy pace of investigation by the state agency in the multi-crore government securities scam, which has badly hit several co-operative banks in the state, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has directed the state government to submit a time-bound action plan against the culprits who siphoned off the public money.

Hearing a public interest litigation filed by city lawyer G.C. Singh, a division bench of justices J.N. Patel and S.G.

Mahajan expressed its dissatisfaction over the affidavit filed by principal secretary (home) Asoke Basak, explaining the delay in filing the chargesheet within the stipulated time against those arrested in the securities scam. The petitioner has contended that the state was shielding the political bigwigs and co-operatives bosses involved in the scam.

Noting the serious allegation, the court said it would not like to form any opinion at this stage. The court further said it would like to give a fair chance to the state executive to deliberate on the matter and firm up a timebound programme of action, specifying dates by which investigation would be completed and chargesheets filed against the scam accused.

â€œIf the executive feels that itâ€™s unable to place such a plan before the court, we will infer that the respondent state lacks expertise, infrastructure and political will to prosecute the scamsters,â€� the court said in a terse warning. The court has asked the state authorities to respond on October 7.

15,PM holds meet with key ministers on divestment,"NEW DELHI: In an apparant bid to resolve the controversial disinvestment issue, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Wednesday night held an informal meeting with key Cabinet colleagues, including Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and Finance Minister Jaswant Singh.

Although none of the participants was willing to talk to reporters on the deliberations held immediately after Vajpayee chaired a meeting of the Union Cabinet, the consultations were believed to have focussed on arguments by supporters and critics in the government on disinvestment.

Among others, the meeting was attended by Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie, Petroleum Minister Ram Naik and Communication and IT Minister Pramod Mahajan.

The meeting assumes importance in the backdrop of public airing of differences by certain ministers on disinvestment issues, including privatisation of oil PSUs Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum.

It was not clear whether the controversial Rs 1,200 crore investment decision by VSNL in Tata Teleservices immediately after the telecom giant was acquired by Tatas, came up for discussion at the meeting.

The Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment had earlier this month deferred by three months a decision to sell government equity in oil PSUs in order to resolve differences on the disinvestment issue.
