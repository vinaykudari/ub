0,Villagers prevent police from arresting Simi man,"THANE: A Mumbai police team which went to a Thane village on Thursday to arrest a suspect in the Ghatkopar blast case was forced to retreat when angry villagers surrounded their vehicle.

A Mumbai crime branch team had gone to Padgha-Borivli village near Bhiwandi to arrest Sakib Abdul Hamid Nachen, an alleged activist of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi). When they arrested Nachen from his house and were taking him towards the jeep a mob of 300 people, including women, surrounded the jeep and began shouting anti-police slogans. Taken aback, the police were forced to leave without Nachen. Confirming the incident, Joint commissioner Satyapal Singh, who heads the Mumbai crime branch, said, â€œWe had just gone there to question Nachen.â€™â€™

Thane police officials say this predominantly Muslim village has several supporters of Simi. Padgha-Borivli village was the hub of Simi activities before the state government imposed a ban on the organisation in 2001. A Thane (rural) police officer criticised the Mumbai police for not taking them into confidence before trying to arrest Nachen. â€œThe Mumbai police should have sought our assistance since they are not aware of the geographical and social conditions of the district,â€™â€™ he said.

Nachen was not to be traced on Friday. The 45-year-old has a long-standing connection with Simi and spent 10 years in Sabarmati jail for conspiring with Pakistan-sponsored terrorists in India. Last week, a mob â€˜gheraoedâ€™ a police station at Kalyan after a Mumbai police team arrested an alleged Simi activist, Saifudding Karde. The police later released Karde, an active social worker.

1,US think-tank for better framework for farming,"LUDHIANA: A high powered delegation of agricultural experts of International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Washing-ton DC, has suggested development of appropriate technology, enhanced investment in science and education including agriculture, building of infrastructure and creation of new institutional arrangements for giving much needed push to agricultural development in Punjab.

During the visit to Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) on Friday, the delegation leader and IFPRI director general Dr Joachim Von Braun disclosed that agricultural diversification, agro-processing, grain marketing and a rethink on various subsi-dies were high on their agenda. Braun has al-ready held wide-ranging discussions with the chief minister Amarinder Singh at Chandigarh on Thursday in this regard. He also ad-dressed PAU faculty and interacted with its deans and directors.

IFPRI Director Dr Ashok Gulati called for exploring the policy options benefiting the farmers, consumers and the state on sustain-able basis in terms of financial and environ-mental safety. IFPRI would like to contribute its international experience in this regard, he added.

Praising the role of PAU in ushering in green revolution, Braun said his institute looked at Punjab as a very important spot in their global operations. He expressed hope that there would be better cooperation between his institute and the university.

Referring to new challenges of surplus production of wheat and paddy, vice-chancellor Dr KS Aulakh drew attention towards feasibility of growing fruits and vegetables as the state has wide range of agro-climatic environments suitable for that. He added that export potential of dairy products could en-sure big financial relief to farmers while solving the problem of storing the surplus stocks.

2,Private colleges set March 31 deadline for govt,"BANGALORE: Even as the state government is delaying a decision on seat-sharing and fee structure for admissions to professional colleges, the private college managements have given March 31 deadline for the government to find a solution to the impasse.

â€œWe have set March 31 as the last date for the government to take a decision. If the government does not announce its formula, we will go ahead with the scheme we have formulated and begin issuing advertisements,â€™â€™ a member of the association told The Times of India on Friday. The managements have convened a meeting on Monday to discuss the issue. â€œWe sent a letter to the government 10 days ago urging it to expedite its decision on the matter. With other states announcing its rules for admission, we should not be left behind,â€™â€™ he said.

Meanwhile, the cabinet meeting scheduled on Saturday to discuss the issue has been postponed. The cabinet sub-committee constituted to resolve the CET imbroglio has worked out a new formula in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment directing states to evolve a uniform fee structure.

But the committeeâ€™s solutions cannot be made public until it is placed before the cabinet, sources said. The committee has now commenced the process of collecting data from other states on resolving the issue.

3,HS student denied admit card for father's protests,"BARRACKPORE: A student of the Agarpara Netaji Sikshayatan in North 24-Parganas has been denied his admit card for the higher secondary exams by his school headmaster.

The reason: the boyâ€™s father had apparently angered the headmaster by inciting a group of guardians to write to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and school education minister Kanti Biswas accusing the headmaster of siphoning money from the school.

Left without a choice, 18-year-old Bibhas Roy has filed an FIR with the Ghola police station. Bibhas alleged his admit card for the HS exams, beginning on April 1, has been withheld by headmaster Uday Sankar Bhattacharya for no reason. In his complaint, Bibhas, a science student, said he would end his life if he is not allowed to sit for the exams. â€œOn Wednesday, my son returned from school crying and told me that everyone had received the admit card except him. The headmaster had apparently told him that the admit card would be given to him only if I withdrew the complaint,â€� Bibhasâ€™ father Bidyut Roy said.

However, school governing body secretary Asit Bhowmick said, â€œNo school can stop any student who has passed his selection test. The admit card has to be issued. There must have some technical reason like a discrepancy in the documents.

I have been told about the incident and have personally spoken to the headmaster over telephone.â€�

When contacted, the headmaster alleged the incident had been concocted around by the studentâ€™s father. â€œHe didnâ€™t attend classes regularly so, he was charged Rs 100 for short percentage as per rules. A kutchha receipt was also issued.

But his father insisted that it should be rubberstamped.

All students came and received their respective receipt, but Bibhas did not. He came with the police today and claimed his fee card was with his father,â€� the headmaster said.

4,Court stays disinvestment in Jessop case,"

KOLKATA: In a landmark judgement, the Calcutta High Court on Friday stayed the disinvestment process of the city-based Jessop and Company Limited.

Nullifying the Centreâ€™s decision to disinvest at Jessop, a single bench of Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta directed the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) to prepare fresh revival scheme for the company within three months of receiving the court order.

The order was passed following a writ petition filed by Jessop and Company Staff Association challenging the Centreâ€™s decision to disinvest its equity in Jessop to a private organisation, Ruia Coatex.

However, the court granted a stay on operation of the order for 15 days as was requested by Ruia Coatex. The court said the decision to disinvest in Jessop was not â€œin accordance with lawâ€� and that the valuation of equity transferred to Ruia Coatex was also bad in law.

The high court said the operating agency in case of Jessop, State Bank of India, did not act according to the guidelines on disinvestment. Though the court gave no direction to change the operating agency, it told BIFR to use its own discretion on retaining SBI in this case.

The high court had earlier restrained the BIFR from giving effect to the Centreâ€™s decision on disinvestment of Jessop. Subsequently it had extended the interim order of stay several times.

Counsel for Jessop Staff Association, Subrata Talukdar, confirmed the courtâ€™s verdict and said the court had turned down the Centreâ€™s prayer for â€œspecial leave to appealâ€�.

Though the Jessop Staff Association had claimed that the company belonged to the strategic sector, the court said this was not so. The Central decision on disinvestment in Jessop for a sum of Rs 12 crore to Ruia Coatex had created an uproar. The association alleged that Jessop was being given away to a private party at a throw-away price since the total assets of the company ran into hundreds of crores. Jessop has been under BIFRâ€™s scanner for a long time and the transfer of shares to Ruia Coatex needed its clearance.

The petition had contended that if the Centre took any decision before the BIFR passed any order, the application before the BIFR would become infructous.

5,Anti-US tirades spark unrest,"LUCKNOW: The bombings by Allied Forces on Iraq saw sparks fly in Uttar Pradesh on Friday.

The clarion call from Iraqi clerics appealing to Muslims around the world to protest against the US-led attacks caused some tremors in Aligarh after the Friday prayers where the police fired in the air to disperse clashing mobs. The ripples travelled down to Lucknow where police officials were on the alert to thwart any attempt to take out anti-war processions for fear that it could shatter peace.

In Aligarh, trouble began after hundreds of members of a community collected after Friday prayers in Sabzi Mandi area and began to take out a protest march against the US invasion. The procession had barely reached the hyper-sensitive Abdul Karim crossing when members of another community allegedly pelted stones on the protesters, leading to a clash. The police opened fire in the air to quell the mob before the situation turned out of hand. Though the mob dispersed, over a dozen from both sides suffered injuries in mutual brick-batting and the subsequent cane charge by the police.

Around the same time in the state capital, about 200 members of a community collected in Bazarkhala area near Katra Khurd Yaar Khan Masjid after Friday prayers and began to march towards the Vidhan Sabha Marg where they planned to stage a protest. They shouted slogans like â€œRavana ke liye Ram, Bush ke liye Saddamâ€� . It was here that the district authorities learnt about the developments in Aligarh.

Springing to their toes, DM Navneet Sehgal and SSP Anil Kumar Agarwal began to supervise the security personnel as circle officer of Bazarkhala rushed to the site from where the protest march had just begun. After long deliberations the processionists called off their agitation, but only for the day. An announcement was made on the public address system installed at a place of worship that on next Friday the protest march would be taken out, even if the administrative authorities tried to restrict the move.

6,Red Cross advised to help govt in literacy campaign,"HYDERABAD: Lauding the Indian Red Cross Society for its public welfare programmes, governor Surjit Singh Barnala on Friday called upon the state branch of the Red Cross to supplement the efforts of the state government to reach the target of 100 per cent literacy.

Addressing the 45th annual general body meeting of the state unit of the Indian Red Cross Society at Raj Bhavan, the governor, who is also the president of the IRCS state branch, said the Red Cross had always been in the vanguard to help mitigate human suffering without making any distinction among the beneficiaries and without expecting any reward or recognition. Further, Red Cross volunteers had been playing a significant role in taking up various welfare programmes for the people, he added.

Barnala said all the Red Cross district branches in the state were engaged in some or the other public welfare programme which included setting up of blood banks in all the district headquarters, organising blood and eye donation camps, and health check up camps.

The governor said literacy was another area, where Red Cross volunteers could bring about a sea change. Barnala presented awards to several office bearers of the Red Cross. Secretary to the state branch of Red Cross Dr K Rajya Lakshmi presented the annual report.

Lady governor and vicechairperson Surjit Kaur Barnala and principal secretary to the governor and vice-chairman of the society S Anwar were present.

7,Assembly incident cooked up: YSR,"HYDERABAD: Opposition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Friday told the chief minister that the ruling party members had misrepresented the facts about the Congress legislators who tried to meet Chandrababu Naidu in his Assembly chambers on April 22, 2003. Rajasekhara Reddy, accompanied by Congress legislators, called on Naidu in the Assembly. They also submitted a memorandum to him requesting the government to take up ten developments works in the constituencies of Congress legislators.

According to sources, both the leaders were in a cheerful mood. Rajasekhara Reddy remarked it was unfortunate that the chief minister had presumed that the Congress legislators were trying to break into Naiduâ€™s chambers.

Naidu replied that the Congress leaders had created tension by raising slogans and barging into the corridor. When Government whip E Dayakar Rao intervened to support the CMâ€™s remark, Rajasekhara Reddy in a lighter vein requested Naidu to remove his party whips E Dayakar Rao and Gadde Babu Rao as they consistently disturbed the proceedings in the Assembly. There were peals of laughter when Naidu promptly replied, â€œI have to suffer them more as they sit right behind me.â€�

8,Pvt employees better than govt staff: CM,"HYDERABAD: Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said on Friday that outsourcing was the best way for the development of the state as the work executed by private employees is superior to that of the government employees.

He was addressing a group of scientists on the occasion of Astronautical Society of India annual awards function at the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) here.

For instance, he said, outsourcing the work of cleaning roads in the city had paid rich dividends. While three-fourths of the city roads are cleaned at a cost of Rs 20 crore through outsourcing, the government spends as much as Rs 50 crore for cleaning the remaining one-fourths of the roads with the help of government staff.

He also said Singareni Collieries Company Limited, which was suffering losses to the tune of Rs 1,250 crore a few years ago, today after outsourcing, the company is set to notch up a profit of Rs 450 crore this year.

The chief minister said the state registered 323 per cent growth in information technology industry, while the average growth in the rest of the country is only 70 per cent.

The chief minister said India and China are the only countries in the world showing positive trends in economic growth, while the rest of the world is slowly slipping down.

Indian scientists were the best in the world, he said, adding that if only the right environment is created, India can be the future leader in science and technology.

The chief minister requested chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation K Kasturirangan to help him map the buildings in the city as many building owners are evading property tax. He also asked him to extend the services of space technology to the farm sector, water management and forecasting weather.

Kasturirangan thanked the chief minister for the support extended to the scientific community in the state.

â€œNaidu has qualities similar to a missile. He has speed, dynamism and accuracy, except the last quality that is lethality.â€� DRDL director Prahalada said. Hyderabad Central University vice-chancellor Kota Harinarayana was present at the awards function.

10,Oppn seeks govt ouster on abduction issue,"PATNA: The spate of kidnapping in Bihar rocked the state legislative assembly here on Thursday during zero hour with the opposition, mostly comprising BJP members, trooping into well of the House and demanding resignation of the government.

The matter was raised by some BJP members, with Prem Kumar pointing out that in a very short time there were eight incidents of kidnapping. The kidnapped persons included senior Nationalist Congress Party leader Salauddin, he said and charged the state government with lack of concern in the matter.

At this juncture, all the BJP members were on their feet. Levelling various charges against the government, they went into the well of the House and demanded the governmentâ€™s resignation. They raised slogans like â€œDown with Bihar governmentâ€� and â€œStop kidnappingâ€�. Leader of opposition Sushil Kumar Modi said that kidnapping in Bihar had assumed alarming proportions. The ransom money payment had touched a figure of about Rs 300 crore per annum.

Parliamentary affairs minister Ramchandra Purbey merely said that steps were being taken to free the kidnapped persons from their captors.

During zero hour, the opposition members criticised urban development minister Shri Narain Yadav for his failure to control mosquito menace in the state capital.

The minister deliberately said, â€œWhy do mosquitoes bite the BJP and Samata leaders.â€� At this, leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi quipped that â€œa separate minister is needed to tackle mosquito menace in the cityâ€�. Some members said that mosquito menace had become an all-Bihar phenomenon.

The Speaker said that nothing had been done to clean the city and control mosquito menace in the MLA flats area.

He asked the minister to get the city cleaned and check mosquito menace by sprinkling of insecticides.

11,Dutch arrests smack of economic protectionism: India,"NEW DELHI: India has reacted strongly to the arrest of Indian IT professionals in Netherlands and in London (at the behest of the Dutch authorities), saying the move ""smacks of economic protectionism"" and ""neo non-tariff barriers.""

The external affairs spokesperson said on Friday that the matter had been taken up with the Dutch government in the Hague where a demarche had been made and the issue had been taken up with the embassy here. India considered the step ``grossly unfortunate, objectionable and patently unwarranted''''.

Twelve IT professionals and their CEO were arrested on charges of visa fraud, apparently on the grounds that they required a work permit rather than a business visa for their activities.

The Indian authorities were not informed of the action being taken and nor had those arrested been allowed to contact the embassy or even a lawyer and even the consular access was being delayed.

All those arrested had perfectly valid visas and belonged to highly reputed firms that were among the top 20 Indian firms, the spokesperson said, adding that it was not the first time that they were travelling to the country. They had also clearly stated the purpose of their visit while applying for a visa.

12,Plea to simplify patent laws,"PATNA: As no educational institution in the country, not even the IITs, is imparting any training on the intellectual property right (IPR), most Indian scientists and researchers fail to secure their inventions or innovations from the international agencies which may be attempting to patent our indigenous knowledge base.

IPR has been attaining considerable significance following the ever-increasing globalisation and recent advancements in the field of information technology.

Expressing these views at a patent awareness workshop organised jointly by the Science College and Science for Society, Bihar, at the Indira Gandhi Planetarium here on Thursday, an advisor of the department of science and technology, New Delhi, R Saha pointed out that no new invention or technology can be purchased by an industry unless it is patented. More than three lakh products and innovations have been patented throughout the world in the recent times.

Elaborating the criteria for patenting, Saha said novelty, inventive step and industrial applications of an innovation were judged by the competent body before the award of IPR to the inventor.

Even things like needle, gem clip, pin, dogyâ€™s bell, coke can and Hoodia cactus plant, used as anti-obesity drug, were patented at one time or the other. Smell of a particular product is also being patented these days.

Inaugurating the workshop, science and technology minister Chandrika Rai pleaded for simplification of patent laws and creating mass awareness about IPR.

Many of our vaids and hakims had got good knowledge of curing different diseases, but failed to get their formulae patented due to ignorance. Consequently, their knowledge vanished with their death and could not be preserved for the benefit of the suffering humanity. Patna University vice-chancellor K K Jha presided.

Former PU vice-chancellor S N Ahsan, in his key-note address, pointed out that patenting in our country was governed by the Indian Patent Act, 1970.

Anand Chakravarty was the first scientist in the world to get a living organism patented following the judgement of the US Supreme Court. Bihar has tremendous potential of biotechnical innovations and hence the local scientists should try to find out those substances in various plants which were beneficial for us.Patent examiner from Kolkata B P Singh, patent attorney M Chakraborty, Kolkata IIM professor of economics Nirmal Chandra, Science College principal J Thakur, Bihar Council on Science and Technology director Amitabh Ghosh and Science for Society president K V Srinivasan also expressed their views at the workshop. S P Verma proposed the vote of thanks.

13,Thousands join anti-war rally in city,"Patna: Thousands of people from all sections of society on Thursday expressed their solidarity with Iraq.

They took out a peace march, formed human chains and launched a signature campaign to protest the British-American war against Iraq. The peace march, in which a number of social, educational and voluntary organisations of the city participated, started from the Gandhi Maidan and terminated at the Amedkar statue near the Patna High Court.

The march was organised under the banner of Patna Citizensâ€™ Anti-Iraq War March. Humlog (a citizensâ€™ forum for peace) convenor Parveen Amanullah coordinated the march.

Besides her, a number of eminent citizens of the city participated including noted surgeon Ahmed Hai, Humlog patron L Dayal, Patna Womenâ€™s College principal Sister Doris, St Michaelâ€™s School principal Father Norbert Menzes, Brother James of Loyola School, Notre Dame School principal Sister Jayshree, St Xavierâ€™s School principal Father Peter, Farhat Hasan of International School and social workers â€” Brahm Deo Narayan and Dr P Gupta.

Among the organisations which participated in the march were Humlog, Bihar Industriesâ€™ Association, Bihar Pensionersâ€™ Samaj, Gandhi Sangrahalaya, Insani Ekta Moheem, Pasmanda Muslim Mahaj, Jan Abhiyan, Ekta Manch, Prayaas Bharti and Bihar Chemist and Druggistsâ€™ Association and many others.

Besides, about seven cultural groups of the city also participated by presenting several street plays and songs based on the theme of war and imperialism.

The artists of IPTA, Abhiyan and Askhara Arts celebrated the World Theatre Day on Thursday as anti-war day raising the slogan, â€œWe will not accept slaveryâ€�.

Earlier, in the morning, human chains were formed in front of 33 schools and colleges of the city including St Xavierâ€™s School, St Josephâ€™s Convent, Notre Dame, International School, Don Bosco, St Michaelâ€™s School, Loyola School, Darbhanga House, Patna Womenâ€™s College and Kushwaha Girlsâ€™ High School.

15,Vajpayee to rule for a long time: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Exuding confidence that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would rule the country for a ""long time to come"", Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Saturday said that the NDA had removed people''s apprehensions about the longevity of coalition governments at the Centre.

""Today after completing five years and 10 days (of the NDA government) I can say with confidence that the country will be ruled under Vajpayee for a long time. He will continue for a much longer time,"" Advani said addressing an NDA rally here.

He said that when the government was formed five years ago, there were several doubts in people''s minds and they were not convinced of the smooth functioning of coalition governments at the Centre.

""Because of so many years of experience, they felt if anyone can run the government for five years, it could be only by one party,"" he said.

Complimenting Vajpayee for heading the largest ever coalition, he said that very few prime ministers in the world would be able achieve stability in running such a government and pointed out that the country had seen seven prime ministers in the last 10 years.

16,There is need for consensus on foreign policy: Vajpayee,"NEW DELHI: Dismissing Opposition charge that Government was toeing the US line on Iraq, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday asserted that his Government will not come under pressure from anyone but said there was need for consensus on foreign policy issues.

""We will take decisions independently and we will not come under pressure from anyone,"" he said while addressing an NDA rally marking the completion of five years in office of the coalition government.

The Prime Minister denied a newspaper report that US President George W Bush had asked him thrice for military support in the fight against Iraq and he had said no on all the three occasions.

""Neither have I been approached nor have I given any assurance,"" he said observing ""these reports have sought to create needless confusion.... then the Congress will say that the Government has come under pressure.""

Asserting that India did not want Iraq''s independence to be lost, he said Government has consistently held that it wanted the UN route to resolve the Iraq crisis.

The Prime Minister also resented Opposition allegation that Government had not clearly spelt out its stand on the US-led military action in Iraq, saying conveying its position effectively through diplomacy could not be faulted.

""We are told that we are not clear on our stand on the Iraq issue. We say we have made it as clear as possible,"" the Prime Minister said, adding it has been conveyed both at the UN and at the Non-Aligned Movement and also made known to several key countries.

Recalling that he had been in the Opposition for over four decades, Vajpayee said he had consistently backed the view that there must be unanimity on issues concerning foreign policy.

Stating that the Iraq issue was not a matter for scoring political points, he asked whether Congress had not been ""diplomatic"" on a number of issues when it was in power like his government did now.

17,Rift in ICHR continues as members play politics,"NEW DELHI: Amidst the recent Holi revelry, HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi released Rs 1.25 crores in history research money that had been delayed by six months. Although an equal amount is due to arrive, this has not helped cement the rift among ""Joshi''s hand picked men"", as members of Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) call each other.

Release of grants, blocked allegedly by an influential member, have got delayed projects going. But the internal differences have sharpened. Twelve of its 18 members have protested at being called names. They insist that there was nothing ""stormy"" about their meetings. Instead, in a joint statement, they appeal to the media''s ""good sense"" against spreading of ""damaging rumours"" that ""falsely target the chairman, the member secretary, and members of ICHR and in turn, the Honourable Minister, Dr Joshiji.""

There is a good deal of shadow boxing. ICHR has a web site. But there is nothing official about it. A hardline member dishes out ""damaging rumours"" against the council itself.

As has been the procedure, all 18 historians are nominated on the general council by the HRD ministry. But some claim proximity to the minister or to some other leading lights of the Sangh Parivar. This has sharpened the jockeying for control of various projects of the council and the grants and scholarships. Reports from within the council speak of a continuing tussle among the ""hardliners"" and the ""moderates"".

Part of the problem, insiders say, is resistance to a chairman from outside the national capital by ""Dilliwallas"" -- the government bureaucrats and the academics from Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia and a little distance from there, Aligarh Muslim University. Till 1990, they hogged nearly 80 per cent of funds for research, says the current chairman, MGS Narayanan.

He is from Kerala. He has been accused doing up ""a bungalow"" with computers, air conditioners et al, at government expenses. His recent decision to hold the council''s meeting in Bangalore, and not the headquarters here, has also been criticised in pamphlets and media reports.

The allegations form part of a booklet credited to one of the members, Prof Makkhan Lal. Narayanan refutes the allegations. ""I live in a two bedroom house, and I have rented for my office a small flat, which I have not renovated or decorated.""

The Rs 4000 per month rent was fixed after being assessed by the local CPWD office. ""There is nothing five star about my travel or stay, here or in Kerala or anywhere else,"" he told the Times News Network.

Narayanan alleges that one reason that has angered his critics is his making the functioning of the council transparent. A newsletter publishes the list of grants and scholarships approved and lists work done. ""My dream is to have our own premises for the ICHR, set up a library where material is computerised and digitalised and there is networking with other institutions.""

But all this, he says, can take place smoothly, ""only if academics stop going to politicians for favours.""

18,Yechuri rules out electoral alliance with Cong,"VIJAYAWADA: CPM Politburo member Sitaram Yechuri on Saturday ruled out any electoral alliance with Congress in the coming assembly elections in four states of the country.

""However, there might be local-level adjustments with Congress in areas where the CPM was weak to check the BJP,"" Yechuri told reporters here.

He was in the city to attend the funeral of veteran CPM leader Lavu Balagangdhar Rao, who died in Hyderabad yesterday.

Yechuri said the need of the hour was to build the third front as an alternative to the Congress and BJP.

""For this, left unity alone is not sufficient, but all democratic and secular forces should join hands to strengthen the front,"" he said.

Lashing out at the TDP government in Andhra Pradesh, he said it had ""failed"" on all fronts.

19,Togadia condemns Govt's pro-Iraq policy,"NEW Delhi: Disagreeing with the Government''s ""dogmatic"" policy on Iraq, senior VHP leader Praveen Togadia on Saturday said India''s economic and civilisational interest lay in adopting a pro-American stand.

Togadia, who had stirred a hornet''s nest with his earlier statement supporting US and forced VHP to disown it, charged the Government with ""repeating the Gujral doctrine"" which led to the displacement of thousands of Indians from the Gulf during the previous war.

""Foreign policy should not be dogmatic. Iraq today owes us 120 million US dollars. We have one oil well. Finally, George Bush will have his say and post-war there will be an economic boom. We should see our economic interest,"" Togadia said answering questions at a public lecture organised by the Image India Foundation.

""India''s civilisational and economic interest lies in being pro-US. We can achieve Pakistan via Baghdad, which we could not via Kargil,"" he asserted.

Togadia also suggested a ""civilisational treaty"" between Russia, US, India and Israel to counter Islamic fundamentalism.

He said infiltration from Bangladesh ranked second only in terms of priority for VHP after Ram temple and plans were afoot to build a mass movement on the issue.

20,Teachers protest new appointments,"NEW DELHI: The School of Correspondence Courses in Delhi University has witnessed much discord in the past month. Teachers have been protesting against the delay in the formation of the Campus of Open Learning (COL) and the appointment of an officer on special duty (OSD) as the school head after the acting principal resigned earlier this month.

The teachers say the appointment of the OSD is unnecessary as a director for the COL has already been appointed by the varsity. â€˜â€˜The school had an acting principal, R K Anand, for eight years,â€™â€™ said J Khuntia, School of Correspondence staff council secretary and economics teacher.

â€˜â€˜The university did not appoint a full-time principal as COL was on the cards. Now that Anand has resigned after eight years following protest by teachers, S K Vij, a professor from south campus has been appointed the head of the institute,â€™â€™ he said. The protesting teachers say this will only serve to create confusion in the functioning of the school. â€˜â€˜There is a chairperson-cum-director and an OSD. No one knows what the other is doing,â€™â€™ he added. Anita Dighe was appointed the director of COL last year.
