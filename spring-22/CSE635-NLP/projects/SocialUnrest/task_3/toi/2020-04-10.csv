0,Kadam tenders apology for violating rules,"MUMBAI: State legislative affairs minister Patangrao Kadam was on Thursday compelled to apologise to members of the state legislative assembly for violating rules and rushing to the media to announce the date for the monsoon session of the state legislature.

Mr Kadam held a press conference at Vidhan Bhavan and announced that the state assembly will convene on July 15 for the monsoon session of the state legislature.

""It is the prerogative of the speaker to announce the date for the next session. The minister has superseded the authority of the speaker and that he should be pulled up for such serious breach of authority,"" pointed out BJP member Eknath Khadse who raised the issue in the legislative assembly.

Although initially Mr Kadam declined to apologise, arguing that the announcement of the date was purely an administrative issue and he was well within his rights to declare the date, he later relented and tendered an apology.

Speaker Arun Gujrathi later prorogued the house and announced that the state assembly will meet on July 14.

1,Bihar minister's resignation has Gujarat connection,"AHMEDABAD/PATNA: An engineer employed with the Ahmedabad-Vadodara Express Highway project was arrested from Anand recently by the Bihar police in connection with a case of cheating and fraud registered at the Kotwali police station in Patna. A team of the Bihar police landed in Gujarat earlier this month with a warrant for the arrest of Atul Prakash Sinha, a civil engineer working for a private firm. â€œOur local crime branch assisted in the arrest of Sinha, who was in charge of quality control in the express highway project,â€� Anand SP BD Vaghela told TNN.

Later, in a subsequent development in the case, the Bihar state minister for excise Surendra Prasad Yadav, on Wednesday, resigned from the Laloo-Rabri-led Rashtriya Janata Dal ministry after an arrest warrant was issued against him for abducting a sub-inspector. Apparently, the minister had also accompanied the police team to Gujarat to arrest Sinha, who had been sought by the Bihar police on fraud charges.

Reports from Patna said that on their way back, instead of coming back to Patna, the minister took the Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express to Gaya last Friday, where Yadav held the engineer and the sub-inspector captive against their will at his residence. Further, Yadav and his men tortured Sinha, giving him electric shocks. The sub-inspector somehow managed to escape from his captivity after two days of confinement.

Fearing Sinhaâ€™s death due to continuing torture, the sub-inspector, who was merely identified as â€˜Ramâ€™, contacted the Gaya SP on Sunday night. Sinha, who was earning between Rs 15-20,000 a month, stayed in a rented flat in Anand town, from where he was reportedly picked up.

Sources in the Bihar police told TNN that his brother is an accused in a fraud case being investigated by the Bihar State CID (crime), while his father is said to be an accused in the multi-crore fodder scam.

A warrant has also been issued against Pappu Yadav, who also happens to be Rabrideviâ€™s brother. The Gaya police have also arrested three policemen for colluding with Surendra Yadav in illegally confining and torturing the Patna sub-inspector and Sinha.

Meanwhile, Sinha has been remanded to judicial custody until April 19, in the fraud case involving Rs 5 lakh filed by one Vinod Shankar Parasar at the Patna Kotwali on November 7, 2002. Sinha, however, said he had been living out of Bihar for the last 14 years and had no idea about the fraud case.

â€œThese speculations have been floated by vested interests, who were not party to the meeting between Deve Gowda S.R. Bommai in Delhi recently.

â€œThe modalities of talks are being worked out. The question of Murthy being given the party presidentâ€™s post does not arise now,â€� he said.

3,Minority community objects to 'random arrests' in Pandya case,"AHMEDABAD: The minority community has objected to â€œrandom arrestsâ€� of their members by various investigating agencies in recent weeks and made a representation before DG K Chakravarthi and Ahmedabad city commissioner K R Kaushik on Thursday. They were protesting against the detention of certain people in connection with the Haren Pandya murder case.

While CBI director P C Sharma stayed back on Thursday to hold high-level meetings with Chakravarthi and Kaushik, a delegation of the minorities headed by standing committee chairman Badruddin Shaikh, tried meeting Sharma to plead their case.

After vain attempts to meet Sharma, municipal corporators belonging to the minority community along with several other local residents, shot a letter to Kaushik.

The letter expressed â€œsorrow that instead of impartial inquiry into this incident, since last two, three days innocent merchants and civilians â€” especially Muslims â€” are being arrested and mentally tortured.â€�

Shaikh, chairman of standing committee of AMC, told TNN: â€œWe are shocked and distressed over the brutal murder of the former state home minister Haren Pandya. The Muslim Samaj had also demanded an inquiry through CBI in this regard and for strict punishment to be meted out to culprits, once they are nabbed. However, the current happenings is quite unfair.â€�

Shaikh said: â€œThe killers should immediately be tracked down and punished but under no circumstances should innocent people be harassed under the guise of conducting an investigation. This should stop immediately.â€�

The letter which has 18 signatories including chairman of hospital committee of AMC Taufiqkhan Pathan, Liyaqat Ghori the chairman of water supply committee in AMC, Nazneen Bastavala member of standing committee in AMC, also talks about the statement made by Pandyaâ€™s father in a condolence meeting attended by deputy PM L K Advani, CM Narendra Modi and former CM of Gujarat Keshubhai Patel.

â€œ...father of Shri Harenbhai Pandya also has stated that this is a political murder and he has made clear his suspicions that a chit will be put into some innocentâ€™s pocket and he will be shot dead in an encounter while the culprit gets away,â€� said the letter.

Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Tejinder Luthra said, â€˜â€˜With the arrest of Ravindra Sangwan, who works in a call centre in Gurgaon, we have solved a carjacking that took place in Bijwasan on Sunday.â€™â€™

The DCP said two persons had hired the car from Jaipur from a taxi stand in a hotel there. They paid an initial amount of Rs 1,000 while booking the vehicle and had to pay another Rs 3,000 after reaching Delhi.

10,Total 'bandh' on April 14,"LUCKNOW: While there would be a public holiday on April 14 on account of Dr Ambedkar birth anniversary, labour department has been given the task to ensure that all shops and commercial establishments also remain closed on the day. The cause of worry is the political affiliation of the traders, a faction of whom are loyal to Samajwadi Party.

Admitting that enforcing the government order would be a â€˜tough task,â€™ an official of the labour department said that: ""We will first request all shopkeepers to close their shops but resort to some coercive methods, if they refuse to fall in line.""

However, the government on its part is fully geared up to make the event memorable. While the massive rally being organised here on the day by CM is virtually seen as a show of strength, district magistrates have been directed to observe the day with emphasis on propagation of the Ambedkarâ€™s thoughts and preaching to the masses.

They have also been directed to hold sports events and debate competitions for school children and students on the Amebedkar ideology. For this purpose, each district has also been allocated a sum of Rs 10,000 as a special fund.

12,Dismissed minister yet to be arrested,"PATNA: While the police have promptly arrested their own men involved in the controversy regarding the â€œkidnappingâ€� and torture of Atul Prakash by the now-dismissed minister, Surendra Yadav, they are yet to lay hands on any of the three politicians, including the minister, involved in the case.

â€œWe are not reluctant. Nor are we dillydallying,â€� a senior police official said, adding, â€œwe are conducting raids but the accused politicians have gone undergroundâ€�.

Incidentally, the police were keeping a close tab on the movement of Yadav, who was seen in Patna at the residence of another MLC. But no effort was made to nab him. Police sources in Gaya, however, maintained that â€œfor tactical reasons, the police are going slowâ€�. Three police personnel â€” an SI and two constables of the Kotwali police â€”station besides Yadav, RJD MLC Azad Gandhi and Pappu Yadav, brother-in-law of CMâ€™s brother Subhash Yadav have been named as accused in the case. A Gaya court has issued warrants of arrest against the politicians.

The police initiated follow-up action after Gaya SP Raveendran Sankaran supervised the case and found it â€˜trueâ€™. The sources disclosed that action would also be initiated against Patna DSP S B Sharma for conspiring with the politicians.

14,Patna youth arrested for hoax calls,"NEW DELHI: After being made to run around by a series of hoax threat callers on bombs in some high profile targets in the capital, the Delhi Police finally managed to lay its hands on one such man who had made a false threat.

Anil Kumar Singh alias Sunny (28), hailing from Patna, was arrested by the south district police and a cellular phone used to make the alleged calls was seized from him, deputy commissioner of police (south) P Kamaraj told reporters on Thursday.

A sim card, a Maruti Esteem car and certain documents were also recovered from the accused, he said.

Anil is alleged to have made calls to police regarding planting of bombs at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), metro rail, Tihar prison, Howrah-bound Rajdhani Express and Delhi Police headquarters.

He put various demands like providing Rs five crore or releasing a particular inmate from the Tihar prison while making such calls, Kamaraj said. During interrogation, Anil admitted that he had made a hoax call in 2001 about eliminating a VVIP and blowing up the Red Fort.

The calls were allegedly made by the accused using different mobile phones purchased in fake names to make tracing difficult, Kamaraj said. The DCP was of the view that there exist lacunae in the system by which anyone can buy a cell phone without going through a thorough identification process.

Preliminary investigations revealed that Anil was allegedly involved in more than 10 cases of flesh trade, rape, kidnapping, immoral trafficking and car theft and arms act violations, he said.

15,Three separate probes into PAC violence,"LUCKNOW: As many as three inquiries are underway in Ayodhya apart from intelligence reports on the sequence of events that followed the fatal fall of a PAC jawan from the watch tower dotting RJB complex on Wednesday.

Additional director general of police (ADG) law and order Vikram Singh confirmed that to begin with is the magisterial inquiry that has been ordered by the district administration into the incidents right from the causes and fall of the PAC jawan to the violence and to events that led to bring the situation under control.

This inquiry which covers all the aspects of Wednesday is being conducted by additional district magistrate (ADM) city Narendra Patel of Ayodhya. This probe is being conducted by the ADM, on the request of the SSP Faizabad, on grounds that since the inquiry officer would probe into the conduct of the police personnel as well, it would be prudent to designate someone who can have an impartial view of the situation.

Next is the inquiry by a team of officials headed by ADG PAC Har Mol Singh. This team would look into the conduct of the PAC jawans and the district officials in tackling the issue and the aspects which made the situation more grim. The ADGâ€™s finding would throw light on the main men behind the violence and would largely deal with the lapses that deteriorated the situation to the extent to which it ended up in, Vikram Singh confirmed.

As this inquiry would table its findings on the role of the PAC jawans in the violence, the report is likely to be taken as the last word to decide on the penal action against the accused jawans.

The third leg of inquiry includes those related to the two FIRs lodged with the RJB and Kotwali police. In the case registered with the RJB police lodged by the station officer (SO) of the police station, charges have been levelled against unidentified PAC personnel for their conduct and breach of peace. Lodged by the inspector incharge of Ayodhya Kotwali, the second FIR deals with the damage to public property caused by the irate traders who gheraoed the Kotwali later in the night and ransacked the premises.

Reports said that the revenue department has been directed to conduct a comprehensive survey of all the shops damaged by the mob in Ayodhya on Wednesday events. This assessment, being done under a magistrate, would form the basis of compensation to be provided to the traders. Complaints of the traders regarding the assault and damaged caused by the PAC jawans would also be included in the assessment and subsequently transferred to the police for further investigations to decipher if the charges were true or levelled for monetary gains only.

16,'Bigamy law structure stays',"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh Women''s Commission maintained that the government had not changed the basic structure of the laws pertaining to bigamy and said that it had only amended Section 498A of Dowry Harassment Act.

The commission''s chairperson C Susheela Devi said the amendment would help couples reconcile and settle their disputes. It would not bar women from lodging another complaint if the husband or his relatives harass her again, she said.

Talking to The Times of India, the chairperson said care has been taken to protect the interests of women in the amendment. She said keeping the cases pending for three months before the court takes a decision would enable the couple to work out a compromise.

A few months back, the Commission had made a recommendation to the government to amend Section 320(2) Criminal Procedure Code including Section 498-A Indian Penal Code as compoundable offence in order to facilitate rapprochement between wife and husband avoiding prolonged legal battle.

Moreover, it had also suggested for enhancing the maintenance under Section 125 CrPC from Rs 500 to Rs 3,000 per month. The Centre has done away with the maximum limit for the maintenance allowance. When the bill was sent for obtaining the assent of the President, the Centre and the women child welfare ministry suggested that for compounding the offence under Section 498-A IPC, a period of three months should be fixed.

17,Cong corners govt in Assembly over Arjuna row,"HYDERABAD: The Congress questioned the authority of chief minister Chandrababu Naidu in staying the orders issued by IAS officer C Arjuna Rao, when he was the chief commissioner of land administration, allotting evacuee property to displaced people from Pakistan.

The party asked the government to produce documents in support of the chief ministerâ€™s action in staying the CCLAâ€™s orders.

The party also demanded that the CMâ€™s special secretary Satish Chandra, who is facing similar charges from Arjuna Rao in the case, be shifted out of the chief ministerâ€™s office to facilitate an impartial inquiry.

Congress MLAs M V Mysura Reddy, P Lakshmaiah, P Jaganmohan Rao and N Kiran Kumar Reddy, along with CPM floor leader N Narasimhaiah and BJP leader N Indrasena Reddy, examined the files pertaining to the property dispute in the speakerâ€™s chambers in the Assembly on Thursday.

The government had given an assurance in the House that all the relevant files would be placed before the speaker for the opposition partiesâ€™ perusal. Finance minister Y Ramakrishnudu, principal secretary (revenue) Priyadarshi Das, principal secretary (home) Bharat Chandra represented the government.

Mysura Reddy, who briefed the media about the developments, wanted the officials to provide the government orders which empowered the chief minister to stay Arjuna Raoâ€™s ruling. With the officials not able to satisfy the opposition members, speaker K Pratibha Bharati decided that the files may be shown again on April 21.

Mysura Reddy said Arjuna Rao passed the orders in his capacity as the deputy custodian general of evacuee properties, and that any appeal against his order should be made to the custodian general based at Mumbai.

He said that the Congress would prove, once the scrutiny of files was over, that the state government made a deliberate attempt to scuttle Arjuna Raoâ€™s hopes of becoming the chief secretary and protect Satish Chandra in the case.

The Congress leader also questioned the governmentâ€™s action in ordering an inquiry based on a complaint from the home minister, T Devender Goud. He pointed out that the Displaced Persons Act clearly states that only an aggrieved person can appeal to the higher authorities. â€œWe wanted to know how Devender Goud is figuring in the matter?,â€� Mysura remarked.

Meanwhile, finance minister Y Ramakrishnudu maintained that the government was supposed to enquire into any kind of irregularities and that opposition members deviated from the subject.

21,Stringent law on misleading ads needed,"NEW DELHI: Expressing concern on misleading advertisements relating to some ayurvedic drugs, a Parliamentary Committee has asked the Government to make the law more stringent saying otherwise the efficacy of ayurvedic medicines would be questioned.

""The Committee is of the view that the implementation of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionale Advertisement) Act, has not had the desired effect and needs to be made more stringent"", Standing Committee on Human Resource Development said in a report on the action taken by the Department of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy.

""Appearance of misleading advertisements in the print and electronic media has become a daily feature"", the committee said adding such advertisements tempt the people to buy these medicines under false pretext.

Stating that it would mean questioning the efficacy of ayurvedic drugs, the committee recommended that the Department may identify the provisions of Drugs and Magic Remedies Act which need to be made more stringent and initiate necessary action in this regard.

The Department should take up the implementation of the Act with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to tackle this problem effectively, the committee said.

The committee also criticised the slow progress of a project to set up a state-of-the-art ayurvedic hospital in Delhi saying ""...it has taken more than two years just to obtain ''expression of interest'' by the private parties.""

23,Pak continues to acquire nuke equipment: CIA,"WASHINGTON: Pakistan continued to acquire nuclear-related equipment and material from various sources, principally western Europe, and its ballistic missile programme was helped by Chinese entities, the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has said.

Pakistan''s nuclear weapons tests in late May 1998 demonstrated its well-developed nuclear weapons programme, the CIA said in a report to Congress covering the first six months of 2002.

If Pakistan chooses to develop more advanced nuclear weapons, ""seeking nuclear-related equipment and materials will remain important,"" it said.

China, said the CIA, provided ""extensive support"" in the past to Islamabad''s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, but in May 1996 it pledged not to provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities in any State, including Pakistan.

""We cannot rule out, however,"" said the CIA, ""the possibility of continued contacts between Chinese and Pakistani entities on Pakistan''s nuclear weapons development.""

Pakistan''s ballistic missile programme, said the CIA, continued to benefit from significant Chinese entity assistance during the reporting period.

26,Unchecked dogs? The law gives teeth,"NEW DELHI: Have a dog that bites? You need to be careful â€” if someone decides to take the law seriously, you could end up facing a three-year jail term.

The South-West District Police have admitted a complaint filed against against Shobha, resident of Sector 8, R K Puram, and owner of a two-feet high Bhutanese breed dog, which bit Shashi Pandey, a lawyer while she was shopping in the colony market.

Pandey, the complainant, lives in Shanker Vihar, Delhi Cantonment, and is a practising advocate at the Patiala House Courts. Shobha is a scientist with the National Informatics Centre.

According to Pande, the incident took place late last month (March 24) when she was heading home after shopping at the market in the R K Puram neighbourhood. Just then a â€˜stocky, hairyâ€™ white dog came out of a house and on to the road, and attacked her.

Police said the dog bit the lawyer on her thigh and she had to be taken to hospital and admitted there.

On March 26, she registered a complaint with the R K Puram police station.

Deputy commissioner of police (southwest), Tejinder Luthra, says the charges, if proven, could lead to a jail term of well over two years.

Pandey has alleged that the â€œfour-feet long and two-feet high white color Bhutanese dogâ€� was not chained and bit her on the road adjacent to Shobhaâ€™s flat in the middle-class government colony.

Luthra said the victim was rushed to Safdarjung Hospital and on March 26 she got the complaint registered at the R K Puram police station. In normal conditions, it could be six months-imprisonment and Rs 1,000 in fine under Section 289 IPC.

In her defence, Shobha told the police that her servant forgot to chain the dog.

Police added that Shobha had in turn lodged a complaint on April 3 saying that she had been receiving calls from the victim threatening her with a long spell in jail.

27,Failure of PDS: Vajpayee calls all-party meet,"NEW DELHI: The country''s godowns may be overflowing with foodgrains. And yet the states, including those that came pleading to the Centre seeking more grains during last year''s drought, have been extremely tardy about lifting foodgrains allocated by the Centre.

Concerned about this and other ills that plague the country''s public distribution system (PDS), Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has called an all-party meeting later this month to discuss the functioning of the PDS and how it can be improved.

The meeting comes in the wake of an assurance by Vajpayee to Parliament in the last session where he had said that such a gathering would be held to discuss the PDS after it came in for criticism in the light of reports of starvation deaths in the country following the drought.

Yet another meeting, that of chief ministers and chaired by Vajpayee is likely to be held some time later, again to discuss the PDS. This meeting has been sought by the Central food minister, Sharad Yadav.

One of the primary issues that will be discussed at the all-party meeting is what strategy can be adopted in order to increase the off-take under the PDS. For the off-take by the states, despite some increase in the Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) categories during 2002-2003, remains a matter of concern.

For as officials in the food ministry here point out, despite the increase in allocation under various categories, there hasn''t been a corresponding increase in off-take by the states.

This is particularly alarming for this poor off-take extends even to allocations made for BPL and AAY families, both schemes meant to provide grains to the country''s poor at highly subsidised rates.

Ministry officials note that even though the foodgrain allocation to BPL, AAY and APL (Above Poverty Line) categories has been increased to 35 kg per family per month which is expected to meet roughly 48 per cent of the ""normative requirements of a household"", the off-take remains far less than the allocation.

In order to increase off-take, among the issues that will come up for discussion at the all-party meeting are: ensuring that fair price shops remain open daily and that they have a regular and adequate supply foodgrains which they make available to consumers.

At present, with scarcely any checks on them by state governments, many FPS shops don''t open for days on end. And even when they do, they claim they have no stocks having diverted the grains into the open market.

The meeting will also discuss the possibility of allowing the poor to buy foodgrains from these PDS outlets in instalments for very often, they do not have the financial capability to purchase their quota in one go.

The meeting will also discuss ways and means of making PDS outlets in the country financially viable so that the temptation to divert foodgrains into the open market is reduced.

As the agenda note prepared for the meeting explains, state governments need to have a correct balance between the interests of the consumers and of the FPS owners.

One way of making FPS outlets a profitable business is by allowing the owners to offer a basket of commodities like soap, salt, and tea.

Among some of the other aspects concerning PDS which are likely to be discussed at the meeting are the excess identification of families under the BPL category by the states with the result that as against a total ceiling of 6.52 crore such families as per Planning Commission estimates of 1993-93, state governments have issued ration cards to nearly seven crore families.

This, feels the Centre, not only leads to diversion of foodgrains owing to the existence of bogus ration cards but also reduces the share of families that are actually poor.
