1,HP govt to approach SC over powers of judiciary,"SHIMLA: Chief minister Virbhadra Singh said that the Himachal government would approach the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court to raise the issue of whether the judiciary could whittle away the powers of the state as enshrined in the Constitution.

Winding up the discussion on the budget estimates for the year 2003-04 in the Himachal assembly on Friday, he said that the reason that the high court was interfering in the functioning of the legislature was because the Centre and the states had refused to exercise their powers.

He said that the judiciary, executive and legislature had their respective powers in the Constitution, but it was because of this failure of the Centre and the states to exercise their power that the judiciary had become more powerful. Even the executive had failed to exercise its powers, he added.

The chief minister said that the government had the highest respect for the judiciary and it was just not the issue of enhanced salary and other perquisites for the judicial officers. â€˜â€˜Monetary conditions can be put aside, issues like fixing of emoluments and working conditions, can the judiciary whittle away the powers of the state by a judicial orderâ€™â€™, he asked.

2,State govt staff threatens strike,"PUNE: All state government employees, including government nurses and gazetted officers, will observe a token strike on July 22 to protest against the governmentâ€™s failure to disburse the annual bonus and revised dearness allowance on grounds of paucity of funds.

Announcing this at a press conference here on Friday, Narayan Joshi, president, Poona district state government employeesâ€™ federation, threatened an indefinite strike if the employeesâ€™ demands were not met. â€œThis is the last time we will stage a token strike in this connection,â€� he said, while expressing support to the similar stir launched by Tamil Nadu government employees.

Joshi lambasted the governmentâ€™s claim that up to 70 per cent of state revenue was being spent on salaries. Citing the financial review published by the state planning board, Joshi claimed the actual amount spend on salaries was just 21.6 per cent. The interest liabilities of the state government too worked out to 21 per cent, he pointed out.

The union leader further claimed that the difference between the dearness allowance paid to central government employees and their state counterparts had increased to 10.5 per cent. Class III and IV state government employees were getting Rs 600 and Rs 400 less, respectively, every month, he said.

If paucity of funds was the real criteria, how did the government pay the revised dearness allowance and other allowances to IPS and IAS officials, he asked.

Joshi said that besides non-payment of allowances, the employees were also being harassed through arbitrary transfers. â€œWhile 25 per cent posts remain vacant, the government plans to reduce postings by 15 per cent more in view of computerisation,â€� he said. This was putting excessive workload on the existing manpower, he claimed.

3,Astrology to help pre-empt suicide bids,"KANPUR: Did you know that 15 days prior to committing suicide, a certain set of prints appear on the finger nails which indicate the person is going to end life. Or, that the shape of one''s nose gives the clue that one is contemplating suicide and by what means?

Here is a new set of theory which gives a totally different dimension to the why, when, what and where of the suicidal tendencies of a person. And to tap this source, the suicide cell at the GSVM college is going to have a unique combination of clinical analysis and astrological consultation to help people overcome suicidal tendencies.

Sushil Dimri, the astrologer who offered his services to the medical college, spoke at length about why even without a clinical assessment, by simply observing the face structure, hands and body language, the mental state of a person can be assessed. Interestingly, even the means by which a person is contemplating suicide can be guessed.

Citing examples, he said in case of people having downcast eyes, closely placed eyebrows, open earlobes or for that matter slightly flat nose, the tendency is very prominent. Hands too give the tell-tale sign. For example, if they are very soft, sensitive or have very prominent pads, the tendency is present.

For more details, a person''s horoscope can open a Pandora''s box. ""The placement of the planets in various houses, depending on the degree indicate the means by which a person is going to end life,"" he added.

For example, if the placement of Venus is not good, depending on the degree a person will commit suicide by swallowing some poison, or if the moon is badly placed and affected by other negative planets, death by hanging is most likely.
