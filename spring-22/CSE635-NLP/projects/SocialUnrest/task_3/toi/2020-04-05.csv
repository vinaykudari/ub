0,OIL adopts plan to increase crude production,"GUWAHATI: The Oil India Limited (OIL) has adopted the Corporate Strategic Plan (CSP) to increase its production from the present three million metric tonnes to around seven million metric tonnes per annum over the next ten years with a total investment of Rs. 11,000 crore. To achieve the target, OIL, as part of the CSP will make efforts to explore and produce crude oil from the existing areas of the South bank of the Brahmaputra, logistically difficult frontier areas in the North east along with other parts of the country and rest of the world.

In its final report, the IBM Global Services, a US based consultancy group submitted to the OIL top brass that the company has become stagnant with production level of 3 million metric tonne for the last several years. The report provides an insight into the companyâ€™s areas of strength and weakness to get the most, not only from their present resources but also help them take up new ventures in oil and gas fields more fruitfully.

Nripen Bharali, senior adviser (Strategic & Corporate Planning) of OIL, was here to participate in a public debate on the proposed restructuring of the company told TNN that the strategic plan for OIL as recommended by IBM Global Service envisages OIL as a global company with strong presence in the North east producing 7 metric tonne of crude oil per annum. According to him, the strategic issues faced by the OIL are declining fields and deeper reserves, cost intensive and technically extensive exploration potential, lack of crude price safety net, need to scout for equity oil overseas, underutlilisation of pipeline resources, diversification option with strategic fit and business restructuring in the changed environment.

The consultancy group has asked the OIL management to focus on exploration & production (E&P) business, outsourcing all other non-core and support activities. According to them these measures will bring greater accountability. Bharali said, implementation of business and management initiatives are being taken through seven selected modules like change in management and HR policy, performance improvement and cost reduction, information technology and corporate governance. Eminent economist and former CMD of NEDFI and chairman, Asian Development Bank, Dr Jayanta Madhab added that under the changed business environment OIL cannot afford to remain stagnant.

1,Women advocates protest CJ remark,"GUWAHATI: Women advocates, members of the Gauhati High Court Bar Association, on Saturday refused to assist in felicitating guests at the 55th anniversary celebrations of the high court here.

They were protesting against an alleged remark, made in Shillong on March 31, by Chief Justice of the high court. The remark was published in this newspaper. The report had quoted Chief Justice P P Naolekar as saying that even the highly educated, welltrained and intelligent women advocates preferred to remain in subordinate positions. The Registrar General of the high court, in a clarification on the next day, said that the report was not published in the â€œproper contextâ€�.

It stated, â€œNo reference was intended to any particular lady advocate or class of advocates and the intention was to offer encouragement to lady advocates to rise in the profession and make a name for themselves.â€� The women however refused to be appeased and vowed to carry on with their protest. â€œWe are not satisfied with the clarification. The Chief Justiceâ€™s remarks were an insult to us,â€� said Anu Baruah during a break at the foundation day function.

The women advocates registered their resentment on Friday at a meeting of the bar association and refused to take part in the felicitation of the guests and five senior advocates. The bar association had no option but to break the tradition of women handing over the traditional gamocha and flowers during the felicitation. Male members of the association did the job instead. â€œWhy should we do it (felicitation)? The men can do it too,â€� Barua said.

3,AIDS epidemic increasingly turning into gender issue,"KOLKATA: Sexual subordination of women and denial of healthcare to the fairer sex in case of an HIV infection are increasingly turning the AIDS epidemic into a burning gender issue, leading NGOs of the country dealing with women''s issues said here.

Armed with alarming UNAIDS statistics and real life stories of women afflicted with AIDS, a panel discussion on ''HIV and Women'' last evening revealed a disturbing trend -- from 41 per cent in 1997, the number of HIV infected women in 2002 out of the total AIDS affected around the globe has risen to a shocking 49.8 per cent.

""Statistics increasingly prove that both the spread and impact of HIV and AIDS is not random. It disproportionately affects women and adolescent girls who are socially, culturally, biologically and economically more vulnerable,"" says Ruchira Gupta of Mumbai-based ''Apne Aap Women Worldwide'', co-organisers of the meet ''Positive Lives'' along with Action Aid, India.

Violence against women, Gupta says, has been fuelling the spread of HIV/AIDS with rape and sexual abuse used as weapons to put millions of women at the risk of infection.

Recounting the traumatic experience of AIDS-affected women, Nisha, an HIV-positive mother, says it was an ordeal to try and access healthcare once her infection status was known.

""And not simply that, it has become a stupendous task for my family to support the treatment of our HIV positive son,"" she says.

4,India relaxes visa rules for Chinese tourists,"BEIJING: India''s strict visa rules for Chinese are being relaxed in a phased manner to woo tourists and help promote better understanding between people of the two neighbouring nations.

India would grant visa for Chinese tourist groups within 24 hours if their visa papers are in order, Indian Ambassador to China Shivshankar Menon said.

""This is a significant improvement compared to the past when Chinese tourists had to wait four days for an Indian visa,"" he said while promising to streamline the visa procedures.

The troubles for the Chinese tourists would not end here though, as an Indian visa is only valid 14 days after issuance by the Indian mission here.

At a tourism seminar organised by the Indian embassy, Chinese tour operators urged officials to take up the matter with New Delhi and further relax visa rules for Chinese tourists, who are fast emerging as big-time travellers.

Official sources said the initial relaxation of visa regime has come after the countries signed a bilateral agreement on tourism in December last year and Beijing granted Approved Destination Status (ADS) to India from April one, 2003, allowing its citizens to visit India in groups.

""With China granting ADS to India, we are ready to welcome Chinese tourists in large numbers,"" joint director-general, Department of Tourism, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, G Shanker Dhar said.

7,No Hindutva in polls: Mahajan,"JAIPUR: BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan on Sunday made it clear that his party will not use Hindutva as a plank in the forthcoming assembly elections in four states.

Mahajan, overall incharge of the election campaign in Rajasthan, Delhi, MP and Chhattisgarh, was speaking at the Press Club here.

He said economic development and the failure of the Congress governments in states to fulfil the aspirations of the people would be the main electoral issues of the party.

Asked why Hindutva would not be an issue as the BJP had used it as a plank in the Gujarat polls, Mahajan said that the electoral issues in Gujarat were completely different from the situation in the four states. He pointed out that the BJPâ€™s penetration in Nagaland in the recent assembly polls made it clear that more than Hindutva, the people were happy with the stability the BJP has provided at the Centre.

Mahajan was in Jaipur to appease dissidents in the party, particularly the senior partymen who have not been included in the executive committee set up under the new state unit president Vasundhara Raje.

Senior BJP leaders, including national treasurer Ramdas Agarwal, former deputy CM Hari Shankar Bhabhra, Ghanshyam Tiwari and former party president and MP Raghuveeveer Singh Kaushal are not happy with the appointment of Raje.

Mahajan made it clear that the party would be contesting the forthcoming polls under the leadership of Raje and the dissidents would be urged to support and cooperate with her. Mahajan also stated that Raje would be projected as the future CM.

Mahajan further pointed that BJP doesn''t propose to have any tie up with its NDA partners for the Assembly polls in the four states. He clarified that the party''s alliance with NDA members would continue in the Lok Sabha polls scheduled for 2004.

Mahajan admitted that he was aware that some of the NDA partners were coming together as a third front in these states specially Rajas than, but was confident that this would be a boon in disguise for the party as the third front would be able to break into Congress''s vote bank and shrink the Congress'' vote base.

Mahajan pointed out that the BJP which was born exactly 23 years ago on April 6th has now become the synonym for stability after completing five years in the Centre under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

He said that the party was now heading for ""Mission 2004"", but before that the party would concentrating on ""Operation 2003"" by putting all at stake for the Assembly poll in four states.

9,Pandya's father says it was a political killing,"AHMEDABAD: There were unexpected outbursts by slain BJP leader Haren Pandya''s father Vitthalbhai and also former CM Keshubhai Patel against the state leadership at a shraddhanjali (homage for Pandya) programme on Sunday.

Pandya''s father Vitthalbhai told Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, who attended the programme, clearly that Pandya''s murder was ""politically motivated"" and described the present rulers as ""Ravans"" (demons).

Keshubhai targeted the party leadership for remaining silent when injustice was meted out to Pandya, who was denied a ticket in the last assembly elections and said even after his death, he was not accorded the honour due to him.

Advani had to make a public admission that the party had done great injustice to Pandya by not giving him the ticket and said this fact was ""a burden on my conscience"".

He was almost in tears as Vitthalbhai, Pandya''s widow Jagruti, her two sons Namra and Karma took their seats in the Town Hall, next to chief minister Narendra Modi and Keshubhai. ""The party had decided to correct its mistake by inducting Haren into the central executive committee, but it was too late as he was killed before the announcement in this regard was made,"" Advani said.

He admitted that the party could not give what Pandya deserved for being one of the most dedicated and efficient leaders. ""All efforts are being made to track down culprits who had killed Pandya. Investigating agencies have made a major breakthrough and that they are about to establish a link between Pandya''s killing with the massacre of Kashmiri Pandits in Pulwama and the blasts in Mumbai,"" he said.

Keshubhai said, ""It was really unfortunate that a bold leader like Pandya was punished for no fault of him and was wrongly victimised, even the central leadership of the party turned a silent spectator to this humiliation.""

10,Concert-rally will pay tribute to Tipu,"MYSORE: On May 4, the day on which the great warrior Tipu Sultan achieved martyrdom, the sprawling lawns of Daria Daulat at Srirangapatna will reverberate with revolutionary songs which will not only highlight Tipuâ€™s life, but also spread the message of communal harmony.

What has lent credence and popularity to the event is that revolutionary balladeer Gaddar is expected to enthral the audience with his songs, which are usually a direct attack on communal forces and the imperialist regimes against which Tipu laid down his life on this day more than 200 years ago. The event, being organised by â€˜Komu Souharda Vedikeâ€™ (communal amity forum) of Mandya, is the second in a series under the banner of Karnataka Vimochana Ranga and other progressive forums. Earlier, the Ranga had mobilised more than 50,000 people for its protest rally at Chikmagalur two months ago, against the efforts of the VHP and Bajrang Dal to disturb communal harmony in the state, especially in Chikamaglur district, by raking up the Bababudangiri issue. KVR members want to make this event a success, as they feel the world is facing the danger of American hegemony.

It has formed a committee headed by freedom fighter C. Bandigowda and writer Prof H.L. Keshavamurthy to mobilise men and material for the occasion. KVR Mandya leader M.B. Nagannagowda told â€˜The Times of Indiaâ€™ that the forum is planning to mobilise more than 25,000 people from various parts of the state, particularly from Mysore and Mandya districts. â€œInstead of concentrating on the general public, we are more interested in getting writers, thinkers, student leaders and academicians to attend the function,â€� he added.

â€œWhen communal forces led by RSS, Bajrang Dal and VHP are gaining ground, we felt it necessary to organise such a function.â€� It would fit in with the spirit of Tipuâ€™s martyrdom, he felt. He said the event appears more significant with American and British forces raising their â€œcolonial headâ€�.
