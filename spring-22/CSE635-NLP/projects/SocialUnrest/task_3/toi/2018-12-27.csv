1,Karnataka health minister a quack: IMA,"bangalore: the anti-quackery cell of the indian medical association (ima) has alleged that health minister a.b. malaaka raddy is a `quack'. the association, which called for a karnataka medical bandh on december 22 and 23, had ironically asked the health minister himself to take measures against the 80,000-odd quacks in the state. raddy, a qualified allopathic doctor, while on a flight a few months ago, is supposed to have saved a co-passenger's life with homeopathy. the opinion on his timely help is divided. the cell, other than sending a notice to the minister, which till date has not been replied has also written to the karnataka homeopathic board to clarify if raddy has been registered as a homeopathic practitioner. ``he ought to be registered as as an integrated doctor based on rules of the karnataka medical council,'' says dr p janardhan rao, chairman of the cell. dr jayaprakash narayan, chairman of the national integrated medical association, differs. ``if this happened in any other country, the medical associations would have appreciated the act of the health minister for saving a life during emergency and felicitated him.'' he adds that the ima is trying to blackmail the health minister into action by sending him a notice. raddy says as of now he is not wrong, ``for there is no law against this as presently. maybe, when the law gets enacted, the judgement will be different.'' raddy says he used his knowledge of allopathy to diagnose the symptoms, ``while the suggestion i made was just a food item.'' he added ``ipractice homeopathy only on myself."" related stories

5,Water pollution sinks farmers’ future,"patancheru: villagers of kyasaram in patancheru area of medak district are careful not to cook excess rice. they would rather go hungry if it is insufficient than cook extra food. the reason: cooked rice goes bad in just six hours or so. according to sarpanch j sadanand, this is because of the heavy pollution from the industries in patancheru and pasha mailaram. what, however, is of more concern is that farmers may soon not be able to grow any crops in the entire area.the pollution, in fact, has already begun to cause damage. more than an estimated 5,215 acres of land in patancheru area is no longer under cultivation. since all the water bodies are polluted and even borewells spew polluted water, crops dry up. where farmers manage to grow paddy, the yield has come down from 40 bags per acre to 10 bags. b rehmuddin of pedda kanjarla village has three acres of land but he has not been able to grow anything on it for the last few years. i have seven children to feed but cannot grow any crop,'' he said. he spent thousands of rupees to dig a well but the water in it is polluted because of the toxic effluent from industries which have seeped into the ground. since they are unable to grow crops any longer, people have now taken up sand mining. but they are aware this cannot sustain them for long. it is frightening to think of the future,'' cenegalolo krishna of sultanpur village said. the kishtareddypeta cheruvu in the village is full, but villagers don't use the water for their crops. even animals are not allowed to drink water from it because of its high pollution level. cattle which wander off and drink water from it invariably die. an estimated 3,000 animals, including milch animals and sheep, have died in more than 20 villages in patancheru after consuming water from the polluted water bodies or the nakka vagu. in ionole village, villagers have constructed a facility for animals to drink water and do not allow them to go anywhere near the nakka vagu.

6,Chautala maintained his grip on party and state affairs,"chandigarh:it was smooth sailing for the indian national lok dal (inld) government in haryana in its second year, thanks to chief minister om prakash chautala's stranglehold on the party and its legislative wing, coupled with the failure of the congress, the main opposition party in the state, to effectively highlight the government's acts of omission and commission. on the economic front, the government did a good job in managing its finances, recording a 27 per cent increase in tax collection. the new house tax policy dominated public debate for almost the entire year, evoking widespread public resentment, forcing the government to drastically modify it. but in this case too the credit went to the chief minister who, instead of making the original policy prestige issue for his government, preferred to hold wide-ranging talks on the tax with various sections of society, including traders, chiefs of civic bodies and improvement trusts, in his bid arrive at a people-friendly tax. this succeeded in taking the wind out of the sails of the congress, which had been rearing to take on the government on this issue. the congress suffered a major setback when its call for a statewide bandh on november 2 on house tax evoked a poor response. even the other two parties, the bjp and the haryana vikas party( hvp) led by former chief minister bansi lal, remained by and large ineffective. this year too the bjp, which publicly claims to be an ally of the inld but in private spits fire at the policies and style of functioning of the chief minister, failed to snap its ties with the inld despite its repeated requests to its central leadership to allow it to do so. the party alleges that even on crucial issues like the framing of the house tax policy, the ruling party did not bother to take it into confidence, despite the fact that the policy is basically meant for the urban population, a segment of which constitutes its popular base. the central leadership of the bjp, however, has its own political compulsions that force it to overlook the interests of the state unit. it cannot afford to annoy chautala, whose party is a major constituent of the ruling national democratic alliance (nda) at the centre. the state congress unit remained a house divided, thanks to the battle for supremacy between former chief minister bhajan lal and hpcc president bhupinder singh hooda. because of this the party failed to raise issues of public interest effectively both inside and outside the state vidhan sabha. the biggest disappointment of the year for the masses has been the government's failure to sort out the satluj-yamuna link canal (syl) dispute with neighbouring punjab, despite the supreme court directive to the two states to resolve the issue through dialogue. now they are banking on the apex court, which is due to give its ruling in the case any time next year. the canal, which is projected as a 'lifeline' of the southern districts of haryana, will bring surplus ravi-beas water from punjab to these areas. the punjab government, however, has refused to construct its portion of the canal on the pretext that it has no surplus river waters to give to any state. on the power front, the state government has been able to maintain a semblance of order. the haryana power utilities recorded an increase of rs 393.87 crore in revenue assessment and rs 266.04 crore in revenue collection during the first six months of this year. an increase of 34 per cent has been recorded in the overall power supply during the current year against the year 1998-99. for the first time, peak load restrictions on industry have been withdrawn. the sixth unit of devi lal thermal power station was successfully synchronised with the grid on march 31.

8,Political parties may try to cash in on farmers’ resentment,"bathinda: the fall in cotton production, the un-remunerative price for the crop and growing resentment among the debt-ridden farmers in the district will play an important role in the forthcoming assembly elections when all major political parties in the opposition will try to capitalize on the issue and blame the sad (b)-bjp government for the pitiable condition of the cotton growers. while the state agriculture department attributed the american bollworm attack, fall in yield and low price for the cotton to nature's vagaries, the political parties are blaming the state government for the sale of spurious pesticides and unrestricted import of cotton. according to an estimate by the northern cotton corporation of india, while about 22 lakh bales of cotton were expected to be imported this year, about 16 lakh bales had already been imported. even though farmers of the area had cried themselves hoarse about the sale of spurious pesticides and substandard seeds, the state government authorities paid no heed, alleged cpi mla hardev arshi from budhladha assembly constituency of mansa district. according to him as relatives of many politicians were involved in the manufacture of spurious pesticides, the authorities concerned were hesitant to initiate action. demanding rs 15,000 per acre compensation for the cotton growers, cpi state secretary joginder dayal said the state and central governments were responsible for the distress sale of cotton by the farmers.to rope in the farmers, the cpi had organized a convention of cotton growers of punjab, haryana and rajasthan in october.

28,"Panel suggests VRS, test for govt staff","bangalore: voluntary retirement scheme (vrs) for a specific period and compulsory efficiency bar test for state government officials to make the bureaucracy pro-people and accountable are a few of the recommendations of the final report of the administrative reforms commission (arc). according to the commission's study, employees who opt for vrs are to get their pension, gratuity and other terminal benefits as they would have obtained in the course of normal retirement. the monetary benefit, however, is limited to rs 5 lakh. employees opting for vrs would be entitled to a salary for 45 days of every completed year of service and 25 days for ever years of service left before superannuation. so far only 19 employees have opted for vrs. the vrs scheme, however, should exclude employees of public sector undertakings, companies and all india service officers. accepting the report, krishna said the state government would apply its mind seriously and come out with some concrete action before the 2002-2003 budget. ``the report is revealing. it is laudable that the commission has done a job which has made other states to emulate us,'' he added. ramaswamy said the recommendations are specific in nature, practical and implementable over a period of time. ``the commission conducted functional reviews of 13 departments and has identified shortcomings both in staff deployment as well as various schemes,'' he added. the study revealed that an amount of rs 13,000 crore is being spent towards salaries, debt servicing and pension and the figure is likely to go up to rs 19,500 crore in three years. ``the figure is alarming by any standard. right sizing the otherwise unwieldy bureaucracy is imperative. we have suggestedabolition of about 27,000 existing posts which we feel are redundant and about 54,852 vacant posts,'' he added. other major recommendations are not to constitute pay commissions (pc) at frequent intervals as is being done now but once in a decade. every recommendation of the pc has costed rs 500 crore to the exchequer. the last pc was constituted in 1998. emphasising the need to infuse professionalism, discipline and work culture in the otherwise moribund bureaucracy, it has recommended suitable amendments to section 285 of the cadre and recruitment rules (compulsory retirement of officials on professional misconduct) so as to make it more meaningful. in order to simplify the day-to-day governance, the commission has suggested merging schemes which overlap thereby providing scope for misappropriation. there are totally 3,331 schemes - 2,673 state, 658 panchayatraj institutions and 235 central. ``there are hundreds of schemes which have outlived its utility and can be done away with,'' he added. on the economy measure front, the commission has suggested that except ministers, departmental secretaries, judges, heads of revenue earning and enforcement departments, other officials should use private or personal vehicles. expressing concern over the steady deterioration in moral and ethical standards in the bureaucracy as well as political establishment, the arc has called upon the political parties as well as elected representatives to evolve principles of public life and ethics code to make the system accountable, effective people-friendly. ``the government with its enormous might should take a firm stand on this vital issue,'' ramaswamy said.

29,Workers' union blasts govt for wrong policies,"pune: lamenting the inordinate delay in the development of indigenous defence equipment, v.m. bhandarkar, former chairman of the ordnance factory board, on thursday called for the integration of the defence research and development organisation (drdo), the armament manufacturing units and the quality assurance department to speed up defence-related research and development (r&d) in the country. bhandarkar said this while addressing the 12th all-india conference of defence workers'' union - the bharatiya pratiraksha mazdoor sangh (bpms), being held at khadki here. dattopant thengdi, founder member of the bharatiya mazdoor sangh, which claims to have the largest membership among labour unions in ordnance factories and defence production units, presided over the meet, while noted industrialist rahul bajaj was the chief guest. bhandarkar said it took more than 15 years for the country to develop indigenous missiles, tanks, guns and light combat vehicles, which was too long a period. he expressed regret that almost 60 per cent of defence equipment had to be imported despite india''s capability in this field. he said that in an eight-hour shift only four hours worth of production was realised thereby creating shortfall of material. employees also needed to improve their skills to ensure zero defect production and take interest in research and development, which would tremendously enhance production. ""this would strengthen our defences,"" he added. in his presidential address, dattopant thengdi came down heavily on the union government for following wrong economic policies and adopting a partisan attitude. describing the world trade organisation''s (wto) policies as ''economic terrorism'', he said, developing countries should unite and demand treatment on par with the developed countries when it came to decision making. ""if this does not happen, we should quit wto,"" he stated. thengdi remarked that protecting the sovereignty and independence of our country was the primary duty of the union government. however, as the government was adopting wrong economic policies industrialists like rahul bajaj should use their moral right to bring pressure on the government to make them follow correct policies. in his speech, industrialist rahul bajaj said that wrong tendencies like neglecting merit, trying to gain something without doing hard work and demanding rights without fulfilling duties went against national interests. he criticised the lack of planned development in the city, which had caused its haphazard growth, chaotic traffic and increasing pollution. he also felt that there was a feeling of mutual suspicion between management and workers, which needed to be removed if the country was to attain a position among the top three countries of the world. he remarked that the government was ignoring people''s aspiration while giving unnecessarily importance to institutions like the world bank, wto and imf. the three-day convention concludes on saturday.

30,Up close and personal with law-keepers,"pune: the ordinary person with no 'clout' or 'pull' thinks twice before setting foot in a police station. so, what were literally thousands of citizens doing flocking voluntarily to the 19 police stations in the city on thursday? they were getting better acquainted with the guardians of the law who were holding an 'open-house' as part of the crime prevention week which extends from december 24-30. the visitors mostly consisted of enthusiastic students and youngsters. most of them made a beeline for the fire-arms on display, taking the opportunity to touch, feel and ask questions about the notorious ak-47, hitherto seen only in newspapers and bollywood potboilers. even regulation stuff like 9 mm carbines, tear-gas guns and the timeless 0.303 police rifle drew avid enquiries. the faraskhana police had displayed explosive materials, including the deadly rdx much beloved by terrorists and plastic explosives, and various types of detonators. for many, the highlight of the visit was lucy, the police's ace sniffer dog who demonstrating her tracking and chasing skills much to the delight of her audience. the police wireless equipment was also curiously examined and the more adventurous checked out the lock-ups and asked the police questions about their inmates. some took the opportunity to gain a little expert knowledge: ""what is the difference between police custody and magisterial custody?"" someone asked. station major (assistant sub-inspector) v.g. varpe of the deccan police station had to patiently explain to one enquirer what happens after a complaint is lodged. someone else asked how articles and weapons acquired from scenes of crime are collected and preserved. deputy commissioner of police (dcp) vinod lokhande personally took visitors around on a conducted tour of the faraskhana police station and provided information on some of the lethal weapons on display. the usually formidable-looking constables were on their best behaviour, answering all questions politely and even volunteering information! so, what did umesh divane of the marathwada mitra mandal's college of commerce, think of this close encounter with the law enforcers? he said he was thrilled to see and handle weapons. ""i had never thought of joining the police force, but after this visit, it's an option i might consider,"" he said. and garware college student prachi ambekar said she shed several misconceptions about the police: ""they should organise more such events."" there were the usual cribbers, of course. one said sarcastically that instead of conducting such public relations exercises, the time should be spent on cracking down on the nexus between criminals and politicians. more considerate critics said the time should have been used for giving the overworked constabulary a much-needed rest. criticism nothwithstanding, police officials estimate that more than 20,000 people visited the city's police stations on the day.

31,'FB's demand for deputy chief minister absurd',"midnapore, west bengal: a prominent cpi leader thursday said that there is no need for a deputy chief minister in west bengal as voiced by the forward block, describing the demand as 'absurd'. prabodh pande, the cpi mp, said that during joti basu's chief ministership there was a genuine need for a deputy chief minister since basu was not in the pink of health and therefore had not had a firm grip on the administration. the present chief minister, buddhadev bhattacharya, is taking decisions on all vital administrative matters ''in consultation with other left front partners'' and as such there is no scope for creating a deputy chief minister's post, pande said. the mp made the significant remarks before reporters after the end of three-day annual general meeting of the cpi here.

""if the charges made by me are proved to be false, i will commit self-immolation at bhawati chowk here"", she said. bharti said the projects which were being delayed included those relating to construction of a railway overbridge, sports complex and bringing water from narmada. she said if the government was serious, at least the first phase for bringing water from narmada would have been completed by now, adding, it would be advisable to get a loan for bringing the water from the narmada river to the city. she said there was no point in taking a loan from the asian development bank since it charges one per cent more interest as compared to hudco. describing chief minister digvijay singh as a joker, bharti said that she was saying this because he was in the habit of dismissing lightly even the most serious issues.
