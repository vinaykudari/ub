0,"Exim policy well devised, say businessmen","surat: the new exim policy announced by the ministry of commerce, aiming to record exports of $80-billion by the year 2007 and proposing setting up of special economic zones has been billed as a well-devised initiative for overall economic development by the industrialists here. southern gujarat chamber of commerce and industry president praful shah said that the entry of the foreign banks would help guaranteed and fast transactions of finances in a highly ambitious export thrust of the government. the special package for the handicrafts, handlooms and cottage industry would also encourage composite trade development and was likely to encourage big export houses to take interest in the trade thereby providing better services which in turn would benefit the artisans, shah added. he also felt that the policy had come almost immediately after the approval of an apparel park in surat and with the liberal announcement made in it, the export of apparels would provide an excellent business opportunity to the trade and industry of this region. while the southern gujarat region had been the green bowl of the state with its wide-ranging agriculture products, it would greatly benefit if a special export zone for agricultural products was developed at surat, he elaborated. the inclusion of floriculture will open new avenues for the development of farming of different flowers for export. it may be mentioned that the consul general of israel had shown interest during his recent visit to sgcci, sources informed. shah added that the setting up of such a zone would also increase investment in food processing industries which would ultimately result in value added exports and finally increase the general turnover for the export potential of the country as well as the region. the inclusion of rough diamonds in the incentive package - with the removal of custom duty - will greatly help the industries engaged in the business here. shah highlighted the fact that the textile policy at state and central level, the exim policy and the commitment of the trade and industry to meet the new challenges of globalisation will together provide good opportunity for the overall development of trade and industry in the south gujarat region. the increase of time limit for completing export procedures from 180 to 360 days would be another far reaching benefit for the units to complete their export commitments, he said.

1,No rules bent to admit CM's son: VC,"mumbai: mumbai university has refuted the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishadâ€™s (abvp) allegations that rules had been bent to give admissions to the sons of chief minister vilasrao deshmukh and opposition leader narayan rane in the commerce department. not many faculty members are taken in by the varsityâ€™s explanations though. the abvp alleged on sunday that dhiraj vilasrao deshmukh and nilesh narayan rane had been admitted to the m.com part i course despite scoring less marks than several other applicants. while vice-chancellor b.l. mungekar called the accusationsâ€™ â€œbaselessâ€™â€™, faculty members alleged that the entire admission procedure had been â€œimproperâ€™â€™. the dean of the varsityâ€™s commerce faculty, m.g. shirahatti, in fact said he had not been consulted about the admissions. according to mr mungekar, the cmâ€™s son had been declared eligible for admission on september 8 last year. the cutoff percentage was 50.43 and he had scored 61.86 per cent, mr mungekar said. on the basis of his marks, dhiraj was ranked 48th among the 62 students then admitted to the department, he added. nilesh rane was admitted due to his qualifications as a sportsman, mr mungekar said. mr rane was the only candidate to apply under the sports quota and he had certificates from his college authorities and other associations about his sports activities, he added. many faculty members, however, are not too convinced. for one, â€œthe admission process last year was improperâ€™â€™, alleged a faculty member. in fact, a committee had been set up purely to monitor the admission process, mainly because there were complaints of irregularities, a faculty member said. â€œthe strange thing was that the committee was not given a chance to monitor the admissions and it could not meet even once,â€™â€™ a committee member said. mr shirahatti said the varsity announced the committeeâ€™s institution but did not issue letters to any of the members. â€œwhen we checked, we were told that the admissions were over,â€™â€™ he told this newspaper. moreover, the varsity later increased the number of seats in the m.com course from 60 to 80. but even then,â€œwe were not asked to monitor admissions, everyone was kept in the darkâ€™â€™, mr shirahatti said. when such allegations were made, an inquiry should be conducted, he added. secondly, questions are being raised about the way the varsity increased the number of m.com seats. abvp representatives alleged that the increase in seats was carried out without following the rules. â€œthe university is supposed to get the permission of the board of university teaching and research before increasing seats, but the board was not consulted on the issue,â€™â€™ an abvp member said. the seats were increased mainly to accommodate both the students, he added. mr mungekar said the boardâ€™s sanction was not needed to increase seats, as the varsityâ€™s academic council had ratified the decision. also, the two would have been admitted even if there had been no increase in seats, he added. the third contentious point is the fact that nilesh was admitted under the sports category. according to mr mungekar, the varsityâ€™s sports committee recommended last april that two seats should be reserved for people who had excelled in sports. the varsityâ€™s management council ratified the recommendation in june last year, the vicechancellor said. when asked in which areas nilesh had excelled, the vicechancellor said, â€œhe had certificates from his college authorities and sports associations, showing he had taken part in district- and state-level sports activities.â€™â€™ when asked if nilesh had won any prize, the vice-chancellor said,â€œthe certificates only say he took part in the activities.â€™â€™ mr rane also produced certificates to prove he had participated in sports events conducted by the thane marathon trust and thane district amateur athletic association, among others.

2,Non-existing principals vacancies advertised,"allahabad: confusion seems to have gripped secondary schools in 10 zones under the purview of up madhyamik shiksha chayan ayog, allegedly due to the negligence on the part of district inspector of schools (dios) here. on march 3, the ayog advertised some 900 vacancies for the principalâ€™s post in secondary schools, when only half that number were actually available. departmental sources seem to put the onus on the ayog for not scrutinising existing vacancies before releasing the ad. on the other hand, ayog chairman bb srivastava told the tnn that the dios should bear the responsibility for the major discrepancy. the dios office had wrongly informed the ayog about vacancies, when procedures required it to keep the ayog informed about such vacancies. since those pending had to be cleared, an ad was released. many principals are unable to fathom how their posts have been declared vacant. some even approached the ayog to clarify the situation. reportedly the dios offices did not deem it fit to inform the ayog about principals being embroiled in litigation regarding seniority, retirement and new ph.d criteria, in the prescribed format. deeming the posts to be vacant, the ayog had issued the advertisement. dr srivastava said that norms for selection of principals have been relaxed. even those involved in litigation can apply and and after being selected, they can withdraw the cases. dios naval kishore was not available for comments.

3,‘Biotechnology can help agricultural growth’,"lucknow: can biotechnology provide an answer to a farmerâ€™s prayer? while the detractors may react, from mild unease to strong opposition, about recombinant dna technology and transgenic crop, cs prakash, professor plant molecular genetic college of agriculture, tuskegee university, usa, hails them as ultimate man-made miracle. at a seminar on â€˜relevance of biotechnology to agriculture in indiaâ€™, hosted by the cii on tuesday, prakash pleaded the cause for the need to develop innovative value-added agricultural products to enhance the revenue base of farming.â€� a revitalised â€œindian agriculture can be the engine of growth for the 21st century,â€� he said and added that â€œbiotechnology can provide the needed fuel.â€� prakash said: â€œmost experts believe that the greatest promise of biotechnology is in its application in developing countries like india and china because of their high reliance on agriculture, large farming areas, low-yield crop and the urgency for food increase and economic revitalisation. countries like mexico, argentina, china and chile,â€� he pointed out â€œhave already made considerable economic advances by integrating biotechnology into their agricultural programmes while many others are following close behind. india can, therefore, ignore biotechnology only at its own peril.â€� recounting its positive aspects, the scientist said that it could minimise crop damage through disease and pest-resistant varieties while reducing the use of chemicals. â€œeven the problems indian conventional farming faces, like blast in rice, rust in wheat, leaf rust in coffee, viruses in tomatoes and chilies and leaf spot in groundnut can be significantly minimised in an ecologically-friendly manner with the development of genetically- reprogrammed seeds designed to resist these disease attacks. â€œmoreover, hazardous substances like neurotoxins in kesar dal, cynide in tapioca, afltoxins in ground nuts and antimetabolites in chickpeas, horsegram and sweet potatoes can be silenced effectively with the help of biotechnology,â€� he claimed. later, addressing the gathering, p pushpangdan from the nbri, sps khanuja from the cimap, hn shahi from the indian institute of sugarcane research and bs shrivastava from the cdri apprised the participants of their contribution in the field. cii director sunil mishra said that lucknow with its multi-disciplinary blend of excellent facilities and expertise in the area could be developed as a biotechnology city in times to come.

6,Ex-ministers’ phones disconnected,"lucknow: for the beleaguered bjp leaders and its allies their is no dearth of bad news. after the humiliation at the hustings, they now face disconnection of their telephone lines.in fact the phones of 33 ministers,including that of ex-chief minister rajnath singh,have already gone â€˜deadâ€™. this follows a written submission by an osd of sachivalaya prashasan to the bharatiya sanchar nigam limited (bsnl) literally disowning the former bosses and calling for immediate disconnection and withdrawal of telephone facilities at their residences. in a letter the state government has attached a list of 63 ministers whose phone connections are to be cut. following state govt letter , the finance and commercial wings of bsnl have issued a terse missive on tuesday to all sdos in various exchanges covering vvip colonies to snap phone connections within 48-hours of all the 63 ministers including that of former chief minister rajnath singh installed at his official 5, kalidas marg residence. according to sources the process of cutting phones was already underway by tuesday evening and phones lines of as many as 33 ministers had already gone dead. and feeling the pangs of being out of power is rajnath singh (23005-06) himself alongwith the then finance minister harish chandra srivastava (216014), urban development minister lalji tandon (238811), pwd minister om prakash singh (236116) and more than two dozen cabinet ministers. talking to the times news network on conditions of anonymity a senior bsnl official conceded that while they had ordered a complete cutting of all connections of former ministers, many were spared â€œowing to their cloutâ€�. â€œthere are problem areas but we would sort them out within a day or twoâ€� said the official. and so while many exchanges have complied with the orders some like the gomtinagar exchange have not done so till now. while most bsnl officials are taking umbrage to the letter from secretariat administration to withdraw telephone connections , reliable sources pointed out that alacrity shown in compliance of this request owed its genesis to the staggering telephone bills due on the ministers. the bills running into several lakhs are yet to be paid by the government for the month of february-march. â€œfaced with the spectre of even more hefty bills after being voted out of power, the government is also trying to do away with its responsibilityâ€�, said an official. the â€˜roll callâ€™ includes raghuraj pratap singh, ranganath mishra, suresh khanna, baleshwar tyagi, mahendra nath pandey, ram lakhan pasi, dhanraj yadav, mangal singh saini, rajdhari singh, phagu chauhan, ram prasad â€” all ministers with bills clocking anywhere between rs 17, 000 to 1.34 lakh. telephone connections of all legislators of the 13th vidhan sabha except for the speaker vidhan sabha have since been disconnected, officials said.

7,'Laloo fought '95 polls with donation',"patna: the cbi special court on tuesday examined two defence witnesses in connection with the disproportionate asset case against cm rabri devi and rjd supremo laloo prasad yadav. special judge for fodder scam cases s k mishra heard the examination and cross-examination of raj kishore yadav and maya shankar singh of raghopur assembly constituency from where laloo had contested the 1995 assembly election. the thrust of the examination was whether laloo fought the election by means of donation or personal money. the cbi has prosecuted laloo and rabri for allegedly having assets disproportionate to their income. the cbi considers the money spent on the election as lalooâ€™s expense and adds it to his income. lalooâ€™s lawyers are contending that the election was fought on the basis of donation and that the expense cannot be clubbed with his income. the case is an offshoot of the multi-billion fodder scam case in which laloo is one of the key accused. the trial is far from complete with only 22 of the 117 defence witnesses examined so far. defence lawyer p p singh started his examination in chief to show he (laloo) had raised the money as a prelude to establish that his client had fought the assembly election on donation. singh asked raj kishore how he had contributed to the election. raj kishore said laloo intended to fight the 1995 assembly election from danapur. he further said that he (raj kishore) and maya shankar singh had persuaded laloo to contest the election from raghopur and promised to fund it by raising donation. approximately rs 44,000 was spent, he said and added that he had raised rs 2,000 by the way of donation before laloo filed his nomination and rs 4,000 later in which he had personally contributed rs 200 and deposited the money with former minister bhola rai alias uday narain rai of raghopur. at that time, rai was lalooâ€™s election agent. however, when cbi counsel l r ansari asked him if he had given any receipt of the donation money, raj kishore replied in the negative. when ansari asked him if he had taken receipt of the money from bhola rai, he again replied in the negative. ansari again quizzed him if bhola rai noted the contribution to the election fund in any notebook, his reply was again negative. raj kishore had again no answers when asked if he saw bhola rai spending any money on fuel, loudspeaker and boat. raj kishore was then asked how many banners were put up. he was asked if he saw laloo taking or spending money. he was also asked how many meetings laloo had with bhola rai. but raj kishore had no answers. defence lawyer p p singh also examined the next witness maya shankar singh. maya deposed that he had raised rs 5,000 after lalooâ€™s nomination and handed over the money to bhola rai. ansari asked maya the same set of questions in the cross-examination which was posed to raj kishore. maya, too, replied mostly in the negative.

8,Illegal occupants of govt houses to be vacated,"patna: building construction minister md taslimuddin on tuesday announced in the legislative council that all government quarters under illegal possession of senior officials would be vacated within a month. the minister said this while replying to a starred question of nand kishore ram (rjd) who sought information whether 95 per cent of the government quarters allotted to officials from the central pool were under possession of criminals and was that causing a loss to the exchequer. the members, cutting across the party lines, were on their feet when the minister said the quarters under the central pool are sanctioned by a house allotment committee and that the allotment is done only after procuring a list from the concerned executive engineer of the department. he said not a single quarter is under occupation of unauthorised persons. in his supplementary question, nand kishore ram said that many officials, who have been transferred to other districts, were still occupying the government quarters in the state capital and yet some others dared to let them out to others at the cost of the governmentâ€™s revenue. the minister said that he would get the matter examined by the district magistrate. mangani lal mandal (samata) said that the government was trying to dilly-dally the serious issue and added that it had no information as to how many quarters are vacant and how many are under illegal possession. ram kripal yadav, bhola prasad singh (both rjd), and mahachandra singh (congress) demanded that the matter be referred to the call attention committee. the minister then assured the house that all such quarters under the illegal possessions would be vacated within a month. through a calling attention motion, mahachandra raised the issue of provision of tax exemption to tractor-trailer so that small and marginal farmers do not suffer. he said if farmers are subjected to tax on tractor-trailer, how will they carry their agricultural produce to the market. besides, defaulting farmers are also subjected to 200 per cent penalty for not paying taxes. sheonandan prasad singh said it was a draconian provision. purve said that farmers using tractors for agricultural use would not be subjected to tax. however, once the vehicle is used for commercial purposes the farmers would be liable for one-time tax payment at the concessional rate of rs 3,000 for 15 years, he added. at this, both mahachandra and sheonandan trooped to the well of the house saying that the governmentâ€™s reply is confusing. meanwhile, the council passed the bihar self-supporting cooperative committee (amendment) bill, bihar cooperative society (amendment) bill, and bihar panchayat raj (amendment) bill, 2002, without making any amendments. these bills were earlier passed by the assembly.

9,Workers protest retrenchment move,"pathankot: workers of the punjab state electricity board have started protest action against the state governmentâ€™s proposal to retrench 14,000 employees and hike power tariff. the workersâ€™ unions have formed a joint action committee for the purpose.the workers are agitated over the hike in power rates which they feel are being imposed on consumers to make up for the losses suffered by the board due to its its faulty policies, power theft and rampant corruption. â€˜â€˜if the pseb management checks power thefts, it would be able to repay its rs 12,588 crore loans. but, since politicians, senior government officials and board officials themselves are involved in a majority of such cases, corrective steps lead nowhere,â€™â€™ pseb workersâ€™ union leader rattan lal said, on tuesday. charging the government with not protecting the workersâ€™ interests, he said that while the amarinder government dare not revert the previous akali decision to provide farmers with free power for fear of losing a large vote bank, workers were being rendered jobless though there were a large number of vacancies that should have been filled to revamp the board services.

13,Cong MP lashes out at Kerala liquor policy,"thiruvananthapuram: congress leader v.m. sudheeran, mp, on wednesday lashed out at the new liquor policy of the antony government, alleging that it would trigger free flow of illicit liquor and spirit and help the excise lobby. ""the sum total of the new policy is that it greatly helps liquor lobby to reap huge profit by exploiting the common man,"" sudheeran said in a letter to chief minister a.k. antony. while expressing his `protest and sadness'', he said personally he was pained to note that such a policy had evolved when the state was ruled by antony. ""never before has the state been witness to free flow of illicit liquor and spirit... though the government has not been able to do much to solve the problems of people it could prove that it is ready to go any extent to please the liquor lobby,"" he said. illicit liquor and `seconds'' are available in plenty in bars in the state. this was happening at a time when the state''s funds crunch and need to boost revenue were being discussed, he said. the decision to issue individual licences to run toddy shops and lifting of curbs on inter-district movement would promote ""benami"" business and help liquor barons to reap profit by exploiting the common man, the congress leader said. while there were no indications in the policy of closing down unlawfully functioning bars, it had offered bar licences to all hotels having ""three star"" status and above, sudheeran added.

14,Police violated law: Experts,"new delhi: legal experts say police officials who did not verify the age of the three boys picked up from lodhi gardens on march 10 and charged them with robbery, contravened provisions of the juvenile justice act. the act states that a juvenile cannot be sent to jail while his/her age and antecedents are being verified on court orders. such an offender must be released on bail. a juvenile can be sent to an observation home if the magistrate or police have reasonable grounds to believe that the release is likely to bring him or her into association with criminals. former additional solicitor-general k t s tulsi said severe action should be initiated against the police official who fails to lend an ear to a juvenileâ€™s claim. â€˜â€˜if someone claims he or she is a juvenile, the police have to verify. until the verification process is over, the police have to release the juvenile on bail, irrespective of the severity of the offence.â€™â€™ the act also provides an opportunity to the family of juveniles to file a complaint before the government against the erring official. tulsi said it was unfortunate that even though the boys had claimed they were juveniles at the time of arrest, the police had failed to verify their age. â€˜â€˜on wednesday they admitted before the court that one of the boys is a juvenile. but the damage is done. the police have already exposed this boy to mental and physical suffering,â€™â€™ tulsi said. senior criminal lawyer r k anand also voiced a similar concern. anand said a juvenile is entitled to bail, with or without surety, irrespective of anything contained in the criminal procedure code. â€˜â€˜the fact that the boys were going to take the board examination shows that they were juveniles,â€™â€™ he said.
