0,Stricter laws soon against 'gutkha' use,"PUNE: Consuming gutkha and paan masala will not invite legal action, at least for now, state excise and food and drugs minister Anil Deshmukh said on Tuesday.

He was divulging plans for strict enforcement of the ban on manufacturing, storing and selling of the addictive products.

â€œPresently there is no provision in the law to book those chewing gutkha or paan masala. However, we are trying to amend the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, to include a proviso to penalise even those who are found chewing these two products,â€™â€™ Deshmukh said at a press conference held at Mantralaya.

The minister said the state government had repeatedly urged the Centre to impose a nation-wide ban on these two addictive products, considering the harmful impact it has on the younger generation.

â€œHowever, the Centre did not react favourably to our letters and instead advised us to initiate an awareness campaign in the state to inform the people about the ill-effects of chewing gutkha and paan masala,â€™â€™ he said.

Deshmukh said the notification banning the two products was issued on Tuesday and that it would come into effect from August 1.

â€œBy the stipulated deadline the manufacturers will have to stop production and those storing and selling gutkha will have to destroy their stock,â€™â€™ he informed.

Any person flouting the ban will be liable for prosecution and face imprisonment of up to three years and a minimum fine of Rs 1,000, Deshmukh said.

To enforce the ban, all districts in the state would create special task forces comprising officials from the food and drugs administration and the police.

1,City cable operators defy bandh call,"PUNE: Although cable operators in Mumbai and Delhi began a dayâ€™s blackout of all channels from 9 pm on Tuesday, their counterparts in the city did not follow suit.

The call for the blackout was given in protest against the delay in tabling an amendment to the Cable TV Act which will pave way for conditional access system (CAS).

There has been a delay in tabling the Bill in the Rajya Sabha, which will enable subscribers to choose the channels they want to see.

Leading multi-system operators in Mumbai including INCablenet, WinCable and Siti Cable of the Zee group, met on Monday to deliberate the issue. Cable operators in New Delhi have already started blacking out channels for an hour everyday to highlight the delay in allowing CAS, which, they said, was in the interest of the subscribers.

However, the two major cable networks in the city - the Pune Associated Cable (PAC) and ICC for U - told TNN that they would not participate in the one-day blackout.

2,Violence mars Jharkhand bandh; 5 die,"RANCHI: Five persons, including four tribals, were killed and at least 25 injured, 11 of them seriously, as the Jharkhand bandh on Wednesday took a violent turn. The bandh was sponsored by the lobby supporting the state governmentâ€™s domicile policy.The bandh protagonists clashed with groups opposing the policy at various places in and around Ranchi resulting in gunfight. The rest of the state, including Jamshedpur, Dhanbad and Bokaro, was reported to be largely peaceful though the bandh at these places was total.According to official information, the deaths did not take place due to any police action but three tribal youths were killed when private security guards at the Mecon Colony fired at them in defence. The other two died during an exchange of fire between tribal and non-tribal groups at Tiril and Adarsh Nagar villages on the outskirts of Ranchi. Significantly, the Babulal Marandi government, despite facing two more violent bandhs in the last one week, chose not to take the Wednesday call seriously, and armed bandh supporters thronged the streets of Ranchi and its outskirts freely, even as the police and paramilitary forces were conspicuous by their absence or chose to remain mute spectators to the clashes.As Marandi was camping in New Delhi, chief secretary V S Dubey, while admitting the lack of sufficient preparation by the government, asserted that it has taken note of the protest but would not tolerate further violence.Dubey said the government is keeping constant vigil on the situation and would take stringent measures, including clamping of curfew, if the situation so demanded. Groups supporting the domicile policy practically laid siege to Ranchi, causing a complete disruption in the railway, air and road services while the city, including its essential services like electricity and water, remained paralysed.At least 58 organisations supported by political parties, including the AJSU and Jharkhand Peopleâ€™s Party, had called for the bandh on Wednesday in support of the governmentâ€™s domicile policy.Bandh supporters targeted public sector undertaking offices and colonies, government offices, media houses and mediapersons.While the glass panes of The Times of India office at the Srilok complex here were pelted with stones, the two-wheelers of the lensmen of two dailies were burnt by the mobs. Bandh supporters entered the Adarsh Nagar area in Dhurwa of HEC township and ransacked houses. Later, the womenfolk of Adarsh Nagar burnt down the Hatia police station. Water resources minister R Kesriâ€™s bodyguards fired several rounds in the air to disperse a crowd trying to enter the ministerâ€™s residence.Related stories:",RANCHI
3,Lenders bank on new law to trim NPAs,"MUMBAI: Itâ€™s an ordinance that will have a huge impact on bank funding for businesses. The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Ordinance, 2002, now introduced in Parliament as a bill, effectively puts banks in the driving seat when it comes to recovering money from defaulting companies.

The ordinance takes the judicial system out of the loan recovery process for banks. If a corporate borrower has defaulted on its loans for six months, banks can call for their money, to be repaid within 60 days.

After this, the creditors can take control of the debtorâ€™s assets, replace the companyâ€™s entire management and even sell the assets. Moreover, if the promoters have given personal guarantees for the loans, their assets can also be attached and sold.

It isnâ€™t easy for the defaulting debtor to appeal the decision either. To get a hearing, the company has to deposit 75 per cent of the money owed with a Debt Recovery Tribunal.

This has led business circles to describe the ordinance, rather unfairly, as the â€˜financial Potaâ€™.

â€˜â€˜The ordinance empowers creditors outside the court process as the current laws and the slow judicial process is friendly to debtors,â€™â€™ said Soma Singh, a corporate lawyer in the Mumbai High Court.

Industry bodies have been quick to criticise the new foreclosure ordinance, describing it as draconian.

They have been lobbying for changes while the bill passes through Parliament. But banks and financial institutions have been quick to seize the opportunity to recover some of their dues.

4,Samata seeks Centre's help on domicile policy,"RANCHI: The Samata Party a coalition partner in the Babulal Marandi government on Thursday sought Centre''s intervention to end ongoing agitations in Jharkhand over the controversial domicile policy which has been plaguing the state for quite some time.

""Centre should seriously think to intervene following the present violent incidents in Jharkhand over the domicile issue and stop them,"" said Samata Party Spokesman Promod Mishra.

He alleged that some ministers were voicing different statements over the policy ""creating more confusion among the masses"" and appealed to the intellectuals to come forward and save the state from this orgy.

However, the Congress and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha blamed the state administration for Wednesday''s large scale violence which had left five persons killed and 25 others injured.

""The state government knew that such thing would happen particularly after the Jamshedpur incidents on July 20. But it failed to control law and order during yesterday''s bandh,"" said Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee President Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu.

He demanded compensation to the kin of those killed in the violence.

The JMM supremo, Sibu Soren, said the chief minister should own responsibility for the violence and quit and ""seek fresh mandate"".

The CPI-ML leader Manoj Bakht also blamed the government for the present crisis.

6,Fund to help farmers in Kerala,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala government in conjunction with the nationalised and cooperative banks is considering setting up a corpus fund to help the farmers suffering due to fall in prices of agricultural products, State Agriculture and Coir Minister K R Gouri told the Assembly on Thursday.

Change in the export-import policy of the centre following liberalisation is one of the main reasons for fall in prices of cash and agriculture products in the state, the minister said during the Question Hour.

Prices of pepper, coffee and cardamom had come down in the last one year, whereas prices of some other products like rubber, copra and corriander had increased, she said.

The state governent has asked the centre to make certain modifications in the present import policy, she said.

High cost of production and less productivity in the state was also largely responsible for the present situation faced by the farmers, she said.

It had become very difficult for products from the state to compete in the international market, she said, adding, change in the import policy of the centre was not the whole cause of the crisis in the agriculture sector.

For improving the productivity, a committee comprising experts from the Agriculture Univerity has been formed, she said.

The proposal to exempt agricultural products that faced price fall from the purview of agriculture income tax could be considered, she said.

""I read in newspapers today that the anti-domicile groups have once again called a bandh tomorrow in protest against yesterday''s violent incidents. If it is true I appeal to them to cancel it,"" Kesari said.

""I will talk to Chief Minister Babulal Marandi to bar bandhs for at least one year in the state as it is hampering the progress of the state,"" he said.

Kesari also expressed surprise over pro-domicile groups calling bandhs saying, ""the domicile policy is meant for them"".

Anti-domicile groups -- Jharkhand Upekshit Manch and Jharkhand Chatra Yuva Sangharsh Manch -- had earlier threatened to call another bandh if the pro-domicile groups resorted to violence during the July 24 bandh. The groups had already observed a bandh on July 18.

10,Opposition raps govt on drought situation,"NEW DELHI: Opposition members in the Lok Sabha on Thursday attacked the government for its failure in tackling the drought situation in the country.

They asked the government to list out measures adopted so far to provide additional food grains, fodder and essential commodities to the states to tide over the crisis.

Initiating a special discussion on flood and drought in various parts of the country under Rule 193 which does not entail voting, Ajay Singh Chautala (INLD) regretted the failure of successive governments in formulating a sound water management policy. He said that certain irrigation projects envisaged in the First Five Year Plan were being included in the Tenth Five Year Plan now.

""The water management problem in the country which leads to floods and drought is man-made as it has never been properly looked into,"" he added, observing the current drought situation was leading to migration from affected regions.

Chautala demanded immediate action by the Government saying delayed measures would lead to worsening of the situation and add to woes of the farmers whose crops have dried up. He also pleaded for steps to provide drinking water.

Congress member Mani Shankar Aiyer recalled the arrangements made by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi after monsoons had failed in 1987 and said he toured the drought-affected areas to redress people''s grievances.

11,Jharkhand bracing for another bandh tomorrow,"RANCHI: Jharkhand braced for yet another state-wide bandh on Friday, the fourth in eight days, called by an anti-domicile group in protest against violence during the pro-domicile shutdown on Wednesday as the police clamped curfew in three police station areas in the capital city.

Anti-domicile Jharkhand Yuva Chatra Sangharsh Samitee leader Uday Shanker Ojha, announcing the bandh here on Thursday, said ""after 24 hours we will decide whether to increase the duration.""

Jharkhand Ukpekshit Manch, Jharkhand Sangarsh Manch and 38 other anti-domicile groups had extended support to the bandh, he claimed.

Meanwhile, an uneasy calm prevailed in Ranchi, the epicentre of Wednesday''s violence which left five dead, with many shops keeping their shutters down.

IG (operation) R C Kaithal said that curfew was clamped in Doranda, Hatia and Jagannathpur at 5:00 am on Thursday morning and would remain in force for 24 hours.

He, however, described the situation in the state capital as ""perfectly all right"".

Parliamentary Affairs Minister and Samata Party legislature party leader Ram Chandra Kesari appealed to the anti-domicile groups not to go ahead with Friday''s bandh.

Kesri said that he would speak to Chief Minister Babulal Marandi to ban bandhs for at least a year in the state as it was hampering progress.

In Jamshedpur, general secretary of All-Jharkhand Students Union (Besra), Surya Singh Besra, also disapproved frequent bandhs, saying Friday''s bandh was unjustified.

14,Rabri’s 5-yr rule fails to impress Oppn,"PATNA: On Thursday, Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi completed five years in her office. On the day, she inaugurated a cleanliness drive launched by RJD workers in the wake of the Patna Municipal Corporation strike, but it was a tamed affair.

Ironically, the entire city is stinking with heaps of garbage as Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) employees have gone on an indefinite strike demanding revised pay scales, and the threat of strict action has not worked. Asked by mediapersons to give her remark, Rabri, searching for words, said, Hum kya bolen (What can I say). However, she went to predict that she would remain in power for 25 years more. â€œI have won the peopleâ€™s mandate second time,â€� she recalled, and hoped that the state would make progress.

She blamed the BJP-led government at the Centre for allegedly withholding funds because the RJD was their political opponent.

Referring to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Janata Dal(U) MLAs deserting their parties to join her, she said that her party had achieved a majority in the House on its own. She did not have kind words for Mayawati.

The state public relations department (PRD) woke up to the occasion quite late. For the last two days, the PRD officials have been finalising one full-page advertisement on the achievements of Rabri, listing Indira Awas Yojana houses, holding of panchayat and municipal polls (though held at the behest of the Patna High Court), setting up of the state womenâ€™s commission, distribution of loans for the minority sections, literacy achievements (one of the lowest in the country), among other things.

â€œHad it been her birthday, I would have congratulated her. But there has been nothing to rejoice for during her five-year rule,â€� said leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi, insisitng that anyone in the RJD would have made a better chief minister than Rabri. Rabriâ€™s opponents maintained that Rabri rarely went to her office and functioned from 1, Anne Marg. She is being remote-controlled by her husband Laloo Prasad Yadav, they said.

16,Paswan's LJP to contest state polls,"VADODARA: In an attempt to consolidate its base in the state, the Lok Janashakti Party (LJP) will field its candidates in the ensuing Assembly polls.

The party went on an offensive against the BJP here on Thursday with its president Ramvilas Paswan demanding that the government must clarify on the exact number of people who had died during the riots in Dahod and Panchmahal districts.

Paswan, on a whirlwind tour of the state as a part of his Sadbhavna Yatra, said those working for the riot-affected had prepared a detailed list of dead in the riots in Panchmahal and Dahod districts. ""The list states that 254 persons had died. The official figure is about 50. The truth must come out. We plan to move court on this issue seeking direction to the government to issue a necessary clarification,"" Paswan said.

Paswan added that while his party was not for elections in the state at this stage, it would contest the same if they were held. The LJP will kick off a signing campaign across the state soon to muster support for its demand that polls must not be held before time.

""Our point is that the government must first rehabilitate all the persons who have been affected by the riots. Only then should it go to polls. In the meantime, President''s rule must be imposed in the state. Conducting polls at this stage would be like rewarding those people who were responsible for the riots,"" the former Union minister said.

Paswan said if the polls were held soon, his party would definitely throw its hat in the ring. ""The exact nitty-gritty of the number of seats and the candidates would be decided at a later stage. Our agenda in any case would be that of achieving social harmony and development in the state,"" Paswan said.

Terming the polls as a secondary target of his party, Paswan said that its long-term goal was cementing the Dalit-Tribal-Muslim axis in the state. ""We have been successful in doing this to a large extent in the post-riot period. The main objective would be to create awareness so that the weaker sections of the society do not become victims of negative politics,"" he said.

Regarding possible allies in the polls, Paswan said LJP would ""definitely not go with the BJP"". ""We are a small party, but have our line and goals clear, and will follow them. The bigger parties in the state can join us if they want,"" he said.

17,Govt notifies SEZ policy,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has notified the state''s policy for special economic zones (SEZs) under a government resolution which will apply to all SEZs in the state.

This includes the Kandla SEZ, Surat SEZ and proposed SEZs at Positra, Mundra and Dahej and at any other locations where SEZs may come up in Gujarat, subject to the framework for SEZ determined by the government of India (GOI) from time to time.

As per the state policy, all SEZs in the state will be declared as ''Industrial Township'' (Notified Area). The management of the SEZs will be under the designated development commissioner who will grant all the permissions as single-point clearance from his office. These will include registration of the unit, allocation of land, permission for construction of building and approval of building plan, power connection, environmental clearance, water requirement etc.

The SEZ authority will ensure continuous and quality power supply to SEZ units. SEZ developer will be permitted for arrangement of power through establishment of power project as independent power producer (IPP) as well as transmission and distribution of power. SEZ developer will approve power connections and carry out billing of units in the SEZ.

The SEZ authority may also ensure standby arrangement through establishing grid connectivity so as to draw power from Gujarat Electricity Board subject to their entering into a separate agreement with GEB on mutually acceptable terms. SEZ units shall be exempted from electricity duty for 10 years'' period, from the date of production or rendering of services. SEZ units will be granted automatic approval to set up captive power plant.

18,Wait and watch policy for Rajkot Cong chief,"RAJKOT: The Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) was in no mood to revert the high commands'' decision to appoint Mayor Ashok Dangar as the next city congress unit president, despite the fact that as many as nine corporators who were loyal to the ousted city unit president Manohersinh Jadeja have submitted their resignations.

Jadeja has been relentlessly waging a lost battle against his removal and at one stage, also claimed that as many as 26 corporators supported him-contrary to this, the figure on Wednesday stood at just nine out of which, five have expressed their willingness to support Dangar in the final run up.

The issue is with the Pradesh president Shankersinh Vaghela who said, ""there is no question of any change in leadership in Rajkot. Any change in leadership, would be dealt by the Congress high command ,who have unanimously named Dangar.""

Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel ruling out any such possibility said, ""After a lot of consideration and going by the track record of Jadeja, the party reached a decision to name a new party chief, who was young and could lead the party and take the BJP head on.""

As of now, going by the tough stance taken by the central leadership, which did not show any signs of submission to the pressure by Jadeja, the ''city Congress President'' issue was no more relevant as Dangar was unanimously appointed to lead the city unit. The Congress has a strength of 44 in the Rajkot Municipal Corporation while the BJP has 25.

At one stage the supporters of Jadeja had decided to resign but when the high command warned them and Jadeja that any such step at this juncture would signal an end to their political careers with the Congress party that they decided to hold back their decisions.

A steering committee meeting, on Wednesday morning held under the leadership of standing committee chairman Meghjibhai Rathod, was conducted peacefully. Even the standing committee meeting in the afternoon also passed off without any hitch with all the congress members present for the meeting.

When asked about the resignations of his loyalists, Jadeja said, ""I had not asked any of my supporters to resign. We were against the nomination of Dangar and we have brought this to the notice of the high command and awaiting their response."" Refusing any intentions of the party''s bifurcation he said, ""I am loyal soldier of the party and would not do indulge in such petty act. In fact I will work with more determination.""

19,Securitisation law defended,"NEW DELHI: Takeover of management control of defaulting companies will not be easy for lending banks under the Securitisation Ordinance, according to TRAI chairman and former SBI chairman MS Verma. Addressing a Ficci seminar, Verma said lenders will enforce this as a last resort as they may not be in a position to manage the company.

The fear of losing management control, failing to repay loans is highly exaggerated. â€œThis will be exercised by the banks only as a last resort,â€™â€™ Verma added.

The industry has termed certain provisions in the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security of Interest Ordinance as â€˜â€˜draconianâ€™â€™ since it allows lenders to take management control of the secured assets of defaulters without any legal hassles.

Verma also made it clear that a defaulter is a defaulter. â€˜â€˜There is no difference between a willful defaulter and an non-willful defaulter,â€™â€™ he said.

He said the Ordinance on Regulation of Securitisation is the most important legislation for the banking sector. The PSU banks are plagued by high incidence of NPAs which has reduced their profits and shareholder value. â€˜â€˜It is good for the banking system as now there is a greater risk of not paying bank loans,â€™â€™ Verma said.

Verma opined this Ordinance would increase the share value of banks and enable them to tap the capital markets and raise cheaper funds. This will create also securitisation of assets, ease formation of Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs).

Ficci president R S Lodha said there should a different treatment for wilful and non-wilful defaulters. Citing cases of Arvind Mills and TELCO, Lodha said such companies were hit by vicissitudes of business rather than a deliberate act. He felt the extra authority given to the banks on the mode of enforcement might create a new phase of aggression among the lenders. He said the legislation might affect the spirit of entrepreneurship and risk taking.

20,Junagadh bandh evokes good response,"RAJKOT: The bandh call given by the Sorath Vikas Samiti to protest against granting of municipal corporation status to Junagadh on Thursday evoked a good response.

Almost all shops and business establishments, hotels and restaurants remained closed. Roadside tea vendors and pan shops too remained closed. No untoward incident was reported from anywhere in the city.

Trade and business leaders of Junagadh feel that granting of corporation status would deprive them of several tax benefits which they are currently getting. Besides, Junagadh does not have any large industries to help sustain the economy of the city. The sarpanch of all five adjoining villages which will be merged into the city limits also supported the bandh.
