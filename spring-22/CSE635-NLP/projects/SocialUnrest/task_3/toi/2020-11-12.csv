0,Police chief's lawyer questions SIT report,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday asked S.S. Puri, chief of the Special Investigating Team SIT) investigating the Rs 3,000-crore fake-stamp-paper scam, to place his report on Mumbai police commissioner R.S. Sharma before chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde.

Sharmaâ€™s fate now rests in the CMâ€™s hands. However, senior counsel V.R. Manohar, who is representing Mr Sharma, complained that Puriâ€™s report was largely based on deputy inspector general Subodh Jaiswalâ€™s earlier report on the alleged police lapses in the scam probe.

â€œMr Jaiswalâ€™s report was distorted,â€™â€™ Mr Manohar alleged. He contended that the media was carrying on a campaign against Mr Sharma and that everyone was falsely presuming him guilty.

The HC had directed Mr Puri to probe the culpability of Mr Sharma in the scam following several PILs filed by social worker Anna Hazare and others on an improper probe into the scam.

The petitioners had alleged that several senior police officials could be hand in glove with Abdul Karim Telgi, prime accused in the scam.

Majeed Memon, Mr Hazareâ€™s counsel, said the SIT should also go through the contents of the tapes on telephone conversations between Telgi and others to corroborate the allegations of culpability against Mr Sharma.

The court also took serious note of his query regarding the non-arrest of assistant commissioner of police M C Mulani and police inspector Prakash Deshmukh despite allegations of their links with Telgi.

The duo were suspended two months ago, and Mulani subsequently retired. State advocate general Goolam Vahanvati said the SIT was actively considering the question of their arrest. However, the court ordered the SIT to hear the tapes and take action.

Wednesdayâ€™s hearing, when the SIT presented its report to the high court, took place before a packed courtroom. It also generated a little heat when advocate Vijay Thorat, who was representing one of the petitioners, suggested that deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal should not be involved in the process of selecting the new police commissioner.

Thorat said committee should be appointed by the court for this purpose. Reacting strongly to Mr Thoratâ€™s suggestion, Mr Vahanvati said this would be tantamount to asking the court to take over the functions the executive.

He drew the courtâ€™s attention to the supreme courtâ€™s recent observation in which it had said that each constitutional institution should respect the other and not cross the â€˜Lakshman rekhaâ€™.

1,People cowed down by Modi govt: Sarabhai,"MUMBAI: People across the world may have rallied round in defence of dancer Mallika Sarabhai, who has been charged by the Gujarat police in a case of duping and illegal human trafficking. But few in Gujarat have come to her support, says the Ahmedabadbased artiste.

â€œOnly the tribals and slum-dwellers, with whom I have worked, have sent me postcards of support, everyone else is silent, cowed down by the prevailing regime,â€™â€™ said an emotional Sarabhai, while addressing a press conference here on Wednesday.

The meeting was organised by several groups who believe that Sarabhai is being victimised for her stand against the Narendra Modi governmentâ€” she is the principle petitioner in a supreme court case asking for a CBI probe into the Gujarat governmentâ€™s role in the riots of last year, and seeking compensation for victims.

Activist Rohit Prajapati noted that while the Gujarat government was neglecting the riot victimsâ€™ cases, they had put a senior prosecutor on Sarabhaiâ€™s case.

Sarabhai also alleged that the Gujarat media was biased in reporting her case, and several papers had not carried her version of the story. â€œI am being crucified with lies because people donâ€™t have the time to look at the truth,â€™â€™ she said.

Writer Shobaa De said there was a â€œconspiracy of silenceâ€™â€™ in Gujarat and other states. â€œIt is time for all of us to stop minding our own business. Today, it is Mallika, tomorrow it could be anyone of us,â€™â€™ she said, adding that while Sarabhai had a platform to speak on, others did not.

The case against Sarabhai pertains to a student, Manushi Shah, who has alleged that Darpana Academy, which is Sarabhaiâ€™s institute, had promised to procure a US visa for her by including her in a dance troupe to the US.

The tour was allegedly a ruse to help students to illegally emigrate to the US, and Sarabhai was also alleged to have kept the studentsâ€™ money.

However, in a detailed press release, Sarabhai said that while the academy had taken Rs 3.1 lakh from non-professional students for a tour of folk dance festivals in Brazil and the US, under the aegis of Unesco, all the money had been returned when the tour got cancelled.

However, the tuition fee of Rs 20,000 was withheld, as it was made clear in the beginning that this was non-refundable. â€œIn fact, the FIR admits that all the money and passports have been returned,â€™â€™ said Sarabhai, â€œI am essentially accused of not aiding and abetting a crime.â€™â€™

Darpana Academy has taken students for dance tours, giving 25,000 performances in over 90 countries over 54 years. Only in one 2001 US tour, three women students disappeared but the US immigration department was immediately informed, she said.

Activists said the allegations had been brought to discredit her at the time when her petition in the supreme court was coming up for hearing. The timing also coincided with a similar case against Daler Mehndi, in order to connect the two in the public mind, they alleged.

Ramesh Pimple of the Peoples Media Initiative said that it was easy to pick on Sarabhai since she was well known.

â€œLike others who are speaking up for the riot victims and against the Modi government, she has been receiving threatening phone calls, and been gheraoed,â€™â€™ he said.

2,"Mulayam seeks Jaitley's help, Shourie for UP development","NEW DELHI: Union Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley and Union Communications Minister Arun Shourie have been invited by the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Uttar Pradesh government to address its newly-constituted Amar Singh-headed state development council on November 27.

The two Aruns, who piloted the partyâ€™s economic resolution at a recent BJP national executive meeting â€” and came in a for praise from the Prime Minister â€” are expected to speak on a subject dear to their hearts: The merits of disinvestment.

Sources said the invitation has been signed in the name of the chief secretary and the date was decided after consulting the ministers.

The invitation is seen as significant for two reasons: One, it underlines once more the SP abandoning its socialist moorings, made more than apparent by the guest list at Mulayamâ€™s swearing-in, where industrialists Anil Ambani, Adi Godrej and Subrata Roy had pride of place, as well as setting up of the UP Development Council.

3,BJP asks Cong to clear air on election ties,"HYDERABAD: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has asked the Congress to make public its poll alliance with the Telangana Rashtra Samiti.

Speaking to reporters along with state BJP general secretary K Laxman on Wednesday, party spokesperson S V Seshagiri Rao said the Congress high command offered 30 Assembly seats to the TRS.

Ironically, Rao had no clue on how many seats his party would get in bargain with the ruling Telugu Desam Party.

The former maths professor of Osmania University calculated that the Congress would also have a pre-poll understanding with the MIM.

â€œWe are not afraid of the Congress-TRS-left-MIM combine fighting elections against the BJP-TDP alliance. It helps people to chose between the two,â€� he added.

The BJP spokesperson accused the opposition parties of having divergent views on various issues.

He also asked the opposition leaders to spell out in clear terms who would head the grand alliance.

4,Constable spreads homerule terror,"LUCKNOW: Consider a police constable who over-enthusiastically executes the function of a policeman, then adorns the role of a judge and ends up giving punishment pronounced by himself.

This is what a police constable indulged in by virtue of being posted as telephone duty of a senior IAS officer of the state home department in Lucknow.

Earlier posted at Kakori police station of the state capital, Wasim was attached with the Lucknow Reserve Police Lines a few months ago after being duly shifted to Armed Police.

Then he got the opportunity to be posted as telephone duty of a home secretary, and since then he has allegedly unleashed a reign of terror particularly to favour his ''contacts''.

Recently, this police constable was at his ruthless best when he went to play saviour to a family which was fed up with local youths passing lewd remarks on girls residing in the locality.

So shaken was Wasim by the complaints of a group of three sisters about the alleged misbehaviour of local youths, that on Saturday, donning his uniform, the constable went on a rampage.

After having delt with the youths who were identified as trouble-makers by the girls, Wasim then went ahead to a ""teach a lesson"" to other locals so that they did not dare to even look at the girls anymore.

In his anger, Wasim allegedly caught hold of a doctor residing in the vicinity and thrashed him mercilessly, leaving him profusely bleeding from the nose.

This was done even when the girls and their family members emphatically insisted that the doctor was not among those who were harassing them. Having targeted the doctor, Wasim then decided to further ""fix"" the doctor and named him as the prime accused.

Repeated requests of the local Balaganj police outpost in-charge and personnel saw Wasim agitatingly challenging the authority of one and all.

The doctor has now gone underground living as a fugitive as the constable continues to swoop down at his house and search for him, despite protests from the local police.

5,NGO asks govt to spell out policy on aged,"PUNE: Instead of spending their twilight years in comfort, Indiaâ€™s senior citizens are facing a number of problems, such as dwindling income due to falling interest rates, the rising cost of living, loneliness and health problems.

Revealing this at a press conference on Tuesday, Ramanbhai Shah, president of the All-India Senior Citizensâ€™ Confederation (AISCCON), said the country had around eight crore senior citizens. He added that many of them faced neglect from their family and the government.

AISCCON is organising its third national conference with the theme, â€˜Towards well-being of eldersâ€™, on November 29 and 30 in Mumbai.

The conference will aim to study the problems faced by senior citizens and try to find effective solutions. Speakers will address issues such as preventive health care for the elderly, seeking solutions to the socio-economic marginalisation of the elderly and preventing abuse of the elderly.

Shah said AISCCON was formed in 2001 to help solve these problems through a strong senior citizensâ€™ association. He said the organisation was conducting programmes such as laughter clubs, picnics, medical checkups and a day-care centre to help ease the woes of senior citizens.

Regretting that the state government had failed to formulate a proper policy towards senior citizens, Shah hoped the state government would finalise a policy soon.

He also expressed the need for the state transport department to lower the age bar for senior citizensâ€™ concession to 60 years from the present 65 years.

Shah said the concession was presently available only in red-coloured state transport buses, and hoped that it would be extended to all public transport vehicles.

Shah suggested that the government utilise the rich experience of the senior citizens by using them as â€œtalent banksâ€�. He said senior citizens should be appointed on various government committees so that they could utilise their knowledge for the benefit of society.

6,Cong's new rule for 'delegates',"PATNA: Active participation in the party''s membership drive to achieve the target in each district has been made overarching criterion for accommodating District Congress Committee presidents as the party''s state delegate and in other capacities within the state organisation.

This transpired on Wednesday at a meeting of the DCC presidents and observers held at the Sadaquat Ashram to review the ongoing membership drive in the state. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee BPCC president Ram Jatan Sinha and observer from the Central Election Authority (CEA) of the party, Satya Behen, were among others present in the meeting.

However, a few DCC presidents urged Sinha and the central observer to extend the last date for the completion of membership drive to December 31. Sinha, on his part, said that he would inform the party''s CEA about it.

That notwithstanding, Sinha said that those concerned with membership drive would have to make at least two active members at each polling booth, while each block has to have 51 per cent members, failing which the membership drive would be stopped in the blocks concerned, Sinha said.

The party''s central observer seconded Sinha''s announcement of the criterion for accommodating DCC presidents as state delegates. She expressed satisfaction over visible enthusiasm of the partymen regarding membership drive, said the party''s state press secretary, Rajesh Kumar Sinha. On the occasion, the DCC presidents and observers, including Amarendra Singh, gave details of the drive being made.

Meanwhile, Sinha announced to resume the fifth leg of the party''s ''chalo gaon ki ore'' campaign for mass contact from Friday, when Congressmen, led by him, would start for Muzaffarpur by garlanding the idol of Lord Buddha at Pulwa Chowk at Lalganj and the statue of Gandhi at Gandhi Chowk there in the morning.

The march would conclude on November 17 with a mass meeting at Muzaffarpur and will pass through two Lok Sabha constituencies and six assembly segments. An Iftaar party was organised at the Sadquat Ashram later. The DCC presidents, observers, ex-MLAs, ex-ministers, Sinha, Satya Behen and a few ministers participated in it.

7,Early elections in Andhra for sure,"HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu is set to dissolve the assembly on Friday, paving the way for elections in February.

Over 7,000 delegates, including MPs, MLAs, politburo and state executive committee members and district unit chiefs, will participate in the general body meeting to discuss the â€œprevailing political situationâ€� in the state. at the end of the deliberations, the meeting will adopt a resolution seeking early polls.

Naidu has already discussed the issue with his Cabinet colleagues and party functionaries. The majority favours polls in February, sources say.

The Cabinet is expected to meet on Friday evening, where Naidu will explain to his colleagues the reasons for early polls.

However, some Cabinet ministers and party leaders feel the assembly should not be dissolved so soon. They feel the legislators efforts to push welfare works to impress voters will come to nought.

The chief minister is scheduled to go to Delhi on Sunday to participate in a programme organised by the World Bank and to meet Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and other important BJP leaders.

Naidu is expected to raise issues like seat-sharing with the BJP in the elections and pending projects in the state. He is likely to request some of the important BJP leaders, including the PM and the DPM to campaign in the state.

8,"Chawla, ex-mayor clash at MC meet","CHANDIGARH: The opposition staged a protest outside the municipal corporation (MC) office and inside the MC house during a meeting called by the civic body on Wednesday to discuss the imposition of property tax.

The MC house turned into a political battleground when mayor Subhash Chawla questioned former mayor Harjinder Kaur''s political affiliation.

Harjinder got annoyed at this and said that the mayor had no right to make apolitical comment in the house. She asked Chawla to take back his words.

Accusing Chawla of defaming her, Harjinder said that the mayor should have clarified this point from her before raising it in the house. Sticking to her stand, Chawla said that there was no BJPSAD alliance and because Harjinder Kaur was not an SAD member, she had no right to move any agenda on behalf of the SAD.

But opposition councillors condemned the mayor for making this statement in the house and asked him to apologise. The heated exchange between Chawla and Harjinder went on for quite sometime.

Amidst opposition and allegations, Chawla proposed to the house to vote on property tax. At this, agitated BJP councillors Kamla Sharma, Gyan Chand Gupta and Rajesh Gupta walked into the well of the house and asked for time to give their view on the issue.

As soon as the proceedings resumed, the argument started again. The mayor then announced a teabreak. The situation worsened after the tea break when Harjinder took a tough stand, saying t she would not let the house function if the mayor did not apologise.

Raising slogans of ""shame shame"", Harjinder came into the well of the house and sat on a dharna. BJP councillors also joined her. When the situation seemed to be out of control, the house was again adjourned for 10 minutes.

Finally, the property tax annulment resolution was passed while the BJP councillors and Harjinder were sitting on a dharna and raising slogans.

Earlier, while addressing the house, MP Pawan Kumar Bansal indirectly replied to the allegations levelled by former MP Satyapal Jain against him.

9,"Time ripe for IOC, ONGC disinvestment: Naik","NEW DELHI: Petroleum Minister Ram Naik said on Thursday that the present time was ripe for public offer of government equity shares in IOC and ONGC to meet the revenue deficit.

He, however, added that no decision on selling shares of IOC and the ONGC in domestic or overseas market has been taken and the proposal will have to come from the Ministry of Disinvestment.

""If funds have to be raised, (the public sale of shares of) IOC and ONGC can be done. The proposal to this effect has to first come from disinvestment ministry and, after discussions at inter-ministerial level, (it) will go to the Cabinet,"" he told reporters here.

Asked if there was a proposal to sell 20 per cent government stake in IOC and 5 per cent equity in ONGC in the market, he said, ""discussions are at different levels. When it is completed, the Ministry of Disinvestment will take it to the Cabinet for approval"".

Noting that the Rs 13,200 crore target for revenue from disinvestment proceeds was largely unmet, he said, ""stock markets are booming and it is proper time for public issue if this deficit has to be met"".

10,TDP seeks early polls in Andhra,"HYDERABAD: Seeking to cash in on the perceived sympathy for Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu after the abortive attack on him, the Telugu Desam Party on Thursday demanded early Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh on the twin planks of naxal violence and ""obstructionist"" policies of main Opposition Congress.

A resolution containing the demand was adopted unanimously at an emergency meeting of the party''s general body in the presence of Naidu by a show of hands.

""The party is seeking an early mandate on the twin planks of naxal violence and obstructionist policies of the Congress, the main Opposition,"" the political resolution said.

Observing that naxal violence was proving a major challenge to development and democracy, it said naxalites were hampering progress and development of the state by resorting to indiscriminate killing targeting people''s representatives and innocent public.

""We seek a fresh mandate from people to enable us to stamp out naxalism effectively"", the resolution said.

Development and democracy were like two eyes of the states and naxalites were trying to blind both the eyes, it said.

Accusing Congress of rank opportunism on naxal issue, the TDP faulted the Opposition party for favouring resumption of talks with PWG naxalites even after an attack on Naidu.

At a time when naxalites are on the rampage eliminating people''s representative and destroying public property, the Congress leaders were playing negative politics for narrow selfish gains and behaving as if extremism was the problem of TDP alone, it said.

Moved by Home Minister T Devendra Goud and supported by parliamentary party leader Yerran Naidu, the resolution was vetted at the party politburo meeting chaired by Naidu earlier in the day.

A meeting of the state cabinet was scheduled for November 15 to consider early polls, sources said.

11,Plea to restrain 'I' faction rally,"KOCHI: A petition has been moved in the Kerala High Court, seeking a direction to top police officials to restrain the ''I'' faction in the Congress from holding its November 19 rally as it would cause inconvenience to the public.

The petitioner, Institute of Social Welfare, Ernakulam, also sought directions to the respondents -- the state DGP and City Police Commissioner -- to restrain use of loudspeakers by those participating in the rally as it would violate the noise pollution (regulation and control) Rules, 2000.

The petitioner raised objections over the claims of the chairman of the rally''s organising committee, P P Thankachan that at least three lakh persons would participate in the rally.

If the rally was allowed, it would violate the conditions laid down by the court in its July 28, 1997 judgement for holding processions and demonstrations on city roads, the petitioner said.

13,One FIR for three riots despite 13 killings,"KALOL (PANCHMAHALS): Yunus Ismail Sheikh of Delol village in the Panchmahals had lost his wife and teenage son in the communal riots of Gujarat last year.

But he has no official document to show for their deaths, not even an FIR naming them with the police. Sheikh has been visiting the police ever since trying to get the deaths recorded but has failed. But putting the death toll on record is not the only problem here.

In fact, this is one of the few cases from last yearâ€™s violence where the police has filed a single FIR for three separate instances of rioting! Not only that, the document refuses to accept that 13 people were killed in the violence.

It records only 10. On that fateful day, more than 40 people had tried to escape from Ambica society in a tempo. According to the survivors, 13 people were killed by a mob.No minority community member has dared to enter Ambica Society since then.

Yunus has approached the Kalol police station on four different occasions insisting that 13 people were killed, including his wife, Zubeda and son Hafiz in the incident. But the police, he says, shooed him away saying they would not make any modifications in the FIR.

This despite the fact that he can recognise all the people who had attacked them. The FIR at the police station by senior police sub-inspector R J Patil accuses â€˜a faceless mobâ€™ and acknowledges â€˜10 deathsâ€™.

Surprisingly, this FIR clubs together the rioting cases at Rabbani Masjid in Botha Bazar and Boru village near Kalol. The Kalol police did not care to file a separate FIR in the Rabani Masjid rioting where one person was killed.

The victim, who had sustained a bullet injury, was being taken to the referral hospital in a tempo when a mob attacked. Setting the vehicle on fire they burnt him alive.

Boru village, on the other hand, had cases of arson. Meanwhile, on the basis of this unique FIR the police has arrested Sailesh Kumar Ambala and Ramesh Kumar Parmar. But surprisingly Yunus says, â€œI never saw the two in the mob which attacked us.â€�

â€œIt was only after I approached higher officials and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) that inspector Patil approached me at the Kalol relief camp to take my statement. This happened one-and-a-half month after the incident. But by then there was not an iota of evidence left at the spot of crime,â€� laments Yunus.

â€œThe reason for not recording my complaint has not been justified yet,â€� said Yunus, who has named Sheetal Patel a clerk at Peopleâ€™s Bank, J P Shah the manager at Peoples Bank, Bimalkumar Narendra Suttar the owner of Vijay Talkies and Vijay Thakur the owner of Khodiyar Pan Centre as those who led the deadly mob.

All the accused were arrested after Yunusâ€™s statement only to be released on bail later.

â€œAs there was no proper investigation done by the police, I have filed an application before the fast track court at Godhra to order a re-investigation into the case,â€� Yunus added.

When asked about why three incidents were clubbed in a single FIR, investigating officer and Halol circle police inspector B D Rana said, â€œI have been asked to investigate the case recently. I was on sick leave and have not gone through the details of the case.â€� Meanwhile, despite numerous efforts the district superintendent of police Manoj Antani and the then district collector, Jayanti Ravi could not be contacted.

14,TDP blows election bugle,"HYDERABAD: While Lord Krishna had to face one demon Shishupal, the Telugu Desam Party was faced with two power hungry demons, the Congress and other opposition parties on one side and the Naxals on the other who were preventing the government from going ahead with its agenda of development.

Sri Krishna could kill Shishupal after 100 mistakes but being a democratic party, TDP had only one option and that was to place the matter before the people and seek their verdict on whom they prefer.

This was the quintessence of the political resolution moved by the Telugu Desam at its mini-mahanadu. Moving the political resolution, minister for home T. Devender Goud spit fire against the Congress and the TRS.

The resolution was passed amidst whistles and slogan-shouting. The nearly 7000 party workers and delegates were ecstatic as the resolution was put to voice vote. Party president Chandrababu Naidu said the cabinet would meet on Friday and adopt resolution to dissolve the assembly.

15,"Assembly polls: Sadhvi, princess in leaky boat","NEW DELHI: The BJP''s chief ministerial candidate for Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharati, is reportedly planning to contest from more than one consituency.

This comes after the Samajwadi Party, in an effort to beat her, withdrew its candidate in Bada Malhera in favour of a strong candidate that the CPI has fielded here.

She had initially filed her nomination papers only from Bada Malhera in Chhatarpur district, a constituency held by her brother, Swami Prasad Lodhi.

Party sources say she is now considering two other seats - Datia in Datia district from where her aide Awdhesh Nayak has filed papers, and Chandala, also in Chhatarpur, from where the BJP has fielded Mohammad Ghani Ansari.

Datia was Uma''s first choice as it is the seat of the Pitambara Peeth, and she was hoping to cash in on the religiosity of the area''s voters, say sources.

But if Uma is weighing her options on the eve of the last day of filing nominations, the BJP''s chief ministerial candidate in neighbouring Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje, has already decided to play safe. In addition to Jhalrapatan, she will also be contesting from Pilawa.

Both the assembly seats are in her Lok Sabha constituency of Jhalawar, from where she has been consistently winning.

In Chhattisgarh, where the BJP does not have a chief ministerial candidate, its leader in the assembly, Nand Kumar Sai, is contesting both from his own seat of Tapkara as well as from Marwahi, where he will be pitted against chief minister Ajit Jogi.

Sai is a Kanwar tribal, which has a sizable vote in Marwahi. In Marwahi, the BJP line will be ""asli tribal"" versus ""nakli tribal"" - a reference to the accusations levelled by the BJP against Jogi that he is really not a tribal.

It''s only in Delhi that the BJP''s chief ministerial candidate, Madanlal Khurana, will contest from one seat - Moti Nagar.
