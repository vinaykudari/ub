0,V-C seeks govt help to bail out farm sector,"LUDHIANA: Punjab Agricultural University vicechancellor KS Aulakh, on Friday, stressed on the need for liberal government assistance to pull the farming sector out of stagnation to provide conducive environment enabling farmers to compete in the increasingly competitive world market.

Addressing a large gathering of farmers on the concluding day of the two-day kisan mela, Aulakh pointed out that against Rs 2,900 subsidy to an Indian farmer, Canada, USA and EU on average provide 9,000, 21,000 and 17,000 dollars annual subsidy to their farmers, respectively.

He observed that problems like degradation of soil health, depletion of underground water, environmental pollution, toxic residue in the farm produce contributing to dwindling income of farmers.

Creation of adequate marketing infrastructure, dissemination of of market related information, judicious use of fertilisers and pesticides, afforestation, facilities for post-harvest handling and processing of perishable products can help put agriculture on the right track, he suggested.

He reiterated the need to give thrust to diversification to counter the challenges of agriculture. He called for the setting up of meat processing plants in the state to capitalise on its increasing demand and export potential.

The sale figure of seeds touched Rs 35 lakh while sale of farm literature fetched about Rs 3 lakh. Well-known Punjabi singers enthralled the audience at the main venue.

A 10-member Nigerian delegation also visited the mela to study its organisation and to equip with the knowledge about latest farming techniques and farm machinery displayed at the exhibition.

The winners of different farm produce competitions were given prizes at the function.

1,"VB treads lightly on ex-minister, indicts two IAS officers","CHANDIGARH: The Vigilance Bureau inquiry into the multi-crore tree felling scam in Mirzapur, in which Harbans Lal was sacked as forest minister and senior IAS officer Dharamvir was suspended, has observed that while there was no evidence to establish that the former minister had indulged in corrupt practice, the onus of administrative irregularities committed in the forest department was primarily on two IAS officers, R P S Pawar and Dharamvir.

The Vigilance Bureau report, submitted to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh recently, recommended that departmental inquiry be initiated against the two senior IAS officers along with three forest department officials.

The report, however, holds the former minister responsible for committing administrative irregularity by granting extension to the forest contractor, but nowhere does it indicate that money influenced the minister in taking the wrong decision.

Instead Pawar, who was administrative secretary to Harbans Lal, has been held responsible for ""keeping the minister in the dark about facts"".

Pawar has been found lacking in performing his administrative duty of apprising the minister of adverse fall-outs of the controversial decision.

The report has also recommended departmental inquiry against Dharamvir as he granted extension in time period for felling trees to Lachman Singh''s son, who did not hold the licence for the purpose.

While suggesting that a criminal case be registered against Lachman Singh, his son and four forest department officials, for conniving with him, the officials reportedly colluded with the forest contractor at one stage for not imposing heavy penalty on Lachman Singh after he undertook illegal felling of trees in 2001.

Instead of forfeiting his Rs 30 lakh security, a token penalty of Rs 13 lakh was imposed while also allowing him to take away the illegally felled trees.

The report, which may not be much to the liking of the chief minister, who had unceremoniously sacked Harbans Lal, is likely to create new complications with another senior IAS officer being put in the dock.

Moreover, it is also expected to question the propriety of sacking a minister on the ground of administrative irregularity which, however, had no financial implications in terms of loss to the state or otherwise.

2,"For girls, PU polls mean just a weeks' activity","CHANDIGARH: In the otherwise politically alienated girls hostels in the Panjab university, the talk of political parties and the presidential candidates contesting in students elections has suddenly become a hot issue.

However, the councils elections for majority of the female students on the campus mean just a week being occupied in discussing politics.

Majority of the girls concede that despite having no inclination with political ideology, its only a week before elections that they begin to spare a thought for the student parties and the leaders. After the elections the talk about the political parties and the leaders simply dies down.

""In the name of elections, the girls just get involved a few days before the elections, especially after the presidential candidates start paying visits to the hostels. Before that no one is really clear who to vote for and what the major issues should be before the elections,"" says Poonam of the department of Fine Arts and residing in Kasturba hostel.

""Though the girls are pretty enthusiastic about the elections, the criteria for choosing the candidates are more governed by which way the peer group is going. No one really cares about what the parties what to achieve as every year the promises are similar,"" says Taruna of MCA.

""Here, girls help candidates in making the huge banners and posters which are later on displayed in the hostel walls. But the entire craze lasts for only a few days as after the elections are over, no one later on talks about it,"" observes another student.

Addressing reporters here, he also said the government should not take a decision on recommending a CBI probe into the incident just by hearing the views of the BJP. Talks should be held with Muslim organisations also, he said.

On Ernakulam by-poll, Muraleedharan said he had not noticed moves from any section in the party that would hamper the winning prospects of the official nominee.

4,"Credit card racket busted, 4 arrested","NEW DELHI: With the arrest of four persons, the northwest police claimed to have solved a case of car theft, purse snatching and credit card misuse. The police added that seven vehicles stolen by the accused had also been recovered after their arrest.

A Vikas Puri resident, Ranny Rajan, had reportedly informed the police about the theft of her purse containing an ICICI bank credit card, a camera, and some documents. The woman received a bill from the bank in August stating that Rs 40,000 had been charged to her credit card. The matter was reported at the Vikas Puri police station.

The credit card statement revealed that the accused had purchased a mobile phone and a SIM card using a fake driving licence as proof of identity. The police reportedly received a tip off that the accused were also in the possession of some stolen vehicles and would possibly buy fuel from a petrol pump near Najafgarh road. All the four accused, aged between 20 and 22 years, were arrested along with one stolen car near the AG 1 block bus stop on Najafgarh road on Tuesday.

5,"Dacoity averted, five arrested","NEW DELHI: With the arrest of five people on Friday, the east district police are claiming to have averted a dacoity in the Seelampur area. The police reportedly seized two locally made pistols, two live cartridges and four knives from the accused.

According to the police, the accused were members of the Sonu Pandit gang. Pandit was recently killed following an encounter with the Uttar Pradesh (UP) police. â€˜â€˜Acting on a tip-off, we constituted a special team which conducted a raid and nabbed the accused,â€™â€™ said additional deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Anurag Kumar. The police have booked the accused under the Arms Act.

During interrogation, the accused told the police that they were planning to rob a jeweller and that their gang leader was shot dead in an encounter with UP police at Meerut last month.

The scooter had allegedly been stolen from the Chandni Chowk area. The main accused, Shan Mohammed, had been arrested earlier in a case under the Arms Act. The police said that efforts are being made to arrest the remaining members of the gang. In another incident in west Delhi, the police nabbed four alleged bus robbers in the Patel Nagar area. DCP (west) Satish Golcha said that two cases of bus robbery were solved with the arrest.

6,More students' turnout for DUSU elections,"NEW DELHI: At 45 per cent, votersâ€™ turnout at the DUSU poll on Friday recorded a marginal increase over last yearâ€™s figure. The polling, meanwhile, was completed peacefully amidst heavy police deployment.

The counting will begin at 8 am on Saturday and the results will be declared by 1 pm on the same day. Most intra-college election results were declared on Friday evening. However, students of some colleges alleged that there were irregularities in the poll process. In Satyawati College in northwest Delhi, there was an altercation between members of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) and Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

Bharti college students alleged that the polling for their internal college elections had been halted for 30 minutes. Monika Malhotra, a candidate who contested for the post of secretary alleged that her ballot number was changed from 10 to 6.

While the north campus witnessed a rather lukewarm response (30 per cent), there was heavier voting in south and west campus colleges. In Shraddhanand College, where there had been a huge turnout last year, barely 50 per cent students had turned up to vote. The polling was heavy in Dayal Singh evening and Desbandhu colleges â€” in the first 600 votes were polled in the first hour itself. In colleges like Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma, the turnout was low â€” 800 students of the total 2,000 turned up.

Interestingly, students were more interested in their college elections than the DUSU polls. The disillusionment is obvious. â€˜â€˜We have voted for the group that is at least raising some serious issues. Issues like changing syllabus can wait but the DUSU should at least address basic issues like U-specials and safety of women on campus,â€™â€™ said Suranjana, a second-year student of Hindu college.

In the college elections, better allocation of funds and opening a bus pass counter are some of the major issues in Hindu. In Ramjas, organising the college festival was the top concern. â€˜â€˜We havenâ€™t had a college festival for the two years because of infighting between groups. This is a popular event,â€™â€™ Sunny Dabas, a second-year student said.

7,‘Daddy fear’ to stalk LU elections,"LUCKNOW: The average student of Lucknow University fears that the campus will once again become the playground â€˜professionalâ€™ student leaders, in the wake of the state governmentâ€™s decision lift the age bar of 25 years for contesting the studentsâ€™ union elections.

They also feel that the â€˜academic standardsâ€™ of the student leaders and the student polity as a whole will suffer as a consequence of the lifting of the restriction on students who failed or dropped a year in a class, as per the amendments announced by the state government, in the 2000 studentsâ€™ union reforms. Particularly now, with 60 per cent students on campus being girls, the primary concern is one of law and order on campus.

The fear of the students appears to be genuine, when considered in the light of the fact that barring one occasion in 2000-01, the last 10 presidents of the LU Studentsâ€™ Union (Lusu) were between the age group of 35-40 years. Students say that at this age, student leaders appear more like â€˜daddiesâ€™ rather than students.

Furthermore, most of these student leaders are â€˜professionalsâ€™ staying put at the university, procuring admission to various courses and dropping years, with the sole interest of contesting elections. â€œThey use Lusu as a launch pad for their political careers,â€� said a student, adding that the Lusu elections are mere a farce in the name of a democratic set-up.

For example, 90 per cent of the over Rs 10-12 lakhs collected under the studentsâ€™ union fund â€” by charging each student Rs 60 â€” was spent on organising worthless symposiums and felicitation ceremonies, in which political leaders were called as chief guest by these student leaders to get close to them.

Political parties also openly sponsored candidates in exchange for the â€˜muscle powerâ€™ provided by them for the Assembly and Parliamentary elections.

Not surprisingly, between 1990-2000, Lusu twice felicitated SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav with an honorary membership of the studentsâ€™ union, while BSP chief Mayawati was similarly honoured once.

In 50s and 60s and even in the 80s, Prime Ministers like JL Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi; noted educators; chiefs of army staff, freedom fighters like Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, were also conferred with similar honours.

Seeing such a blatant misuse of the student polity, election reforms were brought in 2000, in the wake of hectic debates and popular demand from the students. The general student had lost interest in the studentsâ€™ union elections and the turnout during last 10 elections would be a mere 15-20 per cent.

The participation of girl students was a mere 3-5 per cent. There have been cases when such student leaders have kept themselves present at LU for over 10-15 years â€” if only to fight the elections.

Ad there are no restrictions on the number of attempts for a post, two student leaders â€” both prominent SP leaders now â€” contested on 4-6 occasions for the post of president of the union, before finally being elected.

A senior professor of LU noted that the studentâ€™s union elections have become an affair centred around the LU hostel residents who incidentally, represent 15 per cent of the total student population at LU.

The elections have also been reduced to a â€˜war for supremacyâ€™, leading to violence and bloodshed among rival student groups, he said. Student leaders used to behave like Mafioso, sheltering rowdy elements, even supporting them with monetarily.

Big money is involved in the elections as most student leaders flash fancy four-wheelers and the latest cell phones and are reputed to spend over Rs 5 lakh for each presidential election. Most of this money is raised through extortion and the contract business.

Money is splurged on putting together fleet of cars, expensive cards distributed among the students and on canvassing material.

Funds are also utilised to invite political leaders campaign for contestants, wantonly brandish firearms, and ensure a freeflow of liquor, to catch the fancy of students.

8,Buddha warns Centre to keep off Bengal's education policy,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee slammed the ""RSS-dictated education policy of the Centre"" on Friday, and said that the state would decide its own education policy based on progressive development of science and technology, and not religion.

Addressing the Teachers'' Day function at Rabindra Sadan, Bhattacharjee said, ""Educational policies will be drafted independently by the state without interference by the Centre. We want to emerge as centres of excellence, maintaining the progressive tradition of Bengal.""

The chief minister stressed the need for modernising madrasah education and said that new policies had been adopted by the state to ""upgrade and improve the curriculum"".

""We have set up 38 engineering colleges in the state with the help of private investments in education,"" he added.

The state government felicitated 15 retired teachers at the function, where school education minister Kanti Biswas admitted it was a ""great shame"" for the state government that it hadn''t been able to pay teachers'' pension on time.

Some teachers'' organisations, however, stayed away from the Teachers'' Day celebrations organised by the government.

Members of the Bengal Primary Teachers'' Association participated in a daylong demonstration at Esplanade to protest against the ""anti-teacher and anti-education policy"" of the government.

Around 20,000 members of the Secondary Teachers'' and Employees Association attended their own programmes in the districts.

9,"Ragging rules on Net, yet ISI didn't see it","KOLKATA: A fresher at Indian Statistical Institute,who was brutally ragged last month, would have been spared the torture if the ISI authorities had kept track of a Supreme Court directive on ragging, easily available on the net.

The ISI is only now implementing the SC orders, which could have proved an effective deterrent if enforced earlier.

The Indian Institute of Technology, for instance, managed to put a lid on the menace by promptly implementing the SC regulations, which hold out severe punishment for ragging.

Sixteen ISI students had been found guilty in the physical ragging of a first year student on August 7. Four of them were suspended and the rest severely reprimanded.

If the SC directive had been enforced at ISI, the guilty students could have faced imprisonment and a fine of Rs 25,000 each.

Besides, the SC says that all students who are punished for ragging would have it mentioned in their gradesheets as a ""permanent blot"".

The ISI dean of studies, G M Saha said that the institute authorities have thoroughly gone through the directives on the Internet.

""We learnt about the directives while probing the incident.A copy of it was submitted along with the report and from now on, the directives will be strictly followed,"" said Saha. ""The guidelines will make it easier for us to take action against the culprits.""

The ISI could do well to look to ISI Kharagpur where the authorities make students take a pledge not to rag freshers, and also put up posters to inform them what lay in store if they reneged on the pledge.

The SC directive is significant because it makes the institute responsible to stop ragging. Institute that fail to curb the menace would be deprived of funds from external agencies as a punitive measure.

And employees,who had been entrusted with preventing ragging, should also be hauled up, the SC says.

11,HC dismisses plea challenging govt grant for conference,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka High Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by a city-advocate challenging the granting of Rs 12 lakh for a state level conference to be held on September 27 by the Chief Minister.

N.P. Amrutesh, stated in his petition that the CM had ordered to grant Rs 12 lakh for the state level conference following a letter from the Karnataka State Government Employees Association on September 14.

The petitioner contended that the grant was unnecessary as the state was reeling under severe drought and the grant was a political gimmick. Moreover, a delegation fee of Rs 100-200 was being collected for the conference and there was no need for the grant.

12,Communal violence revisits Godhra,"VADODARA: Communal violence broke out in the sensitive Godhra town on Friday evening, injuring some eight persons, including policemen.

A curfew was imposed in five police chowky areas of the town falling along the route of the Ganesh immersion procession, even as police opened fire and lobbed teargas shells to disperse stone-pelting mobs.

Stray incidents of arson were also reported from the sensitive railway station area where the notorious train carnage of February 27, 2002, had unleashed a wave of reprisals across Gujarat.

Although the police was on high alert since all the Ganesh idols â€” 86 of them â€” were to be immersed on Friday, curfew had to be imposed to get the situation under control after the stonepelting continued despite the teargas shelling.

A railway police sub-inspector fired four rounds in the air when a mob collected near the railway station and resorted to violence.

â€œTrouble started near the Rani Masjid area of Polan Bazaar when the 51st Ganesh idol was on its way for immersion,â€� said Spl IG (Vadodara range) Rakesh Asthana. Members of each community claimed that the other started the stone-pelting, he added.

The incident took place at about 5 pm, when the processions to immerse Ganesh idols in the Ramsagar pond were being taken out, and violence continued till late in the evening. Five private persons and three policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, were injured in the rioting.

A journalist is also said to be among those injured while one person, hit by a teargas shell, was badly wounded and was sent to Vadodara for further treatment.

The processions were passing through areas which were minority dominated and the police was already on tenterhooks since Thursday, with an additional SRP company was rushed in since the immersion coincided with Friday, a prayer day for Muslims.

In fact, members of the minority community welcomed the processions at Polan Bazar, but peace was shattered when those in the procession played loud music and raised slogans, said sources.

Some 30 teargas shells were lobbed, even as some Ganesh idols were abandoned as the crowds dispersed. Curfew was imposed in areas under chowkies 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7, said Asthana.

The two officers-in-charge are accused for assaulting Shamsher Singh and his family members by entering his house on April 3, 2002, during which Singh had sustained grievous injuries. They were assisted by 10 policemen in their act of assault.

14,CPM pushes for party probity,"KOLKATA: Alimuddin Street bosses are determined to stem the rot that has set in within the CPM. The party will now issue strict directives to its units, asking them to give top priority to completing investigations against erring workers and leaders.

In the past, many such inquiries â€” be it the promoter-politician nexus in the controversial Beni Engineering case or allegations of gross public misconduct by a prominent district party leader â€” took an unusually long time.

Now, the party bosses will brook no sluggishness in conducting inquiries.

According to the CPM state secretariat, the district unit leadership will have to immediately summon those party members against whom complaints have been filed to check the veracity of the claims.

If there is any substance in the complaint, the district party leadership will have to set up an inquiry committee and complete the job without delay.

If the charges against the party members are proved to be true, higher committees of the organisation will take instant action. The directive will be issued to the CPM''s district units soon after the next state committee meeting slated for later this month.

The directive also clarifies that if there is any complaint against a partyman for owning property disproportionate to his income, the party unit leadership will interrogate him immediately and take stern action if the charges are proved to be true.

This move follows reports of a section of partymen misusing their clout to their own financial advantage. The state secretariat also favour a threadbare discussion at all levels on the ""lack of principles and mistakes by a section of the partymen.""

CPM insiders say that the state committee at its next meeting will finalise the date from when such discussion in the party units from branch committees to the district committees will start.

One of the major reasons for the organisational ills today is the violation of the principle of democratic centralism by a significant number of partymen.

This is precisely why, the party state secretariat has decided to take steps to ensure that this principle is followed in letter and spirit by the organisation''s rank and file.

The state committee members will be first among the partymen to be asked to strictly follow this, a senior party leader said.

15,Confusion mars the broadband party,"NEW DELHI: The big fat pipes have landed. Broadband - or high-speed Internet access between 64Kbps and 2Mbps - has become a reality for consumers and companies in the metros. But too many players and options - along with patchy access speeds - threaten to spoil the broadband party for the consumer.

Not only are players like Satyam, Reliance, Dishnet, Bharti pushing the pace, the neighbourhood cable man has joined the fray by buying bandwidth directly from the big boys. However, 90 per cent of 3.5 million subscribers to ISPs use dial-up services.

Confused by numerous options, consumers are freezing their broadband decisions. What is not helping matters is the absence of a regulatory mechanism - consumers have nowhere to go in case there is any problem with the service. That matters as, most often, the cableman is the interface between large players and the end subscriber.

Moreover, consumers just aren''t getting access speeds as they are normally pushed together in a shared network. ""It''s frustrating. Sometimes you just keep watching the rotating explorer,"" says R Pradeep, a Mayur Vihar resident. In some cases, consumers don''t want to give up their MTNL connections - despite better deals from private telephony players like Reliance and Bharti.

Service providers claim that Net users see rising phone bills as a powerful push factor to migrate to always-on broadband Internet connections. Indeed. While the dial-up connection costs Rs 36 per hour, flexible broadband pack are as cheap as Rs 7 to 10 per hour.

The industry adds that flexibility of bandwidth usage and pricing is the biggest pull factor for broadband. ""More and more people are going in for broadband packs. It''s the new killer application,"" says Sanjay Dwivedi, CEO Spectranet Ltd.

Industry watchers agree that many consumers are unable to decide what broadband package to go in for. ""The change has started happen in a slow manner,"" says one. For now, the focus is on corporate and posh residential societies. The industry is confident that demand will pick up as service improves.

17,"Authorities flouting rules, polluting Gomti","LUCKNOW: When the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) itself starts dumping solid waste into the river, little wonder then that the Gomati is termed as a dead river.

Taking cognizance of this violation of the law, the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Friday slapped a notice on the LMC for dumping solid waste near the Gandhi Setu and polluting the Gomati river.

The notice terms this as ''improper and illegal'' and the UPPCB has asked LMC to furnish it''s reply within 10 days, otherwise stringent action will be taken against the department.

For the last two months LMC has been using the Gomati as a convenient dumping ground in complete disregard for the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000, framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

Even as the government is pumping in crores of rupees to clean the Gomati, the dichotomy is that the LMC is working equally hard to keep it polluted. UPPCB''s member secretary C S Bhatt said that the LMC was dumping waste not only at Gandhi Setu but also at the Shaheed Smarak and this must be stopped immediately.

18,Gujrat's finance minister slams Modi,"AHMEDABAD: In what is being interpreted as his first discordant note vis-a-vis chief minister Narendra Modi, state finance minister Vajubhai Vala told newspersons on Thursday, ""All bearded persons are not Shyamji Krishnavarma.""

Vala, the seniormost minister after Modi, is a known protege of ex-CM Keshubhai Patel, the chief political opponent of Modi in the BJP. Vala had opposed the removal of Keshubhai as CM back in October 2001.

Talking informally with reporters who met him in his chamber, Vala said, ""There is nothing unnatural about two individuals differing in ideas and physique."" The senior minister, however, refused to elaborate. Vala''s remark came when he was reminded by a reporter that both revolutionary freedom fighter, Shyamji''s portrait circulated by the officialdom with the CM''s aproval and that of Modi remarkably looked alike.

Not enthused by the preparations for the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat business summit, Vala said going abroad for attracting investment was different from actually getting it. His remark came in reply to a question whether he thought the Arab Sheikhs would invest in Gujarat after the recent visit of law minister Ashok Bhatt to several West Asian cities.

The Cabinet''s No 2, Vala has not been involved in Vibrant Gujarat. Known to be media friendly, Vala has lately been keeping a low profile. Unlike other ministers, he evades coming up with press notes on the condition of the state''s finances, though the exchequer has been in the plus ever since April 2003.

To a question, whether there was enough money to spare for developmental work, he declared, ""We as finance department are never at a loss. We just have to say ''No'' to any demand if we have no money.""

Asked whether the state would be implementing the recent Central announcement for giving four per cent dearness allowance (DA) to government employees, Vala refused to suggest a possibility. ""The Cabinet will have to decide on the matter"", he said, adding, ""In case we decide to do that, then the burden would be to the tune of Rs 400 crore, at the rate of Rs 100 crore each percentage rise in DA.""

19,Gujrat prohibition law to be amended,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has decided to amend the state''s prohibition law in an attempt to relax the rules for those trading in ''raw gur and ammonia chloride'', two liquor ingradients.

The Cabinet this Monday gave its nod to the Bombay Prohibition (Gujarat amendment) Bill, 2003, to be placed as one of the nine bills before the Gujarat state assembly, to start its four day session on September 9.

While the reason for suddenly coming up with the amendment is not known, officials in the legal and parliamentary affairs department say, the traders in the two commodities faced considerable harassment by officials of the state prohibition department. This led state home and prohibition minister Amit Shah to decide to go in for amending it.

The traders are learnt to have represented to Shah some time back.

The government would also come up with the Protection of Interset of Despositors in Financial Establishments Bill, 2003, in an attempt to impose up to Rs 10 lakh fine and six years'' imprisonment against those running non-banking financial institutions and found guilty in fleecing their customers.

It would help stop ""immoral activities"", said a department source.

A third bill related with amending the laws related with state SC and OBC corporations. The bill will allow one woman as director in each of the two corporations. There are in all 15 directors in each of them. Yet another bill seeks to have new laws for regulating the marriage bureaus. while making marriage registration compulsory.

Party loyalty or ideology is not at a premium here as many have not been long enough in one party for these debilities to develop. Much of Mayawati''s present BSP is drawn from an assorted mix of parties big - Congress et al - and small - Apna Dal, Rashtriya Parivartan Dal et al.

Following Mayawati''s mathematics of one MLA''s support equal to a ministerial berth may be impossible for Mulayam Singh, but the professional ministers lining up deserve a fair chance. There is even precedence at the Centre, after all. Bihar leader Ram Vilas Paswan has an impeccable record. He has served as Union Minister under four prime ministers of various political hues. V P Singh and Vajpayee probably have only one thing in common politically. Ministers like Paswan.

Mamata Banerjee who has served as minister both in a Congress and a BJP regime has taken professionalism to another level - specialisation. Only the Railway Minister''s post is acceptable as she has experience in that field. There are more.

Why not? If Baichung Bhutia and I M Vijayan can play professional football for Mohun Bagan one season and East Bengal the next, and without having their loyalties questioned, why can''t Tripathi and co. It is all about possessing the required skill sets. Arguably, those who know the game are best equipped to play it. And the politics of coalition is a tricky game.

Professional coalition ministers have work experience. They know the art of balance, of juggling rhetoric to suit the occasion depending on who their leader is today, of unabashedly lavishing praise upon the same person they criticised bitterly last week. They know how to move fast in the department and get work done, conditioned as they are to changing political equations and quick reshuffles. They know how the system works - they are the system.

The professionals are not bogged down by unnecessary baggage like credibility or ideology. Their imperatives to remain in power are real - in UP, at any given time and in any political combination, there are hundreds of criminal cases between the various ministers. And when the average government seems to last a year or less, they provide invaluable continuity. Also those maintaining government records need not go into a frenzy digging up new details.

It could work most effectively. Governments could change, but the professional minister could just forward an application requesting change in nomenclature of party. Apart from money saved to furnish homes and offices to suit the next man''s taste and accommodate his flunkeys (and their diverse tastes), ministry work, if any, could continue uninterrupted.

22,BJP dismisses Left protest over Sharon visit,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday dismissed as ""rhetoric and ritual"" the Left parties'' protest against Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon''s visit beginning Monday.

""The protest by Left parties against the visit by the Israeli Prime Minister is a typical Left rhetoric and ritual even when the world scenario has changed and Palestinians too have entered into agreement with Israel. What would the Leftists do when Sharon is invited by Russia and China,"" party spokesman Prakash Javadekar told reporters here.

He said no public issue was involved in this visit and the left parties were protesting because they are opposed to anything from Israel.

""How would Leftists explain the visit to Israel by veteran Left leader Jyotii Basu. Why didn''t they object to it,"" he asked.

23,PU polls: ABVP joins hands with HPSU,"CHANDIGARH: Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarathi Parishad entered into an alliance with Himachal Pradesh Students Union on Friday for the Panjab University Students'' Council elections, which are to take place on September 12. This first alliance among the political parties on the campus assumes importance as the HPSC last year had allied with PUSU, which had emerged victorious in the students'' council elections.

ABVP has already declared Saurabh Joshi as the Presidential candidate for the forthcoming elections and the alliance with HPSC would not affect the position, as Joshi would fight for the post of president. However, the other posts of vice president, general secretary would be shared but the panel has so far not been declared by the alliance.

The manifesto too is yet to be finalised by the party. Going by the strength of the community on the campus, the HPSC activists claim to have a student support base of around 1000 votes in PU. But the observers on the campus point out that the HPSC has factions within and the party is actually divided into three groups. It is the faction led by Deepak Singh Rawat, which has agreed to fight the elections with ABVP, while the two factions may go independently with PUSU (Shelley) and SOPU.

While last year, Haryana Students Association and HPSC both had an alliance with the PUSU, which emerged victorious over the nearest rival SOPU and Association of Panjab University Students Alliance. This year however, the HSA so far is talking about fighting the elections on its own and has already declared Pawan Singh Gahlawat as its presidential candidate. PUSU is going ahead with Malwinder Singh Kang who would contest the council''s election for the third time in a row. Commenting on the last years council, HPSU''s Rawat said, ""The outgoing students council was not able to safeguard interests of the students community and its only agenda was to project the image of an individual and never took the allies into confidence before taking any decision.''''

24,New rules laid down for academia,"NEW DELHI: Almost 40 per cent of teaching positions in universities and colleges in India have been lying vacant for years.

Thereâ€™s no money to fill up these posts. So what do you do? Scrap some, and fill the rest with contractual teachers at half, even one-fourth, the normal salaries. Maharashtra, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Orissa governments have directed universities and colleges under their jurisdiction to hire teachers only on contract.

These appointments vary between 10-40 per cent. The trend is growing as teachers retire and are replaced by contractual ones. Orissa, for example, had a freeze on recruitment since 1996. â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s just been lifted. Of the posts lying vacant, 85 have been abolished and 37 cleared for fresh appointment, all on contract salaries â€” Rs 15,000 for professors, Rs 12,000 for Readers and Rs 10,000 for lecturers,â€™â€™ says Prof Pandav Nayak, V-C, Utkal University.

Academics see this as a disturbing trend. â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s another instance of implementing on the sly, a controversial recommendation of the Birla-Ambani Report on Education. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before professors in prestigious universities will be hired and fired at will,â€™â€™ warns Prof Kapil Kumar, former president, Federation of Central University Teacherâ€™s Association.

In most institutions, lecturers are being hired on contract. In some cases, professors and readers too. The tenures vary â€” from three years, in universities and government colleges, to nine months in private and government-aided institutions. On paper they share the same 18 hours a week workload of permanent appointees, but are often made to do more. â€˜â€˜Salaries of lecturers could be anything from Rs 10,000 to Rs 3,000. In AP, contract teachers in government- aided colleges are paid Rs 1,040.

Most have not cleared the NET exam (UGCâ€™s minimum qualification for lecturers) â€˜â€™ says B. Vijay Kumar, general secretary, AlI India Federation of University and College Teachers. â€˜â€˜Tamil Nadu has issued a circular that in future all appointments are to be on contract,â€™â€™ says B N Parthasarthy, former principal of MTN College, Madurai. What is the rationale? â€˜â€˜Policy-makers argue that permanent appointment brings complacency, contractual tenures would improve performance, create marketable skills. But itâ€™s not the best way to bring efficiency,â€™â€™ says Nayak.

Sanjay Bohidar, member, DUTA executive agrees: â€˜â€˜Academia that is constantly afraid of losing its livelihood is inimical to excellence. As it is, teaching no longer attracts the best talent. Insecurity will further erode it.â€™â€™ Kumar say this is being done under WTO pressure to reduce subsidy in education. Whatever the reason, there seems little justification for it. Kapil Kumar points out: â€˜â€˜This blatant replication of the American model of the contract system would be justified only if Indian professors are as well-paid and well-looked after as their American counterpart.â€™â€™
