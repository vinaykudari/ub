1,Central govt will launch Janani Suraksha Yojana,"MUMBAI: The Union government is launching from April 11 the â€œJanani Suraksha Yojanaâ€� with an aim to bringing down the high mortality rate among women during pregnancy and at the time of delivery and reducing child mortality, Union health minister Sushma Swaraj said here on Saturday.

â€œAt present, 460 of every one lakh women die during pregnancy, while 66 new-borns and very young children out of 1,000 births succumb to some or other ailments,â€� Swaraj said while speaking as the chief guest at an â€˜Arogya Melaâ€™ organised at Dharavi by the health ministry, Indian Medical Association and the Brihanmumbai municipal corporation.

Under the scheme, pregnant women will be registered at pre-natal care centres from the third month of conception and will be guided for taking proper food and undertaking exercises during pregnancy, the minister said. An incentive of Rs 150 each would be given to women bringing pregnant women to hospitals for delivery, Swaraj said. The Arogya Mela in the heart of Asiaâ€™s biggest slum will help spread the message of health and hygiene, the minister said.

Swaraj, along with Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi, who inaugurated the mela, went around a number of stalls to inform people about various diseases, health schemes and general health and hygiene matters.

3,Sena leader seeks tough law against eve-teasing,"MUMBAI: Getting nudged at CST station, being elbowed in a crowded BEST bus and being assailed by hawkers who are quick with double entendres like â€œbhaari maalâ€™â€™ is something most women in Mumbai have experienced. Alarmed by the increasing incidence of eve-teasing, a Shiv Sena legislator from Mazgaon, Bala Nandgaonkar, has proposed new legislation to bring roadside romeos to book.

The non-official bill to make eve-teasing a non-bailable offence is likely to be taken up during the current session of the Maharashtra legislative assembly. At present, eveteasing is a bailable offence under section 354 of the IPC. The Mumbai police has registered 61 cases of molestation of women since January. It has also registered eight cases of eve-teasing in the first three months of the year, up from seven cases recorded all of last year.

But any Mumbaikar who has been at the receiving end of â€˜sweety, sweetyâ€™ knows that these statistics donâ€™t reflect the pinch-andprobe reality. â€œMost women do not take the trouble of complaining to the police because of the hassles involved. Also, they are unable to catch the offenders and march them to the nearest police station,â€™â€™ said Priya Chauhan, a Sion resident who commutes daily by train to her office in south Mumbai. Nandgaonkar said that the existing laws against eveteasing are grossly inadequate. â€œAlso,â€™â€™ he maintained, â€œthe police is not sensitised to the problem of eveteasing.â€™â€™ But a police inspector countered,â€�Unless the victims lodge a complaint with us we cannot take action against the culprits.

We do keep watch of crowded areas like markets, railway stations etc. But we will be able to curb the menace only if complaints are lodged.â€™â€™ Nandgaonkar said that if such offences are made nonbailable, it would instil fear in â€œthose men who think women are objects of lustâ€™â€™. He has also demanded separate courts to handle such cases, as the victim cannot be expected to wait interminably to get justice. Chairperson of the State Womenâ€™s Commission Nirmala Samant-Prabhavalkar agreed with Nandgaonkar. â€œSerious eve-teasing, like making indecent propositions or lewd gestures, should be made non-bailable offences,â€™â€™ she said. â€œBut also, it is equally important that the police should be really prompt in their probe.â€™â€™

However, Prabhavalkar noted that very few women register complaints because they know that the police do not take the offences seriously. This is confirmed by a police officer who admitted, â€œIf we find that the culprit comes from a good family and has made a mistake because of bad company, we call his parents and warn him in their presence. Often the victims withdraw their complaints after the offenders apologise.â€™â€™ Prabhavalkar, who is an advocate, said that it is very easy to curb the problem provided the police is serious. â€œFor example, the police can recommend that the BMC cancel the licence of a hawker if he is found to be eveteasing,â€™â€™ she observed.

4,Many injured in clash near Patna Junction,"PATNA: More than a dozen persons were injured in violent clashes between rickshawpullers and autorickshaw drivers near the Patna Junction on Saturday.

A rickshawpuller offered to take him to the place but demanded Rs 50. â€œWhile talk between them was going on, an autorickshaw driver intervened and offered to take the person to the place demanding only Rs 20,â€� said a GRP officer.

Angry over their colleagueâ€™s failure to strike a deal with the passenger, rickshawpullers attacked autorickshaw drivers present near the Patna Junction. Both the groups pelted each other with brickbats. According to an unconfirmed report, some miscreants also opened fire. Trouble again took place around on Saturday morning when a group of autorickshaw drivers caught a rickshawpuller, Megh Nath Mahto, and set his vehicle on fire. They also beat several rickshawpullers. The autorickshaw drivers went on damaging the tyres of rickshaws at different places in protest against the attack.
