1,Live-band hotels thrive at govt's cost,"bangalore: of the city's 20 live-band restaurants, at least five don't have a licence from the excise department to sell liquor. yet, they go ahead and serve liquor to customers, thus cheating the government. both police and excise department officials blame each other for this, say live-band industry sources. ``in ashoknagar police limits alone, there are three such restaurants. cases have been booked against them, but the show continues.'' another live-band restaurant on brigade road has licence to sell liquor only in a specified portion of the building. ``the schedule mentioned in the licence says liquor has to be sold in the first floor of the building. but the owner sells liquor in other floors of the building too. the police are aware of it, but nothing has been done,'' the sources added. needless to say, the government's loss is a gain for live-band owners and some officials of the police and excise departments.

10,JD (S) criticises Cong rally plan,"bangalore: janata dal (secular) on monday criticised the congress for attempting to display their strength rather than trying to respond to the problems of farmers by organising a mammoth rally in channapatna. speaking to reporters, legislative council opposition leader k.h. srinivas said: ``we never doubted the congress party's strength as that was not the point of contention. we challenged the government to hold a rally in channapatna but they are doing it when it is no longer of any use.'' srinivas was referring to the rally organised by the congress party in channapatna on november 12, in response to his earlier challenge to do the same if they had `guts.' ``they have themselves indicated that they would ferry farmers from all over the state to the rally. but that is a case of misplaced priorities. we wanted them to respond to the plight of farmers in that area after the police firing and subsequent events,'' he explained. srinivas termed the rally an exercise in futility and said he was apprehensive that the situation might worsen after the rally since the farmers would see through the gimmickry of the congress.

12,"Week to go, hardly any signs of electioneering","new delhi: jawaharlal nehru university is living up to its image of being an island in itself. with student elections just a week away, the campus bears no sign of electioneering. while that might sound strange or even unbelievable to some, that's the way elections have always been fought here. and this year is no exception. the credit for this goes not to the authorities, but to the students themselves. an election committee, a powerful body comprising students, oversees the poll process. the eight schools in jnu propose names of students for membership of the committee, who then choose a chairperson. this year, a 27-member committee was set up on october 21. the election committee releases codes of conduct that are strictly adhered to by both the contestants and the parties. ""political organisations have to take the election committee's permission at least 24 hours before taking out a procession and each party can take out a maximum of three processions. specific places have been designated for pasting posters. pasting them outside the allotted space invites disciplinary action,"" election committee chairperson ali raza moosvi said. any doubts about the efficacy of the election committee were dispelled by bhaskan katamnani, an m.phil student in political geography. ""at the moment, the election committee is more powerful than the vice-chancellor,"" he said. and not without reason. ""the election committee can disqualify a candidate and disfranchise a voter who violates rules,"" moosvi said. ""this year, show-cause notices have already been served to three independent candidates and one party.""
