0,No proposal from Centre for ministerial berth: Omar,"NEW DELHI: National Conference has not got any specific proposal from the NDA government at the Centre about having a ministerial representative in the Union Cabinet, party chief and former minister Omar Abdullah said.

Omar said, ""no formal proposal has come to us whether they want to induct the former chief minister and party''s chief patron Farooq Abdullah in the government.""

Although a decision to this effect would be taken by the Working Committee of the National Conference, Omar said, ""I doubt very much whether we will have a ministerial representative.""

The 32-year-old NC leader said that the Centre would have to provide Farooq Abdullah with a post commensurate with his experience and stature.

To a question about the suspension of the passport of Hurriyat Conference leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, Omar said, ""the state and the Centre should work in tandem with each other and leave the flip-flop-flip stand.

""If a passport has been issued then one should be allowed to travel,"" Omar said and added, ""we will be naive if we do not admit the fact that amalgam leaders have been indulging in India bashing whenever they travelled abroad on the passports issued by the country.""

1,Omar accuses Mufti govt of 'witch-hunting',"NEW DELHI: Accusing Mufti Sayeed government of indulging in ""witch-hunting"", National Conference President Omar Abdullah on Sunday disclosed that PDP office bearers had shot off letters to his party leaders to join them and the present migration was a result of a ""fear-psychosis"" created by the present regime.

Breaking his silence on the recent desertion by some National Conference leaders including some former ministers, Omar said that the PDP leaders had written letters to his party cadres asking them to join the ruling party.

""In cases, where the NC leader joined, well and good, otherwise the next letter was shot to security agencies for withdrawal of personal security or bullet proof vehicles,"" Omar said.

He said in several cases, some of his senior leaders, who had not complied with the diktats of Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed or his daughter, received a letter from the police that their security was being withdrawn.

""Mufti government is creating a fear psychosis in the state and is virtually indulging in witch hunting and thriving purely on the basis of breaking other political parties,"" he said.

Three ministers of the erstwhile Cabinet including Nissar Ali, Mohammed Sharief Tariq and an unsuccessful MLA Saddiq Ali joined PDP last week.

""Only in one case I was shocked while in others, our party had rejected them by not giving them renomination,"" he said without elaborating.

Flaying the claims of the state the government on providing accountability, Omar said that induction of a former NC minister, who had not been given nomination because of several allegations of corruption, had ""shown the real face of Mufti government that it is only into politics and not for providing any healing touch.""

Stating that the trend was dangerous, Omar said that he would be holding consultations with his party''s senior colleagues to highlight the witch-hunting of Mufti government.

To a question about the healing touch provided by the present state government, Omar said, ""let us name even one case where Mufti Sayeed government had formulated a healing touch policy.""

""If one wants to comment on providing jobs to various militancy-affected families, the record needs to be set straight. It was the hardwork of the previous government, when the records were compiled and orders were issued, the Election Commission ordered polls and we had to sit back and keep quite,"" he said.

He alleged the Mufti government was neglecting the Kashmir Valley at the cost of Ladakh region. ""We believe that all regions should get there due share, but we find that the Valley is getting a step-motherly treatment,"" he said.

The National Conference president said even the issue of disbanding Special Operation Group (SOG), the main poll plank of the PDP, fell apart and they had to toe the ""line of our party, which suggested the reorientation of the group.""

He said some changes in the office bearers of the party were in the offing but added that ""everything will be done after consultations with senior party leaders.""

2,Hurriyat justifies insistence on Pak inclusion for talks,"NEW DELHI: Asserting that it was guided by ""realities"" and not ""conditionalities"" while seeking a resolution to the Kashmir issue, Hurriyat Conference on sunday said involvement of Pakistan in the dispute was ""not a condition but a principle"" which New Delhi would have to accept.

""Involvement of Pakistan in talks is not a beaten track. This is not condition and Hurriyat does not believe to be guided by conditionalities. We choose to be guided by realities. The participation of Islamabad is a principle after which the talks can proceed,"" Hurriyat Conference Chairman Abdul Gani Bhat said here.

""Whom we should talk to first is a matter of detail. If the principle is accepted, we may talk to India and then go to Pakistan,"" he said.

When asked to comment on the statement of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani that Hurriyat was a spokesperson of Pakistan, Bhat said: ""I do not deny Advani the right to choose his words likewise I hope he will not deny me the right to choose my words.""

""We speak the language of former Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru who had stated that the people of Jammu and Kashmir were the masters of their destiny..."" Bhat said.

Commenting on the suspension of passport of former Hurriyat Chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and whether it could be an impediment in bringing the amalgam to table, Bhat said: ""People in politics have to suffer hiccups of different dimensions at different times and there is no escape from this either.""

3,Harilela Group plans $60-mn investment in India,"NEW DELHI: Optimistic of Indian hotel industry turning around with the government''s proposed open sky policy, Hong Kong-based two billion dollar Harilela Group on Sunday said it was open to invest up to $60 million.

""We are happy to hear Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani announcing at Pravasi Divas meet that Government will soon decide on the open sky policy allowing more flights to come and operate in India. It is a silver-lining for NRIs planning to enter Indian hotel business,"" Hari N Harilela, Chairman of Harilela Group, said.

Harilela said that teams of experts from his group had earlier scouted India to take part in disinvestment in ITDC and IHC hotel properties, but decided against it, although he did not elaborate.

A green field hotel project could be a viable investment option on the back of an open sky policy, that could increase global tourist and business traffic to India, he said.

He, however, expressed great concern over red tapism and rising corruption in the Indian system which, he said, was one of the main causes for NRIs to stay away from investing in the country.

On his proposed investment plans, Harilela said ""our team is already working on the proposed project in India... we would like to enter only main cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai... if the project materialises we will construct minimum 350 room-hotel in 4-star category.""
