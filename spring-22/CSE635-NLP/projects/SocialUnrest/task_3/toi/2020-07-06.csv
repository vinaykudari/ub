1,Low pressure weakens over Bay; city records 7 cm rainfall,"HYDERABAD/VISAKHAPATNAM: The low pressure area over west central Bay of Bengal has weakened and moved away from coastal Andhra.

The Cyclone Warning Centre (CWC) said on Sunday that since it was a shallow system it had weakened and moved away from the coast. There were reports of isolated rainfall in north coastal Andhra on Sunday.

However, associated cyclonic circulation extending up to midtropospheric levels tilting southwestwards now lies over north coastal Andhra Pradesh and adjoining areas.

Rain or thundershowers are likely to occur at many places over coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and at a few places over Rayalaseema during the next 48 hours.

Reports of heavy rainfall came in from Warangal and Eturnagaram, both recording 8 cm while Hyderabad airport and Dundigal recorded 7 cm on Sunday. Nearly 5 cm rainfall was recorded in Perur and Yellandu in Khammam and Suryapet in Nalgonda, while Bhongir in Nalgonda recorded 4 cm.

2,Punjab minister Harbans Lal sacked,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief Amarinder Singh removed minister of state for forests Harbans Lal from his council of ministers on Sunday following his indictment in an inquiry for colluding with private contractors in illegal tree-felling in Ropar district. He has sent a letter to Punjab governor OP Verma urging him to remove Harbans Lal.

Amarinder has referred the report to the Vigilance Bureau (VB) to look into the role of each of the indicted. Commissioner Ferozepur division Dharmvir has also been put under suspension for offering concessions to contractors during his tenure as special secretary (forests).

The sacking would blunt the criticism that Amarinder has been soft on probing charges of corruption against Congressmen. It would also send a signal to his cabinet colleagues that he would not hesitate in sacrificing any of them in his crusade against corruption. Besides, It would boost his moral authority to take action against bureaucrats, who used to gang up whenever the VB moved against a senior IAS officer.

In the departmental inquiry conducted by secretary (forests) P Ram, Harbans Lal was accused of colluding with contractors and allowing them to fell over 15,000 Khair and other trees in private forests in Ropar district. He also helped the contractors, Lachhman Singh and Bhagat Singh, by extending their contract period.

Harbans Lal, along with another minister, Ramesh Dutt, had been earlier indicted for carrying on private practice on the basis of fake Ayurvedic degrees.

3,Teachers' association blasts education minister,"LUCKNOW: Launching a scathing attack on the higher education minister and the higher education directorate, Federation of UP University College Teachers'' Association (Fupucta) on Sunday demanded a CBI inquiry into the alleged cases in which hundreds of colleges had been given ''no-objection-certificates'' (NOCs) for starting/running self-finance courses without even meeting the necessary pre-conditions and norms prescribed by the University Grant Commission and state universities.

Addressing mediapersons after a meeting of Fupucta representatives from all over the state, Fupucta president Ghanshayam Singh and general secretary Prof LN Pandey said that the time had come that university/college teachers launched a ''direct action'' against the corruption prevailing in the higher education field. While there were 345 aided degree colleges and 110 government degree colleges in the state, there were 600 degree colleges which had been given NOCs to run under self-finance category, he said adding that out of which 80 per cent of colleges did not fulfil the necessary norms.

Fupucta leaders even went on to allege that the proposals, which were initially not found fit for running self-finance courses, were later, however, given green signals by ''higher-ups'' for the reasons known better to them. They said that these college lacked in infrastructure and faculty, did not have proper pay scales for teachers, some of them were not even registered as societies, but all had been allowed to run under self-finance category.

""Retired teachers were forced to run from pillar to post for their superannuation benefits by senior officers in the directorate,"" said Molindu Mishra, president Lucknow University Associated College Teachers'' Association. Fuputca members also slammed higher education minister for not implementing the promises made to Fupucta leaders during talks in January and April this year. The minister had agreed on increasing the retirement age of teachers from 60 to 62, gratuity on retirement at the age of 60 and opening of pension option, among other demands.

The teachers of minority institutions still have to get ''double approval'' of their appointment, one from the higher education commission and other from the vice-chancellor of the university, despite the fact that a Supreme Court order says that there should be only one approval. A proposal in this regard had been awaiting cabinet approval for the last six months, they said. Teachers will take mass casual leave on August 5 in support of their demands and observe Teacher''s Day (September 5) as ''black day'' besides holding series of agitations all over the state.

4,Advani rebuffs Mamata on Central rule,"KOLKATA: The Trinamul Congress may cry itself hoarse but there will be no Central intervention and no imposition of Presidentâ€™s Rule, not even Article 355, deputy Prime Minister LK Advani announced here on Sunday.

The entire Trinamul top brigade led by Mamata Banerjee pleaded with and cajoled Advani at the party office trying to explain that democracy was at stake in West Bengal and Central intervention was obligatory for the Union government.

An unmoved Advani, however, shook his head and bluntly told the gathering of Trinamul MPs, MLAs and councillors that instead of demanding Presidentâ€™s Rule, they should rather go to the people, create a level playing for themselves vis-a-vis the CPM and only then try to remove the Marxists from power.

â€œThe Centre canâ€™t create that level playing field for you here. Only the political parties and the people have that power. There are states where we never even dreamt of winning elections. But we went to the people and convinced them. We won in these states not because we are in power at the Centre but because the people rejected the earlier regime and voted for us,â€� Advani told the shocked and baffled Trinamul leaders.

â€œThe CPM lost even an old bastion like Kanpur only because the people wanted so,â€� he reminded them again.

With a parental pat in the back, Advani, however, also attempted to pep them up. â€œEarlier it was thought the Marxists can never be removed from power in this state. That idea changed after Trinamul was born. The BJP will strengthen its bond with Trinamul and fight the Marxists together.â€�

The Trinamul Congress had done elaborate homework to please and convince the deputy PM that Central intervention in West Bengal was an obvious necessity. Mamata had even invited Sudip Bandyopadhyay to a party meeting on Saturday night to help convince Advani.

On the way to Trinamul Bhavan, both sides of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass were decorated with loud posters that applauded Advani and condemned the CPM for killing democracy in the state. Speakers were lined up to rub into Advani that the Centre must rescue the democratic rights of the people.

â€œThere is a constitutional crisis here,â€� said mayor Subrata Mukherjee. â€œAs many as 472 Trinamul activists have been killed in the last four years and 10,000 rendered homeless,â€� said Pankaj Banerjee. â€œWe demand Presidentâ€™s Rule. You at least give us Article 355,â€� pleaded Mamata.

State BJP president Tathagata Ray, who had earlier met Advani and was aware of his mood, however, never demanded Central intervention in any form. Rather he insisted upon a stronger bond between the Trinamul and the BJP. Mamata, however, attempted to maintain a brave face. â€œI am happy with Advanijiâ€™s visit. We have explained our situation,â€� she told reporters after seeing him off at the airport. She had no idea that every word discussed during her closed door meeting with Advani was audible to the reporters, thanks to the microphones placed outside.

5,1-metre ballot paper in council polls,"PATNA: As many as 1,010 candidates are left in the fray for the 24 legislative council seats from the local bodiesâ€™ constituencies, the election for which is scheduled to be held on July 10.

According to reports reaching the office of the chief electoral officer here on Monday after withdrawal of names, the highest number of candidates â€” 72 â€” is in fray in Samastipur seat.

West Champaran is at the bottom with only 22 candidates in the field. Among other constituencies, Madhubani has 60 candidates, Vaishali 57, Rohtas-Kaimur and Gaya-Jehanabad-Arwal 55 each, Patna 54, Bhagalpur-Banka 52, Nalanda and Saharsa-Madhepura-Supaul 50 each, Darbhanga 48, Sitamarhi-Sheohar and Munger-Jamui-Lakhisarai-Sheikhpura 46 each, Saran 44, Katihar 41, Muzaffarpur 39, Bhojpur-Buxer 38, East Champaran 31, Begusarai-Khagaria 29, Aurangabad 26, Gopalganj 25, Purnia-Araria-Kishanganj 24, and Nawada and Siwan 23 each.

Meanwhile, the officers and employees in the office of the CEO are busy sorting out the issue of size of ballot papers, particularly of Samastipur and Madhubani constituencies.

As per the Election Commissionâ€™s directive, for each candidate a space of 5/8 inch should be allotted on a ballot paper, if the number of candidates in a constituency is eight or more.

If the instruction of the EC is followed, the size of the ballot papers of Samastipur and Madhubani constituencies will be more than one metre as per the rough calculation made by the officials in the CEO office, said CEO N S Madhavan. Folding of such a long ballot paper and inserting it through a narrow gap in a ballot-box will not be easy even for government officials engaged in election work.

Thus, the problem to be faced by voters, most of whom will be from rural areas, can easily be imagined.

About 1.38 lakh voters, including about 43,000 women, will cast their votes at 538 polling stations. In Patna, as many as 5,546 voters, including 1,841 women, will exercise their franchise at 26 polling stations.

6,Comprehensive Rly plan for development in Bihar: Rana,"DANAPUR: Former chairman of the Railway Board I I M S Rana said the board has prepared a comprehensive plan for the all-round development of railway network in Bihar to fulfil the needs of the people.

Talking to TNN on phone, Rana said Bihar remained neglected for more than 30 years so far as the development of railway network was concerned. However, a number of projects were sanctioned for the state in the last two to three years to galvanise the development of railway network in the state, he added.

Construction of three mega bridges, electrification and doubling of the Patna-Gaya line, creation of a railway zone with its headquarters at Hajipur and modernisation of the Patna junction were some of the schemes launched by the Railway Board to make Bihar figure prominently on the railway map of the country, Rana said, adding that a huge amount of money has been spent on the railway safety work, particularly in Bihar.

Describing his tenure as chairman of the Railway Board as ""most challenging and fruitful"", Rana maintained that out of 200 proposals for new development projects, the board approved about 160 proposals all over the country. He admitted that there is still a lot to be done on the safety front. Acting on a report based on the two-year intensive research work, the railways have now decided to focus on the work relating to safety, security and punctuality, he said.

He lauded the efforts made by railway minister Nitish Kumar for accelerating the pace of development of railway network in Bihar.

7,Will live-ins be allowed to live within the law?,"MUMBAI: Indian law could soon take a tentative step towards meeting couples who have never looked for an â€˜ever afterâ€™ clause in indelible ink written into their closest relationships.

These are couples who believe that no ink can really be indelible and prefer to live in, giving that paperwork called marriage a miss.

The Justice V.S Malimath Committee recommendation to the Law Commission this year states that if a woman has been in a live-in relationship for a â€˜reasonableâ€™ period, she should enjoy the legal rights of the wife. If this recommendation is accepted, the term â€˜wifeâ€™ may be redefined in the Indian Penal Code.

Itâ€™s interesting that many women who are living in today are not overly excited by the recommendation. â€œI donâ€™t give much importance to the word â€˜wifeâ€™. And going by the way marriages fare today, nor does society,â€™â€™ said television actress Jaya Bhattacharya, who has been living with director Mazahar Rahim for four years.

â€œSo whatâ€™s the big deal in joining this bandwagon? Besides, if Iâ€™ve deliberately chosen to live in rather than marry, itâ€™s because I donâ€™t believe in the â€˜legalâ€™ aspect of either rights or obligations.â€™â€™

Even those who agree that the idea is, if nothing else, a step forward in social thinking, feel that it isnâ€™t a big enough stride. â€œOur law is always behind the times,â€™â€™ said Bishakha Datta, who runs a womenâ€™s NGO â€˜Point of Viewâ€™ and who is in a long-term live-in relationship.

â€œIt thinks of taking one step forward once in a century and so always misses the point. For instance, today same-sex relationships are an open, social reality. Yet this recommendation takes only heterosexual live-in relationships into account. Rather than redefining â€˜wifeâ€™ or â€˜husbandâ€™, perhaps they need to replace these terms altogether, with â€˜partnerâ€™.â€™â€™

Just the fact that an article like this on live-in relationships has only one â€˜name changed on requestâ€™, shows that Ms Datta is, perhaps, right about the growing acceptance of such social realities.

â€œLive-in relationships have existed for ages, itâ€™s not a new phenomenon,â€™â€™ said Shalini Bharat, head of the Family Studies Unit at the Tata Institute of Social Science. â€œOnly, the stigma has now been removed from it in certain sections of society, sometimes to an extent where itâ€™s politically incorrect to ask a couple whether theyâ€™re married or not.â€™â€™

If you do ask, the answer is often honest. â€œI want to earn lots of money, want to remain independent and donâ€™t want to have children, so why should I get married?â€™â€™ asked Ms Bhattacharya. â€œYet, since both Rahim and have hectic working schedules, itâ€™s convenient for us to live together.â€�

As actress Achint Kaur, who moved in with colleague Mohan Kapoor, said, â€œOur living together is more a practical issue. At one point, when we were dating each other, both of us were looking for apartments. Thatâ€™s when we realised that if we shared an apartment, we could spend more time together.â€™â€™

8,Technique 'increases' forests,"MUMBAI: At first glance, the news about Maharashtraâ€™s forest cover is cheering. The forest survey of Indiaâ€™s latest report shows that forest cover in the state increased by almost a thousand sq km between 1999 and 2001, from 46,672 sq km to 47,482.

Significantly, most of this increase has been in dense forest cover, which is defined as wooded area with over 40 per cent canopy density, rather than open, or sparse, forest cover.

But the reportâ€™s fine print shows that the news is probably too good to be true. This is because the recent survey has used different, more sophisticated techniques of interpretation, which makes it difficult to compare the new data with that of previous years. Moreover, additional areas, which were excluded from the older surveys, have also been included.

â€œSo any apparent increase or decrease has little meaning,â€� explains an environmentalist. As the report itself states, â€œThe difference between forest cover is not entirely due to changes in the ground but includes differences due to technical factors.â€�

It suggests that the new data gives a more accurate picture about forest cover which can be used as a baseline for future reference.

Curiously, although the caveat about technical difference is reiterated throughout the report, it has been conveniently left out of the official fanfare over the country-wide increase in forest cover. Indiaâ€™s forest cover is up by six per cent, according to the survey.

What are the technical differences which could account for the change? The Floor Space Index (FSI) has been using satellite data to assess forest cover for decades now but this time, they interpreted data digitally, rather than visually.

The scale is higher â€” 1: 50,000 rather than 1: 250,000 â€” which means the FSI can discern forest lands down to one hectare, as opposed to 25 hectares. So small patches of forest, which were previously invisible are included.

Similarly, the survey shows an increase in mangrove cover in the state, from 108 sq km in 1999 to 118 sq km in 2001, but this is still less than the 97 figure of 124 sq km.

9,Consumer court rules in favour of Sony TV customer,"PUNE: In an important judgement, the Pune additional district consumer disputes redressal forum has directed Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Sony India Pvt Ltd, New Delhi and Mumbai, and citybased Empire Music House to pay Rs 25,000 as compensation to a customer for deficient service.

In his complaint, Devkaran Shah, a resident of Gen. Thimmayya road, said he had purchased a Sony colour TV (Model No 2167) from the Empire Music House for Rs 25,000 in 1996.

Within a fortnight, the sound quality was found to be poor. When contacted, the dealer replaced the set with another one (Model No. 2197). The dealer demanded Rs 550 from Shah towards octroi. When Shah asked why a different model was being supplied, the dealer said the company had discontinued Model No 2167.

However, Shah made a few enquiries and discovered that the model was very much on the stands and that the replacement was cheaper by Rs 2,000.

The complainant contacted Sony India Pvt Ltd, New Delhi, which confirmed that the model had not been discontinued and that octroi was not payable in his case.

The company also assured Shah in writing that he should get a refund of Rs 2,450 from the dealer.

When Shah approached the dealer again, the latter said he could not refund the money unless the company ordered him to. Shah then wrote to Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan by fax. When his letter was ignored, Shah approached the consumer court, demanding compensation for mental agony.

When the matter came up for hearing, the company claimed the matter should be sorted out at a local level since it was a dispute between the dealer and the consumer.

The dealer in an affidavit claimed the complaint was false and he was justified in demanding octroi.

Ruling in Shahâ€™s favour, additional district consumer forum president Sandhya Kulkarni and member Anjali Karadkhedkar held both the company and the dealer guilty of deficient service and observed that it was obligatory for Sony Corp. and Sony India to assist the complainant.

The compensation includes the refund of Rs 2,450, Rs 1,000 towards the cost of filing the case and a provision for charging 12 per cent interest in case of delay in compensation beyond eight weeks.

10,Rubber import not Centre's policy: Thomas,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Centre was not in favour of allowing import of rubber, Union Minister of State for Law P C Thomas said on Sunday.

Addressing a press conference here, Thomas said a recent Supreme Court order quashing the direction of Director General of Foreign trade (DGFT) cancelling the permit for rubber import under advance licence system had created doubts in the minds of rubber growers.

Supreme court quashed the DGFT order on some technical ground, he said.

Thomas said the order was not in favour of the Centre''s rubber policy and its stand was that rubber import would not be allowed.

He said he had talked to Union Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley and appealed to him not to sanction rubber import at any cost. Jaitley conveyed that the Centre had no plans to allow rubber import, Thomas said.

Referring to the setting up of fast track courts in the country, he said the Centre was contemplating setting up fast track magistrate courts in the country. Discussions in this regard was progressing, he said.

11,A saga of incompetence and insensitivity,"BANGALORE: Had a private eatery served harmful food to its customers, it would have, in all probability, faced stern legal action. There are in fact laws under which it could have been booked and its licence revoked.

But although the same laws apply to government-run food outlets and food schemes, it is unlikely that it will come to any harm, despite the magnitude of the mid-day meal tragedy. In our political landscape, governments operate in a legal space all their own. Their writ is supreme and their licence sacrosanct. They have an unquestionable licence to do what they please and, on most occasions, the power to get away with it.

Over just a few days, 600-plus children have been laid low by food served to them under the much-hyped free lunch scheme. Despite mounting evidence that the meals dished out to the unsuspecting children were of poor quality, and that alone was irrefutably responsible for their suffering, the government has decided to brazen it out and to continue with the scheme.

Almost as an afterthought, and after much prompting from the media, it has announced some steps to ensure that there is no repeat of what has happened. How these steps will be enforced, no one knows.

The government is averse to suspending the scheme (even temporarily), probably because it is fearful of the political fallout of such a move. And it has said nothing about compensating the young victims for their torment, arguably because that would mean admission of guilt. Neither of this is a palatable prospect for the government in an election year.

This is not the first time that politicians have sacrificed public good at the altar of politics. It will not be the last time either.

The first reactions of the government were stunning. These occurrences â€œare common, just some teething troubleâ€™â€™, said the chief minister. The first â€œ15 days are meant to be a trial periodâ€™â€™, said a senior officer dispassionately. One wonders whether our leaders would have been so dispassionatehad their children, God forbid, been among those who had partaken of the meals. Will they conduct dietary trials on their children?

Just for an idea of how seriously the issue is being taken, one teacher in an affected school glibly said the children had fallen sick because they had overeaten. Her statement went unchallenged. Medical experts are unanimous that overeating can never be the cause of dysentery and vomiting. The most obvious reason is food poisoning.

Now, true to best political traditions, a conspiracy theory is being propounded, in an effort, one imagines, to camouflage the mess. Even if one were to subscribe to the theory that this was indeed an act of political sabotage, the government can still neither escape from the blame nor from its responsibility, just as an airline company cannot avoid paying hefty compensations in the event of a crash, regardless of the cause.

The question is: how and why did the government launch the scheme without ensuring that stringent quality checks were in place? And now that the damage has been done, why is it not coming clean and compensating the affected? Why, indeed, is it not suspending the scheme (at least in the affected regions) until it has got its act together? The people of Karnataka deserve answers to these questions.

13,SP to go alone in Assembly polls,"NEW DELHI: Putting pressure on the Congress to agree to an alliance, the Samajwadi Party has decided to go it alone in the coming assembly elections despite the possibility of splitting the non-BJP vote.

At national executive meeting here on Monday, the Samajwadi leaders agreed to field candidates for the majority of seats in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Delhi to ""gain the stature of a national party"".

Accusing the Congress of failing to take follow-up action on its Srinagar declaration to work for a broad anti-BJP coalition, the SP said it should not be blamed if such an alliance did not materialise.

Holding the Congress responsible for the defeat of its candidate against the BSP-BJP alliance in the Chiraigaon assembly byelection near Varanasi, SP general secretary Amar Singh told reporters that but for the Congress presence, his party would have won the seat.

""If honourable terms of cooperation are offered, we are ready to respond in the war of secularism,"" he said.

He pointed out that SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had taken the first initiative for a united campaign against the BJP-BSP combine in Uttar Pradesh.

""We reduced the BJP to the third position in UP and we are determined to do that in other states as well,"" he said. He was hopeful that in the Lok Sabha elections next year, the ruling NDA would be ""wiped out"".

The SP, he said, was willing to a ""give and take"" if there was a proper gesture from another secular party.

Referring to the government''s China policy, Singh said it was difficult to reconcile Prime Minister Vajpayee''s new bonhomie with defence minister George Fernandes'' strong pro-Tibet position.

While favouring negotiations as an instrument for resolving the Ayodhya dispute, he said: ""An impression has gained ground that the government has deliberately made the talks fail."" The consequences of the failed talks for the nation, he warned, would be serious.

""It is unfortunate that the Shankaracharya''s formula was tantamount to asking the Muslims to hand over the Ayodhya site where the Masjid (had) stood, for building a temple,"" the party said.

The episode once again highlights the necessity to get a judicial verdict to settle the dispute, it said.

15,"TADA court modifies charge against Sanjay, 115 others","MUMBAI: A special court on Monday modified the charge of conspiracy framed against 116 bomb blast accused, including film actor Sanjay Dutt, and recorded their plea.

The charge of conspiracy was modified to include the name of co-accused Majnu Mustaffa, brother of prime accused Mohammed Dossa, in the 1993 bomb blast conspiracy.

The exercise was undertaken as Majnu was deported from Dubai recently.

Eighty-two accused on bail and 34 in custody pleaded not guilty to the modified charge.

In a related development, the court deferred till June nine framing of charges against Majnu as his lawyer Rizwan Merchant pleaded for time to challenge the order of the designated court in the supreme court.

Meanwhile, the court modified the common charge of conspiracy to include Majnu''s name as his involvement figured in a statement of co-accused Salim Mira Shaikh.

In response to summons issued by the court, 82 accused on bail, including Sanjay, on Monday appeared before designated judge PD Kode to submit their plea on modification of charges.

Thirty-four accused in custody were also produced before the court.

In a related development, Sanjay and other accused on bail were exempted from appearance till July 21.

16,J&K govt wants only registered pilgrims for Amarnath,"NEW DELHI: Even as more and more pilgrims are arriving in Jammu and Kashmir to take part in the annual Amarnath yatra, which begins on Wednesday, state government officials in charge of the arrangements are concerned about their security as well as any law and order problem.

A senior government official said: ""We would like only registered pilgrims to go to Amarnath. It makes it easier to manage, keep a check on the security and the numbers.""

In fact, four people were injured when unregistered pilgrims, mostly sadhus, and the Jammu police clashed on Monday. The police resorted to a lathicharge on a group of protestors who staged a demonstration at the Tawi bridge.

Around 300 people, mostly sadhus, assembled at the Tawi bridge around noon and blocked traffic, raising slogans against the state government for its decision to close registration of pilgrims for the Yatra on July 1 itself, sources here said.

Home ministry officials said all arrangements had been made for the yatra and the requisite number of para-military forces had been deployed. However, the role of the Centre is limited to sending the forces since law and order is a state government subject.

The annual Amarnath Yatra in terrorism-hit J&K gets underway on Wednesday. The Central Reserve Police Force has made elaborate security arrangements for the pilgrims trekking to the cave shrine, a home ministry official said.

He said the CRPF has deployed 36 companies for the security of people taking part in the yatra which has witnessed terrorist attacks at least twice earlier.

At least 26 CRPF companies have been deployed on the 42-km yatra route in the Kashmir valley while the rest have been positioned at Jammu, the official said.

The CRPF already has 276 companies deployed in the state -- 199 in the Kashmir valley and 77 in Jammu -- performing various duties, including providing security to VIPs, vital installations and ensuring free flow of traffic besides escort duty, counter-insurgency operations and maintenance of law and order.

18,180 houses allotted to riot-affected,"AHMEDABAD: One hundred and eight houses built by the Gujarat Sarjanik Welfare Trust, near Amber Tower on the Sarkhej Road, were allotted to the riot-affected people at a ceremony on Sunday.

The chairman of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) Surendra Patel, who was the chief guest, inaugurated the 180-house complex â€˜Siddiquabadâ€™. The houses were allotted to the beneficiaries through a draw, in which each beneficiary was asked to pick up a chit bearing the number of the house.

The function was attended by the general secretary of Jamiat-e-ulema-e-Hind Maulana Mehmood Asad, Maulana Ghulam Mohammed Vastanvi and National Congress leader and former MP Tariq Anwar. AUDA chairman Surendra Patel, in his address, called upon the beneficiaries to live in harmony.

Maulana Madni and Maulana Vastanvi emphasised on the need for education and said that the community needs to devote more time and energy towards achieving this goal.

Secretary of the trust Afzal Memon said the trust, which was formed for the earthquake-affected people of Kutch, has extended its services in the city and other parts of Gujarat for the rehabilitation of the riot-affected people.

19,Congress panel wins Baroda Dairy polls,"VADODARA: The panel fielded by the BJP for the prestigious Baroda Dairy elections in the city had to face rout. The Congress-sponsored panel bagged 10 of the 15 seats in the elections, held on Saturday, results for which were declared late on Sunday.

The Sahakar panel, sponsored by the Congress,was being led by Narendra Patel â€˜Mukhiâ€™ who is the current chairman of the dairy. The BJP had fielded the Pragati panel led by Savli MLA Upendrasinh Gohil.

The elections had generated a lot of interest in the rural areas of the district, with party machinery of both BJP and Congress going whole hog to ensure that their candidates win the polls.

The BJP was eyeing a victory in the dairy polls as all the MLAs in the district belonged to the party. However,when the results were declared late on Sunday evening all hopes fell flat with the Pragati panel winning only five seats. Gohil himself, however,won a seat in the elections with a good majority and polled second highest votes in the election.

As many as 887 of 889 members of the dairy cast their votes in the elections. Mukhi polled the highest of 495 votes while Gohil polled 459 votes. Commenting on the win, former Congress MP from Chhota Udepur Naransinh Rathwa said, â€œThe scams in co-operative sector led to the defeat of the BJP in the elections. Problems in sugar mills also added to it.â€�

Rathwa added that hike in electricity rates for farmers also contributed to the BJPâ€™s dismal performance. â€œBesides, we were always strong in the rural area and have a majority in most of the panchayats,â€� he said. BJP leaders in the district said the bad performance was largely due to overconfidence.

â€œWe needed to do some more groundwork. Having won the recent assembly polls with a thumping majority,we seem to have taken the elections a bit lightly,â€� a senior leader said.
