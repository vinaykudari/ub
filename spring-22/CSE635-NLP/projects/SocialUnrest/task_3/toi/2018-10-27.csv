0,Varsity in trouble for not holding polls,"mumbai: the controversial nashik-based maharashtra university of health sciences (muhs) is at the centre of a storm again. and this time for not conducting elections to the various statutory bodies in the university, though a good three years have passed after the varsity was established. the fact that a chosen few were manning varsity statutory authorities such as the senate and the management council had caused much heartburn amongst many in the medical community. many had complained that the teaching community had not been adequately represented in the university bodies and that varsity officials were handpicking a few to take decisions affecting 200-odd institutions and thousands of students. it's an allegation which the varsity has denied vociferously, but the issue surfaced again recently, after governor p.c. alexander - ex-officio chancellor of all universities in the state - directed the varsity to conduct elections to the various statutory bodies within a specified time-period. the directive, issued last week, comes soon after a show-cause notice was issued by the chancellor to varsity vice-chancellor dr d.g. dongaonkar. in the show-cause notice, the chancellor sought an explanation from dr dongaonkar as to why he should not set aside the latter's order providing for the setting up of bodies with nominated members. ""the chancellor's order assumes significance considering the fact that the varsity had not followed the maharashtra health university act, 1998, under which elections were to be conducted to the varsity bodies within six months or a period specified by the government, not exceeding one year,"" said a medical faculty member. the university's reason for not conducting elections was that it was short of staff (only 70-odd employees, with many being on deputation) and that it was tied up with the conduct of the common entrance test for medical exams, among other things. ""considering the staff shortage, i had asked the government to modify the act so that we could continue with nominated members in our statutory bodies for three years, instead of the specified six months,"" dr dongaonkar told this newspaper. however, the chancellor has noted in his letter that even the composition of the ad-hoc mc - for which the vice-chancellor had sought an extension - suffered from various irregularities. for one, while the act specified 14 members, the ad-hoc mc had 21 members. secondly, the vice-chancellor had not included the medical education and drugs department secretary in the mc, thought under the act, the secretary is an ex-officio member. also, ""the vice-chancellor did not approach the chancellor to appoint his nominees as required by the act,"" the letter notes. the vice-chancellor, however, explains the apparent ""deviations"" from the act by stating that he had asked the government for extending the ad-hoc mc and other statutory bodies. the matter finally came up before the chancellor, who in a show-cause notice issued to the v-c in september, asked the varsity for an explanation. after perusing the v-c's explanation, the chancellor has stated that there appeared to be ""no wilful omission"" on the former's part. nevertheless, the chancellor has instructed the varsity to constitute a regular mc in the place of the ad-hoc one ""without any further delay"". the mc has to be constituted as per the act within a period of one month of receiving this order, the chancellor has said. elections are to be conducted to the academic council within three months as well. but is the university geared up to implement the chancellor's directive? ""we have to,"" says a university official, but adds that it is going to be a difficult task with so few staff members. ""the government has sanctioned additional staff, but we have to bear their salary and other expenses. so we cannot even make any new recruitments,"" he adds.

1,Bt cotton an MNC ploy: RSS farmers' wing,"gandhinagar/ahmedabad: the bharatiya kisan sangh, the powerful farmers' wing of the sangh parivar, has cautioned the state government on the bt gene cotton seed controversy following the centre's directive to burn the crop in gujarat even as the bjp's political leadership here is convinced that the genetically-engineered seed is good for farmers. the bks is in no mood to accept the state government's argument that the genetically-engineered seed is harmless or that india's pesticides' lobby is behind the campaign against the new seed. the bks leadership considers the seed an attempt by foreign multinational companies to impose on india farming techniques ``that would make us subservient to the west''. speaking to the times news network here on friday, the outfit`s all-india secretary jivanbhai patel, state treasurer bababhai patel and north gujarat secretary mangalbhai patel said the seed was an attack on swadeshi and was part of the wto strategy to make farmers dependent on foreign seeds. ``we have yet to know the results of the genetically-engineered cotton seed sown by farmers, but the fact is there is a clear attempt to impose on us what are called terminator seeds,'' mangalbhai said. added jivanbhai, ``we are not against foreign technology or seeds. but if the west is seeking to impose on us what are actually impotent seeds, making the farmers approach mncs only to buy them before every season, then we are certainly against it. its environmental impact needs to be examined thoroughly. if the centre wants the crop to be burnt, then one has to see the reasons behind this.'' he said if the crop is burnt, the farmers must be paid full compensation by the company that provided them with the seeds. a bks delegation would meet chief minister narendra modi on sunday to give a memorandum on wto which would also mention the cotton seed controversy. stating that one should not forget the andhra pradesh experience, mangalbhai said: ``failure to get the proper price for a new variety of cotton crop made several cotton farmers commit suicide in that state. one hopes that situation does not arise here.'' state agriculture minister purshottam rupala and union textile minister kashiram gujarat have already reacted sharply against the the centre's directive to burn down the crop sown from the genetically-engineered seed on the ground that the farmers' production costs are down as they did not have to use pesticides. former agriculture minister bhupendrasinh chudasma has also favoured cultivation of genetically-engineered cotton as its quality and yield are far better than the traditional cotton produced in saurashtra and central and south gujarat districts. chudasma said: ``there was nothing wrong in going ahead with cultivation of genetic cotton which has been accepted by several european countries and even countries like china.''

2,Principals asked to increase computer students,"patiala: the punjab government, not getting an encouraging response for the computer education courses being run in government schools, has served the principals an ultimatum: either they arrange for the required number of students or face transfers. punjab joint secretary satwant singh johal, on the other hand, told the times of india that incompetent school principals were unjustified in protesting against the decision. ''the new course has received a good response in many schools,and if the heads of other schools have not been able to motivate the desired number of students towards computer education, there should be no hesitation in taking action against them,he added. under the terms of contract with a private company, secondary schools were to provide 500 students, a big room with the required furniture and a three-phase connection, while the company had to provide 10 computers and three instructors in each school.a monthly fees of rs 80 per month was fixed, and out of the total students, computer education was to be provided up to 25 per cent scheduled caste students at rs 40 per month. out of the total collected fee, a 10 per cent share was to be given to the school concerned. interestingly, the private company was allowed to use the computer room after the school classes for running its own classes. there are around 700 secondary schools in the state out of which only a few have the strength of more than 500.when the authorities sensed the failure of the scheme, they reduced the number of students by 300 against which the company had to provide five computers and one instructor. the number of schools in rural areas having a total strength up to 500 students is not much and till date this scheme has been implemented only in 82 schools. according to educationists, under the present set-up, a student paying rs 80 per month can get only 27 minutes for computer education. the joint secretary (education) said he had directed the schools to spare at least four periods for computer education. a large number of private schools are imparting computer education at only rs 50 per month. most of the students in government schools are from poor families, but committed to run this optional subject at every cost in the schools, the joint secretary said that poor families could easily spare the fees amount and later earn rs 3,000-4,000 per month. moreover, he had already suggested the principals that they should try to get sponsorships for the poor students or pay their fees from their schools' 10 per cent share. a principal said, on condition of anonymity, that this scheme was meant to benefit private companies. under the scheme, every school has to pay about rs 2.5 lakh a year to the private company.with the same amount, the school can purchase at least five good computers and pay salaries to at least two private instructors at rs 2,000 each per month.

3,"RSS chief avoids politics, talks RSS philosophy","nagpur: contrary to expectations in the sangh pariwar that the rss chief would use the opportunity of his viyadashami address to aggressively respond to political developments like growing schism between the pariwar and the bjp or on the ayodhya issue, sarsanghachalak k.s. sudarshan speech was marked by a silence on these very issues. except for a vitriolic attack on the communists whom he described as raitors, the address had a surfeit of rss philosophy. the rss chief traditionally addresses thousands of swyamsevaks in full uniform who perform a combat drill on the vijayadashami morning . the address is considered very significant as it is indicative of the course the hindu monolith would adopt for the year ahead. there was speculation that this year he may delve deep into the growing differences with the bjp-led government or on the ayodhya ram temple. however, but for the symbolically placed cutout of the proposed temple exactly below the rss flag, there was no reference to the temple at the function or in his 80-minute speech on friday. launching a scathing attack on the communists for resisting changes in the education system chalked out the national council for education, research and training (ncert), he said changes in the system were needed badly. what is the point in sticking to the british education policy which was designed to consolidate their grip on its colonies, what is wrong if we draw inspiration from our glorious ancient texts and lay stress of character-building, social values and our unique culture, the rss chief asked defending changes in the education system. after independence, the communists somehow managed to have domination in academic and social research institutions and gave their own skewed interpretation of indian history , he said. `how can these communists explain presence of lenin on page number 12 in class viii textbook in the chapter on modern history of india, mr sudarshan wondered. calling communists raitors who owe allegiance to forces outside the country, he blamed them for diluting references in textbooks to aggression of muslim invaders. referring to the september 11 aftermath, mr sudarshan said : ` today america has declared a war against terrorism. but if we see in retrospect, the bhasmasur (devil) of taliban has been its own creation. in a similar fashion mrs indira gandhi created bhindranwale and mr rajiv gandhi supported the ltte, who in turn turned into their nemesis. if the asuri (evil) forces are encouraged for short-term political gains, disastrous consequences are bound to follow. stressing that india had been raising its voice against terrorism and demanding that pakistan be declared a rouge state, he said these voices fell on deaf years all these years. and now the bigger irony that pakistan has become the front-line state in this us-sponsored global fight against terrorism, the rss chief remarked. `we must understand that we have to fight our own battle. nobody is going to fight it for us. advocating a swadeshi, rural based economy in pave of the western model adopted by india, mr sudarshan blamed it on nehru for repeatedly ignoring mahatma gandhis exhortations on this count. ""india's needs are different, we should not blindly ape the west, there is a need for to invent our own economic model to ensure the vast majority of the rural poor were nor denied their basic needs while the country continued its impressive strides in i-t or space research,"" the rss chief remarked. speaking on the occasion chief guest lt. gen k.k. nanda (retd) called for an urgent need to adopt a pro-active stance against pakistan in curbing cross border terrorism in kashmir. lord rama invaded lanka to destroy ravana but in our 13 years struggle against the menace of terrorism we have failed to kill the devils some of them harboured in pakistan, lamented the 1971 war veteran and head of a non-government defence think-tank. talking to newsmen later, he said, if needed, india should attack terrorist camps in pok but immediately cut supplies to militant outfits within the kashmirvalley. however, when asked for reaction to prime minister vajpayees statement that india was ready for both war and peace with pakistan, mr khanna said chances of a conventional war were not imminent.

4,"No way, says minister","lucknow: while issuing stern warning against coaching by government and aided school teachers in any manner, up higher education minister om prakash singh on thursday said that there was no question of considering their demand for non-coaching allowance like non-practising allowance given to doctors in the state. talking to mediapersons here, the minister said that there was no justification for the demand of non-coaching allowance, as teachers of universities or semi government colleges were prohibited from teaching outside under the law. such an act is against their code of conduct and as such they are liable to face disciplinary action, the minister said adding, unfortunately laxity in its enforcement had created the present mess. he said the new ordinance promulgated for this purpose had made stringent provisions for discouraging coaching by teachers and now it would be difficult for them to go unpunished. describing coaching by government teachers as a social crime, the minister said that a movement would be launched to mobilise public opinion against the practice in the state. he said while issuance of the ordinance would take time owing to the legal formalities involved, the government would start a social movement to apply moral pressure on such teachers who did not take classes and exploited students by enrolling them in their coaching centres. the minister said in the first phase, a meeting of the presidents and general secretaries of students unions would be convened on november 19 which would be followed by a meeting of teachers' unions. besides, he would be writing to the college principals to identify those engaged in coaching and persuade them to desist from the practice, before government takes any punitive action against them. he said the purpose behind the exercise was to address the problem by creating a social awareness against it and convince the teachers against it. one of the reasons for not going in for tough measures against teachers was that he did not want to act in an arbitrary manner without giving time to them to mend their ways, he said. he refuted allegations that the government succumbed to pressure from teachers' unions regarding issuance of the ordinance keeping in view the coming assembly elections.

5,Cattle mafia slaughter law and cows with impunity,"lucknow: cows have found a saviour in chief minister rajnath singh. alarmed at the large-scale illegal cow slaughter largely due to the loopholes in the existing laws, singh has dashed off a letter to prime minister vajpayee to expedite the up prevention of cow slaughter (amendment) bill, lying with the centre since 1992. the reason behind this, affirm reliable sources, is the dwindling number of cows in the state. according to the official statistics, the number of cows and its progeny in up was reported to be 140 lakh in 1972. this came down drastically to a mere 60 lakh in 1998. the intervening years should have led to a 20 times increase instead of a decline by more than fifty percent, experts feel. they attribute the phenomenon to the large-scale smuggling and slaughter within and outside the state. in a statement dated august 8, 2001 to the state government, which had sought his opinion on the issue, up advocate general rameshwar prasad goyal has categorically listed the threat of extinction cows and its progeny face in up. the only plausible solution to it is doing away with the partial ban as imposed by the original act passed in 1955 and implement a total ban on cow slaughter, says his report. the law at present allows killing of bullocks over 15 years of age or even under it, if ailing. this provision has only helped the cattle mafia who have resorted to indiscriminate slaughter by misusing the provisions, goyal maintains. up, according to an official estimate, is known to export meat/beef worth rs 1000 crore per annum. beef offers big money, as valued at rs 40 a kg it fetches rs 250 per kg abroad provided one has an export licence. interestingly, it all happens in four districts— sahibabad, ghaziabad, bijnor and aligarh— having most number of exporters, most of whom operate illegally. helping them out are the police, politicians, veterinary doctors and even railway officials, claim sources. with the ambiguous laws on their side, unlike in states like rajasthan, haryana, mp delhi or jammu and kashmir which have a total ban on cow slaughter, the cattle mafia in up is a fast growing tribe, which is carrying out its activities surreptitiously but steadily, feels dig lucknow sulkhan singh. the problem needs to be redressed urgently, says rajiv gupta, secretary animal husbandry adding, a total ban would also prevent cruelty to animals. gupta as commissioner gorakhapur had intercepted 350 calves walking their way to bihar with metal shoes nailed to their hooves. most of these animals had developed wounds and sores. and this is certainly not the only incident, he says.

6,'India not told of Abu Salem's arrest',"new delhi: so what about abu salem, the mumbai underworld don wanted in india for bombay serial blasts and scores of extortion cases, now a pakistani passport holder who was reportedly arrested in united arab emirates earlier this week and allegedly let off because india could not establish his true identity? it now transpires that the uae authorities did not ``officially'' intimate india of abu salem's arrest or detention, and that has put a spanner in the process of extradiitng him to india. the external affairs ministry has said it had received no confirmation of salem's arrest or detention from the uae authorities, and top cbi officials said on saturday the agency could not proceed in the absence of official intimation. denying that abu salem had been let off the hook because of the cbi's ``incompetence'' in producing any verification of abu salem's identity, highly placed sources in the cbi on saturday disclosed that the agency had provided to the uae authorities full proof of salem's identity as also his involvement in criminal cases in india weeks before he was taken into custody by the uae authorities. expressing the cbi's ``helplessness'' to act on don's arrest by interpol in sharjah, high-ranking cbi officials, however, denied that they did not react ``immediately and positively'' on the news of his arrest. ``procedurely, we could have reacted in the abu salem case only after we got an official information that he was arrested. at no stage we were informed about his arrest or detention,'' a cbi official said. he disclosed that a team of cbi sleuths had visited uae recently and had briefed the emirates' police as to how important abu salem is to india as far as fighting terrorism or ``breaking the group of the extortionists who are based in foreign lands.'' dismissing as ``baseless'' the claaims that the indian authorities had failed to prove to the uae authorities abu salem's identity, a top cbi official said, ``as a matter of fact, we are one of the agencies which not only have his fingerprints but several other key intelligence on him.'' the cbi ``has shared most of this information with the uae authorities,'' he added. according to cbi information, abu salem has been arrested by the sharjah police. ``there is a strong possibility that he is still under their custody. our information is that he was arrested for several other reasons and not just on india's request made through interpol. we are trying that they involve us in this case, but for now it seems a remote possibility and we can do nothing about it.'' the cbi is ``in touch with the officials of the external affairs ministry as also officials in uae,'' an agency official said. he pointed out that the agency was also exploring other route to get abu salem. ``the director of cbi is the head of interpol in india and we are using our clout with interpol organisation to plead our case,'' the cbi official said, and hoped the ``legal obstacles involved in the case will be surmounted soon.''

7,Fernandes rules out crossing LoC,"pathankot: defence minister george fernandes on saturday ruled out crossing of line of control, but maintained that troops have been kept on constant alert along the indo-pak border in view of the new situation emerging after the us strikes on afghanistan. ""we will not cross loc in any case,"" fernandes told reporters after laying foundation stone of 4000 unit housing colony at mamon military base here. ""if we did not do it during kargil conflict, it was now not a question"", he said. he said that reports of a crisis developing along the border with pakistan is a ""media creation"" and that there was no ""extra ordinary activities"" on this side. he, however, said that in the kind of situation prevailing in the wake of the us strikes on afghanistan, the country's troops have been kept on alert along the border. referring to recent exchange of fire between india and pakistan in the last fortnight, he said the situation is well under control. ""i personally visited siachen and jammu sectors and reviewed the situation"", he added. to a question about pakistan president, general pervez musharraf's battle with extremists in his country, fernandes said that he has a tough job to do. ""musharraf, who nourished taliban, is now getting bullets given by him"", he said.

9,France favours political process in Afghanistan,"new delhi: french special envoy pierre lafrance met external affairs minister jaswant singh and foreign secretary chokila iyer here saturday to discuss future political scenarios for afghanistan in the wake of the ongoing us and british bombing of that country. while france supports the us war, it believes bombing alone will not force the taliban from power and that there is urgent need for all interested countries to foster a political process that can unite the disparate opposition groups around the vision of a representative, multi-ethnic government for afghanistan. in the absence of such initiatives, french officials fear, the heavy bombing of afghanistan would only help to consolidate support for the taliban. in particular, they feel that the mounting civilian casualties in afghanistan will rob the us of moral legitimacy since people around the world will say ``terrorism is terrorism'' whether civilians are killed by commercial airliners striking buildings or by military airplanes dropping bombs and missiles on them. although paris recognises the northern alliance as the legitimate government of afghanistan, france is believed to be keen for a more broad-based set-up to replace the taliban as and when they are forced from power. any government that excludes the southern pashtun tribes will not be representative or stable, it believes. like the us, france too supports the convening of a grand council, or loya jirga, as the first step towards the creation of a new government. but it is wary of the plans announced by the northern alliance and ex-afghan king zahir shah for a more narrowly-based national council. after the taliban regime collapses, paris would ideally want a broad afghan security force to maintain law and order in kabul rather than the northern alliance moving in.

11,KRRS trains its sights on corporate farming,"dharwad: the karnataka rajya raitha sangha (krrs) leader m.d. nanjunda swamy on friday said the sangha would launch an agitation against corporate farming. he told reporters here that the krrs would not allow corporate farming since it would harm the average indian farmer. swamy said the national agriculture policy was framed under pressure from the world bank to suit its requirements and it allowed participation of private sector in farming. ``the karnataka government has no power to evict farmers from their lands'', he added. he accused former prime minister h.d. deve gowda of trying to fish in troubled waters. he added he would not mind gowda intervening the neera movement if the latter was honest in his intentions. ``but that is not so'', swamy said. he warned forest department officials of dire consequences if they ventured into the farmers' bagar hukum lands to evict them. ``there is nothing called bagar hukum cultivation'', he said. in a democratic set up, the government had no right to evict farmers from the lands they had been cultivating for decades without providing an alternative source of livelihood, swamy added. he attributed all the problems faced by farmers to globalisation. when asked whether mushrooming of raitha sanghas weakened the farmers' movement, swamy said he was not worried about fickle minded leaders who changed their ideologies for selfish motives. ``the farmers' movement will be intensified when required. a massive rally of farmers is also scheduled in north karnataka on april 17'', he added. in a scathing attack on political parties nanjunda swamy said they were unfit to be called political parties as they lacked minimum characteristics of a political party. he admitted that the decision of the krrs to launch a political party kannada nadu was hasty. the farmers leader said a `green brigade' consisting of youths would be launched wherein members of the brigade would educate farmers to fight for their rights.

13,NRGs look for investment in Gujarat as US faces threats,"ahmedabad: osama bin laden's chilling threat of more attacks from the skies seems to have had its desired effect. americans today are a scared people, ready to vent their frustration at any one who even vaguely looks like a terrorist to their geographically-ignorant eyes. as a result, many non-resident gujaratis have started investing back into their homeland to escape an increasingly anti-immigrant environment in their adopted country. ""the indian community has received a few hate mail messages,"" confirms sumir meghani of stanford university hindu council. ""we are worried that racial profiling by the authorities may target hindus and sikhs. many nris undertake outings and travel only when it is absolutely necessary."" anxious to safeguard their hard-earned money, nrgs are busy searching for the safest investment options in their home towns. ""many gujaratis in the us are considering investing in their native land. the inquires are rising as the war goes on,"" says vijay shah, director of gujarat industrial infrastructure corporation. the first beneficiaries are real estate agents in ahmedabad as this has traditional favourite for nrg investment. ""the property market is a considerably cool investment option,"" says rajesh thakkar, an nrg. ""the recession and steady land prices are attracting the frightened nrgs."" nilesh patel, a chartered accountant from chicago, says the trend of investing back home emerged long ago. ""however, in the wake of the war, more than 60 per cent of nrgs prefer to have a second base in gujarat. not putting all your eggs in a single basket is the logic."" ""nrgs find investing here easier than before,"" avers mahesh mistry, an nrg and a retired banker. ""investing in banks seems less attractive because of the low interest rates. land is a good option."" mistry's sentiments are echoed by dinesh patel, president of the gujarat institute of housing & estate developers. ""this is the right time for investment when the property market has become a buyers' market,"" he says. better construction rules and more transparency in the construction business have also led to the increased interest. sighting examples of nrgs investing in real estate in the city, vijay shah mentions industrialists based in london who have invested in office and residential properties in the city, and clients from the us who have invested in thousands of acres of farm land. ""this trend has picked up in gujarat with stricter general development control regulation (gdcr) laws and other construction by-laws in place after earthquake."" the cancellation of rent control act has also made it easier for nrgs to invest in property and create income, says shah. today, landlords have the right to have the property vacated when the lease expires. adds sanjay patel, a real estate consultant, ""the trend is not only because ahmedabad is a developing metro but also because, compared to any other developing city like pune, bangalore and hydrabad, land is cheap in ahmedabad."" however, anil bakeri, one of ahmedabad's top builders, says the rising inquiries from nrgs seem impulsive. ""in the past nrgs have burnt their fingers by investing in property here. and this time due to lack of faith in builders, nrgs will take a calculative and calm action, and not jump for investment."" kishor dedhia of space management says, ""nrgs from middle east invest here because they can't invest there. and to attract nrgs from other countries, the local builders need to be bring in more transparency.""

15,Bt.gene cotton row likely to split farmers,"ahmedabad: farmers in gujarat are likely to get split down the middle over the recent controversy on the use of unapproved bt.gene seeds planted in about 9,000 acres in the state as both the state and central governments take divergent stands on the issue. to further complicate the issue, the two largest farmers' organisations in the state have also taken diametrically opposite stances on the issue and are likely to elicit support through representations and public rallies. the sharad joshi-led shetkari sangathan, which has support in the central and south gujarat regions is already preparing for a big rally in bharuch on tuesday to canvass for freedom for the farmers to choose the kinds of agricultural inputs they would like to use. the bharatiya kisan sangathan, a rss-led outfit, will meet chief minister modi in gandhinagar on the same day to warn against a ploy by multinational organisations to make the farmers dependent on these 'terminator' seeds. significantly, while the union ministry of environment has ordered the destruction of these crops, the union textiles ministry has supported the cause of the farmers who have used the genetically-engineered seeds. textiles minister kashiram rana had in fact said the seeds are not only producing better quality cotton but have also withstood the onslaught of pests where other varieties have failed. the gujarat government, which has taken a stand in support of the bt.gene seed, will take up the issue at a meeting convened by the union government in new delhi on wednesday. however, modi, who is close to the rss, will have to take into account the serious reservations which the bks has on the issue. the national secretary of bks, jivanbhai patel has said that the seeds were an attempt by multinational companies to impose terminator seeds on indian farmers so that every year these farmers are forced to purchase seeds from these companies. a well-known proponent of 'swadeshi', it is yet to be seen what stance modi finally takes on the issue. on one hand, kashiram rana and state agriculture minister purshottam rupala are accusing the ""pesticides"" lobby for opposing the new seed, while bks is pointing fingers at the ""terminator seeds lobby"". however, sharad joshi is seeking a wider debate on the issue by inviting farmers' leaders from other states to join the bharuch rally. those who are expected to attend include sardar bhupender singh maan (punjab), chaudhari prem simha dahiya (haryana), p chengal reddy (ap) and the president of kisan co-ordination committee, saroj kashikar. joshi said in a statement that gujarat's farmers have been able to save their crop of cotton from the attack of bolloworms, thanks to the use of a special seed. the crops from all other seeds have been devastated by the pest. use of bt-gene cotton seed in india was blocked by the central ministry of environment and forests last may, even though other cotton producing countries have gone ahead with the use of transgenic cotton. and while others are talking of a ""pesticides lobby"" and a ""terminator seeds lobby"", joshi is referring to a ""green lobby"" in india is going all out to have the crops destroyed. he said the farmers used the seeds that they could procure through normal channels and cannot be faulted if the seed, eventually, turned out to be of transgenic variety. it was government's duty to ensure that the proscribed seed was not marketed. this year, the cotton crop has failed in gujarat with the exception of the proscribed variety.

16,Snap failed to convince UAE,"new delhi: though the union government failed to furnish the uae authorities with original passport and fingerprint records as key evidence to prove that the person detained there was abu salem, home ministry sources said it provided a photograph of salem, flanked by his two begums. the photograph, apparently, was of salem in his younger days when he did not sport a beard. the uae authorities, it is learnt, got back saying that the person in the photograph was not the same as the one who had been detained. however, now the government is considering a fresh attempt to track down the absconders. bureaucratic quarters have suggested sending a joint intelligence team to the uae, namely to dubai, abu dhabi and sharjah, to communicate with the authorities there and take up a fresh 'silent operation' without going to the media about it. the team will also talk to the fbi, here. the proposal is under the home ministry's consideration. home minister advani is said to have spoken to maharashtra chief minister on saturday and the two have apparently decided on an unwritten agreement to consult each other before going public on sensitive issues, since pre-mature leakage damaged their cause. the ministry of external affairs said on saturday that the government is looking into extradition treaties afresh to try and simplify the inherent problems. the mea, however, denied that they had any knowledge of salem being detained and said they were in touch with the indian ambassador in uae. ten days before salem's detention, the intelligence bureau informed the home minister about salem and some other accused in the bombay blasts being present in the uae region. an intelligence team, led by cbi chief p c sharma, with officials of ib and home ministry, was sent to uae. later, the mumbai police team was contacted and its help sought.incidentally, the home ministry's assessment is that the emir of dubai has not been as cooperative in his dealings with the indian government as the emir of abu dhabi.

17,'Upmarket' pastries knock off jalebis,"jalandhar: the halwai of punjab is headed for extinction at the hands of western civilisation's bakery and fast-food culture. a walk through the old bazars of punjabs cities is enough to convince you of this transformation, especially at the advent of the festival season. traditional sweets like the jalebee and balushahi, made of desi ghee, have hardly any buyers now. ""some of the recipes originated from iran and turkey,"" says avinash chander arya, whose forefathers established the halwai business here in 1882. ""it was started by our great grandfather, jatoo mall. we have now lost the art of making a number of sweets that came as a gift from the islamic civilisation."" his shop is sandwiched between some lottery and shoe shops outside the tehsil office on gt road.arya sweets is difficult to locate, unlike the dominos and wimpys in fashionable upmarket areas. a survey shows that halwais are switching trade.while some have entered the fast-food business, others have taken to selling automobiles or even ready-made garments. ramesh mittal, owner of lovely sweets and now also proprietor of lovely autos, says he decided to diversify as his children were not ready to take up the halwai business. ""the peoples eating habits have also changed dramatically in the last one decade.the next generation has decided to visit only fast food joints."" health consciousness is another factor. blood sugar and hypertension are on the rise. ""who would want to eat a jalebee or an imarti soaked in fat-rich rabari?"" asks mittal. ""we have already stopped making such age-old items like the balushahi, shakarpare, seernee, baisan barfee. also extinct now is the messu, channedal and namkeen laddu,"" adds arya. ""the trend is true for the entire country,"" says mittal, who is also president of the punjab halwai union. he adds, ""only in amritsar do some of the old eating habits exist. the puri in desi ghee, lassi and halwa are doing well there. but, in ludhiana, the battle of civilisations has been lost to the west."" kanahiya sweets of amritsar opened a shop in ludhiana but had to close down as the public has lost the taste for traditional sweets. doda sweets in ghumar mandi has switched to fast food and has re-named the shop doda house. gopal sweets in patiala has opened a fast food called gopals upstairs and the rush is unbelievable. novelty sweets on lawrence road in amritsar has switched to selling automobiles. they are now selling bajaj scooters, santro cars and ford tractors. in jalandhar the scene is dismal. the bazars have not even put on the festival season mantle as yet. sodhi sweets shut down two months ago and has begun selling ready-made garments. gurdev singh, a prominent halwai of the city, closed shop and opened a tyres shop. in sabzi mandi a few shops have closed down. in bhagat singh chowk, lyalpurian di hatti has closed down.
