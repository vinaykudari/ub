0,Pre-election surveys are a farce: Sheila,"PUNE: Delhi chief minister and Congress leader Sheila Dixit on Tuesday said she did not agree with the prepoll surveys predicting a swing in favour of the BJP in the northern states.

""Such surveys are always subject to manipulation. They had not predicted a Congress victory in the assembly polls in Delhi, but we came to power,"" she said.

Dixit, who was in Pune to participate in the election campaign rallies of Congress Lok Sabha candidate Suresh Kalmadi, addre-ssed reporters at the Congress Bhavan on Tuesday evening.

She said the BJP had nothing new to offer, barring a personal attack on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, and accused Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and other BJP leaders of launching an ""ugly campaign"" against Sonia.

She said the NDA government had failed to maintain law and order in Delhi.

""Women in Delhi feel insecure. Such is the sorry state of law and order in Delhi.""

She expressed confidence that the Congress would get more seats than the BJP in the ongoing elections.

1,Why pollsters can't agree with each other,"NEW DELHI: While there is near unanimity among all exit polls about the direction of the poll outcome, there are two states where the polls have very dissimilar projections: Bihar and Maharastra.

It is evident from vote projections of exit polls that the contest in Bihar is extremely close.

Close outcomes are hard to predict. A small variation in vote projections can totally upset seat forecasts. It is natural therefore for the exit polls in Bihar to come up with conflicting interpretations.

As for Maharastra, some exit polls see it going whole hog the saffron way, while others have projected a clean sweep for the Congress-NCP alliance.

In both these states, some or the other poll would be proved wrong. The cardinal principle in polling: Don''t trust exit polls when they project very divergent outcomes.

Lack of consistency shows there is something amiss about the polls, in terms of methods employed.

Why do exit polls conducted by various professional agencies offer such varied projections? It primarily stems from the type of methods employed for the analysis of data.

Exit polls employ ballot papers on which respondents are asked to mark the symbol of the party they voted for in the present election and also in the previous election.

Then, most analysts weight present vote with past voting behaviour of the same respondents to compute vote swings in the sample. These swings are then projected on the past actual data to derive vote and seat estimates.

In a situation like Bihar, with the sample data, you can come up with totally opposite projections, depending on whether you weight present voting data of the sample with past assembly or past Lok Sabha vote of respondents.

Respondents often report (due to poor recall) in polls that they voted for the same party in the last LS and assembly polls.

As a result, your swing estimates are the same for the parties since the last Lok Sabha and assembly elections. But, the actual performance of the parties has been different in these two elections; the NDA had swept the last Lok Sabha polls, while the RJD won the assembly polls.

In such situations, it is left to the wisdom of the analyst to pick one of the two projections based on subjective assessment.

Another problem with the weighting method is that it makes predictions difficult when the confirmed voters of a particular party abstain from voting in a large measure, leading to sudden increase or decrease in levels of turnout.

The sample data in such cases fails to capture any swings in any party''s favour. But, in reality, the vote share for a party could drop drastically, not due to voters switching their preference, but due to the reduced turnout of a party''s supporters at the polling booths.

I believe something similar is happening in Orissa, where some polls predict a sweeping majority for the BJD/BJP combine.

The actual sample count in our exit poll shows the race in Orissa is closer than what most polls indicate. The same appears to be true in Gujarat, where Congress supporters seem to have preferred to stay home.

Yet another problem that haunts us is called the ''spiral of silence'': people who vote for a party tend to give the slip to pollsters by not voting in the exit poll.

This leads to the under estimation of that party causing an upsetting forecast. It was often observed in Tamil Nadu. High refusal rate in the exit polls is another cause for worry.

2,Cong huddle: Exit polls feel good,"NEW DELHI: The Congress leadership claims it is not perturbed by the exit poll results. In fact, its analysis is quite optimistic - that the Congress on its own would get around 160 seats and be able to form an alternate government with the help of its allies and the Left Front.

""The NDA in this form will not form the government,"" is how a source close to Congress president Sonia Gandhi analysed the situation on Wednesday.

This surprising buoyancy is for two reasons: One, the Congress leaders believe that the Uttar Pradesh situation has improved and hopes for more as Priyanka and Rahul begin campaigning the whole of Uttar Pradesh.

Two, their internal inputs from Maharashtra, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh indicate a positive swing.

Another factor is the constant decline of the NDA graph as shown by all opinion polls and now the exit polls. Earlier, the NDA was projected to win over 300 seats; this has come down to 260-280 after the first phase.

A Left leader who does not share the Congress leadership''s optimism, however, pointed out that if the NDA did not cross the half-way mark in Maharashtra, Bihar and AP, then the NDA might find it difficult to win 260 seats.

These three states put together have 130 seats and the NDA had won 95 seats of them in 1999. It is a tough task to retain these seats in the face of the Congress'' alliances, he contended.

Vishwajeet Prithvijit Singh, the Congress strategist who conducts in-house polls, this time did a survey on alliances in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Bihar.

""The effect of alliances as shown in the exit polls is definitely there on the ground level. The exit poll results are largely in consonance with the statistical analysis we did in these three states,"" said Singh.

3,Exit polls confuse parties in Bihar,"PATNA: The exit polls for Bihar have confused political parties. While NDA circles are flaunting Aajtak figures according to which they got eight of the 11 seats in the first phase on Tuesday, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav insisted it was NDTV which was on the ""right track"". NDTV gave RJD and its allies a total of seven.

In the past, exit polls failed to capture the mood of the electorate. After the 2002 Assembly polls, exit poll by one of the channels showed Laloo''s RJD bagging less than 60 of the 324 seats in the then undivided Bihar. Laloo not only got more than double of the predicted number but also got more seats than the NDA.

""There are always chances of errors in a society as diverse as Bihar where caste, sub-caste, class, regional racialism and other factors influence voting pattern,"" remarked noted social economist Saibal Gupta.

For exit polls to be correct, the elections have to be free and fair. But in Bihar, fairness of elections has always been disputed with charges and counter-charges of booth-loot, violence and intimidation of voters.

In Patna, after Tuesday''s election, both BJP and RJD candidates, C P Thakur and Ram Kripal Yadav, demanded repolling in more than 70 booths. Gupta agreed those conducting exit polls in Bihar usually commit a ""methodological error"" of treating castes and creeds as a block supporting one particular party in the entire state.

The ground reality is different. If Rajputs are the main force behind RJD''s Vijay Krishna against Union minister Nitish Kumar of JD-U in Barh, the same caste clamours to see RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav biting the dust in Chapra. Muslims may be regarded as a significant block in RJD''s ''Muslim Yadav (MY)'' factor but in Sheohar, a significant number of Muslims back Anwarul Haque of the BJP.

There was a clear division of Yadav votes in the last parliamentary polls as six candidates belonging to the caste were elected on NDA''s ticket while the RJD was able to send only one Yadav to the Lok Sabha.

One thing is certain. That poor governance during the last 14 years of Laloo-Rabri regime is a big issue in this election. One should not be surprised if voters in Bihar throw their weight behind non-Laloo parties as most of the exit polls show.

4,One killed in Hardwar clashes,"HARDWAR, Uttaranchal: One person was killed and 35 injured in clashes between policemen and traders after some inebriated constables harassed the wife of a local businessman at the Ardh Kumbh site here on Tuesday night.

Curfew was clamped in certain parts of the town on Wednesday, when the pitched battle continued till afternoon.

The injured included nine policemen and five journalists.

Trouble began late on Tuesday night, when Ravi Jain and some other traders were registering their protest over his wife''s harassment.

At this, the policemen turned aggressive and fired at the group. Clashes ensued, and curfew was imposed only after the district magistrate and the superintendent of police were gheraoed in the Kotwali area by angry traders.

The district administration admitted that the policemen fired without provocation and also defied orders from superiors. Three constables have been suspended from service, pending an inquiry into the incident by an incumbent judge of the Uttaranchal High Court.

This correspondent witnessed the policemen using brutal, unnecessary force on those who had nothing to do with the clashes. Even youngsters fell victim to their excesses.

Chief minister Narayan Datt Tiwari told reporters on Wednesday evening that the Chief Justice of the state high court had agreed to allow his colleague, Judge Irshad Hussain, to conduct the inquiry. The report is to be given within a month.

Tiwari also announced Rs 2.5 lakh compensation to the kin of the deceased, Kali, who worked in a shop there. The injured have been promised a compensation of Rs 50,000 and free medical treatment.

State police chief P D Raturi admitted that it took time to restore order. A decision on lifting the curfew will be taken on Thursday. It was imposed in areas west of the Gang Nahar and in the Kotwali area.

5,'Tulsi' a hit with in-laws,"NEW DELHI: The in-law community of Smriti Malhotra Irani say that the ''outsider'' bahu doesn''t put on airs. Wise girl.

It would cut no ice with the straight-talking Iranis who call a spade a trowel, and would shovel in swear words as routinely as a load of manure to add muscle to their opinion.

They add approvingly that Smriti has also been known to travel second class on the Flying Ranee, while doing her weekend commute to Dahanu, her sasural, from Mumbai.

So, perhaps, Govinda has to worry about her more than Kapil Sibal does.

6,Gujarat govt opposes Best transfer,"NEW DELHI: The Gujarat government on Wednesday questioned the Supreme Court''s order transferring the Best Bakery case to a Maharashtra court for retrial.

The Bench comprising Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Pasayat couldn''t have passed such an order as the issue of transfer of the case was never prayed for, nor argued upon by the parties, Gujarat government counsel Mukul Rohtagi said.

Also, the transfer issue was pending before a Bench headed by Chief Justice V N Khare, he said and wondered how some other Bench could pass such an order.

Rohtagi questioned the order when SC was hearing an NHRC plea, seeking transfer of 12 cases related to post-Godhra violence.

7,"Won on cricket? Get set, bet on polls","NEW DELHI: Bookies in Delhi don''t want to miss out on the election action, close on the heels of the millions they made in the Indo-Pak cricket series.

The stakes range from the seven seats of Delhi right up to NDA coming to power again. Bookies are at ease about bets on Atal Bihari Vajpayee continuing as Prime Minister.

A Rs 100 bet on Vajpayee winning could fetch you Rs 110, a return of just Rs 10. And Sonia Gandhi is not second favourite with the bookies.

Going by the initial rates, a Rs 100 bet on BJP''s L K Advani offers a return of Rs 70 making him a distant second in the race to become PM. A bet on Sonia winning could get a return of Rs 150.

The fact that most exit polls after the first round of voting gave NDA a commanding, if not decisive, lead over Congress has further raised BJP''s stock with the bookies.

While there was a return of Rs 50 on NDA crossing the 300-mark before the first round of voting on April 20, it has now dipped to Rs 30.

""Congress and partners were earlier favoured for 150, but they are now pegged at 130,"" said a bookie operating from the Jama Masjid area.

In the capital, BJP is tipped to retain the south, outer, east and New Delhi constituencies with ease. The rates have remained almost the same as last week except in the case of Chandni Chowk.

In south Delhi, V K Malhotra is the overwhelming favourite with a return of Rs 10. A bet on Lal Bihari Tiwari in east fetches a return of Rs 30, against Rs 110 on his rival Sandeep Dixit.

In outer Delhi, there is a return of Rs 35 on Sahib Singh Verma as against Rs 60 on Sajjan Kumar.

10,SC lawyers say EVMs can be tampered with,"NEW DELHI: Is there any possibility of tampering with the EVMs? A group of Supreme Court lawyers do not rule out such a posssibility and want printers to be attached to this ballot box-free franchise system to resolve any dispute.
