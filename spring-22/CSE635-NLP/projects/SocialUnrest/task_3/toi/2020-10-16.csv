0,Policemen can arrest women: SC,"NEW DELHI: The police is now free to arrest any woman in a criminal case without having a lady constable around. The Supreme Court has ruled that it is not mandatory for the police to arrest a woman only in the presence of a lady constable.

However, absence of a lady constable would be allowed only if the police felt that securing her presence would delay the process of law. A Bench of Justices N Santosh Hegde an B P Singh modified a direction of the Bombay High Court that said no female persons would be detained or arrested without the presence of a lady constable and in no case, after sunset.

The HC direction had come in a case in which one Junious Adam Illamatti, was arrested by the Nagpur crime branch on June 23, 1993. He died in custody. When his wife, Jarina Adam, went to the police station to inquire about him, she was molested by police.

The Bench agreed with the object behind the direction issued by the high court, but said, â€˜â€˜We think a strict compliance of the said direction, in a given circumstance, would cause practical difficulties to the investigating agency and might even give room for evading the process of law by unscrupulous accused.â€™â€™

The modified direction is: â€˜â€˜While arresting a female person, all efforts should be made to keep a lady constable present.â€™â€™

1,Muslim bodies demand arrest of VHP leaders,"MUMBAI: Three Muslim organisations â€” Jamia Qadria Ashrafia, Tanzeem Aimmae Masajid and the Raza Academy â€” have demanded the immediate arrest of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders â€œfor threatening to start riotsâ€™â€™ if they are not allowed to hold a rally at Ayodhya on Friday.

Representatives of the three organisations, Maulana Saiyad Musannah Miyan,M.Khaliburrehman Noori and Mohammed Saeed Noori, told newspersons here on Thursday that the VHPâ€™s brazen threat of violence has created a strong feeling of insecurity among the nationâ€™s Muslims.

The minority community is particularly worried since the BJP-led government at the Centre is â€œtacitly endorsingâ€™â€™ the statements of the VHP.

The governmentâ€™s failure to act against the VHP has made a complete mockery of the constitution, Maulana Musannah Miyan observed.

He warned that Muslims would be compelled to act in self-defence if the government failed to counter the the VHPâ€™s â€œterrorist tactics.â€™â€™ The government would be solely responsible if Muslims act to counter VHP-sponsored violence.

Maulana Musannah Miyan said that despite large-scale violence against Muslims in Gujarat, the community did not react. He appealed to the secular establishment to ensure that the rule of law is maintained in the country.

â€œWe want peace at all costs. And it is the primary duty of the government to maintain peace,â€™â€™ he noted.

2,Police arrest minor boy in train robbery case,"PATNA: Police on Thursday arrested a minor boy in connection with the Wednesday night train robbery case in the Rajgir-Danapur passenger train near the outer signal of the Patna Junction. The 12-year-old boy, Raju Dom, has confessed his involvement in the crime. The police also recovered most of the looted articles.

â€œThe boy hurled two bombs at us to secure the release of two of his associates who were caught after the robbery,â€� said Indrajit Singh, who works in the postal department and is a complainant in the case.

Railway SP Vinay Kumar said that this was a new gang which had started operating around the Patna Junction area. â€œOur police team could not believe him to be involved in the incident after he was taken into custody from a â€˜rain baseraâ€™ in the Nala Road area. However, the boy confessed his guilt after the recovery of the looted articles. The other members of the gang are of the same age group.

â€œOne of my friends, Raiji Dom, had introduced me to the gang. My father died about a decade back. I was facing financial crisis. On Wednesday night, I got a sum of Rs 1,300 as my share after the crime,â€� the boy told the police.

Kumar said that the gang members target only those trains which stop near the outer signals. â€œThey spend their time near the railway tracks between the Rajendra Nagar and the Yarpur rail-way crossings. If a train stops near an outer signal before reaching the Patna Junction due to some or the other reason, the criminals grab the opportunity and commit crime in the train, he said. He said he will hold talks with the railway authorities to avoid any such circumstances that cause stoppage of trains at such vulnerable points.

Kumar further said that the Patna GRP has evolved certain strategies to control crime in trains. â€œWe are getting active support from all the district police falling under the area of Patna GRP. â€œAfter conducting a series of raids in the Gaya district, we arrested 12 persons who were involved in different cases of crime, he said and added that the prize catch for the railway police was one Sipahi Paswan, who was arrested from the Paraia village in the Gaya district. â€œWe also recovered articles snatched from passengers during the recent robbery in the Janata Express near the Athmal Gola Halt,â€� he said.

3,Tension at MGIT campus over student's suicide,"HYDERABAD: Mild tension prevailed at the campus of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology (MGIT) on Thursday, when college students, with the support of youth-wing leaders of the TRS and the ABVP, held a demonstration to protest the death of a second-year engineering student, Prashanth Kumar, who reportedly jumped to his death from the fourth floor of the college building on Wednesday.

The college management, however, is believed to have agreed to terminate the services of three lecturers who allegedly harassed Prasha-nth, following which he is said to have committed suicide.

A decision to this effect was taken during a meeting held between the management and youth-wing leaders Ram Mohan (TRS) and Shashidhar (ABVP) and others.

The management said a decision regarding ex-gratia to the bereaved family members would be taken later.

Earlier, the management reportedly detained the students inside the college by threatening action against students who join hands with youthwing leaders.

Forensic experts who conducted the post-mortem, said Prashanth had committed suicide. Police have registered a case against the three lecturers â€” Srinivas Reddy, Karimullah Khan and Bhanu Chander â€” for abetment to commit suicide.

5,City votes for blanket ban on rallies & bandhs,"KOLKATA: â€œThe michhilnagari is getting a bit too much.â€� This is the popular refrain doing the rounds in the city, says an opinion poll by the Times FCR.

An overwhelming 68 per cent of the respondents felt there should be a blanket ban on processions, both on weekdays and holidays.

Another 28 per cent was not averse to rallies as such, albeit with reasonable restrictions. Yet, three per cent maintained that rallies should continue unfettered. The remaining one per cent refused to comment.

Sending across clear signals of the cityâ€™s changing psyche, the survey pointed out that a whopping 61 per cent had faith in the judiciary and wanted the court to force the government into imposing restrictions on bandhs and rallies.

There is another view, too. A minor 21 per cent of the sample size believed that restrictions, if any, should come from the government and not the judiciary.

Similarly, 18 per cent of the respondents reserved their opinions on the issue. Whatever their opinions about the organs of the state, citizens were yet to leave the matter to spontaneity.

For, a sizeable section preferred the government to frame rules to discipline those holding the city to ransom with rallies. Remarkably, 51 per cent clearly felt the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has the political will as opposed to the 41 per cent who doubted its intention to buckle rallies.

Incidentally, a wafer-thin eight per cent is fully convinced of the governmentâ€™s will. Despite the issue having assumed centrestage, most of the respondents held that the ruling Frontâ€™s defiance has not tarnished the governmentâ€™s investor-friendly image.

Thirty-five per cent refused to consider West Bengal an investment-friendly state. They felt it has already missed the bus, whatever the reason.

A large chunk â€“ 58 per cent â€“ agreed to the proposition that the state government was investor-friendly and the Left Frontâ€™s defiance was not enough to dent that.

Again, a dwindling seven per cent failed to come up with a clear response. The survey revealed something unusual, too: 20 per cent of the sample, comprising mostly working men and women between 26 and 35, was not aware of the courtâ€™s initial restrictions on rallies and meetings on weekdays, that was stayed later.

However, the survey has nothing to do with Justice Lalaâ€™s judicial order and refrained from commenting on it either.

6,Hasan promises a different govt,"LUCKNOW: Here is one minister who dislikes the sound of hooter. ""Moving in the public place with siren blaring not only sounds vulgar it also antagonises the masses,"" declared the minister for family welfare Ahmad Hasan on Thursday.

You wonâ€™t find many ministers creating a commotion on roads during the present regime, claimed the former leader of the opposition in the Vidhan Parishad, adding that he personally did not propose to use the siren and has been advising his other ministerial colleagues to shun the practice.

This is one government which not only claims to be different but would also appear to be different from itâ€™s predecessor, he said. â€œWe actually aim at austerity as against the lip service paid by our political rivals,â€� Hasan said, referring specifically to the chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s decision to travel by economy class.

Though the minister was quick to confess that he was still learning the ropes of the family welfare department he listed greater transparency in the administration as one of his top priorities. Unlike the past regime, his endeavour would be to ensure that the department functioning or decisions were not not made a topic of speculations and public had access to relevant information, he declared.

Corruption in the health sector, including family welfare department was another issue which deserved immediate attention, he pointed out. In fact, when senior health functionaries called upon him after he took charge of the ministry, he did a little plainspeak by telling them that he was aware of what the CAG report had to say about the department. â€œSince I had raised the issues mentioned in the report as the leader of the opposition in Parishad, I remembered the details,â€� said the minister, who also assured that he wonâ€™t have the repeat of similar charges this time.

It could take a little time because the family welfare department is huge, the largest perhaps, as far as the number of staff was concerned, he said, â€œso an overnight purge cannot be expected.â€� But once I got the grip of affairs, things would move at a fast pace, he said.

Then improving rural infrastructure for family welfare and providing them with better support also deserve attention, said Hasasn, adding â€œand so does eradication of polio.â€� My attempts would be to mobilise the official machinery and seek support from all to make the drive a success, he added.

7,400 VHP activists arrested at Sultanpur Jn,"LUCKNOW: Around 400 VHP activists were arrested when they refused to alight from a passenger train from Allahabad to Faizabad. The security forces persuaded them for more than three hours to get off the train. The train had to be halted at Sultanpur junction from 12.55 pm to 4.35 pm on Thursday.

Sources said when Railway authorities had asked the reason for delaying the train, the police had issued a written statement that they were checking the train for explosives. While the total number of arrests in Sultanpur touches 1,000, who are all lodged in the Sultanpur jail, the 400 arrested on Thursday were taken to the Dhammaur Inter College which has been converted into a temporary jail, said sources.

Police sources claimed that they had not used force on VHP activists, as a result of which the train had to be delayed for more time than necessary.

In Rae Bareli, 29 VHP activists were arrested at the Gadaganj Railway station while they were about to board a train to proceed towards Ayodhya. District police chief Alok Singh said they had been sent to jail.

Police are keeping a round the clock vigil on all main roads, rail and bus stations with a view to prevent VHP supporters from congregating at Ayodhya, which would inevitably create a law and order problem.

8,VHP chief Ashok Singhal arrested,"AYODHYA: Arrested by the Mulayam Singh government early on Friday morning, VHP chief Ashok Singhal has called for a Bharat bandh on October 19.

Singhal and senior VHP leader Ram Vilas Vedanti were arrested here while on their way to perform the Sankalp Sabha at Karsevakpuram. More than 5000 Ram bhakts were also taken into custody.

Gorakhpur MP Adityanath, who was arrested by the police while proceeding towards Faizabad from Gorakhpur, was released following pressure from the youth wing of the VHP.

Security forces fired over 35 tear gas shells and had to resort lathicharge to disperse the gathering. The UP administration had banned the VHP meet late on Thursday night after talks with the Parishad failed.

The UP Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had offered an olive branch on Friday afternoon suggesting that the sammelan to reiterate the resolve to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya, be held at a venue beyond the stipulated 5 km radius of the disputed Babri Masjid-Ramjanmbhoomi site.

The VHP, however rejected this, and insisted on holding its convention as scheduled. Faizabad divisional commissioner J P Sharma, who was negotiating on behalf of the state government, told the TNN that â€œno one would be allowed to hold any assembly within a radius of 5 km in Ayodhya"".

An angry VHP is also going ahead with its programme to jam road and rail routes throughout UP from 10 am to 2 pm on Friday. Ram bhakts are gathering and taking to the streets singing bhajans while blocking road and rail traffic.

Meanwhile, security has been further beefed up in and around Ayodhya.

Agency reports said that police fired few rounds in the air to disperse the gathering.

10,J&K govt committed to peace: Mufti,"ALIGARH: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed on Friday said his government was committed to maintaining peace in the state at any cost and desperate attacks by militants would be no hinderance in its resolve.

""Such attack''s were only aimed at derailing the peace process,"" Sayeed told reporters here referring to the attack on his official residence in Srinagar on Friday morning.

He said his government would continue to maintain peace in the state and defeat the nefarious designs of the militants.

Asked whether he would hold Pakistan responsible for the attack, Sayeed said ""this is obvious. Those coming from Pakistan are not able to digest peace in the state, hence they resort to such nefarious activities.""

The chief minister said militants were also frustrated with the fact that the local support for them had almost vanished from the state.

""With the changed international scenario, terrorism is defeating everything. Gun is no solution,"" he said.

As relief and jubilation engulfed the control room, President A P J Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister A B Vajpayee, who were watching the mission from Delhi, talked to the ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair over phone to congratulate the ISRO team for the impressive performance.

Addressing the scientist in the control room after injecting the satellite into the SSO, Nair said: ""ISRO has done the country proud again. Today the eight launch of the PSLV, carrying the Resourcesat, one of the most sophisticated satellites, has been a tremendous achievement as far as the nation is concerned.""

""It has been a success flight, meticulously performed with precise instrumentation on board for improving the earth observation capabilities for years to come. The Resourcesat will observe the earth from an altitude of 821 km. Today we had the opportunity to carry a Resourcesat with a most sophisticated camera system. It is one of the finest experiments we have made so far. It was the first launch in such climatic circumstance. It has proved that the subsystems are rain proof and the vehicle has demonstrated its capacity for all weather condition.""

Later addressing the media, Nair admitted that the weather was a concern, but the remarkable mission has put the satellite in the precise orbit of 821 km, a ""world class mission"".

Even the velocity with which the satellite was injected into the orbit was also precise. The path did not deviate even once.

The satellite carried with it three cameras - a high resolution linear imaging self scanner (LISS), a medium resolution LISS-3 and an Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS).

Apart from the three cameras Resourcesat-1 would also carry a Solid State Recorder with a capacity of 120 giga bits to store the images taken by its cameras which can be read out later to the ground stations.

13,BJYM to hold rallies against Antony govt,"KANNUR: The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha on Friday said it would launch massive protest rallies across Kerala to highlight the ""ineffective rule"" of the UDF Government owing to ''the ongoing mudslinging by Congress factions'' in the state.

Surendran alleged that the Antony government had failed to initiate action against those who were said to have hatched conspiracy to murder BJYM State Vice-President Jayakrishnan in 1999 and a few senior police officials indicted by the court for scuttling the investigation even three months after the court verdict in the case.

He said the UDF Government had conceded most of the demands raised by the Hindu Aikyavedi thereby leading to a more or less amicable settlement to the Marad issue.

16,'VHP' prosecutors for riot cases stoke controversy,"NEW DELHI: Though the Supreme Court had warned the Gujarat government against retaining the same prosecutors in the High Court who had earlier appeared in different violence cases resulting in acquittals, an NGO seeking justice for the victims said on Friday that only those who were directly linked to the ruling BJP or VHP were given the job.

Teesta Setalvadâ€™s affidavit in the apex court said that the Best Bakery case public prosecutor (PP) was one Raghuvir Pandya, who was a member of RSS and a card-holding member of BJP.

One Chetan Shah, a VHP supporter, was appointed as PP in two major cases, including the Gulberg society massacre in which Congress former MP Ahsan Jafri was brutally killed along with 70 others, she said. And Dilip Trivedi, general secretary of Mehsana district unit of VHP, was PP in the case of the Sardarpura carnage, she said.

Former solicitor-general Harish Salve, who is assisting the court in the Gujarat violence cases, suggested that the entire panel of public prosecutors be vetted by attorney-general Soli J Sorabjee.

However, Gujaratâ€™s counsel and additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi said that new special public prosecutors for the riot cases were now being appointed in consultation with its advocate-general.

He said that the list of special public prosecutors would soon be sent to Sorabjee for vetting. Sorabjee said that he would make suggestions on the names of the PPs after taking into account the views of all concerned.

17,SC tightens screws on Modi govt,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Gujarat government to submit a status report regarding the investigation and trial of 12 other violence-related cases in which a large number of persons were killed in 2002.

A Bench of Chief Justice VN Khare, Justices SB Sinha and AR Lakshmanan sought the details by October 31 of cases relating to the Godhra train carnage, and the massacres in Chamanpura (Gulbarg society), Naroda Patia, Sardarpura, Kidiad and Pandharwada.

Taking serious note of an affidavit filed by Teesta Setalvad of Citizens for Peace and Justice that though over a year had elapsed since the trial courts acquitted all the accused in killing 157 Muslims in three other cases the state government was yet to appeal against it, the court issued notice to the Modi government and fixed November 7 to hear the matter.

The court would also consider then whether the ongoing trials in all the Gujarat violence cases should be stayed or not. Former solicitor-general Harish Salve, who is assisting the court in the Gujarat violence matters, urged the court to ask the state government to plead for a re-investigation into the Best Bakery case before the High Court.

When counsel for some of the Best Bakery accused, KTS Tulsi, said that monitoring of the cases by the court might cause prejudice to the rights of the accused and the High Court could be influenced by its terse observations, the Bench said it had never commented on the merits of the case.

It asked the High Court to decide the appeals without taking into account whatever observations were made during the course of hearing on the petitions filed the National Human Rights Commission seeking a CBI investigation in the cases and also transfer of the trial to a place outside Gujarat. It also rejected Tulsiâ€™s allegations that the media had distorted the courtâ€™s observations. â€œBy and large I have not found anything wrong in the press reports,â€� CJI Khare said.

MEDIA REPORTING FAIR: SC

The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed allegations by the accused in the Best Bakery case that the media had distorted the courtâ€™s observations during the hearing of the appeal filed by the NHRC which caused â€˜immense prejudiceâ€™ to their right to a fair trial.

19,Gujarat riots: Gulbarg hearing deferred,"AHMEDABAD: The city sessions court on Friday deferred the further hearing in the Gulbarg Society massacre case to November 4, on the application filed by seven witnesses, urging police to investigate further into the matter and also record certain names of accused that were omitted in the chargesheet.

Thirty-nine persons, including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri were butchered and then burnt to death in the Meghaninagar police station area on February 28 last year.

Special Public Prosecutor (SPP), V K Atre argued that the application moved under Section 173 (8) CrPC should not be accepted as the case is now being investigated by the city Crime Branch and that the witnesses should have approached them long ago for making additional statements.

He contented before the court of city sessions judge G B Ahuja that if the witnesses did not have faith in Meghaninagar area police, that conducted the probe first and filed the chargesheet, then they should have approached the Crime Branch after the case was handed over to them by a competent authority.

The SPP also argued that such an application should have been signed by one or more witnesses rather then the advocate who filed it on their behalf.
