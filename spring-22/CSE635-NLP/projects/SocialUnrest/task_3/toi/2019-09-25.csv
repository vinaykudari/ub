0,Revenue minister threatens stir over MSP issue,"BATHINDA: Minister of state for revenue Amarjit Singh Samra has threatened that the state government would be forced to launch an agitation against the Centre on the issue of delay in the announcement of minimum support price (MSP) for paddy unless concrete steps were taken by the Centre soon.

While issuing a threat to block railway traffic and starting a dharna in protest against the Union government, Samra alleged that inordinate delay in announcement of MSP and non-start of procurement on the part of the Centre was intentional and it was trying to create problems for the state government for political reasons.

He said the Union government was in a mood to start paddy procurement from October, this would not solve the problems for the farmers as last year by the same time 28 lakh metric tonnes of paddy had arrived in various mandiâ€™s in the state.

He said that the delegation of leaders led by chief minister captain Amarinder Singh that went to meet deputy prime minister and the Union food minister on Monday did not get the response that such a delegation was expected to.

The minister said in a situation where paddy production in the country was expected to drop by 20 million tonnes and the food stocks of previous years were not of good quality, the Union government should be forthcoming in starting early procurement this season.

Samra and many scientists of Punjab Agriculture University(PAU) were here onTuesday to participate in a Kisan Mela.

K S Aulakh, vice chancellor of PAU said that besides a substantial increase in MSP, the farmers in the state should be provided Rs 100 per quintal as bonus to compensate them. He said as per a calculation by the university it was found the cost of production for one quintal paddy was Rs 649 this season.

Aulakh said that though preliminary estimates showed that total kharif output would drop by 20-25 per cent in the country due to the dry spell, in Punjab, however, it was hoped there would be no sizable decrease in foodgrains production this season.

1,DF govt seeks Centre's clarification on Goregaon golf course,"MUMBAI: The state urban development department has written to the environment ministry in Delhi asking it to clarify the permission it gave to Usha Madhu Co-operative Development Housing Society to construct an 18-hole golf course in Goregaon (west).

The clarification has been sought after complaints by city environmentalists and local activists that hundreds of acres of eco-sensitive mangroves have been chopped to clear the land for the golf course. Only the environment ministry has the power to revoke the permission.

On Tuesday, principal secretary (environment and energy) Ravi Buddhiraja held a meeting in Mantralaya with civic officials among others to discuss the controversial project. The proposed golf course is coming up on 550 acres earmarked as a no-development zone behind Millat Nagar housing society in Andheri.

The sprawling land belongs to the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy group, which has entered into an agreement with the Usha Madhu society to develop the golf course.

The developers have denied that mangroves ever existed on the land. According to them, the Rs 200 crore project is being built on marshy land. However, local environmentalists like Pravin Choudhary claim they have photographic evidence to prove that the land was once full of mangroves.

â€œWe recently managed to get a picture of the area taken about a decade ago.One can clearly see a huge growth of mangroves. Almost all of it has been ruthlessly hacked now,â€™â€™ Mr Choudhary said.The satellite imagery of this area prior to 1997 also shows the presence of the mangrove forest.

According to sources, the building proposal department of the BMC had given permission to the developers to go ahead with the project. However, a stop work notice was issued recently following complaints about mangroves being chopped.

â€œDespite the stop work notice, work is going on at full speed,â€™â€™ Mr Choudhary alleged. Last week, the Mangrove Society of India dashed off a letter to municipal commissioner Karun Srivastava that work on the golf course was going on despite the fact that the BMC had not issued the commencement certificate to the developer.

The letter said that the complete area was covered with mangroves until two years ago. â€œHence, we understand that the reclamation is a blatant violation of the Coastal Regu l a t i o n Zone Act,â€™â€™ it said. The society further pointed out that the environment ministry had conceded that mistakes may have been made while giving permission. â€œThe periphery of the total reclaimed area is still covered by mangroves and the seawater during the high tide still reaches the site,â€™â€™ it observed.

The society has submitted as proof two photographs taken in 1992 and 1998 when mangroves were flourishing.

Several housing societies in Andheri (west) have also written to environment minister T. Balu about the devastation of the mangroves. â€œWe would like to inform you that already our area (Oshiwara-Lokhandwala) is one of the most congested areas in Mumbai. The urban infrastructure like roads, garbage, sewage disposal is already under tremendous strain. By allowing more development and that too at the cost of crucial ecosystem, would prove to be disastrous,â€™â€™ residents of Movie Tower co-operative housing society said. Other housing societies like Shishira and Casa Blanca have written similar protest letters to the environment minister.

Mangroves prevent soil erosion and stabilise the local environment to ward off extremes in temperature.

In addition, they protect the mainland from the wrath of the sea and provide cover for a variety of fish and bird life to breed.

2,Teachers announce bandh on October 10,"LUDHIANA: The state executive committee of Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachersâ€™ Union (PCCTU) has decided to observe â€˜total education bandhâ€™ in the state besides staging a protest rally in front of chief minister Amarinder Singhâ€™s Patiala residence on October 10 on account of the government failure to honour its poll promises concerning their long-pending demands.

Addressing the zonal protest rally at mini-secretariat here on Tuesday, PCCTU state president SS Hundal said they were compelled to take this decision against the government because it continued to ignore their genuine demands after coming to power.

Hundal condemned the government for its decisions regarding modified pension/gratuity scheme, imposition of 10 per cent annual cut on regular grants and non-inclusion of colleges and posts under 95 per cent grantin-aid scheme.

A number of teachers from private aided and unaided colleges of Ludhiana, Muktsar, Moga, Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur district participated in the rally.

Punjab Government College Teachers Union president Jaipal Singh, former Punjab Agricultural University Teachersâ€™ Association president Hari Singh Brar also addressed the rally and extended their support.

3,No street-tactics for board exams protest: Sena,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena will not adopt its trade-mark street- savvy tactics to pressure the Maharashtra government into scrapping the proposed board exam for Std IV students, party leader Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday.

â€œThe issue is related to education. The Senaâ€™s time-honoured techniques will not be employed to oppose the exam.

Instead, the party will hold more meetings in a bid to evolve public opinion,â€™â€™ Mr Thackeray told media persons after a three-hour conclave of parents, teachers and school children in a suburban auditorium. The well-attended conclave was organised by the Sena as part of the partyâ€™s on- going crusade against the state governmentâ€™s recent decision to conduct board exam for Std. IV.

The Sena will direct its MLAs to generate a debate on the issue in their constituencies in rural areas, Mr Thackeray said, adding, the scene is worse in villages as â€œthere are no proper schools and teachers are made to run errands. There are no wellequipped libraries or laboratories.â€™â€™

Addressing the meeting, Mr Thackeray urged parents and teachers to support the Senaâ€™s stand on the proposed board exam for Std IV.

â€œThis is not a political issue which will strengthen the Sena. Our party can choose other issues to take on the Congress-led state government. We have taken up this issue as it affects the future of your children,â€™â€™ said Mr Thackeray. He even made party MP Sanjay Nirupam read out from a newspaper report on the observations made by the office of the Comptroller General of India on the woeful state of schools in Maharashtra.

Earlier, former minister and senior Sena leader Pramod Navalkar derided the Maharashtra government for not taking parents, teachers and the Opposition into confidence before deciding to hold a board exam for Std IV. â€œIt is the state government which will have to face a litmus test. It will have to face the Senaâ€™s ire on the issue,â€™â€™ declared Mr Navalkar.

Former education minister Sudhir Joshi hotly contested the state education departmentâ€™s claim that the idea behind conducting a board exam for Std IV was mooted by him as education minister in the Sena-BJP government in 1997. â€œA committee of experts, of which I was the head, had only made a recommendation. The committee had also suggested that there should be no exams for Std I, Std II and Std III. However, the present government is twisting facts to blame the Sena,â€™â€™ said Mr Joshi.

In a scathing indictment of the state government, Rekha Vijayakar, a senior teacher with Guru Hari Krishna high school in Khar, said the proposed exam will generate fear and hatred among the young school children for the educational system.

â€œThere will be no joy of learning,â€™â€™ she said, adding, â€œThe need of the hour is to improve the infrastructural facilities in schools. Teachers have been reduced to contract labourers on a meagre salary of Rs 3,500. Even a BMC sweeper earns more than us,â€™â€™ said Ms Vijayakar.

Principal Ajay Kaul of Childrenâ€™s Welfare high school in Versova said the schools in Mumbai were not yet prepared for the board exam.

4,Foreign diplomats mum on J&K polls,"SRINAGAR: Diplomats travelling through Kashmir for the second phase of elections described the turnout outcome as a mixed one. While most remained tight-lipped on their experiences, a few said the response of Kashmiri voters varied in different areas.

While they didnâ€™t come across complaints of electoral malpractices, they also encountered few instances of coercion. â€˜â€˜There are things that merit investigation by the Election Commission,â€™â€™ Belleli Massimo of the Italian Embassy said at the end of the day. Massimo said the elections were largely well-organised, for which the state government had worked hard. Massimo said he saw no evidence of militant threats or fear of terrorists during his travel. Another diplomat, requesting anonymity, said the experience was too varied to be generalised. He, however, added that the visit had provided a first-hand insight of how difficult things were here.

Diplomats also pointed out that media had been too eager to lump the entire international community together, describing responses from the United States and the UK as the response of the international community. They pointed out that, in fact, most countries had not yet pronounced a judgment on the elections and that they had not called it as free and fair. They were withholding their opinion until the completion of the entire electoral process, it was stated.

5,Unsung heroes of the elections in J&K,"SRINAGAR: The largely incident-free second round of the Jammu and Kashmir elections will make Fakre Alam, a school teacher from Barabanki, happy. Alam plans to abandon the government-supplied bullet proof vest and an armoured headband, that passes for a helmet in Kashmir, in the next phase.

Alam is one of hundreds of polling officers who have been imported into the state to ensure ""free and fair"" elections. ""We were very worried when we first came here, now we realise things are not that bad,"" says his companion, Ram Pal Singh Tomar, who works at the horticulture department in Meerut.

Constable Lal Bahadur Singh, guarding a polling booth at Arigam, is more stoic. After fighting insurgents in Tripura for three years, he is now in Kashmir. ""We have had no rest,"" he says, ""But I suppose thatâ€™s part of the job.""

Its people like Alam, Tomar and Singh who are the unsung heroes of the success that the elections have had till now. The poll officers have come from all walks of life and have lived with the CRPF or the Army for the past month. Most have not tasted the superlative Kashmiri cuisine and have had to content themselves with the campâ€™s dal roti.

""Last night we managed to have a feast,"" says Syed Mohammed Zuhair, a plant protection officer from Lucknow. ""My Kashmiri colleagues provided us some halal kababs which we could not have in the camp.""

Comparisons are inevitable. Aridaman Jain, a draughtsman from Meerut, says the polling fervour he witnessed in the Khansahib constituency ""was better than Meerut,"" adding that polling in the forenoon was at the rate of 100 an hour.

But, there is little doubt that the toughest job is done by the paramilitary, the CRPF in particular. Constable Lalit Kumar said he joined the force in 1998 and was posted in the Valley for three years.

As soon as his unit returned to the plains, they were sent to Jodhpur as part of the deployment after the December 13 attack on the Parliament, he said. Thereafter, his unit was sent to Gujarat for the rath yatra, and now they were back in the Valley. ""We have had no leave for the past twelve months,"" he said.

The risks may appear minimal for the polling personnel and less so for the CRPF jawan, but they are there nevertheless because terrorists are around and an attack can come with horrific suddenness.

Nothing that the government has on offer can compensate either them or their families for lost lives and limbs.

6,Cong urges Central rule in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: Arguing on the Presidential reference on the Election Commissionâ€™s decision on conducting polls in Gujarat, the Congress stated before the Supreme Court on Tuesday that free and fair polls in the state were possible only under the Presidentâ€™s rule.

Congress counsel Kapil Sibal said: ""Imposition of Presidentâ€™s rule is the only answer to ensure free and fair elections.""

The apex court is dealing with the presidential reference relating to the ECâ€™s decision to hold elections in Gujarat by December and not October 6 â€”the deadline set by the state government.

""The EC has concluded that the constitutional machinery has broken down due to factors enumerated in its report and there can be no free and fair polls,"" he said.

BJP counsel Arun Jaitley had argued that the EC was not empowered to postpone the elections. ""The EC cannot take upon itself the power of deferring the polls,"" Jaitley had said.

However, Sibal said that if elections in an extraordinary situation could not be held within the six-month timeframe, the EC had the power to defer the process beyond this limit.

7,Parapsychologist’s tryst with reincarnation,"ALLAHABAD: Dr Jamuna Prasad and Dr.Ian Stevenson (USA) are the two world-renowned parapsychologists who have pursued the subject of reincarnation, besides being good friends since 1964. But there is a difference in their approach. While Dr. Stevenson has studied innumerable cases of reincarnation all over the world, Dr Prasad, pursuing the subject in India, has been involved in a deeper question of the hows and whys of rebirth. Dr Prasada, 88, told the TNN in an exclusive interview that Dr Stevenson has published a voluminous book on â€˜birth-markâ€™ cases as the reborn child carries some mark or scar of his previous lifeâ€™s injury (murder or killing in most cases). Dr Jamuna Prasad also conducted research on similar lines but experience tells him to probe deeper into the field. Merely studying children who remember past lives and being able to conclude on the basis of verifiable evidence that such and such in this life was such-and-such in his past life, is, what Dr Jamuna Prasad says, a surface research. Dr Jamuna Prasad has, however, outlined an in-depth project on study of children who remember past lives. Under this project, a few well-proven cases will be chosen. One involves Sudha of Kanpur, reborn as Meenoo of Bethar, Unnao. The puzzle was solved and proved beyond doubt that Meenoo was indeed Sudha in her past life. Sudha was murdered by her own husband, a doctor who had fallen in love with his own nurse. Such cases will be studied longitudinally study wherein biographies of both lives will be prepared and analysed to see whether some light is thrown on the play of karma and role of sanskaras or not. Although karma interplay is very subtle and a single life is just too brief to see its full implication, a beginning will have to be made in this direction. Enough evidence has been collected to prove that reincarnation does exist, or as Dr G Murphy put it, the mass of information collected in favour of reincarnation cannot now be brushed aside or proved to the contrary. Parapsychologists therefore, need to take a step forward to search for laws that govern reincarnation, for if the phenomenon exists there must be some laws. It is in this important area of depth research that India can make its own contribution because Indian philosophy has enough material to provide us with the hypothesis needed to start a research project, says Dr Prasad. Stressing the need for depth research in reincarnation, Dr Prasad says, to satisfy the inquisitive mind which has always been clamouring to know about its past and future existence we must be able to tell who or what I was in my past life. This is the type of question often posed to a reincarnation researcher, Prasad says. Some methods have so far been tried. One is the biological approach. Under this method, an anti-forgetfulness hormone is injected into the foetus of a pregnant woman. It is expected that the child thus born will remember its past existence and will tell us about his previous life. But it is a painful process and no pregnant woman has so far dared to offer herself as a volunteer. Another method is that of hypnotic regression which has been tried but with little convincing conclusion. A hypnotically regressed person often tells of a life he lived about 200 years ago or so that can not be verified. Sometimes such a person under hypnotic regression speaks of his identity with a very prominent personality. For example, he may say that he was Moti lal Nehru in his last life. He may be speaking about him on the basis of his study because under regression the person may pick up any thread from his vast unconscious or subconscious mind. Therefore, the method of hypnotic regression is also not fool-proof. The third method is that of spiritual trance through which the past can be visualised. Motoyama, a Japanese Buddhist philosopher, had this power. But any spiritual sadhana is beyond the common man as its prerequisite is pure and honest life.

8,India slips in foreign investment flows: AT Kearney,"NEW DELHI: Even as Finance Minister Jaswant Singh packed his bags for a week-long trip to Washington from Wednesday on a damage control mission aimed at dispelling foreign investorsâ€™ fears about the derailing of Indiaâ€™s reforms process, more damaging news came in on Tuesday.

Global consultancy major AT Kearney released its latest FDI confidence index showing that India had dropped eight spots to the 15th position even as China overtook the US and emerged as the most attractive foreign investment destination in the world. The report said there is a 20 per cent possibility of a decline in FDI inflows into India even if the country maintains a 5 per cent economic growth rate and opens more sectors to foreign investors.

â€˜â€˜The simmering conflict with Pakistan over J&K undoubtedly deters foreign investment on the one hand, while budget deficits and poor infrastructure have further constrained attractiveness on the other,â€™â€™ it said.

Last week, global rating agency Standard and Poorâ€™s downgraded Indiaâ€™s rupee debt rating to â€˜â€˜junk bondsâ€™â€™ status citing similar economic and political factors. A series of economic developments in India, including the Enron crisis, the postponement of the privatisation of two major state-owned oil companies and non-decision on proposals to hike the foreign investment ceilings in sectors such as insurance, aviation and telecom, have sent out only wrong signals to potential investors abroad.

The task is, thus, cut out for the FM, who is going to Washington as head of the Indian delegation, at the annual IMF-World Bank meeting. He will have meetings with his counterparts from the US, the UK, South Africa and Canada, besides the SAARC countries.

Singh will have parleys with the World Bank president and IMF MD. He will also meet officials of the New York Stock Exchange where a number of Indian companies are listed, but have not been doing particularly well of late.

9,Students protest; CPMT counselling cancelled,"LUCKNOW: Counselling for admissions in the medical colleges of the state through Combined Pre-Medical Test (CPMT) was deferred on Tuesday following protests by the candidates, who alleged large-scale anomalies in the results. Medical Education authorities were forced to cancel the counselling done during the last two days because of stiff opposition of students, who also blocked the road for over two hours outside the Rehabilitation and Artificial Limb Centre, the venue of the counselling. Fresh counselling dates will be announced in the first week of October. The incident had brought CPMT-2002 once again under cloud as earlier it was in controversy for delay in declaration of results. Candidates had cast doubts over the allotment of merit due to the delay in the declaration of results on the first day of the counselling on Monday. It happened again on Tuesday. As soon as the counselling started candidates, both girls and boys, assembled outside the venue and started shouting slogans. A few barged into the centre and demanded cancellation of the counselling. They said that many students had applied for â€œscrutinyâ€� of the results. However, while the result of the scrutiny was still awaited, the administration was holding the counselling, they said adding this would mean that they would loose opportunity to join leading medical colleges, whose seats would be allotted first. Director General Medical Education NK Sharma desperately tried to pacify the students saying that â€œscopeâ€� would be left for consideration of the candidates who had applied for scrutiny. However, candidates refused and blocked road in protest. In the meantime, a section of candidates started claiming that there were large-scale anomalies in allotment of merit. They said that neither they were given carbon copies of the answer-sheets, nor were they informed about their marks in the entrance test. They also complained about lack of transparency in the allotment of merit. Some candidates of the other backward class category complained that their merit in the â€˜general list candidatesâ€™ was much higher whereas their names figured much lower in the OBC candidatesâ€™ list. â€œSample this: While in general category a OBC student had 272 rank, in OBC list it was below 500,â€� said a candidate exemplifying his argument. He said that it was impossible that a person is at higher merit in general category and, at the same time, lower in the OBC category. As allegation flew thick and fast and students refused to remove the blockade, the administration was forced to call the police. However, it was only after the DGME announced cancellation of counselling of over 500 candidates done till morning that candidates lifted the blockade.

10,"Scribe's murder: More arrests, weapons seized","LUCKNOW: The Special Task Force and the Gomtinagar police on Tuesday recovered the firearms reportedly used in the murder of Paritosh Pandey along with a prohibited bore revolver from the bank lockers belonging jointly to the already arrested prime accused Jyotiresh Pandey and his mother Pushpa Pandey. On the other hand, the district police nabbed Rakesh Verma whose motorcycle was used in the crime and recovered the vehicle. Pushpa Pandey was also arrested. Senior Superintendent of Police STF Rajiv Ranjan Verma said that tracing the movements of Pushpa Pandey all through Tuesday since morning itself, it was found that she had visited the Hazratganj branch of the Central Bank and then the Naka branch of the same bank. An employee of the Central Bank itself, Pushpa also went to visit some one in Lal Kuan area in between her visits to the two banks. Later police detained Pushpa and quizzed her at length. The police then opened the locker (number 362) at the Naka branch in the presence of senior officials of the bank and public witnesses and recovered a Star pistol (7.62 bore) along with a magazine and 11 cartridges. A Ruger brand 38 bore revolver with 28 live cartridges and 7 shells, seven cartridges of 12 bore and another 2 of 32 bore were recovered from the locker, apart from other things. SSP Lucknow Anil Kumar Agarwal said that Rakesh was nabbed by the Gomtinagar police and his motorcycle was recovered. The vehicle was used in the commission of crime and Rakesh had admitted this much of his role. SP trans-Gomti Satyendra Veer Singh, who headed the operation from the district police end, said that the Hazratganj branch locker was operated at 11 am while the one at Naka branch was operated at 11:40 am by Pushpa Pandey according to the signatures on the record books of the locker section at the bank. The two lockers are in the name of Pushpa Pandey and her son Jyotiresh Pandey alias Anna. It was being verified if she had shifted the firearms and ammunition from one locker to another or had brought the firearms from somewhere in Lal Kuan, the locality which she visited during the 40 minute period between operation of the two lockers. SP STF Anant Deo confirmed that 7.62 bore was used in the murder of journalist Paritosh Pandey and that a same bore pistol was recovered from the bank locker. He said that the seized revolver was a service weapon apparently belonging to a police personal. It was yet to be verified as whom the revolver belonged to.

11,VHP calls nation-wide bandh on Thursday,"KANPUR/NEW DELHI: VHP chief Ashok Singhal has called for a nationwide bandh on Thursday in protest against the terrorist attack in Akshardham, even as the RSS urged the people of Gujarat to maintain peace and not to fall prey to the designs of anti-national terrorists. ""The VHP and Bajrang Dal have decided to observe Bharat bandh against the attack. Only health services would be exempted from the purview of the bandh,"" VHP secretary and in-charge of Bajrang Dal Surendra Jain told reporters in the Capital over phone from Rohtak. Singhal said in Kanpur that the Gandhinagar temple attack was ""more serious"" an incident than Godhra carnage and that such actions would recur if timely measures were not taken. Jain said ""pseudo-secularists who attack the Sangh Parivar instead of jehadi terrorists with a view to appease the Muslims"" were responsible for the incident. VHP central secretary Veereshwar Dwivedi said: ""The attack is an onslaught on the sovereignty of the Indian nation and all nationalists should rise to the occasion and crush such activities."" Condemning the attack as ""reprehensible"", RSS joint spokesman Ram Madhav said, ""we see a sinister motive behind this attack. It is aimed at disturbing peace and harmony. It is an attempt to flare up communal passions.""

12,AAI flouts rules in Rs 50 crore X-ray contract,"NEW DELHI: A controversy seems to be brewing in the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The authority has been accused of flouting global tendering norms while awarding a Rs 50 crore X-ray machine contract to a German firm â€” Heimann Systems.

AAI had, on July 19 and 30, 2002, invited commercial and technical bids from prospective suppliers of 220 colour X-ray Baggage Inspection Systems (XBIS). Technical evaluation of the machines was fixed for July 30 and 31.

As per the global tendering process, the AAI needed to make the results of this exercise public and sought authentication of the results from individual manufacturers. However, the authority had allegedly not intimated the bidders about the outcome of the evaluation. Instead, it opened the commercial bid for only a single bidder â€” Heimann â€” and awarded the contract to the firm, sources said.

AAI officials refuted the charges saying the entire exercise was transparent and conducted by three independent committees. â€œThese controversies are being raised by ECIL just because its bid has been rejected. The machines they supplied were not up to the defined standards and were thus rejected...We had set up three different committees for performance testing, technical evaluation and for finalising the report. Thereâ€™s no way the norms could be flouted with this deal.â€�

Meanwhile, former Bureau of Civil Aviation Security commissioner has been accused of announcing that the government would buy around 200 Heimann X-ray machines, to be installed at 20 sensitive airports, prior to submission of tender bids and technical evaluation. Sources pointed out that senior officials of the ministry of civil aviation have already been apprised of the matter. One of the bidders â€” ECIL-Rapiscan â€” have also protested against the award of the contract and sought immediate intervention by the ministry to cancel the order.

â€œWe are using ECILâ€™s machines. But they have not been able to keep pace with the technological advancements,â€� the officials said.

13,"Over 700 powermen protest JSEB decision, strike work","PATNA/RANCHI: More than 700 power workers of Jharkhand have gone on an indefinite strike from Tuesday morning in protest against the decision of the Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) to abolish the posts of meter readers and bill clerks.

The JSEB has made alternative arrangement to maintain uninterrupted power supply in Jharkhand. Superintending engineers have been asked to recruit workers at the local level.

The JSEB has given ultimatum to the power workers to resume duty within 72 hours, otherwise they would be dismissed. The energy minister Lal Chand Mahto said that there was no impact of the strike in the state.

Power workers claimed that the strike is complete in Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Hazaribag, Dhanbad and Deoghar.

The power supply in different parts of the state including Ranchi has not been affected in view of the strike. The JSEB is getting surplus power from different sectors. Ranchi and its neighbouring areas are getting normal demand of 180 MW of power. A round-the-clock control room has been set up at the JSEB office to monitor the power supply in the state.

The technical staff including engineers have not gone on strike.

Earlier, a delegation of Jharkhand Power Workers Union led by its president Baikunth Nandan Singh met the chairman of the JSEB Rajib Ranjan at his office in support of their eight-point charter of demands. Besides, the chairman member (technical), IG vigilance and the director, personnel were also present at the meeting.

When contacted, JSEB chairman Ranjan said, â€œwe have already conceded their seven demandsâ€�. Their demands for the payment of salary arrears have been conceded. The board has decided to make payment of the consolidated amount of Rs 5,000 to the workers and Rs 10,000 to the officials till the final adjustment is made with the Bihar government. The part of the arrear amount will also be paid by the end of December-January on the basis of their performance.

The JSEB has also agreed to make payment of 15 per cent house rent allowance (HRA) to employees working in class B cities like Dhanbad. As regards to the payment of retirement benefits to the employees, the JSEB has agreed to give all its benefits within six months of retirement.

The demands related to the re-employment of three dismissed staff and the upgradation of rank of employees joined on the basis of compensation will also be looked into through a separate committee.

A large number of power consumers living in different localities of Ranchi complained that there was no prevalent practice of meter checking at their respective residences. In order to improve the system, the JSEB has decided to privatise posts like meter readers and bill clerks. These posts have been abolished with effect from March 31, 2002.

The employees engaged in the work of meter reading and bill clerks would be adjusted in other departments. After adjusting them in other departments, there will still be 30 per cent posts which will be vacant, claimed an official.

14,Jharkhand bandh total and peaceful,"RANCHI: Stringent measures by the police and administration went a long way on Tuesday to ensure that the Jharkhand bandh called by the Jharkhand Disom Party headed by BJP MP Salkhaan Murmu passed off peacefully all over the state.

Barring a few stray incidents of stone pelting and arson, no untoward incident was reported from anywhere in the state, though the bandh was by and large total.

One of the main factors behind the peaceful bandh was the arrest of Murmu, who was camping in Jamshedpur, this morning. According to DGP R R Prasad, the Jamshedpur police arrested 183 bandh supporters, including the MP, while in Ranchi 122 people were held. Five bandh protagonists were arrested in Dumka.

Murmu had called the bandh in protest against the Jharkhand High Courtâ€™sverdict limiting the reservation quota to 50 per cent against 73 per cent stipulated by the government.

In the state capital, shopkeepers and businessmen downed shutters apprehending violence though bandh protagonists were not seen on the streets in the face of heavy deployment of police.

Educational institutions, automated teller machines (ATMs) and branches of some banks situated in sensitive areas were also closed.

Though private vehicles were largely off the roads, there was no disruption of rail traffic. Bandh supporters, however, resorted to stone pelting at Lowadih and Dibdih localities. Miscreants also set afire a truck on the Hermu bypass road late on Monday night.

While the bandh call had not received support from any political party, the Adivasi and Moolvasi Sanghs had supported it.

Their leaders had gone underground following imposition of prohibitory orders and heavy deployment of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) CRPF, Jharkhand Armed Police and district police.

According to a report from Hazaribag, the bandh call had no effect in the district.

All educational institutions, commercial organisations and government offices functioned normally. Production in collieries and other industrial units of the district was normal. However, the bandh had some effect on the running of long-distance bus services and commercial vehicles on the Ranchi-Patna National Highway and the G T Road.

15,Irate farmers ransack Thorrur sub-station,"WARANGAL: Unable to get uninterrupted power supplies for the assured nine hours a day, irate farmers raided the electricity substation in Thorrur mandal headquarters of Warangal district on Tuesday.

About 5,000 farmers from the surrounding villages stormed the sub-station office premises and damaged the furniture. It may be recalled that farmers in the region were complaining of frequent load shedding in the peak hours and hundreds of pumpsets, including transformers were burnt due to the power fluctuations.

The farmers, on Tuesday, led by Congress district president Gandra Venkataramana Reddy, Congress floor leader in zilla parishad Praveen Rao and other opposition groups went to the office and sought the officials to rectify the power supply pattern immediately.

As the officials and employees expressed their inability to rectify the supply pattern, the farmers went berserk and damaged the furniture in the office.

Later, the farmers observed a road blockade in the Thorrur mandals headquarters. Elsewhere in the district, farmers observed a protest day Meanwhile, acccording to a report from Vijayawada, activists of the Congress party and Youth Congress held a dharna in front of the AP Transco superintending engineers office here on Tuesday in protest against power cuts. Pradesh Congress Committee secretary Malladi Vishnu led the agitation.

Addressing the protestors, Vishnu criticised the state government for going back on its promise of quality and uninterrupted power supply. Lack of planning on part of the government resulted in the current crisis, he pointed out. Vishnu alleged that power was not being supplied for nine hours to farmers in the district despite tall promises by the government.

He criticised Transco for imposing power cuts even during nights. Vishnu wanted the government to take immediate steps to mitigate the power crisis. Later, a memorandum was submitted to the Transco superintending engineer.

16,Nagarjunasagar farmers to be paid for crop loss,"HYDERABAD: In a rare gesture, the state government has, in principle, decided to compensate farmers under the Nagarjunasagar project ayacut facing the threat of total crop loss due to non-availability of water.

Major irrigation minister Kadiam Srihari at a press conference on Tuesday admitted that the government had miscalculated the availability of water under the Nagarjunasagar project prior to releasing it for irrigation. This plunged the adversely affected farmers â€” who had taken up sowing in about 50,000 acres following the governmentâ€™s assurance â€” into a crisis.

â€œOur calculations about the availability of water in Nagarjunasagar went wrong and hence, we have decided to compensate farmers under the project who undertook sowing after September 1,â€™â€™ Srihari said, adding the government has asked officials concerned to prepare distributory committee-wise details of crop transplantation under Nagarjunasagar to work out modalities for payment of compensation.

Srihari, however, clarified that the government took a decision to release the water only after consulting political parties, distributory committees,local representatives and others concerned. And, the decision to stop water was also taken after consulting all the sections concerned. â€œThere are no politics involved in this and the government did not act under any pressure,â€™â€™ the minister asserted.

Srihari explained that the government took the decision to release water into Nagarjunasagar ayacut after carefully considering the experiences of the past few decades: that the state would receive good rainfall in September and October.

However, the expectations did not materialise and for the first time in the last 50 years, Nagarjunasagar did not get a single tmc of water in September. â€œHad the expectations gone right, people would have appreciated us for taking a dynamic decision at the right time,â€™â€™ he said.

Srihari also took strong exception to CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddyâ€™s criticism of the government and said political parties, including the Congress, should not utilise the situation for political gains. They could instead give constructive suggestions to mitigate the hardship faced by the people.

Following this, MRPS activists indulged in violence by setting ablaze government offices and RTC buses. Krishna refused medical attention till June 7, due to which his condition deteriorated.

The doctors opined that Krishna needs to be shifted to hospital for treatment. When the police came to the place where fast was being undertaken, MRPS activists pelted stones and kerosene bombs. Krishna was arrested and shifted to NIMS. The Gandhinagar police later booked a case against MRPS activists for attempt to murder and rioting.

18,Attack on temple to disrupt J&K polls: Advani,"GANDHINAGAR: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Wednesday said that the terrorists targeted the Swaminarayan temple as their design to disrupt Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir had failed.

""The only reason I think for the attack is that the defeat of the terrorist designs in Jammu and Kashmir led them to target a holy and sacred place where hundreds of innocent devotees had gathered,"" he told reporters after visiting the temple complex on Wednesday morning shortly after the two terrorists were killed in an NSG commando operation.

Advani said that apparently the terrorists wanted to hold some of the trapped devotees hostage in a bid to make a bargain with authorities and expressed relief that their possible aims had been thwarted.

Maintaining that about 28 people had been killed, he said that timely action by the security forces prevented any damage to the temple.

Asked as to why the terrorists chose to attack the temple in Gujarat, Advani said ""I believe there could be several reasons. Our enemy had even referred to the Gujarat issue at the United Nations. Investigations are on to find out the details about Tehreek-e-Qisas, leaflets of which were found from the slain terrorists.""

Advani said that the terrorists had targeted the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Parliament House, Raghunath Temple and Kaluchak in Jammu, and added that the latest attack on Swaminarayan temple had been planned for quite some time.

""It is a continuing war in which there are battle after battle,"" he said, adding New Delhi had to wage a war against terrorists.

Advani said that the terrorists were perhaps perturbed over the fact that democracy in India would be further strengthened after the successful and peaceful elections in Jammu and Kashmir, which would take country''s position at a higher pedestal at the international arena.

Advani said that terrorists had tried to disrupt the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly election process by killing candidates, campaigners and party workers and described it as an attack on democracy.

""What else can be the reason behind this incident and what explanation can they give for it,"" he said.

Lauding the role of state police and the NSG commandos for their swift action, Advani said that a message had gone across the country that India had scored a spectacular victory in the proxy war.

He, however, said that still there was need for caution and for maintaining calm.

21,Advani to meet ministers over VSNL issue,"MUMBAI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie, Union Finance Minister Jaswant Singh and Union Communications Minister Pramod Mahajan would again meet on October 5 in a bid to resolve the imbroglio over sharing of international traffic by Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and other telecom PSUs.

""We had an hour-long meeting on Tuesday, which remained inconclusive and in addition, it was also interrupted due to the Gandhinagar incident, so the ministers have decided to meet again on October 5,"" Mahajan told newspersons after inaugurating a two-day NASSCOM-Gartner Summit 2002 here on Wednesday.

The interconnect lines between VSNL, BSNL and MTNL would not be cut on October 1. There has been no interconnect agreement between these entities since April 1 this year and they were also not getting any money, he said.

Mahajan had set October 1 as a deadline for VSNL to come up with a fresh proposal for interconnect with BSNL as the former would have to match the terms offered by other international carriers like Bharti.

The minister said if the concerned parties come to a conclusion before the proposed meeting, the same would be considered by the ministry.

22,"All except NC, BJP welcome in next govt: Azad","JAMMU: State Congress chief Ghulam Nabi Azad has said that his party was not averse to forming the next government with the help of other parties barring the ruling National Conference (NC) and the BJP.

``Other than the BJP and the NC, the Congress is open to joining hands with all others and everybody is welcome aboard,â€™â€™ he said in an exclusive interview here on Wednesday.

He was replying to a question on whether the Congress would join hands with the People''s Democratic Party (PDP) of former Union home minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and other parties to form the next government.

The way things stand now, with poll pundits predicting a hung Assembly and no pre-poll alliance or party likely to win a clear majority in the state Assembly, it is likely that the next state government would be a coalition government.

Post-poll, parties like the NC, the BJP and the BSP would form one block and the Congress, the PDP and independents (proxy candidates of People''s Conference) another, according to political observers.

In this context, Mufti has already made it clear that his party is ready and willing to join hands with other parties to boot out NC from power.

Asked whether he was a claimant for the chief minister''s post if the Congress formed the next government, Azad said that he had consistently taken a line that the party should not project any individuals for such posts.

He conveniently failed to mention that in the neighbouring Punjab Assembly elections earlier this year, Amarinder Singh was projected by the party as its chief ministerial candidate.

In reply to another question, Azad candidly admitted that he was not very keen on becoming the state party chief. He explained that his reluctance sprang from the fact that he was asked to undertake the assignment very late.

``I would have been happier to take up this assignment two years ago when I would have got more time to turn the party around in the state. In that case, we (the Congress) could have won as many as 60 seats,â€™â€™ he claimed.

Asked how he managed to stay close to successive Congress chiefs, including Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P V Narasimha Rao and now Sonia Gandhi, Azad said that it was his dedication to work which was dear to all of them.

``I work 20 hours a day and they all liked my work. It is my work which gives me proximity to the leaders,â€™â€™ he said.

Azad denied that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi''s rallies in Srinagar and Jammu were flops. He then went on to blast Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah and senior BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, for failing to visit the state during the elections.

``Both Vajpayee and Advani mention Jammu and Kashmir in their speeches day in and day out but none of them had the guts to visit the state for campaigning,â€™â€™ he said.

Claiming that over 10,000 people had attended Soniaâ€™s rally at Srinagar some days ago, he said that the CM and his son Omar Abdullah had not dared to hold a single rally on the same ground.

``The CM herded people from Jammu region to Srinagar when he anointed his son as his successor some months ago,â€™â€™ Azad said.

Accusing the Farooq-Omar duo of putting their personal interests above all else, he said that the Congress always put national interest uppermost.

Azad said that the Congress would accord top priority to solving the Kashmir problem through ``unconditional dialogue with all parties, including separatists, within the parameters of the Indian Constitutionâ€™â€™.

Asked whether the party had a readymade blueprint for resolving the problem, he said that the Congress was a very seasoned party and had solved insurgency problems in several states like Mizoram, Assam, Punjab, etc, in the past, even when it had to give up power in most of the states to solve the problems.

Maybe the problem would be solved if the NC gave up power just as the Congress had done in 1975 to bring the former into the mainstream, he said, adding this was one price Farooq and Omar were not willing to pay.

24,GAIL seeks govt nod to sell LPG,"NEW DELHI: Gas transmission company GAIL has sought government nod for marketing Liquefied Petroleum Gas to domestic consumers and retail auto-LPG in eight cities.

""We have sought Government permission to begin marketing of LPG to domestic, industrial and automobile sectors,"" GAIL Chairman and Managing Director Prashanto Banerjee told a news conference here.

GAIL, which produces about 1 million tonnes of LPG annually, would market auto-LPG through a retail chain in 8-cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Kanpur and Agra.

At present, only imported LPG is permitted as auto fuel. ""Since we produce high quality of LPG directly from natural gas, we have asked Government to allow us to retail it,"" he said.

The company, which changed its name from Gas Authority of India to GAIL (India) to reflect diversification of business interests, was also interested in marketing domestic cooking gas to consumers while also seeking bulk industrial consumers.

""Unlike private sector LPG vendor companies, we see no problem in selling domestic cooking gas to household consumers as GAIL being a PSU would be entitled for the subsidy from the budget,"" Banerjee said.

Exploration firm Oil and Natural Gas Corporation too has approached Government for nod to sell LPG.

When contacted Petroleum Minister Ram Naik said ""I have yet to see the applications of the two companies. A decision (on the applications) would be taken in due course.""

25,Rohinton Mistry inches closer to Booker,"LONDON: For the third time, Canada-based Indian writer Rohinton Mistry has arrived on Britainâ€™s prestigious Booker Prize shortlist, but all the worldâ€™s attention is focused on a great literary churning across the Commonwealth, which has forced Booker judges to pronounce a remarkable fatwa on ""pompous fiction"".

Mistry, one of three fellow-Canadians on the shortlist, may be hoping to be third time lucky, even though Family Matters , his ""big, big-hearted tale"" about an elderly Parsi gentleman in Mumbai has been commended but won few ecstatic reviews.

But the biggest story of the Booker Prize, long a symbol of quality writing, is the new literary fatwa and the judgesâ€™ appeal for ""fun, readable fiction"".

The award, now worth more than twice as much as when Arundhati Roy won its Â£20,000 prize money in 1997, is threatening to expand its empire and throw the field open to writers from beyond the Commonwealth.

The planned expansion, possibly due by 2004, is expected to make it harder all around, not least for India, which has not had a win since Royâ€™s The God of Small Things.

The Prize, with a new sponsor and a new name, the Man Booker, has courted controversy by failing to shortlist for the second year running Britainâ€™s best-selling young multi-cultural chronicler, Zadie Smith.

Instead, the 2002 shortlist includes Mistryâ€™s fellow-Canadians Yann Martel and Carol Shields, apart from William Trevor, Sarah Waters and Tim Winton.

In a statement, the judges commended ""The strong showing of Commonwealth writers"", which they said showed ""the real importance of the Prize''s criteria for entry"".",LONDON

28,Power theft law to be enforced from Oct 1,"PUNE: Come October and power thieves wonâ€™t have it easy. The ordinance that makes electricity theft a cognisable and non-bailable offence will come into force in the state from October 1.

Any theft detected by the vigilance squads of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) from next month onwards will attract a jail sentence and fine as per the new provisions. This was disclosed by Ramesh Tandale, deputy director (vigilance), while speaking to TNN here on Tuesday.

A month-long awareness drive will be undertaken by the vigilance department to ensure that people realise the gravity of the offence and the punishments lined up in the ordinance, which was signed by the governor, recently. It may be noted here that the state cabinet had approved the bill last month.

Tandale said people indulging in power thefts would be given a monthâ€™s time to contact the vigilance department to regularise their connections. â€œThey will, of course, have to pay the stipulated fine and theft dues assessed by officials,â€� Tandale said, adding that after that no such concession would be given to the culprits under any circumstances.

In Maharashtra, Tandale felt that the MSEBâ€™s annual revenue could increase by as much as Rs 1,000 crore if the state government extended similar support to the vigilance department while enforcing the new provisions. Tandale is confident that the ordinance will have a positive effect, particularly because of the provisions regarding a special court and district tribunals to deal with power theft cases.

â€œThe police will have to file a chargesheet within a month once a theft cased is registered and the court will have to decide the case in six months,â€� he said. â€œIf the culprit is ready to pay all the dues to the MSEB after we file the first information report (FIR),we can withdraw it. How-ever, he will first have to pay half of the theft amount besides a compounding fee of Rs 2,000 per KW of sanctioned load to the government treasury before we allow withdrawal of the FIR,â€� he explained.

The new provisions stipulate a minimum of three months and a maximum of three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5,000 to Rs 50,000.

29,Govt rules out law for pre-marital HIV tests,"PUNE: The Maharashtra government has categorically ruled out mandatory HIV tests before marriage in the state, saying that it would only add to the social and ethical problems associated with Aids.

State health minister Digvijay Khanvilkar pleaded ignorance about the recent announcement by his Andhra Pradesh (AP) counterpart of introducing a legislation to make such a test mandatory for all people of marriageable age in AP.

Khanvilkar said such a test would amount to a violation of the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) guidelines. â€œThe Naco guidelines do not allow forcible testing,â€� he said. Goa is the only state in the country which has made HIV tests before marriage compulsory.

While Maharashtra figures among the top three states in India with about 1.5 to 2 per cent of the adult population falling prey to the disease, mainly due to their sexual behaviour, Khanvilkar said the state government would concentrate on voluntary counselling and testing.

Andhra health minister K. Siva Prasad Rao was quoted by the media last week about the proposed legislation in the coming session of the state assembly. Rao had justified the decision, saying that the state has four lakh HIV positive cases, out of which half of the victims are in the marriageable age.

Elaborating the problems anticipated with mandatory testing, the health minister said such an act does not guarantee that the disease would be confined to only the high risk behavioural groups. â€œThe virus has already spread to the general population,â€� he said, also pointing out to the window period where the virus may not be detected despite the person undergoing a test.

Meanwhile, secretary of the medical education, G.S. Gill, said that apart from the social and ethical problems, the government cannot afford to annoy the funding agencies, both the Centre and the World Bank, which has funded a whopping Rs 110 crore under the second phase of its Aids project, particularly in Mumbai.

Aids experts Sanjay Pujari and Vinay Kulkarni said efforts should be made to popularise voluntary testing on a case-to-case basis. â€œNo doubt, the women populace are at a high risk as the virus is mainly spread by the male population, but then in India, getting a false certificate is no big deal,â€� said Pujari. Kulkarni said that an HIV test needs a lot of counselling and infrastructure.
