2,Advani wants Central law to curb terrorism,"new delhi: the home ministry is keen to bring in a central law to deal with crimes from across borders like terrorism, drug trafficking and killings which states find difficult to tackle them. home minister advani admitted on monday that this was ``the right time'' to bring in a law on the lines of the the us to enable the central agencies to deal with such crimes more effectively. however, he said that the law would be enacted only after getting consents from all the states. ``we will be soon discussing about this with all the state governments and only with their cooperation, such a law will be brought about,'' advani said. advani said, ``in the past three-and-a-half years we have got good cooperation from all the states in dealing with such crimes'' which are aimed at destabilising the state, he said. a chief ministers' conference in this regard is also due in november. in view of the heightened tension across the world and the subcontinent following the terrorist strikes in the us, the home minister said there was a ``need for greater sense of vigilance in the administration, in the government and in the public.'' he said india was not bargaining with the us or any country for its assistance in return. ``we are with anybody fighting against terrorism,'' he said. however, advani added that the us must ban organisations like lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammad. both these organisations have had links with the al-quaida of osama-bin-ladin in afghanistan, he said. according to information available here the us state department has two lists of terrorists ^ one contains those which are banned and the other which may be banned. among those which have not been banned as yet in the us are the ira, the ltte, the lashkar-e-taiba, the jaish-e-mohammad and many others. al-qaida is in the banned list. the home minister clarified that he had not spoken about any general amnesty to punjab police officers facing charges of alleged excesses during counter terrorism in punjab. advani, however, insisted that the government was still considering some legal measures by which police officers whose actions were not malafide but bonafide while discharging their duty could be protected from unnecessary legal persecution. this recommendation is also included in the gom report.

3,SC verdict backs govt in curbing ragging,"bangalore: the karnataka government has yet again issued a circular prohibiting ragging in educational institutions and hostels. the circular, which comes at a time when engineering and medical colleges are all set to reopen, is not too different from what was issued last year. the welcome change is: a supreme court verdict backs it. while expressing its anguish about ragging crossing the limits of decency, morality and humanity, the supreme court said it cannot be eradicated only by making it a cognisable criminal and punishable offence. the accountability of teachers for the purpose of discipline should be restored and the responsibilities fixed, the verdict said. taking note of the supreme court order, the government circular has emphasised the need to create awareness among students that ragging is a reprehensible act. institutions should generate an atmosphere of discipline through a clear message that no act of ragging would be tolerated, the circular said. it has also enlisted the punishment that a student would be subjected to if he/she is found guilty besides asked institutions to form committees to ensure that incidents of ragging do not occur. it is ironical that ragging of juniors by seniors continues to occur in educational institutions despite such circulars. last month, a case was registered following complaints of a ii year bds student being ragged by his seniors at m.s. ramaiah college. such incidents prove that merely issuing circulars does not prevent ragging. what is needed is a more pro-active approach by the education department and the educational institutions. this can include surprise visits by the department and college representatives to hostels and canteens where such incidents normally occur.

6,Cabinet drops outdated laws,"new delhi: following the recommendations of the commission on review of administrative laws, the government decided on monday to delete from the statute book two outdated pieces of legislation. the first is an ordinance providing for emergency powers to maintain essential services during the world war ii period, and the other the refugee relief taxation (abolition) act, 1973. the union cabinet approved the introduction of two repeal bills for this purpose in parliament, official sources said. the essential services (maintenance) ordinance, 1941, came into force during the british period. as it had no time limit, it continued to be on the statute book though it had outlived its utility, sources said, clarifying it had nothing to do with the essential services maintenance act (esma), which was extended from time to time. the refugee relief taxation (abolition) act, 1973, enacted to abolish refugee relief taxes imposed under various central legislations, also had provisions with regard to refunds and other matters. since this act had served its purpose and had since become obsolete, it was decided to repeal it as well. official sources said a commission on review of administrative laws was constituted by the department of administrative reforms in may 1998, under the chairmanship of p c jain. this commission submitted its report in september 1998, and made certain recommendations regarding amendment or repeal of various acts. under this, the commission had identified 166 acts.
