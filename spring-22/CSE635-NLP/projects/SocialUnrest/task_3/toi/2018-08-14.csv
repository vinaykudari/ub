2,"Jaya rules out central probe, blames DMK","chennai: tamil nadu chief minister j jayalalitha, insisting that the dmk rallyists were responsible for the sunday violence, denied on tuesday if her party had to do anything with the incident which has claimed six lives so far. talking to the media on tuesday afternoon after briefing governor c rangarajan at raj bhavan for 50 minutes, jayalalitha said the incident had occured as dmk chief m karunanidhi had wanted a few people to be killed. ""it was the dmk which was bent upon creating violence. the dmk had employed some mercenaries for the same,"" she contended and added that the attack of rallysts on some fishermen in ayodhyakuppam had instigated the violence. she ruled out any separate judicial probe by the centre as demanded by the dmk saying it was unnecessary. ""there can not be a parallel commission of inquiry as the state government has already set up a judicial probe,"" she pointed out. the state government has submitted the basic information to the governor on which basis the latter would submit his report, she said, adding her government has also sent its report on the violence to the union home ministry. the reports to the centre and the governor have been supported by newspaper and video clippings. asked if the governor was satisfied with the government reports, she said there was no question of satisfaction or dissatisfaction by the governor. meanwhile, responding to jayalalithaa's comment that a judicial probe by the centre was unneccesary, karunanidhi continued to demand a comprehensive probe by the centre on the atrocities perpetrated by the police. talking to newspersons here karunanidhi said: ""what we want is a comprehensive probe by the centre on the atrocities of police in the aiadmk government. we do not want a state government probe."" denying jayalalitha's charges that the dmk had hired mercenaries to foment trouble, karunanidhi further pointed out that it was the police who had hired the goons to instigate the violence. he even circulated a photograph of an sp seen talking to some miscreants.

3,'Genetically modified foods are here',"new delhi: with increasing population on the planet, the focus of agricultural scientists is now on enhancing food production at a pace which would meet the future needs of the population. the rapid advances in biotechnology have come in handy for their efforts in this direction. to put it simply, a transgenic or genetically modified crop is developed by introducing a change in the genetic structure in the plants of the crop. this change would produce certain desirable ""traits"" in the crop and in the yield. these traits can be pest-resistance or disease-resistance, changes in appearance and also enhanced yield of the crop. many scientists like the nobel peace prize winner norman borlaug have been advocating development of genetically modified crops and their use by farmers. but of late, there's been strong opposition from environmentalists all over the world, to the genetic alteration of crops and their consumption. the debate picked up momentum when the us department of agriculture and the delta & pine land co. collaborated in march 1998 to support research on the development of new seeds by the rural advancement foundation international. the research was on the development of a new seed technology called terminator. a patent was obtained that could be applied to all seeds and plants of all species including both transgenic and conventionally-bred seeds. this technology threatened to put on end to the age-old practice in which farmers saved their seeds for use in the next harvest season. with terminator seeds, crops would become sterile and farmers would have to buy seeds every year for farming. after a lot of protests, this project was finally shelved. another such creation was the new leaf superior variety of potatoes marketed by monsanto corporation. these potatoes had pest-fighting capabilities. genetically modified with bacillus thuringienisis (bt), they could kill the colorado beetle, one of the biggest threats to healthy potatoes. another dimension to the issue of biogenetic foods is administering vaccines through vegetables and fruits. genetic engineers have mooted a plan for creating `edible vaccines' by introducing them in various fruits and vegetables against diseases like hepatitis, cholera and malaria. of course, there is little evidence to show that these genetically modified foods are harmful for consumption. no one knows the long-term effects of these biotech foods. so, there is a lot of scepticism. but, despite the concern about the spreading of these crops, it has become impossible to control this spread. a good example of genetic modification is the starlink corn, a bio-engineered corn variety that contains bt insecticide proteins (cry 9c protein). it was developed for control of the european corn borer and the southeast corn borer and for suppression of the black cut worm and the corn stalk borer. on an application from aventis crop science (aventis), this corn variety was approved for animal feed and industrial uses, in the us by the us environment protection agency, in may 1998. however, the agency hesitated to give full approval for its use as human food. this was based on the potential allergic nature of the cry 9c protein. aventis did not seek regulatory approval outside the us because the company did not intend to market this corn internationally. however, as a result of the breakdown of the channelising system in the us, that segregates distribution of animal feed from human feed, starlink corn entered the human food supply chain. there were extensive food recalls. following a positive detection of this variety in a product by a japanese consumer group, japan's health ministry requested the us to curb exports of this corn. according to greenpeace, many bio-tech products are being exported to asian and african countries with the aim of experimenting their effects on the third world population. the potential danger of genetic modification is that a particular country can play havoc with another country's agricultural system by introducing some modification in the crops which may spread diseases. of course, this speculation would not go down with some people, but this possibility cannot be ruled out. in this field of biotechnology, it is easy to contaminate the food chain by introducing genetic changes in some seeds or crops. since the change may not affect the physical appearance, it is all the more difficult to identify the change. the government must therefore come out with a coherent policy to stop the entry of genetically modified foods in to the market. it should also advocate use of alternative methods of crop production.",new delhi

5,Vokkaliga rally gives Lakshmi's case a political turn,"mysore: the death of lakshmi, a 12 year old housemaid, and the incidents following it are slowly taking on a political hue, with the local vokkaliga organisations taking out a procession in support of the city police and trying to make it a community issue. members of organisations such as vokkaligara hita rakshana samiti, sarvodaya yuvaka sangha and vokkaliga jagrutha vedike, who took out a procession on tuesday defended police action and stood solidly behind the city police commissioner. leaders of these organisations, who addressed members at the deputy commissioner's office before submitting a memorandum, said the organisations which have taken up the lakshmi issue are trying to tarnish the image of police commissioner chandrashekar, who belongs to the vokkaliga community. the leaders, apart from criticising ngos working against child labour and sex workers in the city, also lambasted writer ramdas and used choice epithets against him. ""ngo leaders and ramdas are intolerant of chandrashekar's good work in the city and have taken up the lakshmi issue to get him transferred,"" the leaders alleged. they said these elements were behind the protest march organised by the ngos against the police on august 7. bjp mla shankerlingegowda, who also addressed the youth at krishnarajendra circle, gave a clean chit to the police officers. though the organisers denied they were being instigated to take out the march in support of the police, it is rumoured that officers responsible for beating up the ngo leaders and ramdas have propped up the local vokkaliga youth to organise the march. however, the ngos and former mayor narayan, who was also beaten up by the police on august 7 when they took lakshmi's body in a procession demanding action against the house owner, denied they had anything against any individual police officer in the city. lakshmi's employer is a close relative of a city police officer and an influential person. ""we are concerned about action against people responsible for the death of lakshmi and arrest of the culprits, besides suitable financial relief to lakshmi's stepmother under whose care the former was left after the death of her parents,"" narayan said, clarifying that they had never demanded the transfer of the city police commissioner. ""we only demanded action against the police officers who roughed up ngo leaders and writer ramdas."" ""politicising and giving a communal colour to lakshmi's death and the incidents following it should be condemned,"" he added.

6,Ganesha to the aid of drought-hit farmers,"mysore: just when a farmer and his family members __ frustrated over crop failure due to the drought __ attempt suicide, ganesha comes to their rescue. no, neither the elephant god was sighted, nor did he come to their aid. this is the theme the idol makers of mysore are exploiting to the hilt for ganesh chathurthi, just a week away. the lord, of course, also supplies water __ through his trunk __ to farmers. ``we have not adopted the concept just to boost sale. we believe it is our prayer to lord ganesha to provide adequate rains to farmers,'' says ramaiah, a leading idol maker. among the favourite theme is the famed kbc hosted by amitabh bachchan.``last year, the market was bad due to kidnapping of kannada matinee idol rajkumar by forest brigand veerappan,'' says ramaiah. the plan to employ `kidnap drama' as the theme last year failed as many organisations decided against celebrations as a mark of respect to the veteran actor. idols of sachin tendulkar with his cricket bat, bachchan on the `hot seat', rajkumar seeking blessings from lord ganesha, vajpayee-musharraf blessed by ganesha during talks, and the lord pacifying karunanidhi and jayalalitha are some of the popular themes this year. ``we have not kept idols of celebrities and politicians for sale. it is only to attract customers and to highlight our artistic skills,'' said shivanand, another idol maker. agreeing that the sale of idols is better than last year, he said the festival would be celebrated on a large scale this year. voluntary organisations have booked over 150 ganesha idols measuring more than 12 ft in height, he said.

7,"JSEB has two members (admn), thanks to govt's faux pas","ranchi: a personnel department notification, promoting labour commissioner arvind kumar sinha as member (administration) of the jharkhand state electricity board, has created a peculiar crisis in the government circles here. the crisis arises from the fact that board chairman rajib ranjan was also appointed as member (administration) before he was made the chairman of the state electricity board. for, according to norms, only a member of the board can be appointed as the chairman. though no letter removing ranjan from his post has been issued, the fact remains there cannot exist two members (administration) in the board at one time. state chief secretary v s dubey told the times of india that this was simply a faux pas and would be suitably amended by the energy department which has to issue the notification finally. dubey said if sinha has been appointed member (administration), ranjan would be appointed member (finance) or vice versa. the notification, however, in no sense meant that this was a ploy for the removal of the existing chairman, said the chief secretary. the speculations about ranjan's removal following the notification can be attributed to the fact that the chairman and the energy minister have not been on the best of terms for the past couple of months. energy minister lalchand mahato has even accused ranjan of inefficiency. mahato's initial move to appoint h b lal as the jseb chairman is now pending in the jharkhand high court. meanwhile, monday's transfers and postings are being seen as a major victory for the alliance ministers in the babulal marandi government, most of whom have been baying for the blood of their secretaries for their alleged failure to comply with the ministerial wishes and orders. the shifting of energy secretary r s poddar, road construction secretary neelam nath and health secretary sunila basant are glaring examples of the compulsions of coalition government. while mahato had been crying hoarse over the ""wayward attitude"" of the energy secretary, road construction minister sudesh mahato had also expressed unhappiness over the functioning of his secretary several times. health minister dinesh sarangi had at one point of time threatened to resign if basant did not mend her ways. excise minister ramesh singh munda of the samata party, nursing similar grievances, had given an ultimatum to chief minister marandi to constitute an nda coordination committee and settle the matters relating to minister-secretary differences. subsequently, marandi held marathon meetings with the alliance partners after which the ministers appeared appeased. with monday's reshuffling of secretaries, it is now being said that the chief minister had actually agreed to a compromise at the meeting. ""it is all for the benefit of the state,"" commented a bureaucrat.

8,Kannada software to interact with govt ready,"bangalore: chief minister krishna will launch the font software `script manager', for kannada language in windows and ms office on august 25. the kannada software, developed along the lines of the american standard code for information interchange (ascii) and indian standard code for information interchange (iscii), will be used for all correspondence with the government by software developers wanting to sell products at the district, taluk and even secretariat level. an it department official said the logical keyboard layout has been standardised which all kannada software developers could use if they want to sell their products. this is in line with the state government order in november 2000. the krishna government is also in touch with the union ministry of information technology, which has developed a unicode standard for all languages of the world. the unicode concept has been standardised for indian, chinese and japanese languages. as for kannada, the government is in touch with the world body, the unicode consortium, who decides the common standards for all languages of the world. ``we will intimate the centre about the new code formulated for kannada fonts.'' the unicode consortium intimates all software developers, including microsoft, on the standards to be followed globally. microsoft has already come out with the software. once unicode comes into existence, everybody will have to come in line, the official said.

9,'Noise pollution rules blatantly flouted',"pune: the police were mere spectators on monday night as hundreds of ganesh mandal workers danced away to deafening music on the occasion of krishna janmashtami, ending the dahi-handi breaking ritual well past midnight. this, in blatant violation of the noise pollution (regulation and control) rules as well as the supreme court ban on the use of loudspeakers after 10 p.m. ganesh mandals that organised the dahi-handi celebrations had erected banks of loudspeakers far ahead of the human pyramids trying to get to the dahi handis. the deafening music - which mainly included popular numbers, instead of prayers to krishna - continued till 1.30 a.m. at the city post office chowk and mahatma phule mandai. policemen on duty had the usual argument: ""no one has complained about the noise. and we don't wish to create a law and order problem by confiscating the loudspeakers."" though citizens may not have dared lodge complaints, this does not give a clean chit to the police for not initiating action against those violating the ban. moreover, according to the noise pollution (regulation and control) rules 2002, the police can take suo motu action to curb noise pollution. and yet, no complaint was registered by the police stations. the blaring music was clearly audible at the nearby vishrambaugwada police station and the mahatma phule mandai police chowky, near the venues of the dahi-handi celebrations. similarly, the deafening music played by another mandal at paud phata flyover, was audible at the kothrud police station. citizen are scared to lodge complaints. ""the mandal workers will make my life miserable if i complain. why do the police want us to lodge a complaint when they themselves are witness to the violation of rules?"" asked on citizen. in fact, the bombay high court committee, which elicited views of over 100 citizens on noise pollution, has observed that just 16 people of the total 100 surveyed had dared to complain against the harassment and trauma caused by the noise. 'no effective action was taken by the authorities in 93 per cent of these cases. the fear that the authorities may disclose the name of the complainant to the noise-maker deters people from complaining. even in the stray cases where the authorities have taken action, the relief has been only temporary. immediately after the authorities concerned left the site, the noise-level was raised much higher than that existing before the complaint was lodged,' the committee further said. besides, even when citizens have complained - the tilak road residents have filed a complaint with the police under section 19 (b) of the environment protection act - no action has been taken. ""the high court order to extend the 10-p.m. deadline for the ganesh kala krida manch (gkkm) programmes during the pune festival should have been challenged by the police too as they have been made defendants in the case and it is their duty to ensure that the deadline is not violated,"" a tilak road resident pointed out. while alert and civic-conscious citizens may dare to complain to the authorities, the ganesh mandal workers have made a strong statement through the late night dahi-handi celebrations: that the order issued by the police commissioner to ban loudspeakers after 10 p.m. would be violated during the 10-day ganesh festival.
