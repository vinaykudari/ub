0,Councillor bores holes into rules,"CHANDIGARH: In blatant violation of the rules and regulations, a private tubewell is being operated at the intersection of Sectors 43 and 44 by none other than a municipal councillor!

While boring of private tubewells is strictly prohibited in the Union Territory, considering the diminishing groundwater table, the councillorâ€™s tubewell is supplying water to at least 70 to 100 water tankers every day.

Investigations by Times News Network revealed that the tubewell, owned by the municipal councillor of ward number eight, Kuldip Singh, has been existing for a number of years.

A visit to the place revealed a long queue of water tankers, which it was found were supplying the water to marriage and religious functions, and for construction purposes.

Those manning the tubewell said that at least 70 to 100 tankers were filled everyday.

Each tanker pays anything between Rs 50 to Rs 100 although the employees said they collect not more than Rs 25 per tanker.

The same tanker supplied water for anything between Rs 450 to Rs 550. As per a recent survey by the Central Ground Water Board, the shallow water in the city, especially in the southern sectors, is not fit for consumption.

Which makes the quality of water being supplied by the tankers highly suspect.

The councillor, to maximise profits, has also given out water connections from the illegal tubewell to nearby shops and service centres.

For instance a pipeline supplies a scooter service centre water for servicing and other purposes.

Prem Singh, Kuldip Singhâ€™s brother, when talked to, denied having any hand in the tubewell business.

The employees at the tubewell had said it belonged to him.

â€˜â€˜The tubewell belongs to Kuldip, who is a municipal councillor, and he has been managing it since long. At one point of time it was also given on monthly rent basis. There is no legal sanction although it has been functional for a long time,â€™â€™ he admitted.

Kuldip Singh, when contacted, told Times News Network,â€˜â€˜The tubewell was installed for irrigation purposes on agricultural land owned by our family. When the land was acquired by the Chandigarh Housing Board, all that was left was this patch with the tubewell, that has been functional ever since.â€™â€™ Municipal corporation chief engineer V K Bhardwaj told TNN, â€˜â€˜This tubewell is not in the knowledge of civic authorities.â€™â€™

He promised an investigation.

2,Mayoral election may be delayed,"MUZAFFARPUR: A writ petition, which was admitted by the Patna High Court on Wednesday, has put a legal hurdle in the impending election of mayors and chairpersons of different municipal corporations and municipalities in the state.

The petition has been filed by convener of Mahila Jagran Morcha Shakuntala Devi, wife of one Raghunath Adig of Muzaffarpur. She has alleged discrimination in the rights of voters of rural and urban areas which is a a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution providing for equality before law. Whereas the heads of gram panchayats, i.e. mukhiyas, have been directly elected by rural voters, the voters of urban areas are going to be deprived of the right to directly elect mayors and chairpersons of municipal bodies, she has claimed.

Explaining the situation, Adig, who was responsible for delay in the municipal election at Muzaffarpur for about two decades because of his writ in Patna High Court, claimed on Thursday that the anomalies have crept in only because the old laws like Bihar and Orissa Municipal Act of 1922 and Patna Municipal Act of 1951 were allowed to exist after some minor amendments whereas the Bihar legislature enacted a fresh panchayati raj Act in 1993 by repealing the old panchayati raj Act after the 73rd and 74th amendments in the Constitution.

On the basis of the writ petition CWJC no. 6065/2002, a division bench of the high court consisting of Chief Justice Ravi S Dhawan and Justice Shasank Kumar Singh has directed to issue showcause notice to the government and has fixed July 1 as the next date of hearing. Senior advocate Mihir Kumar Jha and advocate Namrata Mishra appeared on behalf of the petitioner and standing counsel R L Datta defended the government. Adig''s own writ petition had been rejected by the court earlier. Then his wife filed another petition with another set of lawyers and this was admitted for hearing.

Although the government has so far not issued any notification for election of mayors etc, the writ may delay the election if the government wants to hold such elections before July 1 next, it may be noted.

It was Adig who had filed a writ petition in 1983 and 1987, challenging the ""irrational division"" of wards of Muzaffarpur Municipal Corporation. This delayed the municipal election here for about two decades. Only time will tell how long the present writ delays the election of mayors etc.

4,5 arrested for peacock deaths,"LUCKNOW: Acting swiftly against a poaching gang operating in Mahoba, the state forest department apprehended five people charged with poisoning 20 peacocks in the district, late on Friday night. According to reports reaching the forest headquarters, the five were nabbed following a joint operation conducted by the forest department and the local police.

The incident, which occurred late on Thursday night, has landed the UP forest department in a soup, as 19 peacocks were killed by poachers in Nathupura and Dilrahi in the last year too. The fact that the poachers got away scot free the last time around, seriously dented the forestersâ€™ reputation. Hence there was a lot of pressure on the foresters to act promptly this time.

The death of the peacocks â€” the national bird of India â€” comes close on the heels of a government of India move to finalise a policy decision banning the trade of peacock feathers â€” sent ripples in wildlife circles. Needless to say, the state foresters were put in a tight spot.

â€œSince the culprits have been identified, it is just a matter of time before we arrest them,â€� chief wildlife warden R L Singh said.

The Union Environment Ministry earlier this month, had sent a directive to the state government in the first week of May (DO.No PPS/ADGF (WL)/2002) asking them to furnish details regarding the number of licenses issued for the trading of peacock feathers.

Even as the state officials maintained that no such licenses had been issued, the killing of the national bird has left the forest department with a bloody nose.

Union minister and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi has also in the past, written to the UP forest department complaining about the poaching of the bird.

5,Mayawati govt wins trust vote,"LUCKNOW: Despite the opposition putting up a joint front, the Mayawati-led BSP-BJP coalition government in Uttar Pradesh won the trust vote comfortably through lobby division in the lower House on Friday. The government secured 217 votes as against 180 mustered by the joint opposition.

After a seven-and-half-hour marathon debate on the confidence motion tabled by chief minister Mayawati, Speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi first sought to ascertain the numbers through voice vote and later through raising of hands. It was followed by lobby division when the opposition pressed for it. Significantly, the Mayawati government bagged seven more votes than the list of 210 members supporting the BSP-BJP coalition submitted to governor Vishnukant Shastri when she had staked claim for formation of the BSP-BJP coalition government in the state on April 29. In a House of 399, only 397 members were present at the time of voting. One independent MLA Mukhtar Anasri did not turn up. Speaker is required to vote only in case of a tie.

As was expected, the lone All-India Hindu Mahasabha MLA Radha Mohan Das, about six others and independents, including BSP rebel RK Chowdhury, Rashtriya Lok Dal-supported Vijay Singh (Farrukhabad) and others voted in favour of the ruling coalition. Speculations were rife that one opposition member has also crossed floor.

Coalition partners who voted in favour of the confidence motion included the BSP (97), BJP (88), Rashtriya Lok Dal (14), UP Loktantrik Congress Party, Janata Dal-U and Lok Janasakti (two each), independents (10-11).

Importantly, the opposition started on a positive note putting up a joint front against the coalition governmentâ€™s trust vote. Even the Congress, which had denied support to the Samajwadi Party on government formation, joined the opposition bandwagon and voted against the motion.

Opposition parties which voted against the motion included Samajwadi Party and allies (144), Congress (25), Rashtriya Kranti Party and Apna Dal (three each), Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya), Janata Party, Rashtriya Parivartan Dal, National Loktantrik Party (one each) and one independent.

Pandemonium prevailed when a controversy arose in the House over the voting pattern on the motion. Under Rule 298, the Speaker sought a voice vote to ascertain the number of members favouring the motion and against. It was followed by raising of hands. But Leader of the Opposition Mohammed Azam Khan demanded vote by lobby division. Terming oppositionâ€™s demand as â€˜unjustifiedâ€™, the Speaker ruled voting by raising hands. This invited angry protests from the opposition benches.

Surprisingly, Tripathi changed his decision and took no time in accepting the opposition demand once the result of the counting of hands from the treasury benches favoured the confidence motion with 216 supporting it.

6,Power failure keeps haunting govt,"HYDERABAD: The fluctuations in power supply continue to haunt the state government putting the energy department officials on their toes during important events.

If it was the power failure during the inaugural address of governor C Rangarajan to the budget session of the Assembly which earned severe criticism from the opposition parties, on Friday power went off when ministers were making presentations on the performance indicators of different departments at the Dr Marri Channa Reddy Human Resources Development Institute causing embarrassment to the state administration.

The workshop was attended by chief minister , his cabinet colleagues and senior officials.

It all began when power went off while social welfare minister J R Pushparaj was making a presentation on the achievements of the welfare departments and the targets fixed for the departments during the current year.With the supply not restored even after five minutes, the institute authorities made some alternative arrangements.

Sensing the situation, Pushparaj hurriedly concluded his presentation making way for industries minister K Vidyadher Rao to make a presentation on his departmentâ€™s activities.

It was here again the power supply too failed and the minister was forced to continue his speech without a mike. With the darkness engulfing the auditorium of the HRD Institute, the chief ministerâ€™s security personnel rushed out at one stage only to bring a high focus torch inside the hall.

It was only after the industries minister concluded his speech the power supply was restored.

The chief minister during his address, took enough care to clarify that the power failure was due to an internal problem.

7,Tribals pelt stones at police party,"VIJAYAWADA: A mob of 150 tribals attacked a police party with stones and arrows in the Jeelugumilli forest area early on Friday morning, injuring six police personnel.

The police opened two rounds of fire in the air to quell the mob.

According to police, a team led by Jangareddygudem circle inspector B Venkateswara Rao went to Pakalavarigudem village under Jeelugumilli mandal in West Godavari district around 3 am on Friday to arrest a CPM activist, Punem Brahmaiah, who allegedly extorted Rs 5 lakh in the name of securing lands for the tribals.

Upon reaching the village the CI took two persons into custody for their alleged involvement in various land dispute cases in the area.

Meanwhile, a 150-strong mob of tribals led by Punem Brahmaiah and others surrounded the police and prevented them from taking away the two persons. The mob allegedly hurled stones at the police, besides attacking them with arrows and spears.

Six police personnel and a private jeep driver were injured in the attack. The wind shields of the two police jeeps were also shattered. In the melee, the two persons apprehended by the police gave the slip.

West Godavari superintendent of police Kripanand Tripathi Ujela said the police was forced to open fire as the mob did not relent despite repeated requests. The police showed utmost restraint to ensure that the situation did not slip out of hand, he added.

Fridayâ€™s incident comes in the wake of surrender of more than 200 tribals to the police last week.

8,Experts recommend a dept for disinvestment,"MUMBAI: The state should create a department for disinvestment rather than bank on the statutory Maharashtra Board for Restructuring of State Enterprises to trim the flab in government-owned enterprises, experts suggest.

These enterprises contribute to the stateâ€™s poor fiscal health because of the huge amounts of capital invested in them and the government guarantees for much of their borrowings. They received hidden subsidies of Rs 1,140 crore in 1997-98, almost 20 times more than the Rs 54 cr they got in 1985-86.

Though a senior bureaucrat proposed the establishment of such a disinvestment department a few years ago, the idea hasnâ€™t found favour. The board for restructuring has only limited powersâ€”it can only formulate plans for units that are referred to it by the government. Itâ€™s also hampered by a lack of political will to shut down loss-making corporations.

A dedicated department would presumably be able to overcome these limitations. In addition, it could seek the advice of professional consultants.

Many inoperative corporations still exist because the bureaucrats who head them donâ€™t have the expertise to restructure them or close them down. Adding to this, even public sector units that play vital roles run up huge losses. For example, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation,which runs buses to remote parts of the state, runs up losses of over Rs 200 cr every year. Bureaucrats say they need professional advice from consultants and financial experts to restructure essential public sector units and fold up the others.

The Maharashtra board set up last September says it is doing exactly that, and has sought the expertise of such consulting agencies as CRISIL. Sharad Upasani, chairperson of the board, believes the board can make a difference. Though the state doesnâ€™t stand to earn much revenue from selling these units, Mr Upasani said that the focus is on saving on subsidies. â€œWe want to dispel the impression that by selling assets, you would necessarily create wealth. Our target is to not spend any more on these units.â€™â€™

Maharashtra has floated special corporations quite generously, to deal with sectors like fisheries, oilseeds and sheep and goat development. Others were established to boost development in the Konkan, Vidarbha and Marathawada regions that have fallen short in implementing programmes.

Many units are scam-tainted. For instance, the Mahatma Phule and Vasantrao Naik corporations for the backward classes were named in the multicrore cobblersâ€™ scam. The two allegedly funded bogus cobblersâ€™ cooperatives to illegally access public funds.

â€œThere is a nexus between politicians and the corporation authorities,â€™â€™ said a Mantralaya official. â€œThere are a number of scams brewing in each of these units, but none are bared since it benefits everyone,â€™â€™ said a senior official.

Many of these corporations do not even carry out an audit. It is learnt that Mahatma Phule Backward Class Development Corporation is one of the worst performers, having last audited its accounts in 1986-87. Lokshahir Annabhau Sathe Development Corporation follows close behind, with no audits after 1987-88. The CAG is known to have passed strictures against the corporations on this score.

â€œLack of political will is at the root of this thriving public sector,â€™â€™ says a senior official. â€œFor all political regimes, these offer a great buffer.â€™â€™ The cleansing, he adds, has to begin at home.

9,CM announces biotech policy,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced the stateâ€™s biotechnology policy on Friday.

Greater efficiency in food preservation methods, more succulent fruit and vegetable products and promotion of medicinal plants are part of the new biotechnolgy policy.

The state will rope in the private sector and several incentives to the industrial sector under the state incentive scheme 2000 have been announced.

These include capital investment subsidy, interest sub-sidy, waiver of electricity duty and employment generation subsidy.

Although research and development in biotechnology had been going on for some time, there had been little growth in industry, the chief minister said. Research was simply concentrated in growing different varieties of rice.

The thrust areas would now be development of new varieties of wheat, pulses, fruits, vegetables, flowers, apart from rice. Emphasis would also be given to medicines and medicinal plants.

In Raiganj, north Bengal, a private sector firm is growing genetically en-gineered varieties of pineapples with Italian collaboration.

Similar projects will start with mango varieties in Malda and potatoes in Hooghly and Burdwan.

A centre of excellence in biotechnology under the state university of technology will be set up.

Apart from the biotech park at IIT, Kharagpur, another one will come up in Burdwan. The government is seeking aid from universities in US and Cuba.

10,Gujarat ministers boycott Gill,"GANDHINAGAR: Still unsure about his powers and unclear about the protocol they should maintain with him, ministers in the Narendra Modi government seem to be giving the cold shoulder to the chief ministerâ€™s security adviser K P S Gill.

On Thursday afternoon, Gill reportedly got a rude shock when none of the three ministers, invited by him to discuss restoration of peace in Ahmedabad, turned up for the meeting.

The three ministers â€” Gordhan Zadaphia (home), Haren Pandya (revenue) and Bharat Barot (civil supplies) â€” were invited to meet Gill at 1.30 pm at the CRPF guest house near here where he stays.

It is learnt that Gill was interested in meeting them because not only are they MLAs from Ahmedabad, their ministries have a bearing on policing besides relief and rehabilitation for riot victims. Sources said one of the ministers was not comfortable meeting Gill at the CRPF guest house and instead wanted the meeting to be held in the Sachivalay where Gill too has an office.

Another minister pretended to be busy with some other work while the third one was just not interested.

The incident has set tongues wagging about the possibility of Modi himself giving broad hints to the ministers not to pay too much attention to Gill.

It may be mentioned that Gillâ€™s appointment at the insistence of the Union government had taken the entire officialdom in Gujarat by surprise.

Official sources said it was only natural for Gill to understand the perspective of these ministers who are old political hands of Ahmedabad and could have helped him understand the prevailing situation better.

13,I-cards mandatory for Bhadrak by-election,"BHUBANESWAR: Presentation of photo identity cards or some other document to prove the voter''s bonafides at the polling booths has been made mandatory for the May 31 by-election to the Bhadrak assembly constituency, official sources said.

14,BJP welcomes govt's decision to send back Qazi,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday welcomed the government''s decision asking Pakistan High Commissioner Ashraf Jehangir Qazi to return to his country and virtually accused him of doing intelligence work for Islamabad.

Terming the decision as ""good step"", the party general secretary Pyarelal Khandelwal said, ""it is a clear message to Pakistan that the Indian government is serious and we are hopeful that the international community would realise the seriousness of the situation and how this country views the threat.""

Senior party leader J P Mathur said it was unfortunate that Pakistan High Commissioner stayed put in this country even after India had recalled its representative from that country. Unfortunately, Qazi stayed put unashamedly. One could imagine what the ulterior motive could be and he was doing for his country what a diplomat of his status should not have done,"" Mathur said.

He said it was a known fact that the embassy of every country has a person linked with their intelligence agency and this sort of job is never done through the ambassador or high commissioner.

15,"Come clean on power project, JDU tells govt","BELLARY: Transparency is the word the Janata Dal (United) has latched on to, and is demanding that the Congress government make clear its project proposal connected with the Bellary Thermal Power Station (BTPS).

JD(U) general secretary N. Pratap Reddy claimed that the National Thermal Power Corporation had rejected the proposal by the Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC), which has taken up the project with the state government''s participation.

BTPS has been sanctioned under the special `Sonia package'' at a cost of Rs 2,500 crore, and is slated to come up near Kuditini village, 20 km from here.

Reddy clarified that the NTPC had rejected the project proposal during a recent meeting, in which Chief Minister S.M. Krishna had participated. It was also attended by the chairmen and managing directors of KPC, NTPC and Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation (KPTC). Elaborate discussions were held during which these players ruled out taking up the project as a joint venture. If the validity of the project is being questioned, and it is being turned down, the government must be misleading the public and hiding some important facts, he added.

The JD(U), therefore, is demanding that the government place all facts and figures on the table, since it boasts itself on transparency. Reddy ridiculed the government''s efforts to attract partners, whereas a project of this proportion should be snapped up by big players.

The project proposals have no specific design or road map, he alleged.

Why is the government going in for a joint venture when funds have been earmarked for it, he asked. If Rs 2,500 crore is being used from the Rs 3,300 crore package, the government does not need a funding partner.

The Congress is misleading the public with false assurances, Reddy alleged. The government had earmarked Rs 3.5 crore to build a compound wall around the BTPS project site, which is a waste since the BTPS is yet to get clearance from the NTPC. Leaders and ministers just want to keep the electorate happy, he said.

Cautioning the government on similar promises over three lift irrigation schemes __ Yalpi-Kaggallu, Kenchanagudda and Kolur __ Reddy said the JD(U) would resort to a relay hunger strike after June 2, as decided this month. If the government fails to respond, it will be strike unto death, he warned.

Reddy said that all tenders regarding the construction of a barrage and intake channels of the revised Singatalur Lift Irrigation Project have been cancelled. The tenders were called seven months ago, but as the government did not respond and failed to finalise the deal, the tenders stand cancelled. With this, Water Resources Minister H.K. Patil''s dream project is dying apremature death, thanks to the confusion of his own making, Reddy added.

16,No SAS if Cong wins MCC polls,"MANGALORE: Congress leader B. Janardhan Poojary on Saturday reiterated that if the Congress came to power after winning the forthcoming corporation polls, it would not impose self-assessment tax scheme (SAS) on the people. Nor would it increase any tax to raise money to pay the ADB-funded project.

``As the city corporation is an autonomous body, it has the right to reject or implement the proposed SAS,'''' he asserted. He was countering the statements made by the BJP and the Janata Dal that the Congress was making ridiculous statements on SAS and it was a political stunt.

Poojary said that in the past five years, the Corporation led by the Congress had kept up its promise by not raising taxes and augmented resources through better mobilisation of funds. This had led to increase of collection of taxes from Rs 27 crore to Rs 60 crore, he claimed.

``Take the case of the central government. It keeps revising its revenue collection figures from time to time as it cannot mobilise resources,'''' he said, claiming that the Mangalore City Corporation (MCC) was the only corporation in the entire country which managed its resources without burdening the citizens.

``There are lots of laws which are still in the books. Take, for example, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). The 13 Congress-ruled states have decided against implementing Pota and the Centre can do nothing with it,'''' he said and drew a parallel, saying that likewise SAS can also be rejected by the corporation.

He again countered another of BJP''s statement as how he could make statements to this effect. Poojary said: ``I am from the Congress. The candidates are from the Congress and I have taken a solemn commitment from them that they would not increase the taxes. This is why I made the announcement.''''

``The BJP does not have any issue. For us, there are many issues. So, BJP is going on about SAS,'''' he added. Carrying the attack to the BJP camp, Poojary said as the BJP did not know how to govern, most of the states are not under its control and those it had, it lost in the recent polls. ``They lost power as they are masters in bluffing and changing their masks,'''' he said.

Regarding the statement made by Union Minister of State for Textiles Dhananjaya Kumar that the Karnataka government had increased the power tariff in order to cover up its failure on the transmission and distribution (T&D) front, despite an allocation of 110 MW through the southern grid, Poojary said: ``Let him give the date and time when the power was supplied to the state. It''s easy to make statements. The minister is lying.''''

Poojary apologised to the public for causing inconvenience during campaigning on Friday. He said there was no other way to approach people and counter the false propaganda being carried out by the BJP.
