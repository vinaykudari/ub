0,"2,500 constables at the mercy of MPSC rules","MUMBAI: Over 2,500 police constables in Maharashtra will not be able to take a competitive examination, conducted by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission for selection to the post of sub-inspectors, this Sunday.

A bunch of petitions challenging their disqualification by the MPSC was admitted by the Bombay high court on Friday but no relief was granted to the constables.

A division bench of Chief Justice C K Thakker and Justice V K Tahilramani said it could not grant any relief to the constables, at this stage, in view of the examination rules prescribed under the Police Act.

The MPSC had last held the examination for selection of police sub-inspectors in 1998, and prior to that in 1991.

The commission was allowing those who were eligible in 1991 to appear for the forthcoming examination. However, those candidates who subsequently fulfilled the educational and service conditions but had become age barred (age limit is 35) were disqualified from taking the examination now.

Additional government pleader Jyoti Pawar informed the court that the state government had on April 7 asked the commission to consider its irrational stand. She noted that the MPSC was allowing those who were eligible in January 1991 even though they had crossed the age bar to take the June 29 examination.

However, the MPSC had disqualified candidates who had become eligible post-1991 but were now age barred.

She said the MPSC had responded to its April 7 letter after two months, expressing its inability in permitting all candidates to take the examination. The court, too, criticised MPSC''s delayed response to the state''s request and observed that the commission has not even replied to another request made by the state on June 23.

Advocate Sanjay Singhvi representing some of the constables argued that the decision to reject applications was made at the eleventh hour on June 21 even though forms were submitted earlier.

The constables'' argument was that since no exams were held in the last few years by the MPSC, they had become age barred for no fault of theirs.

1,"Gujarat's borrowings high, development spending low","GANDHINAGAR: The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report, â€˜State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2002-03â€™, reveals that Gujaratâ€™s gross fiscal deficit (GFD) â€” the total borrowings of a state to finance its budget â€” has been one of the highest in India.

At Rs 9,752.5 crore, the budget estimate for 2002-03 suggests that the stateâ€™s GFD is next only to West Bengalâ€™s, which is at Rs 11,315.2 crore.

Expressing serious concern over the trend that has engulfed all Indian states, the RBIâ€™s initial remarks are noteworthy: â€œThe state governments have been experiencing fiscal stress in recent years as evident from large and increasing fiscal and revenue deficits. The rise in the GFD was pronounced in the second half of the 1990s, with an increasing proportion being accounted for by the rising revenue deficit.â€�

Standing at Rs 5,815.9 crore in 2002-03, the revenue deficit of Gujarat is higher than all other states. Again, West Bengal is the only state with a higher revenue deficit. As a percentage of GFD, the stateâ€™s revenue deficit was 59.6 per cent. Only two other states â€” Kerala and West Bengal â€” had a higher percentage figure at 71.8 per cent and 68.9 per cent respectively. Comments the study, â€œMore than one-half of the GFD has been on account of the revenue deficit. This implies that a significant proportion of borrowed funds have been utilised for meeting revenue expenditure. The accumulation of debt and debt service obligations has put constraints on the stateâ€™s ability to undertake developmental activity.â€�

The RBI figures show that Gujaratâ€™s debt in March-end 2003 stood at Rs 46,689 crore.

States with a heavier debtload than Gujaratâ€™s included AP (Rs 50,638 crore) and Maharashtra (Rs 61,324 crore). In 2001, Gujaratâ€™s debt was Rs 29,786 crore and in 2002, Rs 38,102 crore. Quite in line with the RBIâ€™s observation for the country, the higher borrowings to finance the budgetary deficits, have lead to an increase in debt, and have had an adverse impact on Gujaratâ€™s developmental expenditure. The budget estimate for 2002-03, quoted by the RBI, suggests that developmental expenditure has gone down by 8.3 per cent over the previous year.At Rs 19,763 crore now, it was Rs 21,551.8 crore in 2001-02.

This happened when most progressive states experienced a rise in developmental expenditure. The only other progressive state that showed deceleration was Maharashtra which had a drop of 8.9 per cent. Gujaratâ€™s nondevelopmental expenditure rose by 10.5 per cent, from Rs 7,583.9 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 8,378.3 crore in 2002-03.

The RBI study reveals just four states â€” Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab â€” have initiated measures to â€œprovide statutory backing to the fiscal reform process through enabling legislation.â€� The result â€” Gujarat figures in the list of 10 states that have experienced â€œlower rate of growth in revenue receiptsâ€�.

The Gujarat government believes that the RBI study does not give the full picture of the state of the finances. Official sources said the GFD figure should be revised as it does not calculate a rise in sales tax revenue by Rs 500 crore, a dip in interest payment by Rs 800 crore, and receipt of about Rs 300 crore as extra royalty. â€œThe GFD would be around Rs 7,200 crore finally,â€� said one official.

2,RBI orders banks to increase farm credits,"KOLKATA: The Reserve Bank of India has asked nationalised banks to increase credit flow to agriculture, small industries and agribusiness in West Bengal, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Friday.

â€œUnless there is social banking, agribusiness and industry will not grow,â€� said the minister. He added that the government would help recover the loans.

Dasgupta and self-employment minister Md Salim discussed the issue with RBI deputy governor Vepa Kamesan, senior officials of nationalised banks and Nabard at the State Level Bankersâ€™ Committee meeting.

A special committee, which will comprise representatives of banks as well as the state government, will monitor the loan sanction, disbursement and recovery. Dasgupta and Salim would visit the districts to ensure better co-ordination. According to Dasgupta, the RBI has appreciated the stateâ€™s complaint of a low credit-deposit ratio.

Though nationalised banks had a deposit of Rs 80,000 crore from the state as on December 2002, only 45.04 per cent of the amount was forwarded as loans.

The national ratio was 57.7 per cent during that period. The RBI has instructed the banks to increase the ratio to three per cent more, so that the state can achieve parity with the national ratio within the 10th Plan period.

Only Rs 1,000 crore was sanctioned to the agro-allied sector, mainly by the cooperative banks, while the need is 10-fold. Now, the state has demanded at least Rs 2,000 crore.

Nabard has agreed to cover 1.45 lakh peasants in West Bengal under the Kisan Credit Card scheme during the present fiscal. The number of eligible farmers, according to Dasgupta, is 60 lakh.

Though the number of small and self-employment units has grown from 18 lakh to 27 lakh in West Bengal, only Rs 400 crore was given to the state. Dasgupta has demanded Rs 1,000 crore during the current fiscal.

3,Energy minister admits electrification is slow,"PATNA: Energy minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan on Friday said that rural electrification had made slow progress in the state. Responding to a short notice question of BJP member Nand Kishore Yadav during the pre-lunch session of the state assembly, Khan said the target had not been met.

He said that out of 7,000 villages to have been electrified during 2002-03, Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) had managed to electrify only 1,500 villages. ""However, the process has been accelerated this year. We have given the job of electrifying over 2,000 villages in Vaishali and Muzaffarpur to Power Grid Corporation of India,"" Khan said, adding that all the villages in the state would be electrified by year 2007.

He said that funds earmarked for the purpose, both by the state government and the Centre, had not been utilised. ""We have constituted state and regional level committees to select villages for electrification,"" Khan said. His claim was refuted by BJP MLA Ashwani Choubey, who said that meetings of these committees were not being held.

The question on rural electrification opened a floodgate of complaints cutting across party lines on the functioning of BSEB. Lalit Yadav of the RJD alleged that a village in his constituency had not been electrified even two years after the decision to this effect had been taken. Dasai Choudhary of the same party made a similar complaint. An MLA challenged the ministerâ€™s version that villages in the Tal area were being electrified.

In response to another question by Chandra Mohan Rai, Khan said that BSEB had over 21,000 employees entailing salary payment of over Rs 21 crore per month. The Boardâ€™s functioning came in for strong criticism as legislators alleged that employees connived in theft of wire. Junior minister Shyam Rajak said that employees, too, were responsible for the theft of wires and promised action against them. He also stated that certificate cases would be lodged against persons and government agencies for defaulting in payment.

In reply to a starred question, health minister Shakuni Choudhary said that he had ordered civil surgeons to make a list of ""absconding doctors"". ""We will take action against all doctors who are missing from their places of posting,"" he said, when Rajendra Rajan of CPI complained that most of the doctors posted in health centres in his constituency had been missing for the past three years.

4,Uproar over minister's link with criminals in assembly,"PATNA: Samata Party members raised an uproar in the state assembly on Friday over the alleged links of junior health minister Akhilesh Singh with criminals.

As soon as the House assembled for the day, Samata members stormed into the well raising slogans like ""Apradhi minister istifa do"". They also displayed placards against Akhilesh. Speaker Sadanand Singh asked the legislators to go back to their seats and instructed the marshal to remove the placards.

The action drew angry retorts from the ruling party benches. ""Why don''t you take the name of Dr C P Thakur? He was involved in the kidnapping of Dr Ramesh Chandra,"" said junior energy minister Shyam Rajak. Panchayati Raj minister Upendra Prasad Verma objected to the charges levelled against a member of the House. Though the Speaker had asked the Samata members to raise the issue during zero hour, the party leader Upendra Prasad Singh was not allowed to do so.

The CPI(ML) members also staged a dharna in the well of the House on the issue of railway accident on the Masaurhi-Nadwan line due to a dumper. They were later persuaded to raise the matter during zero hour. Ram Naresh Ram, raising the matter during zero hour, demanded an adequate compensation for the family of the deceased youth Vikas Kumar and action against the railway contractor concerned.

Prem Kumar (BJP) demanded the arrest of the persons named as accused in the killing of BJP leader Satya Narayan Sinha in Danapur on the day the RJD held its lathi rally in Patna. Leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that the main accused in the murder case, Riti Lal Yadav, is openly moving around.

5,Jabir asks govt to get details of guessing,"PATNA: Legislative council chairman Jabir Hussain on Friday asked the government to get detailed information about the illegal business of ""guessing"", a flourishing form of gambling, in Patna district. The details should include the number of ""guessing gangs"" busted by the police in the recent past in the district.

Earlier, the issue of growing business of ""guessing"" in the district was raised by RJD MLC Ramkripal Yadav during zero hour. He said this illegal business had spread to rural parts of the district from the state capital and other towns.

""Due to the apathy shown by senior police officers, junior police officers have made this a major source of income for themselves,"" he alleged. According to him, this business had led young boys to take to drugs as well.

Ramkripal Yadav told the House that the government had earlier given clear instruction to the police headquarters to immediately suspend those officers in-charge under whose areas ""guessing gangs"" were busted. ""But, senior police officers have now ignored this directive of the government,"" he said.

Incidentally, the city police busted two centres of ""guessing business"" falling under the Pirbahore and Gandhi Maidan police stations during the current month. However, no action against the officials of these police stations has been taken, police sources said.

6,Projects for loan to be made flawless: Minister,"PATNA: An agricultural state like Bihar should not be equated with industrial states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and the Andhra Pradesh, but with states having agricultural base like Punjab and Haryana while discussing the topic ""Role of Banks in Development of Bihar and Employment Generation"".

Minister for co-operatives Veena Shahi said this on Friday while giving the governmentâ€™s reply on a debate on the topic that was initiated by Samata Party member Mangni Lal Mandal in state legislative council. She, however, seemed to agree that bank officials usually came to Bihar with a negative mindset and a prejudice that the state had no industrial environment, and so far as the matter of loan recovery was concerned, it was a difficult task.

She said that this negative attitude of the bank officials was detrimental to the stateâ€™s development and employment generation. She charged the Centre of according step-motherly treatment to Bihar, and pointed out that banks'' branches had been set up in Punjab at the rate of one branch per 9,000 of people, whereas in Bihar it was for 23,000 of people.

Shahi said that the state government had planned to create a mechanism for helping entrepreneurs in making project appraisals, which, she felt, was the main weakness of those who went

for bank loans, when the banks turned down their proposals.

She said the new arrangement will help in making the project proposals flawless, which would enable entrepreneurs to get their projects cleared by the banks.

She said that co-operative banks would be streamlined from the recovery point of view, and also added that the Primary Agricultural Co-operative Credit Societies (PACCSs) had been allowed to function as mini banks at the lower level.

Mandal charged the state government of lacking vision and political will to control bank authorities to help provide loans to the loanees of the state. BJP members Birkeshwar Singh, Saryu Rai, CPM member Basudeo Singh, CPI member B N Lal, Janata Dal (U) member Tanveer Hassan and RJD member Ramkripal Yadav were prominent among those who participated in the debate.

Industrial policy: Industries minister Vishwamohan Sharma formally introduced Industrial Policy â€” 2003 in the state legislative council here on Friday.

7,CM denies rift with minister,"JAMSHEDPUR: Chief minister Arjun Munda on Thursday denied he had any differences with the state''s finance minister Mrigendra Pratap Singh.

""Mrigendraji is a senior member of our cabinet and his approach is always constructive,"" Munda said, denying that his comments were ever targeted towards the former or any other Jharkhand minister. ""My criticism was directed against the style of functioning of governments during the last 50 years and not at anyone from my cabinet,"" he said and asked ""how can I criticise my own government.""

Stating that his recent comments were not intended to hurt anyone, Munda also denied ever saying that there was a system failure in Jharkhand. Upset by the reported criticism, the finance minister had sought to know why if the chief minister considered him to be so inefficient he was not being removed from his post. Meanwhile, Munda also stressed on the need for proper planning to attract investment in the state.

Speaking to newsmen here, Munda pointed out that about Rs 20,000 crore of the state was being invested outside Jharkhand and therefore to hold back such huge investments from going out some re-thinking in the policy was required. The chief minister announced that computerised scanning system at all entry points of Jharkhand would be installed soon to monitor commercial vehicles movement which would help generate an additional revenue to the tune of Rs 900 crore in the remaining months of the current financial year for the state.

About the state government-sponsored ""rath yatra"" in his home constituency in Kharswan in Saraikela-Kharswan district on July 1, Munda said the ""rath yatra"" (Jharkhand Jagran Yatra) was aimed to promote tourism and to launch a campaign for the state''s all-round development.

8,Munda govt has failed: ML leader,"RANCHI: CPI-ML legislator Mahendra Prasad Singh described Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda''s 100 days in office as hundred days of misuse and non-use of funds.

Talking to the media on Friday, Singh said the state government has failed in its role of building a new state. It has failed in providing irrigation facilities, it has failed in maintaining law and order, and it has failed in developing infrastruture. ""It has failed on all fronts,"" Singh said.

The only thing in which this government has succeeded is in ""treating common people with callousness"", he said. Elaborating, Singh said Jharkhand has made more arrests under Pota than the Jammu and Kashmir government, and 83 cases of arrest were found to be wrong. He said that though Pota provided for punitive action against those involved in misusing Pota, no police officer involved in making those 83 arrests has been identified, let alone punished, Singh said.

In the agriculture sector, Singh said, the government provided for Rs 60 crore under plan head in 2001-2002, but it did not spend even Rs 60 on irrigation facilities. Similarly, Jharkhand can earn a lot of revenue from tourism, but out of Rs 19 crore allocated in 2001-02 for this sector not even Rs 19 was spent, he added.Singh also commented that it is strange that Munda wanted to differentiate his 100 days from his predecessor Babulal Marandiâ€™s tenure.

9,Naidu keeps the pressure on Central govt,"HYDERABAD: While the talks between the Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka delegations were held in a cordial atmosphere, the former state indicated it would not ease the pressure on the Centre to resolve the issue.

Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Friday wrote yet another letter to Union water resources minister Arjun Charan Sethi reiterating Andhra Pradeshâ€™s stated position on the Paragodu and Upper Tunga projects: the former was clearly an irrigation project violative of the agreements of 1892 and 1933 and the latter an edifice built for excess drawals from the K-8 basin.

The chief minister lobbed the ball into the Centreâ€™s court by pointing out that the Central Water Commission had wrongly assessed the utilisation of Krishna river waters by Karnataka.

Major irrigation minister K Srihari said the stateâ€™s delegation to the CWC meeting presented an effective case on the two Karnataka projects while at the same defending APâ€™s interests on the schemes to which the neighbouring state has objected.

During the parleys, the AP delegation led by principal secretary for irrigation J Harinarayan argued that Paragodu was an irrigation project in the disguise of a water supply scheme.

To this, Karnataka water resources principal secretary Naik insisted that drinking water for 87 villages was the only purpose of the dam. CWC chairman R Jayaseelan intervened to say that if indeed it was a drinking water project, it would be tested against the ruling norms.

10,Three arrested for issuing death threats,"HYDERABAD: Three persons were arrested on Friday for issuing death threats to a person in connection with a financial dispute. A cell phone and a motorcycle have also been seized from the arrested persons.

The arrested persons have been identified as Anil Kumar, Rajini Kumar, and Satyanarayana. Anil and Rajini allegedly threatened Jagadeshwar Reddy with dire consequences if he failed to repay money which his late father had borrowed from Satyanarayana.

Anil and Rajini are allegedly members of an Anantapur-based gang headed by a Chaman, who is reportedly a close associate of Penugonda MLA Paritala Ravi.

The gang is reportedly involved in â€˜settlingâ€™ land and financial disputes in Anantapur on a commission basis.

Satyanarayana approached Chaman with the dispute. Chaman entrusted Anil and Rajini with the task of recovering the money from Jagadeshwar Reddy.

The duo telephoned Jagadeshwar several times and threatened to kill him if he did not repay the money.

Jagadeshwar informed the police, who tracked down Satyanarayaa, Anil and Rajini and arrested them.

The arrested persons and the seized material have been handed over to Panjagutta police station for further action, a police press release said.

11,Student commits suicide,"HYDERABAD: An undergraduate student committed suicide on Friday morning after she was not allowed to write her supplementary exams, police said.

According to the Mangalhat police, T Sravanthi, 20, a resident of Azizbagh went into the bathroom in on Friday morning and committed suicide by hanging herself. Her father Ashok Kumar Goud knocked at the bathroom door when his daughter did not come out for a long time. As there was no response from inside, he peeped through the ventilator and saw Sravanthi hanging. By the time he broke open the door, the girl was already dead, police said. A case was registered by the police.

Police said Sravanthi was a student of BSc at Womenâ€™s College, Koti. She failed to clear a few subjects in the recent exams. She wanted to appear for the supplementary exams and went to the college along with her father to pay the exam fee on Thursday. But college authorities refused to accept the exam fee saying she did not have the required attendance. Family sources, however, said she has 69 per cent attendance while the required percentage is is only 65.

Sravanthi, who felt humiliated, was in a depressed state for the rest of the day. Police beleive humiliation tobe the only possible reason for the suicide.

Sravanthi used the dupatta of her churidhar to hang herself from the shower in her bathroom. Sravantiâ€™s father Ashok Kumar is an advocate and local politician. The case is under investigation.

12,Minister gives spin to suicide attempts at juvenile home,"HYDERABAD: Women and child welfare minister S Saraswati claimed some inmates of the Juvenile Home at Saidabad inflicted injuries on themselves only to force the authorities to repatriate them early to their families.

Contradicting media reports, the minister said on Friday that some children were inflicting injuries on themselves only to get the officialsâ€™ attention and win immediate release. Such acts by one or two children have led to others following suit.

There is some delay in the process of repatriating boys as it involves the approval of a magistrate, she added. Children who were neglected, abandoned or lost are housed at the juvenile home.

The minister and officials could not give a satisfactory reply as to why the children were anxious to get back to their parents, even after being neglected and ill-treated.

Women and child welfare principal secretary Minnie Mathews explained that the staff at the juvenile home have been habituated to extending custodial care of children rather than taking care of them like their own children. The department is now inculcating awareness among the staff on this aspect, she added.

Minnie Matthews said the department, after tracing the parents of children, has been counselling them to accept their wards with the cooperation of NGOs. She alleged some staff members at the juvenile home were instigating inmates to revolt against the new superintendent in support of his predecessor, who was suspended on charges of ill-treating the children.

Saraswati admitted the juvenile home lacked adequate facilities and it resembled a jail. However, a new home is being constructed with all facilities, she said.

This was stressed upon at the CSIR Diamond Jubilee lecture on â€˜Environmental challenges: The missing link of science and governanceâ€™, by Sunita Narain, director, Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, and publisher of the fortnightly magazine â€˜Down to Earthâ€™, at NBRI, on Friday.

In a thought provoking lecture, she presented an exhaustive picture of the ecological imbalances in the country and said changes are happening today not because of the government, but in spite of it.

Speaking to reporters, she said the three major threats faced by Indian society today are malnutrition, and air and water pollution. She said people need to think, respect and conserve their natural gifts.

14,BSP will rule India soon: Mayawati,"LUCKNOW: Give the BSP a few more years and it would grab the Delhi crown, declared a confident Mayawati on Friday. Back from a five-day tour of western UP, the chief minister was addressing a press conference in Lucknow.

Prophesying better times ahead for her party, she said that the BSP was doing very well in the Hindi-speaking belt and was also making a steady inroad in the south, adding that dalits would get their due only when the BSP wrested power at the Centre.

Obviously buoyed by her party''s victory in Chiraigaon by-election, the CM took a swipe at the joint opposition front which, she said, was ""created with the sole intention of toppling her government"". The opposition leaders should, if they have any moral streak left, renounce politics and sit back at home, she said, as the victory was a clear verdict delivered against them by the masses.

Lambasting them for the ""drama enacted in Gauriganj earlier"", the CM also raised a question mark on complaints made to the Election Commission which had led to the postponement of the election for a month in Chiraigaon. The state had gone to polls seven times since she took over and the BSP had won five of the seven seats, she declared. This clearly showed which way the public preference lay, Mayawati remarked.

Further, as the winning BSP candidates both at Gauriganj and Chiraigaon were Thakurs, it was time the opposition stopped labelling her anti-Thakur, she pointed out. ""I am not against any particular caste and have only targeted criminals irrespective of their religion or caste,"" she said.

Claiming to be the only UP chief minister who had toured each district, the CM said that she did not believe in judging official claims of development work sitting in the room.

""Things have improved,"" she said, ""and now officials have begun sitting in their offices from 10 am to 12 noon everyday. But they are still not paying much heed to public grievances"". This was evident by the number of complaints she received during her tour, she said. ""Officials in the state,"" she said, ""are thoroughly spoilt and it will take some time before they reformed their ways.""

The CM also read out the list of suspended officials which included two district magistrates and three CDOs, among others, and said the problems of cane farmers could be solved if the Centre allowed the UP government to fix the support price. ""Give me a free hand and I will sort out the issue within 24 hours,"" she declared.

15,United India launches new 'Unimedicare' policy,"CHENNAI: United India Insurance Co Ltd posted a premium income of Rs.2970 crore during 2002-03 and the target for this year is a 12 per cent growth to this income, a top executive of the Chennai-based company said on Saturday.

The investment income of the company during 2002-03 was Rs.650 crore, as against Rs.550 crore in the previous year, V Jagannathan, Chairman and Managing Director of UI, said, while launching ''Unimedicare policy'', a new product from its repertoire.

He said this ''customer-friendly'' policy, covering medical expenses arising out of hospitalisation, is available at 30 to 35 per cent cheaper than the regular Mediclaim premium. ""It is tailor-made to suit the lower and middle income group of people.""

Jagannathan said the United India had opened nearly 100 ""micro offices"" to sell its policies, like the mediclaim, personal accident policies.

""This year, another 200 such offices will be opened in different parts of the country,"" he said, adding these micro offices, set up in villages with a population of 50,000, or a cluster of small villages, will be manned by only one person.

16,Nagaland minister sacked,"KOHIMA: In a sudden development in Nagaland, Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio on Saturday night dropped Housing and Homeguards Minister E T Ezung from his four-month-old ministry without citing any reason.

An official notification issued by Chief Secretary R S Pandey said Governor Shyamal Datta on the advice of the Chief Minister ""terminated the appointment of Ezung"" with effect from Saturday.

When contacted, E T Ezung, elected to the assembly from Bhandari constituency in Wokha district on a NDM(H) ticket who joined the Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) government, said, ""I was not even given a hint by the Chief Minister about the decision. I am happy with the decision and will serve my people as MLA and senior party leader.""

When asked to throw light on Rio''s the sudden decision, Ezung said ""perhaps the Chief Minister took the decision to accommodate some of the MLAs, those who resigned from his Congress ministry.""

Earlier in the day, four months after suffering electoral reverses in the state, the Congress received a jolt with seven of its MLAs breaking away and forming the ''Nagaland Congress''.

The MLAs, including four former cabinet ministers in the S C Jamir government, chose the former NPCC vice-president, Kaito, as president and former youth resource minister, Wangyuh Konyak, as the general secretary.
