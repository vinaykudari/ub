2,Uproar in House over Rabri statement on 'chief ministers',"PATNA: The Bihar assembly had to be adjourned on Tuesday after complete chaos and anarchy prevailed in the House over the statement of chief minister Rabri Devi recently in which she had stated that there were six chief ministers in Bihar.

She had named the high court, Supreme Court, governor, Speaker of the assembly and chairman of the state legislative council as the other chief ministers of the state.

The uproar started at zero hour when several BJP MLAs asked the Speaker Sadanand Singh about the fate of their privilege motion served against the chief minister. Singh stated that the notice had not come before him. The NDA MLAs were on their feet and a section of the BJP MLAs rushed into the well of the House raising slogans and demanding the resignation of the chief minister.

Leader of the oppposition Sushil Kumar Modi stated that the chief minister had lowered the dignity of the House by casting aspersions about the Speaker and also other constitutional institutions.

The ruling party MLAs were on their feet protesting against the remarks made by Modi against the chief minister. Parliamentary affairs minister Ram Chandra Purbey insisted that the chief minister never made any derogatory remarks against any constitutional posts. â€œOur party honours democratic and constitutional institutionsâ€�, he remarked, charging the BJP with showing disrespect for the Constitution and other institutions.

Amidst chants of slogans and counter-slogans, the Speaker asked the chief minister to make a statement. Rabri Devi stressed that she respected the House and the Speaker and had not said anything against anyone. â€œThe paperwalas have presented my statement in a distorted formâ€�, she remarked.

Her statement, however, failed to satisfy the opposition benches and the noise and disorder continued, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House almost 50 minutes before schedule. The matter figured again during the post-lunch session in which there was a sharp exchange of words between Rabri Devi and Sushil Kumar Modi on the issue when the chief minister reiterated her stand.

3,All-party delegation asks Centre to hold rly bifurcation,"NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: An all-party delegation from West Bengal on Tuesday petitioned the Centre to put on hold the railway ministryâ€™s plan to bifurcate zones, warning that the move would trigger parochial passions.

Leaders and senior legislators from all parties except the Trinamul Congress first met railway minister Nitish Kumar and pleaded that the creation of new zones would have a serious bearing on national integrity since the railways had come to symbolise the countryâ€™s unity.

They later had a meeting with deputy prime minister L.K. Advani and urged him to ensure that the Railways were not ""regionalised"" by dismantling the present structure. Advani assured the delegation that he would take up the matter with PM Atal Behari Vajpayee after defence minister George Fernandesâ€™ return from abroad.

While defending his decision to create new railway zones as per the railway Act, Nitish Kumar, however, told the delegation that it was his ""responsibility"" to communicate the concerns of the Bengal legislators to the PM.

""The creation of new zones is not a mere technical matter; it has social, economic and political dimensions as well; the railways integrate the country,"" delegation leader and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty told at a press conference.

He said that it would be a disastrous move to bifurcate the railways zones keeping the specific interests of some states in mind.

He, however, insisted that the political parties in Bengal were keen to avert any ill-will or confrontation with neighbouring Bihar. Breakaway Trinamul Congress leader and former Union minister Ajit Panja claimed: ""Certain implications of the bifurcation move, it seems, were not known to the railway minister."" He stressed that the bifurcation would create a huge administrative problem for the railways.

CPM MP and chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on railways Basudeb Acharya pointed out all the committees concerned had opposed the creation of new zones keeping in view the financial burden they would place on the railways. ""The last railway zone â€“ South Central â€“ was created way back in 1965.

""At todayâ€™s costs, it would require Rs 500 crore to make one zone functional,â€™â€™ Acharya pointed out.

Congress leader Gyan Singh Sohan Pal said Advani had agreed that new railway zones would create ill-feeling among different states.

Interestingly, Trinamul Congress, the main Opposition party in the state, was not part of the delegation.

Meanwhile, the all-party delegation from West Bengal, returned on Tuesday.

Stressing on the financial losses that the state would incur, members of the delegation argued that the bifurcation was not justified.

Besides 16 MLAs, seven MPs were part of the delegation. Saugata Roy of Trinamul, however, went to Delhi on his own.

4,MLAs unhappy with govt schools,"HYDERABAD: The city MLAs seem to be an unhappy lot because the government is not doing much for the schools in their constituencies.

All India Majlis-Ittehadul Muslimeen floor leader and representative of Charminar constituency Asaduddin Owaisi said they completely supported the state governmentâ€™s proposal to achieve 95 per cent literacy by 2004.

â€œBut how can children study when there are no buildings, blackboards or proper schools?â€� he said, adding that there were about 20 schools in his constituency. Despite several representations to the school education department officials, Asaduddin Owaisi said that no action was taken.

N Indrasena Reddy of Malakpet is unaware of how many government schools dot his constituency. â€œBut they are in a good condition,â€� he said. Commercial Taxes Minister and MLA of Khairatabad K Vijayarama Rao said he was touring the schools in his constituency. â€œI have the list of schools at my office,â€� he said, when asked about the number of schools in his area and what condition they were in.

Asifnagar MLA D Nagendar said of the 16 schools in his constituency, 10 were dilapidated. â€œThey have no buildings, one of the schools is now a gamblersâ€™ den,while a part of another school was demolished during roadwidening,â€� he said.

Chandrayangutta MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi said that all the 11 schools in his constituency are in a â€˜horribleâ€™ condition. â€œNo funds were sanctioned for their development,â€� he said.

MLA of one of the oldest areas of the city â€” Yakutpura â€” Mumtaz Ahmed Khan said there were approximately 25 schools in his area. â€œThis area is one of the most backward areas of the city, and there is an urgent need to increase the literacy rate of this area to improve its condition,â€� he said. â€œBut there has been nothing more than promises,â€� he added.

School education minister Mandava Venkateswara Rao said the government would construct new school buildings this academic year and improve infrastructure.

6,Omar denies agreeing to imposition of Central rule,"SRINAGAR: Union Minister of State for External Affairs and president of Jammu and Kashmir''s ruling National Conference on Wednesday denied that his party had agreed to imposition of President''s rule in the state in the run up to the coming Assembly elections.

Strongly refuting the comments in this regard attributed to him by a newspaper from New Delhi, Abdullah said that imposition of President''s rule would amount to running roughshod on Constitution and was also against democratic precedents of the country.

""We welcome appointment of independent observers, introduction of electronic voting machines and any other reform to ensure a free and fair election but we will not be a party to anything that runs counter to constitutional provisions and democratic norms,"" he said

Addressing a public meeting at Shahampora in downtown Srinagar, Abdullah, lashed out at the out at the tendency to call for imposition of Central rule.

The Union minister said it does not enhance the credibility of Indian democracy and could raise uncomfortable questions about the entire system and the rule of law in the state.

Even some ""signboard parties"", who hardly have any existence in the state have joined the chorus for this untenable demand, he said making it clear that the only scenario in which Governor''s rule could be imposed was after the recommendation to that effect by the state government.

Abdullah said the 1996 assembly elections were held under President''s rule. ""How could we have rigged those elections to sweep the poll and gain an unprecedented majority,""? he asked.

He said the people of the state do have certain grouses against the Central government but ""we will agitate only through constitutional and democratic means.""

""Gun culture and violence have no role in our struggle and would not lead us anywhere,"" he said, adding, ""even the champions of violence were now trying to return to the mainstream through electoral exercise.

""While this is a welcome development but people would be right in asking whether the heavy price they were made to pay during the last decade was at all worth the exercise,"" the NC chief said.

7,Maharashtra govt agrees to buy DPC power,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra government on Wednesday decided to resume offtake of power from the troubled Dabhol Power Company''s 658 mw phase one at Rs 2.25 per unit, but Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)-led financial institutions may not accept the proposal citing that the price is too low.

""FIs may not be in a position to accept the government''s offer primarily because the rate of Rs 2.25 per unit quoted is far too low. We may have to reject the proposal"", a senior FI official said here.

He said contrary to the state''s ""temporary"" solution, the IDBI-led FIs are trying to find a permanent solution to the DPC imbroglio, in which their funds up to Rs 6,200 crore have been locked.

""We are told they are also not ready for a fresh power purchase agreement. How can a power company sell power to any utility without a PPA? In any case, this price is too low for a project like DPC which unlike NTPC has been given no concessions"", the official said.

Currently, the DPC''s lenders both Indian and foreign, are struggling to find a buyer for the plant, which has been lying idle for over a year now since MSEB stopped buying power from it and rescinded the PPA.

""We have no clue as to how they have arrived at the figure, as one has to compute several factors like global oil prices, now moving in a USD 22-26 per barrel band, the fuel adjustment cost and other factors that are a part of the per unit cost of the power purchased"", he said.

8,The finance minister's new men,"NEW DELHI: ""It''s good that the new appointments in the Finance Ministry has happened a good seven to eight months before the Union Budget. That leaves the new look team ample time to prepare for the next Budget"". This is how a CEO of a well-known software company reacted to the new appointments in the North Block.

The government on Tuesday announced the appointment of S Narayan, an Indian Administrative Service officer of the 1965 batch - belonging to the Tamil Nadu cadre - as the new Union finance secretary and secretary, department of economic affairs.

Narayan, who was earlier revenue secretary, succeeds C M Vasudev, who is joining the World Bank. The new finance secretary had joined the Finance Ministry as revenue secretary in November 2000. Prior to that, he had held important positions as secretary, Ministry of Petroleum (joined in October 1999) and also secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development and Public Enterprise. Narayan had been a secretary in the Coal Ministry as well.

""The new finance secretary is an old industry hand. Therefore, he will be no stranger for the industry chambers as well as the market. I hope he builds a lasting partnership with the new Finance Minister Jaswant Singh,"" said an office-bearer with a leading industry chamber.

The new revenue secretary, Ajai Vikram Singh, is a 1967-batch IAS officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre. Singh, who till now was special secretary, defence (procurement), had joined the Defence Ministry in June 2001. Prior to that, he was chief secretary of Uttaranchal.

The government had also appointed D C Gupta, special secretary, department of personnel and training, as the secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs within the Finance Ministry. The post had been abolished during Yashwant Sinha''s stint as finance minister as part of the efforts to downsize the government.

Gupta is a 1967 IAS officer of the Orissa cadre. Before being appointed as the special secretary, department of personnel and training in the Labour Ministry, he was the additional secretary in the same ministry.

Between December 1997 and May 1999, he served as the Director General in the Employees State Insurance Corporation, also a part of the Labour Ministry. Gupta, like Narayan, is also no stranger to the Finance Ministry. Between 1991 and 1996, he had worked as a joint secretary in the department of expenditure.

Amid these appointments, there is speculation that Jaswant Singh may appoint former finance secretary Vijay Kelkar as a special advisor to the Finance Ministry, acting as a strategist to help devise ways of implementing economic reforms. There are also talks that former revenue secretary and Planning Commission member N K Singh will be brought back.

Meanwhile, it is understood that the two ministers of state, Gingee Ramachandran (revenue) and Anant Geete (banking, insurance and expenditure) too will be swapping their portfolios.

10,GU seeks police protection for principals,"AHMEDABAD: Principal bashing, which has emerged as a trend among student leaders seeking admission for their favourites, has made Gujarat University sit and take notice and even seek police protection for all principals, till admissions are over.

The university on Wednesday wrote to the police commissioner asking for such protection. This letter is in reaction to the beating up of Gujarat Arts and Commerce College principal NP Chauhan by one Bharat Patel on Tuesday.

But this is not the first time that a principal has been manhandled on the issue of granting admission. Last year, for instance, principal of HA Commerce College CB Raval was roughed up. J D Acharya of C U Shah Arts College, Ahmedabad was manhandled by a self-proclaimed student leader, again for refusing admission. The list of similar incidents is a long one.

So what makes principals such an easy target during the admission time? In Chauhan''s case, there have been many allegations that admissions used to be granted at a price. Bharat Patel, who was accused of beating up Chauhan, too, has alleged that the tiff was a fallout of Chauhan''s refusal to return the Rs 8,000 given by two students seeking admission in Gujarat College.

""Over the years, we have received many verbal and anonymous complaints but not a single complaint with proof"", a top GU official told TNN. Not that GU can do much as the university has no powers to punish a state government employee.

Otherwise, the problem stems from the fact that student leaders run a parallel business of giving admission to students in well-known colleges charging a hefty fee. ""But taking law in one''s own hand is just not done"", says pro VC Chaitanya Khambolja.

11,DPS principal may have been target of crude bomb,"NOIDA: The â€˜â€˜crude bombâ€™â€™ that exploded outside the entrance to the Delhi Public School principalâ€™s office, could have caused more serious casualties, the police said here on Wednesday.

The target could have been the school principal Neena Sehgal, the police added. She had just stepped out of her office to go for assembly, when the bomb went off. She escaped unhurt, but the schoolâ€™s estate officer Meher, who was walking beside her, sustained splinter injuries on his arm. He had to be rushed to hospital. The blast, which took place at 7.40 am on Tuesday, left one student and three staff members injured.

Sehgal could not be contacted, but a school official confirmed that Meher was accompanying her when he was injured. According to a bomb squad official in the Provincial Armed Constabulary, Om Pal Singh Rana, â€˜â€˜The bomb was capable of killing someone if they were close enough. It was what you call a sutli firecracker, similar to the â€˜atom bombsâ€™ let off during Diwali. It had a gunpowder encased in threads. Unlike other firecrackers, it contained small stones as shrapnel, but no metallic objects, like nails.â€™â€™

Rana told the Times News Network that the bomb had to be thrown to explode. On impact, the friction with the stones caused the igniting spark. The shrapnel caused most of the damage. He said the bomb could not have been made by a student. â€˜â€˜It needed technical expertise,â€™â€™ he siad. District police chief Rajiv Krishna agreed that the principal was â€˜â€˜the probable target of the bomb.â€™â€™
