0,"Builders everywhere, no government","GURGAON: In 1997, advertisements promising a green and ultra-modern city lured Sanjay Kaul into shifting to Gurgaon from his rented house in Saket. The independent marketing consultant had hoped life in this new city would be better than what Delhiâ€™s messy environment offered.

But soon after shifting to Sushant Lok, Kaul realised the perils of moving to an upcoming suburb without infrastructure. Five years down the line, he feels even more cheated by those advertisements put out by builders.

Kaulâ€™s world is now inhabited by many devils he thought he had left behind in Delhi. There are power cuts, a terrible water shortage. The roads are full of potholes. There is no public transport to speak of. Garbage lies around in front of glitzy buildings where software and export companies have their offices.

The Haryana government seems to have abdicated all responsibility and handed over Gurgaon to builders.

Now as high-rise after high-rise comes up, the future of Gurgaon itself is in question. Not least of the problems is the absence of security. Residents complain of harassment by wayward policemen on duty.

â€˜â€˜The developers realised thereâ€™s more money in selling apartments than plots. So now we see high-rises coming up all over,â€™â€™ says architect S K Das, who lives in DLF Phase-III. â€˜â€˜Today, almost 21 cinema halls in five to six multiplexes and seven shopping malls are coming up on a stretch of four km.â€™â€™

The government, it seems, has no idea about whatâ€™s going on. Asked about the number of high-rises, Gurgaon DC Anurag Rastogi said: â€˜â€˜Nobody will have those kind of figures.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Gurgaon people have paid to get the infrastructure in the form of external development charges. For example, a person who bought a 200 square yard plot here would have paid about Rs 7,000 as external development charges,â€™â€™ said H N Handa, convener of the federation of Gurgaon resident welfare associations.

The Society for Urban Regeneration of Gurgaon (Surge) and several other residentsâ€™ associations have gone to the Haryana High Court, asking the state government what it has done with the development charges which run into hundreds of crores of rupees.

â€˜â€˜We have asked how much money did the government collect under this head. How much has been spent and what is the plan for the balance?â€™â€™ said Surge honorary president and former foreign secretary J N Dixit. â€˜â€˜If you make promises, fulfil them.â€™â€™

2,Slowdown won't hit LIC's investment plans: Mathur,"MUMBAI: Life Insurance Corporation of India''s (LIC) investment plans for the current fiscal ending March 31, 2003 would remain unaffected despite the prospects of industrial and economic slowdown due to drought conditions.

The investment outlay of LIC for industrial sector was just 10 per cent of investible funds and there would be very little impact of drought on investment plans, LIC''s chairman designate S B Mathur said here.

According to Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) norms, ""we invest 50 per cent of funds into government securities and 15 per cent in infrastructure sector"", Mathur said.

Faced with substantial reduction in the interest rates, LIC would have to step up its activity in the secondary market - equity and debt - to earn higher returns on its investments, Mathur said.

LIC would have full-time chairman after almost a gap of six months. Mathur would take charge of the office from current in-charge and managing director N C Sharma on Friday.

3,Power failure greets ministers,"GUNTUR: Even as the government has announced freedom from power cuts from August 15, power supply went off in several areas in the city on Thursday. The breakdown occurred when ministers Kodela Sivaprasada Rao and J R Pushparaj were at the Takkellapadu sub-station to inaugurate the 24 hour-power supply feeder.

There was no power in several parts of the city from 11 am to 12.30 pm. Officials of the Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (SPDCL) attributed the power cut to a transformer failure in Kothapet limits.

In addition to the power cut in Kothapet limits, there was no power at the Takkellapadu sub-station for a while as there was a technical snag in the Gunadala feeder from where power was drawn to the city on Thursday.

Normally, Guntur city gets power via Tadikonda feeder, but due to a breakdown at there, the transmission was diverted from the Vijayawada thermal power station to the Gunadala feeder.

The power was transferred from the Gunadala feeder to Guntur via the Tadepalli feeder.

There was a break down for few minutes at the Gunadala feeder exactly at the time when minister Kodela was at the sub-station to launch the 24-hour power supply.

Meanwhile, Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh had installed 865 single-phase transformers in addition to the existing and 128 km of 6.3 kv line in the district to ensure 24-hour power supply to all villages of the district.

According to information, Guntur circle would supply five lakh units of additional power for the purpose.

4,"FIEO sacks DG, who terms it unlawful","NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Export Organisation (FIEO) has terminated its DG Ranjit Lal. However, Lal refused to accept the decision, terming it unlawful and an act of victimisation. FIEO has been witnessing infighting for over a year during which KK Jain was ousted as president and the latest development could snowball into a major controversy with Lal writing to members of the managing committee for support. S S Patodia who succeeded Jain as president of FIEO along with members of the managing committee served a termination notice to the DG saying they were not satisfied with his performance. Lal said that he had not accepted termination order as it had been issued without prior consent of the managing committee and cited no reason as to why his services were being terminated. Lal said he had requested a meeting of the managing committee to intervene in the matter and allow him to express his views on the issue. According to sources, Lal told the members of FIEO managing committee that he was being victimised.

5,Dasmunsi demands govt's reaction in Shivani case,"NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader P R Dasmunsi on Friday demanded a reaction from the government following allegations against two senior ministers in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case and said if he was in the position of Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan, he would have resigned to facilitate an impartial enquiry.

""It is not an individual''s issue but a collective one and it is for the government to react as the wife of the absconding prime accused in the murder case has alleged instigation by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and involvement of Mahajan,"" Dasmunsi said.

Stating that he was speaking in his personal capacity, he said if he had been in place of Mahajan, he would have resigned till investigation in the case was over.

Taking a dig at Advani, he said it was most unfortunate that the Deputy Prime Minister, who often boasts of fighting terrorists, has been unable to apprehend the absconding police officer R K Sharma, the prime accused in the case. ""What is the mystery behind all this? Sharma is not an Al Qaeda terrorist,"" he said.

6,"J&K polls a challenge, says official","SRINAGAR: The election machinery in Jammu and Kashmir has geared up for ""the most difficult assembly polls since Independence"" with revision of electoral rolls, increased security arrangements and addition of 1,000 new polling stations, Chief Electoral Officer Promod Jain said on Friday.

""The coming elections are the most difficult since Independence,"" Jain said at a crowded press conference here.

""Taking cognizance of complaints that electoral rolls have not been comprehensively revised since 1987-88 elections, we undertook a massive revision of the rolls and added 300,000 voters,"" he said.

""The Centre has granted adequate security forces and we have decided to provide security to district presidents or secretaries of all political parties to ensure level playing field,"" Jain said.

The CEO said around 4,000 officers have been requisitioned from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab for deployment at polling stations during the four-phase polls.

Polling stations which had been clubbed due to security reasons during 1996 elections have been declubbed and 1,000 more added, Jain said adding the total number of stations now stood at 7,025.

""The new polling stations have been set up in areas where the number of eligible voters has exceeded 1500 or the distance to the nearest polling station exceeds two kilometres in hilly areas and three kilometres in plains,"" he said.

Jain said around 2000 political stations have been classified as hypersensitive and 1000-1500 as sensitive. ""We have made adequate arrangements and are in the process of finalising (deployment of) paramilitary troops at these stations to ensure smooth election process,"" he added.

Jain said various measures have been taken since January to ensure larger participation and smooth conduct of polls.

The revised electoral rolls have been put up at 8000 places across the state including the polling stations, Deputy commissioner''s offices, ''tehsil'' and ''niyabat'' offices.

Jain said training in operation of EVMs was going on at full pace and more engineers were being brought for technical support during the elections.

He said Election Commission of India had recommended the transfer of deputy commissioner of Poonch district ""for not properly implementing the commission''s directives.""

The order to this effect would be issued in a couple of days, the CEO said.

Jain ruled out polls being delayed to accomodate any separatist elements who might want to join the fray as the time table has already been issued.

7,Congress flays govt on ER bifurcation issue,"KOLKATA: Congress on Friday criticised the Vajpayee government for not taking any step to defuse tension in the neighbouring states over the bifurcation of Eastern Railway and demanded that the Prime Minister should discuss it with the chief ministers of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa.

The party also demanded that the Centre form an expert committee to dispassionately examine the decision to bifurcate the railway before implementing it from October one.

Pilloring the NDA government, West Bengal Pradesh Congress President Pranab Mukherjee said when resolutions were passed in both West Bengal and Bihar Assemblies on the bifurcation and when provincialism raised its head, Vajpayee should have taken some step against it.

The veteran Congress leader, addressing a public meeting organised by his party to protest the bifurcation, said the Prime Minister should discuss it with the chief ministers of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa.

Mukherjee, a former union minister, said that a cabinet decision on the division was not sacrosanct and could be altered. Many cabinet decisions in the past were changed, he said.

Referring to the movement by the Trinamul Congress against the bifurcation, the CWC member ridiculed the party for equating it with the Partion of Bengal in 1905. ""The two issues are not the same. But what can we do if they distort history.""

9,"Shabir Shah ready for peace, not polls","SRINAGAR: Calling themselves the messengers of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, a delegation of the Kashmir Committee, headed by Ram Jethmalani, met senior separatist leader Shabir Shah on Friday.

The delegation is on a three-day visit to the Valley to convince separatist leaders to take part in the assembly elections.

The first leader they met here on Friday maintained his stand against the polls. Even as Shah accepted the talks offer, he said elections should not be held until a breakthrough was achieved.

Asserting that Kashmir was the core issue between India, Pakistan and Kashmiri people, Shah said he had called for a purposeful dialogue as he had done during the earlier talk with K C Pant, the government interlocutor last year.

He said the government should prepare grounds for a meaningful dialogue to instil trust in people here. Shah said, â€˜â€˜I have told Ram Jethmalani to put a stop to human rights violations, to release the detainees lodged in jails for the last 12 years, besides repealing the laws giving powers to security forces like Disturbed Area Act and Special Arms Act.â€™â€™

Accepting the message for talks with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, Shah said violence could not settle disputes. â€˜â€˜After September 11, 2001, the world situation has changed,â€™â€™ Shah said.

Talking about elections, Shah said elections were part of the democratic process. We have to participate in such democratic process sooner or later but the resolution of core issue needs to be addressed, Shah said.

Meanwhile, talking to mediapersons at a press conference later, Jethmalani sounded hopeful. He said they had not reached a deadlock and talks would continue to work out an amicable solution.

Reiterating that they had come to solve the Kashmir issue, Jethmalani said Shah expressed his concern for the people of J&K.

Other members of the seven-member delegation are Dileep Padgaonkar, M J Akbar, Ashok Bhan, V K Grover, Shanti Bushan and Javid Layeeq.
