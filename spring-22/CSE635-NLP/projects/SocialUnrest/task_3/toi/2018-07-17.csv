0,Parties gear up for civic body polls,"pune: even as the fear of dissolution looms large over the pune municipal corporation (pmc) in the light of action taken by the state government recently over former municipal commissioner arun bhatia's charges, political parties are gearing up for the polls, scheduled to be held early next year. the shiv sena held a meeting of its activists at ganesh kala krida manch on saturday. besides, other political parties are also planning to organise a series of programmes in the next few months in this regard. the sena meeting, which was addressed by the party's youth leader uddhav thackeray is seen as an attempt to mobilise the party machinery for the forthcoming pmc elections. according to reliable sources, saturday's meeting was the first in the series of meetings, camps and workshops to be organised on city and assembly segment levels. uddhav's presence at the meeting also assumes significance considering the recent comments by sena chief bal thackeray exhorting his nephew raj thackeray to concentrate on drawing cartoons at the moment, instead of indulging in politics. the development is being seen as an attempt to project uddhav as the second-in-command. the bjp, too, does not seem to be lagging behind its partner. the party has declared to hold a protest march under the leadership of former deputy chief minister gopinath munde to the pmc on july 21. the party has planned the march to push their demand that the portrait of rashtriya swayamsevak sangh founder keshav baliram hedgewar is not removed from the pmc. a senior bjp leader said the congress had provided them with an opportunity by raking up the issue of installation of the portrait. ""by doing so, they have ensured that all the organisations in the sangh parivar firmly stand behind us in the forthcoming civic election,"" he said. the leader also said that at the ward level, bjp activists, along with activists from organisations belonging to the sangh parivar, are meeting local corporators and giving them memorandum on the portrait issue. ""this exercise is helping us bring greater co-operation and co-ordination among all the organisations from the parivar at the grass-roots level."" according to sources, last week senior bjp leaders from the state met all the city and district unit office-bearers and elected representatives from western maharashtra to chalk out the strategy for the forthcoming elections to zilla parishads, municipal councils and municipal corporations. the ruling congress party was the first to start its campaign around two months ago with the party's city unit president mohan joshi meeting local corporators, party activists and people in various wards in the city. the party in the city is also organising programmes to bring about interaction between the state and national party observers and other prominent leaders. however, all this seems to have suffered a setback with mr joshi away on long tour to the us. to make matters worse, the key party leader and rajya sabha member suresh kalmadi too is yet to play an active role in the local party activities. the fourth largest group in the pmc, the nationalist congress party, seems to be lagging behind in the process. the only major programme in recent months the party organised was a rally to welcome its state unit president babanrao pachpute, who was on a state-wide tour.

1,CPM tries to give clean chit to transport minister,"kolkata: the cpm is all set to give a clean chit to its controversial transport minister subhas chakraborty on the salt lake issue. the mindset of the party was spelt out on monday when cpm state secretary anil biswas said that the minister could not be held responsible if some criminals took shelter at the stadium. the scandal over arrest of criminals from the youth hostel of yuva bharati krirangan last month that rocked political circles in kolkata was expected to come to an end on thursday when chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee would issue a statement on the issue at the floor of the assembly, based on the report of cid inquiry. cpm sources revealed during the day that the cid investigation had absolved the transport minister of the charges that he was linked with the underworld and had used criminals to rig the recently held assembly polls. cpm central committee member nirupam sen, too, had said at burdwan on sunday that a vice chancellor could not be held responsible if a student was found indulging in criminal activities inside the campus. ""what nirupam has said is correct. he is a central committee member of our party,"" biswas said. ""it is not the job of a minister to look after who is entering the stadium premises,"" biswas added. the cpm state secretary, however, refused to go into the details of the incident saying merely that the police were investigating into the case and the chief minister would say, whatever was to be said on the issue. party insiders claimed that the hardline cpm leaders had made up their minds to nail chakaraborty on the issue and clip his wings. but they began to have second thoughts when the controversial minister went on the offensive and hinted that he would ""expose"" several other top leaders of the party.

5,CPI blames CPM for govt's poor performance,"kolkata: the pre-poll slogan of giving an unnata bam front (improved left front) is all set to boomerang on the cpm. the cpi, a major constituent of the front, has held the cpm ""mostly responsible"" for failing to give a ""dynamic, corruption free and pro-poor government"" during its 24-year rule. the state executive committee and the state council of the cpi, which are preparing a report to outline the modalities of improving the performance of the government, feel that as the dominant partner of the nine party left front, the cpm needed to mend its own ways to ensure improvement in the performance of the left front. the cpi will submit its report to the left front next month. a state executive committee member of the cpi told toins on monday that his party felt that the cpm, on many occasions, had failed to take a pro-poor stand. as a result, the state government deviated from its declared policy of giving priority of serving the poor of the state. ""the state government has so far failed to enact a law to safeguard the interests of agricultural workers. the pro-landlord tenancy law, being mooted by the cpm, is also not to our liking,"" the cpi leader said. the cpi also felt that as the dominant partner of the front, the cpm must take the blame for growing corruption in different sectors of the administration. ""we had promised a corruption free administration. since the cpm controls most of the government departments both at the state and the district levels, the onus falls on it to explain why the evil is growing,"" the cpi leader said. the front constituent also felt that as a part of the state government's effort to improve work culture, it was necessary to modernise its offices and do away with their shabby look. performance of a government employee was also influenced by the atmosphere in the office he or she was working in, the front partner felt. in its report, the cpi has also planned to blame the cpm for its pursuing a big-brotherly attitude towards its partners. the cpm should give up its practice of functioning alone at the grass-roots levels and instead should allow others to form left front committees at the lowest levels.

7,'Zest for life increases with knowledge of vedanta',"hyderabad: ""zest for life increases with knowledge of vedanta,"" says susheelaji, a senior disciple of swami parthasarathy of the vedanta life institute, mumbai. advancements in science has changed the face of the world, but individuals do not find peace commensurate with progress, susheelaji, said in an interview to the times of india. a post-graduate in bio-chemistry from mumbai, y susheela, who had dedicated two decades of study, research and propagation of vedanta, said unless the true meaning or the essence of life was discovered, the lacunae or the incompleteness in life would prevail. ""this cannot give eternal happiness,"" she said. happiness is dynamic, it changes as a human being grows from childhood to adulthood. for a toddler the sight of the mother gives all happiness and then by material objects like toys, tricycle, bicycle and the quest for knowledge to earn material wealth and prosperity. in that effort, man becomes more dependent on nature, she said. ""a sudden tragedy can shake his inner poise. the same objects which he had admired turn out to be an object of hatred,"" she said. sensuous objects cannot give lasting happiness. human beings though cannot be free from feelings but should maintain their inner poise and that can be attained from vedanta, she said. susheelaji said looking back down the ages, the country was highly spiritual as the accent was on teaching of vedanta. in the gurukula system that existed a child was taught from the age of eight on two aspects - worldly knowledge or science and the other the philosophy of life or vedanta. when the child becomes an youth, he becomes educated attaining worldly and spiritual knowledge. ""but today education has become lop-sided,"" she said. she will deliver her lectures on vedanta and chapter iv of bhagavad gita with the theme ""live by choice, not by chance"" at the bharatiya vidya bhavan, basheerbagh from july 16 to july 19, from 6.30 pm to 8 pm.

11,"Stalin's close associate, family commit suicide","chennai: a close associate of chennai mayor m k stalin committed suicide along with his wife and three children on monday. a note, reportedly written by the associate, ramesh, in tamil, claimed that he had taken the extreme step as his image was being spoilt by a complaint filed against him. the note, recovered by the police, referred to the bribery complaint by a contractor against stalin and former highways minister t. kirutinan in which ramesh's name also figured. former dmk mp k. parasuraman has already been arrested in the case. the complaint was made by the contractor, deivasigamani, who alleged that a bribe of rs 6 crore was paid to stalin and kirutinan through ramesh to get the road maintenance contract. this was also mentioned by tamil nadu chief minister j. jayalalitha in the assembly on may 29. according to the police, juice mixed with some insecticide killed ramesh (38), his wife kanchana (28) and three daughters - monica (10), sharmila (nine) and bindu (11 months). the note reportedly mentioned that he was being harassed by the police who threatened to arrest him under the narcotics act. however, city police commissioner r. muthukaruppan said ramesh was neither questioned nor searched by them in connection with the complaint. ramesh was known to be the right-hand man of stalin. according to a police release, a packet of insecticide and soft drinks were seized. they had rushed to the posh anna nagar house on a complaint from ramesh's brother. the release also claimed that the investigation was on to determine whether ramesh's note was genuine or whether he forced to take the extreme step by another party.

12,BJP launches backward classes quota politics in UP,"new delhi: political equations are being reworked in uttar pradesh in the months before the assembly elections over the state government's promise of a job quota for the most backward castes. the ruling bjp's efforts to gain political mileage from the recent announcement will get underway on tuesday when union ministers uma bharti and ram vilas paswan join chief minister rajnath singh at a public meeting in lucknow. in an apparent attempt to divide the backward classes and win over a section of them, the bjp has planned a campaign on the issue of the mbc quota. the lucknow show, billed as a thanks-giving meeting, is, in fact, seen as a prelude to the poll campaign. the presence of bharti, one of the most prominent backward politicians in the bjp fold, will clearly acquire unmistakable political overtones. she has reportedly been instructed by her party leadership to get active in the up campaign apparently to offstage the negative impact of former chief minister kalyan singh's expulsion on the backwards. when contacted, bharti admitted as much. ``yes, i am going to campaign extensively in up,'' she told this paper. the opposition camp, however, feels that an overkill on the mbc quota issue is sure to backfire. ``a section of the backwards among whom the bjp has significant support, might veer away from the party as a reaction to the new quota politics,'' former prime minister v. p. singh remarked. the castes he declined to mention in this context, seem to be the lodhas and kurmis. singh who as prime minister had accepted the mandal commission report on obc reservations, interestingly felt that the economic issues were going to determine the political agenda in the coming years. ``the up elections will be a test case for the new kind of politics,'' he remarked. the samajwadi party which has done well in the recent by-elections in the state, sees chief minister rajnath singh's announcement of the sub-quota as an expression of ``desperation.''

14,Thiyam gives up Padma Shri in protest,"new delhi: to protest against the ``apathy of the government at the centre'', theatreperson ratan thiyam has relinquished the padma shri that was bestowed upon him in 1995 for creating plays which have become benchmarks of excellence in the world of theatre. in a letter to president narayanan, the director of anti-war plays like chakravyuh, uttar priyadarshi and hiroshima has said ``manipur has suffered for years due to the lack of attention from the centre''. in particular, the government has been ``just a silent observer'' to the violence that has rocked the state following the extension of the naga ceasefire ``without territorial limits''. due to this decision, ``so many young lives were lost, the state is burning, the daily wage earners are forced to starve, and my work is in suspended animation'', thiyam, who was in the capital for a sangeet natak akademi meeting, has said. stating that the only ``contribution'' of the state is ``the intimidating presence of para military forces'', thiyam has further objected to the ``apathy'' since ``even common political development elsewhere sends the centre into a spin''. elaborating that his act of relinquishing the padma shri ``is not a disrespect for the civilian honour but a compulsion of my bleeding heart'', thiyam has expressed the hope that it will prompt the centre to ``exhibit its democratic will and withdraw all provisions which affect the territorial integrity and interest of manipuri people''.

19,Doctor gets police cover after shooting incident,"mumbai: the police have provided protection to sunil shah, a city doctor, following a firing incident at his bungalow on shahid bhagat singh road in juhu on sunday. two unknown persons, believed to be from the fazl-ur-rehman gang, fired two rounds at his bungalow before making good their escape on sunday morning. dr shah who was woken up by the firing rushed to the main door but the assailants had already made good their escape by then. ``dr shah informed the police that he was threatened by the fazl-ur-rehman gang for extortion last week,'' a senior officer stated. ``we have registered a complaint and provided him with a police guard.'' the police are trying to zero in on members of the fazl-ur-rehman gang. two of them were shot dead in an encounter by unit i of the crime branch some weeks ago. ``rehman is based in dubai and controls the activities of his gang over the mobile phone,'' an officer stated. the police suspect that he is in league with underworld gangster abu salem. meanwhile, police sources stated that a few other doctors had also received extortion threats from underworld gangs recently. the sources added : ``extortion is on the rise in mumbai. with the presence of several smaller underworld gangs like that of faz-ur-rehman, guru satam and ali budeshi, each one is trying to out do the other by targeting as many affluent persons in mumbai as possible.'' among the bigger gangs are those of chhota shakeel, abu salem and chhota rajan. the targets include film personalities, businessmen, builders, hoteliers and traders. police statistics reveal that until last year, it was the chhota shakeel gang which was more active in extortion activities. this year, however, the police received a maximum number of complaints against the chhota rajan gang. with most of the underworld gangs facing a financial crunch, they are believed to have become desperate to knock out money from even small-time traders and shopkeepers, police sources said. in a bid to crack down on these gang members and tackle the growing extortion menace, the police department recently started three additional anti-extortion cells in mumbai. these cells have been set up at worli, ghatkopar and in andheri. according to this year's statistics, the police registered 106 complaints against the rajan gang and 90 against the shakeel gang. but the actual number of extortion cases may be more than five times this figure, sources pointed out. according to police sources, several directors, producers and actors in the film industry were still receiving threats from the abu salem and chhota shakeel gang. recently, the salem gang threatened film actor amrish puri for an extortion amount of over rs 1 crore. about 12 actors and actresses have been asked to cough up in excess of rs 10 crore from these gangs, police sources said.

22,Bio-tech policy needs swadeshi touch: Report,"bangalore: a study report on karnataka's millennium biotech policy has called for harmonising investment programmes of information technology (it) and biotechnology to attract investors to the state. the study, conducted by the institute of parliamentary affairs, has suggested that the policy be revised, enlarged and improved so as to become the draft policy for the national agenda on biotechnology. a team of 30 experts, including professors from state universities who have compiled the report, have stressed on the need for including indigenous thinking in the policy, now branded as a `western-oriented one'. the report, while lauding the state government's initiative in promoting biotechnology, has come down heavily on various loopholes in the biotech policy. ``the policy has failed to avail the services of the heads of agriculture, industry, health, animal husbandry and other departments which deal with the needs of biotech industry clients, including farmers. besides, the policy hasn't recognised that the competition is not on an equal footing between mncs and indigenous firms,'' experts have said. stating that the policy has failed to appreciate the role of universities in providing training and laboratory facilities for promoting development at the grassroots, the report outlines the need for introducing integrated biotechnology courses in universities so that trained biotechnologists will be available for the biotech sector. the policy, the study has found, hasn't provided for proper and effective coordination among the term-lending institutions, banks and venture capital companies which could result in duplication of their functions. ``the policy does not address issues like bio-safety and intellectual property rights.'' further, the possible problems arising from the patent issues haven't been addressed adequately and has borrowed ideas from the western biotech policies, rather than giving priority to domestic needs. the policy hasn't defined the application techniques of biotechnology for helping the poor, thereby defeating the whole purpose of biotechnology being a tool for development, the report notes. experts have, however, suggested measures to correct the anomalies: * the policy will have to spell out the role of financial institutions, including the world bank, in respect of biotech companies. there should be compulsory funding from these companies for training biotechnologists. * introduce integrated bio-technology courses in universities and as part of the curriculum at the degree level. * involve more scientists, professors and experts in the committees formed for promotion of biotechnology. * a cell to promote interaction between universities and the biotech sector be set up to enable effective implementation of the policy.

23,Oppn puts govt on the defensive over drought,"bangalore: there was pandemonium in the assembly on monday with the opposition seeking to move an adjournment motion against the government for its failure to take steps to tackle the drought situation. when opposition leader jagadish shettar sought to move the motion, speaker m.v. venkatappa said it could be taken up after question hour. at this, the entire opposition was on its feet demanding that the question hour be postponed and the motion be admitted. ``when the whole state is reeling under drought, what is the urgency to discuss some questions? the government owes a reply to us on why steps were not initiated when monsoon failed this year,'' shettar declared. despite repeated requests from the government and the speaker, the opposition were unrelenting in its demand. ``you should make a noise, if the government has refused to discuss the issue on the floor of the house. we are merely telling you to postpone it,'' home minister mallikarjun kharge said. after a 45-minute heated argument, an angry speaker said: ``the drought situation is not going to change in one hour. question hour will be taken up first.'' later, making his preliminary submission on the motion, shettar said the government should utilise the centre's ``food-for-work'' scheme to the maximum extent. ``five lakh tonnes of foodgrain worth rs 500 crore will be given either free or at half the economic cost as payment for developmental work in drought-prone areas. about 1.5 lakh tonnes of cattle-feed quality grain will be given for free for fodder and the state should make full use of this additional resource,'' he maintained. janata dal (u) floor leader p.g.r. sindhia wanted to know why the secretary-level nodal officers, appointed by the government, hadn't submitted a report on the drought situation to the government. ``were they just a publicity gimmick?'' he asked, adding that none of the deputy commissioners in the state had even toured all taluks to find out the ground-level problems. sindhia said chief minister krishna should put pressure on the centre, similar to what the andhra pradesh and orissa cms did during the cyclone to get funds. ``we have 28 lok sabha mps and 22 rajya sabha mps, along with union ministers, who should all put pressure. but the essential problem is that karnataka has failed to state the seriousness of its case properly, as the government does not even have figures to back them,'' he alleged. comparing the present situation to the 1971 drought, when people in north karnataka migrated in large numbers to mumbai, goa, pune and hyderabad, sindhia said the drinking water and power situations in the state were equally desperate now. ``at least rs 100 crore should be released just for drinking water within the next two months and the karnataka power transmission corporation should immediately stop its disconnection drive, for the village panchayats to be able to pump water,'' he pointed out.

24,Parties gear up for civic body polls,"pune: even as the fear of dissolution looms large over the pune municipal corporation (pmc) in the light of action taken by the state government recently over former municipal commissioner arun bhatia's charges, political parties are gearing up for the polls, scheduled to be held early next year. the shiv sena held a meeting of its activists at ganesh kala krida manch on saturday. besides, other political parties are also planning to organise a series of programmes in the next few months in this regard. the sena meeting, which was addressed by the party's youth leader uddhav thackeray is seen as an attempt to mobilise the party machinery for the forthcoming pmc elections. according to reliable sources, saturday's meeting was the first in the series of meetings, camps and workshops to be organised on city and assembly segment levels. uddhav's presence at the meeting also assumes significance considering the recent comments by sena chief bal thackeray exhorting his nephew raj thackeray to concentrate on drawing cartoons at the moment, instead of indulging in politics. the development is being seen as an attempt to project uddhav as the second-in-command. the bjp, too, does not seem to be lagging behind its partner. the party has declared to hold a protest march under the leadership of former deputy chief minister gopinath munde to the pmc on july 21. the party has planned the march to push their demand that the portrait of rashtriya swayamsevak sangh founder keshav baliram hedgewar is not removed from the pmc. a senior bjp leader said the congress had provided them with an opportunity by raking up the issue of installation of the portrait. ""by doing so, they have ensured that all the organisations in the sangh parivar firmly stand behind us in the forthcoming civic election,"" he said. the leader also said that at the ward level, bjp activists, along with activists from organisations belonging to the sangh parivar, are meeting local corporators and giving them memorandum on the portrait issue. ""this exercise is helping us bring greater co-operation and co-ordination among all the organisations from the parivar at the grass-roots level."" according to sources, last week senior bjp leaders from the state met all the city and district unit office-bearers and elected representatives from western maharashtra to chalk out the strategy for the forthcoming elections to zilla parishads, municipal councils and municipal corporations. the ruling congress party was the first to start its campaign around two months ago with the party's city unit president mohan joshi meeting local corporators, party activists and people in various wards in the city. the party in the city is also organising programmes to bring about interaction between the state and national party observers and other prominent leaders. however, all this seems to have suffered a setback with mr joshi away on long tour to the us. to make matters worse, the key party leader and rajya sabha member suresh kalmadi too is yet to play an active role in the local party activities. the fourth largest group in the pmc, the nationalist congress party, seems to be lagging behind in the process. the only major programme in recent months the party organised was a rally to welcome its state unit president babanrao pachpute, who was on a state-wide tour.
