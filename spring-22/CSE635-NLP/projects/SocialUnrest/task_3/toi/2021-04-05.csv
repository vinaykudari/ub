0,Blood's thicker than politics,"VADODARA/RAJKOT/SURAT: When Varun Gandhi expressed displeasure at the derogatory remarks made by Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi about his aunt and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and cousin Rahul on Saturday, he proved one thing â€” blood is thicker than politics.

Like the Gandhis, Gujarat has its own share of politically divided families. Vaghodia BJP MLA Madhu Shrivastav and Vadodara Municipal Corporation Congress corporator Chandrakant Shrivastav alias â€˜Bhattuâ€™ are cousins who have frequently switched parties and even contested as Independents.

But when it came to the infamous Best Bakery case, Chandrakant, who was accused of intimidating the complainant Zaheera Shaikh, stuck like glue by his cousin, Madhu, who allegedly influenced the witnesses into turning hostile. The case made history and so did the kinship.

â€œPolitics never becomes an issue in our discussions and neither of us tries to impose his views on the other,â€� Chandrakant says. He adds that the ties between the two families are so strong, that, â€œwhen it comes to family and personal matters, politics takes a backseatâ€�.

At Rajkot, a staunch RSS leader Chiman Shukla who re-joined the BJP last year, is at ideological loggerheads with daughter Kashmira Nathwani, a Congress supporter.

â€œWhenever I discuss ideology with my father, he tries convincing me that the Congress lacks ideology and then we argue about the foreign origin of Sonia Gandhi,â€� says Nathwani. She says that they have reconciled to living with different ideologies.

Suratâ€™s veteran Congressman, Purushottam Liliawala, was happy when his son Jayesh followed his footsteps and is now the general-secretary of the Congressâ€™s Surat city youth wing. But the jolt came when the other son, Vipul, opted for the BJP. He is now an active member of its youth wing and is learning the fine art of politics from BJP MLA Dhirubhai Gajera.

When asked about differences in the family on political issues, Jayesh admits that at times consensus eluded their discussions and, as a result, things took an ugly turn. But then, â€œfamily ties being strong, political differences are never allowed to reach damaging proportionsâ€�, he says.

Not many know that Congress candidate for the Dahod Lok Sabha constituency, Prabha Taviad, has a brother who is with the BJP. Her brother, Babubhai Damor, is an orthopaedic surgeon and an active member of the BJP. Taviad says that she does not discuss politics with her brother. â€œThat is his personal preference,â€� Taviad says.

1,New govt could hold key to IIM tangle,"AHMEDABAD: Even as round one in the IIM-HRD ministry fracas has gone to the former, preparations have begun for the next stage of the battle. This will be fought at the negotiating table, away from the mediaâ€™s glare.

Talks are already on to set up two negotiating teams â€” one comprising IIM Board members and IIM Society representatives and another consisting of government officials. These two committees, after finalising their own positions, will sit across the table.

But the two teams will come face to face only after a new government is in place at the Centre. â€œIt will be a long, protracted negotiation. Even if Murli Manohar Joshi is not the next HRD minister, the issues he has raised will have to be answered,â€� admitted a don.

He and many of his colleagues said they were â€œrelievedâ€� but â€œstill apprehensive that things might never be the same again because autonomy goes much beyond the issue of who has got the right to determine feesâ€�. Moreover, in negotiations, there has to be some â€œgive and takeâ€� â€” which means that the IIM would have to give up something.

Dons aver that since no government, minister or bureaucrat ever hands over control easily, the HRD ministry will not give up without a fight. The only change will be that HRD ministry officials might conduct themselves in a civilised manner.

Joshi has been contending that since the Government of India is one of the promoters of IIMs, it has a say in the running of the institution, including in the process of the CAT.

This is especially so because IIM-A has been getting grants for capital expenditure from the Centre, Joshi has been arguing.

The feeling on the campus is that the fee issue can be settled by either having a two-tier fee structure or by increasing manifold the financial provisions for needbased scholarships, so that anyone in need of assistance can be given a hand.

But, at the same time, the ministry could go on chipping away at the faculty-based administration system. This system allows departments to make appointments and take major decisions, including deciding matters of admission.

Analysts agree that much will depend on the fragility or otherwise of the coalition that will take office. A government with a good majority might not try to make an issue out of the IIMs, but a motley coalition would be tempted to indulge in rhetoric.

Dons have noted that no leader from within the government tried to restrain Joshi even as he went on the rampage. This, they attribute to the powerful words unleashed by Joshi that the faculty was busy earning money through consultancy even as boys and girls from underprivileged families could never hope to make it to the IIMs.

The last round was primarily won because of the skills shown by NR Narayanamurthy and his prime advisor, MS Banga of Hindustan Lever.

The duo, using track-II diplomacy, were quietly able to convince the government to see reason. They were also â€œhelpedâ€� by the intemperate behaviour of joint secretary, VS Pandey, whose rough ways were not appreciated in the government. Dons feel that much of what would happen now was dependent on the continued efforts of Narayanamurthy and Banga.

5,'Professor' flaunted political muscle,"NEW DELHI: Hotel owners in Karol Bagh area of the city say that Satvir Singh - the absconding owner of Regent hotel, from where nine Azerbaijani call girls were picked up on Friday - was a bully who would liberally drop names of politicians to further his interests.

""He publicly claimed that he was close to a top Haryana leader. His Regent hotel had many visitors from the state,"" said the manager of a hotel in Karol Bagh.

""It''s a fact that Singh knew the politician''s son well, but nothing can be said with certainty as yet,"" said a police officer.

The 55-year-old Singh, fondly called ''professor'' by his aides is currently said to be hiding somewhere in Haryana.

Residents of the area agree with Singh''s claim that he was politically well-connected. ""He was frequently seen hobnobbing with the staff of Haryana police in the area. He used them to throw his weight around,"" said a hotel owner.

Police admit that Singh owned several properties all over Delhi. ""It seems he had stake in other properties in Paharganj and even in south Delhi. He also owns around eight-nine luxury cars,"" said a police officer.

The officer said the police found his home in Vasant Kunj locked when they went there to arrest him.

Singh reportedly made Rs 200 crore by employing call girls from Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.

6,Hear two Atals speak at PM's rally,"LUCKNOW: Lucknowites will get an opportunity to hear two ''Atals'' during BJP''s Bharat Uday rally on Monday.

One would be the well known voice of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the other would be that of Lucknow University research scholar Shailendra Sharma ''Atal'', whose voice and oratorical skills are strikingly similar to that of the PM.

People address him as ''Mini Atal''. But he calls himself a diehard Vajpayee fan. He is master of Vajpayee ishtyle speeches delivered with those ""long pauses"" and ""satirical narrative"" and has a ""deep insight"" into the topic.

Sharma has a hectic schedule ahead of this Lok Sabha election. BJP candidates not only in UP, but also in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan have already booked him as a ""star campaigner"".

""Atalji has inspired me since childhood and I inherited oratorical talent from my grandfather, Brij Nath Sharma, who was a freedom fighter,"" he said.

Sharma has been involved in BJP''s campaign since 1991. He was a member of the Lucknow University team which won, three times in a row, the ""National Youth Parliament Award"", sponsored by ministry of parliamentary affairs, by beating 93 universities.

Sharma had played the role of PM, ie Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ""People are attached to Atalji. One can attract them by copying him. But can anyone make them listen for hours only by touching their sentiments? This is only possible when the person has knowledge about local issues, demography, caste configuration and has a deep insight into political events,"" he said, adding, ""I have to work on all these factors before a speech.""

There have been numerous occasions when people have mistook him as Atalji''s relative. In Bhopal during Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, local BJP workers were so impressed that they asked him to contest for LS from there.

On another occasion the spontaneous reaction of some teachers was, ""Atalji speaks like you,"" he recalled and added ""I had to tell them that it was vice-versa.""

Especially as till date IIM-A has been getting grants for capital expenditure from the Centre.

On Saturday, former RBI governor Bimal Jalan warned that ""unwarranted political or bureaucratic interference can cause permanent damage to an institution"". He stated this at the 39th annual convocation of IIM, Ahmedabad.

8,Factional politics behind Cong's decline in UP,"NEW DELHI: Almost all the pre-poll indicators, whether they are opinion polls or first-hand reportage, predict that Congress will not do well in Uttar Pradesh.

The issue is not of how many seats the Grand Old Party will get but of its near-terminal decline.

The story of the party as told by election outcomes is the following. In 1952, riding the crest of goodwill gained by the Independence movement, the party won 81 of 85 seats.

Its stellar candidates included Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and K D Malaviya.

The next snapshot is the 1967 election which foretold the decline of the Congress in the face of a middle-caste revolt. The party won just 47 of the 85 seats.

The titanic ""Garibi Hatao"" sweep of 1971 brought the party to 73 seats. But this only presaged the great disaster of 1977 when the party lost every seat in the state.

Among the losers were Indira Gandhi, her son Sanjay, K C Pant, Dinesh Singh, Shiela Kaul and a host of other minor stalwarts.

The victories of 1980 (51 of 85) and the sweep in 1984 (83 of 85 seats) was the last flutter of the darkness descending on the party in UP.

Analysts have traced the roots of the party''s weakness to the personal and factional politics that go back to the decades before independence.

At that time, freedom struggle kept things in check. Thereafter, they became a major factor in undermining the party.

First came the departure of the socialists from the party in 1948 and then, the defeat of the right wing led by Purushottamdas Tandon. The great champion of Hindi and unabashed votary of Hindu culture had been elected president of the party, but was forced out by Nehru.

The resultant hard secular line surrendered this political space to the Jana Sangh, and later the BJP which steadily grew and had become the second most important party in the state by 1962.

Despite all this, the party maintained its supremacy because of the personality of Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant who dominated state politics from 1937 till his departure to the Centre in 1955.

Thereafter, things started to fray. Dr Sampurnanand (1955-60), C B Gupta (1960-63) and Sucheta Kripalani (1963-67) failed to match Pant''s stature.

The Congress managed to retain power because it could cobble electoral coalitions, while the Opposition was disunited. Tenures became shorter interspersed with spells of Pres-ident''s rule.

There have been 26 chief ministers in 36 years since. Many like C B Gupta, N D Tiwari, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati have come back again and again.

The castle of sand that was the UP Congress collapsed because the upper caste leaders of the party refused to share power. From the outset, Brahmins dominated the state''s politics in a manner they have not done elsewhere. Then came the Banias and Thakurs.

The Mandal castes and Dalits were firmly kept out of the leadership.

The change began when Chaudhry Charan Singh, a Jat, walked out of the Congress, created a Samyukta Vidhyak Dal and formed the first non-Congress government in 1967. After that, there was the deluge.

Eleven of the 31 chief ministerial tenures have been led by Brahmins. Other well-to-do castes, Thakurs, Banias and Kayasthas have held another 10.

But since Mulayam Singh Yadav''s first term - December 1989 to June 1991 - just two upper castes have held office, the hapless Ram Prakash Gupta for a year beginning November 1999 and Rajnath Singh between October 2000 and March 2002.

All the other CMs have been OBCs or Dalits - Kalyan Singh, Mayawati or Mulayam.

9,Urban voters want to keep off politics,"NEW DELHI: In a survey conducted by TNS, respondents were asked if they would like to jump in and take the reins of politics to steer it on to a cleaner track. No, said more than 7 out of 10 respondents, they would rather get on with their own lives.

Voters in cities and towns overwhelmingly agree that good education is a necessary prerequisite for practitioners of good governance and other qualities like commitment to serving people and leadership follow.

Perhaps in a sign of cynicism that such a politician may not exist, honesty came in way lower in the qualities a good politician. Only a minuscule percentage said they should not be corrupt.

Very few also thought that birth in a political family gave politicians a major edge in leadership.

Most voters felt candidates with a background of social or military service or academics are likely to become better and less corrupt administrators, with a higher than average sensitivity towards the common people.

Surprisingly, the very stars of shining India - corporates and businesspeople - come in at the bottom of voter preferences for good leaders.

Most voters also say politicians should retire at 60 and not clog the pipeline for younger aspirants.

12,BSP rules out post poll alliance with BJP,"FAIZABAD: The BSP on Monday ruled out any truck with BJP in the post Lok Sabha poll scenario and said it would take a decision keeping its own interests in mind.

""A canard is being spread by some vested interests that the BSP may support BJP in government formation after the elections, this is quite wrong,"" BSP president Mayawati said addressing an election rally near here after filing her nomination papers.

""This much is certain that no government at the Centre would be formed without the support of the BSP,"" she said, adding she was confident that her party would emerge as the single largest party after polls as it was contesting in all 80 seats in the state.

Mayawati blamed both the Congress and the BJP for aiding and abating communal forces in the country and said as Congress was responsible for the ''shilanyasa'' in Ayodhya for temple construction in 1989, the BJP was responsible for demolition of Babri mosque in December 1992.

It was strange that the Congress government at the Centre at the time of demolition remained silent spectator and said the Congress could not escape from shouldering the responsibility of demolition despite its professed secular policy.

Alleging the Samajwadi Party of following the footsteps of the Congress in strengthening communalism, she reminded the Muslim folks not to forget ""these facts"" in coming the Lok Sabha elections.
