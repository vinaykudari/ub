0,Vineyards make way for farmhouses,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad suburbs were once known for vineyards. Gone are those days, when people travelling on the highways used to enjoy the sweet breeze from the vineyards.

The Anab-E-Shahi, the favourite variety of yesteryears is no longer available in the market. The thriving real estate business and the pressing need for land for housing have eaten up the vineyards near highways. In some cases, farmhouses are coming up as more and more people have taken to them.

According to a conservative estimate, vineyards on at least 1,000 acres have been converted into farmhouses or used for constructing apartments. This is happening at a fast pace at Shamshabad, Medchal and Kompalli areas of Ranga Reddy district. While an international airport is supposed to come up in Shamshabad, resorts and entertainment places have come up at Medchal and Kompalli.

â€œYes! The gardens near highways have been converted into farm houses. But, farmers are moving to interior areas and growing grapes,â€� says C Kanaka Reddy, president of Andhra Pradesh Grape Growers Association.

Speaking to The Times of India, sugar and horticulture minister P Narayanaswamy Naidu said the government has taken stock of the situation and contemplating necessary steps.

When asked about Anab-E-Shahi, Reddy said, â€œIt is ra3rely grown nowadays. People prefer the green seedless or capsule variety.â€� According to Yousuf of Anwar Fruit and Juice Centre in Himayatnagar, the flame variety was the most favourite one two years back but now Kala Shahi (seedless) or Black Beauty and capsules (green seedless) are the most preferred varieties.

On the other hand, there is a rise in grape exports from the state particularly from Ranga Reddy, Mahabubnagar and Medak districts. At the same time there is a drop in production also.

â€œThere is a decline in production. But the quality of the grapes has improved. Farmers are growing more export quality grapes nowadays,â€� said a horticulture department official. About 20 per cent of the production, approximately one lakh tonnes, is exported to UK and other European countries from the state, Kanaka Reddy said.

Small and marginal farmers are taking up grape cultivation. They undertake training at National Research Centre for Grapes at Pune. The farmers are adhering to European standards, Reddy added. There are about 8,000 to 9,000 acres under grape cultivation in Medchal, Shamirpet, Keesara, Maheswaram and Shamshabad.

There were only 5,000 acre grape gardens in Rangareddy district five years ago. While seedless grapes are grown in Rangareddy, Mahabubnagar and Medak districts, seeded variety are grown in Anantapur and Chittoor districts.

1,"JU students, cops clash over water","KOLKATA: Students of Jadavpur University fought pitched battles with the police on Tuesday morning after an old dispute over water sharing sparked off a row with families of policemen.

The son of a cop allegedly beat up a research scholar, prompting the students to lay siege to the Jadavpur police station.

The students virtually muscled the police into arresting the alleged attacker, Laltu, whose assault apparently left the scholar with a perforated eardrum.

Faced with chronic water shortage, boarders of the JU main hostel have been entering the adjacent police quarters for two years now to collect water from a KMC tap.

There were minor altercations during this time. On Tuesday, the students allegedly broke the queue in their haste to take water. Students, however, claim the policemenâ€™s families abused them and threatened to beat them up. During the argument, Laltu beat up Shibaprasad Das.

Students immediately marched to Jadavpur police station. â€œWe called Laltu who profusely apologised for the incident. But the students kept insisting for legal action. Laltu has been arrested,â€�

DSP (Town) Humayun Kabir said. Das was treated at EDF hospital. Doctors suspect his ear drum was perforated. As the news spread, more students marched to the police station accusing the cops of being lenient on Laltu because he was a colleagueâ€™s son.

The police had to use force to break up the protest. â€œWhat else could we have done under the circumstances?â€� Kabir said. JU registrar Rajat Bandopadhay said they would consult an ENT surgeon on Dasâ€™s injury.

On the acute water shortage, the registrar said that they had already paid a work deposit of Rs 7 lakh to the PWD for a pipeline to bring in water from Garden Reach.

â€œBut the KMC has given us an initial cost estimate of a whopping Rs 8,000 per day,â€� he said. â€œWe have written to MMiC Sobhan Chattopadhay to provide an alternate arrangement, till we meet the mayor and ask him to scale down the costs.â€�

2,"Azhar joins politics. Or, does he?","HYDERABAD: Idle celebrities are finding that they are grist for the rumour mill this election season. The latest personality to whom political ambitions are being attributed is Mohammed Azharuddin, who, news reports had it, is being considered for the Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat by the BJP.

This, he said, was news to him â€” stale news at that. â€œI donâ€™t know how this rumour has arisen. These reports are completely false. I donâ€™t want to be dragged into an unnecessary controversy,â€™â€™ he told The Times of India.

Banned from cricket, he has been minding his business by running a fitness centre named est, and finalising plans to start a cricket academy in Hyderabad.

But this was not the first time that the former India captain has been rumoured to be considering a political innings. Three years ago, when he was beleaguered by allegations of match-fixing, he was rumoured to be joining the Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen.

An appearance at an iftar hosted by MIM patriarch Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi fuelled the story. With him now being linked to a party at the other end of the political spectrum, the story can be said to have come a full circle.

3,Cop wives protest pay cut,"KOLKATA: Wives of policemen on Tuesday stepped out of the Midnapore police lines and shot off a letter to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

They were protesting against the West Midnapore SPâ€™s decision to deduct a dayâ€™s salary every month for eight months in aid of the families of personnel killed in the Belpahari blast.

This comes two days after they pleaded vehemently with the SP not to send their men without proper training and firepower to fight the Naxalites.

In a departmental order, SP Praveen Kumar informed that all police, NVF, home guard and ministerial staff would give a dayâ€™s salary for eight months from February for the eight policemen killed.

Terming the decision as illegal, the policemenâ€™s wives claimed the SP had no right to deduct salary for such a long period without their consent.

â€œThough we sympathise with the families of those killed, we cannot be intimidated to pay what we cannot afford,â€� one said.

They appealed to the chief ministerâ€™s good sense and apprehended that if such an incident happened again, they might be forced to pay more.

The SP, who was not available for comment, had written that he hoped his men would rise to the occasion.

He added that people willing to pay more could do so.

Soon after the order was received, there were muted protests from several quarters, culminating in Tuesdayâ€™s action. The wives, many believe,were egged on by their husbands who did not dare to revolt openly against the SPâ€™s order.

State home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said, â€œIf this is true, it is the SPâ€™s own decision. The state government has no direction in this regard.â€�

He said the state had already announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 2 lakh for each victim.

â€œThe SP has to send a proposal first, but the process would be expedited,â€� he added.

5,PW members clash with jail officials,"PATNA: Trouble broke out in the Beur jail on Tuesday morning when a group of prisoners manhandled a warder allegedly on the issue of â€œextracting money from a visitorâ€�.

But IG (prisons) Ravikant said that the trouble started when Peopleâ€™s War (PW) leaders, Arvind and Ajay Kanu, and other members of the Naxal outfit insisted on meeting visitors together.

When jail officials said â€˜noâ€™, the prisoners got involved into a scuffle with them and, therefore, force had to be applied to control the situation, he said. He denied that any prisoner was injured in the incident. The wards of the PW members were changed later.

However, sources in the jail said that one prisoner called Ravi was involved in a scuffle with a warder trying to extort money from an inmate.

This led the jail authorities to ring the danger bell and around 25 inmates were rounded up thereafter.

â€œMost of them were PW sympathisers,â€� the sources said.

The sources also indicated that the inmates were mercilessly beaten up by the jail warders and at least three inmates sustained head injuries. PW leader Arvind was reportedly also injured. The injured were being treated in the hospital inside the jail, the sources said.

â€œPW sympathisers alleged that the jail authorities deliberately targeted them because they had launched an agitation recently against poor basic amenities in the jail,â€� the sources said.

Meanwhile, the Daman Virodhi Morcha has condemned the alleged lathicharge on the jail inmates, including PW leaders and Maoists of Nepal, by the administration of the Beur jail.

The Morcha coordinator Bhuneshwar Singh alleged that the injured inmates were not being treated properly inside the jail.

6,Permit rules confuse customers,"MUMBAI: One doesnâ€™t need a permit to drink or possess beer. But permits are issued to those who have completed 25, and only they can drink hard liquor.

This beer allowance has brought cheer to young tipplers who frequent beer haunts. Sashwati Gosw-ami, Mondegar regular, said, â€œI donâ€™t drink hard liquor at all.

But when the ban on drinking without a permit was announced, I thought even I would have to get one. Hey, itâ€™s nice to know that I donâ€™t need one any more.â€™â€™

However, Hoshang Yezdagardi, managing partner of Cafe Mondegar, told TNN that news of the permit had thrown his customers into confusion.

â€œI have my regulars calling in to ask whether they require a permit. I have advised them to go to the Old Customs House,â€™â€™ he said. Mr Yezdagardi pointed out that since his cafe does not serve hard liquor, even under-21s could enter.

â€œWe donâ€™t have a dance floor and we are not governed by the Foreign Liquor Rules or Prohibition Act,â€™â€™ he said. â€œSo, we are not troubled by recent developments.â€™â€™

7,Paradigm shift in IT laws’ recognition: Experts,"CHANDIGARH: Do uni-dimensional laws of the physical world significant in the virtual world? Well, the acceptance of symbols like @ (at the rate of), .(dot), www (worldwide web), .org (domain) and the digital signature in day to day functions denotes a paradigm shift in the recognition of the information technology laws operating through the man-machine interface leading into the cyber world, say experts.

""See, a computer today is not merely a computing equipment, it actually is a powerful tool in cyber space. Power of one computer in the wired world is the power of all the connected computers,"" said Vakul Sharma, a Supreme Court lawyer and an expert in cyber laws while talking to Times News Network.

Explaining his point, Sharma said that the digital signature was becoming the functional equivalent of the handwritten signature. This shows the expansion of the web world, where technology drives business models, he said. ""Cyber space takes the place of the geographical space, citizens become netizens and the tangible becomes intangible when instead of buying a music CD you download music from the net,"" he added. ""How can the law lag behind?,"" asks Sharma.

Quoting Nicholas Negroponte who said â€” Moving bits is cheaper than moving atomsâ€” Sharma said that the cyber world is not a mere xerox of the physical world. ""It is a whole new world expanding before us which we cannot ignore,"" he said. Supporting his views, Dr KK Bajaj, Deputy Controller of Certifying Authority said that the main purpose of the IT Act 2000 was to establish trust in the electronic environment.

Explaining the difference between a digital signature and a hand written one he said that in the digital document there is no duplicate. ""Every thing is original,"" he said. Dr Bajaj said that digital signature is created through cryptography and works through the public key infrastructure (PKI) based on asymmetric keys. ""The public key is used to sign digitally while the private key is used to verify the identity of the user,"" informed Bajaj.

8,"12 injured as NCP, Sena workers clash","PUNE: The election fever seems to have set in with NCP workers on Monday clashing with former colleagues, who had quit the party to join the Shiv Sena, at Wadarvasti in Karvenagar, Kothrud.

The Kothrud police said 12 people were injured in the clash, of whom five were critically wounded. The police have arrested 48 people in the connection and two cases have been registered.

According to the police, the trouble started after Shiv Sena workers allegedly threatened NCP men residing in the Karvenagar area. The NCP workers later went to Wadarvasti, where the Sena workers reside, and demanded an explanation.

In the first complaint registered by Pramod Kondre, son of NCP corporator Vijaya Kondre, he has alleged that the Sena workers assaulted the NCP workers. The police said as many as seven NCP workers, including Kondre, suffered injuries.

In a cross-complaint, Senaâ€™s Vinod Mohite has alleged that the NCP men visited the area frequently to threaten them since they joined the Sena.

On Monday night, the NCP workers came to the area and started a verbal spat, after which they assaulted some Sena men, Mohite has said. The police said five Sena men suffered injuries.

Meanwhile, Vijaya Kondre has threatened to resign from her post and from the party claiming that no one from the party enquired about the incident.

11,I didn't talk politics with Arjun's son: Venkaiah,"BHOPAL: A day after veteran Congress leader Arjun Singhâ€™s son Ajay met him fuelling speculation about joining the BJP, Venkaiah Naidu denied they talked politics. â€œWe discussed water harvesting,â€� the BJP chief said on Tuesday.

""Frankly, it is unfortunate that such a rumour spread like wildfire. I want to clarify that he met me casually. When I was the Union minister for rural development, he was holding the same portfolio in Madhya Pradesh. And we actually did discuss water harvesting,"" Naidu said.

Corroborating Naidu, Singh said: ""I am a member of the Congress and I want to remain in the Congress.â€� â€œIf there was any conversation about leaving the Congress or joining BJP, why should we hide it? There is nothing to conceal,â€� said Naidu.

According to Singh, he had taken the appointment with Venkaiah Naidu three days before the meeting. ""If I had to go and discuss my joining the BJP, I would not have stepped out of my car outside his home and walked inside in full public view,"" he explained. â€˜

But Naidu was in a hurry, leaving for a meeting. ""I was inside the house for five minutes,"" Singh said. ""By the time I came out, the media had already rolled the story that I was in the BJP presidentâ€™s house for a political purpose.â€� Naidu confirmed that many Congressmen, apart from Rajya Sabha deputy chairwoman Najma Heptulla and former MP chief minister Digvijay Singhâ€™s brother Laxman, are expected to join BJP.

He said: ""Laxman kya, aabhi Ram bhi aayenge"" (Leave alone Laxman, even Ram will join the BJP). He even explained that Congressmen leaving the party was not an act of ""defection"" but ""affection"" for BJP.

Claiming that ""traditional hardcore Congressmen are leaving the sinking ship,"" Naidu said many Muslim Congressmen are keen to join the party.

""Persons from the Nehru parivaar (family) are joining the BJP. Digvijay Singhâ€™s brother has joined us. And a few more names are to follow, you will get to know of them soon,"" he said.

12,Unaided teachers to protest,"MANGALORE: The Karnataka State Primary Teachers'' Federation here would be organising a massive protest rally from UBMC Higher Primary School, Balmatta to the Deputy Commissioner''s office on Saturday urging state government to fulfil their demands pertaining to unaided schools.

Their main demands are: to bring unaided schools children under mid-day meal scheme ''Akshara Dasoha'', provide students with free uniform and text books and fee concession to girl students; provide medical allowance to teachers and give five per cent of the annual teachers salary as maintenance grant.

Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, Raviraj Shetty said they had formed the federation a month back as the government guidelines prevented unaided school teachers being represented in the Karnataka State Primary Teachers'' Association.

He said their other demands were: Provide continuing education programmes to teachers, give free education to children in the age group 6 to 14 years as done in government and aided schools, appoint teachers on the basis of student ratio and provide grants to all unaided Kannada medium schools.

Shetty said if the district is known for its education standards and high literacy levels, the credit should go to unaided schools. The government thinking that unaided schools are only for the rich is false as in unaided schools nearly 95 per cent students are economically poor.

K M K Manjanady, general secretary of the federation, said they would urge the political leaders to consider their demands sympathetically and remind them after the polls, as it was election time.

They have requested all unaided school teachers, parents and management to participate in the rally, along with students.

13,HP ministers assail Dhumal's remark,"SHIMLA: Education minister Asha Kumari and food and civil supplies minister Singhi Ram, in a joint statement have taken strong exception to the statement by former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, accusing chief minister Virbhadra Singh of being corrupt, undemocratic and unconstitutional.

Claiming that the outburst of Dhumal was due to the crushing defeat of the BJP in the last Vidhan Sabha elections, and also as he was seeing the writing on the wall as far as the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections were concerned, they reminded the former chief minister of the rampant corruption and nepotism during the tenure of the previous BJP government.

They said that the prevalent mass scale corruption and nepotism had not only been pointed out by the Congress, but the ministerial colleagues of the former chief minister, who had never withdrawn the allegations against their own cabinet colleagues.

The two ministers said that fearing exposure of the various acts of omission and commission committed by them when they were in power, the former chief minister and other BJP leaders were taking recourse to coming out with statements against the crusade launched by the Congress government against corruption in the state, for which it had been given the mandate by the masses.

They said that on the very first of taking office, Virbhadra had made it clear that while there would be no witch-hunting and political vendetta and the innocent need not be afraid, but those guilty of corruption would not go scot free, irregardless of their high office.

Claiming that transparency and responsive governance was the commitment of the present government, they said that the police force would not be used to indict political rivals in false cases, as had allegedly been done by the previous BJP government.

""The BJP leaders should not forget that Dhumal used the entire administrative machinery to register false cases against Virbhadra and other Congress leaders"", they added.

14,Misrule of BJP-BJD Govt main poll plank: Cong,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday said the five years of â€˜misruleâ€™ by BJP-BJD government headed by Navin Patnaik in Orissa as well as ""deterioration"" of law and order situation in the state would be its main poll plank during the forthcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.

""Nobody has benefited in the last five years. The India Shining propaganda is just an eye-wash to divert people''s attention from all round failure of the Government and the rapidly deteriorating law and order situation in the country and the State,"" former Orissa Chief Minister Hemanand Biswal, a special invitee to the CWC, told PTI here.

Biswal, here to participate in preliminary discussions on ticket distribution for the parliamentary and assembly polls, said Congress was on a strong position having pre-electoral alliance with Orissa Gana Parishad (OGP) and the Left parties.

Alliance with JMM, which has pockets of influence in the tribal areas of Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj districts, is being discussed at the highest level of the party, he added.

Biswal said Congress in alliance with these parties would be contesting all the 21 Lok Sabha seats and expected the party to return candidates to Parliament from at least a dozen constituencies. At present, Congress has just two MPs in Lok Sabha from Orissa.

15,Poll day clashes with entrance test,"NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) seems to be in a fix following the announcement of the general elections schedule. The polling date, May 10, is clashing with one of the dates on which the Board was to conduct its All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE).

While three papers of the AIEEE exams have been scheduled for May 9, the fourth paper is to be held on May 10. More than 4.5 lakh students are to appear for the exam this year across 600 centres in 102 cities including Dubai and Bahrain. The entrance exam forms the admission eligibility criteria for engineering, pharmacy and architecture courses being offered by a large number of institutions across the country.

The test is said to have become even more crucial this year in wake of the the University Grants Commissionâ€™s latest regulations. The UGC has declared that admissions to engineering, architecture and pharmacy courses at all universities in the country are to be made through AIEEE from the 2004 academic session.

With all other Sundays in May being already â€˜â€˜bookedâ€™â€™ by other entrance exams, Board officials seem to have been caught in a Catch 22 situation.

â€˜â€˜We can not prepone the exam as no Sunday is free. Postponing it beyond May 23 on which the IIT joint entrance exam is to be held, will create chaos as that is the time Board results are generally announced and university admissions start,â€™â€™ said a senior CBSE official.

Officials say that they are now virtually caught between the frying pan and the the fire.

â€˜â€˜The Board had announced its examinations dates a long time ago. Authorities at the election commission should have taken important examinations into account before drawing up the election schedule,â€™â€™ said said another official.

The fourth paper on architecture aptitude scheduled for May 10, is to be taken by more than 75,000 candidates.
