0,Failure to define law on privacy could cost society dear,"mumbai: the tehelka disclosures have spurred a growing debate among experts about whether invasion of an individual's right to privacy can be justified in the public interest. the supreme court has included the right to privacy as an essential ingredient of personal liberty. one of the relevant cases in the matter is the 1994 case of the publication of the so-called autobiography of notorious criminal auto shankar in the tamil weekly nakheeran, where the supreme court ruled that every citizen has the right to safeguard his\her privacy and that nothing could be published on areas such as the family, marriage and education, whether truthful or otherwise'', without the citizen's consent. however, there are two exceptions to this ruling. if, for example, the material sought to be published is based on public records, including court records, the right to privacy no longer subsists. secondly, in the case of public officials, the right to privacy does not apply in respect to conduct relevant to the discharge of their duties''. a part of the problem posed by tehelka's sting operation also arises from the fact that evidence, even if illegally obtained, is admissible in indian courts. in the the u.s., illegally obtained evidence (such as by breaching privacy laws) is inadmissible. however, legal experts say, the u.s. supreme court, in its 2000-2001 term, ruled that the press may not be held liable for publishing illegally intercepted information if the subject was of 'public importance' and the press had not participated in the interception. in the uk, on the other hand, there is no legal right to privacy. yet, even as debate on this issue has raged for the last two decades, the racier tabloids have continued to dish out salacious details on a host of celebrities. mr prabhu points out that the seemingly widespread support for tehelka's undercover operations in india stems from the fact that citizens are fed up with corruption and lack of transparency in officialdom, and are routinely denied information about the decision-making process. for instance, there are 21 clauses under which information can be denied to the citizen even under the maharashtra right to information act, making nonsense of the dictum that 'a little sunlight is the best disinfectant'. clearly, the law on privacy is still evolving in india and the disclosures made by tehelka only show that the time has come to define it more clearly. failure to do so, say legal professionals, will only serve to erase the line that separates the personal from the public, leaving society much the poorer for it.

2,Shops in Surat textile markets observe bandh,"surat: all the shops and trading houses in textile markets in the city remained closed on friday in response to a bandh call given by the federation of surat textile traders association (fstta) following death of a businessman - by cardiac arrest - in ratan market allegedly due to excessive harassment by the corporation's octroi officials on thursday. according to fstta president tarachand kasat, the octroi officials of the surat municipal corporation (smc) had unnecessarily forced the businessman, purushottam arora (51), to pay octroi charges for the goods he had brought to his shop from bhiwandi in mumbai. as per the rule, the smc has a fixed structure of octroi to be paid periodically on the goods brought from outside. since arora had stopped bringing the raw fabrics from mumbai and accordingly, he had informed the smc officials in writing about the same, the corporation officials, however, forcibly inspected his shop and asked him to prove that the goods kept there had not been brought from mumbai, one office-bearer of the federation said. despite repeated claims that the goods were not from outside, the smc officials remained adamant on their stand and asked for payment of octroi charges, which was a huge amount, sources in fstta informed. arora could not withstand this and suffered a massive cardiac arrest and subsequently he died in the shop, south gujarat texturisers association s s yadav said. hearing the news of his death, panic gripped the whole textile markets in the city on thursday evening, as many of them took the inspection as from the central excise department. soon a meeting was convened and it was resolved that all the shops would remain closed on friday, firstly as a mark of respect to the departed soul and also in protest against the highhandedness of the revenue officials, according to yadav. it may be noted here that for the last few days, the central excise department has been on an intensive combing spree in the city, causing worry to many in the trade circles. hence, the incident in ratan market on thursday was mistaken by many there, as the raids by the excise department were being conducted randomly, according to sources in the textile markets. as part of solidarity among the business community, the funeral procession of arora was marked by a huge gathering on friday morning. later during the day, office-bearers of fstta and other associations jointly held a meeting near ratan market and it was resolved that a memorandum be submitted to the corporation chief to restrain the octroi officials from such behaviour.

3,"CPM defends arrest, Opp. calls it vendetta","kolkata: both the trinamul congress and the party for democratic socialism have reacted strongly against the arrest of former dum dum municipality chairman sudhir bhattacharya on charge of the murder of his successor sailen das. on the other hand cpm state secretary anil biswas defended the arrest of bhattacharya stating that: ""police must have obtained concrete information about bhattacharya's involvement in the crime. the police are to confirm whether he had indulged in criminal activities or not,"" biswas said. bhattacharya, who had severed ties with the cpm in seventies, formed another marxist party. despite being hemmed in by the cpm, he managed to reign in dum dum municipality for more than 30 years. he was unseated by das only two years ago. by that time, he was accused of favouring promoters including his son who were part of the mushrooming construction business. lately, he was known to be close to the controversial cpm minister subhas chakroborty when latter was on the verge of leaving the party before the assembly poll. while pds leader samir putatunda alleged that bhattacharya had been framed at the instance of an influential zonal committee member of the cpm of dum dum, trinamul policy making committee chairman pankaj banerjee branded it as an evidence of political vendetta of the cpm against his party. ""the arrest of sudhir bhattacharya is unfortunate. it is a disgraceful incident of political vendetta. it is also an indication for the opposition to surrender before the ruling party. such a thing is unacceptable in a democratic set up, said banerjee. the cpm was hell bent on persecuting those who had defied the party diktat and also deserted the front, he said. bhattacharya was keen to contest the elections this time on a trinamul ticket and that he was framed as a consequence of this. banerjee said that bhattacharya was also instrumental in the cpm's defeat in dum dum in the last assembly elections. the seat was won by trinamul candidate arunabha ghosh who defeated cpm nominee ajit choudhury. both banerjee and putatunda said no one should be arrested on the basis of the confession of an arrested person. ""on the very day of the murder of sailen das, cpm zonal committee secretary bapi gupta had said that bhattacharya had a hand behind the incidnet. this is significant, putatunda said. he blamed inner-party feuds within the cpm for das' murder. ""it was a dispute between promoters and row over contractors' getting order for supplies which led to the killing. according to him, the same inner-party disputes led to the murder. ""why have ghosh's killers not been arrested? after the killing, ghosh's family members did not allow any of the cpm leaders to come anywhere near his body, putatunda said. according to the former cpm leader, a number of cpm activists had become involved in building construction and supply of materials. ""in 1995, we had taken a resolution in the south 24 parganas district committee of the cpm that no party member should be involved in such activities, but the same resolution could not be made effective for the party in the entire state. biswas ruled out a probe into some cpm supporters' role in this murder. after the murder, both biswas and chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee did not blame the opposition parties but hinted at the nexus between the politicians and realtors inside the party. however, bhattacharya's arrrest seemed to have changed the cpm leaderships's mood.

4,Employment exchange card must for govt jobs,"bangalore: thousands of job-hopefuls who have registered their names at the employment exchange, will have their sneaking suspicions confirmed: their applications have indeed been gathering dust all these years. it appears the state government itself has no faith in the agency. the result is that this nodal agency has been reduced to providing figures to the government on the number of unemployed people in the state. after the bad news, the good news. henceforth, a person selected for a government job will have to register with the state employment exchange to get the appointment letter. the move follows complaints that even government departments have stopped recruiting candidates registered with the exchange, though it is compulsory for the departments to seek applications from the exchange before vacancies are filled. the state directorate of employment and training has written to the karnataka government to make it mandatory for all those seeking jobs in government departments, through advertisements, to be compulsorily registered with the exchange. ""sadly, this is not happening. those who apply through advertisements are recruited. government departments do not even consider applications that are pending with the exchange. it looks as if the government itself is not interested in promoting locals in securing a government job,"" official sources told the sunday times of india. as a result, lakhs of applications are piling with the exchange for several years now. admitting that several lakhs of people who had registered with the exchange were waiting for years to secure a job, director of state employment and training n.s. narayana rao said: ""this move will ensure that people who have been waiting for several years are not denied job opportunities. besides, candidates from our own state should not be deprived of even applying for a government job."" in 1996, following a public interest litigation, the supreme court directed states to not only recruit candidates through employment exchanges, but advertise too, for vacancies in government departments. according to rao, whenever vacancies arise in government departments, the employment exchange sends a list of prospective candidates based on merit and seniority. a list is prepared and candidates are recruited. ""no requests come to us now. so applications are piling,"" he said. even recruitment of primary and middle school teachers through the exchange __ a practice for over two decades __ stopped two years ago. but those in the government departments fall back on the familiar argument: that shortage of humanpower and time have forced them to adopt this policy. ""we do take applications from the exchange, but then it is difficult to process so many applications. through advertisements alone, we get thousands of applications for a single vacancy. sorting out this itself takes time,"" sources contended. perhaps, the new rule will see applications moving at least at a snail's pace.

5,Subsidies retarding investment process in agriculture,"new delhi: drastic reduction in subsidies, reorientation of investment and review of archaic laws are some of the steps to boost rural demand so as to meet an eight per cent gdp growth, an expert said on sunday. ""the slowdown in technological development and the fall in public investment in agriculture in particular, are worrisome, even if private investment has been buoyant,"" national council of applied economic research director general suman bery said in a special publication on j r d tata brought out by assocham. if these trends in public investment continue then it would be very difficult to realise the natural comparative advantage in the agricultural sector and raise the levels of income in rural india, he pointed out. investments in technology, input use efficiency and rural infrastructure are crucial for long-term growth of indian agriculture, he said. further, the shift in consumption pattern from cereals to non-cereals such as dairy products, fruits and vegetables suggests that the focus of agricultural research and investment in the rural sector would have to be reoriented in favour of regions which have the potential, bery said. demand in the rural market for various products were increasing at a much faster rate, especially in comparison with the urban market. the share of rural markets in products like bicycles, mechanical wristwatches, radios and black and white televisions was about 75 per cent, he added.

6,High investment in fisheries fails to yield results: CAG,"new delhi: an investment of over rs 3 crore for development of reservoir fisheries in maharashtra by union agriculture ministry has not fructified due to inadequate project appraisal and ncdc admitted shortfalls, comptroller and auditor general (cag) said in its report. even though the envisaged completion period of the integrated reservoir fisheries development project (irfdp) had expired, only rs 3.19 crore (60 per cent) of the sanctioned assistance was released and the benefits envisaged were not achieved, it said in its report on autonomous bodies. irfdp to be set up at akola and bhandara in maharashtra with financial assistance from the centre by march 1998 was still incomplete and shortfall in achievements ranged from two to 100 per cent in both places, it said. the report stated that investments in the project had not fructified because the national cooperative development corporation (ncdc) overlooked many factors which had a bearing on the viability of the project. soil analysis which was essential for determining the fertility and productivity of fish reservoirs and water retention was not conducted. ncdc's appraisal was based on secondary instead of primary data. citing instance it said reservoir morphometry, water residence time, physio-chemical characterstics of water and soil were not obtained from central institute of capture fisheries and research institute. a scrutiny of the minutes of the deliberations of one of the meetings of the state level coordination committee also revealed that realities paramount to the project's success were overlooked. ncdc accepted that it had not received permission from maharashtra government's irrigation department for installing fish screens and handling sheds which was necessary for stocking of fish catch, the cag report said. due to the non-receipt of permission and short repayment period the component for fish screens and fish handling plants could not be utilised, it added. in terms of fish production the shortfall was 70 per cent and 56 per cent respectively in akola and bhandara. in terms of income for fishermen the shortfall was 59 and 61 per cent. ice plants could not be set up in either of the two places. there were also significant shortfalls in case of components like cages, fishing boats, drag nets and kiosks. while the project utilised 60 per cent of its sanctioned assistance amounting to rs 3.19 crores from the total rs 5.66 crore, ""it failed to achieve the intended results,"" it said. this indicated that the technical appraisal done by the ncdc was weak due to which investments had not fructified. ncdc's contention that soil analysis at the time of appraisal would have taken a long time and was not the only factor determining production was not tenable. it said soil played an important role in determining feasibility of fish ponds and audit scrutiny revealed that one of the reasons for stopping investment on the project was non-retention of waters in ponds or reservoirs for four to six months in a year. ncdc admitted shortfalls identified in the scheme but stated that no significant progress was expected in the project keeping in view the investment made. this was not tenable as the benefits envisaged in the scheme could not be achieved.

8,New drug policy to be finalised by October,"new delhi: a new drug policy aiming at reducing the price controls is likely to be finalised by october. paving the way for finalisation of the draft new drug policy document, national pharmaceutical pricing authority (nppa) is expected to submit its new recommendations by next month end. ""we hope to receive the new data from niper (national institute of pharmaceutical education and research) in two weeks time and finalise our report by next month end,"" nppa chairman b s baswan said. chemicals and fertiliser ministry had earlier directed the niper to submit latest data about the drugs considering the cut off date as march 31, 2001 instead of march 31, 1999 following health ministry's objection on it. according to sources health ministry had raised objections to the draft of the new policy saying it was based on old data and had asked the fertiliser and chemicals ministry to incorporate necessary changes in line with latest data. health ministry has suggested that criterion on the turnover data be applicable to an updated list of companies upto march 2001. baswan said after the data is received from niper, nppa would collate various details and recast the draft policy document. according to sources the new drug policy is likely to reduce the span of control from existing level of 74 drugs to 35 drugs. under the new policy, bulk drugs with an annual turnover of rs five crore per annum would come under the controlled price regime, sources said adding that the turnover limit for company manufacturing the drug would be at rs 20 crore a year. as per the existing drug policy, the criterion of a drug being under price control is minimum annual turnover of rs one crore for a bulk drug and rs four crore annual turnover for the company. currently, monopoly situation is created if a single formulation drug has more than 50 per cent market share. earlier union minister of fertiliser and chemicals sukhdev singh dhindsa had said that the new policy will take into account all initiative required for boosting research and development in the sector apart from reducing the span for control from drugs. he said the policy is likely to incorporate the recommendations of the task force on knowledge-based industries under the chairmanship of union minister for human resource development and science and technology, murli manohar joshi.",new delhi
9,States told to have own anti-terrorist laws,"new delhi: the centre has asked the states to enact their own anti-terrorist laws as the central law on terrorism -- ``the terrorism (prevention) bill 2000''--would take time, union minister of state for home affairs i d swami told the times of india. several state governments have asked the centre to pass a central law which will enable them to deal with smuggling, insurgency and crimes that threaten the internal security. ``we have asked the state governments to enact their own laws to deal with crimes like cross-border and cross-state border smuggling of narcotic, arms, counterfeit currency, insurgency and situations threatening internal security,'' he said. the minister said that ``in any case such matters come under the concurrent list and hence within the purview of the states.'' some states like tamil nadu have already enacted such a law, he said. swami claimed that absence of a central law like the terrorist and disruptive activities (prevention) act (tada) had left a vacuum and the states were feeling it now. states like maharashtra, andhra pradesh, west bengal and uttar pradesh have been asking the centre to pass a central law to enable them to tackle the growing tentacles of pakistan's inter-services intelligence (isi), among other things. the central law which was to overcome the vacuum caused by the absence of tada had run into difficulties as the human rights activists had opposed the passing of such a law, saying it would be as draconian as the tada. they alleged that the bill drafted for the purpose contained provisions which gave a wide scope of its misuse by the police against citizens. the centre had drafted the terrorism (prevention) bill 2000 and claimed that it included provisions which provided safety against any possible misuse of the law by the police. however, human rights activists and even the national human rights commission had questioned the veracity of the centre's claim and so the bill had remained where it was. according to swami, ``it is strange that the united kingdom has already passed such an anti-terrorism law by enlarging the scope of law against irish terrorists. and our constitution is largely based on uk's parliamentary democracy. if the mother of democracy can enact such a law why are we hesitating to do so,'' swami asked.

10,India lags in framing biodiversity laws,"new delhi: even as opinions vary on basmati patent issue with some branding the recent us patent office (uspto) ruling as a victory for india while others calling the battle as lost, agricultural experts are unanimous in saying the country lags behind in formulating relevant laws making it difficult to protect the country's bio-diversity. uspto on august 14 upheld us company ricetec inc's patent on three rice lines developed by it, prohibiting, however, the company from using the term `basmati'. the company had earlier named these rice lines as `basmati rice lines and grains' and got a patent in september 1997 on the basis of 20 such claims. the recent ruling is the result of india's efforts challenging three such claims. it strikes down the use of the term `basmati' for these rice lines, allowing ricetec to use the titles, bas-867, rt-1117 and rt-1121, for them, a development which many brand as a victory for india. insisting that recent uspto ruling did not mean infringement on india's bio-diversity, dr mangla rai, deputy director general for crops at indian council of agricultural research, said the country must soon frame and implement laws on plant variety protection, bio-diversity and geographical protection. had the geographical protection law been there, ricetec could not have branded its rice lines as ""basmati rice lines and grains"" in the first place, as the law would have protected basmati on the basis of geographical indicators, rai said. once laws on bio-diversity and plant variety are made, any country using indian germplasm to evolve new varieties, will have to pay india and share benefits of the outcome, rai said. he said it was the us law which allowed the company to use basmati type material and come up with new lines. india can also come up with a law and improve upon existing material from other countries and claim intellectual property rights on them. the ruling would not have an adverse impact on basmati exports from the country, he said. on the question whether patent allows ricetec to claim that rice lines developed by them are superior to basmati, rai said their lines might be superior in some characters and in marketing, use of such tactics is generally allowed. calling the ruling to be a ""resounding victory"" for india as the term basmati has been dropped from the patent, council of scientific and industrial research director general r a mashelkar said while india had challenged only three out of 20 claims, 15 were knocked out in may. remaining five claims based on which the patent has been granted related to rice lines which they have developed by crossing a pakistan line with a us rice line. these claims are linked to characteristics such as high yield, disease resistance, and photo sensitiveness. it is a perfectly legitimate innovation for which india need not be concerned, mashelkar said. on being asked that ricetec can now brand its rice as superior to basmati, he said he did not agree with such reports. ""india is not used to winning. even if we win, we try to look it as a defeat,"" mashelkar said. after turmeric and neem victory, the country should take this ruling as a hat trick as no other country has been able to win like this in uspto, he claimed. however, president of the forum for biotechnology and food security, devinder sharma, said the judgement meant india could no longer say basmati is ""ours"". sharma said the abstract associated with the ruling allows the company to go to the market claiming that their rice lines are superior to basmati. thus ""we have lost the monopoly over basmati and it has now more or less become a generic name."" calling for laws for protection of bio-diversity which is specific to india due to its geography, sharma said though the country is fighting in the wto for protecting basmati under the geographical indicators, it has not yet framed norms for the geographical appellation act, notified in december 1999. had the country made these norms and informed wto, it would have ensured that basmati rice is nowhere in the world marketed by this name. however, now that uspto has passed the ruling, basmati cannot be protected in the us. but, these rules, once framed, would help in protecting other things which are traditionally important for india, like alphonso mango, kanjeevaram sarees and darjeeling tea, sharma said. he said the government should at least try to highlight flaws in the us patenting system as out of the original 20 claims, patent has been granted only on the basis of five claims while the remaining 15 had been struck down. agreeing with sharma's views, dr suman sahai of the gene campaign alleged that basmati case had been handled ""badly"" by the government and uspto had given all rights to ricetec by stating that their rice lines were superior to basmati. she said icar had no data to fight ricetec's claims on the novelty of its strains. no data exists listing the characteristics of the highly prized basmati strains. there is no information on the distinguishing features of basmati varieties, their growing characteristics and qualities of grains, she said.",new delhi
11,Oppn fire failed to singe government,"new delhi: just when one thought that the ongoing parliament session was coming to a tame end, there were fireworks last week. the government was cornered on a host of issues but, by the end of the week, it had managed to wriggle out. the tehelka controversy resurfaced with a bang with reports saying that commercial sex workers had been used to ensnare defence personnel in its sting operations. restless samata party members, still angry over the forced resignation of their leader george fernandes, demanded action against the tehelka team. the opposition parties also came back into the attack as they raised uncomfortable questions on the the government's efforts to saffronise education as also on the grim economic situation and the disinvestment policy. related links having failed to nail the government on the uti muddle earlier, the congress sought to embarrass the government by moving a privilege motion against finance minister yashwant sinha for having misled the rajya sabha. the week also witnessed a series of adjournments on issues ranging from the tehelka controversy to reports that india had lost the patent on basmati rice to an american firm. with members ignoring lok sabha speaker gmc balayogi's repeated pleas for order, the latter decided to crack the whip and proposed that henceforth anybody barging into the well of house would risk suspension for a week. most political parties endorsed his suggestion at a specially convened meeting but samajwadi party, with a clear eye on the coming up elections, played spoilsport, saying such rules could not be imposed on mps. the week opened with congress and cpm members seeking a clarification from prime minister vajpayee for his reported remarks on christian missionaries engaging in conversions. angry opposition members reminded the pm about his commitment on the floor of the house that his government was not bound by the bjp and rss agenda and wondered if this hidden agenda was now out in the open. bjp members countered the opposition attack vociferously, maintaining that the pm had said nothing objectionable and that he actually needed to be congratulated for his remarks. hrd minister murli manohar joshi also found himself on the defensive as nda partners joined the opposition in mounting a rigorous attack on the government's attempts at saffronisation education. the samata party, dmk, janata dal(u) and the tdp reminded joshi that linking education and religion was dangerous and unacceptable. they termed the proposal to introduce astrology and vedic mathematics as retrograde. they also let it be known that state governments would not accept any such changes and that they should be first consulted before the centre tinkered with the education policy. even as parliament saw several adjournments and volatile exchanges between the opposition and the treasury benches, the two houses managed to squeeze in some legislative business. among the bills passed last week was the 91st constitution amendment bill, extending a freeze on the number of lok sabha seats till 2026.

12,Tehelka revelations spur debate on privacy laws,"mumbai: the tehelka revelations have renewed the debate on the justification of invasion of privacy in public interest. the disclosures may not reach a legal denouement, but they have certainly raised the question of the infringement of fundamental rights. while some, who justify the means to achieve an end, argue that everything is fair in the war against corruption, others question the fallout of the spread of ``keyhole journalism''. former maharashtra chief secretary j b d'souza said the dotcom was ``doing a service to the nation'', adding the invasion of privacy was ``a minor price to pay''. civil rights activist and advocate m a rane endorsed this view. ``where public affairs are concerned, the right to privacy is no defence,'' he said. former congress mla chandrashekar prabhu, who has also worked as a newspaper editor, added a word of caution. ``one needs to draw the line somewhere. the investigation should not infringe on the legal rights of the individual,'' he said. however, noted lawyer p r vakil said he was distinctly uncomfortable with the methods employed by tehelka.com to arrive at the truth. ``i certainly don't approve of the way they offered women to the defence officials and then secretly filmed them,'' he said. vakil said the tapes could not be treated as evidence in the court as indian law stipulated that for such ploys to be construed as evidence, the illegal demands had to come from those who were under scrutiny. senior lawyer aspi chinoy said, ``unlike in the west, the concept of entrapment is still largely unfamiliar to indian law.'' legal hawks contend that the debate on tehelka's methods has arisen because the right to privacy is not codified in india. the constitution does not guarantee the right to privacy, but the supreme court has included it as an essential ingredient of personal liberty guaranteed by article 21 of the constitution. in the kharak singh case of 1964, the apex court ruled that personal liberty could not be construed as excluding from its purview an invasion on the part of the police of the sanctity of a man's home and an intrusion into his personal security. another relevant case is the one relating to the publication of the so-called autobiography of notorious criminal auto shankar in the tamil weekly nakheeran in 1994, where the supreme court ruled that every citizen had the right to safeguard his\her privacy and that nothing could be published about the family, marriage and education, ``whether truthful or otherwise'', without the citizen's consent. however, there are two exceptions to this ruling. if, for example, the material sought to be published is based on public records, including court records, the right to privacy no longer subsists. secondly, in the case of public officials, the right to privacy does not apply in respect to ``conduct relevant to the discharge of their duties''. a part of the problem posed by tehelka's sting operation also arises from the fact that evidence, even if illegally obtained, is admissible in indian courts. in the the us, illegally obtained evidence (such as by breaching privacy laws) is inadmissible. however, the us supreme court had recently ruled that the press might not be held liable for publishing illegally intercepted information if the subject was of ``public importance'' and the press had not participated in the interception. in the uk, on the other hand, there is no legal right to privacy.

13,BJP to monitor its ministers,"new delhi: bjp president k jana krishnamurthy, party sources say, has decided to monitor ministries--particularly those of an economic nature--headed by bjp ministers, both for performance and cleanliness. the objective is to check any allegations which, if proved correct, will be brought to the notice of the minister concerned to rectify; if the minister himself is involved, to create pressure for his removal. it is also to preempt the opposition from attacking the government, and create the impression that even if something goes wrong, the government is itself willing to clean up. krishnamurthy himself is unwilling to say anything beyond the fact that his party ``will stand by the policies of the government and pass on any suggestion or feedback made by the people to the government"". the bjp also wants to stress that while things can go wrong, what makes the party different from its predecessors is that once something surfaces, it takes action--as in the us-64 case--rather than seeking to bury it. he added that the party also reserves the right to make recommendations for the more efficient and transparent running of the government. so far, party sources say, three ministries have been examined: shanta kumar's food and civil supplies, m venkaiah naidu's rural development and b c khanduri's road transport and highways. in shanta kumar's case, after shiv sena mp satish pradhan wrote first to home minister lk advani and subsequently, to the prime minister with a complaint about financial irregularities in the food corporation of india and the public distribution system in maharashtra, an informal cbi enquiry, sources said was conducted. it was discovered that there was not much in the allegations. also, shanta kumar was able to defend himself adequately. as for naidu, his ministry is being monitored as its schemes directly affect crores of voters. in his presidential speech at the bjp's national executive meeting, krishnamurthy had suggested that these schemes be monitored. on saturday, krishnamurthy expressed satisfaction that two suggestions he made at the national executive had been accepted: the first on norms about entry into the nda, and the second on monitoring rural development schemes. finally, khanduri is under scrutiny because of the ``construction package va and vc four laning of national highway no 2"". it is a world bank funded project, and under its guidelines, domestic companies have been given a 7.5 per cent advantage. after tenders were invited, sources said the competition narrowed down to two joint ventures--larsen and toubro and hindustan construction corporation while the other was gammon india with an international partner. the first was about to secure the contract when a national highways authority of india general manager allegedly changed the rules to suit the second jv. when this came to the notice of the bjp, it notified khanduri and asked him to find out how this had happened. clearly, the party wants to play a more active role in the running of the government.

14,High cost prevents govt from total dredging of lake,"hyderabad: dredging is the only way to clean up the hussain sagar, but the government has not undertaken it. even though the hussain sagar has been polluted for many years, the lake was dredged only once and that too only partially. the dredging was undertaken by the hyderabad urban development authority (huda) in 1996 when the necklace road was constructed. dredging was done along the necklace road up to a length of 3.2 km, even though the necklace road is 3.6 km in length. according to superintending engineer, huda, vivek deshmukh, since there are four bridges along the necklace road, dredging was not done along the entire stretch. the total volume of dredging that was done in hussainsagar was about six lakh cubic metres and the soil was used to build green park beds along the necklace road. the dredging undertaken by najarjuna construction company,under huda supervision, done at a cost of rs 40 per cubic metre in 1996, helped clean up the lake and the soil removed was highly fertile, enabling the development of greenery. the total cost of dredging was rs 2.5 crore. ""it is not possible to dredge the entire hussainsagar as it is not financially viable. it is also not needed,"" deshmukh said. at the present cost of rs 60 per cubic metre, dredging the entire hussainsagar will cost the huda rs 200 crore. moreover, dredging the hussainsagar, which is 1,68,000 cubic metres will require a lot of planning. vivek deshmukh said rather than dredging, if water inflow and outflows were prevented from getting choked, the water in the lake would be much cleaner. the flood level recorded over the years at hussain sagar has gone up which shows that the inlet and outlets are getting blocked, he said. the level recorded in september 1950 was 514.39 m and the flood level recorded in september 1962 was 514.62 m. on august 24, last year the flood level recorded was 515.06 m, which resulted in floods in the city.

15,Laloo's bid to enter national politics scuttled,"patna: the refusal of all india congress committee (aicc) president sonia gandhi to participate in the ""mahadharna"" staged by the rashtriya janata dal (rjd) president laloo prasad yadav in delhi on august 21 to protest against the uti scam is being viewed here by senior congress leaders as a setback to latter's attempt to return to national politics. ""sonia virtually snubbed laloo by directing aicc general secretary and in charge of bihar mahavir prasad to attend the mahadharna,"" a senior bihar pradesh congress committee (bpcc) functionary and minister in the rabri government said here on saturday. besides, sonia made it a point not to send any higher-rung aicc leader to the dharna venue, he said. moreover, sonia treated laloo as merely a state-level leader and rjd as a regional party only, he said, adding that she, therefore, directed prasad to participate in the dharna. ""laloo has been cut down to size by the aicc president,"" he said. according to him, the congress high command had taken the recent killings of dalits in mataurha and dutt-mai villages in patna district by the jainandan yadav gang and the failure of the police to arrest him very seriously. however, a bpcc executive member felt that the party's state chief dr shakeel ahmad should have himself visited mataurha and dutt-mai. his visit would have sent a different message to the people, he added. he, however, maintained that ahmad had sent a high-level fact finding team of the party to mataurha. sonia's public snub to laloo notwithstanding, majority of congress leaders ruled out the possibility of congress withdrawing support from the rjd government. for, the upper caste vote bank has not returned to the party fold. besides, despite their disenchantment with the rjd, the muslims, too, are unlikely to back the congress, observers feel.

16,"Bihar govt responsible for Mataurha, Dutt-Mai massacres: Paswan","mataurha, patna: communication minister and lok janashakti party's national president ram vilas paswan, who visited both mataurha and dutt-mai villages under the dhanarua police station of patna district here on saturday, announced ex-gratia payment of rs 50,000 from party fund at both the places among the families of massacre victims. paswan called on the sdo (telephone) and det at mataurha and asked them why a telephone exchange was not set up at the bhagwangarh ps despite his order in this connection an year ago that each and every block and police station of extremist-affected areas must have a telephone exchange. he announced that wireless in local loop (wll) exchange would be set up at the bhagwangarh ps by november end. on getting complaints from the villagers that the sdo (telephone) did not stay at masaurhi, but at patna, paswan directed the telecommunication officials from patna accompanying him to camp at the village, listen to villagers' complaints and redress them as far as possible. he said that his party had been demanding dismissal of the bihar government and imposition of the president's rule, but since the nda had no majority in the rajya sabha it was crippled there. the union minister held the bihar government directly responsible for the mataurha and dutt-mai massacres. ""those, who ever try to raise their voice against the state government, are crushed, while government officials discharging their duties honestly and sincerely are transferred,"" he added. he called upon poor villagers, particularly dalits, to remain united to face any attack. he said that in the absence of electricity even telephone exchanges were idle and not functioning. at dutt-mai village, where three children and three women of two dalit families had lost their lives in the massacre on thursday, paswan announced setting up of wll exchange near the village by november end. he also stated that those consumers, who had deposited the initial amount by the date (august 25) would get the telephone connection by november end. telecommunication officers failing to implement the decision by the prescribed period would be transferred, he added. paswan also said that the state government had adopted the `divide and rule' policy for dalits in order to remain in power. ""by naming maoist communist centre (mcc), the state government concealed the name of laloo sena, its mps and mlas,"" he said. he said the congress was shedding crocodile tears for dalits since it was not withdrawing its support from the rabri government. he also criticised the bahujan samaj party for playing the cards of secularism and communalism. paswan described laloo prasad yadav as a man of `inverted mind'. he said that he would report to the prime minister about the situation of the two villages and informed the villagers about his party's programme of demonstration at new delhi on august 27. party mlc ramesh prasad singh announced that he would get a community house constructed in the village by paying rs 2 lakh from his legislator's quota.
