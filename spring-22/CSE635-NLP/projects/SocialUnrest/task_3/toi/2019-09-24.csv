2,PMO pulls up govt for delay in projects funded by Centre,"LUCKNOW: The PMO has pulled up the state government for being sluggish in the implementation of various projects funded by it in Lucknow. Disappointment on this front was discernible with Union minister of state in the PMO Vijay Goyal remarking that â€œmuch is needed to be doneâ€� soon before his departure for New Delhi, after a day-long hectic review meetings here on Monday.

â€œWe are very much concerned with the PMâ€™s Lucknow constituency, where many projects are running behind schedule,â€� Goyal said. Significantly, Goyalâ€™s remark has created a flutter here within the political circles, as it is being described as a veiled criticism of state urban development minister Lalji Tandon, who is the PMâ€™s representative in his constituency and responsible for monitoring the implementation of these projects. One of the projects delayed, Goyal said, was the implementation of the prestigious Gomati Action Plan (Phase I).

It was now slated to be completed by November 2002 with the construction of the sewage treatment plant (STP) meant for treating sewage of only 3 lakh population of the city.

The second phase of the plan, he said, would cost Rs 280 crore and under it another STP with a capacity of treating the sewage of remaining 23 lakh population of the city would be set up in Kukrail. While the Centre would contribute 70 per cent fund for it, the remaining 30 per cent would be borne by the state government, he said. He said chief minister Mayawati had evinced a keen interest in the Gomati Action Plan and promised to expedite the work on the first phase. With regard to the delay in the commissioning of other projects, he said the CM had also assured to complete them as early as possible.

Other projects under review include construction of ring road around Lucknow, diversion of Lucknow-Bijnor road, upgradation of regional science centre, laying of 69 kms-long Indian Oil pipeline at a cost of Rs 74 crore,expansion of Lucknow airport, setting up of power stations and sub-stations, construction of old age homes and regional centre of Sports Authority, besides providing additional facilities to the King Georgeâ€™s Medical Hospital.

In line with this, he said, at least four more overbridges at Daligang, Bijnor, Sadar and Mawaiya railway crossings to ease traffic system would be sanctioned after making requisite funds available for them. While underlining the need for strengthening the internet structure, which was in a pitiable condition at present in the city, he said he would take up the issue with the Union telecommunication minister. â€œWe wish to turn the PMâ€™s Lucknow constituency into a model constituency of the country,â€� he said adding that it was, however, not possible without the cooperation of the state government in effective implementation of the sanctioned projects in a time-bound manner.

He regretted that UP ranked 15th in the country in terms of overall percentage utilisation of the MPLADS funds. In order to its optimum utilisation, he said a request was made to the state government to give full authority to district level for issuance of sanction of works under the MPLADS. District magistrates, in turn, were thus required to issue sanction for the works recommended by the MPs within 45 days. All information would be put on a website showing day-to-day progress of the works recommended by MPs for transparency and effective monitoring.

The accused, alleged to having links with a local mafia turned MLC, had named three others involved in the murder. Police said that possibility of some close relatives of Paritosh being involved in the crime could not be ruled out.A crime reporter with Jansatta, Paritosh was shot dead at his Gomtinagar residence on April 14 last.

Thereafter, one of the recovered vehicles was released by the court when Ajita proved that the two-wheeler was her own. When I called a press conference, Paritosh orchestrated a walkout and later told me that he had very close relations with the CO hence he cannot help me, Anna said.This left Anna infuriated and he decided to avenge. As he was a crime reporter, he had good connections in the administration and was also the son-in-law of Rajendra Dwivedi who in turn has family relations with us, I just kept quiet then, Anna said. Later it was learnt that relations between Paritosh and his wife Subodhni had got strained. He even heard her brother Chetan talk about divorce between the two and get Subodhni re-married. Chetan even expressed the desire to adopt the child of Paritosh to leave Subodhni single.Anna said that he then decided to liquidate Paritosh and contacted his friend Rakesh Verma who has been involved in the murder of Sunil Singh and Guddu Dixit and is linked with a mafia turned politician who is now a MLC.

4,Poor will suffer if MSEB is privatised: Jharkand minister,"PUNE: Even though the lack of unanimity among unions within the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) was clearly visible, the leaders attending the state-level convention of the MSEB Workersâ€™ Union on Sunday were united in denouncing privatisation of the power sector. Delivering the inaugural address of the convention, energy minister of Jharkhand, Lalchand Mahato, said privatisation of the sector will create darkness in semi-urban areas and villages. Private companies will invest in this capital intensive sector only when returns and profits are guaranteed, he pointed out. â€œA company entering the business of generation or supply will naturally distribute power in pockets with high usage and capacity to pay steep tariffs,â€� he said. The Jharkhand minister, a trade union leader himself, criticised the unions affiliated to INTUC, AITUC and CITU for lying low despite the state governmentâ€™s move to go ahead with the privatisation of the MSEB. â€œSuch unions are there only to serve their own vested interests, in collusion with managements and the government,â€� he remarked. Mahato said it has been proved that private companies in essential services hardly bother about social obligations. He warned that even if a private company did supply power to all areas without prejudice, the tariffs would be a â€˜killerâ€™. Talking about the power situation in his own state, Mahato said he had opposed chief minister Babulal Marandiâ€™s proposal to hand over the sick state electricity board (SEB) to private parties. â€œThankfully, the SEB has not been privatised and efforts are on to turn it into a profit-making organisation,â€� he said. Girish Pandye, general-secretary of the NTPC union in Uttar Pradesh, corroborated Mahatoâ€™s views by contending that electricity would become a luxury only for the rich. â€œThe poor will have to stay without lights as tariffs would not be affordable,â€� he remarked. Pandye pointed out that all the states which have implemented the privatisation or trifurcation model in the energy sector were suffering badly. Citing the example of Orissa, Pandye said the American company which had entered the business of electricity supply had left the country, leaving all its consumers in the lurch. Similarly, the three corporations set-up for generation, transmission and distribution of power in Andhra Pradesh have been a failure as the cost of power has increased to Rs 7.50 per unit. Pandye, who led the agitation against the UP governmentâ€™s move to trifurcate the UPSEB, recalled the clandestine manner in which the legislators rushed with the â€˜reforms ordinanceâ€™ in the house even as protests were being held outside. Pandye castigated the UP government for going back on its promise of trying out the trifurcation model, along with privatisation, only for a specific period of one year. â€œAlthough two-and-a-half years have passed, the government continues with the â€˜breaking upâ€™ formula even as losses have touched Rs 5,300 crore,â€� he noted. Sharad Rao, president of the MSEB Workersâ€™ Union charged the state government with deliberate moves to destabilise the electricity board with the intention of selling it off at a cheap rate. â€œWe will never allow privatisation as the real problem is mismanagement, red-tape and political interference,â€� Rao thundered. The convention also passed resolutions on better pay-scales, payment of outstanding arrears, pension scheme and overtime payments. Rao has already warned of an indefinite strike from October 21 if the unionâ€™s demands were not met even after a week-long agitation, starting on September 23.

5,"DF govt may ban VHP, Bajrang Dal","MUMBAI: Alarmed by the situation created by â€œfundamentalistâ€� forces in neighbouring Gujarat, the Maharashtra government is likely to initiate moves to ban the Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), minister of state for home Kripashanker Singh said on Monday. â€œThe situation created by fundamentalist forces in Gujarat can affect even Maharashtra.We demand a ban on them,â€� Singh told reporters here.

He said after a meeting with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Tuesday, the state government â€œwill write a formal letter to deputy prime minister L.K. Advani to seek a ban on these organisationsâ€�. He said similar demands to ban the Bajrang Dal and the VHP should be made in all other states ruled by â€œsecularâ€� parties.

Singh said senior VHP leader Pravin Togadia was recently asked by the Mumbai police to leave the state for his â€œprovocativeâ€� remarks. â€œDuring his visit to Mumbai during the Ganesh Mahotsav, Togadia made some provocative remarks.

He was summoned by the police and asked to leave Maharashtra,â€� Singh said. He said Togadia subsequently â€œcut shortâ€� his three-day visit and left Mumbai â€œonly after a dayâ€™s stayâ€�. To a question on underworld don Abu Salem, he said, â€œNo decision has been taken yet on sending a police team to Lisbon.â€�

â€œThe team is ready, the CBI can join if it wants,â€� he said, adding that the state government had â€œdocumentary evidenceâ€� to prove Salemâ€™s involvement in various cases of crime in the city.

6,568 Cong men in S'rashtra fill forms for polls,"RAJKOT: As many as 568 Congress men have shown their willingness to contest the ensuing state Assembly elections for the 58 seats from Saurashtra. Congress leaders have termed this trend as ""a wave in their favour and the mood of the people to go in for a change"". Gadhada in Bhavnagar district has the highest number contestants with as many as 36 people filling up the forms. Saurashtra has been a Patel-dominated region, and out of the total 568 aspirants, almost 74 per cent are from the Patel community. One of the reasons attributed for the high percentage of Patel leaders trying to enter the electoral arena was the fact that there were better chances of winning if one was a Patel candidate. After the Patels, the highest number of forms were from the Koli community, which also has considerable number of voters, though mainly concentrated in the Bhavnagar and Amreli region. However, the Congress in Saurashtra also fears that the rejection of forms may turn a large number of prospective candidates into passive workers, which could harm their interests at the hustings. The party also fears that some may even seek a ticket from the BJP in case they were denied by the Congress. A senior Congress leader told TNN on Monday that ""some of these leaders would be asked to withdraw on the assurance of giving them a lucrative post once the party was elected to power"". At present, the BJP has complete sway over the region. Out of the 58 seats, the saffron brigade has all but six seats under their belt.

7,State govt makes hospitals out of bounds for media,"BARASAT: It is now official. The Left Front government has issued directions to â€˜restrictâ€™ media access to hospitals and health centres in the state. The restriction, however, amounts to a virtual ban. The decision has been communicated to the district magistrates, who in turn have convened a meeting of concerned officials and asked them to implement the order. Newsmen will now have to apply in writing, specifying the purpose of their visit to hospitals and who they would meet, and get written permission before they are allowed into government hospitals. In North 24-Parganas, the decision was communicated at a meeting on September 13, attended by DM H.K. Dwivedi, zilla parishad sabhadhipati Aparna Gupta, chief medical officer health (CMOH) Shankar Saha and all block medical officers (BMOH), senior doctors and health workers. When asked about the meeting, Gupta reacted sharply and asked for the source of the â€˜leakâ€™. â€œUnless you tell me the name of the person, I will not speak,â€� she said. But she also warned of serious consequences if the new rule is violated. â€œWe will definitely take action in case of a violation as permissible under law,â€� she warned. The DM claimed the decision was taken to â€œavoid misunderstanding and confusionâ€�. He said, â€œThere should be a limit to everything and media has been taking liberties. They must realise this and restrain themselves,â€� he said. Saha added, â€œNo health official will speak to the media without official permission.â€� According to doctors in the district, they have also been warned to comply. â€œWe will have to pay a heavy price if newsmen are allowed into health centres ,â€� said a BMO. According to him, the media would first have to apply to the superior authority â€” CMOH in case of district and rural hospitals, block primary and primary health centres and superintendents and principals for city hospitals and medical colleges. Then the applicant would have to specify the purpose, the time, the organisation he represents and officials sought to be interviewed. Some health officials justified the ban by pointing to the recent behaviour of television crews, who barged into ICUs. Others are not convinced. â€œWhy are we interested in blocking information if we are transparent, honest and there is no flaw in the system?â€� they wondered.

8,"Compensate farmers, CPM tells govt","HYDERABAD: Taking strong objection to the governmentâ€™s decision to stop release of water to farmers under Nagarjunasagar reservoir, the CPM state committee has demanded the government to compensate farmers.

â€œFollowing the release of water into the ayacut under Nagarjunasagar project from Sept. 1, farmers took up transplantation in over 40,000 acres.

The governmentâ€™s latest decision would adversely affect the crops sown in the area,â€� CPM state secretary B V Raghavulu said.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Raghavulu said that instead of stopping the release of water, the government should examine the possibilities of pumping water from the projectâ€™s dead storage, about 490 ft, to help farmers.

â€œThe government should consult experts and engineers concerned to assess the possibilities.

If it is not feasible, the government should compensate farmers,â€� he said.

Alleging that the decision to release 150 tmc water to Vijayawada Thermal Power Station (VTPS) in April has resulted in the crisis, he said that since the crisis was manmade, the government should compensate the farmers of the area.

10,Begusarai district board to protest HFC closure plan,"BEGUSARAI: Besides approving various Union government schemes for implementation, the district board in its important meeting on Saturday decided unanimously to adopt the path of agitation in protest against the alleged arbitrary decision of the Union government to close down the Barauni unit of Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation. The meet presided over by the district board chairman Ratan Singh was attended by Rajo Singh MP and MLAs of the district Bhola Singh, Rajendra Rajan, Rajendra Prasad Singh and Uttam Kumar Yadav, apart from the members of the district board. The meet also resolved to develop district board market complex on the lands of the board lying unutilised in the urban areas to generate revenue. The meet also authorised the chairman to constitute various committees to speed up development work. According to sources, the meet earmarked Rs 4.90 crore for development works in the district for the year 2002-2003 and decided to distribute the amount on the basis of population under various district board constituencies. After the meet, the district board chairman talking to mediapersons said that the scarcity of funds comes in the way of development works essential for the district. Tax imposed on cremation: The district administration has planned to impose Rs 101 as tax on cremation of body on the river bank at Simariya Ghat. The imposition of tax on the cremation of corpses will compel the people to take help of electric crematorium, built several years ago to save the river Ganga from pollution, said the DM, K P Ramaiah, while talking to this correspondent. The DM said the decision to impose tax on the disposal of the dead body at the Simariya Ghat was taken in a recent meeting of the Simariya Ghat Mela organising committee. Sources said about 40 to 50 bodies are cremated everyday at the Simariya Ghat, which has religious significance. The DM further said that revenue collected from the cremation of bodies at the Simariya Ghat will be spent on arrangements made by the district administration for the month-long â€œKalp Vas Melaâ€� held every year at Simariya Ghat during the Kartik month. Replying to a question, the DM said that special arrangements have been made to supply electricity for at least 20 hours everyday to the crematorium at Simariya Ghat so that the people might not have inconvenience in cremating bodies of their kin. Leaders of various political parties and activists of voluntary organisations, however, have opposed the move of the district administration to impose tax on cremation of the bodies at the ghat. In separate memorandums to the DM, they have urged to withdraw the decision in the interest of the poor people.

16,3 juveniles arrested for robbing homes,"NEW DELHI: Three juveniles have been arrested for their alleged involvement in several burglary cases in Vasant Kunj and highway showrooms in Mahipalpur.

According to the police, the three are aged between 12 and 16 years. They were in a remand home till about last month.

Southwest district police chief Tejendra Luthra said with their arrest, the police have solved four cases of burglary reported from Vasant Kunj area. Investigations are on to find if they are involved in any other case. The police have recovered the burgled jewellery articles and garments from the accused.

One of the accused is involved in 21 cases of burglary. The police said he has been involved in similar incidents since 1997. Since the accused had worked in a jewellery showroom in Karol Bagh, that experience helped him dispose the stolen items easily, the police said.

According to him, the accused have a peculiar style of breaking into houses. They used to engage thin, young boys, aged between 10 and 11 years. These boys helped the accused in entering locked houses through windows.

â€˜â€˜The accused used to first break the window or ventilator grill of the kitchen. They selected those houses whose windows were located towards the back lanes,â€™â€™ Luthra said.

17,Children protest against gender bias,"NEW DELHI: On the occasion of Girl Child Day on Tuesday, about 1,000 schoolchildren mainly from the primary classes, came together in Hauz Khas to protest against female foeticide.

Most of the children, holding placards and banners, came from Deepalaya â€” an organisation which promotes education and empowerment for the girl child.

On being asked why the children had been assembled, 17-year-old Ritu Pal from Kalkaji said: â€˜â€˜We want sonography to be stopped.â€™â€™

Similar replies were given by the other children, most of them aged below 12 years.

Secretary of Deepalaya T K Mathew said: â€˜â€˜The protest is a humble gesture to highlight the issue of gender discrimination, especially female foeticide. Since Hauz Khas is one of the areas with the lowest proportion of girls, we thought we would start the protest from here itself.â€™â€™

According to a recent article published in The Times of India, the 2001 census revealed that the areas of Delhi with the largest number of â€˜missingâ€™ girls â€” who are not born because of female foeticide â€” are also some of the poshest ones. This is reflected in the low child sex ratio in areas like Defence Colony and Punjabi Bagh.

18,"Youth killed, fresh violence erupts in Belgaum","BELGAUM: A youth was killed and two others stabbed as fresh communal violence broke out in Belgaum city on Tuesday morning. The condition of the two youths, who were stabbed on Dr B.R. Ambedkar Road, is said to be critical.

Police fired tear gas to disperse groups belonging to the two communities who were pelting stones at each other at New Gandhinagar. They rounded up more then 200 youths.

The Belgaum police declared curfew in the Market police station limits, and parts of Malmurati and Khade Bazaar police limits from 6 pm on Tuesday to 8 am on Wednesday. All educational institutions will remain closed on Wednesday.

According to sources, trouble started at 9.30 on Monday night when a group of people attacked a youth near the Hotel Mayur Malaprabha. He was identified as a resident of Ashoknagar.

But police sources denied the youth had died after being attacked, and said he was hit by an unidentified vehicle. However, the dead man''s family claims there were eight injuries on his body. His body was kept in the mortuary in the District Hospital. The police beefed up security around the hospital and the post-mortem centre on Tuesday morning, and later, forced his family to conduct the funeral.

There were heated arguments between the police and youths belonging to the dead man''s community, who wanted to take the body to his house.

It was during the funeral procession that angry youths stabbed two persons near the hospital. They also pelted stones on shops along the way.

Earlier, a group belonging to Old Gandhinagar area had allegedly pelted stones on a prayer house at Azadnagar, provoking youths and women of Azadnagar and New Gandhinagar to return the exchange. The police failed to disperse the mob with lathis and were forced to fire tear gas.

The angry mob pelted stones and soda bottles on vehicles, buses and a police van deployed on patrol duty at New Gandhinagar. Around 200 youths were taken into custody.

As news of the violence spread, shops and business establishments downed shutters. Schools and colleges declared a half-holiday. Autos and vehicles stayed off the roads and the NWKSRTC withdrew service after noon.

Deputy Commissioner Renuka Chidambaram, who visited the post-mortem centre, told reporters that the cause of the death would be ascertained only after the post-mortem report was released.

Belgaum city had been in the grip of communal violence on Saturday and Sunday, with the situation returning to normal on Monday.

Water Resources Minister H.K. Patil said: ``Karnataka hopes the CMC will appreciate the farmers'' predicament in the state and help them save their standing crop.''''

On TN boycotting the CMC, Patil said he did not agree with TN''s justification that it is tantamount to sub-judice.

The team which flew to KRS dam in three helicopters received memoranda from farmers and leaders of Cauvery Kriya Samiti at Mysore before reaching the dam. At the dam they not only collected data from water resource department officials but also personally inspected the gauging point and noted down outflows and inflows into the dam apart from water released into Visvesvaraiah and Varuna canals.

Later talking to reporters, Goswami said theirs was only a fact-finding committee. ``We will take both the present and future demands of the farmers who have raised their crops in Cauvery delta,'''' he added.

B.R.Sharma, water management expert Indian Council of Agricultural Research, said: ``The team is of the view that water level in the dam has receded while the farmers'' requirement is much more. Though team felt that standing crops are in a good shape, they need more water in days to come for their survival and the water stored is not sufficient.''''

At the guest house, Cauvery Horata Samiti chief G.Made Gowda and KRRS leaders K.S.Puttannaiah presented a memorandum to the team. The team returned to Bangalore after visiting fields in Srirangapattan, Malvalli, Tirumakudalu Narsipur and Maddur taluks.
