0,Poser to govt: why not a Whistleblower Act?,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to the CBI, Centre and Rabri Devi government on a petition seeking an independent probe into allegations of corruption in the Prime Minister''s Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) project.

A Bench of Justices Ruma Pal and P V Reddi also issued notice to the respondents on the question of enacting a ""whistleblower act"" to bring to the fore several incidents of corruption that go unreported due to fear of reprisal from the government.

The petition has been filed by NGO Parivartan and father of slain engineer Satyendra Dubey. Asked why the court should entertain a number of public interest petitions on the same issue, all brought up after the brutal murder of Dubey, petitioners'' counsel Prashant Bhushan said it was bet ter to entertain a few of them so as not to leave out any important aspect that concerned the public.

Dubey, a civil engineering graduate from IIT Kanpur and associated with the GQ project in Bihar, was murdered on November 27, 2003, a few days before he was to take charge as project manager at Koderma.

Dubey had sent a letter to the PMO in which he had complained about massive corruption in construction of the project.

The court has already issued notices to the PMO, among others, on lawyer Rakesh U Upadhayay''s PIL seeking a CBI probe into Dubey''s murder.

Dubey''s confidential letter to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was leaked in the government and he was soon murdered in cold blood, the petition had alleged.

Upadhyayay said despite Dubey''s request not to divulge his name, his identity was disclosed, which led to his murder.

The PMO has, however, denied that the government had ever leaked the name of Dubey.

1,Pappu Yadav arrested after SC rejects bail,"NEW DELHI: His sudden ''illness'' minutes after the Supreme Court rejected his bail application, could not help former independent MP from Bihar, Pappu Yadav, avert the inevitable - arrest by the CBI.

As soon as the apex court set aside the Patna High Court order granting Yadav bail in the Ajit Sarkar murder case, the former Lok Sabha member rushed to AIIMS complaining of some problem in his leg.

The CBI which had investigated the case of the trade union leader''s murder in Purnea, decided to arrest him. When contacted a CBI official said that a team was being sent to the hospital to put Yadav under arrest.

""If the doctors permit, he will be produced before the trial court in Patna as early as possible,"" the official said. Earlier on Friday, the Supreme Court had asked Yadav to surrender.

The court asked the CBI to take him into custody immediately.

A Bench of Justices N Santosh Hegde and B P Singh took strong exception to the manner in which the Patna High Court had let him out on bail in the case pertaining to the murder of trade union leader Ajit Sarkar.

Sarkar''s brother Kalyan Chandra Sarkar had challenged the bail order.

Though the accused had the right to file successive bail applications, the apex court''s judgment added that the high court order did not refer to any fresh ground for Yadav''s release on bail.

""It is the duty of the high court to discuss the fresh grounds on which bail is granted,"" the Bench added.

3,Advani predicts Cong rout in polls,"BANGALORE: Deputy prime minister L.K. Advani on Friday predicted that the Congressâ€™ â€œarroganceâ€™â€™ would result in the partyâ€™s seats tally not crossing the 100-mark in the Lok Sabha elections.

Addressing a well-attended public meeting at the National College grounds here, as part of his Bharat Uday Yatra,Advani said: â€œPeople will not forgive either complacency or arrogance. The Congress president has ridiculed Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayeeâ€™s administration and said â€˜kavita se kaam nahi chaltaâ€™. Is this the way to speak about a man who has spent 50 years in the opposition and his entire life in politics? Look at the arrogance and the language!â€™â€™

The NDA, on the other hand, is asking for a mandate based on track record. â€œDuring our Janadesh Yatra, we promised good governance, security, stability and development. Now Iâ€™ve come again, seeking your mandate to make India a superpower in 2020,â€™â€™ Advani stated.

Tracing BJPâ€™s rise, Advani recalled the party won only two seats in 1984. â€œThe Congress was at its peak and Rajiv Gandhi won more than 400 seats, bettering both Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. But, since then, they have been on the decline, while we and our allies have been on the rise.â€™â€™

The response to his Uday Yatra was an indicator of the peopleâ€™s mood. â€œEven in states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu where we do not have presence, people turned out in thousands to my roadside meetings. I have seen many yatras and I know â€” a good cook needs to test only one grain of rice to see whether it is cooked or not.â€™â€™

Advani said people were flocking to the BJP as they accepted it as a party with a difference. â€œThe situation is like the Congress before 1947. People ask me why we are taking in film stars and cricketers. We hold discussions with people from other political parties, but anyone else who comes does so voluntarily. Why should they not come?â€™â€™

He cut his speech short as the function began late and the election code of conduct comes into effect at 10 pm. Earlier, at Attibele, a little village on the Bangalore-Hosur main road, the Yatra was received with the traditional kahale and kalasas.

People greeted Advani with cheers as he slowly emerged in the hydraulic lift along with BJP state president Ananth Kumar. He was joined by wife Kamala and daughter Pratibha, who are touring with him.

4,"Arson, violence mark farmers' bandh","AHMEDABAD/GANDHINAGAR: The â€˜Gujarat bandhâ€™ call by farmers under the Gujarat Khedut Sangharsh Samiti (GKSS), on Friday, saw some ugly scenes as protesting farmers set ablaze two state transport buses in Ahmedabad district.

Thousands of farmers courted arrest all over the state even as some were booked for rioting in the outskirts of Ahmedabad. Although the response was lukewarm in the urban centres, â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ agitations held up traffic in many rural parts of the state in North and South Gujarat.

The samiti had the complete support of the Congress party and continues to protest against the power tariff hike by the Modi government, unlike the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which has come around.

In the Bhayla and Sari villages of Bavla taluka in Ahmedabad district, two ST buses were burnt, although nobody was hurt. Earlier in the day, the farmers blocked the Ahmedabad-Bavla road, under the leadership of GKSS president Ravji Patel.

The police arrested 26 persons in these cases, of which two turned out to be residents of Sarkhej, said SP (Ahmedabad district) Manoj Agrawal. In Banaskantha, the farmers went on a rampage, blocking roads with tree trunks and unloading truckloads of sand on the highway to arrest traffic.

According to GKSS convenor Bipin Desai, in Surendranagar, Congress MLA Manubhai Makwana who joined in the protests, was also arrested while sitting MP Savshi Makwana too led some 700 protesters on the highway. Several farmers were detained near Jhadeshwar and Nikora chowkdi in Bharuch district.

In Surat district, barring sporadic attempts to disrupt traffic on the NH-6 and NH-8 highways, no untoward incidents were reported. Around 150 persons were detained, including 80 at Bardoli, said SP (Surat district) D J Patel.

Some shops and commercial establishments remained closed at Kamrej, Palsana, Olpad, Bardoli and others parts of the district, according to GKSS. At Palsana and Kamrej, 54 persons were detained by the police, even as â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ agitations marked the protests in Kadodara and Olpad.

The response in Saurashtra region was â€˜mixedâ€™, as barely any shops remained closed in Rajkot, Jamnagar and Amreli districts.

Villages of Junagadh, Bhavnagar, Porbandar,Bhavnagar and Surendranagar saw partial response to the bandh and staged dharnas and â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ agitations. Over 200 persons were arrested from these areas. Traffic was blocked near Limdi for at least 90 minutes. The BJP termed the bandh a big â€˜flopâ€™ show even as state law minister criticised the Congress for supporting the bandh.

5,Advani rips into 'dynastic rule',"COIMBATORE: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Friday accused the Congress of propagating ""dynastic rule"" by projecting party chief Sonia Gandhi''s children as its future leaders.

""I have nothing against Priyanka and Rahul. They have a right to contest elections. But we are against perpetuation of dynastic rule in the country,"" he told reporters before his Bharat Uday Yatra started for Bangalore on its third day.

Advani, who made a brief reference to Priyanka and Rahul on Thursday at Palakkad in Kerala, said his party has nothing against them.

Attacking the Congress chief, he said a person who cannot understand Indian politics and problems of the people is not fit to hold the highest post.

""This issue has spread so much now that there is no need to elaborate it. It is an election issue and after all the person seeking the prime ministerial post should be able to understand Indian politics and the problems of the people,"" he said.

Speaking on the Centre''s peace initiatives, he said that the NDA''s ""zero tolerance of terrorism"" policy has brought those who took to the guns to the negotiating table.

He added: ""It has been the endeavour of the NDA government to wage an uncompromising war against terrorism and to mobilise international opinion against cross-border, state-sponsored terrorism.""

Noting that terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir has not ended, but its scale and intensity has fallen dramatically, Advani said India had fought terrorism while safeguarding democracy and this is evident by the fact that the country had free and fair polls in 2002 with enthusiastic participation of people.

Under Vajpayee''s leadership, the people were more secure than they had ever been in the past three decades, he said, adding security concerns of India were acknowledged in the international community and ""we will pursue these concerns with single-mindedness"".

""By depending on its own strength and the resolve of its people, India has shown it is no pushover,"" he said.

""Today, the Indian cricket team is in Pakistan, which is a small indication of the change brought about by the government of Vajpayee,"" Advani said.

Like many other democracies, India also suffered grievously from terrorism and Jammu and Kashmir was the worst affected but other places, including Tamil Nadu, experienced terrorist depredations and murder of innocent people, he said.

The government was tightening security on the borders by fencing, Advani said, adding the work in Punjab is complete and few areas were left in Rajasthan, where smuggling has died down.

Fencing works in Jammu and Kashmir, where of late tourist inflow witnessed a record growth, and the eastern states would be complete soon, he said.

The government negotiated a settlement with Bodo militants in Assam and talks were progressing with NSCN (I-M), Advani said, adding the Ulfa had no longer sanctuaries across the border. Thanks to cooperation from the Bhutan government, he said.

Lauding the Tamil Nadu government, headed by Jayalalithaa, he said the Centre had received ''unstinted'' cooperation from the state in the war against terrorism.

""The NDA government has created the conditions for people to focus on the paramount task of making India a developed country by 2020,"" he added.

6,HC admits plea on Lahabandh,"KOLKATA: The Green Bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday admitted a public interest litigation by Mahasveta Devi and other eminent persons challenging the construction of an amusement and environment park on the water body of Lahabandh in Santiniketan.

The petitioners complained that for the commercial venture, the Sriniketan Santiniketan Development Authority had allowed the park to be constructed on a BOT basis â€” infringing upon the rights of local fishermen and public. The project had been granted to the Surji Consultants India Private Limited of Kolkata. They submitted that it would cause ecological imbalance.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice Asim Banerjee directed the petitionersâ€™ counsel P.K. Roy to issue notices to the parties after he sought an interim order restraining the SSDA and the developer from implementing the scheme. Only dredging of the water body should be allowed, Roy submitted.

The SSDA counsel said the park would not be constructed on Lahabandh and would not affect the water body. Petitioners like Suchitra Mitra, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Mrinal Sen and Chidananda Dasgupta also complained that the proposed scheme would devastate the wetland and destroy the peaceful sylvan surroundings depriving the rights of local people who use the water daily.

â€œThe state pollution control board seems to have taken the role of the mute spectator and the proposal has not yet been approved by the environment department of West Bengal,â€� they contended.

Advocate general Balai Roy said the state government would ensure that the water body was not filled up and nothing was constructed on encroached land. While expressing the view that there should be no construction affecting water bodies, the Chief Justice questioned why people of West Bengal were not interested in the development of tourism. Considering the prospect of tourism in Santiniketan, he held that such programmes were required.

7,Does money make stars dance to political tunes?,"NEW DELHI: It is money that makes them dance around trees. Now the suspicion is that it''s the same that is making them dance to political tunes.

Allegations that Bollywood and television stars may be climbing the political dais for money, and not for purely ideological reasons, has taken the glitter off their glam-fam image.

The allegation, that it is the jingle of the cash registers that has made them sway to slogans, has been refuted by some of the cine stars who recently entered politics, prompting a Rs 1-crore defamation suit.

Opposing these allegations, actress Celina Jaitley, who recently joined Congress, said, ""I do not know about others but I have stepped into the political arena because I have always felt that I can make a difference.""

Political managers, however, concede that money has always been a factor with the actors joining the political parties as well as those who turn up for campaign duty for individual candidates.

""We were approached on behalf of two of those who recently joined the Congress,"" asserted a BJP supporter who has often liaised between the party and Bollywood.

He would, of course, not agree that any of BJP''s recruits joined the party for a fee.

The suspicion about money being the driver for the tinsel world is particularly strong in the case of those who make guest appearances at election meetings for individual candidates.

They justify their appeal by claiming old association. The alibi has often been exposed as hollow. In one famous incident, for instance, during the December polls in Delhi, a film star confidently introduced a candidate as her old friend.

She proceeded to make a strong appeal to the audience to vote for her friend, contesting from a constituency in South Delhi. The only problem in the script was that the name came wrong.

Film producer Anil Nagrath was rather candid about the issue.

""People in our country are already disillusioned with politicians. This (to get filmstars into politics) is yet another trick to cheat the people. If stars say it''s not for money, then it''s absolutely rubbish. The game of politics is based on money,"" he said.

Action hero Sunil Shetty admitted in Mumbai on Wednesday that celebrities were offered money to appear for inaugurations and even political functions.

""Celebrities are often offered monetary benefits to make appearances for inaugurations, public events and perhaps even for campaigning.

8,Spiralling inflation rate boosts govt spirits,"NEW DELHI: The spirits of the government, that has been hemmed in by the Election Commission''s code of conduct from doing what it needs to do to keep prices under check, lifted somewhat on Friday.

The latest data showed that inflation fell sharply to 5.32 per cent for the week ended February 28 from the previous week''s near 6 per cent.

The industrial production data, also released on Friday, put growth in January at an impressive 7.4 per cent.

This added to the confident mood of the Vajpayee government which hopes to ride back to power on the back of the economic ""feel good factor"".

The government had been a little diffident last week as the Opposition had sought to prick its feel-good balloon, relying on the additional handle provided by the recent inflation data.

On Thursday, the RBI conceded inflation could be a concern, saying it was monitoring inflation trends ""carefully in the light of unexpected developments in the global oil and commodities market"".

Last week, the government too appeared to have thrown in the towel with chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri saying it was difficult to maintain the targeted level of 4-4.5 per cent inflation by the end of current financial year.

10,Cong assails INLD misrule,"HISAR: ""The misrule and misdeeds of INLD govt. During last four years have now compelled the chief minister to apologise to the electorate. When all the political power has been centralised, between father and two sons, then how the chief minister can hold his legislators and ministers responsible for the resentment of the people,"" said Ishwar Singh Poonia, spokesman of the Congress party in a statement here on Saturday.

Lambasting the INLD rule for the rising graph of crime Mr Poonia said, ""The INLD is seeking votes in the name of development in the state. Brick work and road repair done in the villages with the money of world bank is being projected as the huge progress made by the govt. Actually the farmers were totally neglected by the INLD govt. because none of them was paid any compensation for drought. Chief Minister and his sons are silent over corruption and family-rule since they are themselves involved in these issues.""

The Congress leader has further said,"" The common man in the state has been burdened with the taxes and feels insecure. The water rates have been doubled in the cities. The Chautala family is doing politics on SYL issue for the last thirty years and keep mum when their friend Badal saddles in power in Punjab. The interests of the farmers of Haryana have been sacrificed on this friendship.""

Mr Poonia assailed the chief minister for asking the people to vote in the name of Devi Lal. He said ,"" It is a clear-cut example of red herring only to divert the attention of the people from the real problems. Mere erection of statues of Devi Lal would not help people to solve their problems. The govt. failed to provide basic amenities related to health , education and roads etc. A large number of people from villages are migrating to towns for there is no water or power in rural areas. The chief minister has wasted crores of rupees in foreign jaunts under a false cover to bring investment to the state. Not a single section of society is happy with INLD govt.""
